interesting because um i had been
 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.310 align:start position:0%
interesting because um i had been
thinking<00:00:46.879><c> about</c><00:00:47.120><c> the</c><00:00:47.280><c> notions</c><00:00:47.760><c> of</c><00:00:47.920><c> care</c><00:00:48.160><c> and</c>

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
thinking about the notions of care and
 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.189 align:start position:0%
thinking about the notions of care and
freedom<00:00:48.719><c> and</c><00:00:49.200><c> somewhat</c><00:00:49.600><c> similar</c><00:00:50.239><c> terms</c>

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
you and him about about is it possible
 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.030 align:start position:0%
you and him about about is it possible
to<00:01:07.200><c> actually</c><00:01:07.600><c> change</c><00:01:07.920><c> sensibilities</c><00:01:08.720><c> that</c><00:01:08.799><c> we</c>

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
to actually change sensibilities that we
