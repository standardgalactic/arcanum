In this passage, the author reflects on a significant period from 1984 to 1988, where they and their partner Brit transitioned from discussing ideas about social change to taking concrete actions. This shift was inspired by the need for immediate action rather than deferred plans.

**Background:**
The couple frequently discussed future projects with phrases like "When we finally do this thing..." until Brit challenged them to stop waiting and act immediately. She emphasized that without action, their discussions were meaningless, encapsulated in her statement “TALK – ACTION = 0.”

**Action Taken:**
Motivated by the desire for tangible change, they decided to open a house of hospitality. This involved Brit quitting her job and the author leaving his band, L’etranger, as both felt committed to creating social impact beyond speaking out against injustices.

**Implementation:**
Despite having limited financial resources and only low-paid jobs, they rented a three-bedroom apartment on Ossington and Dupont streets in Toronto. Their plan was to use two of the rooms to provide shelter to those in need.

**Experiences with Guests:**
Several individuals stayed at their home:
- **A student from Newfoundland**, who later collaborated musically with the author.
- **Peter Jellard**, a friend from Edmonton, temporarily resided there until finding his own place.
- An intense homeless man initially lived in one of the rooms but eventually moved out due to compatibility issues.
- **Fergal**, an elusive youth known for manipulation and causing trouble. He taught the author a lesson about being cautious with people who might exploit their naivety.

**Significant Influence - Eddie:**
Eddie was a pivotal figure in their journey. At eighteen, he attended one of L’etranger’s concerts at a peace rally. Despite his learning disabilities, Eddie possessed extensive knowledge about maps, weather, and American geography. His personality could be both amusing and challenging, often reflecting the mood of those around him rather than being inherent to him.

Eddie had specific preferences for independence, rejecting options like group homes for people with similar challenges because he valued making his own decisions. His presence at their home was a defining moment that solidified Brit and the author’s commitment to creating a supportive environment aligned with their values of hospitality and personal empowerment.

This period marks a critical step in their lives where they actively engaged in efforts to address social issues, influenced significantly by those who stayed with them and challenged them along the way.


The narrative describes a series of events and relationships centered around the decision to integrate Eddie, a person struggling with life challenges, into the narrator's home as part of a mutual aid arrangement. Initially, Eddie is invited over for dinners, leading to discussions about him moving in as a friend who would contribute by sharing rent. Despite his difficult job at a manufacturing plant where he faces low wages and bullying, this arrangement aims to provide mutual support.

The situation becomes complex when Eddie reacts violently after enduring harassment at work by smashing a window and damaging the living room. This incident causes concern among the landlord and neighbors, who pressure the narrator's family (Brit and the narrator) to evict Eddie. In their uncertainty about how to handle the situation, they receive guidance from two influential mentors: Father Ted Hyland and Mary Manning Mullins.

Father Ted Hyland, a Jesuit priest committed to community action, advises them on the importance of commitment when inviting people into one's life. He emphasizes that opening your home requires being prepared for long-term relationships with inherent challenges. On the other hand, Mary Manning Mullins, who has experience in social activism and is known for her vibrant personality, encourages embracing imperfection and creating a joyful environment at home. Her encouragement boosts the narrator's confidence in their ability to handle such responsibilities.

Additionally, Gayle Catinella, met during a trip to the Chicago Catholic Worker, shares similar motivations with the narrator’s family—moving from talking about societal issues to actively engaging in solutions. This shared drive underscores the couple's dedication to living out social activism through tangible actions.

As they navigate these challenges, it becomes evident that they need further education on urban social issues to effectively manage their role as a house of hospitality. The experience emphasizes themes of community support, commitment, and the complexities involved in providing aid and acceptance to those in need.


The text describes Brit and the narrator's efforts to engage with grassroots initiatives addressing homelessness and poverty in downtown Toronto during the early 1980s, contrasting their approach with more traditional social-agency methods. The professionals they encountered often saw homeless individuals as "clients" with clinical issues needing resolution. However, Brit and the narrator sought a relationship-based approach, inspired by advocates like John Laurie and organizations such as the Christian Resource Centre.

Their involvement in community activities introduced them to influential figures like Reg Baker, who imparted street wisdom. Despite their lack of financial acumen, they planned to rent a house for communal living with others—a common strategy among musicians and students. However, local activists emphasized that renting was not viable due to gentrification pressures displacing low-income residents.

Gentrification was already transforming Toronto’s urban landscape at the time, driven by demographic shifts from hippies turning into yuppies—youthful professionals seeking urban lifestyles over suburban living. This trend had begun in the post-World War II era when homeownership symbolized success and stability. The 1960s and '70s saw a boom in suburban housing, but by the late '70s, younger generations preferred renovating inner-city homes for both personal and investment purposes.

Recognizing the socio-political implications of gentrification, Brit and the narrator concluded that purchasing property was essential to counteract the displacement occurring in working-class neighborhoods. Owning a home became not just a financial decision but a political stance against ongoing evictions. This understanding underscored their commitment to creating a sustainable house of hospitality as a bulwark for marginalized communities facing urban renewal pressures. Their initiative aimed to provide stability and community support amidst changing city dynamics driven by gentrification.


The passage provides a detailed narrative on the transformation of Toronto's housing market, focusing on gentrification and its effects on various neighborhoods. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Shift in Housing Perception**: The text begins by describing how home ownership transitioned from being a symbol of family and neighborhood stability to an asset for speculation. This change was marked by buying properties at low prices, renovating them, and selling them at higher values.

2. **Impact on Low-Income Residents**: In Toronto's large housing market, gentrification started affecting the poor and lower classes significantly. The strategy of making profits from real estate led to targeting multi-unit dwellings in neighborhoods like Cabbagetown, where rooming houses were turned into upscale homes for wealthier individuals, displacing poorer residents.

3. **Spread of Gentrification**: Initially perceived as positive due to the restoration of old buildings and neighborhood revitalization, gentrification extended from Cabbagetown eastward across Toronto. It moved through various neighborhoods, including De Grassi Street, Broadview Avenue, the Annex, Grange Park, and Bloor West.

4. **Power Dynamics in Gentrification**: Jessa Lingel's perspective emphasizes that gentrification is not merely about physical renovations but involves power dynamics, altering neighborhood demographics, business viability, and employment opportunities.

5. **City Council Concerns**: By 1985, city officials like Jack Layton warned of gentrification's adverse effects on downtown Toronto’s livability. Rising costs were making neighborhoods unaffordable for working-class individuals and young people.

6. **Personal Perspective**: The narrator describes their personal journey in buying a house amidst this economic upheaval, highlighting how areas like Parkdale and South Riverdale appeared as potential options due to their relative affordability at the time.

7. **Characteristics of South Riverdale**: South Riverdale is depicted as a working-class neighborhood with a small-town atmosphere. Factors such as nearby factories (e.g., Colgate-Palmolive, Canada Metals) and industrial activities helped resist gentrification pressures temporarily. The area had a distinct character with country music bars and strip joints, and was known for its local biker gang presence.

Overall, the passage captures the complex socio-economic changes in Toronto's housing market during the late 20th century, illustrating both the allure and challenges of gentrification from multiple perspectives.


In the spring of 1985, two individuals—referred to as "Brit" and the narrator—decided to purchase a house despite having no money saved. The opportunity arose when they learned that Youth Corps, a Diocesan organization, had funds intended for starting a Catholic Worker house but hadn't progressed with their plans. With $14,000 available in a bank account, the narrator approached Father Tom McKillop of Youth Corps to propose using the money to establish their own Catholic Worker house, emphasizing independence from any influence by Youth Corps on operations.

To the narrator's surprise, Youth Corps agreed, with the condition that if the house were closed, the funds would be repaid. No formal documents were signed, and the entire sum was handed over as a cheque for the down payment on a home they purchased later that summer.

The house, a three-storey semi-detached building located near Greenwood and Queen, had been used as a group home and was listed at $85,000—significantly below its market value. This allowed them to manage a monthly mortgage of around $1,500, with the expectation that all occupants would contribute financially.

The excitement over acquiring the house led Brit and the narrator to move in before receiving the keys from their real estate agent, using an unconventional entry by pushing in a back window. Friends helped set up the donated furniture while some young volunteers contributed to refurbishing efforts like plastering and painting.

Living arrangements included two bedrooms on the top floor: one occupied by Eddie, who brought his collection of licence plates and maps, and another by Kelly, their first volunteer from a gig in Hamilton. Brit and the narrator took the smallest bedroom on the second floor, leaving larger rooms for additional beds to accommodate multiple people. The main floor had a front room serving as an emergency overnight space.

They named their house "Angelus Catholic Worker House," inspired by the traditional call-and-response prayer associated with Mary's response in the Gospel of Luke, reflecting their mission to make a tangible impact in their neighborhood through hospitality and community engagement.

At twenty-two, the narrator had been working on this project for a year alongside Brit, who was twenty-five. The initiative lacked formal structure or visibility; there were no phone listings or directory entries. Instead, word-of-mouth became their primary means of attracting people to their house of hospitality.


The passage describes the evolution of Angelus House, a community effort aimed at providing mutual aid and support to those in need, against the backdrop of shifting socio-economic dynamics in urban settings.

In its early days, Angelus House operated on an idealistic model where residents shared responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. This communal living setup allowed individuals seeking help—many of whom stayed temporarily—to contribute by helping with rent if they remained for over a month. The community was built on the belief that mutual aid could facilitate transitions from homelessness to stability.

Initially, the clientele primarily consisted of transient men dealing with addictions and older women grappling with mental health issues. Children or families were rarely seen at this time. Assistance provided ranged from meals and coffee to helping individuals secure more stable living arrangements through local housing cooperatives and federally funded social housing options. This federal investment in social housing had been a significant post-World War II development, offering thousands of units annually as a pathway out of precarious situations.

However, the narrative shifts with two major developments: gentrification and changes in government policy. Gentrification increased property values downtown, making it harder for low-income individuals to find affordable housing. Concurrently, federal investment in social housing dwindled, starting significantly when Brian Mulroney's Conservative government took office in 1984. This reduction in funding resulted in longer waiting lists and more people falling through the cracks of the support system.

The introduction of Caroline to Angelus House marks a shift in the demographics they served. Arriving in 1986, she embodied this new demographic: an older woman with distinct personality traits and eccentricities who quickly became a beloved figure within the community. Her presence highlights how the changing needs and profiles of those seeking help required more flexibility and accommodation from Angelus House.

Over time, the house saw an increasing number of individuals in need, illustrated by people like Reggie—a quiet but peculiar resident whose habits caused unease among others. This growing demand reflected broader societal changes that made living spaces less accessible to marginalized populations.

Overall, this passage underscores how community-driven initiatives must adapt to shifting economic and political landscapes while maintaining their core mission of support and mutual aid.


The passage describes a challenging situation faced by a group living together, who were attempting to provide temporary housing and support for individuals in need. Initially, they accommodated a man recently released from jail, despite some reservations about his presence. This decision set a precedent for accepting others without traditional housing options.

Soon after, Jo-Anne, an alcoholic recovering woman with her five-year-old son George—who had severe asthma—arrived at their doorstep. Despite being turned away by shelters due to full capacity, the group decided to take her and George in. Their compassionate approach was exemplified when they attended to George's emergency health issue, driving him to a hospital and staying until he was stable.

The situation intensified with the arrival of Sandy, a young woman with twin babies who had no place to stay after their car broke down in the rain. Despite having no extra space, they let her in, swelling their numbers from twelve to fourteen. This added burden strained resources and attention among the residents, especially as it became clear that Sandy was neglecting her twins while pursuing an affair.

The care for the undernourished and developmentally delayed twins fell to the rest of the house members, leading to exhaustion and frustration. A city nurse's assessment confirmed their poor condition, but conflicting opinions with Sandy’s doctor complicated potential interventions. Tensions escalated among the house residents as they grappled with these pressures.

Ultimately, Sandy left unexpectedly with her babies, leaving behind a tense environment and unresolved issues. The group was overwhelmed by the complexity and number of needs, highlighting the limitations of their capacity to help in such challenging circumstances.


The passage reflects on personal experiences and observations related to homelessness, particularly focusing on changes over time in Toronto. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Personal Experience**: The narrator recalls their involvement with Caroline, who had mental health issues. While initially benefiting from the stability provided by the narrator’s home, Caroline became combative as tensions rose and instability increased within the household. Her eventual departure left the narrator regretful for not doing more to support her.

2. **Insight into Homelessness**: The experience highlighted that simply offering temporary relief (like a bed or meal) is insufficient for addressing homelessness. A stable living environment is crucial for helping individuals transition to stability, but as housing options became scarce, difficult decisions about who could remain were necessary.

3. **Observations in Toronto's East End**: Decades later, the narrator revisits the same area where they had previously worked with the homeless. They discover that conditions have worsened significantly, with extreme poverty existing alongside significant wealth. Homeless individuals are now more visibly living on streets and in parks, a stark contrast to past circumstances.

4. **Broader Context**: The disparity observed isn't unique to urban areas; it exists across communities nationwide. Approximately 35,000 people experience homelessness nightly across the country. This is described as an abnormal situation that resulted from policy decisions since the 1980s.

5. **Historical Perspective**: David Hulchanski’s work is referenced to provide context. Before 1980, homelessness wasn't recognized as a widespread social issue. Shelters focused on transient men with substance use issues who could find temporary accommodation if they managed to sober up.

6. **Terminology and Policy Changes**: The term "homeless" was not prevalent in social work before the 1980s, indicating a shift in how society and policymakers view and address homelessness. This change reflects a broader societal recognition of homelessness as a complex issue needing comprehensive solutions rather than temporary fixes.

Overall, the passage underscores the evolution of homelessness as both a recognized crisis and a result of systemic neglect. It calls attention to the need for stable housing solutions and more compassionate policies to support those affected by homelessness.


The rise of homelessness in Canada became particularly prominent by the late 1980s and escalated into a significant social crisis in the early 1990s. This situation worsened following key policy changes initiated by Paul Martin, then Liberal finance minister, who eliminated federal involvement in public housing programs. In 1993, Martin's administration canceled $600 million worth of planned new housing projects, claiming that private sector initiatives would fill this gap. However, the privatization shift primarily benefited real estate speculation and luxury developments rather than addressing affordable housing needs.

This federal withdrawal signaled to provincial governments a broader trend toward reducing social support services. Subsequent cuts included basic welfare benefits, disability pensions, mental health services, and addiction programs. These reductions often had political undertones, as evidenced by Alberta Premier Ralph Klein's derogatory remarks at a homeless shelter, and Ontario Premier Mike Harris's government slashing welfare supports by 21 percent—suggesting that those in need simply lacked initiative.

These policies led to widespread hardship among various vulnerable groups, including students, the elderly, and working families. The consequences of these policy decisions have been significant, with approximately 235,000 Canadians experiencing homelessness annually. This crisis has underscored the importance of public housing and mental health investments—not as mere expenses but as essential components of a civilized society.

Critics argue that cutting social programs is economically misguided. The cost of homelessness to Canada is estimated at $7 billion annually, representing not only financial burdens but also profound human suffering through lost lives and shattered aspirations. Therefore, revisiting these policies with the support from historical evidence and data could challenge the normalization of such neglectful practices.
