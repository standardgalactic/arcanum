**Chapter 2: OPERATION BREAK - The Working Class**

As 1980 began, the narrator had simple aspirations: quit school, play in a band, and find employment. However, job opportunities were scarce during this period due to widespread deindustrialization impacting major cities like Toronto. Factories and warehouses that once thrived along the city's industrial belt were closing down, leaving many workers unemployed. Areas such as Riverdale, the Junction, Liberty Village, and Spadina Avenue were filled with empty buildings—a testament to the economic downturn.

During the mid-1970s, Toronto experienced a significant phase of deindustrialization, resulting in the closure of garment factories, slaughterhouses, and warehouses. This transformation led to an emerging opportunity for young artists who could afford to rent large lofts at low prices, such as $266 per month. Lorraine Segato, associated with feminist bands like Mama Quilla II, capitalized on these opportunities, moving into the burgeoning Queen Street arts scene.

The narrator, eager to escape their home in Scarborough, faced limited job prospects. The options were mostly in low-paying roles or precarious commission-based gigs. Despite relentless efforts, responses from the want ads were non-existent. This struggle reflects a broader economic reality: Canada was experiencing one of its most severe economic crises since the Great Depression.

The crisis wasn't confined to Canada; it reached across North America with numerous steel mills, garment factories, and manufacturing plants in the United States shutting down permanently. Millions lost well-paid union jobs, forcing remaining workers to choose between wage cuts, benefit erosion, or unemployment.

A critical distinction existed between the economic turmoil of 1980 and that of the Great Depression. The 1929 collapse was unexpected, leaving politicians and economists puzzled. In contrast, the downturn in 1980 was not accidental but strategically influenced by policies championed by economist Milton Friedman. His ideas significantly shaped the era's economic strategies.

The document "Free to Choose: A Personal Statement," released on January 1, 1980, by Milton and Rose Friedman, epitomized this ideological shift. While figures like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were symbolic of the time's excesses or austerity measures, it was Friedman's principles that underpinned many of these policies.

In summary, Chapter 2 depicts a period marked by economic hardship, particularly in Toronto’s working-class communities, exacerbated by deindustrialization and influenced by neoliberal economic strategies advocated by Milton Friedman. This context shaped the lives and opportunities available to individuals during this time.


The passage discusses Milton Friedman's influence as a proponent of economic ideas centered around capitalism, particularly through his role in promoting these views via a syndicated weekly television series. This series propagated the belief that government intervention is detrimental while capitalism, driven by market forces—referred to as the "invisible hand"—is inherently beneficial.

Friedman was associated with the Chicago School of economics, which held revolutionary views against the post-World War II economic consensus that advocated a balanced interplay between public and private interests for societal prosperity. Instead, they posited that businesses should prioritize profit maximization without considering social responsibilities. This perspective suggested limiting governmental roles to providing tax benefits for the wealthy and reducing regulations.

The passage contrasts this ideology with the achievements of the American labor movement in shaping the twentieth-century middle class through union activities like the Flint sit-down strike (1936-37), which marked a shift away from poor working conditions. This era saw substantial worker gains, including better wages, pensions, and social mobility opportunities, underpinned by President Roosevelt’s New Deal programs.

However, Friedman dismissed these developments as leading to "tyranny and misery." Despite his marginal status in economic circles during the 1960s and early '70s, he gained an opportunity to apply his theories when advising Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1975. The context of this experiment was marked by severe political repression following a coup backed by the CIA. Unfortunately for Friedman's theories, the implementation led to economic turmoil in Chile, with inflation skyrocketing and the economy collapsing.

Overall, the passage critiques Friedman’s economic approach as fundamentally flawed, highlighting its adverse outcomes when applied without consideration of social responsibilities or democratic principles.


The passage discusses the significant economic changes and challenges faced by both Chile and the United States during the late 20th century, particularly in the context of neoliberal economic policies influenced by the Chicago School of Economics.

### Background Context:
1. **Manufacturing Job Losses (1974-1983):** Between 1974 and 1983, over 177,000 jobs were lost in the U.S. manufacturing sector. This decline affected both the middle and working classes, leading to reduced economic stability for many Americans.

2. **Chilean Economic Reforms:** In Chile, Milton Friedman's economic policies, which were implemented during Augusto Pinochet's regime, led to a significant transfer of public assets into private hands, particularly benefiting the wealthy elite. Naomi Klein, in her book "The Shock Doctrine," critiques these changes as not being purely free-market but rather a strategic move by a small elite that resulted in substantial wealth accumulation funded by public resources.

### Friedman’s Influence and Economic Strategy:
3. **Application to the United States:** Milton Friedman saw potential for applying his economic strategies—characterized by reducing government intervention and promoting free markets—to the U.S. The New Deal's cooperative model among labor, big business, and government had been undermined by inflation and economic stagnation exacerbated by the 1973 energy crisis.

4. **Corporate Leaders' Perspective:** By the late 1970s, influential figures like Ronald Reagan believed that the U.S. was ripe for adopting Friedman’s methods. Friedman himself noted a growing recognition of the drawbacks of big government in Western countries, suggesting political support for his ideas.

### Hayek's Proposal and Implementation:
5. **Social and Political Challenges:** Implementing such drastic changes faced potential resistance due to their social and political implications. Friedrich Hayek proposed creating an economic crisis akin to the Great Depression to force acceptance of these policies by making workers more vulnerable economically.

6. **Paul Volcker’s Actions:** The strategy was partially enacted through Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's monetary policy decisions. Initially, in 1980, Volcker increased interest rates sharply to 13%, causing significant economic disruption and job losses. A second increase followed in 1981, pushing rates above 21%. These actions led to a severe recession as consumer spending plummeted and defaults on loans became widespread.

### Outcome:
7. **Economic Impact:** The intentional economic shocks created wage insecurity and weakened the power of labor, aligning with Hayek's vision of restoring capital dominance in the economy. While these policies contributed to long-term structural changes that some argue helped stabilize inflation and promote growth later on, they also resulted in immediate hardship for many Americans.

In summary, this passage illustrates a strategic approach by economic theorists and policymakers to reshape U.S. economic policy through intentional crisis engineering, drawing lessons from Chile's experience under Friedman's influence. The result was significant short-term pain with long-lasting structural changes.


The passage describes significant economic and political shifts in the United States during the early 1980s, focusing on changes that affected workers and industries heavily reliant on unionized labor.

### Economic Context
1. **Mortgages and Corporate Raids**: Small and midsized companies faced financial challenges due to rising interest rates, making them vulnerable to corporate raiders—entities or individuals who would buy and often dismantle these companies for profit.
   
2. **Paul Volcker's Policies**: As the Federal Reserve Chairman, Paul Volcker implemented high-interest rate policies to combat inflation, which had a negative impact on workers' standard of living. This policy was part of a broader economic strategy that prioritized controlling inflation over immediate employment concerns.

### Political and Labor Context
1. **Impact on Unions**: President Ronald Reagan's administration took drastic measures against unionized labor. The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981 ended with Reagan firing over 11,000 striking workers and banning them from future federal employment, signaling a strong stance against unions.

2. **Union Movement Response**: This action was unprecedented in the postwar era and marked a significant shift in labor relations. It emboldened corporate America to reduce wages, benefits, and job security for unionized workers.

### Industry-Specific Impacts
1. **Automotive and Steel Industries**: The passage highlights severe job losses in key industries like automotive (e.g., the Big Three—GM, Ford, and Chrysler) and steel manufacturing. These sectors experienced massive layoffs as companies faced economic pressures and competition.

2. **Community Responses**: In response to these crises, communities organized efforts to address job losses and economic devastation. The example of Youngstown, Ohio, illustrates such grassroots activism where local religious leaders, like Bishops James Malone and John Burt, collaborated with workers to attempt a community takeover of steel mills after significant job cuts.

### Role of Religious Leaders
1. **Bishop James Malone**: As the son of a steelworker and influenced by Saul Alinsky's grassroots activism, Bishop Malone represents a unique period in American Catholic history where Church officials supported labor movements. Despite conservative religious stances, these leaders often aligned with workers' struggles to improve living conditions.

In summary, this passage outlines a challenging era for American workers and industries due to aggressive economic policies and political actions that weakened unions and led to significant job losses. It also highlights the critical role of community activism and religious leadership in advocating for workers during these turbulent times.


The passage provides a critical analysis of how policies during Ronald Reagan's presidency significantly impacted American communities, especially industrial towns like Youngstown, Ohio. It suggests that political decisions made by both Democrats and Republicans led to the decline of industries in these areas instead of preserving them through worker control.

### Key Points:

1. **Youngstown's Decline**: The passage describes how Youngstown could have been a symbol of American resilience but was allowed to deteriorate due to political choices. Bruce Springsteen's song "Youngstown" is cited as reflecting the sentiment that politicians and capitalists contributed more to dismantling industrial communities than external threats like Hitler.

2. **Operation Break the Working Class**: This term encapsulates efforts to weaken worker confidence and organized labor, coinciding with significant wealth transfer to the financial elite. Reagan’s policies are highlighted for redistributing resources upwards, contributing to a substantial federal debt increase and turning the U.S. into the world's largest debtor nation.

3. **Impact of Reaganomics**: The era is noted for reducing regulations that had balanced the postwar economy. Financial deregulation led to risky borrowing and speculation, creating economic instability. The working and middle classes bore the brunt of these changes as the market was inundated with junk bonds and high-risk financial products.

4. **Financial Crises**:
   - **Savings and Loans Crisis (Late 1980s)**: Resulting from deregulation, this crisis led to reckless speculation in savings institutions, causing a collapse that required a $132 billion taxpayer-funded bailout.
   - **2007–2010 Subprime Mortgage Crisis**: This was linked to Reagan-era policies allowing speculative financial practices like credit default swaps. The crisis severely affected home ownership and savings for millions.

5. **Long-term Effects**: The passage credits the Reagan/Friedman economic revolution with reshaping U.S. society, politics, and economy over four decades. It lists adverse outcomes such as increased income inequality, executive compensation inflation, corporate scandals, and societal materialism as part of this legacy.

In summary, the text argues that policy decisions in the late 20th century, particularly those under Reagan, facilitated significant economic shifts that disadvantaged workers and destabilized financial systems, leading to long-lasting negative consequences for American society.


The passage highlights significant economic and social issues in the United States, emphasizing how political rhetoric and misinformation have obscured critical historical truths. It argues that understanding these realities is crucial to addressing ongoing challenges.

### Key Points:

1. **Political Climate**: The text suggests that toxic political discourse and disinformation, stemming from deep-seated cultural divisions (red state/blue state), have masked the true history and current struggles of American workers.

2. **Economic Disparities**: Over the past four decades, there has been a substantial decline in economic opportunities for American workers across various metrics. A 2020 study by the Rand Corporation underscores this issue by linking economic disparity to political instability.

3. **Income Losses**:
   - The study found that since 1980, working-class Black men have lost approximately $26,000 annually compared to what they would have earned if income growth had continued as before.
   - College-educated workers experienced even greater losses, earning between $48,000 and $63,000 less per year.

4. **Impact on Wealth Distribution**: The Rand report attributes these wage losses directly to the financial gains of the wealthiest 1% of the population. It quantifies this loss at about $1,144 per month for each worker over four decades, amounting to a staggering $50 trillion in lost wages and benefits.

5. **Systemic Causes**: The text argues that these economic disparities are not natural but rather the result of deliberate policies, metaphorically termed "Operation Break the Working Class." This operation is blamed for enriching billionaires at the expense of the working class through what it describes as wage theft.

6. **Historical Context**: The reference to economists from the University of Chicago suggests an ideological backdrop related to neoliberal economic policies that may have influenced these outcomes, although this connection is not explicitly detailed in the passage.

In summary, the passage paints a picture of systemic inequality exacerbated by political and economic strategies over several decades, resulting in significant financial losses for American workers while disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest individuals. It calls attention to the need for historical awareness and factual clarity to address these entrenched issues.
