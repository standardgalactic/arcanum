### Summary of Chapter 19: "The Banquet of the Corporate Cardinal"

#### Context
In 1987, a group from Angelus House attended Cardinal Emmett G. Carter's annual charity banquet not as formal guests but as gatecrashers with a purpose. Their goal was to discuss increasing economic disparity with the influential cardinal.

#### The Setting and Attendees
The event was an elegant affair, attended by Canada’s political and business leaders in tuxedos and evening gowns. It highlighted Cardinal Carter's connections within the corporate and political realms of Canada. Despite Jesus’s teachings that emphasize inviting the marginalized to banquets (as noted in Matthew 22:14), the banquet predominantly featured affluent attendees.

#### Historical Background
Cardinal Carter first hosted this banquet during the challenging economic climate of the early 1980s recession. Over time, it gained prestige and was attended by high-profile figures such as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Elected on promises to rejuvenate Canada's economy, Mulroney’s tenure saw persistent unemployment but also significant growth for a select group.

#### Economic Climate
The chapter describes the economic environment of the 1980s under Mulroney's leadership. While more than a million Canadians remained unemployed, those in advantageous positions benefited from an economy driven by real estate speculation and consumer spending. This era was marked by conspicuous consumption, as seen with the Mulroneys' ostentatious lifestyle.

#### Political Influence and Wealth
The chapter highlights a shift in focus from employment rates to wealth generation during this period. Stevie Cameron notes that Mulroney’s government prioritized wealth, insider access, and deal-making. This change transformed lobbying into a more overt industry in Ottawa. The Mulroneys hosted exclusive events for major donors, granting them significant access to influential government figures.

#### Conclusion
The chapter paints a picture of an era where economic disparities widened, with political and corporate elites benefiting disproportionately. It underscores the disconnect between religious teachings on charity and the practices of those in power during this period in Canadian history.


The passage provides a critical overview of the shift in economic ideology during the 1980s, focusing on how this period was marked by an embrace of greed as a positive force within capitalism. This new mindset is often symbolized by New York financier Ivan Boesky's infamous pronouncement "greed is good" and further popularized by Gordon Gekko’s character in the 1987 film "Wall Street." Despite Boesky's subsequent imprisonment for insider trading, his message resonated with a broader cultural shift toward a more aggressive form of capitalism characterized by high finance and speculative ventures.

During this era, there was a notable departure from the previous century's model where corporate managers were valued for their loyalty and focus on long-term brand building. Instead, the 1980s saw the rise of "corporate raiders," opportunistic financiers who prioritized short-term gains over the sustainability or ethical management of companies. These individuals often dismantled well-established businesses to extract maximum value from them, with little concern for the consequences faced by employees or other stakeholders.

The narrative highlights Conrad Black as a quintessential example of this predatory capitalism within Canada. In 1978, he gained control of Dominion Stores, a prominent and successful Canadian grocery chain at the time. Under his management, Black initiated aggressive asset sell-offs to gain access to surplus funds accumulated for employee pensions, reflecting a broader trend seen in the United States where defined company pension plans dramatically declined from over 60% in 1980 to just 10% by 2006. This shift led many workers to extend their careers beyond retirement age due to inadequate financial resources.

Black's actions at Dominion Stores not only destabilized the corporate structure but also eroded its reputation, prompting shareholder complaints about his damaging impact on the company. This case exemplifies how the ethos of the era prioritized personal and shareholder enrichment over the well-being of employees and the long-term health of corporations. The transformation from a focus on stewardship to one on asset stripping marked a significant cultural and economic shift in North American business practices during this period.


The raiding of the Dominion pension fund marked a pivotal moment in Canadian labor relations following World War II. This event is particularly significant due to its connections with notable figures such as Conrad Black, a prominent corporate raider, and Cardinal Carter, a leading religious figure at that time.

Conrad Black was not only celebrated at a banquet hosted by Cardinal Carter but also shared a close personal relationship with him, including spiritual guidance from Black. Both men aligned in their efforts to suppress the progressive faction within the Canadian Catholic Church, which advocated for higher moral standards among capitalists like Black.

The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) was known globally for its advocacy on social justice, Indigenous rights, and economic reforms. On New Year's Eve 1982, they issued a bold statement condemning the prevailing economic strategies that justified mass layoffs to combat inflation. They criticized these measures as morally bankrupt, attributing them to Milton Friedman’s Chicago School of economics, which prioritized profit over human labor.

This denunciation by the Church caused ripples among Canada's political and business circles, dominating national discourse on the economic crisis. The bishops engaged in unprecedented dialogues with labor movements, anti-poverty coalitions, and feminist groups, fostering hopes for a democratic social movement. However, Cardinal Carter was vehemently opposed to this statement, denouncing it at an unexpected press conference and creating an unusual public rift within the Catholic hierarchy.

Cardinal Carter's resistance was two-pronged: he privately gathered clerical allies to counteract the progressive bishops while publicly, through his wife Barbara Amiel and Conrad Black, he attacked the bishops' positions. Amiel criticized them as susceptible to Marxist influences tied to a global communist agenda, highlighting the ideological clash within the Church.

This period underscored significant tensions between economic ideologies and moral considerations in Canada's postwar society, reflecting broader conflicts between progressive religious movements and entrenched business interests.


The passage provides a narrative of internal conflicts within the Canadian Catholic Church during the 1980s, focusing on efforts to reform the Church and address socio-economic issues affecting the underprivileged. Here is a detailed summary and explanation:

### Conclusion

The passage highlights a period of significant ideological struggle within the Canadian Catholic Church, where traditional authority figures faced challenges from progressive elements advocating for greater economic equity and social justice. These efforts were met with resistance from those aligned with established power structures, reflecting broader societal debates on wealth distribution and moral responsibility.


The passage describes a series of strategic and ideological shifts within the Canadian Catholic Church during the 1980s, focusing on the decline of social justice initiatives and the consolidation of clerical power.

Initially, the Canadian bishops were notably active in global research on social justice issues, contributing significantly with their efforts. However, this period saw a concerted push to dismantle these progressive elements under the guise of organizational "efficiencies." A consulting firm, experienced in privatizing public services for the Thatcher government, was hired and recommended terminating the social justice research team and outsourcing their work.

This move effectively shut down the social justice wing of the bishops' council. It also facilitated the removal of Bishop De Roo from his position due to pressure from conservative figures like Carter and Black, who had been vocal critics.

Upon Cardinal Carter's retirement in 1988, he joined Conrad Black’s Argus Corporation board, which later became embroiled in corporate fraud scandals. Carter was replaced by Aloysius Ambrozic, a hard-right figure aligned with Pope John Paul II's ideology. Ambrozic quickly initiated further conservative measures: shutting down the Youth Corps program and closing six out of eleven regional social justice ministries.

The retrenchment observed during this period was part of a broader trend across the Catholic Church, moving away from the progressive ideals spurred by Vatican II in the 1960s. Joe Mihevc, a Canadian civic politician, notes that John Paul II reversed many of these advancements by reinforcing clerical authority and marginalizing lay people and women.

This shift mirrored global religious counter-revolutions led by figures like Khomeini, Reagan, Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II, who sought to reverse the progressive changes of previous decades. This conservative pivot was emphasized during John Paul II's first visit to North America in 1980 when Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, his tour manager, controversially barred women from participating on the altar.

The passage concludes by alluding to a forthcoming crisis that would further challenge the Church: widespread allegations of systemic sexual abuse emerging in the late 1980s. This scandal was poised to profoundly impact and destabilize an institution with a two-thousand-year history.
