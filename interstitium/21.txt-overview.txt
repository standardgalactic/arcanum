Chapter 21 of the book titled "The Summer the Planet Could Have Been Saved" provides a detailed account of pivotal events during the summer of 1988, marked by extreme heat and growing awareness about climate change.

### Overview:

1. **Heat Wave of 1988**: 
   - The summer was exceptionally hot, becoming the hottest on record in the U.S., with six of the previous seven highest temperature records set in the 1980s.
   - This was not seen as a random weather event but a sign of significant climate change.

2. **Political Response**:
   - In late June 1988, the U.S. Senate held special hearings on the greenhouse effect, signaling increased political attention to global warming.
   - Dr. James E. Hansen from NASA testified about the certainty within the scientific community that human-made carbon dioxide was altering the planet's atmosphere.

3. **Scientific and Corporate Awareness**:
   - Despite public concern, major oil companies like Exxon were already aware of climate change impacts due to extensive research dating back to the 1950s.
   - Edward Teller had warned about potential environmental catastrophe from increased oil production, predicting significant temperature changes by 2000.

4. **Corporate Actions and Inactions**:
   - Internal reports within these companies predicted serious consequences if emissions were not reduced. For example, a 1982 memo suggested that damage might be irreversible.
   - Despite this knowledge, such reports were kept secret from the public to protect corporate interests.

5. **Specific Example – Shell Oil**:
   - In 1988, Shell received an analysis confirming previous predictions about global warming but chose to suppress it publicly.
   - While they did not inform the public, Shell prepared for future sea-level rise by redesigning their offshore rigs to withstand a six-foot increase in ocean levels.

### Implications:

- This chapter highlights the early recognition of climate change risks by scientific and corporate entities during the late 20th century.
- It underscores a significant disparity between what was known by corporations and scientists versus public knowledge and political action at that time.
- The narrative suggests missed opportunities for earlier intervention to mitigate global warming effects, emphasizing a critical period when decisive actions could have potentially altered environmental outcomes.

This summary captures the tension between early awareness of climate change impacts and the subsequent actions—or lack thereof—by key players in both government and industry.


The passage describes a significant period in the history of environmental policy and activism, focusing on how disinformation campaigns by the fossil fuel industry affected public perception and government action regarding climate change. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Disinformation Campaigns**: The oil industry engaged in widespread efforts to undermine scientific research related to climate change. They invested heavily in spreading misinformation through fraudulent studies, hired influencers, and created false front groups to sow doubt about the scientifically established links between fossil fuel emissions and global warming.

2. **Canadian Involvement**: According to Geoff Dembicki in "The Petroleum Papers," Canada played a role in these disinformation campaigns, particularly due to increased oil sands production north of Fort McMurray, which is notably polluting.

3. **Public Perception Shifts**: The impact of these disinformation efforts was profound. At the start of the 1990s, 88% of Americans recognized climate change as a serious issue. By the decade's end, this number plummeted to just 28%.

4. **Government Research and Response**:
   - In the late 1970s, under President Carter, a scientific panel was formed to study the link between carbon emissions and climate instability.
   - The 1979 report "Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment" confirmed that human activities were driving climate change, predicting significant global temperature increases.
   - President Carter responded by promoting renewable energy. For instance, during his presidency, solar energy costs dropped significantly from $77 per kilowatt-hour to $25, and today the cost is around 0.06 cents per kilowatt-hour.

5. **Policy Reversal under Reagan**: The incoming Reagan administration reversed many of Carter's initiatives. Notably, it eliminated tax incentives for solar technology development, undermining efforts toward renewable energy solutions.

6. **Rising Environmental Activism**:
   - By the late 1980s, global environmental activism was growing, with grassroots campaigns and legal actions targeting pollution and environmental degradation.
   - Groups like Earth First! emerged in 1980, using direct action tactics to oppose corporate logging practices.
   - Protests such as those in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, saw over eight hundred arrests during efforts to prevent old-growth forest clear-cutting.
   - In Temagami, Ontario, Indigenous activists played a crucial role in defending their traditional lands.

7. **Potential for Unified Action**: The passage concludes on an optimistic note, suggesting that there was a possibility in the late 1980s for science, activism, and government to collaborate effectively against the climate crisis.

Overall, this period highlights both significant challenges posed by disinformation and powerful counter-movements driven by grassroots activists and scientific communities striving for environmental protection and sustainability.


The passage reflects on a critical period in climate history around 1988 when significant steps could have been taken to mitigate climate change, as reported by *The New York Times*. During this time, after Dr. James Hansen’s landmark testimony before Congress about global warming, various efforts were made at both national and international levels.

In Canada, the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing environmental issues such as industrial pollution affecting North American lakes. He also worked with the Reagan administration on a treaty aimed at reducing acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide emissions from smelters.

The narrative then shifts to a personal story set in 1988, where Brit and the author were preparing for parenthood amid the rising awareness of climate change. Their first daughter, Mariah, was born that summer, an event humorously intertwined with local happenings involving Shirley, their neighbor involved in local disturbances. This anecdote serves as a backdrop to reflect on how global concerns about climate change have been part of daily life over the decades.

The passage then emphasizes how records for hottest summers were continuously broken from 1988 through 2023, with scientists by 2024 expressing grave concern that global temperatures are “off the charts.” The rapid pace of climate change has led to extreme weather events such as wildfires, droughts, and storms. This pattern aligns closely with predictions made decades earlier.

Overall, the text highlights a decade when decisive action on climate change was possible but underscores the ongoing challenges faced due to accelerated climate impacts that were underestimated or not fully anticipated by early models and reports.


The passage highlights significant environmental challenges and historical responses to ecological threats, particularly focusing on climate change and ozone layer depletion.

### Climate Change and Ice Shelf Collapse
- **Ice Shelves:** Environmental predictions about ice shelf collapse were initially underestimated by the oil lobby. For instance, in 1995, researchers were surprised when a large portion of Larsen A Ice Shelf collapsed over just a few days. Subsequently, other ice shelves like Wilkins and Larsen B also disintegrated.
- **Recent Events:** In March 2022, Antarctica experienced unprecedented temperatures, leading to the collapse of an area comparable in size to Los Angeles. This event strained the remaining parts of the Larsen C shelf, with fears that a complete loss of western Antarctic ice fields could raise sea levels by twenty feet, causing irreversible impacts on global ecosystems and human life.

### Historical Context of Fossil Fuel Awareness
- **Knowledge vs. Action:** Decades ago, fossil fuel companies were aware of their harmful impact on the planet but chose to ignore or lie about it. Despite growing evidence of climate change's effects, industries like Canada’s oil sector continue prioritizing production over environmental concerns.
- **Global Criticism:** UN Secretary-General António Guterres has criticized these corporations for ignoring scientific warnings and continuing to expand fossil fuel production despite its incompatibility with human survival.

### Geological Epoch Change
- **New Geological Era:** The planet has entered a new, unstable geological epoch due to climate change. Since 1988, environmental conditions have shifted dramatically, marking a departure from the relatively stable climates experienced by previous generations.
  
### Lessons from Ozone Layer Protection Efforts
- **Montreal Protocol Success:** In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was established to address the rapid deterioration of the ozone layer caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Despite initial resistance and criticism, the protocol succeeded due to its structure.
    - **Annual Meetings:** Regular meetings ensured continuous evaluation and adjustment of objectives, leading to widespread adoption by 197 nations.
    - **Collaborative Effort:** The success of this international agreement demonstrates that coordinated global action can effectively address human-caused environmental threats.

### Conclusion
The passage underscores the urgent need for collaborative efforts in combating climate change, drawing parallels with past successes like the Montreal Protocol. It highlights the detrimental effects of fossil fuel dependency and emphasizes the importance of scientific integrity and collective responsibility to safeguard the planet's future.
