**Chapter 18: Folk Devils and Mass Shooters**

This chapter delves into life at Angelus House, where dinner is portrayed as a vibrant gathering filled with conversation, laughter, and music. The atmosphere can be so lively that outsiders might mistake it for a party. A lawyer seeking a supportive community home for a young man becomes momentarily confused by the bustling ambiance.

At Angelus House, an eclectic mix of individuals come together at mealtime. Among them is Manuel, a young Mexican man striving to learn English with everyone's help; Dean, who carries a facial scar and often harasses women in the house under the guise of being a hairdresser; and Maria, an Italian woman who fled an abusive marriage and mistakenly believed she was the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary. The diversity and complexity of these characters illustrate the challenges and dynamics within the community.

To maintain engaging dinner conversations, topics like hockey or baseball are often broached with male residents from the streets. However, they have a particular fascination with sensational crime news, especially serial killers. Their living room is filled with biographies of infamous serial killers such as Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and the Green River Killer.

The chapter highlights how each era grapples with cultural insecurities by creating "folk devils" and moral panics—symbols or groups that are blamed for societal issues. The 1980s were rife with these phenomena, fueled by sensationalist media narratives about satanic cults, ritualistic child abuse, and myths like the generation of "crack babies." Serial killers became a focal point of cultural panic during this time. Popular culture was captivated not only by their heinous crimes but also by portraying them as misunderstood geniuses. This trend reached its peak with Thomas Harris's novel *Silence of the Lambs* (1988), which depicted serial killer Hannibal Lecter in an intellectual battle with law enforcement—a narrative that garnered critical acclaim, including five Academy Awards for its film adaptation.

The 1980s also saw a surge in Hollywood films centered on psychopathic killers, propelled by the rise of the slasher genre. This cultural preoccupation reflects broader societal fears and fascinations, illustrating how media representations can shape public perceptions and anxieties.


The text provides an overview of the cultural impact of serial-killer slasher films from the 1970s and 1980s, such as "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." These movies not only generated multimedia franchises—encompassing comic books, TV series, and merchandise—but also propelled various actors to fame, including Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Jennifer Connelly.

The 1980s are referred to as the "golden years" for serial killers due to a peak in such crimes during this period. Research indicates a rise in serial killings starting from the 1960s, peaking in the 1980s with at least two hundred active serial killers in the United States alone. The decline began towards the end of the century.

Canadian researcher Peter Vronsky suggests that the "golden age" of serial killing can be attributed to several factors:
1. Postwar family trauma and dysfunction within the baby boom generation, where many identified serial killers came from homes affected by fathers with PTSD.
2. A lack of modern technology such as cell phones and DNA evidence, coupled with police databases primarily consisting of paper records, made it easier for these crimes to go undetected.

The text also highlights a significant bias in media coverage, noting that police and public attention was disproportionately focused on white victims and perpetrators, often neglecting crimes against racialized individuals. In Canada, this oversight extended to the numerous murders and disappearances of Indigenous women, particularly along the notorious Highway of Tears in British Columbia, where multiple serial killers targeted vulnerable Indigenous women.

The document points out a major political event in 2023 when Manitoba's provincial Conservative government was pressured over its refusal to search a landfill for the bodies of Indigenous women killed by a serial killer. This issue played a role in their electoral defeat and brought attention to campaigns like the red dress campaign, which raises awareness about violence against Indigenous women.

Additionally, while the 1980s were marked by serial killers, another emergent threat during this time was mass shootings, exemplified by the tragic incident at a post office in Edmond, Oklahoma, in 1986. Patrick Sherrill's attack resulted in fourteen deaths and highlighted that such incidents weren't isolated, as evidenced by multiple mass shootings between 1983 and 1993. This growing phenomenon began to capture media attention but wasn't fully understood until later.


The passage discusses the evolution and impact of mass shootings in the United States from the 1980s to the present, particularly focusing on how societal contexts influenced these tragic events.

### Economic Context and Workplace Shootings
- **Economic Pressures**: During the Reagan era, public sector workers faced increasing pressures due to economic policies that included deregulation and privatization. The postal service, for instance, was subjected to significant changes, leading to heightened stress among employees.
- **Workplace Shootings as Indicators of Stress**: Workplace shootings were often framed by society as indicators of a breakdown in social order or family values. However, the underlying causes were more related to economic stresses and deteriorating working conditions. 
  - **Example**: The 1989 shooting at Standard Gravure in Louisville is highlighted as an instance where extreme workplace pressures, including health hazards, wage cuts, pension fund issues, and job insecurity due to union-busting strategies, led a worker named Joseph "Rocky" Wesbecker to commit murder.

### Transition from Workplace to School Shootings
- **School Shootings Emergence**: In the 1980s, mass shootings in schools were rare. The shooting by Brenda Ann Spencer in San Diego in 1979 was an early example and became culturally significant due to her statement about disliking Mondays.
- **Columbine as a Turning Point**: The Columbine High School massacre in 1999 marked a shift towards school-related mass shootings becoming more prevalent in the United States. Since then, numerous students have experienced such incidents.

### Cultural Impact and Policy Response
- **Cultural Symbols**: Both "going postal" and Spencer’s infamous remark became cultural touchstones reflecting societal concerns about violence.
- **Legislative Changes**: The 1989 École Polytechnique massacre in Canada prompted significant changes to gun laws, symbolizing a broader recognition of the need for policy responses to mass shootings.

### Ongoing Issues
- **Mass Shootings as Cultural and Political Symbols**: In the U.S., mass shooters have increasingly targeted not just workplaces and schools but also places of worship and public events. These incidents are deeply intertwined with cultural debates over gun control, political ideology, and societal values.
- **Continued Trauma**: The cumulative effect of these shootings on American society is profound, contributing to ongoing trauma and a contentious national dialogue about how best to address such violence.

Overall, the passage illustrates that while mass shootings have occurred in various contexts throughout history, they are deeply rooted in specific economic, cultural, and political dynamics. Understanding these factors is crucial for addressing and potentially mitigating future incidents.


The passage discusses how mass shootings have become a focal point for conspiracy theories, particularly among groups that label such events as "false flag" operations involving actors posing as victims. Additionally, it highlights how families who have lost children to these tragedies are often targeted by extremist right-wing platforms.

The narrative underscores the significant increase in mass shooting incidents over time, pointing out that while there were only seven recorded cases in 2001, this number had escalated dramatically to 627 by 2023, indicating a yearly rise. This trend is seen as indicative of problematic issues surrounding gun culture in America.

Furthermore, the text identifies concerning patterns linked to online platforms fostering racist and sexist ideologies. Websites like 8chan have played roles in glorifying perpetrators of mass violence. Specific incidents are mentioned: the El Paso Walmart shooter, who used 8chan to share his manifesto; the Christchurch mosque shooter, whose video was widely circulated on Facebook; and Marc Lépine, a Canadian mass killer celebrated by certain male misogynist groups.

Despite Canada's stricter gun laws compared to the United States, it has also experienced severe mass killings. The passage suggests that across North America and Europe, these acts are often associated with so-called modern "folk devils" like incels (involuntary celibates), lone wolves, and white nationalists. These terms serve as euphemisms pointing towards a deeper issue: the rageful misogynistic attitudes predominantly held by some men.

Overall, the passage highlights the complex interplay between societal issues related to gun laws, online radicalization, and gender-based animosity contributing to the alarming rise in mass shootings.
