In Chapter 26, titled "A NEW DECADE," the narrator reflects on significant changes in their life and the challenges associated with living according to alternative social values. The chapter begins by describing the closure of Angelus House in May 1990. Brit, the narrator's partner, gave birth to their second daughter, Siobhan, at this time. Feeling that it was the right moment for a new start, they moved north to Cobalt, Ontario, leaving behind their life as part of a Catholic Worker house.

The decision to leave was partly influenced by the couple's desire for more privacy and simplicity. Brit, in particular, felt uncomfortable with the public nature of their life at Angelus House, where personal boundaries were often blurred. The narrator, an extrovert, began questioning whether they could continue thriving within what they perceived as a distorted social dynamic that did not fully embrace or understand their mission.

When Angelus House first opened, the narrator aimed to demonstrate that living outside the dominant economic paradigm was possible and essential for creating a fairer society. They accepted invitations to speak publicly, hoping to inspire others to contribute to this vision. However, they found that people were more interested in hearing from young "saints" who lived among the poor rather than engaging with their ideas about systemic change.

A recurring issue during these public engagements was the expectation for charitable donations. While such contributions—food, clothing, and money—were sometimes helpful, they often felt like an imposition. The narrator grew uncomfortable accepting hand-me-down items that did not meet the actual needs of those living at Angelus House. This discomfort intensified as right-wing ideologies gained traction, advocating for reduced state support for the underprivileged and promoting volunteerism and charity as replacements.

The narrator expressed a specific incident involving refusal to accept unwanted donations, illustrating their frustration with being seen as part of President George H.W. Bush's "thousand points of light" initiative—a metaphor for volunteer efforts supposedly filling in gaps left by the government. This chapter concludes by noting that moving to Cobalt, a small former mining town, seemed an unlikely place for the couple’s next chapter but suggested it was a strategic choice aligned with their need for change and a simpler life.

The passage presents a reflection on the climate crisis, societal changes, and global events over recent decades, culminating in the upheavals of 2020. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Climate Crisis as an Immediate Threat**: The writer describes their current environment—smelling smoke from burning forests—as symbolic of the broader planetary emergency. The planet is facing unprecedented wildfires and other ecological disruptions due to climate change. Politicians are largely unresponsive or ineffective in addressing these issues, focusing instead on "adaptation" rather than prevention.

2. **Historical Context**: The climate crisis is depicted as a result of decades of excess consumption, poor leadership, and corporate influence, particularly from industries like Big Oil. It's portrayed as an ever-present threat that has grown increasingly tangible over time, contrary to earlier hopes it might remain distant.

3. **Societal Changes in the Late 20th Century**: The writer reflects on cultural shifts starting in the 1980s, which marked a departure from previous eras. This period saw rapid technological advances and consumerism, characterized by disposable goods and constant pursuit of new technology. These changes were driven by globalization and an increasing focus on convenience.

4. **Technological Obsession and Consumerism**: The narrative highlights how society became enamored with the latest technologies, which began to replace human skills like memory for phone numbers or directions. This obsession provided temporary distractions from deeper anxieties about financial instability and job insecurity.

5. **The Illusion of Normalcy**: Despite a sense that something was fundamentally unsustainable about this way of life ("Good for a year. Good for a couple of washes"), society continued in its pattern of excess until the early 2020s.

6. **Pandemic as a Turning Point**: The COVID-19 pandemic is described as a critical event, similar to the fall of the Berlin Wall, marking an abrupt end to the "fever dream" of relentless consumerism and globalization. Initially perceived as a pause in everyday life, it soon revealed that there was no return to the previous normal.

7. **Reflection on Reality**: The passage concludes with an acknowledgment that while this reality felt like the norm, everyone subconsciously knew it wasn't sustainable. The pandemic exposed these underlying truths, forcing society to confront the need for significant change.

Overall, the piece is a poignant reflection on how historical and cultural developments have led to current environmental and societal challenges, emphasizing the urgency of confronting these issues head-on.


The text reflects on recent global events—such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and crises in Gaza—as well as environmental challenges like wildfires and climate chaos. These issues underscore the illusion of stability that characterized the period from the late 1980s to early 2020s, suggesting it was an abnormal time when significant problems were ignored or inadequately addressed.

The author argues that humanity now stands at a crossroads and must decide how to move forward in this uncertain future. The lessons learned during the 1980s are highlighted as potentially valuable for guiding current efforts toward change. The author recalls believing, as an eighteen-year-old, in the power of collective action to achieve significant societal changes—like stopping nuclear threats or dismantling apartheid—through boycotts and protests.

There's a call to draw hope from contemporary movements like student climate strikes and Indigenous youth protests. These actions, often dismissed by some as insignificant, are portrayed as seeds for transformation. Bruce Walsh, an activist from the AIDS crisis era, emphasizes that change is possible when people become empowered, highlighting the importance of persistence and participation in creating opportunities for luck and success.

The notion of "luck" is presented not as a mere chance but as something achievable through active engagement and effort. When movements build solidarity and confront formidable challenges, there are moments when these barriers can be overcome if people are prepared to seize them.

In essence, the text encourages young generations facing climate change and economic instability to actively participate in societal change efforts. It argues that while luck might play a role, the real power lies in collective action and determination to try, as inaction is far more detrimental than any perceived failures in trying. This perspective motivates young workers across North America who are resisting these challenges.


The passage reflects on current social movements, challenges, and opportunities within the context of global activism and change. It underscores several key themes:

These actions are portrayed as courageous responses to a system that has been entrenched for four decades. The quote from activist Sam Gindin emphasizes the risks these workers take and suggests there is a growing collective spirit or "zeitgeist" driving people toward confronting corporate power.

2. **Environmental and Social Advocacy**: Maude Barlow highlights positive developments in environmental advocacy, noting increased recognition of biodiversity needs at governmental levels. She introduces the concept of "wise hope," which involves acknowledging reality, learning about crises, and taking informed action, rather than succumbing to false optimism.

3. **Challenges from Misinformation and Extremism**: The passage also acknowledges significant challenges such as the spread of disinformation, political extremism, antisemitism, and transphobia. These forces threaten democracy and complicate efforts toward positive change.

4. **Importance of Memory in Activism**: The text draws on Rebecca Solnit's idea that memory is crucial for challenging the perception of an unchangeable status quo. By remembering past victories over malignant forces, individuals are reminded that transformative choices are possible. Solnit’s metaphor of "branches as hope" and "roots as memory" encapsulates this sentiment.

5. **Literary Reflections**: Joe Strummer's assertion, “The future is unwritten,” serves to emphasize the potential for change and choice in shaping the future, despite current uncertainties.

6. **Personal Experiences and Inspiration**: The author reflects on personal experiences at Angelus House, where hope and transformation often came from unexpected sources. These reflections are tied to a motivational quote from Dorothy Day that encourages perseverance in activism.
