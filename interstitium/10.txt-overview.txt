In Chapter 10 of this narrative, the author reflects on a significant moment that occurred at The Cabana Room—a venue in Toronto known for its 1940s-style ambiance and vibrant live music scene. This chapter centers around an encounter with Brit Griffin (Lauren Bacall) during a gig on August 20, 1982.

The Cabana Room was managed by bartender Jimmy Scopas, who had a straightforward approach to booking bands: they needed to promote effectively and ensure good attendance, which translated into beer sales. The author's band was popular among young audiences at the venue, including underage fans, but their gigs were trouble-free due to generally good behavior.

On this particular night, Brit Griffin, an Edmonton native studying postgraduate university work, attended the gig introduced by Michael Glassbourg, a writer involved with Rock Against Racism (RAR). This movement aimed to use music as a platform against racism, and Brit had come to see how bands contributed to this cause in Toronto.

During a break at the performance, Brit approached the author. Her appearance was distinct from typical punk fans of that time—she had long red hair, wore no makeup, and dressed differently. When she mentioned her nickname "Brit," it became clear her real name was Lauren, given by her mother after actress Lauren Bacall.

Their conversation highlighted an unexpected depth in Brit's interest; rather than focusing solely on the music, she wanted to understand the social messages conveyed through the author's lyrics. This interaction marked a pivotal moment for the author, as it led to a deeper personal connection beyond music, setting the stage for significant life changes.

Overall, this chapter captures a turning point initiated by an encounter with Brit, blending themes of music, politics, and personal transformation in the context of Toronto’s vibrant cultural scene during the early 1980s.


The passage recounts the narrator's journey into activism and personal growth, influenced by strong feminist politics through his involvement with a Woman Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW) collective in Alberta. His exposure to issues of sexual violence at a rape crisis center and during workshops in Fort MacMurray was transformative, leading him to join forces with Brit, a committed activist. Together they shared a close bond, quickly moving in together within two months on Halloween 1982.

Financially constrained, the narrator worked as a dishwasher and played bass guitar, while Brit earned money cleaning houses as she completed her master's degree in philosophy of education. Despite their modest means, they managed to secure an apartment downtown. They both shared a restlessness with conventional paths; Brit had no interest in teaching despite her qualifications, while the narrator sought more than the punk ethos of protest he was drawn to.

The narrator’s quest for meaningful action led him to explore liberation theology through influential thinkers like Thomas Merton, Søren Kierkegaard, and Leonardo Boff. However, contemplative practices such as visiting a Trappist monastery proved unsatisfying due to his preference for active engagement over silent reflection.

A pivotal moment came when Brit challenged the narrator to move beyond abstract musings about global injustices by asking him what he actually wanted to do. This prompted them to consider how they could actively contribute to positive change, leading the narrator to suggest volunteering overseas as a potential avenue for making a difference. This conversation marked a turning point in their relationship and set them on a path toward finding practical ways to enact social change.


The passage explores themes of social activism, community building, and personal growth through the experiences of two individuals, one identified as "I" who is part of a band called L’étranger, and Brit. The story begins with them contemplating starting an intentional community to live among like-minded people focused on questions of faith and making the world better. They place notices at their university and St. Michael’s Cathedral but receive no interest except from someone uncomfortable with their unmarried status.

As life progresses, the narrator continues touring with L’étranger while Brit focuses on her studies. Despite gaining attention for the band's music, which addresses social issues, the narrator feels a sense of guilt and questions whether they should be doing more to enact change. This leads them to purchase an autobiography about Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement.

Dorothy Day is introduced as a pivotal figure in North American Catholicism known for her work in establishing houses for the homeless that also served as centers for social activism. Her philosophy emphasized grassroots rebuilding and living among those they aimed to help. The narrator becomes inspired by reading about Day’s commitment, which included facing arrest multiple times for causes such as supporting farm workers’ strikes.

A highlighted photograph of Dorothy Day from 1973 shows her on a picket line in California, confronting police with determination despite the risk of arrest—a frequent occurrence throughout her life due to her activism. Her early encounters with law enforcement were harsh, starting with an arrest at nineteen for suffragette activities and later experiences involving mistreatment by Chicago police.

The narrative reflects the narrator's journey from contemplating dramatic change to being inspired by Dorothy Day’s example of active social engagement and personal sacrifice. This inspiration leads them to consider a deeper commitment to activism, though initially, their understanding is limited to just a few chapters of Day's autobiography.


**Summary and Explanation:**

Dorothy Day was a prominent American activist with a revolutionary background in radical politics, including her involvement with groups like the Wobblies, anarchists, and communists. Despite having no religious upbringing, she developed an interest in Catholicism through observing her immigrant neighbors' practices.

The birth of her daughter Tamar in 1926 prompted Day to seek baptism for her child, leading her toward a more formal association with the Catholic Church. This decision distanced her from her leftist peers but also did not align her fully with mainstream Catholic views. During the Great Depression and rising fascism in Europe, she criticized how religious institutions often blamed the poor for their plight rather than addressing the systemic causes of poverty.

As a journalist and social revolutionary, Day founded "The Catholic Worker" newspaper on May 1, 1933, to address these issues by advocating economic justice and non-violence. Her inaugural editorial was straightforward, reaching out to those suffering from unemployment and hopelessness during that period. The paper called for radical change in the social order, challenging both state and Church authorities.

The publication quickly gained popularity, with circulation reaching 100,000 copies per month. Notably, it inspired many homeless individuals to seek assistance directly from Day's office. In response, she established temporary housing and eventually a soup kitchen, advocating through her newspaper for others to create similar "Houses of Hospitality" across the nation.

Dorothy Day embraced an anarchist ethic, encouraging direct action and community-based solutions rather than relying on institutionalized aid. Her efforts led to the establishment of multiple Catholic Worker houses throughout the United States, providing immediate support while promoting broader social change. Her legacy intertwines radical activism with deep religious conviction, advocating for systemic transformation through grassroots engagement.


The passage you provided explores how Dorothy Day's philosophy of social activism, rooted in both religious mysticism and anarchist principles like mutual aid, inspired a new generation of activists to engage with marginalized communities. Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **Dorothy Day’s Influence**: Dorothy Day was known for promoting social justice within the framework of Catholicism. She encouraged young people to actively participate in "works of mercy" such as feeding the hungry and helping the homeless, invoking the idea that youth should engage in "heroic" actions. Day integrated anarchist philosophies like mutual aid into her religious teachings, suggesting that true divinity is seen in serving those who are poor and needy. This was aligned with Peter Kropotkin’s view of cooperation as a driving force for evolutionary progress rather than competition.

2. **Personal Impact**: The author recounts how deeply moved they were by Day's approach, leading them to explore the concept of Houses of Hospitality—communal living spaces that provided refuge and support for marginalized individuals without treating them like cases to be managed but as friends to live with. This philosophy had been a catalyst for many activists, including notable figures such as author James W. Douglass and singer Utah Phillips.

3. **Initiative in Toronto**: At the time, Brit and the narrator were unaware of the full extent of social issues affecting marginalized groups in Toronto—issues like addiction, homelessness, prison system challenges, and domestic abuse. Despite this lack of knowledge, they decided to take inspiration from Day’s model and open their own Catholic Worker house rather than volunteering at an established one. Their approach was unconventional for its time; it combined the rebellious spirit of punk rock with the charitable mission of the Catholic Workers.

4. **The Symbolism**: The narrative concludes by drawing a metaphor between forming a band (a symbol of creativity and rebellion) and creating their own space for social action, emphasizing that this blend of radical activism and spiritual charity was both characteristic of the era and indicative of broader cultural trends.

Overall, this passage captures a moment in time where traditional religious values were merged with radical activism to address pressing societal issues through grassroots efforts.
