**Chapter 16: The Means of Production**

This chapter describes the communal lifestyle at Angelus House, focusing on how the residents used their space as a hub for social interaction and progressive planning. A large dining room table served dual purposes: it was the gathering spot for evening meals and during the day, acted as a strategic center where people discussed various ideas aimed at changing society.

Residents included Catholic idealists, anarchists, and those simply intrigued by this unconventional neighborhood. The house embodied an experiment in alternative living, with collective financial decisions such as withdrawing money from traditional banks to invest in local alternatives like the Bread and Roses Credit Union. They also procured food in bulk from a co-operative warehouse and explored barter systems through LETS (Local Exchange Trading System).

A significant ambition for Brit and the narrator was to establish a newspaper promoting social justice, simpler living, and support for the poor. Despite lacking journalistic training, they aspired to produce a professional publication.

Central to their discussions around the dining table was whether to adopt new technology like home computers, exemplified by emerging models such as the Commodore 64 and Atari. This period marked the early stages of a digital revolution, yet skepticism about technology's impact on life persisted. The reference to Thomas Pynchon’s 1984 essay highlighted this ambivalence, questioning the appropriateness of resisting technological progress.

The term "Luddite" is explored in its historical context versus modern interpretation. Historically, Luddites were not anti-technology but resisted technologies that threatened their livelihoods and economic independence within a capitalist framework. This contrasts with contemporary views where Luddites are often seen as those resistant to any form of progress.

In the 1980s, desktop computers were primarily viewed as tools for gaming or simple office tasks rather than transformative devices. The chapter underscores how this perception underestimated the profound impact these machines would eventually have on global economies, communication systems, and interpersonal relationships.

The text provides a historical perspective on the early days of digital communication, focusing on the emergence of Bulletin Boards and their role in information sharing through computer networks over phone lines. These platforms hosted chat rooms where users could exchange ideas and content. An individual highlighted this potential for revolutionizing communication, suggesting that "content" would become crucial in the digital age.

At first glance, there was skepticism about the transformative power of such technology. The narrative points out notable figures like a newspaper editor who initially missed the broader implications of these developments, as did tech pioneer Bill Gates, who underestimated the internet's potential until he saw the success of Netscape Navigator.

The passage reflects on four decades into the digital revolution and emphasizes how difficult it is to fully understand its long-term impacts. Initially, the digital age seemed like a promising means for empowerment and global communication. Early proponents, such as Jaron Lanier, celebrated the web's potential for human cooperation and positive outcomes based on inherent goodness.

The excitement of using new technology—surfing the web and utilizing gadgets—was seen as inherently progressive. Clay Shirky is mentioned, advocating an optimistic view that changes in communication tools fundamentally reshape society, likening technological advancements to natural structures like hives.

However, a more critical perspective highlights significant downsides, particularly related to the production of these technologies. The reality reveals vast inequalities and exploitation within global supply chains. For instance, the passage references distressing reports from 2017 about poor working conditions at an iPhone factory in China, where workers faced severe stress and low wages, leading to tragic outcomes.

In summary, while the digital revolution initially promised empowerment and progress, it has also revealed profound issues tied to corporate power, labor exploitation, and inequality. The narrative suggests a need for deeper reflection on how technology affects both society and individual lives beyond its initial idealistic promises.


The passage provides a critical examination of Silicon Valley's role in shaping modern society through technology, highlighting its historical anti-union stance and early adoption of offshoring practices. It traces the evolution of Silicon Valley culture into the 1980s, marked by libertarian capitalism aligned with Reagan-era policies. The tech giants saw themselves as having both the right and duty to reshape democracy and societal norms.

A key point is the irony in how Apple's 1984 advertisement, which championed individuality against conformity and surveillance, contrasted starkly with the actual practices of Silicon Valley. In reality, these companies created systems that deeply track user behavior, effectively turning users into components of a larger exploitative system encompassing everything from Congolese miners to Chinese factory workers.

Shoshana Zuboff's concept of "surveillance capitalism" is introduced, emphasizing how digital platforms like Facebook and YouTube have prioritized behavioral modification over traditional production means. This manipulation often manifests as digital addiction, with algorithms designed to keep users engaged through content that elicits strong emotional responses such as anger or fear. The consequences include increased societal issues like alienation, anxiety, tribalism, political violence, and even genocide.

The rise of authoritarian figures like Donald Trump, Brexit, and Jair Bolsonaro is linked to these digital practices. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie's 2018 revelations about privacy breaches enabling far-right groups to manipulate online discourse underscore the fragility of democratic processes in this context.

Additionally, Sean Parker's candid admission about Facebook/Meta’s design exploiting human psychology reveals a deliberate and reckless disregard for ethical considerations. This exploitation has had severe real-world impacts, such as facilitating ethnic violence in Myanmar, underscoring that these issues were embedded in the digital revolution from its inception. The passage concludes by reflecting on how Silicon Valley's ambitions have led to significant societal disruptions, rooted in a foundational disregard for privacy and ethical standards.
