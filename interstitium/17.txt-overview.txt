The passage describes a period in the mid-1980s when significant political and social events unfolded regarding refugee policy changes in Canada, activism against corporate malpractice, and individual stories of seeking asylum. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Canadian Refugee Policy Changes**: 
   - During this time, individuals were gathering near Canadian border towns like Buffalo, seeking refuge north of the U.S. border due to difficult conditions elsewhere.
   - The Mulroney government in Canada initially aligned its refugee policies with those of the Reagan administration in the United States. However, extensive grassroots activism and solidarity efforts pressured the government to amend these policies, allowing more refugees to stay rather than being sent back.

2. **Grassroots Activism**:
   - Organizations such as the Jesuit Centre for Social Justice and Faith in Toronto played a crucial role by supporting refugee causes.
   - Brit, an employee at this organization, traveled with a Jesuit group to Chiapas, Mexico, to meet refugees living in camps there.

3. **Brit's Experience in Chiapas**:
   - In 1987, she shared her observations from the trip, noting interactions with local communities and hearing their stories of hardship.
   - The visit was organized by Enrique Torres, a labor lawyer who fled Guatemala after receiving death threats for defending workers' rights against Coca-Cola.

4. **Coca-Cola Union Struggle in Guatemala**:
   - In Guatemala City, union leaders faced severe repercussions for advocating for workers at the Coca-Cola bottling plant.
   - The threat of plant closure led to an occupation by workers and a prolonged thirteen-month siege.
   - This conflict garnered international attention, leading to boycotts (known as "Killer Coke") that pressured Coca-Cola into negotiations, resulting in a victory for the workers.

5. **Personal Narrative**:
   - The story also includes Jorge's arrival at Angelus House after deserting the Guatemalan army, seeking safety due to the dangerous political climate.
   - Brit and her husband planned a personal retreat during this intense period but remained involved in broader social justice efforts.

This passage captures a snapshot of activism, international labor struggles, and individual journeys for safety amid geopolitical tensions.


In this detailed account, Brit and the narrator experienced a distressing incident during their absence while on a romantic getaway. The situation unfolded as follows:

1. **Initial Situation**: Julie, a 20-year-old volunteer responsible for overseeing the house while they were away, called with alarming news. Jorge, an individual associated with the solidarity group that had sent him to stay at the house, returned home heavily intoxicated and violent. His aggressive behavior caused fear among the residents, likening their situation to being held hostage.

2. **Response**: Julie managed to prevent further escalation by locking the doors after two men tried to take Jorge out, presumably to calm him down. Upon returning home, Brit and the narrator found the atmosphere tense and immediately contacted their solidarity group, only to receive inadequate support.

3. **Confrontation**: Later that night, when Jorge attempted to enter the house while still under the influence, a confrontation ensued. He threw a beer bottle at the narrator but failed to break in due to the robustness of the door.

4. **Police Involvement**: Brit quickly contacted the police, who arrived and dealt with Jorge aggressively. Although they intended to arrest him, they released him due to insufficient grounds for detention despite his threatening behavior.

5. **Aftermath**: The narrator felt vulnerable after the police left, prompting a call back for additional information about Jorge. The officer reassured that if Jorge returned, they would be contacted again, leaving Brit and the narrator uncertain about their safety.

6. **Prayer Card Solution**: In desperation, Brit remembered an old prayer card with a prayer to St. Michael intended to ward off evil. They decided to use it as a protective measure against further incidents involving Jorge.

This narrative underscores themes of community responsibility, inadequate institutional support for handling violent behavior, and the psychological impact on those involved. The decision to employ spiritual or symbolic protection highlights the emotional toll and uncertainty faced by Brit and the narrator in managing such unpredictable situations.


The text you've provided intertwines personal experiences with broader historical and socio-political contexts involving violence, displacement, and political instability in Central America.

### Personal Experience:
- The narrative begins with an account of a couple who faced threats from local criminals. They sought protection from a motorcycle gang, which they declined. With no viable alternatives, they resorted to using holy water and prayers for safety as suggested by a prayer card.
- During one night, the narrator wakes up to see Jorge, presumably someone associated with their previous troubles, standing at the edge of their property without entering it. This sighting leaves them on edge for the rest of the day.

### Broader Context:
1. **Murder of Lawyer Enrique Torres (2012):**
   - Enrique Torres was a lawyer in Guatemala known for defending workers' rights and marginalized people. His murder is attributed to his activism, highlighting the dangers faced by those opposing powerful interests in Guatemala.

2. **Ríos Montt's Conviction and Acquittal:**
   - In 2013, General Efraín Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity but was later acquitted due to pressure from Guatemalan elites. This case underscores the challenges in achieving justice for historical atrocities.

3. **Guatemalan Refugees and U.S. Policies (2018):**
   - The narrative moves to 2018, when a Trump administration policy led to increased scrutiny of Central American migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many were fleeing from violence exacerbated by gangs and drug cartels—a legacy of instability post-genocide.
   - Reports indicate significant psychological trauma among children separated from their families during these migrations.

4. **Enduring Impact:**
   - Over 500 children remained disconnected from their families three years after being detained, reflecting the long-term human cost of such policies.
   - The violence and terror faced by refugees today can be traced back to military tactics from past conflicts in Central America.

### Reflection:
- The narrator reflects on their initial ignorance about the depth and implications of Jorge's presence, linking it metaphorically to a lack of understanding of the larger geopolitical issues at play. This suggests an awakening to the complexities and ongoing repercussions of historical violence and political power struggles in Latin America.

Overall, this narrative highlights how individual fears can mirror broader societal challenges and injustices, illustrating the intersection between personal experiences and systemic issues.


The passage reflects on the challenges faced when providing aid and accommodation to refugees, particularly emphasizing the lack of understanding about the severe impacts of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dislocation, and mass violence. The author recognizes that, with hindsight, they would have sought more comprehensive information about a refugee named Jorge before he stayed in their home and would have endeavored to establish necessary support systems to address his cultural, linguistic, and traumatic experiences.

The responsibility of aiding refugees often falls on individual families, community groups, churches, and mosques. Many of these entities operate with minimal resources or formal support, relying heavily on the goodwill and bravery of volunteers who are willing to take risks to provide refuge to those escaping violent conflicts or disasters. The passage underscores that without such volunteer efforts, many displaced individuals would have little hope for safety and a new life.

In recent decades, the world has seen significant forced migrations due to violence and climate-related disasters in regions like Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, and Sudan. As of 2022, the United Nations reported over one billion people as displaced globally, highlighting an immense level of human suffering. Many refugees endure complex physical and psychological traumas, often resulting in PTSD.

The passage calls for increased support to address both emotional and physical damages experienced by those fleeing violence. However, it also acknowledges a grim reality: many displaced individuals fail to reach safety entirely. This underscores the need not only for more robust volunteer networks but also for systemic support structures that can better handle the scale of current humanitarian crises.
