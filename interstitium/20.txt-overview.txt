**Chapter 20: Fire on Babylon**

This chapter describes an eventful Tuesday night at Angelus House, which hosted an open Mass followed by a communal dinner. The gathering was informal but meaningful, with attendees reflecting on scripture and sharing thoughts without pressure to participate.

A key figure introduced is Martin Royackers, a young Jesuit priest who left a lasting impression due to his confrontational nature and critical view of authority. Initially met with skepticism, he eventually garnered respect for his work in Jamaica, where he advocated for displaced parishioners' rights to land. His activism, however, led to threats against him, culminating in his assassination by hired gunmen in 2001.

The author reflects on the trust placed in priests like Royackers who seemed genuine and relatable, often mingling with locals in casual settings. This trust obscured a pattern of darker behaviors that some clergy exhibited beneath their religious roles.

A pivotal moment arises when the author is approached by a priest from the Southdown Institute, a Church-run facility for clergy grappling with personal issues such as alcoholism and depression. The institute aims to help these individuals reintegrate into pastoral duties. Eager to assist, the author agrees to welcome Southdown patients to their Mass.

The first visitor from Southdown was described as a tall, thin priest with a distinctive Louisiana accent. His visit left an impression when he withdrew momentarily during the evening, reflecting on something while looking out of the window. This encounter sets the stage for further developments related to trust and hidden issues within clergy life.


The passage describes an unfolding crisis within the Catholic Church in Louisiana during the 1980s related to widespread sexual abuse by priests. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

### Context and Initial Incident
- **Scene Setting**: The narrator is at Southdown, where they encounter a priest mentioning his "problem with celibacy." At the time, this is not understood as an admission of child sexual abuse.
- **Lack of Awareness**: The author was unaware that Southdown was used to treat priests involved in hiding from a significant sexual abuse scandal.

### The Louisiana Crisis
- **Initiation**: The crisis began in 1983 when Father Gilbert Gauthe was summoned by Monsignor Alex Larroque. Gauthe had been sexually abusing children since the early 1970s.
- **Church Response**: Instead of reporting Gauthe to law enforcement, the Church's response was to cover up the abuse to protect its reputation. The standard practice involved relocating priests and using legal and moral pressure to ensure silence from victims' families.

### Systemic Issues
- **Cover-Up Practices**:
  - Priests accused of abuse were reassigned rather than prosecuted.
  - Parents threatening to involve police were often given assurances that the priest would receive treatment, resulting in temporary removal without further action.
- **Vatican Protocols**: In 1962, the Vatican established protocols making it difficult for victims to report abuse. Complaints had a strict thirty-day window, after which cases were dismissed, and excommunication threatened if they persisted.

### Impact on Victims
- **Pressure Tactics**: Families of victims faced immense pressure from Church authorities to remain silent.
- **Use of Excommunication**: The threat of being excommunicated—a severe spiritual sanction—was used as a tool to enforce compliance with the cover-up.

This passage highlights the systemic nature of abuse and cover-up within the Catholic Church, emphasizing how institutional practices were designed to protect clergy at the expense of justice for victims.


The passage outlines a series of deeply troubling events related to systemic sexual abuse within various Catholic dioceses across North America, primarily focusing on incidents that occurred from the 1980s onward.

### Key Points:

1. **Gauthe Case in Louisiana**: The text begins with the Gauthe case in Louisiana where a priest was indicted for sexually assaulting as many as one hundred boys. This incident prompted other families to come forward, leading to more revelations about abusive priests being protected by church officials who relocated them to prevent exposure.

2. **Wider Abuses Across States**:
   - **New Mexico**: Father David Holley received a 275-year prison sentence for repeated abuse.
   - **Brooklyn and Florida**: Reverend William Autenrieth was charged with serial sexual abuse, indicating patterns of movement by church officials to cover up these crimes.

3. **Boston Archdiocese Scandal**:
   - The Boston archdiocese experienced significant fallout when it was revealed that Father James Porter had assaulted around 100 children and another priest, John Geoghan, abused approximately 130 children.
   - Church officials attempted to conceal these abuses by paying hush money and transferring the accused priests. An investigation by the Boston Globe uncovered a broader pattern of cover-ups affecting at least seventy other sexual predators.

4. **Legal Strategies and Fallout**:
   - The archdiocese adopted an aggressive legal stance, countersuing victim families and discrediting survivors in court, which was seen as a deterrent to others coming forward.
   - Ultimately, the Church's efforts failed; Cardinal Bernard Law resigned amid impending indictment and sought refuge at the Vatican. Despite this scandal, he later participated prominently in Pope John Paul II's funeral.

5. **Canada’s Involvement**:
   - The abuse scandal reached Canada with the 1989 investigation into the Mount Cashel orphanage in Newfoundland, indicating that these abuses were not confined to the United States but occurred across North America.

### Implications:

The passage illustrates a pattern of systemic abuse within the Catholic Church where church officials often protected abusers and attempted to suppress information. This cover-up strategy involved legal maneuvers and relocation of priests to avoid accountability. The widespread media coverage eventually forced the church to confront these issues, though initial responses often exacerbated the damage through legal aggression rather than transparency and restitution.

### Conclusion:

The abuse scandals had a profound impact on public trust in religious institutions and highlighted serious failures within the church's leadership regarding moral responsibility and justice for victims. These revelations led to significant organizational changes but also revealed deep-seated issues of institutional complicity in concealing such crimes.


The text outlines systemic issues involving sexual abuse in Canadian Catholic-run residential schools, focusing on institutional cover-ups by clergy, police, and public officials. The narrative begins with high-profile cases such as Bishop Alphonsus Penney's resignation due to neglecting allegations against priests in Newfoundland, and Bishop Hubert O’Connor being criminally charged for sex crimes at a residential school in Prince George, BC.

In 1992, another significant investigation commenced when survivors of St. Anne’s Residential School in Fort Albany, Ontario, came forward with harrowing accounts of rape, forced abortions, and torture inflicted by religious personnel and staff. Over five years, the Ontario Provincial Police collected testimonies from nine hundred survivors, uncovering a century-long history of abuse shielded by Church and government officials.

The abuses at St. Anne’s mirrored those in Catholic institutions abroad, such as St. Ninian’s School in Scotland, with tactics including homemade electric chairs and forcing children to ingest vomit. The scandal at St. Anne’s became emblematic of widespread mistreatment within Canada's church-run residential schools, prompting a deluge of lawsuits against the federal government.

To avoid costly court proceedings, the Canadian government consented to establish the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a compensation process for survivors. In 2009, these survivors faced closed-door arbitration panels where they often lacked legal representation, while government lawyers also defended the federal government as co-defendants in the abuse cases.

A particularly egregious case involved Father Arthur Lavoie, who had perpetrated abuse over four decades at St. Anne’s. Despite evidence of his crimes, one survivor's case was dismissed because Justice Department lawyers withheld substantial evidence—over 10,000 pages concerning 180 abusers prepared by the police.

The survivors' quest for justice has been fraught with legal challenges and institutional resistance from both the Canadian government and the Catholic Church. The author reflects on their political efforts to uncover why Canada allowed these injustices to persist and the cover-up of survivor rights at St. Anne’s. This summary highlights systemic failures, legal hurdles, and ongoing struggles for accountability and reconciliation in addressing historical abuses within residential schools.


The text is a personal reflection on the author's complex relationship with organized religion, particularly the Catholic Church, and its impact on their political career and personal beliefs. The narrative begins by recounting an instance in 2018 when the author led efforts in Parliament to demand that the Pope issue an official apology from the Church for the crimes committed against Indigenous children in Canadian residential schools. This initiative was part of a broader call for accountability, highlighting the Catholic Church as the only Christian institution involved in these atrocities that resisted compensating survivors adequately.

This political challenge against the Catholic Church is not new for the author. Their first notable conflict occurred shortly after being elected to Parliament in 2004 when they voted in favor of same-sex marriage rights. This decision prompted the local Timmins diocese to threaten them with excommunication and defeat in the subsequent election if they did not reverse their stance. The threat failed, as the author received widespread support from their constituency, including many Catholic community members such as priests and nuns.

Despite overcoming this challenge, the experience led to a changed relationship with organized religion for the author. They recall feelings of anger over the betrayals by an institution they once trusted deeply. This sentiment is evoked through the reference to Sinéad O’Connor's song "Fire on Babylon," which critiques systemic abuse within the Church.

The author still experiences occasional moments of spiritual reflection, such as lighting a candle in a darkened church, suggesting that faith remains a part of their life despite its limitations. However, they argue that true faith should offer more than personal comfort; it should provide moral and spiritual leadership, especially crucial during contemporary challenges like climate change and economic inequality.

Reflecting on past religious leaders who courageously challenged systemic injustices, such as Dorothy Day and Desmond Tutu, the author laments a perceived lack of similar leadership today. They see this absence as a significant scandal and tragedy because faith should inspire resistance, healing, comfort, and hope in times of crisis. Ultimately, they believe that faith must remind us of our greater duties and the potential for miracles in an otherwise disheartening world.


The statement reflects a shift in perspective regarding where one finds hope and inspiration. Initially, the speaker found solace and encouragement within the confines of a church, suggesting that they previously associated religious spaces with signs of hope and positivity. This might imply a connection to spiritual or communal experiences often facilitated by such environments.

However, there's been a change in this viewpoint. The speaker now seeks hope outside these traditional settings, specifically among individuals they encounter who are actively working towards making positive changes in the world. This shift signifies an appreciation for tangible, real-world efforts and human actions that contribute to societal improvement. It emphasizes valuing direct impact over symbolic or institutional representations of hope.

This change may also reflect a broader understanding of spirituality and community as being not confined to specific places but rather embodied in everyday interactions and contributions. By focusing on people who are "doing their best," the speaker highlights the importance of personal agency, resilience, and the capacity for individuals to inspire and enact meaningful change regardless of the context.

Overall, this perspective underscores a belief that hope is dynamic and present in human actions and relationships, rather than being solely tied to traditional or institutional symbols. It celebrates everyday heroes and their efforts as sources of inspiration and optimism.
