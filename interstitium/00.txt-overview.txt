The passage reflects on the disorienting and challenging state of the world today, characterized by political instability, social fragmentation, environmental crises, and economic uncertainties. The author feels as though familiar patterns and certainties have been upended, leading to a sense of living in uncharted territory. This turmoil is attributed to various factors such as climate change (e.g., fire tornadoes), the COVID-19 pandemic, data-driven artificial intelligence's impact on human interaction, and what is described as "toxic capitalism."

The author notes that many people from Generation X and Boomers are looking back nostalgically at their younger years in the 1980s. This nostalgia often portrays the era as a simpler, more enjoyable time, exemplified by popular culture references like 'Stranger Things.' However, this rose-tinted view ignores the challenging realities of that decade, including political and corporate actions that undermined the American dream.

Media commentators have begun reevaluating the 1980s in light of current events. The author suggests that while there has been a continuous cultural influence from the 1980s, today's crises represent more than just an enduring cultural trend. Instead, they are the culmination of political, environmental, and economic forces set in motion during the 1980s.

Stephen Stoll's perspective is invoked to emphasize the importance of historical context for understanding contemporary issues. He likens ignoring history to overlooking a city’s ruins post-hurricane because people have lived there all along. The passage argues that the 1980s were akin to this hurricane, with its effects unfolding over decades and now manifesting in today's challenges.

Overall, the author calls for an examination of how the ideologies and policies from the 1980s—such as deregulation, globalization, and neoliberalism—have led to present-day crises. Understanding this historical trajectory is seen as crucial for making sense of current global dissonance and addressing these complex issues effectively.


The passage you provided delves into the socio-economic and environmental challenges faced by successive generations, particularly focusing on how neoliberal policies in the 1980s have contributed to current crises. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Contextual Backdrop**: The text highlights the negative impacts of capitalist speculators and petroleum-driven narratives that delayed addressing climate change. This context sets up an exploration into why such delays occurred, linking them to broader historical patterns.

2. **Confronting Historical Narratives**: It emphasizes the importance of reevaluating the history of the 1980s to understand present challenges. The narrative suggests that society often overlooks or forgets the socio-economic divides and contradictions of this era due to political manipulation—what is referred to as "historical amnesia." This selective memory is described as a deliberate strategy by those in power.

3. **Dangerous Memories**: The concept of "dangerous memories," introduced by theology professor Candace McLean, underscores these hidden histories that reveal resistance and hope for marginalized communities. These are the subversive narratives often suppressed because they challenge existing power structures.

4. **Generational Impact**: The book aims to share these repressed stories with younger generations who inherit a world marked by economic disparity, environmental degradation, and social inequities—outcomes attributed to policies favoring the ultra-wealthy. It emphasizes that the rise of billionaire oligarchs wasn't inevitable but was engineered through deliberate socio-economic manipulation.

5. **Historical Activism**: The text also reflects on how activism in the 1980s, such as protests against nuclear proliferation and apartheid, demonstrated significant societal solidarity and achieved notable victories across various social justice fronts, including environmental and LGBTQ rights movements.

6. **Reflection on Progress**: Despite these successes, the passage acknowledges that not all goals were achieved, questioning why an era of activism is retrospectively labeled as one of greed. This inquiry invites a reassessment of this complex period to learn from both its achievements and failures.

7. **Personal Narrative**: The author shares their personal journey beginning with punk rock in adolescence, which fostered a DIY ethos encouraging resistance against established norms. This personal narrative connects the broader socio-political themes with individual experiences of activism and personal growth.

8. **Call for Reevaluation**: Overall, the passage serves as both a critique of past socio-economic policies and an encouragement to learn from history's "dangerous memories" to better address contemporary challenges like climate change and social inequality.

In essence, this text advocates for a deeper understanding of historical events and their long-lasting impacts on society, urging current generations to draw lessons from the activism and struggles of the past to inform present and future actions.


The passage reflects on the personal experiences of an individual who was actively involved in feminist politics during the 1980s. This person and their partner, Brit, were inspired to challenge themselves to make a meaningful impact against perceived global injustices. Both were raised Catholic and were influenced by the Church's teachings at that time, which emphasized liberation and economic justice—a stark contrast to later scandals.

In an era characterized by greed, they chose to become "deliberate dropouts," opening their home as a sanctuary for marginalized groups like addicts, runaways, and the homeless. Their approach was inspired by anarchist principles of mutual aid and modeled after the Catholic Worker Movement initiated by Dorothy Day. Despite lacking experience and often being aided by peers equally inexperienced, the urgency of social issues fueled their efforts to create change.

The author later sought to reframe the history of the 1980s using personal memories as a lens. They questioned whether more could have been done during that time and pondered if it's possible to do more now, given today’s challenges. The goal is to reconnect with a younger self who believed in individual responsibility and change.

The text suggests that by revisiting these past experiences—termed "dangerous memories"—we can learn lessons of resistance and realize the power of collective action. This reflection isn't intended as a lament but as an inspiring call to arms, emphasizing that what was constructed can be deconstructed, and societal changes are achievable.

Ultimately, this narrative serves as a reminder that alternative futures were envisioned during the 1980s and that seeds for change planted then might still bear fruit today. The personal journey of the author underscores the idea that individual and collective actions have the power to influence society positively, advocating engagement and activism in response to contemporary issues.


In his book "Postcapitalism," Paul Mason argues that the primary objective of neoliberalism during the period from 1980 to 1984 was not primarily focused on free markets, fiscal discipline, sound money, privatization, offshoring, or even globalization. Instead, these elements served as instruments or consequences in pursuit of its main goal: dismantling organized labor's bargaining power.

Mason posits that neoliberalism fundamentally aimed to weaken the influence and negotiating capabilities of labor unions and worker organizations. By reducing the collective strength of workers, neoliberal policies sought to shift economic and political power towards capital owners and corporations. This shift allowed for greater control over wages, working conditions, and other employment terms by employers, ultimately benefiting those with capital at the expense of labor.

The weakening of organized labor was seen as essential for achieving broader neoliberal objectives such as deregulation, tax cuts for businesses, and reducing government intervention in markets—all of which were facilitated by diminished union power. By undermining unions, neoliberalism could more effectively implement policies that prioritized market efficiency and corporate profitability over workers' rights and social welfare.

In summary, Mason's analysis suggests that the erosion of labor's bargaining power was central to the neoliberal agenda, with other economic strategies serving as tools or outcomes in support of this primary aim. This perspective challenges conventional narratives that attribute neoliberalism solely to ideals like free markets or fiscal conservatism, highlighting instead its strategic focus on diminishing organized labor’s influence.
