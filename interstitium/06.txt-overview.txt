### Chapter 6: Rebel Music

**Context of White Supremacy in Canada**

In the 1980s, Toronto's Cabbagetown district became a global hub for white supremacist conspiracy theories, largely due to Ernst Zündel’s operations. Zündel ran a Holocaust-denial publishing house from this area, producing material that reached neo-Nazi groups worldwide. Efforts by Canadian authorities to shut down his business were unsuccessful. He used court trials as platforms to challenge the legitimacy of the Holocaust itself, effectively turning legal proceedings into spectacles and raising international concerns about Canada's ability to handle antisemitism.

**Far-Right Networks and Activities**

Zündel was not alone in promoting white supremacist ideologies. In 1981, Paul Fromm founded the Canadian Association of Free Expression to support the white power movement. Additionally, James McQuirter, a leading figure in the Ku Klux Klan in Canada, established an office in Toronto’s Riverdale neighborhood and actively recruited at local high schools. McQuirter was also implicated in a plot with neo-Nazi Wolfgang Droege and American mercenaries aiming to overthrow the government of Dominica.

McQuirter's 1981 arrest highlighted that extremist activities were not confined to a fringe group but represented a more significant threat within Canada.

**Multiculturalism vs. Racial Tensions**

The perception of Canada as a multicultural and tolerant society was challenged during this period. Toronto newspapers frequently reported violent hate crimes, especially against South Asians, while an NBC documentary described the city as a "time bomb" due to racial tensions. The documentary highlighted growing resentment among white residents amidst increasing racial diversity. Despite official policies promoting multiculturalism, these events suggested underlying societal racism.

**Police and Racial Tensions**

The 1970s and 1980s saw increased tension between Toronto’s predominantly white police force and its growing Black community. Police-involved shootings, such as the killing of Jamaican immigrant Albert Johnson in 1979, sparked significant unrest. Approximately two thousand Black residents protested against racial violence and discrimination. Mayor John Sewell's proposal for an independent board to address these issues was met with hostility from media outlets like the Toronto Sun and certain politicians who criticized him as being anti-police.

**Summary**

This chapter explores how white supremacist activities in Canada, particularly in Toronto during the 1980s, exposed deep-seated racial tensions. Despite a national narrative of multiculturalism, incidents of racism and violence were prevalent, challenging the notion of Canada as a tolerant society. These events also highlighted conflicts between marginalized communities and law enforcement, raising questions about societal inclusivity and justice.


The text provides an overview of the complex socio-political environment in Toronto during the early 1980s, particularly focusing on issues related to police-community relations and the punk music scene's engagement with these issues.

1. **"Cops Are Tops” Campaign**: This campaign included promotional materials like buttons, banners, and rallies that garnered significant support from white communities within the city. It highlights a period of tension between law enforcement and minority communities.

2. **Role of Cardinal Emmett G. Carter**: The local head of the Catholic Church was asked to address concerns raised by the Black community about police abuse. He discovered that the police were intimidating individuals who might speak out against them, emphasizing how dangerous it was for Black people to file formal complaints.

3. **Albert Johnson's Case**: Albert Johnson decided to lodge a complaint at the Ontario Human Rights Commission regarding harassment from the police. Tragically, four days after submitting this complaint, he was killed under suspicious circumstances in his home, witnessed by his young daughter. This incident catalyzed the Black music scene into action.

4. **Black Music Scene Response**: Artists like Lillian Allen and bands such as Truth and Rights used their platforms to critique systemic racism within the police force. The murder of Albert Johnson inspired various artists across different genres to create music addressing these issues, reflecting solidarity with the affected community.

5. **Punk Movement's Position**: Despite some punk groups showing support for Black communities, the movement was predominantly white and had diverse political leanings. While certain bands like Forgotten Rebels displayed reactionary attitudes, others actively opposed racist imagery. Steve Leckie, a prominent figure in Toronto's early punk scene, initially embraced Nazi symbols until confronted by Gene Simmons.

6. **Influence of UK Punk**: In Britain, the Oi! movement among skinheads was co-opted by far-right political groups like the National Front, which influenced some segments of the punk community towards more violent and extremist expressions. This shift led to increased aggression in punk-related events such as mosh pits.

7. **Policies Against Extremism**: In response to these troubling trends, some local bands and promoters established clear policies against racist symbols and ideologies. For example, they prohibited individuals wearing swastikas from attending shows.

Overall, the text highlights a period of cultural and political tension where music became a tool for activism and resistance against systemic racism, while also reflecting on the challenges faced by subcultures in maintaining progressive values amid emerging extremist influences.


In September 1981, during their first North American tour, the Dead Kennedys performed at L’étranger in Toronto. The event was organized by a local promoter who charged the band $75 for playing and also tasked them with creating and distributing posters. Upon arrival, it became apparent that no security had been arranged, which is unusual for punk shows but particularly concerning given the atmosphere.

The show drew a specific audience segment displaying Nazi symbols, attracted by provocative songs like “California Über Alles” and “Nazi Punks Fuck Off.” The performance began with enthusiastic cheers from most attendees, but soon tensions escalated. Instances of violence were noted as some individuals pushed around or attacked others in the crowd.

During their set, L’étranger expressed discontent with this segment of the audience, openly criticizing those sporting fascist symbols. This response led to chaos, with projectiles and spit thrown at the band. Despite these provocations, they maintained their performance and received support from their road crew, who attempted to manage aggressive attendees.

After their set, L’étranger confronted Dead Kennedys’ lead singer Jello Biafra in the dressing room, questioning why his band would allow Nazis at their show. Although surprised by the confrontation, Biafra addressed this issue during his performance, dedicating a song to those misappropriating Nazi symbols and condemning Nazism.

A witness, Marcy Rohn, noted that Dead Kennedys’ fans were not as progressive as expected, prompting her decision to stop taking photos due to safety concerns. This experience heightened L’étranger’s awareness of fascist elements within the punk scene and influenced their subsequent involvement with Rock Against Racism (RAR), a movement aimed at combating racism and fascism in music communities.

This event underscores the challenges faced by punk bands when confronting extremist ideologies, illustrating how cultural platforms like concerts can become arenas for ideological conflicts. It also highlights the role musicians play in addressing and resisting such elements within their scenes.


The text describes the formation and impact of Rock Against Racism (RAR) in Toronto during the early 1980s, drawing inspiration from its British counterpart which was motivated by the anti-racism manifesto written by David Widgery. The primary aim of RAR was to harness music as a tool for social change, fostering unity among diverse communities and combating racism.

### Context and Formation
- **Motivation:** In Toronto during the early 1980s, there were significant threats from racial extremism, notably the activities of the KKK. Nicholas Jennings, motivated by these threats, initiated RAR after witnessing its success in Britain where music groups like The Clash and Steel Pulse played pivotal roles.
- **Foundation:** RAR was launched with a foundational meeting attended by 150 people. It grew rapidly through grassroots efforts, utilizing music events at nightclubs, church basements, and large halls to spread their message.

### Activities and Impact
- **Cultural Crossover:** RAR facilitated collaboration between white punk bands and Black reggae artists, promoting an inclusive culture of unity. Notable local artists included Leroy Sibbles and Horace Faith.
- **Educational Initiatives:** The movement educated youth through its zine "Rebel Music" and multimedia shows in city high schools.
- **Political Engagement:** Speakers at RAR events raised awareness about broader social issues like apartheid, poverty, gender-based violence, and Indigenous rights. This activism was part of a larger trend where music was used to support various social movements.

### Broader Impact
- **Music as Activism:** Music significantly diminished the appeal of extremist ideologies among disaffected youth by fostering community and understanding.
- **Global Influence:** The period reflected broader political engagement within the music scene globally. Notably, in 1984, musicians like Bob Geldof and Midge Ure organized efforts to address global issues such as famine through projects like "Do They Know It’s Christmas" and Live Aid.

Overall, RAR in Toronto exemplified how music could be a powerful catalyst for social change, bridging cultural divides and mobilizing communities against racism. Through grassroots efforts and collaborations across racial lines, the movement made significant strides toward marginalizing extremist ideologies in the region.

The text you've provided delves into several interconnected themes: the role of a pioneering radio station in promoting independent music, the ethical considerations faced by artists, and broader social justice issues. Let's break it down:

### CFNY-FM and Independent Music

1. **CFNY-FM's Role**: The upstart radio station in Brampton, CFNY-FM, played a significant role in shaping commercial radio through its promotion of independent bands. DJs like Liz Janik and Peter Goodwin were instrumental in this effort.

2. **U-Knows Awards**: CFNY organized an alternate awards ceremony known as the U-Knows, which served as a counterpoint to the more corporate-focused Juno Awards in Canada. This highlighted a commitment to supporting independent artists over mainstream corporate interests.

3. **Ethical Dilemma**: In 1983, when L’étranger was nominated for being a promising independent band at the U-Knows, they faced an ethical dilemma due to the event's corporate sponsor having investments in South Africa during apartheid. The band considered boycotting the ceremony but reconsidered after being offered as winners, highlighting their struggle between personal ethics and career advancement.

4. **Impact on Their Career**: Choosing not to attend the ceremony because of its association with apartheid had negative repercussions for the band’s reputation within the music industry, despite their commitment to justice over complicity in racial oppression.

### Broader Social Justice Context

1. **Legacy of Activism**: The text reflects on past activism related to racial and social justice issues, such as the Toronto march against the police killing of Albert Johnson. It emphasizes how these early movements have laid the groundwork for modern initiatives like Black Lives Matter and Indigenous activism.

2. **Current Challenges**: Despite progress in areas like music and culture where Black and hip-hop influences are prominent, systemic racism persists, particularly within law enforcement and the justice system. Statistics such as 90% of Canada’s Black community acknowledging systemic racism highlight ongoing issues.

3. **Historical vs. Present-Day Activism**: The text notes a concerning shift: past activists like those opposing Ernst Zündel operated from political margins, whereas today's racial justice movements must contend with hate messages even being amplified by elected leaders, complicating their fight against injustice.

Overall, the passage underscores both achievements and challenges in fighting for social justice. It highlights how early resistance has evolved into current movements while stressing that modern activists face a more complex and hostile environment compared to earlier times.
