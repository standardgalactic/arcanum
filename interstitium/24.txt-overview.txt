In Chapter 24, titled "Operation Race: To the Bottom," the narrative provides an in-depth look at labor protests and political tensions surrounding trade agreements in Canada during the late 1980s. The author reflects on their personal experiences with various strikes and demonstrations supporting industrial workers, often highlighting cases where marginalized groups faced severe wage cuts or job losses. These protests typically occurred in remote areas with little media coverage or political attention.

A memorable protest described involves a playful yet symbolic act by the Catholic Worker group at the Park Hyatt Hotel on Bloor Street. There, Canadian trade negotiator Simon Reisman was meeting with business elites to discuss a proposed free trade agreement with the United States. Protesters, donning toques and lumberjack jackets, staged a table hockey game outside the hotel, humorously challenging Reisman to a match, symbolizing their opposition to his negotiation stance.

The broader context is set by the intense debate over free trade during this period, particularly involving Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's efforts to promote a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States. This initiative marked a significant shift from Mulroney's earlier promises as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, where he had opposed such agreements on grounds of protecting Canadian sovereignty.

The chapter also touches on historical policies that favored Canadian interests, like the Auto Pact signed in 1965 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. This pact allowed US-made vehicles to enter Canada duty-free if they adhered to production quotas for Canadian plants, leading to a boost in local manufacturing. Union activist Hemi Mitic comments on how these jobs were secured more due to economic advantages like public healthcare rather than any particular merit of the workforce.

Overall, this chapter captures the tension between national economic policies and global trade pressures, reflecting broader themes of labor rights, sovereignty, and political change during a pivotal time in Canadian history.


The passage you've provided outlines significant aspects of Canada's journey toward implementing the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States in the mid-1980s, under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

### Background Context
1. **Auto Pact and Its Importance**: The Auto Pact was a critical trade agreement that greatly benefited the Canadian economy by allowing integrated automobile production between Canada and the U.S. This pact facilitated economic growth and job creation within Canada's automotive sector.

2. **Shift in Policy Under Mulroney**: Upon winning the 1984 election, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signaled his willingness to renegotiate this agreement as part of broader efforts to reshape trade relations with the United States. This was a significant shift from prior commitments made to his Conservative base and marked a readiness to discuss larger changes in bilateral trade dynamics.

### Efforts Toward Free Trade
3. **Negotiations Initiated**: Shortly after taking office, Mulroney took proactive steps toward advocating for a North American single integrated market. He communicated directly with President Ronald Reagan, suggesting the idea of free trade between Canada and the U.S., even putting major Canadian resources like petroleum on negotiation tables.

4. **Implications of Free Trade Agreement**:
   - **Energy Policies**: One critical concern was that under such an agreement, Canadian sovereignty over energy policy would be compromised. The government's ability to prioritize national interests regarding its vast energy reserves would be curtailed.
   - **Proportional Sharing Clause**: As highlighted by activist Maude Barlow, this clause meant Canada could not reduce oil exports to the U.S. during shortages without equally cutting back on domestic supplies, effectively integrating Canadian energy with North American demands.

5. **Water Resources at Risk**: The agreement also exposed Canada's substantial natural water resources to potential exploitation, with provisions that would prevent government interference in diverting water to regions like the American southwest.

### Public Response and Political Dynamics
6. **Shamrock Summit (March 1985)**: This event symbolized the official introduction of free trade discussions between Canadian and U.S. leaders amidst public skepticism. It involved a culturally themed presentation designed to present the negotiations positively, but was seen by many as superficial.

7. **Counter-Movement**: In response to the government's stance, various groups organized protests across Canada. The Maple Leaf Summit emerged from these efforts, spearheading opposition through the formation of networks like Pro Canada Network aimed at challenging the free trade initiative.

8. **Negotiation and Agreement Announcement (Late 1987)**: Despite significant public dissent and behind-the-scenes negotiations, an agreement on the FTA was announced. This marked a pivotal moment in North American economic relations but also highlighted tensions between governmental actions and public sentiment.

In summary, this period marked a transformative era in Canadian trade policy, characterized by strategic renegotiations aimed at deeper integration with the U.S., substantial debates over national resource sovereignty, and considerable domestic opposition to perceived erosions of Canada's autonomy.


The passage provides an overview of the political and economic consequences following the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1988, focusing on its impact on Canadian sovereignty and economy.

### Political Context:
- **1988 Federal Election:** The FTA was a central issue during this election, with opposition from key figures like NDP leader Ed Broadbent and Liberal leader John Turner.
- Despite public opposition, the agreement passed due to vote splitting between these opposition parties. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government won re-election with a narrow majority.

### Economic Impact:
- **Trade Growth:** Post-agreement, trade between Canada and the U.S. significantly increased, from $116 billion in 1985 to $240 billion by 2002, marking a 221% rise.
- **Job Losses:** The agreement led to substantial job losses in Canadian manufacturing, with an estimated 334,000 jobs (17% of the sector) disappearing as companies like Inglis and General Tire moved production to the U.S.

### Investment Dynamics:
- **Foreign Investment:** Contrary to promises of reciprocal investment opportunities, most American capital entered Canada through corporate takeovers rather than new investments. Between 1985 and 2002, over 96% of foreign investment in Canada went into acquiring Canadian companies.
- **Canadian Investment Abroad:** Conversely, Canadian companies acquired less than 0.6% of U.S. industrial capacity.

### Sovereignty and Trade Relations:
- The passage highlights a perceived loss of economic sovereignty for Canada as American interests maintained protectionist measures, exemplified by the ongoing softwood lumber dispute.
- Simon Reisman, one of the negotiators, later criticized the U.S. for not honoring their commitments under the agreement.

### Strategic Implications:
- **Negotiation Choices:** The FTA was part of a broader strategy that began in 1980 to reshape economic power dynamics, prioritizing corporate interests over local economies and working-class empowerment.
- **Canadian Autonomy:** The passage suggests that Canadians' ability to independently determine their economic future was significantly curtailed, aligning more with corporate agendas.

Overall, the text portrays the FTA as a pivotal moment in Canadian history, where economic growth through increased trade came at significant social costs, including job losses and diminished national autonomy.


The passage discusses economic shifts in North America during the 1980s and 1990s, focusing on trade agreements that significantly impacted labor markets and worker rights. Economist Sam Gindin provides insight into how leftist movements in Canada initially made some headway within capitalism by successfully fighting back against unfavorable conditions in sectors like auto manufacturing. However, over time, these efforts were worn down due to the lack of broader support, leading to a marginalization of left-leaning groups. Social democracy increasingly aligned with accommodating capitalist interests, leaving workers feeling disillusioned and uncertain about their ability to achieve meaningful victories.

The 1980s began with policies aimed at weakening labor power, culminating in the adoption of free trade agreements that prioritized corporate interests over worker rights. This shift was part of a broader strategy by big capital to move production to lower-wage areas while reducing obligations to social, corporate, and labor responsibilities—a phase Gindin terms "Operation Race to the Bottom."

In 1989, negotiations for a continent-wide trade agreement began in Washington with Mexico, leading to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed by Canada under Prime Minister Mulroney and the United States under President Bill Clinton in 1991. Despite significant opposition from union workers within the Democratic Party due to concerns over wage disparities and job losses, NAFTA was ratified without provisions for a level playing field.

The result of NAFTA saw a massive shift of manufacturing jobs to Mexico's low-wage maquiladora zones, facilitated by substantial corporate tax breaks and minimal worker rights enforced by the government. The agreement disproportionately favored corporations at the expense of Mexican workers, whose wages significantly declined relative to American workers. This economic restructuring also devastated Mexican agriculture by flooding it with cheaper American imports, leading to increased drug trade activities and migration as people sought better opportunities.

Overall, the passage reflects on how these economic policies reshaped labor dynamics in North America, often to the detriment of worker rights and conditions while benefiting corporate interests.


The passage discusses the impacts of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on labor markets in the United States and Canada, as well as broader implications for global trade practices.

### Impact on Labor Markets

1. **United States:**
   - NAFTA led to a decline in manufacturing jobs due to employers threatening to move production to Mexico where labor was cheaper.
   - Workers faced wage reductions and increased job insecurity, often transitioning to lower-paying service sector roles.
   - The potential for moving operations undermined workers’ ability to negotiate effectively.

2. **Canada:**
   - Southern Ontario's auto industry experienced significant job losses as a result of NAFTA.
   - Previously negotiated advantages under the Auto Pact were negated by the new trade agreement, which shifted manufacturing jobs southward due to cheaper labor costs in Mexico.

### Broader Implications for Global Trade

- **Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS):**
  - Central to NAFTA was the ISDS provision, which granted corporations significant power to challenge domestic laws through private tribunals if those laws threatened profits.
  - This effectively placed corporate interests on par with governmental authority, undermining democratic processes.

- **Globalization and Offshoring:**
  - NAFTA initiated a trend that led to widespread globalization practices.
  - ISDS provisions were integrated into subsequent international trade agreements, particularly affecting emerging economies in the Global South.
  - Corporations used these mechanisms to challenge environmental, public health, energy, and land use policies.

- **Political Reactions:**
  - In Canada, there was significant opposition to NAFTA due to its perceived betrayal of worker interests. This sentiment contributed to political shifts, though promises to renegotiate were largely unfulfilled.
  - Globalization efforts continued with Canadian leadership pursuing trade missions in Asia, focusing on opening markets for corporate expansion rather than protecting domestic jobs.

- **Offshoring:**
  - Corporations moved not only manufacturing but also a wide range of jobs (e.g., tech support, call centers) to countries with lower wages and fewer regulations.
  - Proponents argued that globalization would spread democracy, though this claim was more aspirational than reflective of immediate outcomes.

Overall, the passage highlights how NAFTA facilitated labor market shifts in North America, strengthened corporate power through ISDS provisions, and fueled broader trends in globalization and offshoring. These changes had profound implications for democratic governance and workers' rights across multiple countries.


The text provides a critical perspective on globalization's impact, particularly highlighting its promises versus actual outcomes, as discussed by various commentators like Maude Barlow, Vincent Bevins, Jeff Faux, and Hemi Mitic.

1. **Promises of Globalization**: Initially, globalization was portrayed as universally beneficial, with claims that it would elevate everyone economically, from large corporations to individual workers (the "trickle-down" effect). It suggested that corporate efficiency would replace government oversight for better outcomes.

2. **Outcomes Disparity**: However, the reality showed a different picture—while wealth accumulation increased significantly among the global elite ("yachts"), it largely bypassed smaller stakeholders and working-class individuals. The benefits were not as widely distributed as promised, exacerbating economic inequities.

3. **Impact in the Global South**: In many developing countries, globalization led to significant privatization of public assets, enriching a small segment (the new 1 percent) while increasing repression and inequality. For instance, Egypt saw wealth shift dramatically due to these policies.

4. **Repression and Resistance**: The implementation of neoliberal reforms often necessitated suppressing dissent, reminiscent of tactics used in Chile during the 1970s. This led to global waves of protest movements in the 2010s as people resisted the growing inequality and repression.

5. **Effects in Developed Nations**: In countries like the United States, globalization resulted in substantial job losses (over 5 million) and factory closures (70,000), benefiting primarily the wealthy elite. These economic shifts were often ignored or overshadowed by a culture of excessive consumerism and flaunted wealth during the 1990s and 2000s.

6. **Pandemic as a Turning Point**: The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 highlighted vulnerabilities in global supply chains and exposed the unsustainable nature of prior economic practices. This crisis led to workers increasingly rejecting low wages and job insecurity, spurring labor activism reminiscent of historical movements like the Flint sit-down strikes.

7. **Renewed Labor Activism**: Worker dissatisfaction with poor conditions has reignited union activities and labor rights discussions globally. The U.S., in particular, is experiencing a resurgence of interest in protecting workers' rights and ensuring good-paying jobs.

8. **Political Shifts**: Politicians are beginning to acknowledge these issues, showing more support for unionization and job protection than seen in decades. This shift indicates an awareness of the changing economic landscape and growing public demand for fairer labor practices.

Overall, while globalization promised widespread prosperity, it instead led to increased inequality, repression, and eventual backlash from workers worldwide, prompting a reevaluation of these policies.


The passage discusses a significant labor movement involving simultaneous strikes against all three major U.S. auto companies—an unprecedented action highlighting growing union strength and activism. This concerted effort is notable not only for its scale but also for the involvement of high-profile figures, such as the President of the United States joining the picket lines. In Canada, similar labor actions have resulted in historic gains for unions within the auto sector.

The passage emphasizes a shift in the dynamics between labor and capital, driven by increasingly militant activism, particularly among younger workers from Generation Z. This group is portrayed as forward-thinking and committed to reshaping the traditional business models by advocating for more sustainable futures through active participation in labor movements. An article in Fortune underscores Gen Z's determination to challenge the status quo and usher in a new era of workplace activism.

The text also reflects on historical contexts, suggesting that past economic disparities, particularly those exacerbated by free trade policies, were not inevitable outcomes but rather constructed scenarios detrimental to working and middle classes. The author argues for the possibility of imagining and realizing an alternative future where worker rights are restored, drawing from "dangerous memories" of past struggles that secured these rights.

Ultimately, the passage hints at a potential resolution to lingering socio-economic issues reminiscent of the 1980s, suggesting that current activism might lead to significant changes in labor relations and economic policies. This optimistic view posits that understanding and learning from historical movements can empower workers today to redefine their futures and achieve more equitable conditions.
