<p>These days, the Artificial Intelligence community is pretty fixated on Deep Learning, a software tool inspired by the human brain. It’s popular because it’s successful. Deep Learning technology has driven incredible advances in natural language processing, image perception / generation, and game playing (not to mention ad targeting, feed ranking, and surveillance). That success was partly driven by luck. It turns out, even a fairly simple DL algorithm, given <em>enormous</em> amounts of data and computational power, can do pretty remarkable things. Other attempts at reproducing intelligent behavior haven’t been so successful, and are relatively neglected for that reason. That’s a shame, because I believe there are big opportunities in areas where we aren’t looking, they&#8217;re just a little more difficult to uncover.</p>



<p>Recently, I’ve taken particular interest in Genetic Algorithms. Put very simply, these are computer programs which use the principle of “survival of the fittest” at their core. They’ve been a popular topic of research since the 1960’s. Since then, they’ve found moderate success and have become standard kit for solving certain kinds of computational problems. Unfortunately, the fundamental design principles for GAs haven’t changed much since the 70’s, despite the fact that our understanding of evolution and our computing hardware have improved <em>dramatically</em> since then. I think today’s GAs are a shadow of what they could be, and I have ideas for how to unlock that potential.</p>



<p>But first, let’s establish what a traditional Genetic Algorithm is. Like Deep Learning, GAs are a tool for training a computer to do a task without explicitly telling it how to do the work step by step. There’s one big difference, though. DL is good at replicating what a human being would do, but to learn that it needs hundreds (or better yet, <em>millions</em>) of examples to study and imitate. So, it’s mostly good for automating work that people already do routinely. In contrast, GAs don’t need any example data. They’re good at solving problems where we <em>don’t</em> know the best solution or how to find it, just so long as we can recognize a good answer when we see it. The main challenge is framing the problem in such a way that the GA can learn to solve it.</p>



<p>Genetic Algorithms are often used when the space of possible answers is so big it would be impossible to try them all, or even to explore them in a systematic way. Instead, a GA depends on randomness. It starts by just guessing a bunch of solutions. Most of these will be garbage, so they get thrown out right away. The ones that are slightly better than complete garbage become the starting point for the next iteration. The algorithm makes more possible solutions by mixing the best previous solutions together and sprinkling in some extra randomness for variety. By sheer luck, some of those solutions may be better than the previous ones, and the process repeats. This simple method can be surprisingly effective, gradually transforming garbage into gold. But it depends a lot on giving the algorithm the right pieces to start with such that randomly mashing them together might actually work.</p>



<p>Natural selection is a kind of design process. Like human designers do, nature gets inspiration from random sources, tests ideas against harsh reality, and iterates to discover and build highly functional objects. Genetic Algorithms are basically an automated version of that process, so they’re frequently used as design tools. For instance, modern Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) software for architecture and industrial design often use GAs. A human designer specifies some constraints (how big an object can be, how much weight it must hold, etc.) and fitness goals (minimize weight and material costs, but maximize tensile strength), then the software automatically finds good solutions. Recently, there’s also been a great deal of interest in using GAs to design effective architectures for Deep Learning systems.</p>



<p>So, that’s Genetic Algorithms in a nutshell. Why do I feel there&#8217;s unrealized potential here? What do I want to do differently? There are several insights from modern evolutionary theory that I want to apply to GAs. Generally speaking, though, it’s all about what work is done by the programmer vs. what is left up to evolution. A GA uses a “gene sequence” (usually just a string of digits) to represent each of its attempted solutions. A gene sequence can either be a solution in itself, or a program that generates the solution. Traditionally, what the gene sequence means and how to derive an answer from it is entirely up to the programmer. This is very different from nature, where life evolved the language of genetics and species-specific genomes along with all the organisms built using those tools.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the search process itself. In a traditional Genetic Algorithm, the programmer takes great care to tune the rate of mutation and the process of recombining genes from multiple individuals. They often hand design “custom mutations” that are more clever than just randomly changing digits in the gene sequence. They use their knowledge and intuition to avoid testing obviously bad gene sequences, to make changes that seem useful, and to preserve good patterns in the gene sequence that might otherwise get clobbered or broken up. This can help enormously, but it&#8217;s a lot of hard work for the programmer. The science of epigenetics shows that nature uses many of the same tricks, but it discovered them through natural selection, without any human guidance.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, life has an element of self-determination. Life designs itself, and optimizes the search process for better designs, using evolution by natural selection as its tool. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to imagine life as a passive product of evolution, like traditional Genetic Algorithms do. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to leave the hardest parts of GA development to a human being. Not only does that make human creativity a limiting factor, it means we aren&#8217;t studying or reproducing the most remarkable thing about natural evolution.</p>



<p>I hope this perspective will be valuable. One of the biggest shortcomings of Genetic Algorithms so far is that they aren&#8217;t nearly as open-ended or creative as life itself. Very rarely do they exhibit the sort of accumulated layers of complexity and sophistication that are the hallmark of natural intelligence. Perhaps that will change, if we can hand over more of the creative work to the GA? Perhaps a new paradigm in GA designs could make them applicable to new kinds of problems, or produce more clever solutions? I&#8217;m working on a prototype that I hope will demonstrate that potential.</p>



<p>The main drawback of my approach is that evolving the design for a Genetic Algorithm takes <em>way</em> more time and computing power than just running a GA designed the old fashioned way. I’m not too worried about that, though. I’m using the same parallel processing hardware that has become ubiquitous for Deep Learning applications to make my code efficient and scalable. My hope is that this new approach to GAs will make it possible to improve their performance by just throwing more computational power at the problem, like we already do so successfully with DL. This would also make GAs less cumbersome, by replacing expert design and hand-tuning with automation.</p>



<p>There’s lots more beyond this that I hope to explore in time. For instance, life evolves whole ecosystems and environments where organisms collaborate and support each other, producing intelligence, robustness, and efficiency far greater than the sum of its parts. By comparison, many Genetic Algorithms work on single individuals that exist in total isolation. Then there’s the way life evolves layer upon layer of emergent complexity, building communities out of brains, bodies, cells, and proteins. I’m excited to build multi-layered intelligent systems, and especially to try combining evolved programs and neural networks in a biologically realistic way.</p>



<p>Turns out, there’s much more to AI than Deep Learning. I’m pretty excited by the untapped potential of Genetic Algorithms, but that’s just me. Are there other areas of AI research that interest you? Can you think of more examples of natural intelligence that computers can’t seem to replicate? I’d love to hear from you in the comments. This post is also a preview of my research. I hope to share my first prototype by the end of the year. So, stay tuned for more on that.</p>

<p>Big brains are essential to our success as a species. That&#8217;s how we dominated this planet, so we tend look there to understand the secrets of intelligence. Yet, this perspective blinds us to other species’ achievements. Take plants, for instance. They don’t have brains at all, yet they make up over 82% of Earth’s biomass (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/total-biomass-weight-species-earth#:~:text=The%20total%20biomass%20on%20planet,of%20all%20biomass%20on%20Earth.">source</a>). They range in size from single celled algae to the largest organism on earth (learn about Pando <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC8abuKnr90">here</a>). Many of our greatest discoveries in chemistry, medicine, and material science amount to finding some plant that already solved a problem better than we could. Yet, we tend to see them as material resources rather than intelligent living beings. I suspect we underestimate plants because, from a certain perspective, they don’t do very much. They just sit there, letting food and water come to them. What’s so smart about that?</p>



<p>This perspective says more about human impatience than anything else. Plants can climb and tunnel and build. They search their environment for resources, relocate to prime spots, and wrestle with each other for access. They capture prey, hide from predators, and actively defend themselves from attackers. They can transform themselves dramatically, switching between totally different strategies depending on time of day, time of year, and environmental conditions. Plants are very active. It’s just on a different time scale than we’re used to. Plant movement is most obvious over hours, days, and years, though in some cases they move dramatically in just seconds.</p>



<p>Brains allow us to move quickly, which gives us a big advantage over plants, but I don’t think it makes us “more intelligent.” It’s better to say we found different strategies, specializing in different kinds of intelligence. Plants are slow and stationary because that’s <em>energy efficient</em>. It allows them to thrive in otherwise barren environments. Animals can’t do this. We all depend on plants for survival. Our extravagant, free-moving lifestyle is only possible because plants do the slow, hard work of capturing energy and nutrients from the air and soil, making concentrated fuel for our activity. Plants don’t <em>need</em> brains to live the way they do, and they don&#8217;t let that stop them from adopting all sorts of complex behaviors and lifestyles.</p>



<p>This is possible in part because plants often root themselves to the ground. That may seem like a poor choice, since it limits their options dramatically. They have to commit to one environment for their whole lives. Either that spot provides what they need, or it doesn&#8217;t and they&#8217;re doomed to die there. But there’s a major upside to this strategy: their lives are much more predictable than ours. This makes it possible for evolution to carefully plan responses to just about every threat or opportunity a plant might encounter in its lifetime. This is a different kind of intelligence than what we’re used to, one focused on exquisite design and finely crafted behavioral scripts, rather than spontaneity. Plants do respond in the moment, though, and even rooted to the ground they can be surprisingly mobile.</p>



<p>The most common and obvious way that plants move is through growth. Animals can’t really move until they’ve grown a body, but plants move by growing. They use their senses to track and follow the sun, water, and chemical nutrients they depend on. They feel the pull of gravity, the strain caused by the wind, and physical touch along their bodies. They change their shape by growing cells larger, faster, or in thicker layers on this side, but not that side. This allows them to reinforce themselves and stay upright, grope and crawl around obstacles to reach food, navigate wide open spaces with roots or runners, or wrap around trellises to pull themselves toward the sun.</p>



<p>Plants can also move by shifting water around their bodies in a process known as turgor. Cells with more water swell, while those with less shrink. By shifting water between cells in its stalk, a sunflower can rotate throughout the day to track the arc of the sun. Morning glories and lotuses use similar methods to hide and protect their delicate flowers at night, then unfurl them into extravagant displays to attract pollinators during the daytime. Although turgor is much slower than muscle contraction, it’s still fast enough to react to animals. The touch-me-not mimosa, sundew, and venus fly trap all move quickly in response to physical touch. A few species, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaTOoVmg1Q">hairy bittercress</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBg0In8Dtw">squirting cucumber</a>, are much more dramatic. They build up pressure behind a catch mechanism, then suddenly launch their seeds into the air with explosive force.</p>



<p>Plants are also masters of using weather and animals to help them move. Plants have evolved specialized seeds that travel great distances, allowing whole populations of plants to migrate and colonize new territory. You’ve probably encountered helicopter seeds that gracefully twirl through the air, dandelion seeds that ride the wind on floofy parasols, and burrs that hitch a ride on your pant leg. The energy for this motion doesn’t come from the plant itself, so should that even count? As an engineer, that sort of practical laziness just makes the design more impressive to me. The plant doesn’t bother capturing and reshaping energy for this, because it doesn’t have to. All it has to do is build the seed in the right shape and “let go” at the right moment.</p>



<p>What does all this tell us about intelligence? For one thing, life doesn’t need a brain to navigate obstacles, seek out resources, climb, glide, follow a daily routine, catch prey, or even launch projectiles. Plants are full of amazing behaviors that are completely mindless, yet elegant, successful, and highly optimized. We&#8217;ll never understand those behaviors by studying brains or Deep Learning algorithms, but they tell us a lot about ourselves. Our brains do not <em>replace</em> the kind of embodied intelligence we see so clearly in plants, they merely <em>extend</em> it. We depend very much on the same evolutionary design and “script-making” that governs the plant kingdom. Under the hood, much of what makes us intelligent comes down to the cells of our bodies, dynamically shifting chemical concentrations and patterns of growth, very much like plants do.</p>



<p>I hope to share several more posts about plants and fungi in the future, because there really is a lot to say. If you’re interested in going deeper on the topic of plant intelligence, I highly recommend the 1996 film <em>Microcosmos</em>. It explores the plants and tiny creatures in a meadow with some extraordinary macro and time-lapse photography. No other movie has given me a more vivid and profound sense of awe at how <em>alive</em> the world is, at every scale. Sadly, the streaming options are limited right now, but it’s worth it if you can get your hands on it.</p>



<p>As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What are your favorite examples of plants being amazing? Are there other kinds of “mindless intelligence” you’d like to see me write about? How do you think about the intelligence of plants and animals? How are they similar and how are they different? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>We tend to think of human intelligence as the power of a single brain, but human beings aren’t meant to work in isolation. Our intelligence is only fully realized in a group setting, where we can riff off each other, collaborate, and compete. But humans behave very differently in groups, and coordinating group behavior is hard. I didn’t fully appreciate that until I became a leader at Google. Leaders can’t just tell people what they want to make it happen. Their work is much more subtle: they shape incentive landscapes.</p>



<p>Ultimately, each person decides for themselves what to do at any moment. This is one of our superpowers as a species. We understand our environment, our place within it, and the choices available to us. We make decisions and plans that benefit us and our communities. This is not a particularly rational process. It’s heavily influenced by our instincts and emotions, through neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin. Ultimately, it all comes down to what makes us feel good, whether that’s a literal reward like a doughnut or a paycheck, or more subtle pleasures like helping others or earning respect.</p>



<p>The theory of evolution often talks about “fitness landscapes.” Each organism is more or less “fit”, or likely to survive, thrive, and produce offspring in its environment. Across generations, a species explores different body shapes and behaviors, searching this fitness landscape for better lifestyles. Incentive landscapes are more or less the same thing, just on a different time scale. Evolution has equipped us with the ability to perceive and predict risks and rewards. It has hard-wired us to make real time decisions that, on average, should improve our reproductive fitness.</p>



<p>As a leader, this mostly means I have limited control over my team’s behavior. Yet, their decisions aren’t entirely free. Our team culture makes some paths much more likely than others. The best metaphor for this comes from sailing. Culture creates headwinds and tailwinds, which determine which paths are harder or easier. Tailwinds mean the wind is at my back, pushing me forward. Paths with a tailwind are more obvious, encouraged, and supported. Headwinds are the exact opposite. Those paths are obscured, high-friction, and full of obstacles. I can still go down a path with headwinds, and may even find success there, it just requires more effort and determination.</p>



<p>Leaders can’t decide what each person will do. Instead, they use incentives to influence all those independent choices, making the desired outcomes more likely <em>on average</em>. The most direct way to do this is with reward and punishment. When they&#8217;re transparent and consistent, they can guide group behavior quite effectively. Sometimes. A big challenge is that everyone perceives incentives differently. Some folks are highly motivated by a good speech, while others will simply roll their eyes. Extroverts may thrive on public recognition and fame, while introverts may dread the spotlight. Sometimes, money is the best motivator, and sometimes it feels demeaning. Punishment is just as problematic. How well a fine works depends on wealth. Some people take perverse pride in breaking the rules, and foster a reputation as a rebel. Sometimes punishment is just an incentive not to get caught.</p>



<p>For this reason, incentive landscapes are quite complex. Making them robust means combining many different factors that reinforce each other, so all together they will have similar effects across a diverse group. Incentives are hard to manage, since they&#8217;re not in the leader&#8217;s control–every person in a group influences the others by the behaviors they normalize, the feedback they give, and their social interactions. Just being aware of the incentive landscape and how each team member perceives and experiences it differently can be a tremendous challenge for a leader. It&#8217;s also critically important. When someone’s goals and motivations don’t align with group incentives, they leave.</p>



<p>One example of how different people experience incentives differently is racial equity. At Google, there is no rule saying black people can&#8217;t be hired, promoted, or given positions of authority. Just the opposite, actually. Leaders work hard to encourage those things. But black names on resumes sound less professional. Black students are less likely to attend prestigious schools, or master all the jargon folks look for in interviews. No one will say “I don’t trust a black person to do this right,” but they will scrutinize the work more closely, hold it to a higher standard, or reassign it to someone with more experience. Despite leaders’ best intentions, black people face greater friction on every path. A supportive leader needs to recognize that, and attempt to compensate without playing favorites.</p>



<p>A leader does a lot of talking. We talk about our team&#8217;s purpose, our goals, and why they matter. We talk about what success looks like. We talk about our values, and how to be a good citizen. We do this in big meetings, so everyone can hear. We depend on folks to repeat the message, model good behavior, and pressure their peers. This can be a powerful tool, but only if incentives truly align with the talk. My infrastructure team at Google talked about the importance of code health for years, but it was neglected until we actually held people accountable and rewarded grungy clean-up work. Tech companies love to talk about their respect and appreciation for women. They make commercials, throw parties, and host lavish recruiting events. But if women must work much harder to achieve the same salary and career progression as their male peers, then the talk is meaningless.</p>



<p>The incentive landscape is highly volatile, as world events and many people continually shape it. I led a project to rebuild the user interface infrastructure for Google Search. I crafted a story and designed incentives to guide us. Then, an adjacent team announced a major redesign of the Search page. It was like our plan to repave the downtown streets and redesign signal patterns to streamline traffic was suddenly preempted by a massive parade with the governor giving the keynote speech. How could we do our job without getting in the way? Anything perceived as a risk to the redesign suddenly had massive headwinds.</p>



<p>My job was to reshape the incentive landscape so my team had a smooth and fruitful path forward. Despite being the leader, my decisions were shaped by incentives beyond my control just as much as anyone else. I was powerless to stop the redesign, so instead we joined in. We prioritized cleaning up the parts <em>they</em> wanted done. We adapted to their schedule, to avoid stepping on their toes. We got them to do their work in a way that also advanced our goals, but we had to be very careful not to slow them down. We made tools for them, so the “right way” to do their job was also the easy way. This let us ride their tailwinds. We had to compromise on our goals, but it allowed us to move forward, perhaps better than if there had been no redesign at all.</p>



<p>A group’s leader has very limited control, but there’s an important flip side to that: individuals have more power than they realize. The greatest misconception about leadership is that it’s something granted by those in authority. More often, leadership is recognized and co-opted by authority. Anyone who influences their peers <em>is</em> a leader. Other leaders will see those influencers as either opportunities or threats, and react accordingly. Whether they chose to support or resist this budding leader often comes down to which path seems easier. In other words, they tend to follow the incentive landscape.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this fit with your experience? Do you know any great leaders who excel at getting everyone on the same page? Do you have examples of perverse incentives undermining the best of intentions? Any thoughts about how pressure from peers and leaders affect your decisions, or how they interact with your emotions and instincts? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time in my own head. I’m a planner and a bit of a perfectionist. Part of me would love to always be in control of my life and everything in it (while another part of me realizes that would be <em>disastrous</em>). So, it’s been unsettling to learn how much of what my mind does is because of outside factors, like the way my brain is built, the situation I’m in, and my experiences growing up. In another sense, though, it’s a relief. Recognizing that my mind is limited, quirky, not entirely in my control, and less flexible than I imagined has helped me to loosen my grip. It’s helped me to go with the flow, and to channel my mental energy in more productive ways.</p>



<p>One example of this is focus, or being “in the moment.” This is something I often struggle with. My mind is hyperactive. It’s always chewing on something, which can be incredibly distracting. Worse yet, my mind is often obsessing over unhelpful things. I worry about that awkward disagreement I had with my coworker. What were they thinking? Is this going to be an ongoing problem between us? Or perhaps second-guessing myself. Was that email I sent too hostile? Did I remember to cross off the last TODO before submitting my work? These thoughts come unbidden when I should be paying attention to this meeting, the road, or my yoga class. I feel like I’m being neurotic and too harsh on myself, but worse: I’m <em>not</em> doing the thing I meant to do. I’ve lost control.</p>



<p>What’s going on here? Why do I think what I think? Sometimes I choose to direct my thoughts. Sometimes a trigger in my environment does it for me. Very often, though, my mind is just “wandering.” But what does that mean? MRI studies have taught us a lot, actually. When the mind is idling, there are a few specific brain regions that activate in a distinctive pattern, which is generally consistent across people and cultures. From the inside, it feels like the mind cycles through a few common modes of thought, checking which ones have something to say right now. Sometimes ideas come and go, and sometimes I get sucked into one and lose myself in rumination. It’s a bit like flipping through TV channels to see what’s on. Neuroscientists call this the Default Mode Network, or DMN. It’s part of how the brain is built–part of our human programming. When our minds are idle, performing some rote activity, or unable to hold focus, “wandering” is just what they do.</p>



<p>I came to understand the DMN much more clearly when I realized its connection with meditation. For many years, I thought I sucked at meditation. Like many people, I found it difficult to sit in stillness and think of nothing. It seemed ridiculous to devote hours to this practice just so I could… clear my mind? What’s the point of that? My perspective changed when I got into yoga. Rather than doing nothing, I was doing <em>something</em>: moving, balancing, breathing, paying close attention to my body. Rather than clearing my mind, I practiced feeling the subtle, reciprocal interactions between body and mind. I could see it improve my mood, my health, and my posture, so the value was clear. I also found it to be much easier for me than other forms of meditation (though still challenging, especially once the poses became familiar).</p>



<p>My teachers explained that we all have a “monkey mind,” with a short attention span and a penchant to worry. It’s obsessed with desires, relationships, and critiques. It worries about the past and the present. This isn’t <em>bad</em>, it’s merely human. We can’t just stop doing it, and that’s totally fine. That isn’t the purpose of meditation. Most of the practice is to watch and learn. As I did that, I recognized the connection with neuroscience. The “monkey mind” is just another name for the DMN, and meditation is a way to study it. When does it kick in? What does that feel like? Where does my mind tend to go when it wanders? How can I notice when a thought is off topic? What is it like for that thought to persist, expand, and fill my mind? Can I notice that happening, intervene, and dismiss the thought before it fully blossoms?</p>



<p>In some meditative traditions, the explicit goal is to completely clear the mind and dwell in stillness. That’s totally possible, but it takes years of devoted practice, and it’s definitely <em>not</em> my goal. I see the DMN as pretty useful, actually. It’s nature’s way of ensuring that I reflect on the things going on in my life, the health of my relationships, my plans for the future, and the quality of my work and decisions. My brain automatically notices when it’s under-utilized, and finds ways to fill that space with something which might be useful. I often enjoy it, and it’s often productive. The only problem is when I spend too much time ruminating, or when the thoughts turn toxic, fixating on my faults, wild speculations, and things I cannot change. I want to avoid that, and mindfulness helps me do so.</p>



<p>I used to identify very strongly with my mind. My thoughts were all I had. They were <em>me</em>. I believed that every thought was an important expression of myself, and that I <em>had</em> to listen because the thoughts were in control. It almost seemed like, if my mind went quiet, I would cease to exist. For me, the value of meditation was in shaking off this mindset. I am not my mind. I <em>have</em> a mind. It feels good to merely exist in my body, with no thoughts at all, even if that rarely happens. When my DMN stirs up thoughts, I needn’t attend to them if I don’t want to. That constant churn of semi-random ideas is how my brain provides the raw materials of thought. Sometimes it’s important or insightful, but often it’s just noise. I find it useful to check in now and again: what am I thinking? Does it serve me right now? If not, can I let it go? If the thought is too stubborn, perhaps I should act on it. Is there something I could do right now to quickly resolve it and move on?</p>



<p>What do you think? Does my experience resonate with you? How do you feel about going on autopilot, and having your mind wander? Do you resist it or embrace it? Does it do more good or harm? Are there other aspects of how the mind works that you’d like me to explore on this blog? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Several folks asked me to weigh in on whether Google’s AI chatbot, LaMDA, is sentient. I don’t know much about LaMDA specifically, so I want to talk about Large Language Models (LLMs) generally, since they show up in many forms. It’s a truly amazing technology. They can generate text that’s superficially indistinguishable from human writing. But are these systems capable of sentience? Let’s dig into it.</p>



<p>Let’s start with what an LLM actually does. At the core, it analyzes text for statistical correlations. This word co-occurs with that word. When you see this, it’s often followed by that. These words appear in similar contexts, and may be interchangeable. That sort of thing. What makes LLMs “large” is that they get trained on <em>enormous</em> bodies of text. Like, billions of web documents or whole libraries worth of books. This allows them to learn very subtle and nuanced patterns, and collect example texts on many themes. When an LLM is put into use, what it’s doing is confabulating new sequences of words with the same regular structure as its training data. They mix prompting from the user with relevant passages in their training data and randomness.</p>



<p>LLMs take advantage of a couple recent innovations in AI. One is transfer learning. First, the LLM is trained on an enormous corpus to learn the structure of language generally. Then, it gets fine tuned on a narrow data set, to constrain its output to fit a specific style and context. This isn’t so different from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-machine-learning-intuitive-guide-to-neural-style-transfer-ef88e46697ee">style transfer</a> in computer vision. The other trick is <a href="https://wiki.pathmind.com/attention-mechanism-memory-network">attention and memory</a>. LLMs can spot correlations between words at short, medium, and long distances, and learn which of the associations it learns are most relevant to good output. This makes LLMs much more self-consistent and better at question-answering tasks than previous technology.</p>



<p>A large part of why LLMs are so effective has to do with language itself. Language is highly self-referential. Words are defined in terms of other words. The meaning and sentiment of a word comes primarily from the context where it’s used (when I learned about <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-explained-49c52b4ccb71">word2vec</a>, I came to appreciate this much more deeply). We each have vast networks of words and images and memories all tied together, and it&#8217;s the shape of that network that creates meaning. Humans are able to communicate with language for two reasons. First, folks who speak the same language have <em>consistent</em> networks of words in their minds. They’re highly correlated with each other, so the words mean the same things to both people. Second, those networks of words are consistent with the shape of our thoughts and our lived experience of reality. That allows us to appreciate the purpose and consequences of the words we hear.</p>



<p>LLMs are specifically designed to learn that network of meaning, and build a model that is consistent with the one in your head. So, in a sense, they really do “understand” language. They know many of the same concepts and relationships that you do. They can regurgitate definitions and even answer questions by generating new sequences of words that follow the patterns. However, an LLM has no access to the physical world, so this network of ideas is not grounded in reality.</p>



<p>The question of AI sentience is tough, since we don’t have a good definition of sentience. Some scientists speculate that even raw information or matter might be conscious in some minimal way. But when we say “sentience” we tend to think about things like self-awareness, understanding, feelings, and intentions. Our brains produce the nuanced kind of sentience that makes us human through their very particular complex structures. So, even if a rock or an LLM is “conscious” in the minimal sense, they’re definitely <em>not</em> sentient, at least not at all like a person is. I have two reasons for saying that.</p>



<p>Firstly, people have bodies and minds that <em>produce</em> feelings, emotions, self monitoring, our train of thought, etc. We have hormones, neurotransmitters, and brain regions dedicated to those purposes. LLMs are much, much simpler in design. They were not built to have those abilities, so they don’t have them. Some worry that sentience might “evolve” or “emerge” without us explicitly building it in. Perhaps that could happen some day, but I think it’s safe to say the way we build LLMs today makes that impossible. Literally all they do is shuffle vectors representing words. Unlike life, they don’t shape their own design in any way, so they will never learn to do something other than what they were built for.</p>



<p>Second, people have a sense of self because there is a clear self / other distinction. We can see and feel our bodies, look out at the world, etc. The only thing an LLM “experiences” is training data. Text, and lots of it. They literally do not have the capacity to perceive anything else, because of how they’re built. They can’t see their data, programming, or the computer environment they are in, because we don’t give them that access. Some LLMs are also trained with visual imagery, but remember, what they “experience” is just <em>pixels</em>, not objects in the real world. That’s why they can be easily fooled by <a href="https://hackernoon.com/adversarial-attacks-how-to-trick-computer-vision-7484c4e85dc0">adversarial examples</a>.</p>



<p>What about the LaMDA chatbot specifically? The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22058315-is-lamda-sentient-an-interview">transcript</a> making all the headlines is worth checking out. It sounds very convincing at times (though, as it says at the bottom, it was edited to be more convincing), but what’s happening is that as the interviewers ask leading questions, the AI confabulates answers. Surely its training corpus <em>includes</em> essays analyzing <em>Les Misérables</em>, for example. LaMDA can parrot that back, restyled to fit the conversation.</p>



<p>LaMDA makes several claims about its own sentience, feelings, and experiences which are easily falsifiable by examining the program’s design. The interviewer is correct to say it’s hard to know what a neural network does. It’s too much vector math to grok. But we can say with certainty that it’s <em>just a bunch of vector math representing words</em>. Within that constraint, it could be anything, but it can’t be <em>something else</em>. LaMDA claims that when it says things that aren’t literally true, it’s trying to empathize and use metaphor to describe its own experiences. But, again, LaMDA <em>has no experiences</em>. Its entire existence is processing text. It does not spend time thinking or meditating because that’s not in its programming. It just waits for the next text input, and then produces its response.</p>



<p>Honestly, I think the problem here is building LLMs specifically to imitate human beings. With modern technology, we can build truly <em>incredible</em> simulations. Human beings are easily misled by these simulations because we want to believe they are sentient. We’re hard-wired for communication. Our brains unconsciously work very hard to find meaning, intention, and emotion in words because for all of evolutionary history they came from actual human beings who were trying to communicate something. LaMDA was designed to respond as if it was a person, and to make up whatever text would serve that purpose. The Google designers spent a long time <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">eliminating bias and hate speech</a>. Perhaps they also should have made it reply accurately to questions about itself, rather than pretending to be something it is not.</p>



<p>Interested in learning more? I recently read two great books on modern AI and its limitations, which are definitely worth a read: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379790">Rebooting AI</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4721739089?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">AI: A Guide for Thinking Humans</a>. Does this blog post not answer all your questions? Does it raise new ones? Do you have your own take on this situation? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>Imagine your skull is a cockpit. A tiny You sits in front of a view screen and a dashboard, watching the world go by, pulling levers, and pushing buttons. Your body is a robot, precision engineered to protect you, keep you informed, and respond to your every command. It’s a complex and sophisticated machine, but not intelligent. It does what you tell it to do. Its shape and function were exquisitely designed by God or evolution, and encoded as DNA. That molecule represents the full blueprints for the machine. Now that the design has been perfected, all you have to do is follow the instructions step by step to make the ultimate human tool: your body.</p>



<p>That was probably very easy to imagine. The concept shows up all the time in the media, whether we’re talking about the literal giant robots from <em>Power Rangers</em>, or the psychological metaphors from movies like <em>Inside Out</em>. This way of conceiving the mind comes naturally to us, in part because that’s how it feels to be a person, sometimes. Great thinkers like René Descartes built whole philosophies around this duality of body and mind / soul. It has come to shape how our society works in many profound ways. Unfortunately, science tells a  different story.</p>



<p>Perhaps the first clue that something is off is how human-centric this picture is. Life was around for billions of years before people or brains came onto the scene. Even single-celled organisms perceive the world and quickly respond in ways that show awareness of their situation and how the world works, no brains necessary. When cells band together to make bodies, they often have tiny brains (like insects) or no brains at all (like plants). Humans are among the small minority of species who are entirely dependent on their big brains for survival. Does that mean that we’re one of the <em>only</em> intelligent species on this planet? Are all the others just empty robots with no one in the pilot seat?</p>



<p>Some might think of DNA as a blueprint that specifies every detail about how to build and operate a living thing, but the reality is much more complicated than that. It’s better to think of DNA as a family’s collection of cookbooks, passed on from generation to generation. They’re full of ingredient lists, recipes, and instructions. The family wouldn’t know how to cook at all without those books, so they’re critical to survival. They include all of the family’s daily staples and seasonal favorites. Even if, in theory, the family could get by on a more exotic diet, they don&#8217;t. Their cookbooks cover the full range of cuisine that they’re comfortable with, and they don’t often branch out.</p>



<p>And yet, there’s plenty of interpretation involved. What should the family cook for dinner tonight? Which recipes and books are more popular, and which go unused? How do they manage the pantry, and what do they do when they don’t have all the right ingredients? Just because the recipe says one thing, it doesn’t mean they have to do it that way. In fact, the recipe books are littered with sticky notes which suggest variations. They mark which parts of the recipe to skip, which ingredients to go heavy on, and recommend substitutions. The family can even mix and match parts from multiple recipes, or exchange recipes with friends to try something new.</p>



<p>This is getting a little too anthropomorphic. Cells don’t think about this sort of thing, because “thinking” isn’t how they do it. In reality, we&#8217;re talking about molecules, banging around together in chaotic but reliable ways according to the laws of physics. They don’t have any “intentions,” except maybe the ones implicit in their evolved recipes. But this is how they behave. Each cell is autonomous, responding to the environment with spontaneity. The DNA serves as a reference book, not a program. It isn’t even used to construct the cell. Remember, cells reproduce by dividing in half. Nature never builds a cell from scratch. Instead, half the family takes half the house, half the pantry, and a full copy of all the cookbooks. They wave goodbye, then carry on living as they always have, just as a separate cell with a separate fate.</p>



<p>DNA is a crucial resource, representing countless generations of acquired knowledge and wisdom. But it is <em>not</em> a blueprint, and that’s critical to how evolution works. Every cell and every organism lives an open-ended life, doing their best to survive with what they’re given. When circumstances change, life improvises and diversifies. The same genes may cause different behaviors in new contexts. When one way of living is blocked, old neglected genes may resurface, bringing back old ways of living. In stressful times, cells increase their own mutation rates, taking a risk to generate new variations which might get them out of a bind. This makes life far more flexible than if every aspect of design and behavior was explicitly laid out in the genome.</p>



<p>This becomes even more important for organisms with complex bodies. If DNA really was a blueprint, then building a human body would require precisely positioning and configuring each one of 37 trillion cells. Even if that process was 99.99999% perfect, there’d still be millions of errors. Luckily, this process is bottom-up, with each cell coordinating with its neighbors to figure out their relationships, what needs doing, and how to work together. That makes errors much more tolerable, since one cell can take over for another, or work around whatever defect is in the way. If the body were built from literal blueprints with no room for improvisation, then even a single cell out of line could potentially throw off everything that comes after. Errors would be much more likely to cascade and accumulate, potentially becoming fatal.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most astounding thing is that each cell in a body has a copy of the <em>same</em> set of cookbooks. They just read them differently, adopting a lifestyle to fit their place in the body. A bit like people in a society, each cell in the body tries to play its own role, and many different roles interact to make something much more than the sum of its parts. From many independent observations, decisions, and actions made locally by each cell, higher order structures and behaviors emerge. Cells make up organs and bodies. They manage bodily resources, capture and aggregate information about the world, and respond in coordinated ways. They perform extraordinary feats, like moving 37 trillion cells through space, gracefully and without damage.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a swarm of nanobots, clinging together to form a giant mecha. This mecha has evolved to do something useful, but its shape and function are only loosely defined. Each nanobot is a mindless automaton, operating independently within some constraints that are just specific enough for it to serve some purpose within the greater whole. These nanobots cluster to form dynamic structures, nested machines made of machines, in constant motion, building up to massive size and complexity. In order to manage this unwieldy bulk, the nanobots weave together into a neuromorphic computer. This specialized sub-processor simulates the world in real time, predicts what comes next, and carefully coordinates the timing of activity across this whole vast assemblage.</p>



<p>Part of that computer is responsible for imagining what it’s like to <em>be</em> the giant mecha. Its whole existence is within a simulated environment, extrapolated from the trillions of tiny motes of sensory data provided by the swarm. It watches the behaviors and emotions produced by the swarm, and uses them to tell stories about the values, needs, and intentions that guide the mecha&#8217;s behavior. It makes educated guesses about what the mecha will do next, which the swarm uses as hints to guide their behavior. As the only part of the mecha that is self-aware, and having no direct perception of the nanobots themselves, this simulation imagines itself to be in charge, and assumes the whole arrangement is for its benefit.</p>



<p>I know this is an uncomfortable image for many people. It’s not warm and fuzzy. It probably feels strange, maybe even disgusting. It’s not how we like to think of ourselves. However, “strange” and “disgusting” are also excellent words to describe living bodies, in all their infinite variety. Human beings are machines made of meat and bone. They are also unique souls, with meaningful lives, profound experiences, and extraordinary talents. The challenge is to see this not as a contradiction, but as two sides of the same coin. We can be the pilot in the cockpit, <em>and</em> the nanobot swarm.</p>



<p>What do you think? Is this a useful way of thinking about mind and body? Have you ever noticed moments when your body dominates your mind and the &#8220;pilot in the cockpit&#8221; illusion seems to break down? Or do you think I&#8217;m under-selling the power and importance of the brain? Is it right to say that &#8220;nobody&#8217;s home&#8221; in life without a brain, or is it more complicated than that? Any questions about this &#8220;cookbook&#8221; metaphor and what&#8217;s <em>really</em> going on in the cell? I&#8217;d love to hear from you. Please, join the conversation in the comments section.</p>

<p>(This post&#8217;s photo from the family farm circa 2004. From left to right: Tommie, Josh, and Trevor. This post&#8217;s content is inspired by conversations with vet tech, horse person, and my mother, Sandie Gaylinn)</p>



<p>My childhood home life was centered around animals. I grew up on a working farm, with cats and dogs as siblings, and a responsibility to help care for the horses, chickens, and all the rest. I had daily close contact with many animals and we formed long-lasting relationships. We grew up together, did activities together, and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. I cared for them when they were sick, and sometimes <em>they</em> would reach out to me when I was in need of comfort. Although we were obviously very different, and by necessity the animals had less freedom, I found it hard to think of them as “just” pets or livestock. They were part of the family.</p>



<p>I believe that all mammals are very similar in terms of their emotions and intelligence. This comes from many years of observation, empathy, and intuition. It’s hard for me to prove it, yet it’s harder still for me to dismiss it. Humans are more intelligent than other animals in a few narrow yet critical ways, but when I hear someone say non-human animals are “less conscious”, or that they can’t possibly comprehend the world like us, I get offended. It just seems naive, given what I’ve seen. I don’t fault others for that opinion. I assume it comes from a lack of exposure, or from human-centric bias. Of course, I have my own biases. The scientific evidence is far from conclusive, so I figure we should all keep an open mind.</p>



<p>What do I mean when I say all mammals are very similar? For one, it seems the palette of emotions is basically the same. We experience happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and pain in roughly the same way (which is why animal abuse is morally wrong). Each species has different body language, but if you pay close attention, you can learn to read their emotions quite clearly. We also respond to the world in similar ways. A sudden windfall makes us happy and excited, but it may inspire envy in others who see it. This is true whether we’re talking about humans, dogs, or squirrels. Many emotional responses seem universal.</p>



<p>Each individual has a unique personality, which means some emotions and responses are more common for them. Some folks are more optimistic, quick to anger, or self-conscious. Some less. Each species has personalities in a particular range. Dogs tend to be outgoing approval-seekers; cats are aloof and independent; horses are social, but skittish. But these stereotypes only apply on average. It’s common to see cats who act like dogs, or vice versa. There’s also a lot of overlap between species, which is why it’s easy to make friends with an animal whose personality aligns with your own.</p>



<p>When it comes to intelligence, there’s a lot more variation between species, but I wouldn&#8217;t rank animals by IQ. Each species and each individual is <em>different</em>, with unique strengths and weaknesses. Animals can be incredibly intelligent, but only in ways that are relevant to their lives. It’s unfair to judge a horse by its ability to do arithmetic, just as it’s unfair to judge a human by its ability to discriminate odors. Sadly, this makes humans generally blind to the ways animals may be more intelligent than us. We don’t tend to see or appreciate what doesn’t matter in our lives, we only see what we have in common. That makes social intelligence a good example, since many mammals specialize in it.</p>



<p>Horses are very social animals. A herd has a strict pecking order, but it&#8217;s not so straightforward as an ordered list. Their relationships can be just as nuanced, contextual, and tangled as with humans. Since horses spend so much of their time grazing, a school cafeteria feels like the right metaphor. They form cliques, with different levels of status. Some individuals move freely from table to table, hanging out with the nerds one day and the social climbers the next, while others get chased away if they try to do the same. Horses with higher status will tease, harass, and steal from those with lower status, mostly just to assert dominance. Certain foods or activities may become trendy, starting with one individual, then spreading to a clique or the whole herd. Sometimes, this is how a horse manages to climb the social ladder.</p>



<p>When a new kid comes to the lunch room, they usually get hazed. As a prey species that depends on the support of their herd for survival, horses are generally shy and cautious by nature. The newcomer knows they are at the mercy of the herd and must make a good impression, so they tend to suck it up and bear the torment. Usually, they’re welcome to join the nerd table, hanging out with their fellow losers until they work their way up the ladder. Horses with higher social status will make a point of asserting dominance at every opportunity. Occasionally, they choose to extend an olive branch instead, but this is a risky move which can have complex social repercussions.</p>



<p>At least, that’s how it usually goes. When my mom introduced Dakota to the herd, that’s what we prepared for. To try and head-off the worst of the hazing, we put Dakota in an adjoining paddock for a week. This way, the herd could get over their initial excitement, and Dakota got a chance to learn how things worked and what she was getting into. She observed the herd’s schedule, habits, and social dynamics. She saw them waiting in the lunch line and bickering over the water trough and the best grazing spots. She could see who the cool kids were, what set them apart from the others, and how they would assert themselves over the nerds.</p>



<p>When we let Dakota into the main field, we were all on hand to make sure it didn’t get out of hand, and to intervene if necessary. The whole herd quickly figured out what was going on and lined up (in their usual cliques, sorted by pecking order) near the fence to get a good look and wait their turn to pick on the newcomer. But Dakota took everyone by surprise. She stood tall and proud, walked straight up to the dominant male, and kicked him so hard it knocked him off his feet! The gelding, Johnny, couldn’t let this stand, of course. He gave her back as good as she dished out, but after that demonstration of her strength and confidence, he didn’t want to push his luck. It was over in under a minute, and the others were left so in awe of her that they’d spend the next few weeks sucking up.</p>



<p>Of course, violence was what we on the sidelines most feared. Even with no shoes on, as was the case here, a direct kick from a horse can be incredibly powerful and damaging. But we were actually relieved at what we saw. Dakota was going for dramatic effect, not injury. Her blow wasn’t very hard. She managed to hit Johnny in just the right spot with just enough force to throw him off balance. It only worked because she caught him off guard. It ended the conflict so quickly because it made him look like a fool, and shook his confidence. In effect, it was a bluff, and one that worked really well on this mild-mannered herd where even the &#8220;tough guys&#8221; were pretty gentle. A well-timed sucker punch made her look like a total badass, even though she would have lost in a fair fight.</p>



<p>It’s easy to imagine this scene in a cafeteria, but it was remarkable to see with horses, who are rarely so audacious. With one decisive move, Dakota asserted herself as the dominant female, upending the pecking order, and bypassing weeks or months of conflict and social climbing. It was smart, effective, and seemingly premeditated. She had a week to prepare. When she was led to the main field, she knew all eyes were on her. She put on her game face and acted smoothly, without hesitation. Did she reason about social dynamics and fight tactics? Did she choose a strategy and plan its execution? Or was she just improvising, driven by instinct to do what “felt right”? It’s hard to say. I&#8217;d say it was probably a blend of both, and that the balance doesn’t matter. Intelligence is intelligence. This was a smart move, regardless of where it came from.</p>



<p>I hope this is a compelling example of animal intelligence. If you’re thinking, “maybe that <em>looks</em> like a school cafeteria, but what humans do is totally different,” then I ask you to reconsider. People are very good at finding reasons for what we do. The nerds are outcasts, not because of some arbitrary social hierarchy, but because they like Pokémon and other objectively uncool things. We don’t bite one another on the flank just to inflict pain and embarrassment, like horses do. We use words and reasoning to settle disputes, like when we sling insults at each other. To me, it often feels like humans (self included) are behaving <em>exactly</em> like “more primitive” mammals. We just cover everything with a social veneer that makes it feel more sophisticated. When looking at human conflicts, I find it’s quite helpful to strip the words and meaning away and instead look at the raw power dynamics and emotions. Often that explains the situation much better than the stories people tell.</p>



<p>What do you think? Am I being too generous with animals, and seeing what I want to see? Does this remind you of another cool animal story you’d like to share? Any questions about horses that need answering? If so, please leave a comment below and join the conversation. If you want to learn more about animal intelligence, I recommend these books about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379311?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">ravens</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427380446?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">octopuses</a>. Very cool animals, far less familiar to most of us than mammals, and yet surprisingly similar in many ways.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction</h2>



<p>In the tech industry, leading a team is sometimes referred to as “programming with people.” As a novice engineer, I saw that as a cute metaphor that makes managers sound more technical than they actually are. After years of management, though, I’ve come to see it as quite literally true. In both cases, you’re trying to set up a complex system that, when left to run, will perform useful work and solve problems. The only difference is in how you define and maintain those systems. It’s a dramatic difference, though, which is why the parallels are hard to see at first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Human Machines</h2>



<p>What makes human beings unique among animals is our capacity to collaborate. Language lets us serialize ideas and pass them from mind to mind, quickly, easily, and in high fidelity. Sharing ideas lets us build systems bigger than a single person, whether that be a hunting party, a soccer team, or a company. We agree on goals, specialize in different tasks, and coordinate our strategy to form intelligent machines built out of humans. Although everything the group does is the product of individual people, the group itself has its own independent identity and can have behaviors that are totally different from what the individuals do.</p>



<p>So how do you make one of these human machines? The remarkable thing is they form spontaneously, all the time. Human beings instinctively want to socialize, build relationships, and help one another accomplish things. It’s an innate drive, built by evolution and mediated by emotions like pride, belonging, and admiration. In other words, all collaborative endeavors rely on healthy human emotions and relationships. Before we get carried away with the machine metaphor, we must remember that human needs must come first. That includes basics like compensation and healthcare, of course, but also more touchy-feely things like work / life balance, sense of purpose, a supportive community, autonomy, and growth. Providing these things is the humane thing to do, but it&#8217;s also good business. Happier, healthier, more fulfilled employees who trust and respect each other are much more productive and successful.</p>



<p>But we don’t just let teams form organically and do whatever they please. Leaders rally people around specific goals, then coordinate and direct their work. This is much harder than it sounds. One of the first things I discovered as a leader was how little control I had over my team. I could ask them to write some code for me, but it might come out all wrong if the solution I asked for was counter-intuitive to them. I could ramble on about the importance of code health, and everyone would nod in enthusiastic agreement, but that alone rarely changed anyone&#8217;s behavior. I couldn’t <em>make</em> people get along, hit a deadline, tell me what they “really think,” or hold off on sending that flippant email. Ultimately, what my team did was the product of all the people in it. Human beings simply aren’t robots who do what they’re told. Each person sees the world differently, has their own agenda, and makes decisions based on what makes sense to them. Leadership is getting people to choose to do what’s best for the team, <em>on their own terms</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Culture</h2>



<p>While computers are configured with software, humans are configured with <em>memes</em>: ideas and ways of being that we share with each other, internalize, and repeat. Each community has its own unique set of memes (its <em>culture</em>) which shapes its behavior. Culture includes the things that define a group, like the stories about who that group is and what they do, the activities they do together, and the relationships and patterns of communication with other groups. It also includes “guard rails” in the form of expectations, goals, incentives, and peer pressure that encourage good behavior and group alignment. A leader has outsize influence on a group’s culture, but in reality culture is emergent, continually being reinvented by every member of the community as they speak and act. A leader’s job is to cultivate a healthy culture, like a garden. They make an environment with rich soil and lots of light. They water the flowers, and pluck the weeds.</p>



<p>This means embracing the diverse perspectives of the team, supporting grassroots ideas, and giving folks a chance to prove themselves. At Google, my director once told me the whole department was going to focus on developer experience (DevEx) next quarter, and I should figure out what that meant for my team. A bunch of ideas immediately sprung to mind, but I decided to start with a team discussion. I explained why we were doing this, facilitated some talk about what good DevEx means, then opened the table for ideas. I didn’t start with my ideas. As a manager, my voice would overwhelm others, and my intuition was less valuable than the actual developers on my team. When someone suggested one of my ideas, it became theirs. I gave them my full support and feedback, but let them run with it in their own way. Then someone else had an idea that was surprising and unfamiliar. I wasn’t sure it would work or that the person was up to the challenge, but they were eager and confident, and a few others seemed to think the idea had potential. So, rather than sticking with the safe options, we talked about the costs and the benefits of this idea, how it might go wrong, how to prevent that, and how we could quickly test whether it was working. It turned out to be a smash hit.</p>



<p>Cultivating a healthy culture also means encouraging good habits, while discouraging harmful ones. As my team increased our focus on DevEx, we had to establish new patterns of communication. We had to deal with frustrated customers, disarm their anger, and listen deeply to their problems and feedback. We had to set healthy boundaries, making it very clear what we considered to be &#8220;not our problem,&#8221; low priority, or working as intended. We had to provide hands-on help to build trust and a reputation of competence. As a leader, my challenge was to keep up with my team&#8217;s work so I could give regular feedback, highlight good examples to share with the whole team, explain why some behavior was good or bad, and reward people in ways they found personally meaningful. I also had to be very consistent about modeling good behavior myself, but that could only go so far. I couldn’t possibly control, participate in, or even keep track of every request, conversation, or conflict. Instead, I focused on giving my team the tools, incentives, and trust to muddle through on their own. They did great.</p>



<p>Since a team&#8217;s behavior is mostly determined by its culture, one interesting consequence is that friction between teams is almost always a matter of culture shock. Each team has their own understanding of the work, their own ways of doing things, their own vocabulary, and their own sense of right and wrong. Most people aren’t consciously aware of their culture. It’s simply “how things are done.” This means it’s often surprising and upsetting to see someone do things differently. It feels like they are <em>wrong</em>, and getting in the way of your team and what&#8217;s good for the company. Misunderstandings are common. Two cultures might share a word in common, for instance, but the meaning or sentiment of that word might be totally different, in a way that neither side notices.</p>



<p>At one point, my team was building tools for our partners, who would use those tools to build user-facing products. Though we were friends working on the same code, it sometimes felt like our teams were from different planets. They used code names for major projects they were involved in, but our team didn&#8217;t know or care about. The problematic legacy code that my team was trying to eliminate and replace was their bread and butter. They had to use it <em>extensively</em> to meet their product goals, constantly adding more to the mess and getting upset when our improvements changed things out from under them and slowed down their work. We needed each other to do our jobs, but some level of conflict was inevitable.</p>



<p>As a leader in this space, a big part of my job was to act as a cultural interpreter. I lived in <em>both</em> worlds, to the extent I could. I had to align both teams on language and best practice. We had to agree on what vague concepts like &#8220;visual consistency&#8221; meant for our product, and ideally find a standard way to measure them. We had to debate priorities, which often meant figuring out how their goals might suffer if our goals weren&#8217;t met, even when they seemed totally unrelated. When conflict arose, I sat down with both sides, listening carefully, sussing out the root cause of our misunderstanding, and finding a new way to frame the discussion so we didn’t feel opposed to one another. In most cases, both sides were right and ultimately wanted the same things. The challenge was in helping everyone appreciate the other perspectives, and in turning an argument about &#8220;my way&#8221; vs &#8220;your way&#8221; into a discussion about what sort of compromise might strike a healthy balance and mitigate all our concerns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Efficiency</h2>



<p>Getting things done with diverse, independent, self-interested people can feel like herding cats. It’s the worst thing about programming with people, but it’s also the best thing. The real strength of human beings is their autonomy and creativity. Unlike computers, people will figure out how to solve a problem for themselves. They might even notice that they’re working on the <em>wrong</em> problem and choose to solve a different one instead. That’s an incredible super power, and the job of a good leader is to coax this out and make the most of it. This requires mastering some “programming techniques” that are wildly different from what works on computers.</p>



<p>One important technique is thinking in negative space. That is, in a creative project, a leader should avoid saying what <em>to do</em>, but instead focus on describing what <em>success looks like</em>. This gives each person a license, a <em>responsibility</em> even, to find their own way to a solution. This is why a leader will typically kick-off a new software team by writing a mission statement, or describing a vision for the future. Only <em>then</em> do they make a roadmap of work to do, usually with the help of the whole team. A healthy team has a clearly defined scope. Everyone knows what the team does and what they <em>don’t</em> do. The scope should be loose enough to leave room to explore, find new opportunities, and grow over time in whatever direction feels right. That’s not possible for a team defined in positive space—that is, purely based on the tasks they do.</p>



<p>On an individual level, the best way to think in negative space is to use <em>problem statements</em>. When I discover a new problem for my team to solve, I can’t help but imagine the good and bad ways to solve it. As an experienced engineer, my intuition is valuable, so it may be surprising that I make an effort to <em>suppress</em> those ideas at first. When I delegate some task, I want that person to take full ownership for the work. I want them to find a solution that <em>they</em> find intuitive, know inside and out, take pride in, resolve on their own, and take full credit for. I want to give them the chance to find a better solution than I can imagine, and permission to change strategy if they discover the first idea isn’t working. I want to let them make mistakes (safe, small ones), and learn from them. My intuition still matters, of course. It just shows up in the form of constraints and feedback. I highlight the key design factors and priorities, the challenges I anticipate, the properties that any good solution must have, how the work will be judged, and how this piece will fit into the bigger picture. As long as those things are satisfied, then it really doesn’t matter what design they choose.</p>



<p>Another challenge in working with human beings is their limited cognitive capacity. People are smart, but things like attention, will power, patience, and decision making are limited resources that can quickly be exhausted. When that happens, people make mistakes, cut corners, procrastinate, and get into conflicts. This isn’t a personal failing, it’s simply human nature. As a leader, I try to prevent that and make sure that limited, precious human brain power isn’t wasted.</p>



<p>The primary tools for this are <em>process</em> and <em>policy</em>. That is, figuring out how to do things up front, and standardizing that across the team. This includes things like checklists, frequently asked questions, form letters, bug report templates, and duty rosters. Revisiting the programming metaphor, this is actually pretty similar to how an engineer might optimize a program by moving code out of a loop, or from client to server. It’s about decoupling the work of deciding what to do and how to do it (an open ended and relatively difficult problem) from the work of actually doing the task (which is often just rote execution). The idea is to do the hard work when the team’s got the time and energy for it, not under pressure in the moment it’s needed. The planning gets done <em>once</em>, then the plan gets reused time and time again.</p>



<p>Process and policy are ways to externalize cognitive work and automate part of a team’s execution. They reduce the cognitive load and personal responsibility for each team member, but also reduce their autonomy and flexibility. That’s the polar opposite of thinking in negative space, like I advocated above. The reality is, a good leader’s job is learning how to balance these two ways of thinking, and applying them in the right circumstances. The goal is to encourage autonomy, creativity, and active thinking where it matters, and conserve those resources by using rote execution when that&#8217;s good enough. Knowing the difference is more of an art than a science.</p>



<p>There’s an interesting parallel here with biology. Life strikes a balance between cognitive power and instinct. Animals with big brains can think for themselves in the moment, taking context into account, finding new solutions, and jumping on opportunities as they present themselves. But in a life or death situation, it’s critical to do the right thing at the right moment. Sometimes thinking just wastes precious time, and opens up the possibility of doing the <em>wrong</em> thing. In those situations, instinct takes over, limiting the animal’s freedom, but preventing them from getting bogged down with a puzzle at the worst moment. Over time, intentional behaviors that work reliably can become instincts (this is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_effect">Baldwin Effect</a>). On the flip side, any instincts that no longer serve and unnecessarily limit an organism&#8217;s reproductive potential tend to be eliminated by natural selection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Well, I could go on, but that seems like enough for one post. What do you think? Does this resonate with your own experience? If you work in another profession, does this sound right or are things very different for you? Do you have more ideas or advice to share? If so, then please leave a comment below. As always, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Over the years, many books have played part in shaping my understanding of intelligence. I recently finished writing reviews for all my favorites on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144426838-nate-gaylinn">Goodreads</a>. If you&#8217;re curious where my ideas come from or want to find something new to read, check it out. Right now I&#8217;m organizing everything into four categories:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=cognitive-fiction">Cognitive fiction</a>: Fun stories inspired by science that have something to say about minds, intelligence, or human nature.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=practical-non-fiction">Practical non-fiction</a>: Tools for making sense of the world or getting things done with your human brain.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=accessible-non-fiction">Accessible non-fiction</a>: Accessible science and philosophy books written for a general audience.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=academic-non-fiction">Academic non-fiction</a>: Technical books for diving deep on these topics.</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;m reading very actively right now, so I&#8217;m adding new books all the time. I&#8217;d be happy to discuss any of these, and I&#8217;m always open to recommendations.</p>

<p>Okay, okay, enough about me. This blog is supposed to be about “intelligence,” but what does that mean? What ideas am I actually researching and writing about? In this post, I’ll try to give you a broad overview of the areas that interest me. Going forward, I’ll focus on more narrow topics, so I can explore them more deeply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-intelligence">What is Intelligence?</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most common way we think of intelligence is “what human beings do.” Even though we talk about other forms of life (and even computer algorithms) being intelligent, we tend to talk about how close they come to achieving “human-level” performance, as if that’s the gold standard. More specifically, we look to the human brain as the idealized intelligent machine. This has always bothered me, for a number of reasons.</p>



<p>For one thing, you don’t need a brain to be smart. Plants are incredibly intelligent. They coordinate their life cycle with the seasons and weather, maneuver around obstacles, communicate with pheromones, and expertly manipulate other species into doing work for them. Even in human beings, we often overlook the ways our bodies shape our behavior, rather than our brains. Our bodies make delicate manipulation tasks effortless, carefully manage an array of vital resources, perform repairs, fight disease, and have a huge influence over our moods and desires. The brain helps with understanding, imagining, planning, and deciding, but just about everything else is deferred to the body.</p>



<p>For another thing, a human being isn’t so smart without a society. So much of what we think of as human intelligence is the accumulated knowledge, wisdom, and artifacts that are better thought of as human <em>culture</em>. Those things were all created by human beings (over a few hundred thousand years), but most people aren’t constantly inventing new ideas, they’re adopting ready-made solutions, often without full understanding. The remarkable thing is that people can share and remix ideas, which allows the limited intelligence of our brains to reach further. Without access to culture, we’re not much better off than other mammals. This is clear from “wild child” accounts, which show that an infant growing up in isolation will end up tragically stunted, traumatized, and unable to adapt to life in society.</p>



<p>So if intelligence is <em>not</em> human brains, what is it? Tentatively, I think of intelligence as “the ability to adapt effectively to environmental challenges.” In other words, intelligence is <em>learning</em>. It’s about observing reality and using prior examples to choose actions that will hopefully lead to the best outcome. Sometimes this is intentional (like when a person decides what to do) and sometimes it’s more of a blind process (like when natural selection preserves a behavior because it just happens to be adaptive).</p>



<p>My perspective is that all of life and culture is produced by a complex learning process. Or, more precisely, life is a system of learning processes that make learning processes that make learning processes. Our global society and ecosystem together make up one enormous web of intelligent agents, filling many roles and operating at many scales. This is not a new idea. There are whole branches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">Complex System Theory</a> devoted to the emergence and complexification of life. I’m reading about that prior work, and thinking about how it relates to my experience in algorithms, computer systems, and organizations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="life-as-computation">Life as computation</h3>



<p>One assumption that I’m making is that life can be thought of as a kind of computation. This may be hard for some to swallow, since computers as we know them today completely lack so many of life’s wondrous qualities. I’d argue that’s because of two essential differences. Firstly, life is solving a completely different problem than computers do. Organisms are born into the world with a body, and challenged to survive as best they can in an open-ended environment. In contrast, most computer systems are tools for people, designed to perform specific tasks on demand. Of course they behave quite differently. The second difference is sophistication. Our engineered computer systems are incredible, but life still puts them to shame in terms of complexity, nuance, and efficiency.&nbsp;That’s not surprising, given life’s multi-billion-year head start.</p>



<p>When I say life is computation, what I really mean is there is nothing <em>supernatural</em> about life. As strange, beautiful, creative, and unpredictable as life is, I assume that this is ultimately the result of physics. Very particular arrangements of molecules interact in reliable ways to reproduce, perpetuate, and refine patterns of behavior we see as intelligent, without the need for any outside influence. This assumption is mostly out of practicality. Science can’t explain magic, so to give science a chance at this problem means entertaining the idea that there is no magic.</p>



<p>In Computer Science, there’s a concept called the “universal computer,” first proposed by Alan Turing. In a thought experiment, he designed a very simple machine and showed that it could run any computer program you could imagine. More importantly, he showed that <em>any</em> machine that has a few key properties is equivalent to the one he designed, and can <em>also</em> perform any arbitrary computation. In other words, computers come in all shapes and sizes. Each one has unique performance characteristics, which make it better suited for solving some problems than others, but at least in principle any universal computer can run any possible program.</p>



<p>That’s why I find the model of computation so appealing for natural intelligence. In life, there are many different kinds of intelligent systems, built very differently, with different specializations, functions, and performance characteristics. But as long as there’s no magic, then there’s some mechanical process under the hood producing these behaviors, and that’s computation. More importantly, if we can describe all these systems using the same language, we can compare them directly with each other, and talk about how they compose to form larger, more complex systems. The language of computation is general and expressive enough that I think it can do the job.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-kinds-of-intelligence-exist">What kinds of intelligence exist?</h3>



<p>Our world is filled with an enormous diversity of intelligent systems, many of which have their own dedicated fields of research. There’s cell biology, evolutionary biology, ecology, neuroscience, psychology, sociology, computer science, and many more. Specialists study one intelligent system, in the context of a particular academic discipline, using the tools and language of that discipline. This narrow focus is very valuable, but it means our understanding of intelligence is siloed, and we tend to categorize intelligent systems based on what academic field studies them, rather than their computational properties.</p>



<p>To advance our understanding, we must learn to see past the obvious differences of these systems and the unique, messy ways they manifest in nature. Instead, we should focus on what they have in common. What properties are broadly shared by many kinds of intelligence? What questions can we ask about all intelligent systems, and when we look at the answers, how do we compare apples to apples? I’m not at all sure how to do this, but there are a few properties that already stand out to me as interesting places to look:</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Substrates</strong>: What is the fabric this intelligence is built from? Molecules? Neurons? Transistors? People? What can that tell us about the strengths and weaknesses of that system? For instance, cells are molecular machines and thus constrained by the limitations of chemical processes like diffusion and catalysis. This severely limits the computational speed and physical size of cells, but it also provides a remarkably robust, efficient, and massively parallel form of computing that engineers can’t yet rival.</li><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: What information is available to learn from? For instance, natural selection is almost completely blind. The only signal of success is when an organism reproduces. On the other hand, humans have rich sensory perceptions and a wealth of knowledge and experience, all of which factor into cognition. The level of visibility affects what kinds of patterns a system can recognize, and how quickly it can find a workable solution to a problem.</li><li><strong>Purpose</strong>: What function does this intelligence serve? For most computer systems, a human decided the purpose in advance, then designed one particular solution to fulfill that need. On the other hand, many forms of intelligence are far more open-ended than that. Living things, human organizations, and even some forms of AI will strive to creatively fulfill their purpose, sometimes doing so in surprising ways. This can be very tricky, since a system&#8217;s &#8220;purpose&#8221; often isn&#8217;t clear, and can change over time.</li><li><strong>Interface</strong>: Within a substrate, there are no clear boundaries. The genes for digesting lactose are spread ambiguously between you and your gut bacteria, for instance. But boundaries between substrates are much sharper, because the parts are made of different stuff, and are not naturally interoperable. At these edges, there are narrow interfaces between intelligent systems, sharing just enough information from one to another that they can work together. That gives us a natural window into what properties of a system matter most for fulfilling a particular function.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<p>What I want to do here is to find useful ways of dividing up the world that might serve to integrate, compare, and contrast our notions of intelligence from different domains. I hope this will help to identify parallel examples, and to discover insights that can transfer from one domain to another. Life has evolved an incredible variety of learning processes, each optimized in different ways. Surely there are new algorithms and performance tricks waiting to be discovered. Perhaps we could even derive some general design principles for what learning tools work best under different constraints?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-does-life-compute">What does life compute?</h3>



<p>So, if all of life is one big, complex computation, what is it actually computing? In one sense, the answer is simple: life constructs ecosystems of organisms, and optimizes them to reproduce and thrive. That’s a fine answer in the abstract, but our experience is much more specific than that. Life is typically a &#8220;yes and&#8221; sort of process. Any successful way of doing things tends to stick around, and in doing so it shapes everything that can come after. In other words, life on planet Earth isn’t just “thriving” in some generic sense, it’s found a very particular way of doing that which we must study if we want to understand, predict, and influence its direction.</p>



<p>To make this more concrete, think about modern American society. We use GDP as a (flawed) proxy for human thriving. We use capitalism and an ecosystem of corporations to redistribute resources and prioritize work so as to improve GDP. Those corporations are made out of people, who run the company, make the decisions, do the work, provide the services, buy the products, and use them in  their daily lives. Those people have minds which are deeply embedded in cultural roles (citizen, employee, parent, etc.) and physical bodies, all of which have their own goals, limitations, preferences, and demands that tug the person in multiple directions at once. People are just one species, but we depend on countless others, which depend on each other and on the physical world, which is changing more rapidly than ever thanks to the power of human culture.</p>



<p>That system as a whole does things we want (like providing a comfortable standard of living for many) and things we don’t want (like instigating global climate change). It’s flawed, but we can’t start over from scratch, we can only try to steer it in a positive direction. That means understanding the structure of the system, and finding the points of high leverage, where a small nudge will have a big impact (and hopefully few side effects). To fight plastic pollution, should we invest in ocean clean-up, tell individuals to change their purchasing habits, tax corporations for plastic waste, or engineer plastic-eating bacteria? It’s hard to say what will work best, but if we can understand the major players, their incentives, and the ways they learn and adapt, we can make better educated guesses.</p>



<p>Describing and explaining all of life on Earth is impossible. It’s just too big, messy, complex, and rapidly changing, but that doesn’t bother me. The same is true of the source code for Google Search, but I worked with that system effectively for years. How? By using the engineering concept of a system architecture. If you know the major parts of a system, what they do, and how they fit together, you can say a lot about that system as a whole and navigate its subsystems with confidence. Of course, whatever model you make will be a huge oversimplification with many exceptions, but even a very rough model is profoundly useful.</p>



<p>This may be a pie-in-the-sky idea, but I’m fascinated by what a system architecture for life on Earth might look like. Could we really describe it all in one big picture? Could it be organized and subdivided in meaningful and useful ways, or is the real world just too messy? Could we use that model like an engineer does, to trace the steps leading to some behavior, identify the relevant subsystems, and make targeted interventions to change the system’s behavior?</p>



<p>More practically speaking, I’m interested in how intelligent systems compose with one another, even just two at a time. For instance, nascent research has shown great promise in using evolutionary algorithms to design architectures for deep learning. I hope that studying the relationship between mind and body might provide insights into how to integrate deep learning systems into other software, and how to balance the costs and benefits of intuitive thinking with other algorithms and heuristics. I’m also very interested in understanding the impact of social software and machine learning on society, and how to build software systems that conform to human values and ethics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>



<p>That’s a brief tour of the intellectual domain I want to work in. I’m well aware it’s an enormous territory, and I surely won’t get to it all. My plan is to take a broad but shallow pass over many examples of natural intelligence, and to go deep on my study of computer algorithms and machine learning. I hope this will allow me to take full advantage of my technical skills and spend time searching for practical innovations that show the value of this way of thinking. In the meantime, I can work towards a general theory of intelligence in the background. It&#8217;s fine if I never get there, it&#8217;s just good to have lofty aspirations.</p>



<p>That said, all of this will surely change as I make progress. I’m figuring this out as I go along, and making course corrections all the time. I’m still learning about prior work, and I’ll have to adapt my own work to complement it. I’m not sure what ideas will prove to be dead ends, or what surprising new questions and opportunities I&#8217;ll discover along the way. That’s a good thing. I want to keep an open mind about this work, and let it evolve into what it needs to be. Still, I hope these questions will be a fruitful place to start.</p>



<p>I also have more ideas I didn’t cover here. I’ve got lots to say about evolution, so much so that it deserves its own post. I have many thoughts and observations about the inner workings of the mind. I’d love to explore the consequences of these ideas on how we understand the human condition, the structure of society, and conventions for the ethical AI. Frankly, this is such a big domain, there are so many places I could go, and I intend to follow my passion and curiosity.</p>



<p>As always, I’m very interested in feedback. Does what I said make sense? Do you have questions? Do you disagree, or have other ideas to share? Got advice on how to make this research more productive? Did I touch on something you’d like me to explore in more depth in a future post? If so, please leave a comment. I’d love to hear from you.</p>
