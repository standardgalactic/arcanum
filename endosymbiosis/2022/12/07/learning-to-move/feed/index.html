					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/12/07/learning-to-move/comment-page-1/#comment-106&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

You bring up a good point about walking being easier than it seems. Every body is shaped just so to make the common movement patterns as effortless and reliable as possible. This gives the cerebellum a lot of &quot;hints&quot; and makes it hard to screw up too badly! Originally this post was going to cover &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; the cerebellum &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; how the body itself learns to move, but that was way too much for one post. I may revisit the idea later, and this would be a good tidbit to include!

How does the cerebellum learn? Probably a lot like the rest of the brain, actually. There are some ways in which all neural networks are quite similar. Neurons that fire together wire together, which build networks of associations, which get adjusted based on feedback. The big difference is that the cortex has all these extra self-referential loops of analysis, which allow for more thoughtful behavior but also slow things down a lot. The cerebellum monitors itself and its signals, but it &lt;i&gt;doesn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; contemplate what that means, what the consequences might be, whether there&#039;s a better way, or how the future will unfold more than a few moments out. It&#039;s got a much tighter feedback loop, is incapable of &quot;overthinking&quot; things, and can act very quickly without conscious thought. Like, when you casually brutalize a wave of microbes in Dr. Mario with nightmarish speed and precision, while your mind is focused on a pleasant conversation with a friend.

Is paying attention strictly necessary to learn? Maybe not 100%, but it certainly is if you want to get &lt;i&gt;really good&lt;/i&gt; at something.

I&#039;m particularly interested in how things that make us smarter in real time &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; make us better at adapting over evolutionary time. I think that&#039;s really cool and important, so I&#039;ll always bring up examples like that when I see them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[O the balancey body.  I have seen commentary from some thinker of the past that learning to walk upright is the hardest thing anyone can learn.  I dunno about that!  It does take young humans a while, but they&#039;re also developing in other ways.  Yes, there&#039;s a lot of tent poles to balance atop each other, but we have a lot of controls for managing them, too.  Like standing a tower of blocks but molding it carefully flush with your hands.  And you have dozens of hands.

I haven&#039;t played QWOP, but I&#039;ve seen it and its sequel CLOP in action.  This is an interesting lesson to take from the game.  I find it crazy sometimes how fast my fingers can move when I&#039;m typing or playing Dr. Mario (which I&#039;m a demon at) or when I knew how to play a fancy song on the piano.  I find it almost offensive.  And skilled piano players do offend me because it seems like what they do should be impossible.

You&#039;ve made me wonder how the cerebellum learns!  I wouldn&#039;t think it would be necessary to pay close attention to your movements to learn how to habitually move in certain ways.  I&#039;d think just doing it would be enough, but thinking about it could certainly help.  I can&#039;t think of any reference examples from my own experience.  But a negative sort of example is that I can&#039;t seem to stop myself from performing habitual gestures (like pressing on certain sorts of my body in an accustomed way as a sort of fidget) unless I can identify the specific harm it does, and then I can force myself to stop.  Eventually I managed to stop bending one finger in my sleep when I had persistent trigger finger, and it worked, when other treatments failed.

You have pointed out an interesting fact about evolution: that body part adaptations would often be useless or detrimental instead of useful if there weren&#039;t a lot of plasticity on the brain&#039;s part regarding them.  &quot;What am I supposed to do with these leglike fins?&quot; asks the mutant fish.  &quot;These are stupid.&quot;  But instead, it tries them out and finds them handy.  And now I know it&#039;s thanks to the cerebellum!]]></description>

That&#039;s a great point, Mike! Thanks for bringing that up.

I wasn&#039;t thinking in those terms, but what you describe is actually a big motivation for this blog as a whole. A human being is a complex system, and only a small part of it is consciously accessible. Learning about the parts you can&#039;t see, how they influence you, and how you can influence them is super helpful for getting the most out of your mind and body. This is the sorta stuff I wish came in the human being user manual, but since that doesn&#039;t exist, I&#039;ll write about it in my blog.]]></description>

This brings to mind some of what I was reading about meditation a couple of years ago... that just because a process is unconscious doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t train it. If you can figure out a way for your conscious mind to &quot;reward&quot; yourself (e.g. through calling to mind things with positive emotional associations, or even just by paying attention to something you would normally have ignored), you can very gradually adjust how that unconscious process works.]]></description>

You didn&#039;t miss it, it just came out!  :)

In ones sense, I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a long time. I&#039;ve always been interested in the brain, and the cerebellum is a notable part. I was always curious about how some animals start off life being able to move and some don&#039;t, or about people learning how to walk again after brain damage. It&#039;s fascinating stuff.

Practicing yoga and getting physical therapy for an injury helped me see another perspective, though. I was never very athletic, so when I started learning to use my body I was shocked by what I didn&#039;t know. For instance, I never really thought about the idea that you can perform the same gross movement using completely different sets of muscles, and you can learn to control which muscles you use. That&#039;s obvious in retrospect, but really blew my mind. I was just &quot;walking,&quot; what do you mean I&#039;m overusing my quads to do that? Similarly, I didn&#039;t like to exercise because it &quot;made my body ache.&quot; Gradually I learned there&#039;s a whole language of sensations that muscles use to describe their state (stiff, warmed up, tired, flexed, over-flexed, stretched, over-stretched, injured, repairing / growing, etc.) and you can learn to differentiate which individual muscles are sending those signal. Again, mind blown. Just by paying close attention, I turned this vague, ambiguous signal into something so much more precise and meaningful. Nobody could teach me that skill, because every body is different, and there&#039;s no way to describe those sensations. That&#039;s when I really began to think of the cerebellum as &quot;a mind of its own&quot; that you had to attend to and interrogate if you want to understand it.]]></description>
