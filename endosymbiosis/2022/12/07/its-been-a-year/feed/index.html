Thanks! I really appreciate your comments and conversation. Ideas are so much richer when interrogated and seen from new angles. That said, it&#039;s not all intellectual mumbo-jumbo for me. I&#039;m looking forward to quiet cozy time with friends this December. Here&#039;s to cookies, eggnog, and classic movies. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your posts are always a savory, calorie-rich treat to read.  Way to keep up te blog so far, and congrats on the awesome evolution-analyzing programming project!  You have so much on your mind, it&#039;s admirable.  I&#039;m thinking of holly and mistletoe with berries and ornaments as I think of the year&#039;s end, and fire in a fireplace and warm things to drink and company in the background.  Enjoy the end of your year!]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve enjoyed it! I really appreciate your engagement and support. It&#039;s been a huge help.

Thanks for the book suggestions. The book on strategy sounds very interesting. It may not be my focus at the moment, but I&#039;m absolutely fascinated about the art of organizing groups of people to get things done. As computational units, human beings are so complex, subtle, unique, and independent... yet our superpower is collaboration, and we do the most extraordinary things together. Hopefully I&#039;ll return to leadership again in my career&#039;s future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your blog (and other activities) have been really fun to follow this year. My own reading has dropped off a bit since the summer, but I&#039;ve been trying to understand what is meant by &quot;systems theory&quot;. That exploration has been disappointing, in illuminating ways. &quot;Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters&quot; (not ostensibly a Systems book) was really quite good, and I&#039;m finding &quot;An Introduction to General Systems Thinking&quot; pretty good as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Nate.  Keep it up.  Also, thank you for sharing your reading list.  Mine is a bit more casual.  But, we do have a handful in common (Hitchhikers, Fire upon the deep, Dawkins, Flowers...).  Excited to learn where you are headed in the spring.]]></description>
