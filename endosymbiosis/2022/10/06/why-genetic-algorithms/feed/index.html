I like how you talk about life and human minds as the two great sources of complexity.

You&#039;re right, my rule of thumb that DL imitates people while GAs discover novelty isn&#039;t quite right. It&#039;s an over-simplification, for the sake of clarity. Alpha Zero is a great example. It&#039;s actually using an algorithm called Deep Reinforcement Learning, which is distinct and combines useful properties of both. Machine learning is a rich and complex space. My hope is to add something new and useful to the mix, and to shine a light on some underappreciated aspects of biological intelligence in the process.

I would love to share my research with my family over the Thanksgiving table. Nothing goes better with pumpkin pie than tech demos! Except maybe whipped cream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So... Deep Learning is when people know how to do something and we&#039;re training a machine to imitate us... and Genetic Algorithms are when we want to harness the power of nature to figure it out instead?  That makes sense, as it mirrors what I sometimes think of as the two sources of awesome complexity in the universe--the life that evolution produced, and the minds that living experience produces.  (One could also add in things like geosystems and stable astronomical systems, but eh!)  Yet, it&#039;s confusing, since you credit Deep Learning with success at AI game playing, and indeed I think of Alpha Zero and other chess- and go- playing systems as examples of Deep Learning.  Yet they not only exceed what we humans can teach them, but are able to learn things without being taught by people--my understanding is that they learn through experience.  Playing millions or billions of games until they develop their own strategies nobody ever taught them.  That sounds more like a genetic algorithm to me!

I didn&#039;t know about AI being used in architectural and engineering design.  That&#039;s nifty!

Using GAs to design DL algorithms?  Gee, smart stuff is complicated!  I wonder how that would look.  But I&#039;m definitely excited to hear about your pioneering genetic programming work when it&#039;s done enough to have produced some results.  Thanksgiving continues to feel like a great time for that, for no obvious reason.  I imagine sitting on a super thick cushioned chair with some family sitting around and chatting... sipping creamy coffee while digesting my meal, and you call us into the computer room to take a look at something resembling the Game of Life... and it gives us newfound awe for all that is alive. :-)]]></description>

It&#039;s good to hear from you, Michael, and I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re feeling better. It&#039;s strange doing this work without sharing it with my father, but I take comfort knowing that this exciting path is only possible because of all he taught me and the values he instilled in me.

I&#039;m not sure if a GA would be the right tool for the problems you describe, but I&#039;d be happy to learn more about it and try to find out. Let me follow up with you over email.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Nate:  A truly exciting initiative.  I spoke to Sandie yesterday and was pleased to hear your news.  I often think of Bruce and join you in mourning the great loss.  I know Bruce would have had many suggestions for you.  I would love for GA to be applied to all the different metabolic, endocrine and cytokine pathways to understand what controls appetite and how it could be modulated.  Similarly for insulin resistance.  I have many ideas that I would love to discuss with you when you are ready and have time.]]></description>

Great observation, Mike! I&#039;ve also noticed there are some remarkable similarities between GAs and NNs. I&#039;m looking forward to exploring the math and computer science of machine learning generally, so I can understand what makes them similar and different more deeply. It would be awesome to find a general model that encompasses both. I like the way you&#039;re trying to generalize concepts like &quot;survival&quot; and &quot;fitness&quot; to both cases. I feel like that approach has potential.

I particularly like your observation that nature uses both of these systems together. This is exactly what I&#039;m getting at when I talk about multiple layers of intelligence, or combining evolved programs with neural networks. I think a lot of the nuance and sophistication of natural intelligence comes from combining multiple strategies with different strengths and weaknesses, either working together in complementary ways, or dividing labor according to specialization. Hence why I&#039;m so frustrated with the single-minded focus on deep learning.  :-P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You describe GA as &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, but in a lot of ways neural network training is _also_ a process that can be described as &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. The difference is in how the different agents (genome vs. neuron) vary relative to one another, and how they are rewarded.

In a neural network, there is a lot of positional variation (how the neuron is connected to others) but very little behavioral variation (what the rules are by which the neuron acts). &quot;Fitness&quot; is also positional, in that rewards that are available locally to one neuron are generally not available to another neuron elsewhere in the network, given identical behavior.  The &quot;reward&quot; for fitness is increasing&quot;influence&quot; in the network - license to produce outputs with greater amplitude. &quot;Survival&quot; is expressed as &quot;retaining influence&quot; and &quot;Death&quot; is expressed as &quot;influence that has dwindled to nothing.&quot; In biological networks (neural or otherwise), linkages and cells that lose influence ultimately loose resources and literally die.

In a genetic algorithm, the variation is largely in the behavior of the agent, and agents may not have any meaningful position at all relative to one another. &quot;Fitness&quot; is more of a broad filter that applies evenly across all agents in the system. The reward for fitness is is not survival, but reproduction, another form of &quot;growing influence&quot; in the system.

Natural ecosystems involve _both_ forms of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;: both the situational/accumulative (relativistic?) form and the behavioral/reproductive (universalist?) form, working in combination.]]></description>
