					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/07/06/mindfulness-and-the-default-mode-network/comment-page-1/#comment-65&quot;&gt;Michael Demko&lt;/a&gt;.

At least for now, I&#039;m avoiding overtly spiritual topics on this blog. I figure that would alienate many readers. Instead, I want to focus on my first-hand experience and the arguments I can support with reason and facts. That said, I love to speculate about the spiritual consequences of these ideas, and would be happy to discuss them privately.

To respond to your comment, meditation is often used as part of a spiritual practice, and has its origins there. It&#039;s not &lt;i&gt;religious&lt;/i&gt;, though, which makes things confusing since religion and spirituality are often very mingled together. There&#039;s also the scientific perspective on meditation, which focuses on its impact on the brain and body, since those are the things we can measure. This has led many folks to use meditation for wellness. Apparently it&#039;s good for people even with all the spiritual aspects stripped out.

I guess the interesting question is: what&#039;s the relationship between the physical body and the soul / spiritual self? How does one affect the other? Are they even real, separate things, or just two ways people describe the same reality? That&#039;s pretty metaphysical, so I doubt science will ever have a definitive answer, but I think the practice of meditation is a good way to explore this for yourself. When you look inward, what do you see? How do you name it? What does it mean for you? There&#039;s no wrong answer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/07/06/mindfulness-and-the-default-mode-network/comment-page-1/#comment-63&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

I definitely don&#039;t want to imply that folks &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to do yoga or meditation or whatever. I want to share my observations because I found them useful, but it&#039;s not meant to pressure or impress anyone. I agree with you that some people are more naturally reflective and aware of their own minds than others. For folks like that, I think the value of meditation is about more subtle things, like getting more practice observing and influencing specific activities happening in the mind.

You said, &quot;We are made by the world, and not by ourselves.&quot; I really like that! My point is just that our culture tends to set the mind apart from the body and the world by default. There&#039;s even a tendency to treat any irrational or unjust behavior or any lapse of control as a personal failing, which is problematic. I&#039;m trying to promote an alternative view, which you seem to already have. I&#039;m amused that when you tried to write about minds constructing themselves and a sense of identity from raw ideas, you found them to be pretty human. I think that says a lot!

I talked about the DMN very superficially here, and I&#039;m not an expert.  If you&#039;d like to learn more, I found two helpful YouTube videos, one from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cto2yr5NQY&#038;ab_channel=ThePsychedelicScientist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;neuroscience perspective&lt;/a&gt;, and one from a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNicQ1i6dz4&#038;ab_channel=LewisPsychology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;psychological perspective&lt;/a&gt;. The DMN is doing something fairly complex and subtle, and it is different from person to person, yet it creates very distinct recognizable patterns of activation that we can spot in fMRI scans. I think the big take-away is that rather than being totally open-ended and consciously directed, the brain is structured to produce and choose between very specific modes of thought that were useful in our evolutionary past.

Dismissing thoughts is hard, yet there are meditation gurus who say they&#039;ve mastered the skill to the point where thoughts simply don&#039;t come up unbidden at all! I find that hard to even imagine. One thing I&#039;ve noticed from observing my own mind is that thoughts don&#039;t always form all at once. They can start faint and abstract, and then take a moment to expand and elaborate themselves. Attending to a thought is a sure way to encourage its growth, so one (very challenging) trick is to notice a thought &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it&#039;s fully formed and to look away before it has the chance to get started. Aside from that, though, I find changing topics, like you say, is the most effective. If a thought keeps coming up repeatedly, then it may be better to act on it instead. That can be more disruptive than rumination, but if you can prevent it from coming up again and again, you might spend less time on it overall.

&quot;What is the self?&quot; is a difficult philosophical topic I&#039;ll surely explore more in future posts. There are lots of well-informed takes out there already (for instance, Damásio&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427378803&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Self Comes to Mind&lt;/a&gt;). Thanks for sharing those examples, though, I think they mesh really well with what I&#039;m saying here. The brain produces lots of semi-random stuff when dreaming, day-dreaming, and brainstorming. Sometimes it&#039;s the seeds of artistic genius, creative problem solving, or insight into the psyche. Sometimes it&#039;s cheese-eating circus fleas negotiating a mortgage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Meditation is something I&#039;ve never really tried, unless you count following a set of instructions in a guided meditation about hobbits.  I can&#039;t say I know how one meditates, exactly, but I suspect it&#039;s not a complicated thing.  And I&#039;ve read a bit about it, including the &#039;monkey mind&#039; concept versus the mental silence concept.  Yoga, I also haven&#039;t tried much, just a couple led sessions at conventions that I wasn&#039;t able to keep up with.  I was trying so hard to figure out how to copy the instructor&#039;s motions (looking at someone while bending around is hard) that I certainly didn&#039;t get any meditation-like benefit.

But I reflect on stuff a lot, and I think a lot of meditation benefits come to me naturally.  That includes thinking about stuff going on in my life, but also being aware of my own thought process, my own body, and so on.  But I do resonate with the experiences you describe of obsessing over things to an unhelpful degree and sometimes being unable to focus.  I think of myself as absent-minded.  It makes it tough for me to follow movies unless I&#039;m able to pause them and rewatch parts if I started letting my thoughts drift.

&quot;...it’s been unsettling to learn how much of what my mind does is because of outside factors, like the way my brain is built, the situation I’m in, and my experiences growing up.&quot;  Are these really outside factors?  This is just how having a mind works.  If these are outside factors, what counts as an inside factor?  Making a conscious effort to think about X for a while?  That&#039;s kind of an uncommon situation.

We are made by the world, and not by ourselves, and so everything about us is going to be due to some outside factor, and in most cases you don&#039;t have to go back far at all in the chain of causality to reach the outside.  The idea of creatures that created themselves and designed themselves is fascinating to me because it would get around this uncomfortable truth.  So I included a society of such beings in a NaNovel I worked on recently.  The idea is that these beings are logically sound arguments, curried into sentience by specialist caretakers and then able to design their own minds and bodies as they unfold further.  But I was a little surprised to find that the idea of creatures having created themselves as much as seems even logically possible didn&#039;t seem to make much difference in terms of creating interesting story tidbits around them.

I hadn&#039;t known about the Default Mode Network!  It&#039;s interesting.  &quot;There are a few specific brain regions that activate in a distinctive pattern, which is generally consistent across people and cultures,&quot; you say.  Maybe I&#039;ll look up what the pattern is.  I&#039;d imagined that the natural way the mind wanders was less organized than that.  That systematic cycle... is that something we can even observe happening?  It&#039;s interesting sometimes when I look back on my train of thought after letting my mind wander for a while, and some of the links are funny to contemplate once I realize what they were.

And yes, it sounds like &#039;monkey mind&#039; is in fact the same thing as the DMN, and that it is a part of &#039;human programming.&#039;  The questions you ask about new thoughts seem worth asking--it seems like perhaps the hardest of them would be to banish a thought or line of thought that you don&#039;t want.  You can&#039;t not think of a pink elephant, after all.  I&#039;d think the best remedy would be to choose something else more productive that you actually want to think about, and leap into that, but have you found a better way to get rid of unwanted thoughts?

&quot;I am not my mind. I have a mind. It feels good to merely exist in my body, with no thoughts at all, even if that rarely happens.&quot;  I haven&#039;t felt this way myself, yet.  I still feel like saying that I -am- my mind is pretty accurate, if perhaps a little misleading.  I respect that thoughts happen on different levels, some of which are subconscious, and that&#039;s pretty cool.  Sometimes it&#039;s bizarre and funny and amazing, the things I subconsciously come up with, which I notice most in dreams and just after waking.

&quot;When my DMN stirs up thoughts, I needn’t attend to them if I don’t want to.&quot;  This reminds me of how a friend of mine (the one with the animal farm I mentioned in another post) once had a revelation: he doesn&#039;t have to process the stuff he comes up with in his dreams.  There is no obligation to lie in bed and think about dream stuff until it resolves... because it&#039;s junk!  Well, maybe it&#039;s not really junk, but it rarely sticks around.  It may seem obvious, but for both him and me, letting the thoughts dreams churn up go feels wrong and is hard to do.  That may reflect many people&#039;s experiences with waking thoughts churned up by a naturally wandering mind.]]></description>
