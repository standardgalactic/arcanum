					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/11/02/emotions-and-cognitive-resonance/comment-page-1/#comment-95&quot;&gt;Nate Gaylinn (he/him)&lt;/a&gt;.

You say the mechanism and experience of thoughts and emotions are so different... I don&#039;t really know what makes them different?  I guess they utilize different parts of the brain?  Maybe emotions are mainly chemical levels and thoughts are synaptic firing?  It&#039;s muddy for me, though.

Emotions can&#039;t just be the states our bodies are in that determine what behavior our bodies engage in, since we need full-formed thoughts in order to make a lot of decisions.  If I want to pick up the phone on my desk, I don&#039;t do it by forcing myself to feel strongly enough about picking it up that my hand just automatically reaches out.  I make a decision specifically to pick it up, usually for a reason.  But the description of emotions as motivators makes sense.  They can somehow alter the mental pathways we pick to explore.  Do they do it by being swift-moving gatekeepers--so that we encounter a choice but very quickly reject it because our emotional state isn&#039;t right for it at that moment?  Do they help us in the nitty-gritty process of piecing potential courses of action together?  Well, they must do both, but what can we describe as their primary role in the working of the mind?  It&#039;s tricky to say.

I&#039;ve never been convinced that there are a lot of purely rational decisions to be made out there, or even close to a lot.  It reminds me of writing or rhetoric or science classes that talk about inductive versus deductive reasoning, and I have trouble finding examples of deductive reasoning that are really deductive all the way through.  Examples of rational thinking are sometimes given as properly valid logical arguments, but that kind of thing is a tiny mental step and very rarely anywhere near the sum total of a decision.  I think the kinds of decisions people call &quot;rational&quot; are really decisions that have a relatively high amount of rationality stirred into the sea of thoughts and emotions the decider has to sort through.  

I know a lot of people wonder about who they really are... how complete and integrated a person you can be given that you change a lot over time.  The point that we also behave and think a lot differently when our moods are different figures into that too.  But I don&#039;t find that the idea of my &quot;true self&quot; is very important to me.  I like the idea that a person has a healthy, relatively neutral state that we call their &quot;right mind,&quot; and that if you&#039;re not in your right mind, you can&#039;t be held as responsible as if you are, since it&#039;s reasonable to think that most of the actions a person will take in the future will be in their right mind.  But at best, the right mind is just a mostly stable thing, not rock-solid and forever constant.  And if we&#039;re being more realistic, a person&#039;s right mind is a whole spectrum of minds that stem from them being in all the various normal moods that people enter into.

&#062; Is anger clearing away a false shading of “fluff and sunshine,” or is it adding a tinge of “cynical and sinister” that may or may not be present?

That&#039;s a good question.  It&#039;s not as if a normal &quot;clear-headed&quot; state is strictly emotionless, since I would say we need some kind of emotional reaction to possible outcomes we imagine from our actions in order to decide between those actions.  So, what is a clear-headed state closest to: my angry self, my complacent self, my sad self, or some other version?  I like the idea that being clear-headed all the time wouldn&#039;t actually be healthy, but rather that we need to experience various moods now and then in order to clear out various kinds of dust.  Anger can clear out complacency, but it spins its own sinister cobwebs that have to be flushed in turn.]]></description>

Those are some lovely thoughts. Thanks for sharing! I like your musing about what emotions even are. I agree with you about the messy ambiguity of it all. I take a stance in this blog post, but I hardly feel like I have &quot;the answer.&quot; At best it&#039;s &quot;an answer,&quot; but emotions are incredibly multifaceted.

I like the idea that emotions provide guidance for decision making. So often, choosing the right behavior is about imagining how it would make me and others feel, both now and later. Even very rational or ethical decisions, which don&#039;t seem like they ought to be overly emotional, are often resolved by feelings of satisfaction, confidence, pride, or shame. You can &quot;do the math&quot; as rigorously as you want, but what options you consider, the constraints you impose, and how to balance competing factors are usually grounded in what &quot;feels right.&quot;

Personally, I wouldn&#039;t call emotions &quot;half baked thoughts,&quot; just because the mechanism and experience of thoughts and emotions are so different, but I think I see what you mean. To me, their more like &quot;motivators.&quot; They make me uneasy, pushing me to act, seek, avoid, reconcile, or resolve. They tell me vaguely which direction to go, and my brain interprets what that means and figures out a plan for how to do it. So, I think we&#039;d both agree they often serve as vague, unconscious &quot;seeds&quot; for more structured, intentional thought processes.

It&#039;s interesting how dramatically your recollection and your self story shifts with mood! I&#039;ve had similar experiences myself. It raises some interesting questions about how the self is constructed and who you &quot;really are,&quot; doesn&#039;t it? Is your &quot;true self&quot; all of the facets, even if you&#039;re only keenly aware of a few facets at a time, given your mood? Or is your &quot;true self&quot; fluid, constantly changing with your mood and your behaviors? Is anger clearing away a false shading of &quot;fluff and sunshine,&quot; or is it adding a tinge of &quot;cynical and sinister&quot; that may or may not be present? Or is it both? If you don&#039;t regret something you did when you were angry, is that because you would make the same decision again with a cool head, or just that you have a cognitive bias to agree with your past self? Interesting questions to ask, but difficult to answer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Emotions are a challenging topic, aren&#039;t they?  We all know more or less what they are from early childhood, when we&#039;re told about them and shown situations and facial expressions to match them, so that we can start to understand and express how we&#039;re feeling... but do we even agree at all at what emotions *are*?  You talk about modes of behavior resulting from bodily states, including &quot;hunger, arousal and fatigue,&quot; without calling those emotions... and indeed, some people would call hunger an emotion, while others wouldn&#039;t.  I remember _A Wrinkle in Time_ (or maybe its sequel) making a big deal over the idea that love isn&#039;t an emotion, but something more fundamental.  Love is usually something with a target, not just a state that exists in a vacuum--is that what makes the difference?  Is liking something an emotion?  Is hatred an emotion?  If hunger, arousal, fatigue, sleepiness and other such feelings are directly connected to the body&#039;s state, what can we say by contrast about those that aren&#039;t?  Classics like sadness, jealousy, delight, disappointment... are connected to what?  Our imagination of what could be or could have been?

And what are they when described physically?  We know certain hormones and neurotransmitters can cause certain emotions, but it doesn&#039;t seem right to say emotions are made of hormones and neurotransmitters.  It&#039;s probably most accurate to say emotions are brain-states, but you might split hairs and call them the emergent result of certain brain states.  Emotions are related in certain well known ways, but not reliably.  So, what *are* they?  Just the name for certain general ways we feel?

I used to think of emotions as half-baked thoughts.  Like thoughts that haven&#039;t been fully formed yet, something like free-floating cellular molecules waiting to be connected into proteins.  But sometimes I think of emotions as the toolkit of intuition, the way we let our intuition influence us.  Or I see emotion as the sea that rational thought swims around in, or as the system of gauges that our decision-making processes, along with other influences, use to measure the desirability of potential actions.  There are a lot of different non-scientific models for the role emotions play in our mental experience.

What you say about being in an angry mood certainly resonates.  Sometimes I&#039;m in an ashamed mood, and it&#039;s amazing how many memories I can manage to find at those times of things I&#039;m embarrassed about.  If I had to list ten embarrassing moments from my past right now, it would be a challenge, but there are times when I&#039;d just have to wait a couple minutes and I&#039;d have plenty such moments available for me to groan in shame about.

When I&#039;m in a super angry mood, it seems kind of hard to imagine that my anger at things could be invalid, even if I know my angry mood comes from something totally unrelated.  Maybe it&#039;s just a case of denial, but I like to think at such times that anger isn&#039;t so much clouding my judgment as clearing a window, letting me see things without the fluff and sunshine that normally ornaments every issue.  Sometimes it lets me decide to throw out some malfunctioning thing or unfriend someone online that feels past overdue, and I rarely regret such decisions later.  Then again, one of the important lessons a child or adolescent growing up has to learn is that lashing out at people is very rarely useful beyond the short term.  Maybe that&#039;s because a big part of anger is evolutionarily miscalibrated for the modern world.  Certain other emotions like anxiety may be as well.

It is useful to know why you&#039;re feeling a certain way.  I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s often being sleepy, even if that sleepiness isn&#039;t obvious.  Hunger can also be a stealth cause.  A source of fear or anxiety or anger that seems small can actually be large, even if one is embarrassed to admit the large effect it&#039;s having.  The method you describe seems useful for figuring out the cause of one&#039;s emotional state.  Finding the most salient idea among many reminds me of trying to pinpoint the origin of things elements from one&#039;s dreams.]]></description>

I like that. It helps to clarify that the primary purpose of emotion is to motivate and direct our actions.]]></description>

Another thought that came to mind: One model for emotions that I&#039;ve seen (especially in relation to dog training) is to break an emotional state into two components: arousal (how urgently should I act) and valence (am I getting a good thing or avoiding a bad thing).]]></description>

Thanks. Yeah, I think our society often doesn&#039;t take emotions seriously, especially in more male-dominated, technical fields where Vulcan logical purity is the ideal. The problem is, intentions can&#039;t override biology. Insisting that you are above and beyond emotions just means you&#039;re blind to what&#039;s happening in your own body / mind, and powerless to do anything about it. I guess that&#039;s pretty similar to the idea of &quot;race blindness,&quot; actually.

I think your simulation example is really cool! I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a coincidence that you and nature both landed on a similar design. The efficiency factor you mention is surely relevant for life, too, but I think the root cause is different. The first living things (and even modern life at the smallest level) were quite blind and stupid. They could only perceive the environment in very limited ways, and had no awareness of the strategies and tactics they used. So, using an environmental cue they didn&#039;t understand to switch between evolved heuristics that just happened to be effective was the best they could do! From that foundation, more complex, self-aware, and adaptive strategies could be built, but that simply wasn&#039;t possible in a single cell.

Your situation is very different. You have the option of using the full state of the simulation and the full computing power of your workstation to make decisions at every level, you just choose not to for efficiency.

Another interesting question that I&#039;m not sure what to do with yet: what&#039;s the difference between an automaton&#039;s state and an emotion? I drew the comparison because I think it&#039;s interesting and useful, but surely they&#039;re not identical.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like how you came at this topic. Although a lot of people seem ashamed to admit it, I am increasingly convinced that most people who have had a lot of success in their careers invested many years into understanding and working with their emotions, as a precondition to that success. People simply do not come into life prepared to respond appropriately to the specific stresses of our technocratic world.

A project that I&#039;ve worked on, off-and-on for many years now ,is this fairly convoluted social simulation. What I&#039;m finding, as a practical engineering strategy, is that it is useful in this context to have multiple (very different) decision-making algorithms for different types of activities - where should I move next? what should I eat? who should I trade with? how much should I offer them? when should I fight vs. run? who is important in my environment?  From a runtime performance point of view, I can&#039;t afford to run all of these algorithms all the time. I need a &quot;strategic function&quot; to decide which specialized algorithms to run in any given context. My ideal AI (for this application) is a two-layer system: the first layer decides what to prioritize (strategy); the second layer runs specialized logic to make a fine-grained decision to advance that priority (tactics).  Video game NPC AIs often have this same architecture: each NPC is a state machine, and the NPC makes decisions based on very different logic depending on the NPC&#039;s current state. It isn&#039;t a big leap to just name the states &quot;emotions&quot;.

Is the analogy reasonable? I&#039;m not sure. But it certainly is tempting.]]></description>
