I think you&#039;re right that it depends a lot on what kind of job we&#039;re talking about. My experience is in a creative field, and I&#039;m sure things are different elsewhere.

I hope society can come to see employee stability and satisfaction as one of the important things that a company produces, to be balanced with productivity as appropriate. It seems ridiculous to maximize output and profits at the expense of &lt;i&gt;everything else&lt;/i&gt;, but that&#039;s what happens when you define success so narrowly.]]></description>

This is an interesting point!  It&#039;s easy to say that happy employees are productive. but there are various ways that being made unhappy at least in the short term can spur productivity.  I use some of those without even having to be managed.  Like saying &quot;Oh my gosh you&#039;ve been in bed twelve hours, you have to get up now!&quot;  I may not want to get up, or finish something by a deadline, or restrain myself from eating before bed, or work instead of play, but I&#039;ll definitely be more productive if I do.

Then again, I wouldn&#039;t set those constraints and rules for myself if I didn&#039;t think they&#039;d increase my happiness in the long run.  Maybe one can say that employees allowed to be happy in the long run are more productive, even if they&#039;re forced to work harder than they&#039;d like in the short term.

But is that really true?  It would be nice if it were true.  I suspect it&#039;s more true the more freedom and creativity the employees in question have in their jobs.  It seems very believable to me that for straightforward, menial work, the way to get the most output is to ride the workers close to the edge of what will make them quit.  Which is why that&#039;s so often how its done.]]></description>

Interesting point about how this is a bit like what a collaborative artist does! Software engineering is definitely a creative activity, so we use a management strategy that is designed to bring out that creativity in people. I&#039;m not sure how different it is in less creative jobs.

I love your examples of Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and colonial insects. I think that&#039;s really apt! Most people think of programming in the &lt;i&gt;procedural&lt;/i&gt; sense (that is, a program is a sequence of instructions). What you and I are talking about here is &lt;i&gt;constraint-based&lt;/i&gt; programming. In that model, the programmer describes the high-level properties and requirements for the system and lets the compiler (or person, or worker bee) provide the low-level implementation.

I think you point out an important point when you say many things work like this, but few can be told what to do. In some sense, all of life (and even some non-living systems!) are like constraint-based programs. The physical world provides constraints, and these systems find ways to work with those constraints to self-perpetuate. Humans and computers are special in that they get some of their constraints from explicit programming, rather than just the environment. That difference is what makes them capable of rapid and dramatic change.

I also love your game metaphor. In a sense, human culture is all about games. In a company, for instance, each job role is like a game. You are taught a certain way of looking at the world. This is your game board, or your heads-up display. There are rules to follow, valid and invalid moves, players to interact with, points to score, etc. What&#039;s most interesting is that companies tend to make &lt;i&gt;nested hierarchies&lt;/i&gt; of games. As you gain experience and get promoted to roles of greater responsibility, you learn to play new, more complex games. You coach people on your team to play the games you&#039;ve already mastered, while to you these people become like &quot;units&quot; in your RTS. And, of course, your whole team is a &quot;unit&quot; to the next manager up, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So you set process and policy, craft mission and vision, reign them in with negative space shaped with your intuition, sit down and listen, turn us and them into we, standardize words, define priorities and present problem statements.  That doesn&#039;t sound so much like programming to me.  It sounds like a multimedia artist!

Maybe it&#039;s like programming like how in a video game about clashing civilizations, you may not directly command your forces to build a fort or gather wood, but rather set rules about how many people should gather wood or what buildings need to be built, and let your people sort out how they do it.  Or maybe how a hive of bees or a hill of ants may &#039;program&#039; its priorities into the nature of the insects that do the guarding and childrearing and honeymaking and foodseeking.  I would suggest that a lot of things are like this, but not many things can be set in motion and told what to do; maybe just people and computers.  So I guess in a way, that&#039;s what programming is.

As for letting others have their ideas and cultivate them before you share your own (and sharing your own only if you need to), that reminds me of video games in a different way--namely, watching someone play one when you already know how to win.  You can give hints when they&#039;re stuck, but it can be even neater to watch their ideas flourish and then reflect their thinking with your own gentle nudges, perhaps not unlike a curtain of negative space.  You did that for me in Outer Wilds and I&#039;ve done it for others before. :*]]]></description>

I do like the gardening metaphor! But there&#039;s also the side of designing the right scope and cultural narratives to get the job done, and constantly refactoring the culture to optimize the process. It&#039;s like programming, except that nothing stays the way you made it for long. It&#039;s also like gardening, except not every garden has an objective.

I hadn&#039;t heard of the neural model, but that also makes sense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m super familiar with the kind of thinking you are describing here (probably not a coincidence :P)

I personally prefer to think of this as &quot;gardening&quot; rather than &quot;programming&quot; - you can&#039;t force a plant to grow, but you can make growth more or less possible, and you can kinda guide it in one way or another. And a great garden is one that is a community rather than a set of isolated plants. Now of course, that&#039;s a very aesthetic framing, and says nothing about &quot;successfulness.&quot;

I also like a sort of neural model in organizations: relationships are formed or dissolved very organically depending partly on whether project progress is facilitated, partly just on personal preferences. And managers can help or hinder that formation of relationships for various purposes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/programming-with-people/comment-page-1/#comment-30&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;.

You bring up an important point, Dan. There are many ways to define success, and I would argue some of them are deeply problematic. What I mean is, on average, happy well-supported people do better work. But there are other ways to extract &quot;better work&quot; from people that are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the people&#039;s best interest.

A classic example from the software industry is measuring an engineer&#039;s performance in terms of volume of code written or number of bugs fixed. Those can be useful metrics for a team&#039;s productivity, but if you make that the goal, it creates perverse incentives (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Goodhart&#039;s Law&lt;/a&gt;). Either consciously or not, people begin to game those metrics, writing long-winded code and filing superfluous bugs just to close them. Those who focus on quality over quantity are punished for it. The numbers go up, but the quality of work goes &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt;, and the employees hate it. 

I feel like your examples are similar. Yes, surveiling employees and preventing them from organizing (like Amazon currently does, for instance) can improve certain performance metrics. It may even be better for a company&#039;s stock price, in the short term. But my feeling is that if you look at the big picture, this is almost certainly worse. It hurts people&#039;s lives, of course. But from the company&#039;s perspective, it hurts employee retention, institutional knowledge, HR and recruitment costs, reputation, and more. Notice that playing the numbers game tends to improve things that are easy to measure, by shifting the losses into things that are much harder to measure.

I guess the behavior I&#039;m advocating is to focus on people rather than numbers. If you support and empower your employees, and link their thriving to the company&#039;s thriving, the numbers will go up. If instead you focus on pumping up your numbers, it may look better on paper, but it&#039;s certainly worse for humanity and probably worse for your company, too.

<p>You bring up an important point, Dan. There are many ways to define success, and I would argue some of them are deeply problematic. What I mean is, on average, happy well-supported people do better work. But there are other ways to extract &#8220;better work&#8221; from people that are <i>not</i> in the people&#8217;s best interest.</p>
<p>A classic example from the software industry is measuring an engineer&#8217;s performance in terms of volume of code written or number of bugs fixed. Those can be useful metrics for a team&#8217;s productivity, but if you make that the goal, it creates perverse incentives (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" rel="nofollow ugc">Goodhart&#8217;s Law</a>). Either consciously or not, people begin to game those metrics, writing long-winded code and filing superfluous bugs just to close them. Those who focus on quality over quantity are punished for it. The numbers go up, but the quality of work goes <i>down</i>, and the employees hate it. </p>
<p>I feel like your examples are similar. Yes, surveiling employees and preventing them from organizing (like Amazon currently does, for instance) can improve certain performance metrics. It may even be better for a company&#8217;s stock price, in the short term. But my feeling is that if you look at the big picture, this is almost certainly worse. It hurts people&#8217;s lives, of course. But from the company&#8217;s perspective, it hurts employee retention, institutional knowledge, HR and recruitment costs, reputation, and more. Notice that playing the numbers game tends to improve things that are easy to measure, by shifting the losses into things that are much harder to measure.</p>
<p>I guess the behavior I&#8217;m advocating is to focus on people rather than numbers. If you support and empower your employees, and link their thriving to the company&#8217;s thriving, the numbers will go up. If instead you focus on pumping up your numbers, it may look better on paper, but it&#8217;s certainly worse for humanity and probably worse for your company, too. Of course, a big problem here is that our current economy <i>strongly</i> incentivizes companies to pump the numbers, so it&#8217;s no surprise that they do.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You wrote: &quot;Providing these things is the humane thing to do, but it’s also good business. Happy, healthy, fulfilled employees who trust and respect each other are much more productive and successful.&quot;

What, exactly, do you mean by &quot;successful&quot; here? I suppose a lot depends on the context. For example, surveys say that surveillance cameras at work make employees unhappier, as compared to no cameras are installed to keep tabs on them, but studies also show that worker productivity goes up when employees are being monitored at work, even if it makes them &quot;unhappy.&quot; Slacking off at work makes many employees happier; and being held accountable for their time on the clock makes them unhappier.
Unions might make employees -- take, cops, for example -- feel more &quot;fulfilled,&quot; by they also tend to make them worse at their job (e.g., decreasing their accountability).]]></description>
