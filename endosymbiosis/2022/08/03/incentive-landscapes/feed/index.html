					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/08/03/incentive-landscapes/comment-page-1/#comment-69&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;re right that many jobs have very limited flexibility. The concept of incentive landscapes is less visible in that situation, but I think it&#039;s still very relevant. A leader can give direct and specific orders to a team, and they can fire anyone who doesn&#039;t comply. That makes some pretty strong incentives for the employees that are hard to resist! But you can&#039;t make quality or productivity go up by telling people to work harder. If you suspect some folks aren&#039;t doing their job, how do you find out which ones? If you do find out, and you do fire them, then you have to find, hire, and train a replacement, which takes time, effort, and money. Not to mention the damage they could do to morale on the way out, especially if they are loved by their peers. Sometimes there are strong incentives &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to fire someone, even if by policy you should. So, even for an absolute dictator with no concern for the well-being or freedom of their charges (as in the work camp example Michael brought up in another comment), there&#039;s a surprising amount of give and take.

Actually, the visual redesign and infrastructures colliding was not a big surprise. I simplified the story a bit for the blog post because it was getting long, but leaders were well aware, and the only real surprise for me was what exactly the redesign project looked like. It&#039;s a common practice at Google to create parallel projects with related goals and opposing perspectives. In this case, it was a good way to make sure the infrastructure team didn&#039;t get carried away with designing the perfect traffic light, but instead focused on tasks that would have concrete, user-facing benefits. At the same time, it forced the redesign team to be mindful of the mess they were making, clean it up after, and use their experience to make sure future parades go more smoothly. It&#039;s actually a very effective leadership strategy, and I might write more about it in the future.

You make some good points about racial equity. A big part of the problem is that credentials can be misleading. For instance, a white man from a wealthy family who went to a fancy prep school will find it relatively easy to get a degree from a prestigious University. Does that mean they are competent? Well, hopefully, but it&#039;s certainly not a guarantee. It&#039;s tempting to go easy on them and not pay close attention because they&#039;ve already been vetted, but then you might not notice their mistakes. In fact, the same thing could have happened to them in college. Grade inflation is a serious problem.

Also, there are plenty of women and people of color who &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have impressive credentials and who &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; have a hard time succeeding. It&#039;s not like leaders review a person&#039;s resume before a design review. They tend to go on a gut feeling. Folks that look the part, find typical solutions, and present their ideas with familiar language tend to sail through the review process. It&#039;s much harder for people who stand out, or whose work stands out, as different. They get more criticism and may not be taken seriously. In fact, women commonly complain about bringing up a good idea in a meeting, having it passed over, only to have a man bring up the same thing five minutes later and get rewarded for it! That sort of thing probably isn&#039;t intentional, it&#039;s just a matter of what folks subconsciously pay attention to.

I love the comparison between source code and the legal code. I think it&#039;s very apt, and I 100% agree that we ought to create incentives to keep laws simple, easy to understand, up-to-date, relevant, and minimal. Unfortunately, the incentives seem to be the exact opposite of that, and look at the result! Yikes. As you say, though, changing this would be hard, because leaders have such different perspectives on values, goals, and how to shape people&#039;s behavior.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You have a lot more leadership experience than I do, but it seems to me that leading in terms of an incentive landscape is something of a luxury, or an unusually high-level concept.  It seems to require a working team with lots of room to decide what to work on at any time, as opposed to a more pedestrian one where a manager assigns certain people to certain projects and just says &quot;This is what you have to do&quot; along with perhaps some input from the workers about how and where they&#039;d like to be assigned.  I kind of think that&#039;s what most job leadership looks like in practice.  Together with setting rules about how things should be done.  One could frame a traditional role like that in terms of an incentive landscape, but it would involve simple features like &quot;If your numbers are too low, you&#039;ll be warned, then fired.&quot;

Well, maybe I&#039;m being naive or missing subtle points.  And maybe it&#039;s true that most job leadership, like a store owner seeking workers, looks like that, but that&#039;s not the kind of leadership you&#039;re interested in.  The existence of incentive landscapes is the important thing for your research, I guess, and not how prevalent it is.

It&#039;s funny and a bit odd to think of one team redesigning the Google search page, and another team redesigning its infrastructure, whatever that is, and the two teams initially being unaware of each other.  It sounds like some higher-level leadership dropped the ball, really, in failing to get your teams coordinated from the start.  And it&#039;s even kind of hard to imagine from the outside how that happened.  I guess you knew about the existence of the adjacent team in advance of their announcement, just not that they were planning a redesign, as opposed to just maintaining the search page?  Well, I wonder if they knew about your efforts at all, and whether they expected you to just continue with your streamlining even during the metaphorical parade, which it seems was maybe even more like a permanent thing than a parade is.  Like a change in the design of the parking spaces and hydrant location without telling the sewer workers.

Regarding racial equity, it seems to me that if you&#039;re making an effort to hire more people from a group less likely to have traditional credentials, it makes sense that their work would be scrutinized more thoroughly, even aside from whatever bias the supervisors might have toward the group.  Traditional credentials are designed to more or less guarantee that the people you hire can do the type of work you want.  If you&#039;re hiring people based less on those credentials and more on things like apparent potential or outside-the-box accomplishments, that represents more of a gamble, and it makes sense to test such gambles to see if they&#039;re paying off.  But even if that oversight is justified, it has to be taken into account when deciding how hard to push for the likes of racial equity.

Regarding code health, it seems like it might be hard to enforce.  Some problems in bad code you could automatically detect, but some would be really hard to find, I imagine.  It&#039;s good that the infrastructure team started rewarding the clean-up work.  I wish the body politic or someone else would reward that kind of thing for the legal code.  But yes, as you pointed out, the art of legislation seems to fit the incentive landscape model well.  Or perhaps lawmaking styles vary between those who believe in carefully tailoring an incentive landscape and those who perhaps believe more in basic moral principles, whose theoretical landscape might have more solid walls and jumps than a pragmatist&#039;s.]]></description>

True, most of my leadership experience is from Google. It&#039;s hard separating the particulars of what I&#039;ve seen from general truths about the world. Could you clarify which parts stood out to you as Google-specific and which parts seemed so universal that they also show up in a book about forced labor camps?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Google (and Search in particular) may be a bit extreme in their organizational culture. The kind of leadership style you describe is present, but not (I think) the dominant style in many organizations.

At the other extreme, if you can tolerate the horror of the subject matter, Solzhenitsyn&#039;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; goes into considerable detail about how even in a very extreme system of subjugation of some people to the power of others, negotiation and incentive engineering remain pervasive. (This is a theme of the book, but certainly not the only one - I don&#039;t want to leave the impression that &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; is primarily about incentive structures).]]></description>
