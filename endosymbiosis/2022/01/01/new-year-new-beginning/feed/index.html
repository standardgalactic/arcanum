Hey, thanks for reaching out! Interalia does look super interesting, thanks for sharing. I found some of your work online, and it&#039;s also very cool. I&#039;ll be in touch if I see a good opportunity for collaboration. Certainly, it seems like we share an interest in evolutionary algorithms and data visualizations. Have you ever explored things like cellular automata or turing patterns for inspiration? They&#039;re a little different from your other pieces, but for some reason they strike me as conceptually adjacent to your work with evolving patterns in imagery and music.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Nate. Tia here. Just met you at the Synapse mixer. Interalia magazine is about art, science, and consciousness. May be of interest to you. I&#039;ve done some cross-disciplinary projects with evolution/music/infographics and have an interest in neuroscience and psych. If you want to chat, get in touch.]]></description>
