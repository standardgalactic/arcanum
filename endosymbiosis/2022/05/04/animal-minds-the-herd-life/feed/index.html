It&#039;s nifty to hear firsthand impressions of the social behaviors of fowl, water and otherwise!  I watched some wild ducks fighting today.  I can very much imagine these birds showing these patterns and emotions.

We introduced gerbils to each other in the same way--separating the two halves of the cage with a wire mesh for a few days so they&#039;d get used to each other, particularly their smell.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing! These are lovely examples. I actually felt kinda bad focusing on mammals since birds and other species are also very intelligent, but this post was already too long...

As you know, I&#039;ve always preferred the nerd table, and probably always will!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have less experience with nonhuman mammals, but I can vouch for the fact that chickens, ducks, and geese all have similar behaviors to what you described. I‚Äôve seen several examples of ducks, in particular, demonstrating compassion (which I would characterize as quite a complex emotion!), as well as surprisingly astute intimidation tactics (establishing dominance by sticking close to a rival while foraging, following them from place to place, and in general openly watching them until they took the hint and joined with another group). Chickens, of course, establish quite a literal ‚Äúpecking‚Äù order. My family actually used a similar strategy in introducing new chickens to the flock as you described with the horses, setting up fencing so that the flock could see the newcomer (and vice versa) before being able to directly interact, which seemed to reduce fighting when the newcomer did join. And, as has been mentioned already, chicken communication has nuance! I‚Äôve definitely seen a flock jump to attention when a rooster called, look at the sky and all dart back to the barn to avoid a hawk.

I do have to object to your cafeteria analogy of the nerds as the losers‚Äô table, though‚Ä¶..we were totally the coolest kids and you know it. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/animal-minds-the-herd-life/comment-page-1/#comment-43&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;re full of interesting ideas, as always! Thanks for sharing. There&#039;s lots I want to reply to.  :)

Let&#039;s start with the horses. Life in a horse herd isn&#039;t all drama and fighting. For the most part, it&#039;s quite peaceful and fun. Teasing and harassment are common, but like in a school cafeteria, they&#039;re usually pretty mild and folks mostly get along despite it. Even the nerds get to eat and run and play with everyone else. It&#039;s just that everyone is socially aware, has a reputation to maintain, and must show deference where it is due.

On our farm, most of the horses lived in one big field adjoining the barn, the house, a road, and some woods. You&#039;d think there wasn&#039;t much to do, but that&#039;s a great example of humans not seeing what matters to other animals. There was a lot of variety in how the horses would spend their time. Grazing was actually several different kinds of activity, depending on what foodstuff they were after. For horses, literally anything is potentially food. They will taste every grass, fruit, tree, fence, and water trough trying to find the best stuff. To the untrained eye, their pasture looked like undifferentiated green, but to them there was an enormous difference between clover, crab grass, and plantain. They learned which plants were delicious, which were gross, and which were more trouble than they were worth. They knew where different patches grew, when the herd ate there last, and who gets first claim when the plants grow back. Discovering the first patch of clover of the year would be a real boon for a horse, and an ethical dilemma: do you sneak a choice meal out of turn and hope you don&#039;t get caught? Or do you alert the whole herd, even if that means you only get the leftovers?

Beyond grazing, there was watching the humans at the barn, watching the cars go by, socializing with the cats on the fence line, running for joy, playing chase, exploring the woods, rearranging the water troughs... the horses had &lt;i&gt;plenty&lt;/i&gt; of things to do. What surprised me most was that the behavior of the herd overall would change dramatically depending on power dynamics. If one of the popular horses (call them Pat) liked to patrol the fence, they might lead the whole herd on daily circuits around the property. But if another horse (let&#039;s say April) discovered a patch of fermenting apples, the herd might ditch patrol duty for a delicious boozy snack. Pat would lose social status and feel pressured to win it back. He might try to bully April and take over as king of the apples, but that might backfire if the herd saw him as a needy jerk. He might join the apple trend, deferring to April and biding his time for the season to change so he might reassert himself. He also might fall out of favor and never get the herd interested in patrolling again.

Did Dakota get frustrated and impatient being separated from the others? Perhaps. I was very young at the time, so I don&#039;t remember those specific details clearly. In general, though, in this situation most horses would be nervous and apprehensive. Being alone is uncomfortable for a horse, and the main herd would be constantly watching her, calling out to her, judging her, and showing off. The herd&#039;s display is meant to be intimidating, and the newcomer would be pressured to always be &quot;on&quot; in order to impress the others. That&#039;s why we gave them a week to cool down and relax a bit before putting them together. As you say, it&#039;d be really interesting to know how she was really feeling (was the bravado real, or just an act?), but I guess we&#039;ll never know.

How similar are mammals, really? I admit, I over-simplified a little in my blog post for the sake of clarity. Emotions are part of an animal&#039;s body, and every species has a very different range of bodies and emotions. My real point is that we&#039;re much more similar than different. Many other species across the animal kingdom seem to be strongly emotional and in similar ways to us. I focused on mammals because I thought they&#039;d be relatively uncontroversial. The farther you get from us in the family tree, the more different species seem, and the harder it is to see parallels. I didn&#039;t want to argue about where to draw a line between species that &quot;have feelings like us&quot; and those that don&#039;t, mostly because I don&#039;t believe such a line exists, or that humans should judge other species by how similar they are to us.

I think comparing animals to young children like you do makes a lot of sense. Before we&#039;ve absorbed our culture, people are much more like other animals. Just, keep in mind that children learn culture &lt;i&gt;very quickly&lt;/i&gt; and without being explicitly taught. Once we learn the human stories about how to think, how things work, and why things are the way they are, our understanding of the world becomes much deeper and more complex than what animals have access to. We see past what is physically there to an imagined world of meaning that took our species collectively tens of thousands of years to uncover, describe, and accumulate. I believe animals are capable of similar feats of learning and comprehension as people, it&#039;s just that they&#039;re limited to what they can learn on their own, by observation, in a single lifetime. They aren&#039;t dumb. They just can&#039;t share their hard-earned knowledge and wisdom with each other nearly as effectively as people do, and so they don&#039;t get the enormous head start that we&#039;re privileged to.

I love your experience with Gerbils! That&#039;s really cool, and it brings up another interesting point: human orientation. Some animals are very interested in human activities, and will engage with us in ways that seem very intelligent. Dogs are the prime example of this, and that should be no surprise: we made them that way through thousands of years of training and selective breeding. Some other species just don&#039;t care about humans or the human world that much, which may make them seem dumb, antisocial, or incurious. Things would look very different if we could see them in their natural habitat, though. Every species engages very deeply with their lifestyle, their home environment, and (often, but not always) their kin, with strong instincts tied to particular objects and experiences they&#039;re likely to find there. The problem is, people rarely get to see that, since we spend our time in very unnatural environments, and our very presence is usually a huge disturbance to other species!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[O horse.  Hello you cafeteria creatures.  I&#039;m glad to understand more of the horse social dynamic thanks to this post!  I agree with the cafeteria analogy, and I&#039;d say that it also sounds a lot like I hear things go in prison.  (After all, they were are captives.)  It&#039;s neat to read about how Dakota judged her situation and claimed her place in the social ladder.  The existence of the social ladder you describe actually surprised me a bit.  I&#039;ve never lived on a farm, but I have the image of herd animals in a paddock or pen just largely hanging out doing not much, with only occasional conflicts.  I hadn&#039;t really thought about there being cool places to eat and &#039;nerd tables&#039; for the outcasts.

I&#039;m curious what the trendy foods or activities were that you observed!  How many activities did they even have to choose from?  I have a little trouble imagining making the observation that a horse has climbed the social ladder because everyone&#039;s started adopting its trend.  It sounds pretty fascinating.

Are mammals all emotionally similar?  That seems reasonable to me when I think about it, though I was surprised to find it seems right.  What are the most extreme mammals that might disprove it?  Elephants?  Batty bats?  Platypuses?  Pangolins?  Some mammals are solitary, which I think is a pretty significant emotional difference, but they could compared to old grumpy hermits.  In general, we milk-suckers love snuggling up to mom and maybe siblings, and that makes us empathetic and lovable and loving in some deep down way.

But what about the bitty mammals with bitty brains?  What about shrews and mousies?  You get offended, you say, when people say &quot;they can‚Äôt possibly comprehend the world like us.&quot;  Hmm.  I often compare the reactions of smarter mammals, like dogs, to humans doing cultural/technological things, to the reactions of children watching adults do those same things.  I can remember being a child well enough to get into the mindset.  There&#039;s a sense of trust that these people know how to do basically inexplicable things, but maybe I&#039;ll understand when I&#039;m older, and for now they owe me certain basics like food, attention and love.  These adult creatures are people like me despite their godlike knowledge, and we are on good terms with each other, and I just have to wait for them to be done being adult humans.  So.  Smarter mammals, it seems, regard us like our own children do.

But what about Mongolian gerbils?  My family used to keep and breed these when I was a child and teenager.  My mother kept documentation of our family trees and I helped her work out the color genetics, along with various mailing lists and newsgroups on the relatively young internet.  So while I never lived on a farm, I had extensive exposure to dozens of adults of this one species of mammal, plus hundreds of juveniles that we sold to pet stores.  We definitely noticed that some of them were more intelligent than others.  And they had personalities--bright, placid, grumpy, daring, friendly, skittish.  But... did they comprehend the world like us?  I think there were some big pieces missing from their intellect.  If they watched us, I believe it was just in anticipation of us possibly picking them up or giving them food.  They didn&#039;t show curiosity in humans doing human things.  I don&#039;t think they knew one of us from another, or at least they didn&#039;t seem to care.  Some of them loved getting picked up to go on adventures (wouldn&#039;t you if you lived in a cage?) and I was even able to train a few to climb up my arm with the excitement of it.  But I don&#039;t think they loved us as beings apart from the opportunity we represented.  They loved each other as companions, mates, parents and children, but I think their empathy and comprehension didn&#039;t go much beyond that.  And gerbils are considered among the most intelligent rodents of their size, putting hamsters to shame.

Your statement about envy regarding windfalls reminded me of reading about how corvids are cautious when they see someone watching them bury food, but squirrels don&#039;t show the same awareness, and someone decided that means they probably don&#039;t have a theory of mind, at least not of humans, i.e. they don&#039;t realize we&#039;re things with goals and desires like them.  But then I searched the web, and I found that people actually have observed squirrels being cautious about burying their nuts--using a fake-burial behavior much more often when they&#039;re being observed.  Maybe it&#039;s just instinct, but it seems to establish that squirrels do have a theory of mind after all.  Well how about that!  They are cuties.

I don&#039;t blame you for not ranking animals by IQ!  IQ is a fraught enough measurement tool even for us humans, and we invented it for ourselves!

As for Dakota&#039;s specific approach, I find it very interesting.  &quot;Did she choose a strategy and plan its execution? Or was she just improvising, driven by instinct to do what &#039;felt right&#039;?&quot; you ask.  I agree that it can be and probably was a combination.  I imagine that she was frustrated at being corraled off from all this social action for a week.  Her frustration may have built and built, and maybe when she kicked Johnny, she was festering from the frustration of being kept out of the arena for so long, on top of whatever resentment or social strategy she may have built up around him for that week.  I do really wonder how she would have described her feelings if she had the words!

Thank for the really interesting post!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>O horse.  Hello you cafeteria creatures.  I&#8217;m glad to understand more of the horse social dynamic thanks to this post!  I agree with the cafeteria analogy, and I&#8217;d say that it also sounds a lot like I hear things go in prison.  (After all, they were are captives.)  It&#8217;s neat to read about how Dakota judged her situation and claimed her place in the social ladder.  The existence of the social ladder you describe actually surprised me a bit.  I&#8217;ve never lived on a farm, but I have the image of herd animals in a paddock or pen just largely hanging out doing not much, with only occasional conflicts.  I hadn&#8217;t really thought about there being cool places to eat and &#8216;nerd tables&#8217; for the outcasts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious what the trendy foods or activities were that you observed!  How many activities did they even have to choose from?  I have a little trouble imagining making the observation that a horse has climbed the social ladder because everyone&#8217;s started adopting its trend.  It sounds pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>Are mammals all emotionally similar?  That seems reasonable to me when I think about it, though I was surprised to find it seems right.  What are the most extreme mammals that might disprove it?  Elephants?  Batty bats?  Platypuses?  Pangolins?  Some mammals are solitary, which I think is a pretty significant emotional difference, but they could compared to old grumpy hermits.  In general, we milk-suckers love snuggling up to mom and maybe siblings, and that makes us empathetic and lovable and loving in some deep down way.</p>
<p>But what about the bitty mammals with bitty brains?  What about shrews and mousies?  You get offended, you say, when people say &#8220;they can‚Äôt possibly comprehend the world like us.&#8221;  Hmm.  I often compare the reactions of smarter mammals, like dogs, to humans doing cultural/technological things, to the reactions of children watching adults do those same things.  I can remember being a child well enough to get into the mindset.  There&#8217;s a sense of trust that these people know how to do basically inexplicable things, but maybe I&#8217;ll understand when I&#8217;m older, and for now they owe me certain basics like food, attention and love.  These adult creatures are people like me despite their godlike knowledge, and we are on good terms with each other, and I just have to wait for them to be done being adult humans.  So.  Smarter mammals, it seems, regard us like our own children do.</p>
<p>But what about Mongolian gerbils?  My family used to keep and breed these when I was a child and teenager.  My mother kept documentation of our family trees and I helped her work out the color genetics, along with various mailing lists and newsgroups on the relatively young internet.  So while I never lived on a farm, I had extensive exposure to dozens of adults of this one species of mammal, plus hundreds of juveniles that we sold to pet stores.  We definitely noticed that some of them were more intelligent than others.  And they had personalities&#8211;bright, placid, grumpy, daring, friendly, skittish.  But&#8230; did they comprehend the world like us?  I think there were some big pieces missing from their intellect.  If they watched us, I believe it was just in anticipation of us possibly picking them up or giving them food.  They didn&#8217;t show curiosity in humans doing human things.  I don&#8217;t think they knew one of us from another, or at least they didn&#8217;t seem to care.  Some of them loved getting picked up to go on adventures (wouldn&#8217;t you if you lived in a cage?) and I was even able to train a few to climb up my arm with the excitement of it.  But I don&#8217;t think they loved us as beings apart from the opportunity we represented.  They loved each other as companions, mates, parents and children, but I think their empathy and comprehension didn&#8217;t go much beyond that.  And gerbils are considered among the most intelligent rodents of their size, putting hamsters to shame.</p>
<p>Your statement about envy regarding windfalls reminded me of reading about how corvids are cautious when they see someone watching them bury food, but squirrels don&#8217;t show the same awareness, and someone decided that means they probably don&#8217;t have a theory of mind, at least not of humans, i.e. they don&#8217;t realize we&#8217;re things with goals and desires like them.  But then I searched the web, and I found that people actually have observed squirrels being cautious about burying their nuts&#8211;using a fake-burial behavior much more often when they&#8217;re being observed.  Maybe it&#8217;s just instinct, but it seems to establish that squirrels do have a theory of mind after all.  Well how about that!  They are cuties.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blame you for not ranking animals by IQ!  IQ is a fraught enough measurement tool even for us humans, and we invented it for ourselves!</p>
<p>As for Dakota&#8217;s specific approach, I find it very interesting.  &#8220;Did she choose a strategy and plan its execution? Or was she just improvising, driven by instinct to do what &#8216;felt right&#8217;?&#8221; you ask.  I agree that it can be and probably was a combination.  I imagine that she was frustrated at being corraled off from all this social action for a week.  Her frustration may have built and built, and maybe when she kicked Johnny, she was festering from the frustration of being kept out of the arena for so long, on top of whatever resentment or social strategy she may have built up around him for that week.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/animal-minds-the-herd-life/comment-page-1/#comment-40&quot;&gt;Michael Demko&lt;/a&gt;.

Cool example with the chickens! I love it, mostly because people generally consider chickens to be pretty dumb, as animals go. Yet, it&#039;s clear they are not mindless automata at all, but adapt their behavior in intelligent ways and show an impressive degree of understanding. In a book I&#039;m reading now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526346279&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Evolution in Four Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, they bring up an example of an even simpler animal: apparently baby cockroaches imprint on their mother like newborn chicks do, and follow her around for days to learn how to navigate their environment and find the best food sources. Who knew?

I agree that it&#039;s our advanced ability to convey and understand abstract symbols that really sets humans apart from animals. It&#039;s also intriguing that computers are so good at that in some sense, and so very &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; at it in another sense. Gary Marcus has some interesting things to say about that. He&#039;s an AI researcher who argues (correctly, I believe) that deep learning represents only a small part of what the brain does. To make more meaningful advances, he says we&#039;ll have to look at other aspects of our cognitive intelligence and behavior for inspiration.

He&#039;s particularly focused on symbolic reasoning and problem solving, which makes a lot of sense to me. Despite appearances, even big language models that do quite well reading, writing, and answering questions about text don&#039;t really &quot;understand&quot; words like people do. They are very good at recognizing and reproducing patterns in how words are used, but they lack even basic constraints about logic, causality, and common sense. Deep learning systems work on stereotypes rather than reasoning, and it&#039;s startling yet limited success serves to show that human thought is often (but not always) like that, too. You may be right that learning how to do both in one system is where the magic lies! I find that prospect very exciting.

On the other hand, it&#039;s also likely that once we crack that particular nut, we&#039;ll realize there&#039;s some other big hurdle to clear next. Life surely has a lot of clever tricks we don&#039;t even know about yet.  :)]]></description>

Thanks for the comment, Brad! Don&#039;t worry about having something profound to add, any sort of interaction is welcome.

I haven&#039;t seen My Octopus Teacher, but it does sound very interesting.

I think you make a good point about how this concept ties in with religion and ideology. I&#039;ve just started reading a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526353488&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;The Dawn of Everything&lt;/a&gt;, which is very related. That book is pretty focused on people, not animals. It&#039;s all about the story Western culture tells about the &quot;natural order of things,&quot; which is used to establish hierarchy and norms about who gets control over what. As you say, this stance is often used to assert our &quot;God-given&quot; superiority, which is then used to justify control and exploitation of women, people of color, religious minorities, animals, plants, and natural resources.

I&#039;m trying not to get too political with this blog, but in cases like this I think the evidence from biology has very clear and profound things to say that I&#039;m excited to explore. Definitely expect more of that in future posts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your story reminds me of a Scientific American article on chickens that I read a number of years back. Researchers knew that chickens had a variety of calls for specific situations, but it took some very rigorous observation to nail down evidence of how adaptable they were in making use of these calls to achieve subtle results.

One particularly interesting observation was that both males and females would make &quot;warning, predator&quot; calls based on how safely located they themselves were, and avoided making the calls if doing so might put them at unnecessary risk. But they would be more likely to make the calls if there were chicks around that needed to hear the warning, or if there were competing males in exposed positions who might be vulnerable to attack if the predator were to notice the group.

It is of course behind a pay wall, at: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-startling-intelligence-of-the-common-chicken/, but at least one easily locatable copy has been made where the public might find it.

The general trend of animal intelligence research (AI?) seems to follow that of artificial intelligence (also AI?), the more we learn, the harder it is to find things that are easily identifiable as &quot;special&quot; to humans. 

Relative to animals, the ease with which we can adopt novel symbolic references does seem to stand out. I could make up a word, tell you what it means, and you could immediately use it mostly-correctly, for instance. We do this all the time in corporate work settings. But arguably this is an easy thing for computers as well (depending on how you feel about the word &quot;meaning&quot;).

Relative to computers, the ease with which we integrate knowledge and experience from vast, often unrelated domains and synthesize non-terrible plans of action in novel situations seems to set us apart. But this seems to be a pretty standard capability for a lot of animals.

We are able to bridge both of these &quot;forms of intelligence&quot;, and somehow usefully tie them together. That seems to me to be where the magic lies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nate, 

Brad Flanders here. Glad Sandie pointed me to your posts. 

I‚Äôve enjoyed reading your thinking.  I keep wanting to comment, but then wanting to put more thought into my comments (like you‚Äôve done), and then end up just not saying anything.  So here‚Äôs my quick thought on this post. 

I absolutely agree with you about animal consciousness and have previously read &#038; seen documentaries about ravens &#038; octopi. Have you ever seen ‚ÄúMy Octopus Teacher‚Äù? 

My comment is more theoretical than observational, but just based on evolution.  Our biochemistry &#038; DNA language is identical to other animals, a few more of this or that protein made at the appropriate time, but basically the same proteins for the same purposes. The whole anger of religious groups &#038; denial of evolution is because they realized that evolution is incompatible with humans being fundamentally different from animals.  It‚Äôs logically inconsistent to believe we are separate god-like creatures and yet we evolved from animals.
