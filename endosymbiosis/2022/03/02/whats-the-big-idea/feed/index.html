					<description><![CDATA[In an Animal Behavior course I took, the professor said on the first day that there are always two explanations for why an animal engages in a particular behavior - a mechanical explanation, meaning the body&#039;s physical (often neurological) mechanism for what causes the behavior to happen, and an evolutionary one, meaning what adaptive advantage was granted by the behavior.  (I imagine in rare cases the evolutionary explanation could be something else, like a non-adaptive behavior being linked to some other behavior that was adaptive.)  It struck me at some point that in addition to these, in the thinkier animals you also get a third explanation: the story that the animal tells itself about why it&#039;s doing the thing.  Why does the animal think *it&#039;s* doing the behavior?  So for example, if a dog fetches a thrown stick, the mechanical explanation might be that the familiar gesture triggers a positively reinforced impulse associated with a practiced act (though there&#039;s probably a better way to word it).  The evolutionary explanation might be that canines have evolved into team players that enhance their motor skills and learn about the world by playing and that benefit by living and hunting cooperatively.  And the animal&#039;s internal explanation might be, &quot;I want to be useful&quot; or &quot;I want to make [my owner] happy&quot; or &quot;This is what I&#039;m supposed to do.&quot;  I think all three of these types of explanations are useful!  I also think the last one may be the one that most deserves the label of the behavior&#039;s &quot;purpose.&quot;  But talking about the evolutionary purpose of an adaption, including behaviors, is fine.

I do like Dennett!  He&#039;s one of the editors of that *Mind&#039;s I* book from the 80s I told you about, and I&#039;ve also read his *Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking*.  Now I&#039;ll add *From Bacteria to Bach* to my list of possible goal rewards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/whats-the-big-idea/comment-page-1/#comment-25&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Lots of lovely thoughts here. I especially like your point about how things tend to have many purposes from many perspectives! That&#039;s very true. I also like your conception of life as something that can evolve / change its own behavior. I agree that it&#039;s stating roughly the same thing as this convoluted teleology argument, and it works well as an explanation for how life is different from fire.

So why bother with teleology? I think there are two good reasons:
&lt;b&gt;1) Explanatory power.&lt;/b&gt; It&#039;s really useful to talk about the &quot;function&quot; of some organ, the &quot;reason&quot; for some behavior, or the &quot;goals&quot; that motivate some organism. Not only is it intuitive to talk like this, it&#039;s much better for explaining the chaotic open-ended behavior of living things than the laws of physics are. But that sort of language implies teleology, and some scientists vehemently object to that, especially when talking about primitive life. In response, folks like Deacon and Dennett work hard to justify this way of speaking as reasonable and not merely metaphorical. Personally, I find their arguments compelling, but they&#039;re definitely not universally accepted.
&lt;b&gt;2) Unifying design and evolution.&lt;/b&gt; Many people see intentional behavior and thoughtful design as totally different from primal instinct and blind trial and error. They &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; very different, but it&#039;s useful to think of them as two ends of a spectrum rather than two different kinds. Humans aren&#039;t purely rational when we make decisions and design things. We often rely on randomness, free association, lucky accidents, gut feelings, real life trials, and many iterations to get things right. The difference is that evolution &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; has those tools, while humans can &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; use their brains to direct the process and make it more efficient. But any design process has an objective, success criteria, and other forms of teleology. In order to talk about evolution as a kind of design, we need a way of explaining how teleology can emerge spontaneously &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; evolution, then serve to &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt; evolution.

If you&#039;re interested in understanding this perspective better, I highly recommend &lt;i&gt;From Bacteria to Bach&lt;/i&gt; by Daniel Dennett. He&#039;s a delight to read, and he makes some very clear and compelling arguments about this stuff.]]></description>

This Deacon guy sounds pretty shrewd, but I find I&#039;m having a little trouble wrapping my head around the question of what exactly makes a behavior purposeful, if it&#039;s not the definition I said.  What makes propagation a &#039;purpose&#039; of life and not just a thing that life does?  A thing can have a purpose it was designed for, or it can have a purpose in mind, meaning something it&#039;s trying to do.  But if we look at complex, intention-like but not actually intentional behavior and say it has a purpose, it seems to me that purpose may depend on our point of view (since we&#039;re not looking at the point of view of the thing itself or its designer by default, which would anchor the concept).  Thinking of an example is challenging, though!

A lamp sitting in a house on a table may, to an interior designer, have the purpose of adding a touch of class and visual interest to a room.  To a Feng Shui expert, it may have the purpose of disrupting eastward energy.  To the owner of the study, it may have the purpose of shedding light so one can read.  So its purpose depends on our point of view.  The lamp may also be reinforced with a coating over the glass to make it unbreakable, and this could be seen as having the purpose of preserving the lamp&#039;s existence.  This doesn&#039;t make the lamp alive, of course, though.

If the important thing here is the feedback loop--that an action taken by a thing causes that thing to exist more because in the cases where it wasn&#039;t there, it no longer existed more, isn&#039;t that selection pressure?  Could we do away with the trickiness of the word &#039;purpose&#039;, then, and perhaps its cousin &#039;teleology&#039;, and just say that life is that which -can- evolve due to selection pressure?  It seems to me like that&#039;s what the definition you&#039;re considering comes down to.]]></description>

I think your argument of using a representation to predict the future is a good summary of what &lt;i&gt;brains&lt;/i&gt; do. It allows living things to anticipate and avoid dead ends, which is something that Thorin&#039;s top-level comment on the blog post gets at: plants &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; anticipate in this way, and thus their intelligence feels different from our own.

The interesting thing about evolution, in contrast, is that evaluating what is good or bad for the organism is done &lt;i&gt;retrospectively&lt;/i&gt;. Life doesn&#039;t anticipate and select fruitful paths of evolution. Instead, it tries &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the paths, and the fruitful ones end up out-competing the others in the long run, becoming dominant and generating further variations on that theme. It still discovers the fruitful paths and makes &quot;design decisions&quot; with good reasons, but the reasons are implicit. The process of evolution doesn&#039;t care why something works, only that it works. Still, if the adaptation works reliably, there must be some reason for that, which an evolutionary biologist might try to suss out.

So, say some bacterium evolves a modified flagellum that allows it to swim faster, survive longer, and have more offspring. That happened by chance, not by choice. There was no representation or anticipation. However, the adaptation had a &quot;purpose&quot;: making the bacterium go faster. This new functionality &lt;i&gt;caused&lt;/i&gt; the bacterium to have more offspring. Future bacteria will have this same adaptation &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; it made their ancestor faster and more successful than the others. It&#039;s this causal feedback loop that makes it correct to use the term &quot;purpose,&quot; or so Deacon (and Dennett) would argue.

Going back to the fire example, a fire may create a draft that pushes it towards more fuel. Why does that happen? The laws of physics. Fire itself has no control. Under different circumstances, the fire might make a draft that pushes it &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; from the fuel source, causing it to die out more quickly. Physics and fire don&#039;t prefer either one of these outcomes. Neither will change its behavior &quot;for the purpose&quot; of propagating fire. Fire is not teleological in the way that life is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/whats-the-big-idea/comment-page-1/#comment-22&quot;&gt;Nate Gaylinn (he/him)&lt;/a&gt;.

&quot;For the purpose of&quot; is still something I am trying to unpack from that book. It seems to relate to the idea of &quot;representation&quot; - that some systemic state is induced by the process, which allows the process to predict a fruitful mechanism for growth, and this prediction itself is able to feed back into the process&#039;s behaviour, intensifying its ability to propagate.

Ooh, interesting suggestion. I recently re-read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379971&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Incomplete Nature&lt;/a&gt;, which touches on this. I think Deacon would say that the key difference here is that life changes its own shape and behavior &lt;i&gt;for the purpose of&lt;/i&gt; propagating itself. Fire changes its shape and behavior only because of how &quot;outside forces&quot; push it around. Of course, fire heats the air and generates drafts that can have the effect of driving it to propagate, but ultimately that feedback loop is incidental. It happens because it happens, not &quot;for&quot; some purpose. Regardless of whether those effects were beneficial or not, the fire eventually burns through its fuel, destroying itself without learning or changing in any way. By contrast, life does adaptive things &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; they are known to correlate with successful propagation. It&#039;s a kind of knowledge, found, refined, and passed on across generations. The behavior has a &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt;, even if that reason is not known to the organism.

I think he&#039;d also agree that the term &quot;level-shifting&quot; to a more &quot;clever&quot; sort of behavior is an accurate way to describe this transition. Though, he might say it like this: &lt;i&gt;&quot;teleodynamic processes supervene morphodynamic processes by constraining the relationship of their orthograde tendencies in order to do work in the semantic domain.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

Fair enough. I don&#039;t disagree. Computation can be a &lt;i&gt;model&lt;/i&gt; for all this, but reality is more than any model. Simply saying &quot;life is computation&quot; is oversimplifying things, and I need to find more nuanced ways of talking about that relationship without getting overly philosophical. It&#039;s helpful to have that pointed out, so, thanks.

In any case, the point I really want to make is I hope to find computational models of processes in very different domains of life that are compatible and comparable with each other. I should focus more on that less controversial statement  ;)]]></description>

Computation, for me, is a matter of symbolic manipulation. There are ways in which the operation of life fits into that paradigm, but many things don&#039;t seem to fit the mold for me.]]></description>
