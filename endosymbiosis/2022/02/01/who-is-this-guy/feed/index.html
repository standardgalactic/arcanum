I mean, there is a lot of overlap. We even had quests, grinding, metric minimaxing, leveling up...

Also, we wrote a lot of code. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So my two earlier comments were submission failures!  We cannot be related because everytime I use any digital device, something terrible happens.  Each comment shrinks. Nevertheless, I want to tell you how proud I am of you and the wonderful path you have chosen. Just follow your heart and I am sure you will succeed. Please continue to keep me informed about your work. Love to Christina, and may you both be well and happy.]]></description>

Yeah, I&#039;ve got a Goodreads account where I&#039;m tracking the best books I&#039;ve read related to this work. I&#039;m still catching up on my backlog of reviews to write, and I&#039;ve got a huge reading list ahead of me, but you can check it out here: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144426838-nate-gaylinn

And, yes! That&#039;s me in the photo.  :)]]></description>
