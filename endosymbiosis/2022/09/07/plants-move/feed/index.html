					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/09/07/plants-move/comment-page-1/#comment-79&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;re right that a single organism can have many offspring, which amounts to a stronger positive signal for the population as a whole. I was thinking about something a little different: the &quot;software&quot; that receives the signal is a single individual organism. If you were born, then your parent(s) must have been doing something right, and that&#039;s the only information you get until you evolve the ability to learn from your environment / parents after birth (higher intelligence). Both of these perspectives are correct and important. An organism can&#039;t directly observe and react to population-wide effects (that requires communication of a sort), but a large population does amplify the noisy fitness signal by sampling it many times.

I should probably do a whole blog post about how life influences the trajectory of its own evolution, &#039;cuz that&#039;s a very big and subtle idea. Here&#039;s a simple example, though: the Universe is the ultimate judge of an organism&#039;s fitness, and evolution works by testing lots of ideas and having most of them shot down (literally killed) by the Universe. However, mate selection gives an organism the chance to use its full faculties to estimate how fit a potential mate is and how fit their children might be. If those estimates are accurate, then the organism gets to bias the next generation towards greater fitness. There will be fewer &quot;wasted trials&quot; where an obviously less fit individual predictably fails to reproduce. The search process overall will be more efficient, because it will anticipate and avoid dead ends, rather than wasting time and energy actually testing them in the Universe. The more intelligent life gets, the better its estimates are, and the more efficient the search becomes.

I agree, the main advantage of being sessile is saving energy. If it also makes evolution more efficient, great, but that should have a way more subtle impact on an individual&#039;s fitness which would be very hard to demonstrate. Yet, I think this idea that &quot;constraints are valuable&quot; helps explain why sessile organisms can be so well adapted and responsive to their environments despite being so simple. When the environment is predictable, evolution can fine tune behavior very well, so that&#039;s all you need. In a less predictable environment, you need to make more complex, open-ended judgments in real time, which requires more complex and expensive forms of intelligence (like brains). Part of why being sessile saves energy is because it allows you to get away with cheaping out and using evolution as your primary means of adapting to change.

I don&#039;t actually know of anyone else talking about evolution in this way or making these sorts of predictions! That&#039;s part of why I want to get into the field. Of course, I hope I&#039;m not alone, and I&#039;m actively looking for others who are researching these questions. I just don&#039;t know how to find them yet.  :-P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve mentioned before this idea of evolution having the minimal possible feedback to work with it working its process: reproduction or dead.  But at least there are different levels of reproduction for each organism, right?  So a particular organism could have a hundred viable offspring, or three, or one, or none.  That&#039;s a much better spread of feedback than just a binary signal, right?

&quot;The exciting idea thatâ€™s at the core of my research is that life recruits the full intelligence of each organism (through processes like mutation management and sexual selection) to get more of a signal to learn from, and make the iterative design process more efficient and intelligent.&quot;  I&#039;d like to hear more about that, since I don&#039;t immediately see what you mean.

&quot;Most moving organism canâ€™t choose not to move. Once youâ€™ve committed to having a high-powered metabolism, you need to stay very active just to fulfill its needs.&quot;  That&#039;s what I was trying to say - the main advantage of being sessile is that you save energy, not that it puts useful constraints on your species&#039; evolution.  I would think it would be very hard to establish that useful constraints could, by themselves, wind up benefiting a species or some larger biological group, and it might be hard to establish it had happened even if they did.

Yes, I believe the process of evolution is itself intelligent. Though, this is where I&#039;d like to have a better definition for the word &quot;intelligent.&quot; Basically, evolution is a kind of design process. It generates many possible ideas, tests them, and iteratively improves on the best ones. This seems intelligent to me, and it certainly produces intelligence. It&#039;s relatively dumb, though, because it gets the minimal amount of feedback possible: Either &quot;good enough&quot; (reproduction) or no signal (dead). There&#039;s very little anyone can do with that. The exciting idea that&#039;s at the core of my research is that life recruits the full intelligence of each organism (through processes like mutation management and sexual selection) to get more of a signal to learn from, and make the iterative design process more efficient and intelligent. So, it&#039;s not just that evolution is intelligent, but also that organisms can make observations and decisions that influence evolution and therefor accumulate over generations.

I&#039;m no expert in plant communication, but it is fascinating. I&#039;ll try to learn a bit more about it before I write a blog post. Certainly, mycelial networks and their interactions with trees would be a good topic to explore within that theme!

Most moving organism &lt;i&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; choose not to move. Once you&#039;ve committed to having a high-powered metabolism, you need to stay very active just to fulfill its needs. On the other hand, some species are bordeline. They haven&#039;t over-committed to either strategy, and can thus switch on demand. Usually, they adopt a sedentary lifestyle when the environment is safe and abundant, and a mobile lifestyle when it&#039;s not. Some species permanently switch strategies, but usually that only happens with the ones who are already in that borderline territory .]]></description>

The giant fungal network I&#039;ve seen cited as possibly the world&#039;s largest organism is in Oregon, which Pando is in Utah.  It seems the Armillaria ostoyae network is the largest known organism in land area covered, but Pando is probably more massive.

I believe some algae are classified as plants, and I wanted to make the point that single-celled plants exist. You are correct, though, that algaeÂ generally are not classified as plants.

If you heard the largest organism was a fungal colony, that may still have been Pando they were talking about. I believe the aspens are matched by a fungal mat of about the same size, and that they have a deeply symbiotic relationship. Pando&#039;s claim to &quot;biggest organism&quot; is a little ambiguous, but less so if you consider the trees and the fungus together, as some people do since they&#039;re so interdependent. Does Pando ever reproduce sexually? Guess it depends on how often it encounters other aspens.

When it comes to problem solving and intelligence, what&#039;s the difference when it happens in an individual, in a community, or in a lineage overy millions of years? Why do you think of these things differently? I think one of the obstacles to understanding intelligence is we often try to localize it to a single individual in the moment, but why can&#039;t it be spread out across many individuals and across broad stretches of time?

Think of it this way. A single brain is made of about 100 billion cells, and it often takes hundreds of milliseconds for cascades of firing neurons to cohere into a thought. Imagine those brain cells were separated and spread out across an area the size of a forest. Imagine the messages passed between neurons moved very slowly, taking hours or days or years to propagate. The individual brain cells might even die and replace themselves many times waiting for a signal to arrive. That would be much slower and more spread out than what we&#039;re used to, but why couldn&#039;t the patterns of mental activity be the same? Not saying Pando is a giant brain, just pointing out that, computationally speaking, size and speed and distribution don&#039;t matterâ€”it&#039;s all about the patterns of activity.

I&#039;d love to do a post about plant communication. What interests you about that? Any questions on your mind, or favorite examples you&#039;d like to share?

Yes, being rooted is primarily about getting nutrients. I just wanted to make a little perspective shift. I think most people assume a sessile lifestyle means not-intelligent, but to me it seems like it must provide a significant evolutionary advantage. It&#039;s a kind of useful constraint that maximizes the adaptive power of evolution and reduces the need for real-time computation, saving energy and reducing complexity for the organism.]]></description>

<p>Think of it this way. A single brain is made of about 100 billion cells, and it often takes hundreds of milliseconds for cascades of firing neurons to cohere into a thought. Imagine those brain cells were separated and spread out across an area the size of a forest. Imagine the messages passed between neurons moved very slowly, taking hours or days or years to propagate. The individual brain cells might even die and replace themselves many times waiting for a signal to arrive. That would be much slower and more spread out than what we&#8217;re used to, but why couldn&#8217;t the patterns of mental activity be the same? Not saying Pando is a giant brain, just pointing out that, computationally speaking, size and speed and distribution don&#8217;t matterâ€”it&#8217;s all about the patterns of activity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to do a post about plant communication. What interests you about that? Any questions on your mind, or favorite examples you&#8217;d like to share?</p>
<p>Yes, being rooted is primarily about getting nutrients. I just wanted to make a little perspective shift. I think most people assume a sessile lifestyle means not-intelligent, but to me it seems like it must provide a significant evolutionary advantage. It&#8217;s a kind of useful constraint that maximizes the adaptive power of evolution and reduces the need for real-time computation, saving energy and reducing complexity for the organism.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I will try keeping a running commentary on this blog post!  So you can see my thoughts as I have them.  I&#039;m looking forward to this one because I&#039;m intrigued when people talk about plant intelligence, but I haven&#039;t researched it myself.

A small point: algae are not technically classed as plants, but as plant-like micro-organisms, probably protists.  I think I&#039;ve seen red algae classed in their own kingdom.

The biomass chart is interesting!  I&#039;m surprised by how much marine arthropods outweigh the terrestrial kind.  I guess it&#039;s reasonable!  Also, I guess I would have expected fish to outweigh land vertibrates, but not by that much.  I thought the annelids were even more massive.  I&#039;m surprised our livestock is more massive than ourselves.

I assumed biomass was just the mass of living things.  This idea that it&#039;s just the carbon in living things is new to me.  A web search suggests that total mass is the normal meaning of the word.

The Pando video was neat!  I&#039;ve heard the largest organism is actually a giant fungal mat network.  Looks like it&#039;s also in the Western U.S., interestingly, though I can&#039;t find how massive it is.  I see that Pando is male and reproduced asexually to get so large.  I wonder if it (he?) ever reproduces sexually.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to say that plant compounds being useful in medicine counts as plant intelligence.  Even if the compounds are used the same way in the plant as they are in our medicine, that&#039;s just an example of plant evolution gradually solving problems, not individual plants or even plant communities doing so.  And heck, plenty of animal compounds are probably useful to plants, too--fertilizer comes to mind.

Yay I got through the first paragraph!

All these things that plants do are familiar, in that I&#039;ve heard or read about them.  There&#039;s also plant communication, which I&#039;m especially curious about.  But do most plants do most of these things, or is this just a list of things that some plant somewhere has been documented as doing?  If most plants don&#039;t do most of these things, maybe it&#039;s fair to say they aren&#039;t very active.

I think I agree that faster movement isn&#039;t inherently more intelligent.

The thoughts on how plants do the hard work of energy-capturing (not just from air and soil, but from the sun!) that we animals luxuriate by living on reminds me of my longest poem, &quot;Moochers.&quot;  I thought I&#039;d shared it with you, but perhaps not!

I would think the main reason for an organism to root itself to the ground is to pull nutrients from the ground.

I remember learning in biology class how plants angle toward the sun by growing more cells on the side opposite.  I&#039;m curious how they react internally to being touched.  I cn respect the elegance of plant design and what we may call intelligence, like a set of programmed responses that you set up and see what happens over a long board game.

Hee turgor.  Shifting water between cells does indeed seem practical and it&#039;s good to know about it.

It is nifty how plant seeds get spread hither and yon.  I agree that helicoptering and tricking animals into moving you &quot;counts&quot; as migrating, and as a mechanism for movement.  After all, when we walk, not all the energy involved comes from our own bodies... we can benefit from tailwinds, be carried by our parents, and get into motorized vehicles.  Hello sticky burr, I say.  You are a cutie.

&quot;For one thing, life doesnâ€™t need a brain to navigate obstacles, seek out resources, climb, glide, follow a daily routine, catch prey, or even launch projectiles.&quot;  Well put!  This gives me a renewed appreciation of the beauty of life, and I&#039;m coming around on the idea of calling these adaptive behaviors &quot;intelligence.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/09/07/plants-move/comment-page-1/#comment-72&quot;&gt;Diego&lt;/a&gt;.

Evolution is a powerful way to design complex systems that serve some purpose. It&#039;s painfully slow, but it accelerates over time as innovations are preserved and layers of sophistication accumulate. It&#039;s amazing how many intelligent behaviors are shared by all multicellular life. Humans (and all mammals, really) stand out because we have some of the most sophisticated real-time intelligence in the world. We have minds that model and refine the intelligent behaviors of our bodies as best they can, given their very limited awareness. They imagine past and future and produce a conscious perception of time. What they do is incredibly cool and powerful, but also wholly dependent on the foundation of our bodies, which set the limits of our abilities and handle all the &quot;real work&quot; of surviving in the world.

I think it&#039;s awesome that Deep Learning research allows us to recreate some of the power of a mind. Yet, I see that technology as simulating a small patch of a single, disembodied brain. What it models and how it interacts with the world are defined by a programmer, and limited by that programmer&#039;s creativity. All it can do is extract meaning and reproduce patterns created by some other intelligent system. For instance, the mind-blowing image generation algorithms in the news these days only work because they draw on images created and curated by people. In other words, the power of Deep Learning is dependent on human minds, which are dependent on human bodies, which are a product of evolution.

Personally, I&#039;m profoundly moved by the idea that my conscious intelligence is just one small part of an enormously complex system, and a natural design program spanning billions of years. I think it&#039;s really important to understand our minds in context.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is insightful, Nate. IMO, that intelligence is the same intelligence of mother nature or however you want to call it. That intelligence runs our bodies and is the same on every living creature, like the intelligence that runs your heart, breathing, circulatory system, etc. And it&#039;s not directly related to intellectual intelligence from the mind. Yet, it&#039;s the one we can access anytime we want, from the state of presence and stillness, where there&#039;s no time dimension. What are your thoughts?]]></description>
