I... don&#039;t want to claim any expertise here... my impressions on how this works come mainly from reading magazine articles aimed at the general public. It&#039;s worth thinking about how circulatory systems like blood and lymph work. Blood vessels have walls that are made up of cells, and blood itself carries cells (blood cells!). So blood vessels are structures larger than individual cells, and isn&#039;t like every cell in the body has a dedicated vessel. The &quot;last mile&quot; of nutrient delivery to cells basically has to be diffusion, as I understand things.]]></description>

Interesting. TBH, that&#039;s an aspect of cell biology I&#039;m not familiar with. Where did you learn about that?

I&#039;m not surprised, though; life &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; has hard boundaries.]]></description>

&quot;Nanobots&quot; suggest an extreme isolation between components, each with very clear boundaries. Cells do have boundaries, but don&#039;t just exchange information and apply physical forces on one another across those boundaries. They also exchange a lot of fluid, with very complex organic molecules suspended in that fluid. The &quot;interface&quot; between cells is very complex, and difficult even to formally describe, which is not the intuition that comes to me from the nanobots analogy.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure I follow. Could you explain the lubricant / fluid metaphor a bit better? Sounds very messy.

When you talk about belief vs. thought, you mean how your body / mind intuitively feels vs. what science tells you about how it really works? I think it&#039;s fair to say these may never align, and that&#039;s okay.

That said, I find it&#039;s really invaluable to embrace the limitations of what my mind can do. I accept that my perception is biased to what I want and expect to see, that my memory is unreliable, that my beliefs and intuitions aren&#039;t necessarily grounded in facts and reason, that my emotions can warp all of those things in ways I may not even be aware of. My mind is very trustworthy most of the time, but I&#039;ve learned to notice situations when it might not be and take precautions. The hard part is maintaining skepticism and humility when my natural reaction is to double down and get defensive. So, I still perceive my mind and body in the ways that come naturally (as opposed to the scientific view), I just remember that this image is not &quot;true&quot; so much as it is &quot;useful,&quot; and that I should always take it with a grain of salt.]]></description>

There are lots of big organisms that don&#039;t have brains, too. Think about trees, which can be enormous in themselves, but can also form super-organisms with other individual trees and a vast network of underground mycelium.

Why do I like the word &quot;simulation&quot; here? Well, think about the data available to your brain just for vision. Each eye can see only a tiny spot in high definition, and everything around it is just a blur. To take in a whole scene, your eyes must dart around wildly to scan all the important details, but you don&#039;t notice this happening. Instead, you perceive a fully-integrated three dimensional scene with a uniformly high level of detail. I think the right way to think about this is that your brain is constantly maintaining a simulation of the world around you that is consistent with the sensory data you take in. So, yeah, for the most part, what you see is &quot;really there.&quot; Your brain is trying to represent reality faithfully. But you only see the image after some very heavy processing, and most of the image is actually a mix of historical data (what it looked like a moment ago), inference (like with depth perception), and expectations (filling in detail from your knowledge of the world), not an accurate representation of the light currently hitting your retinas.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;nanobots&quot; still sounds very engineered to me, not messy enough. Maybe let&#039;s add some lubricant that all those bots float in, that washes in and out of all the bots, collecting waste and supplying raw materials for the bot&#039;s maintenance. The mecha occasionally needs to douse itself with more lubricant (and actually, there are many different things floating in that fluid, all of which come from different sources, which need to be combined with one another in very precise proportions). Furthermore, there are hundreds of different designs of nanobot that come pre-built and pre-submerged in some of the fluids. And the &quot;mind&quot; we&#039;re talking about here is really just a version of Twitter - the individual signals sent around don&#039;t contain a lot of &#039;bytes&#039;, and the bots like to send those signals on a whim with no lengthy consideration of consequence.

I&#039;m not sure that this picture fundamentally changes how I perceive my mind though. One really big gap is between what I &quot;think&quot; is true about my mind (roughly, the words I tend to use to describe it), and what I &quot;believe&quot; is true about my mind (roughly, the visualizations and perceptions that frame my day-to-day awareness of it). I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to say that I am &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with what I think is true, but I would say that I have never been able to align the belief parts of the story with the thought parts of the story. As someone with a very technical background, I&#039;m in the habit of acting on thoughts that have no strong associated beliefs (of the sort I am talking about here), but I don&#039;t know to what extent that is the norm among people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/06/01/beyond-blueprints/comment-page-1/#comment-49&quot;&gt;Nate Gaylinn (he/him)&lt;/a&gt;.

If you&#039;ve got a brain, you need it!  I mean, in general, if you&#039;ve gone to the trouble of evolving pretty much anything, you probably kind of need it, and big brains take energy, which means if you&#039;ve got a big brain, it&#039;s probably necessary for your survival.  I guess most species don&#039;t have brains because most species are tiny thingyboppers.  It&#039;s weird to use that fact in generalizations about organisms or even animals.  By this kind of universal standard, a fruit fly is a gigantic creature indeed!

I think this question of whether DNA spread throughout the body constitutes an implicit plan for the body is interesting philosophically.  It would mean talking about what &#039;implicit&#039; means, among other things, but probably belongs in your book at some point, if not on this blog.

I&#039;m reading _Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo_ by Sean B. Carroll.  Which--wow--is already 16 years old!  I thought it was more cutting edge than that.  It seems beloved of some people and I guess I do recommend it, though I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone else has managed to make the subject even juicier.  The process a developing animal body uses to build itself seems like a pretty good candidate for the concept of &quot;intelligence,&quot; if we&#039;re using the words for plants and societies and stuff.  So it may make sense for you to read it before school... but then, there&#039;s probably a case for way too many books and subjects being related to your field of study.

I was internally nodding along to your statements about not everything in a cell being in DNA, but when you finished off your paragraph with &quot;If we broadcast the human genome out into space, aliens could never make a human being from that data,&quot; it struck me in a new way.  Yeah, I guess!  I&#039;d always unthinkingly assumed such a thing *was* possible.  But even if they knew what each polypeptide stood for and how to make a DNA molecule... how are you going to get that thing churning without the painstakingly evolved cellular mechanisms used to read it?  I didn&#039;t grasp until you said this how -much- of the body&#039;s workings is independent from the genome.  I guess I was just thinking of it as similar to how a computer program can produce unpredicted behavior and thinking, yes, you get weird extra stuff not directly coded for in the DNA, but... not having the machinery to run the program at ALL is on a different level of incompleteness.

These statements about the mind representing itself and the environment in a simulation that we spend our whole existences in... that&#039;s also quite philosophical!  It makes me feel uncomfortable.  I don&#039;t think it makes sense to say that the only existence we know is a simulation... since it kind of defines what&#039;s real, depending on how you look at things.  I don&#039;t really want to get into epistemology and the whole noumenon/phenomenon thing... but I&#039;m inclined to say that what we perceive of the world isn&#039;t a simulation or reflection of reality, but rather a *part* of reality.  I presume you have an argument why &#039;simulation&#039; is the right term, though.

Is imagination what you&#039;re talking about here?  The faculty of imagination produces simulations, yes, but it&#039;s just one function of a mind.  If we imagine a little shrew or something getting rushed by a predator and reflexively bending its articulated joints and leaping away... I don&#039;t think imagination necessarily plays a role there; we&#039;re talking about something more basic.  The mind processes perceptual signals and synthesizes them somehow into the notion of &quot;scary thing&quot; and triggers a flight reflex.  So, how is this a simulation?]]></description>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a brain, you need it!  I mean, in general, if you&#8217;ve gone to the trouble of evolving pretty much anything, you probably kind of need it, and big brains take energy, which means if you&#8217;ve got a big brain, it&#8217;s probably necessary for your survival.  I guess most species don&#8217;t have brains because most species are tiny thingyboppers.  It&#8217;s weird to use that fact in generalizations about organisms or even animals.  By this kind of universal standard, a fruit fly is a gigantic creature indeed!</p>
<p>I think this question of whether DNA spread throughout the body constitutes an implicit plan for the body is interesting philosophically.  It would mean talking about what &#8216;implicit&#8217; means, among other things, but probably belongs in your book at some point, if not on this blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading _Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo_ by Sean B. Carroll.  Which&#8211;wow&#8211;is already 16 years old!  I thought it was more cutting edge than that.  It seems beloved of some people and I guess I do recommend it, though I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if someone else has managed to make the subject even juicier.  The process a developing animal body uses to build itself seems like a pretty good candidate for the concept of &#8220;intelligence,&#8221; if we&#8217;re using the words for plants and societies and stuff.  So it may make sense for you to read it before school&#8230; but then, there&#8217;s probably a case for way too many books and subjects being related to your field of study.</p>
<p>I was internally nodding along to your statements about not everything in a cell being in DNA, but when you finished off your paragraph with &#8220;If we broadcast the human genome out into space, aliens could never make a human being from that data,&#8221; it struck me in a new way.  Yeah, I guess!  I&#8217;d always unthinkingly assumed such a thing *was* possible.  But even if they knew what each polypeptide stood for and how to make a DNA molecule&#8230; how are you going to get that thing churning without the painstakingly evolved cellular mechanisms used to read it?  I didn&#8217;t grasp until you said this how -much- of the body&#8217;s workings is independent from the genome.  I guess I was just thinking of it as similar to how a computer program can produce unpredicted behavior and thinking, yes, you get weird extra stuff not directly coded for in the DNA, but&#8230; not having the machinery to run the program at ALL is on a different level of incompleteness.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/06/01/beyond-blueprints/comment-page-1/#comment-48&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems like you&#039;ve considered theory of mind enough already that you immediately saw the &quot;pilot in the cockpit&quot; as a problematic straw person, which is what it was intended to be. You&#039;re right that it doesn&#039;t make sense that there&#039;s a little you inside of you, but that is the point I was trying to make.  :)

What other species depend on big brains for survival? Perhaps I phrased this poorly. I meant to emphasize that relatively few species depend on having a brain &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;, let alone a big fancy one. In general, any organism that has a brain depends on it, though there are interesting examples of animals carrying on even after their brains are injured or destroyed.

As for the blueprint analogy, the main points I wanted to make were how much autonomy each cell has, and how the design and operation of the body only emerges from the coordinated activity of all those cells. There is no top-down master plan for the body, though you might claim that such a plan exists &lt;i&gt;implicitly&lt;/i&gt;, distributed across the recipe books in all those cells.

I look forward to learning more about developmental biology! It&#039;s a fascinating subject. Would you recommend the book you&#039;re reading? I&#039;m not sure whether to read something now or wait until grad school and take a class.

It would be tricky to construct a cell from scratch, but there&#039;s a more subtle point I&#039;m trying to make. DNA does not make cells. Cells make cells, and use DNA in the process. The weird consequence of this is that not everything that the cell is or does is necessarily represented in the DNA &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. Much of a cell&#039;s behavior is actually determined by the machinery that interprets DNA, and that machinery replicates &lt;i&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt; along with the DNA in mitosis. DNA is not all you need for life. It&#039;s just an inert, lifeless molecule until it gets injected into a working cell. If we broadcast the human genome out into space, aliens could never make a human being from that data.

I&#039;ll definitely say more about the mind in future posts. In the meantime, let me try to make myself more clear. Each organism is a machine that observes the world and reacts to it, cell by cell. This works great for certain kinds of bodies that are small or don&#039;t have to move themselves in very complicated ways (microbes, fungi, plants). However, if you want a big body with articulated joints that moves quickly, then you need some sort of coordinated planning, or your cells will just trip all over themselves. That&#039;s what the mind does. It represents the self and the environment in an integrated simulation. Your consciousness is a part of that simulation, a bit like in &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;. You aren&#039;t conscious of &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; that happens in your body, but your mind has a scope of awareness that encompasses the whole body. None of the cells can do that, which is why the body needs this simulation to make global plans.]]></description>
