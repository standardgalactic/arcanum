&lt;p&gt;I take your point about bacteria learning collectively!  So, we can say that some bacteria collectively had the intelligence to use bound nitrogen... or perhaps, it makes more sense to ascribe the intelligence needed to come up with the nitrogen fixation process to the evolutionary process that created that process.  That seems more logical to me, though I&#039;m not used to evolution itself being ascribed intelligence.  Individual intelligence can stem from learning or from instinct, but at least instinct involves making choices.  Collective intelligence reminds me of an beehive or a bunch of chimpanzees learning from each other.  Evolutionary intelligence strikes me as a valid concept, but quite different from these things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the shady idea of giving intelligence away for free... I was just replying to your original statement, &quot;We tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case.&quot;  Maybe it&#039;s only not the case when you take its price into account.  Sure, if intelligence means having to deal with the burdens of a big brain, it&#039;s definitely far from always better.  In a vacuum, though?  Anyway, sorry to make you muse about trees with muscles and eyes and brains. :&#062;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difference between controlling something and having power over it is indeed a big one.  How much you control something seems to depend on how many possible outcomes you can choose to bring about in it.  I&#039;d say we have some control over nature, but it&#039;s highly limited and tenuous, and risky to employ.  Sometimes it seems to be worth it, though; not every attempt to modify an ecosystem ends in failure.  We have much more control over our own societies, and in turn more control over our families, and in turn more control over out own bodies.  But even that level of control still represents just a tiny percentage of all the ways the thing could be.  (Well, it depends how you look at it, of course.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/what-intelligence-is-not/comment-page-1/#comment-341&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

I think I ought to write more about the intelligence of cells and microbes specifically, because it really is quite impressive. I think what makes this sort of intelligence hard to recognize is that it doesn’t fit our usual framing. Like, nitrogen fixing bacteria doesn’t &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; to fix nitrogen, they don’t “know” how to do it, and they’re not “figuring out” anything new when they do, it’s just some rote behavior. And yet, from an evolutionary perspective, this microbe solved a central problem to living here on Earth.

Nitrogen is an extremely valuable nutrient, and there’s plenty of it, just in a form that’s useless without some clever chemistry. Only a handful of species have figured out the trick to extract nitrogen from the air, and they are near the root of basically &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; food chain on the planet. We all depend on that work. And it is creative work, too. These microbes had to &lt;i&gt;discover&lt;/i&gt; nitrogen fixing, realize its value, and optimize it for efficient production. They had to invent tools for manipulating, managing, and integrating nitrogen into their own biological processes. To find their niche, they had to co-evolve with plants, adapting to their needs, striking a metabolic compromise, negotiating “treaties” for trading rare nutrients and bargaining for access to protected spaces. I’m being rather anthropomorphic here, but that’s just because we don’t really have a good vocabulary for discussing this kind of adaptation and innovation. I agree with you that we could use more and better words! But it’s a mistake to think this stuff “just happens” or isn’t as “intelligent” as what humans do. The main difference is microbes learn, “think,” and behave &lt;i&gt;collectively&lt;/i&gt;, on different time scales, and using different mechanisms.

If a species could get more intelligent without having to pay for it, wouldn’t that be better? I don’t know. It’s kind of a strange question, because you &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; have to pay. We evolve intelligence to get around the constraints of the world, so if we had &lt;i&gt;fewer&lt;/i&gt; metabolic constraints, there would be less need for intelligence, not more. I do see your point, though. My first thought is to look to trees. Would they be better off if they had greater personal intelligence? I mean, maybe if they could act in the moment to shoo a predator, or get better access to the sun, they would be better off. But they do that already, just slowly! To go faster, they’d need muscles and eyes and brains or something like that, but would that be worth it? I guess if we’re giving it all away for free, then why not, but the tree’s current level of intelligence seems very effective for its life strategy.

You make good points about the &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; of a big brain, but it’s also worth considering its value. We take it for granted that brains are good, but what do they really do? They help us build and maintain real-time internal models of the external world. Seemingly, the main purpose of that is to let us run thought experiments instead of acting in real life, which is safer and uses fewer resources. But you also need to take the time and effort to develop that mental model. You need to stop and consider your actions before you take them. If your mental model doesn’t align with the real world, that can be a big problem. There are plenty of lifestyles where this isn’t of much benefit, or could even be counterproductive. And if you’re willing to be small or slow, you can do all those things in different ways, without neurons.

Yeah, that’s a very interesting question! What is the cognitive value of language outside of cultural transmission? I don’t think we have any idea. Part of the answer probably lies in the evolutionary precursors or prerequisites for the language faculty, but we don’t understand that very well either.

Yes, I would argue that we need nature to keep innovating, exploring, and producing not just the things we need, but robust ecosystems &lt;i&gt;surrounding&lt;/i&gt; the things we need, and whatever nature needs for its own wellbeing.

As for “control” and “rights” I think they are just human fictions. We do not have “control” over nature, much as we like to pretend we do. We have &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt; over nature. We can force it to do some things with violence, but not all things, and it may push back in various ways, including by dying away instead of complying. Do we have the “right” to do that? We have the power to. Nobody’s gonna stop us, except ourselves. As you say, it’s a matter of what we think is moral, and how well we hold ourselves to those moral standards. However, I think we have done (and still do!) a lot to minimize and avoid this moral quandary, looking away from it so we can continue to exploit nature without guilt or compromise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/what-intelligence-is-not/comment-page-1/#comment-340&quot;&gt;Nate Gaylinn (he/him)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&#039;Did intelligence evolve steadily?&#039; In a word, no. This was actually one of the biggest early criticisms against Darwin’s theory. The reality in the fossil record seems to be “punctuated equilibrium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, punctuated equilibrium I&#039;ve heard of. I recall it was an idea supported by Stephen Jay Gould. And it makes sense, as human history also has punctuated equilibrium or something close to it, and it&#039;s fun to think of those periods of brief upheaval. Still, the question remains… did (maximum) intelligence evolve evenly in time with these punctuated periods of rapid evolution? Was it AS steady as the rest of evolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think when intelligence is lost, it’s more often from suddenly not having enough calories and going extinct, rather than scaling back brains to save calories, but I’m no expert on that.&quot; Yes, my intuition agrees! That&#039;s almost macabre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting to learn about IQ being even more limited in its ability to put things in perspective than I realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your remarks about nitrogen-fixing bacteria incited me to impulsively draft a smol observer poem. Yet it still puzzles me that you consider this biological capability a form of intelligence. Would you call it intelligence whenever any process in any creature&#039;s body changes some chemical to some other chemical? When the body works the way it&#039;s evolved to work, e.g. when platelets seal up a cut? I guess the immune system targeting invaders is a type of intelligence, and I can see how that makes sense. But just the fact that a creature can eat what it eats… if that&#039;s intelligence, it seems to me we really need a really to distinguish traditional mental intelligence from the other kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I said &quot;I think more intelligence is better,&quot; I didn&#039;t mean for a species… I meant for myself, really, or for some hypothetical other being. More intelligence will tend to make individuals happier, since… with some exceptions, when we get more ways to manipulate information, we can take them (if they help) or leave them (if they don&#039;t). But now I need to go back and remind myself what we were talking about. Ah, you said that as a society we tend to think that more intelligence is better, and I guess you meant for whole species or larger groups of living things. Well, I do think if a species could get more intelligent without having to lose brain space or burn more calories for it, that would probably help that species do better, whatever kind of thing it might be. Do you disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Part of what makes big brains risky is you get to have so many fewer of them that extinction is more likely.&quot; That&#039;s a good observation. And it&#039;s the fact that big brains use up resources that limits them, right? I guess here it&#039;s not just the energy necessary to build and maintain the brains, but also the space they take up in an egg or womb. So if intelligence is inherently better, it&#039;s with &quot;all other things being equal,&quot; which of course they aren&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take your point that our capacity for culture and language came from relatively small genetic changes and that our brains aren&#039;t all -that- different from the brains of other vertebrates, but the consequences of those differences were unusually vast. &quot;Does language make us much more intelligent? No,&quot; you write. By saying &#039;much&#039;, you indicate that in some way, language itself does make us more intelligent, if only a little. I find that interesting, in a Sapir-Whorf kind of way. I&#039;d think that if something like metabolizing alcohol counts as intelligence, the sort of transformation language has on our thoughts does make us much more intelligent, since it lets us do so many new things and also lets us think in so many new ways. I mean, it&#039;s hard to know for sure, since I can&#039;t erase language from my mind and try thinking about the same things I&#039;m used to thinking about. But, if I can solve a tricky puzzle that a gorilla can&#039;t solve, I&#039;d bet language would have a lot to do with it. Even if I haven&#039;t learned the answer from someone else, I may have talked it out in my own head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with your warning about LLMs, though, and how they&#039;re -all- language and therefore not really smarter than animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, preserving parts of nature is in our selfish best interest. But it also makes sense to do more than preserve: to allow nature&#039;s designs a certain precedence over the world, and to let it keep designing sustainable systems. Does that mean we don&#039;t have the right to control nature? I guess that&#039;s a valid way to put it. I tend to balk at statements about who has the right to do things or doesn&#039;t have the right to do things, because it seems to me that until society agrees, we&#039;re just arguing about whether someone &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have the right, and not whether they actually do; and also because having (or not having) a particular right can be taken in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/what-intelligence-is-not/comment-page-1/#comment-338&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Constructive criticism is always welcome and appreciated! As you say, it can be very helpful. Especially true this time, since you’ve inspired many long responses.  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

“Did intelligence evolve steadily?” In a word, no. This was actually one of the biggest early criticisms against Darwin’s theory. The reality in the fossil record seems to be “punctuated equilibrium.” That is, evolution tends to happen in fits and spurts with long periods of no change in between. As you say, though, the maximum intelligence on this planet probably does trend upwards (I meant to suggest this when I said more complicated life takes longer to evolve), and species losing intelligence once they gain it is somewhat uncommon. I think when intelligence is lost, it’s more often from suddenly not having enough calories and going extinct, rather than scaling back brains to save calories, but I’m no expert on that.

Kinda tangential, but: we’re really bad at measuring intelligence. There are lots of problems with IQ, but one of its quirks is that it’s a relative scale. If you were to track average IQ over time, you’d get a flat line, since the average IQ score for a given year is 100, by definition.

“Transmuting sugar into alcohol is intelligence?” Yes! This is one of the biggest blind spots we have for intelligence. There are &lt;i&gt;so many&lt;/i&gt; substances and mechanisms that life at our scale depends on that are only ever made or unmade by microbes. You need a microbiome to digest your food. Plants need fungi in their roots and nitrogen fixing bacteria to get nutrients from the soil and the air. Plants need chloroplasts and animals need mitochondria, both of which were once free-living microbes but have become symbionts living inside our very cells! The molecular alchemy of microbes is foundational to all of life, and it’s a kind of intelligence that larger species never evolved for themselves, because they can get it through partnerships. &lt;i&gt;Most&lt;/i&gt; of the critical machinery for “terraforming” this planet and surviving here was invented by microbes.

“I think more intelligence is better. Just like more strength and more health and more agility are better.” That’s fair, but behind this lies a value judgment. What does “better” mean for a species, and how do we measure “success”? I suggested sheer biomass as one measure of success, but you didn’t seem to like that one. Your assertion seems to suggest more centralized power is the goal. More personal intelligence and physical prowess is good for making large changes in the world and outcompeting others. Is that better? We’re socialized to think so, but why? For the record, I personally don’t think there is any &quot;natural&quot; goal for us or any species. It’s up to us to choose what to value, I just think we should do that thoughtfully.

You’re right to point out that the human-caused problems I mention are the results of our success, and that other successful (but less intelligent) species have also had global scale harms. Most notably, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event”&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;The Great Oxidation Event&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps I should think of a better example for why big brains are a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It’s a little hard, though, just because other species live so differently! Like, being a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; plant or microbe is a very risky lifestyle because you have so little control over your circumstances, but it’s a very low-risk lifestyle &lt;i&gt;in aggregate&lt;/i&gt;, when you take into account the vast colonies these species tend to make. Part of what makes big brains risky is you get to have so many fewer of them that extinction is more likely.

You make another good point that many, perhaps &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; species create intelligent systems in the world that get passed down outside of genetics. Human culture is just one example of that more general trend, but it’s an extreme outlier! Language lets us export and import whole systems of thought from our minds with high fidelity, and preserve them across generations. That’s a big deal, no doubt. But in terms of individual intelligence and complexity, it’s a very small step with big consequences. I want to emphasize the “small step” part, but not to deny the “big consequences” part. Does language make us much more intelligent? No. But, it does allow us to create and use stores of cultural knowledge that &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; make us much more intelligent.

As an aside, I think there’s something important to say here about LLMs. We’re so impressed with them because they have mastered &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; intelligent skill: language. If we think of language as the thing that sets us apart from animals, that suggests that LLMs, too, are “smarter than animals,” but this is misleading. LLMs lack all the other kinds of intelligence, which means they can’t do all sorts of smart things that animals can. They can’t even reap the full benefits of language use, because they can’t meaningfully integrate into our society. They can’t use our ideas to furnish their minds and lifestyles, because they don’t have such things. So, again, I feel like language can be a bit of a red herring. It’s powerful, but that power mostly depends on what you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; with it, and it does not supersede embodied intelligence.

Lastly, I’m a little surprised by this statement, though I find it very insightful: “do we NEED to justify excluding and exploiting nature? Having to justify something implies there’s been an objection raised.” You’re right. Part of the problem here is that we’ve gotten very used to the idea that humans &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; dominate the planet, and most people don’t question it. That’s what we have been doing for a long time. It’s been supercharged in recent centuries, but even going back hundreds of thousands of years it&#039;s what people tend to do. Yet, we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; tell stories that justify it. Why? I think because domination is violent, and in every age there are people who look at that violence against nature with disgust and wonder what gives us the right. In other words, people &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; object, perhaps because they believe the rest of nature objects, too, we just don’t respect that objection because it’s not presented in human language.

And I think that’s valid. Certainly, I don’t think we should &lt;i&gt;assume&lt;/i&gt; we have this right and ought to fully exercise it, consequences be damned. That seems to be causing a great deal of suffering (think factory farming) and destruction (think climate crisis), and for what? Increased concentration of power? Again, what is our criteria for “success” of our species? What are we going for? No matter what, you’re right, preserving parts of nature would be in our selfish best interest. But there’s something wrong with that perspective, too.

Natural intelligence is bottom up. Life grows in a trillion directions, each individual doing its own thing, and collectively this leads to greater intelligence, flourishing, robustness, and stability. That’s not just “how it is,” that’s an evolved strategy that is &lt;i&gt;highly effective&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;highly intelligent&lt;/i&gt; while also being simple, low-power, and very difficult to disrupt. Human society is top down. We decide how things should be, and impose our will on the world, at scale and at great cost. So, we have this notion that we can pick and choose what life we allow to exist, based on what’s useful to us. But can we? Can we design a healthy ecosystem by selecting which species to preserve, or is such a task too complex? Can we maintain the diversity we need for survival and sustainability, or is it impossible to anticipate our future needs? Perhaps more importantly: why is this our role to play? I’d argue nature is much better at designing sustainable systems, and we’d be better off letting it do its thing and designing our societies &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; that, but we’re stubbornly resistant. We don’t even want weeds and bugs in our yards.]]></description>

It&#039;s not like living in a village were one guy knows how to forge a cauldron and one lady knows how to weave a sweater, and even if I don&#039;t personally have those skills, I can watch them using them and imagine getting them.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my comments this time will mainly take the form of pushing back! I hope that&#039;s okay. I&#039;ve noticed sometimes that when I argue against some of your blog points, it leads to your clarifying your core position--&quot;The main point I wanted to make was…&quot; Perhaps that&#039;s a helpful place to arrive at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spidermonkey have a yom fruit to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did intelligence evolve steadily? As far as I know, it was steady, yes. It would be hard to take the IQ of the smartest living being at any given biological period and graph it against time to check. Even that might not do it--maybe a better way of measuring whether life&#039;s intelligence has grown would be to take the average intelligence of every organism in the world, which, yikes. Even if you could put a number on every creature&#039;s intelligence (which is something you&#039;ve been squarely against in your &quot;What intelligence is not&quot;-type posts), one might not want to go with a straight arithmetic mean in this case. BUT… I do have a sense that the smartest living organisms have been smarter and smarter over time, with no obvious huge jumps I&#039;m aware of except maybe our own ascent. Do you know that to be false? I imagine that sometimes creatures evolve to have lower intelligence, much like creatures sometimes lose senses that they aren&#039;t using much. What would be a good familiar example, though? Like… a turkey is less intelligent than an archaeopteryx, maybe? Snakes may be less intelligent than the first reptiles? Drops in intelligence would presumably be adaptive in order to save calories, but I don&#039;t remember hearing that story very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? Transmuting sugar into alcohol is a form of intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[W]e tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case. Some of the simplest, dumbest organisms on Earth are also the most successful.&quot; Well, this is assuming that the only measurement for quality is how profligate your species is. This reminds me of one time I was a child, riding in a car with some other children, and one of my sister&#039;s friends noticed a cow out the window and said something like &quot;I wish I were a cow. They seem happy and they don&#039;t have to think.&quot; This led to some discussion about happiness and whether intelligence is better. Well, most people (including Ogden Nash) would not prefer to be a cow, regardless of whether they might be free-range or content or safe from butchery. Why is that? Well, what would it mean for ME to be a cow? Aside from bodily changes, it would mean taking my more complex human mental life and stripping most of it away. That seems really sad and a lot like death. In short, intelligence is better for us intelligent things, and lack of intelligence is probably better for less intelligence things, because it&#039;s better, in a preferential sense, for most creatures to remain about how they are. To change too drastically would be, in a way, not to exist anymore at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you can adjust your level of intelligence without dramatically changing the sort of being you are, I think more intelligence is better. Just like more strength and more health and more agility are better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human intelligence has caused a lot of problems for the planet, true. But those problems tend to be the result of runaway success. We spread out so much that we started to fight for land and wage wars. We dominated other living things so much that we wiped out species and ecosystems and are damaging the world&#039;s climate. How to deal with tremendous and sudden biological success is an unsolved problem. But… if some other species somehow outcompeted and dominated the planet&#039;s other living things to a similar extent WITHOUT intelligence… wouldn&#039;t they have caused most of the same problems, but without the wherewithal to hold back and start doing things like protecting parts of the natural world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems hard to make the argument that dolphins might secretly be more intelligent than us, since that seems to be acknowledging that there&#039;s some way to reliably compare intelligence between species in different biomes, but also saying that intelligence is obscured by its existence in different biomes. What universal intelligence metric could dolphins beat us on that we haven&#039;t essentially tried? There are specific tests they could beat us on that might be called kinds of intelligence… maybe recognizing tonal pitch? Maybe some form of social intelligence? But where would one find the argument that these niche-seeming metrics are where &#039;real&#039; intelligence lies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s an interesting thing to say that our society, rather than our intelligence, sets us apart from other species. Comparing an unsocialized, wild human barely managing to scrape by to a dolphin or octopus or some social primate does seem to make a stark point. Yet… lots of species, really every species, have environmental conditions they depend on in order to thrive. Being social is one of ours. Isn&#039;t it fair to say that our propensity for passing knowledge to each other, our command of language and culture, are biological features that make us more intelligent? At the least, it would seem that they&#039;re biological features that give us the potential to be much more intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, some other species can co-exist with us without language. But the plants and animals that occupy our cities are the lucky ones, which I&#039;ve heard called &#039;clean-up species&#039;, that outcompete everything else in a human-occupied setting and reduce overall biodiversity. (Yes, not everyone lives in a city-like environment.) The creatures that are good at existing with us are the ones we have a much easier time co-existing harmoniously with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Or, we can perpetuate the myth that we are special to justify excluding and exploiting nature instead.&quot; Some people do this, certainly--it seems like a dated narrative to me, but it&#039;s a familiar one. The thing is… do we NEED to justify excluding and exploiting nature? Having to justify something implies there&#039;s been an objection raised that needs to be overcome--so, what objection are we assuming is present here, that the justification of being superintelligent is overcoming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Similarly, if anything less than human is just a dumb resource for us to exploit, why not pave the planet? What’s wrong with processing all of that biomass, every living thing on Earth, into fuel and plastics?&quot; For one thing, we need other living things to live. More to the point, though, we also benefit spiritually, scientifically, healthwise and culturally from having thriving ecologies exist. In the absence of thriving ones, semi-thriving, semi-constructed ecologies are better than collapsed ones. You can say it&#039;s because life has the right to exist and we&#039;re not special, or you can say we should preserve a good chunk of nature because that&#039;s the BEST way to exploit it. It&#039;s more varied, more sustainable, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think my comments this time will mainly take the form of pushing back! I hope that&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ve noticed sometimes that when I argue against some of your blog points, it leads to your clarifying your core position&#8211;&#8220;The main point I wanted to make was…&#8221; Perhaps that&#8217;s a helpful place to arrive at.</p>
<p>Spidermonkey have a yom fruit to eat.</p>
<p>Did intelligence evolve steadily? As far as I know, it was steady, yes. It would be hard to take the IQ of the smartest living being at any given biological period and graph it against time to check. Even that might not do it&#8211;maybe a better way of measuring whether life&#8217;s intelligence has grown would be to take the average intelligence of every organism in the world, which, yikes. Even if you could put a number on every creature&#8217;s intelligence (which is something you&#8217;ve been squarely against in your &#8220;What intelligence is not&#8221;-type posts), one might not want to go with a straight arithmetic mean in this case. BUT… I do have a sense that the smartest living organisms have been smarter and smarter over time, with no obvious huge jumps I&#8217;m aware of except maybe our own ascent. Do you know that to be false? I imagine that sometimes creatures evolve to have lower intelligence, much like creatures sometimes lose senses that they aren&#8217;t using much. What would be a good familiar example, though? Like… a turkey is less intelligent than an archaeopteryx, maybe? Snakes may be less intelligent than the first reptiles? Drops in intelligence would presumably be adaptive in order to save calories, but I don&#8217;t remember hearing that story very often.</p>
<p>Really? Transmuting sugar into alcohol is a form of intelligence?</p>
<p>&#8220;[W]e tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case. Some of the simplest, dumbest organisms on Earth are also the most successful.&#8221; Well, this is assuming that the only measurement for quality is how profligate your species is. This reminds me of one time I was a child, riding in a car with some other children, and one of my sister&#8217;s friends noticed a cow out the window and said something like &#8220;I wish I were a cow. They seem happy and they don&#8217;t have to think.&#8221; This led to some discussion about happiness and whether intelligence is better. Well, most people (including Ogden Nash) would not prefer to be a cow, regardless of whether they might be free-range or content or safe from butchery. Why is that? Well, what would it mean for ME to be a cow? Aside from bodily changes, it would mean taking my more complex human mental life and stripping most of it away. That seems really sad and a lot like death. In short, intelligence is better for us intelligent things, and lack of intelligence is probably better for less intelligence things, because it&#8217;s better, in a preferential sense, for most creatures to remain about how they are. To change too drastically would be, in a way, not to exist anymore at all.</p>
<p>But if you can adjust your level of intelligence without dramatically changing the sort of being you are, I think more intelligence is better. Just like more strength and more health and more agility are better.</p>
<p>Human intelligence has caused a lot of problems for the planet, true. But those problems tend to be the result of runaway success. We spread out so much that we started to fight for land and wage wars. We dominated other living things so much that we wiped out species and ecosystems and are damaging the world&#8217;s climate. How to deal with tremendous and sudden biological success is an unsolved problem. But… if some other species somehow outcompeted and dominated the planet&#8217;s other living things to a similar extent WITHOUT intelligence… wouldn&#8217;t they have caused most of the same problems, but without the wherewithal to hold back and start doing things like protecting parts of the natural world?</p>
<p>It seems hard to make the argument that dolphins might secretly be more intelligent than us, since that seems to be acknowledging that there&#8217;s some way to reliably compare intelligence between species in different biomes, but also saying that intelligence is obscured by its existence in different biomes. What universal intelligence metric could dolphins beat us on that we haven&#8217;t essentially tried? There are specific tests they could beat us on that might be called kinds of intelligence… maybe recognizing tonal pitch? Maybe some form of social intelligence? But where would one find the argument that these niche-seeming metrics are where &#8216;real&#8217; intelligence lies?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting thing to say that our society, rather than our intelligence, sets us apart from other species. Comparing an unsocialized, wild human barely managing to scrape by to a dolphin or octopus or some social primate does seem to make a stark point. Yet… lots of species, really every species, have environmental conditions they depend on in order to thrive. Being social is one of ours. Isn&#8217;t it fair to say that our propensity for passing knowledge to each other, our command of language and culture, are biological features that make us more intelligent? At the least, it would seem that they&#8217;re biological features that give us the potential to be much more intelligent.</p>
<p>Yes, some other species can co-exist with us without language. But the plants and animals that occupy our cities are the lucky ones, which I&#8217;ve heard called &#8216;clean-up species&#8217;, that outcompete everything else in a human-occupied setting and reduce overall biodiversity. (Yes, not everyone lives in a city-like environment.) The creatures that are good at existing with us are the ones we have a much easier time co-existing harmoniously with!</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, we can perpetuate the myth that we are special to justify excluding and exploiting nature instead.&#8221; Some people do this, certainly&#8211;it seems like a dated narrative to me, but it&#8217;s a familiar one. The thing is… do we NEED to justify excluding and exploiting nature? Having to justify something implies there&#8217;s been an objection raised that needs to be overcome&#8211;so, what objection are we assuming is present here, that the justification of being superintelligent is overcoming?</p>
<p>&#8220;Similarly, if anything less than human is just a dumb resource for us to exploit, why not pave the planet? What’s wrong with processing all of that biomass, every living thing on Earth, into fuel and plastics?&#8221; For one thing, we need other living things to live. More to the point, though, we also benefit spiritually, scientifically, healthwise and culturally from having thriving ecologies exist. In the absence of thriving ones, semi-thriving, semi-constructed ecologies are better than collapsed ones. You can say it&#8217;s because life has the right to exist and we&#8217;re not special, or you can say we should preserve a good chunk of nature because that&#8217;s the BEST way to exploit it. It&#8217;s more varied, more sustainable, and so on.</p>

Well said!

There is a real difference between people and other animals. It appears like an enormous gulf because our culture has had so long to evolve, but biologically it&#039;s a small and subtle difference. Even your example of teaching language and tool use to animals is instructive. They &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; seem capable of / interested in using these things like people do. But people collaborate with animals &lt;i&gt;all the time&lt;/i&gt;, often using tools and language. The animal side of the collaboration doesn&#039;t look like the human one, but when we meet other animals on their terms, they&#039;re very intelligent, and they can fit into our society, providing benefit to others and receiving support in return. So, this thing that animals lack (whatever it is) is quite small, and it doesn&#039;t have to exclude them as much as we tend to think.

This line of thought brought to you by my childhood growing up on a farm.  ;)

It really blows my mind that we seem to have an unbroken chain of cultural transmission going back to the first humans, and I love to think of culture as a separate thing and a different kind of intelligence than our human minds. It makes that gap between people and animals look different. You can imagine when it was small, and then watch it grow as our society grew, a collective &quot;mind&quot; that we&#039;ve been carrying with us and developing for hundreds of thousands of years.]]></description>

&lt;p&gt;I love this take (predictably). It&#039;s a healthy dose against misleading dichotomies. But I think it&#039;s useful even for those who still ask, &quot;But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; it that makes us humans different?&quot;. I think you take an important step toward an answer: our development in a social community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m constantly fascinated by imagining just how little I would understand if I were raised by apes or wolves. I could not be nearly as &quot;smart&quot; if my knowledge were not bootstrapped by my parents, teachers, peers, and the entire social fabric. So there&#039;s something very peculiar about our social structure / communities / niche-building / meme exchange(??). But at the same time, we&#039;ve tried to teach language and tool use to apes and dogs and have seen only extremely limited adoption. So there&#039;s also something very peculiar about our brains/bodies that allows us to be shaped by the society and access the social knowledge in a way other species can&#039;t. I feel that this is at the crux of our particular flavor of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often think about this fact: &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; man-made tool that exists on Earth was created with some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; man-made tool, going &lt;em&gt;all the way back&lt;/em&gt; to the first chipped rocks and broken sticks. I&#039;m blown away every time I think about this and I can&#039;t quite comprehend it. Our &quot;intelligence&quot; is actually a living infrastructure that has been built over many millennia. It&#039;s embodied in our tools and our social order just as much as it&#039;s in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
