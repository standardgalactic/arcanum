&lt;p&gt;Ah, now that you describe the computer version of descriptive versus generative genomes, I see that having a genome directly describe a body isn&#039;t so weird a notion when it comes to simulation. That&#039;s what you were doing in the simplest level of your original Game of Life project, isn&#039;t it? Starting with an 8x8 pattern that both represents an organism and is literally that organism&#039;s shape, as well as its own environment. And yes, it makes sense intuitively that a description of how to make the thing would respond better to changes than changing individual parts. &quot;Make the femur an inch longer&quot; is much more likely to help than &quot;Turn this particular millimeter of the femur into muscle.&quot; Much like in baking, randomly amending a recipe by increasing the bake time by ten minutes is much more likely to help than taking the food out of the oven during Minute 38 and putting it in the fridge instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your summary of the state of knowledge regarding how developing body parts know when to stop developing. I hadn&#039;t thought of it being triggered by time rather than spatial dimensions, but it makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

You&#039;re right that it&#039;s pretty clear the genome doesn&#039;t literally describe a body, but in the early days of evolutionary algorithms, that&#039;s how we did it. What we&#039;ve found is it doesn&#039;t work very well. Making some tiny change to a literal description of a body usually breaks things. However, if we use what&#039;s called a &quot;generative encoding,&quot; where the genes describe how to &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; a body, then maybe that small change controls something meaningful (like the length of a leg) and is more likely to be neutral or beneficial, so evolution will progress faster. This is the insight I&#039;m talking about. You&#039;re right, it&#039;s kinda obvious biologically, but it took a long time to figure out how to do it in a computer. Now I&#039;m saying, &quot;Yes, a generative encoding! But &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; shouldn&#039;t define that encoding. We should find a way to evolve that part, too!&quot;

How does a leg know to stop growing? Believe it or not, this is still an open question to science. But I know some partial answers. The classic one, which is talked about a bit in &lt;i&gt;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&lt;/i&gt;, is timed gene expression and chemical sensing. Cells coordinate by using chemical signals, either generated by their neighbors (hey, we&#039;re all &quot;handing&quot; right now, join in!) or by the endocrine system (hey, it&#039;s puberty time, time for a growth spurt!) These trigger patterns of growth and stopping that are very precisely timed. They run for a certain amount of time. Different cells grow at particular rates and delays relative to one another. This plays a big role. A newer discovery is the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XheAMrS8Q1c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;bioelectric fields&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that the body produces a global pattern of electricity that in some way maps out the shape and limits of the body. Cells sense this, and use it to guide their growth. But, seriously, how bodies grow is spectacularly complicated and we definitely haven&#039;t figured it all out.

Yes, large language models are a kind of deep learning.  :)  There are too many names for this stuff!

I think there probably is some of that &quot;sub-contracting&quot; that you describe, but I think of &quot;gut feelings&quot; a little differently. Kind of the opposite, actually. My perspective is that life has had preferences, made decisions, and felt a drive to act since it was a single cell. That sort of intelligence has been further developed and complexified by the evolution of bodies and then, eventually, very late in the game, brains. So, I don&#039;t think the brain is primarily responsible for those things, though its cognitive insights certainly play a big role in influencing them. I see the brain as a tool for the body. The body knows what its physical needs are, and feels an urge to act. It defers to the brain to interpret a situation (and thus how to feel about it), decide what action to take (by imagining how it would feel in various scenarios), and how to implement that action (how the cells of the body should prepare and behave). That said, this is also relatively uncharted territory for science. What&#039;s clear is that the mind and body are both involved, and interact in complex ways.

Yes, you&#039;re right, evolution is about both problem solving and problem finding. I emphasized problem finding, because it&#039;s often neglected, and because I believe it&#039;s more important in the long run. What use is problem solving if you haven&#039;t found the right problem? How can a species survive without constantly adapting as the problem landscape changes? But, ultimately, the purpose of finding a problem is to solve it and reap the benefits.

Your to-do list is a great example! I think life tries to strike this balance at many levels. Building that into your plans is good for you and your brain!

Regarding the algorithm: that&#039;s what I&#039;m working on! To be perfectly honest, I&#039;m still trying to understand what I built better by dissecting it, rebuilding it, and describing it in fine detail. If all goes well, I&#039;ll have much more to say, once I&#039;ve identified what &quot;really matters&quot; to this program.

Enjoy your bike adventure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Nate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the question of “what if the genome doesn’t literally describe the body, but instead describes how to make a body?” I feel like this is a semantic issue, a matter of dissecting the meaning of &#039;description&#039; or decoding something, and I don&#039;t see how it could be at the heart of much research. I mean, clearly nothing in a genome is in the shape of an leg, for example. A little less clearly but still pretty clear is that whatever genes lead to a leg developing wouldn&#039;t work properly in a different genetic context. The fact that cells have different chemical makeups that lock and unlock various genetic markers (and other mechanisms like that) and are therefore also part of the story is well enough known that I knew it. I guess the idea of the cell evolving along with the genome is novel to me, if not exactly surprising if you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related point, I&#039;m not done reading Endless Forms Most Beautiful yet (I keep setting it aside), but one thing I wanted out of that book was a sense of how some member like an animal&#039;s leg &#039;knows&#039; how to stop growing at a certain length. While it&#039;s described how an embryo divides into sections destined to grow into particular things, I don&#039;t yet recall getting an answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t really know how deep learning works, but I get the idea it&#039;s similar to large language models, in that it centers around relating concepts to each other. Is that fair to say? If so, then yes, it totally ignores the stimuli that incite and define concepts in the first place. Including gut feelings, and also including the subtleties of sensory stimulus in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a &#039;gut feeling&#039; is an odd one, now that I think about it. Meaning, something like a sense of &quot;I feel queasy about this in my stomach--maybe we shouldn&#039;t actually do it.&quot; Does that mean we sometimes use our stomachs as mini-brains for judging how safe things are? Hmmm. It&#039;s like… the brain uses chemicals to influence its own processes, but sometimes it needs to send chemicals further afield and subcontract out to other parts of the body to get a fuller picture, which they then dutifully send back to the brain for (conscious or subconscious) processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would take some convincing to buy your position that the brain couldn&#039;t &quot;decide on anything without the body for guidance,&quot; though, aside from the fact that &quot;It also depends on the body for perceiving and interacting with the world.&quot; By which I mean, I doubt the brain needs to externally subcontract &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; decision it makes to another part of the body. We have a lot in our memories, for example, to sift through when it comes to making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wrote originally that &quot;…evolution isn’t about problem &lt;em&gt;solving&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about problem &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt;. Life explores the space of possible lifestyles to find and exploit opportunities.&quot; If the model you describe is accurate in which there&#039;s &quot;a tradeoff between &#039;exploration&#039; and &#039;exploitation,&#039;&quot; then… well, it seems to contradict what you said. If finding that perfect balance between exploration and exploitation is the key, then it sounds like evolution is about both problem solving and problem finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reminds me of personal development, really. I&#039;m tackling a to-do list this week, and those lists, in order to have a good balance, should have some exploratory or skill-building elements and some straightforward work that involves the skills one already has. For example, I&#039;ll be doing some writing on pre-existing projects, but I&#039;m also about to go out and try to rent an electric bike for the first time. Whee! Maybe it&#039;s something I can &#039;exploit&#039; in the future, or maybe it won&#039;t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the way your algorithm&#039;s search space shrinks and grows to be interesting. So it opens one dimension at a time, then narrows it down to something manageable? I&#039;d like to hear more about how that works, and why you chose that architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, time to hunt down a rentable bike! Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2024/07/03/why-the-game-of-life-paper/comment-page-1/#comment-274&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

I like your suggestion that this is second- or third-order evolution that I&#039;m studying. I&#039;m not sure, though, because I&#039;m still trying to put a finer point on how my approach differs from others! Most of the work on &quot;evolvability&quot; so far seems related to the question: &quot;what if the genome doesn&#039;t literally describe the body, but instead describes how to &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; a body?&quot; That&#039;s pretty cool and important, but I&#039;m asking a different question: &quot;what if the genome doesn&#039;t mean anything at all, but form and behavior emerges from the interaction of co-evolving cell and genes?&quot;

I must admit, I do have a bias towards anthropomorphism. Or, more precisely, the intentional stance. I think evolution is how life became purposeful and self-directed, so I think it&#039;s actually valid and useful to apply those terms in the context of early evolution, even if what early life did was the simplest possible version of that, and under the hood it&#039;s all just deterministic physics.

Deep learning is pretty cool, but I think it&#039;s important to remember: it couldn&#039;t possibly exist on its own. What brains and deep learning systems do is model, predict, and guide the systems they observe. They don&#039;t really do anything on their own. For instance, I strongly suspect that what makes people want to do things or decide whether something is good or bad is literally &quot;gut feelings,&quot; coming from the body. The brain is important for triggering those bodily sensations in appropriate contexts, and interpreting them when they show up, but I don&#039;t think it could decide on anything without the body for guidance. It also depends on the body for perceiving and interacting with the world. There&#039;s so much &quot;infrastructure&quot; that&#039;s needed for a brain to be useful. That had to evolve first, and in some ways its much more complicated and intelligent than a brain.

In the study of adaptive systems, there&#039;s often talk of a tradeoff between &quot;exploration&quot; and &quot;exploitation.&quot; Basically, if you find an opportunity, you could stop looking and spend all your energy exploiting that opportunity, or you could keep exploring to try and find an even &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; opportunity. Usually you want a balance between these strategies, but the right balance depends on context. Also, different algorithms do better at different parts of this. Deep learning is great at exploitation, because it uses gradient descent to hone right in on the opportunities it finds. It&#039;s less good at finding all the possible alternatives. Traditional evolutionary algorithms are great at exploration, but not that &quot;honing in&quot; part. My hope is to make an evolutionary algorithm that&#039;s good at both, and at finding a suitable balance between them.

I think you have a good idea of what sort of test cases I want to build! Combinations of diverse tasks. Perhaps even combinations that shift over time or space! This may be challenging for me to build and for my algorithm to navigate. But I have a hunch that my algorithm &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be able to do this, and if so, I need a way to test it.

You know, now that you mention it, my algorithm is actually a mix of expanding / restricting the search space. I give my simulated life an unconstrained search space, but then the first thing it does is narrow that space down to some random, tiny segment of what&#039;s possible. Then, over time, it gradually adds more &lt;i&gt;dimensions&lt;/i&gt; to the search space. This opens up new possibilities, but also creates new ways to constrain. For instance, if it adds a new dimension that says, &quot;stretch out whatever pattern evolves&quot; then the constraint would be &quot;how far should I stretch / squash the pattern?&quot; Or if it&#039;s &quot;repeat the pattern in a line,&quot; the constraint might be &quot;what line and how many repetitions?&quot; I think this has a very interesting resemblance to natural evolution.]]></description>

<p>I like your suggestion that this is second- or third-order evolution that I&#8217;m studying. I&#8217;m not sure, though, because I&#8217;m still trying to put a finer point on how my approach differs from others! Most of the work on &#8220;evolvability&#8221; so far seems related to the question: &#8220;what if the genome doesn&#8217;t literally describe the body, but instead describes how to <i>make</i> a body?&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty cool and important, but I&#8217;m asking a different question: &#8220;what if the genome doesn&#8217;t mean anything at all, but form and behavior emerges from the interaction of co-evolving cell and genes?&#8221;</p>
<p>I must admit, I do have a bias towards anthropomorphism. Or, more precisely, the intentional stance. I think evolution is how life became purposeful and self-directed, so I think it&#8217;s actually valid and useful to apply those terms in the context of early evolution, even if what early life did was the simplest possible version of that, and under the hood it&#8217;s all just deterministic physics.</p>
<p>Deep learning is pretty cool, but I think it&#8217;s important to remember: it couldn&#8217;t possibly exist on its own. What brains and deep learning systems do is model, predict, and guide the systems they observe. They don&#8217;t really do anything on their own. For instance, I strongly suspect that what makes people want to do things or decide whether something is good or bad is literally &#8220;gut feelings,&#8221; coming from the body.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh hello slime mold. It&#039;s time to me to see what this post from a while ago incites me to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your work is complicated, as it seems to me, because it&#039;s about the evolution of evolution, i.e. second-level evolution. But here you describe how people are already studying second-level evolution, but you have insights into how to do it more flexibly. Maybe you&#039;re working on third-level evolution? It&#039;s tricky for me to tell, but yes this is super-intelligent stuff, because the stories of evolution themselves are kind of tricky to tell. It&#039;s so tempting to put them in simplified or anthropomorphized form (&quot;The white fur lets the ermines camouflage themselves&quot; or &quot;sexual reproduction lets a species recombine its traits more efficiently&quot;) instead of spelling everything out literally in terms of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh the romance of deep learning. If deep learning is based on the brain, then this may reflect how the brain is one of evolution&#039;s most efficient successes, because learning is so powerful! It&#039;s a child that outshines its parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If evolution is about problem finding, and it&#039;s also about exploiting opportunities… well, I don&#039;t see how those are complementary, exactly. But I get the sense your methods would do better in an open environment where the researcher is looking for interesting results, rather than the solution to a pre-set problem. And indeed, cellular automata are known for being such environments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say you&#039;ve made an algorithm that can solve several tasks. I guess one way to reward flexible EC algorithms is to score them on a combination of several diverse tasks, a kind of triathlon for evolution programs. Ah, I see you use the term &quot;obstacle course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to me that you let your algorithm learn how to restrict your vast search space, rather than the opposite approach of building up possible genomes by expanding the search space outward from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope your GECCO trip is amazing and memorable!&lt;/p&gt;

Is this the same Matt Craig I went to school with in Louisa?  :)

Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I am heartened, because you are raising &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the right kinds of questions. It&#039;s clear you understand my research, and are fascinated by the same things. I very much hope to explore this in experiments, using endosymbiosis as a model. Assuming I can secure continuous funding, I&#039;ll have a lot more to say on this topic.

I&#039;m starting to think of all life as fundamentally symbiotic. That is, you need a collection of pieces that work together and co-determine each other&#039;s function, fitness, meaning, purpose... however you want to put it. I think this mutual dynamic between organism and environment, symbiont and host, is crucial for the evolution of complex behavior. One part can &quot;riff&quot; off of another, using its support to build something and reach to a new level of complexity and sophistication, which can in turn become support for the other, back and forth in a virtuous cycle. I&#039;m hoping to capture just such a dynamic in my experiments, though this will certainly be quite challenging.]]></description>

&lt;p&gt;Very intriguing and interesting work. In reading the details of your experiments, the one detail which stood out to me most would be how the environmental factors effecting the organism in question, and how they evolve independently from the host, would in turn effect the evolution and adaptation of the host organism and subsequently, it&#039;s behavior and modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It would be interesting to see if the evolution of the surrounding organisms held any significant impact on the overall evolution of the subject of study. Moreover, if the evolution of the environment surrounding the host subject were of particular importance to the variations and subsequent adaptations &quot;chosen&quot; by the host organism. Will these environmental factors impact the host&#039;s decisions, and if so, to what extent? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing your thoughts on this, and further research you&#039;ve conducted in your study!&lt;/p&gt;
