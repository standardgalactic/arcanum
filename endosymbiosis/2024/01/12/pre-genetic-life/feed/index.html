Ooh, I like that a lot! Excellent point about &quot;muddying the waters.&quot; 100% agreed.

Yeah, Assembly Theory is super complicated (I &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; expect most people to get the paper, just sharing to be thorough), and it&#039;s not clear yet how useful it will be. As you say, a chemist can glance at a molecule and make a snap judgment about how complex it is, but only if they know to look for it and know it&#039;s somehow &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; from one of the usual suspects...

I tend to think of viruses as being part of the machine-program complex, as you say. And that complex still uses RNA as a major component, so an RNA virus is still relevant to a DNA-based cell. It just intercepts the process at a different point. But we honestly have no idea. You&#039;re absolutely right that these viruses &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; have arisen in an &quot;RNA-world&quot; type of environment, before DNA ever came into existence. If that&#039;s the case, then the distinction between &quot;virus&quot; and &quot;organism&quot; would have been very blurry at that point. It would all just be RNA molecules and their attendants, mixing and reacting. Who&#039;s to say which one is more &quot;in charge&quot; than the others?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; [...]once life becomes intelligent enough, it can use its own intelligence and preferences to reshape selective pressures and thus reshape whole species.

Yes, we smarties are funny like that!  But in the course of expressing our funny preferences, we disguise that-which-was.  At what point did humans stop being adapted for living naked lives and start being adapted to wearing clothing?  At what point did we start to -depend- on the presence of language?  And more generally speaking, the point I was trying to make is that complex features of life will frequently muddy the tracks they&#039;ve taken to get where they are, eradicating previous ecologies, changing the chemical composition of the environment, and even getting rid of the old small-scale, cellular ways of doing things.  Suddenly everyone&#039;s got mitochondria or whatever rooming with them and everyone acts like it&#039;s totally normal.

The linked paper on Assembly Theory was more complex than I was prepared to grasp... as are a few other descriptions of it on the net.  It seems very new and very bold... and perhaps useful?  I wouldn&#039;t think that judging how complex a molecule is, if you have the molecule sitting in front of you, would be all that hard.  I&#039;d think the hard part in finding shadow life would be finding those complex molecules without knowing their shape in the first place.

It felt to me like RNA viruses seem like remnants from an earlier stage of life, seemingly giving the lie to the idea that all life on Earth came from an injection of life from somewhere else that was already DNA-based.  And the existence of viruses at all seems to counterindicate the idea that such an infusion of life was already cell-based.  But that was my hot take without doing any research at all.  Your interpretation of viruses as programs without computers to run them is intuitive and suggests that they could be a kind of offshoot of the machine-program complex, like a piece of a shattered computer that somehow stayed active, and reduces the strength of this argument, such as it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2024/01/12/pre-genetic-life/comment-page-1/#comment-255&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Some very interesting thoughts! Let me reply one by one.

Viruses are very weird, but some of the ideas in this blog are useful for discussing them. If a cell is an evolved machine with an evolved program (DNA), then a virus is &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; an evolved program. Many people don&#039;t consider them alive because they have just one half of the equation. They don&#039;t do anything until another life form &quot;runs the program.&quot; If you think of life more expansively, though, perhaps it&#039;s more a kind of symbiosis. The virus can&#039;t live on its own, but it can live by uniting with another life form, with a range of positive or negative consequences to the host. I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re getting at regarding what the existence of RNA viruses implies. Could you say more?

The My Little Pony reference is silly, but also relevant, at least to the larger context of this blog. It makes me think of relaxed and artificial selection. That is, if nature normally selects &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; some trait or behavior (being pastel pink attracts predators), but some cultural invention (technology or magic) makes it safe to have that trait, suddenly it can emerge and thrive. It could even become desirable (ponies like bright colors and cutie marks!) and promoted by society (preferential treatment, selective breeding, ritualization) until it&#039;s so strongly selected for that it dominates the population. Similar explanations have been posited for human language, for instance! It illustrates a very important point: once life becomes intelligent enough, it can use its own intelligence and preferences to reshape selective pressures and thus reshape whole species. It&#039;s a powerful idea!

I think the word &quot;shadow biosphere&quot; applies here. I guess that if one existed, we might want to make finer distinctions. Like, separating alien, synthetic, and primordial forms of non-genetic life. But until we know that any of those exist, it feels weird to try to tease them apart.

How would scientists prove that there is no prebiotic / shadow-biosphere life in some sample? That&#039;s a great question. One answer is: you can&#039;t prove a negative. We could always find something weird that needs a new explanation, but if we &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; find it, we can never be sure that we didn&#039;t just miss it. The other big problem with this question is: what is life? Like, scientists are getting good now at sifting through buckets of mixed DNA. If we assume all life has DNA, then they can make definitive statements about whether they can account for all the species in a sample, for instance. But what if there&#039;s non-DNA based life? Well, then we have to look for something else... but what? There are some good guesses at molecules that any life would need, or that we think can&#039;t occur without life making it, but these are just guesses.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06600-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Assembly Theory&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting attempt at quantifying just how complex a process is needed to make a given molecule. They hope to use that to identify signs of extraterrestrial life. The basic idea is that the only way we know for really complex molecules to form in any real quantity is if a living thing makes them. There are a couple of problems with this, though. First you pick a molecule, then you run some &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; slow and costly calculations to figure out how complex it is. So what molecules do we pick to analyze and hunt for? We&#039;re back to a guessing game. In theory, a scientist could catalog every &lt;i&gt;molecule&lt;/i&gt; in a sample, compute their &quot;assembly index,&quot; and see if there&#039;s some unexpected complex molecules in the mix. But we just don&#039;t have the technology to do that, yet. We can&#039;t sort through individual molecules, and we don&#039;t have a computer powerful enough to run the math on some of the macro-molecules we see in nature. In principle it&#039;s possible, though, and the wider a net we cast the more likely we are to find something. Still, no way to know whether something slipped through the gaps in the net.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;Starfish&lt;/i&gt; sounds like fun. I really enjoyed Watts&#039; book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427378315&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Blindsight&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe I&#039;ll have to check that out.

I see what you mean about isolated species, but I&#039;d push back on the word &quot;discrete.&quot; There&#039;s really no clear delineation between species, and the genes of some lost species are still with us thanks to interbreeding. Perhaps it&#039;s better to say that the tree of life is sparse in places?

I so hope that we can find life beyond Earth within our lifetimes! There are few things I can imagine that have such potential to reshape our understanding of what life is, or our place in the universe.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, you detective of first life!  What thoughts will I have for you?  Hopefully I won&#039;t be such a bummer as I was last time.

It&#039;s true, all the living things are super cool DNA hi-tech ultramachines!  Wait.  What about viruses?  Aren&#039;t they an exception somehow?  Okay, I think they have genes, but... not cells?  And do they have actual DNA?  I shall Google and report that... oh.  They come in both kinds.  Come to think of it, I had heard of RNA viruses, but never thought about what their existence implies.  I don&#039;t know which kind there&#039;s more of.  Oh, and retroviruses have both.  Funny.

This mash of viruses suggests that the mystery you point out is not a complete one.  Yes, people debate whether viruses are really living, but maybe that&#039;s related to how... primordial they are?  And it&#039;s that very primordiality that makes them a sort of gateway to a less technologically evolved kind of life.  If nothing else, I would guess that the existence of RNA viruses means that if life did crash into early Earth from some comet or something, it wasn&#039;t already using DNA.

This whole question reminds me, in a silly way, of the question of My Little Ponies.  In the world of the cartoons, there&#039;s this species of sapient equine that come in evolutionarily impractical colors and all have these marks on their rumps indicating their personal passions and capabilities.  Some of them even have magical horns and/or wings.  How is one to imagine this came about?  Maybe some early intelligent horse first somehow tapped into whatever made magic possible, and this led to eventual improvements in which the species made themselves colorful and clean, and eventually gave themselves cutie marks for some useful reason, and it was so adaptive that ordinary coat colors and -not- having cutie marks washed out, and now those early ponies are lost even to antiquity.  Much like versions of ourselves who lack certain features now innately associated with humanity.

It certainly seems most immediately sensible to assume whatever came before the genetic system is long gone.  Casualty to any number of developments, along with many other branches.  But, the idea of it hanging on somewhere where it&#039;s very strong because that&#039;s where it -grew up- is a nifty one.  I&#039;ve heard that archea (formerly archeabaacteria) are super hard to find, and they&#039;re a whole mysterious domain of life!  So, this is a believable circumstance.  If a precursor to DNA-based life is around somewhere, would that be what they call a shadow biosphere?  Or does that term refer only to life that&#039;s completely unrelated to what we know?  If the latter, then it needs its own term.  A shadow bioslum?  An antique biosphere?

How would we be able to take a sample of living and non-living material, however small and with however much time to look through it, and rule out the idea that it has some other, more primordial form of life mixed in with it?  It&#039;s the sort of thing one assumed scientists know how to do.  But maybe they don&#039;t?  If there were such a separate branch of the great living family tree, it seems like they would have to create another entire classification level to put it in, much like they created domains to go above kingdoms, because just giving it a domain or kingdom of its own doesn&#039;t seem like it would be significant enough.]]></description>

Maybe some early intelligent horse first somehow tapped into whatever made magic possible, and this led to eventual improvements in which the species made themselves colorful and clean, and eventually gave themselves cutie marks for some useful reason, and it was so adaptive that ordinary coat colors and -not- having cutie marks washed out, and now those early ponies are lost even to antiquity.  Much like versions of ourselves who lack certain features now innately associated with humanity.</p>
<p>It certainly seems most immediately sensible to assume whatever came before the genetic system is long gone.  Casualty to any number of developments, along with many other branches.  But, the idea of it hanging on somewhere where it&#8217;s very strong because that&#8217;s where it -grew up- is a nifty one.  I&#8217;ve heard that archea (formerly archeabaacteria) are super hard to find, and they&#8217;re a whole mysterious domain of life!  So, this is a believable circumstance.  If a precursor to DNA-based life is around somewhere, would that be what they call a shadow biosphere?  Or does that term refer only to life that&#8217;s completely unrelated to what we know?  If the latter, then it needs its own term.  A shadow bioslum?  An antique biosphere?</p>
<p>How would we be able to take a sample of living and non-living material, however small and with however much time to look through it, and rule out the idea that it has some other, more primordial form of life mixed in with it?  It&#8217;s the sort of thing one assumed scientists know how to do.  But maybe they don&#8217;t?  If there were such a separate branch of the great living family tree, it seems like they would have to create another entire classification level to put it in, much like they created domains to go above kingdoms, because just giving it a domain or kingdom of its own doesn&#8217;t seem like it would be significant enough.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also pretty vexed (or maybe astonished?) when I think about the monopoly of DNA!

This reminds me of the way I feel when I think about the gulf between humans and chimps, and the fact that not a single other hominin or proto-hominin species exists now, even though we know they co-existed for many millennia. It&#039;s unsettling to me. But maybe that&#039;s evidence that this happens all the time, your first hypothesis. After all, species are pretty discrete, rather than being a continuous space. Some are so darn far from their nearest ancestors, like platypi, or cetaceans. The extinct dino grandparents of the birds. They all seem to have their own origin mystery. But way more fun to think of &quot;alien&quot; life hiding amongst us! Actually, have you read Starfish by Peter Watts? Because that novel is exactly about this idea (although that&#039;s kind of a spoiler, sorry).

Also makes me think of another favorite thought experiment of mine: imagining that there is life right there in some of our neighboring planets, we just can&#039;t see it yet. The surface of Venus, the gas clouds of Jupiter, under the ice of Europa... who knows what might be down there?]]></description>

Ooh, good point! That goes nicely with the idea of genetics being a way to escape life&#039;s initial niche. If that niche disappeared, then the discovery of genetics would be one of the essential reasons why life is still around today.]]></description>
