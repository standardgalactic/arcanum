Oh, that&#039;s awesome! Thanks for sharing your experience, Rachel. :)

I&#039;m fascinated by these stories about learning to use and reprogram the body. Growing up, I was never taught this sort of stuff. I was just asked to do physical activities, and if I couldn&#039;t, the other kids would laugh. That was it. I was just expected to do it, or, if not, it was just further proof that I was the &lt;i&gt;worst&lt;/i&gt; kid to pick for your basketball team. No attempt to figure out why I was struggling, no growth mindset talk, no coaching to get better, no motivation except shame. My conclusion was: &quot;well, that sucked. I guess now that gym class is over, I never have to do any of that ever again!&quot;

I wonder if that&#039;s changing? I feel like science has learned a lot about this in the past few decades. I hope some of these ideas are filtering into the general public. I imagine having kids grow up thinking like this is how we&#039;ll start to see real breakthroughs in understanding the body better, and how to make the most of these different learning processes.

I wonder, are we almost to the point where we could publish a helpful &quot;user guide to the human being&quot; that explores all these adaptive processes in body and mind and gives advice on how to manage them? I know were still sorting out some fundamentals, but it&#039;s such a shame that it takes exceptional circumstances for folks to find, explore, and internalize these ideas. Not that you and I are &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; special, but plenty of people never do this.]]></description>

I will admit that it&#039;s very cool on paper.  In any case, I was in a poor state of mind the other day, so it was easy to feel grumpy about how few physical skills it seems like I&#039;ve learned.  But every little familiar motion, like holding a pencil or opening a door, is informed by kinetic learning and maybe also by anti-fragility.

The idea of AI utilizing such concepts is intriguing and seems like a natural step.  I&#039;ll say that in my limited experience with Chat GPT, it did seem to become more fluidly familiar with concepts, moving smoothly past ideas that were stumbling blocks earlier in the conversation.  It reminds me of how my calculus textbook spends more time on basic calculations early on, but in late chapters, it skips commonly encountered steps, assuming the student doesn&#039;t need them explained anymore.  So, somehow, the basic model followed by Chat GPT seems to be simulating a type of learning that seems analogous to the types of bodily learning you&#039;re talking about, but without a body.

I appreciate the perspective of being able to take negative sensations as communication.  I guess the more one knows about the physiological process, the more one can understand and trust those messages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Nate, the other comment is interesting in itself -- I for one (or, rather, for two) also find it fascinating how the body learns. I&#039;ve had a long and unsteady athletic journey from skinny, deeply uncoordinated kid toward some skill in partner acrobatics and handstands, none of which really even STARTED to begin until I started lifting weights as a young adult. Many many years later I read a book called The Out-of-Sync Child, about kids who aren&#039;t very coordinated or otherwise have communication issues between their bodies and brains; when I read that uncoordinated kids are often treated by having them carry heavy weights around, in order to amplify the signals sent by their proprioceptive systems, I had a real aha moment. Like oh wow, weightlifting really did fix me and this was the mechanism, though I had no idea what I was doing.

I have many stories of nonlinear system learning, in which some sequence of muscle firings just felt awful / inefficient / not useful until one day they magically did, and my intellectual understanding was utterly leapfrogged by those moments. There were the first 16 weeks in a row I tried to do weighted squats and they were terrible, followed by the week they felt like a dance and my weight quickly doubled. There was the time I went to PT and learned to fire my glute before my hamstring while walking -- similar to your experience with walking up stairs. I could only FEEL that firing of muscles when I had a therapist literally poking me in each muscle to amplify the signal, but after about 1000 reps of conscious one-and-then-the-other, a faster motion did begin to reverse the unconscious firing order. There was, and this is classic, learning to juggle a standard 3-ball cascade, which notoriously feels overwhelming and out of control until it doesn&#039;t. 

After all these years, I find it difficult to judge to what extent a skill is going to suddenly improve via this sort of process (better signaling, proprioception, something) and to what extent it is going to just improve linearly and grindingly through the more predictable process of muscle growth (or stretching). I&#039;d especially like to know this about press handstands, where I&#039;m still awaiting the breakthrough after many years.

Have you heard the phrase &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together&quot;? Reading up on myelin formation begins to give some notion of how practice works. I liked the book The Talent Code, although it&#039;s pretty old at this point and some of the science may well have been eclipsed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2024/01/03/learning-to-move-three-kinds-of-learning/comment-page-1/#comment-246&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Yeah, sorry this post is less relatable to folks who have a different relationship to fitness. I&#039;m aware that not everyone will feel the same way, or see the same kind of responsiveness in their body. Still, I hope talking about my experience of it may be helpful.

The main reason this made exercise more enjoyable is that I learned to see the discomfort differently. Initially, I saw it as &quot;this sucks&quot; or &quot;my body wants me to stop.&quot; Now I see it as a form of communication. My muscles are constantly telling me about their levels of readiness, strength, mobility, exhaustion, etc., how those things are changing, and how close I am to my physical limits. It&#039;s a kind of communication which conveys a lot of nuance about the body&#039;s state that&#039;s hard to put into words. It sucks that these messages often feel &lt;i&gt;unpleasant&lt;/i&gt;, but it helps to see them as messages to interpret, not just pain. Easier said than done, I know.  :-P

I struggled with dance the same way you struggled with yoga. I think I have an easier time copying someone&#039;s movement (which is why yoga works for me) but I just &lt;i&gt;can not&lt;/i&gt; follow a rhythm. I feel a little bad that I gave up on dance so quickly, but I had such a strong sense of &quot;this isn&#039;t working for me &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;&quot; that I hope I made the right choice. I figure, everyone has to find what works for them...

You don&#039;t think it&#039;s cool that your brain and body have multiple parallel tracks of understanding and adaptation that blend together seamlessly? Or that your mind and body do smart things for you, automatically, without you having to ask or even notice? Man, I think that&#039;s just the coolest. It&#039;s a marvelous machine to study, and it really makes me wonder about my conscious mind, and how it relates to me as a complex whole. Maybe you&#039;re just already used to the idea, or don&#039;t care as much about non-cognitive kinds of intelligence? Part of why I find this so cool is that I&#039;m interested in learning theory and AI technology, which currently don&#039;t account for this sort of thing &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. It&#039;s part of our everyday human experience, common across the tree of life, yet somehow unexplained and often dismissed by folks who claim to have the answers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s see what I have to say about this reflection!

I like the way your images set the scene.

You managed to make exercise more enjoyable by learning how your intelligent processes work together!  I wonder if I could find some way to make exercise more enjoyable.  Sadly, I don&#039;t find it very enjoyable at all!

Yoga has never worked for me at all.  In trying introductory yoga, as well as in learning dances, I found I&#039;m poor at looking at what another person is doing and mimicking it with my own body.  I have to puzzle out verbally which direction they&#039;re doing things in and miss big parts of it.  And how can I perform maneuvers while I&#039;m also looking to see what other people are doing?

Interesting point about climbing stairs.  I don&#039;t think the distinction between ways of climbing stairs had occurred to me before you mentioned it in conversation, but I&#039;d observed there being different ways to perform other types of motions.  This reminds me of the dictum to lift with your legs, not with your back, and also the transition point between walking and running.

Just reading this blog post makes me feel uncomfortable!  My gosh I hate exercising.

So the three types of learning involved are that you learn intellectually how to make movements, and then your cerebellum remembers how to make those movements, and then your tissues (especially muscles) learn how strong they have to be to make them?  I guess it&#039;s interesting to think of muscle growth as a kind of learning that doesn&#039;t involve the brain, and I suppose it&#039;s reasonable to think of that way, similar to plant learning.  But I can&#039;t say I find the combination of these three types of learning fascinating.

I&#039;m having trouble thinking of examples of how I&#039;ve engaged in that &quot;unconscious learning process&quot; that made skills &quot;fully automatic.&quot;  Learning video game controls, I guess.  It must happen all the time to a small extent, but I don&#039;t usually have the patience to practice anything for long enough to make it noticeable.  Repetitive work tasks, I suppose, like the rhythm of moving a supply cart...  I learned a Bach invention on piano when I was 18 and it was like that, but I found it a little scary how fast my fingers moved through the song.  I kind of feel the same way about typing now.
