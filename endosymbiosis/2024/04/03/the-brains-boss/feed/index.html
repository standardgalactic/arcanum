I understand. It&#039;s good to be skeptical when you don&#039;t feel you have a solid grounding. If you ever want to delve into the science on this topic, I did enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427378803&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Self Comes to Mind&lt;/a&gt;, though I think Damásio is far too conservative.

As you note, science has a limited understanding of this topic still, which gives folks license to deny full self-awareness to all but humans (Damásio) and to claim that rocks are conscious (panpsychism). It&#039;s hard to say anything definitive about mental phenomena, sadly.

I don&#039;t know of any good alternative theories about the PFC, either.]]></description>

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m assuming that the role of the PFC as a centralizing hub for aggregating awareness and directing attention is the established science? But the parts about how trainable and how in-control the PFC is seem harder to establish? Unfortunately, this is not something I have a background in. Even in describing what I think is known about the PFC, I have resorted to language from the meditation community... and this is where my nervousness comes from. A lot of what I have come to believe recently is pulled from various spiritual and therapeutic practices, which I am sure have integrated some scientific ideas, while also retaining a bunch of unvalidated folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to know what is missing from a frame, without having alternative frames to consider, and I don&#039;t really. I just have an instinctive nervousness around concepts that feel as though they have become hegemonic, especially if I perceive that broad attunement to have arisen quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, ADHD / ADD is very strongly linked to executive function. Seemingly autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well. They tend to involve ignoring some things while hyper-fixating on others, and often an inability to resist distraction, as well. This is why people often think of these neurological differences as disabilities. Being unable to focus attention in a &quot;normal&quot; way can make it hard to live in society today. Personally, I don&#039;t think of this as something wrong, though. These minds simply have a different balance of capabilities. Sometimes these folks tend to notice things others miss, and some can spend long times completely immersed in very deep, detail-oriented work that others could not do. They are not less than other people, just different.

Some people think the PFC is also critical for consciousness, but that&#039;s not entirely clear. One big problem is that we don&#039;t even have a good definition for what consciousness is. From what I&#039;ve read about neuroscience, even very primitive creatures have integrated self awareness, which is one kind of &quot;consciousness.&quot; Certainly insects do, for instance. Perhaps even plants, fungi, and microbes, though that depends on whether you insist that consciousness requires a brain. The PFC is likely responsible for the heightened autobiographical consciousness that people experience. We know who we are, imagine our past and our future, and have coherent opinions about meaning and purpose and whatnot that insects probably &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; (but birds and mammals probably &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;). That&#039;s the PFC at work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427378803&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Self Comes to Mind&lt;/a&gt; is a good book on this topic, though I think it&#039;s a bit too conservative.

As for Meijer&#039;s theory of consciousness, I wouldn&#039;t take it very seriously. I&#039;ve never heard of NeuroQuantology as a journal, and I&#039;m skeptical that there&#039;s any evidence to support this idea. What&#039;s certainly true is that science has no explanation for why we have conscious experience of our minds. We can sorta explain what the brain does, and why our consciousness is filled with the particular thoughts and feelings that we have, but not why we have a first-hand &lt;i&gt;experience&lt;/i&gt; of our thoughts. This leads some folks to say that consciousness isn&#039;t in the matter. It&#039;s part of the fabric of the universe itself, or it comes from outside the universe. I actually really like the first idea, but I reject any talk of things &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt; our universe, for the simple reason that even if they do exist, they would be beyond our reach and comprehension. The idea that consciousness is projected into our brain from another realm of existence is very old (René Descartes was convinced that the portal was the pineal gland), but there&#039;s never been any evidence. I dislike that idea, because our personality, memory, skills, and so much of what we call the &quot;self&quot; really does seem to be in the brain. If consciousness is something else, then I think it&#039;s what gives us first-hand experience of mental activity, not the source of that activity.]]></description>

Huh. That&#039;s unexpected.

These aren&#039;t new thoughts for me. This has bothered me deeply since I was a teenager, so it&#039;s something I&#039;ve thought about deeply for many years. It&#039;s also inspired by plenty of reading in the realm of neuroscience and psychology, which is also not very recent.

I&#039;m curious. What has changed in your thinking recently? What examples have you seen that make you say there&#039;s a trend here? What might we be obscuring with this narrative?]]></description>
