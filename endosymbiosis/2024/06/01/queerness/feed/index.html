					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2024/06/01/queerness/comment-page-1/#comment-268&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, Thorin! I appreciate your insights as always  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I guess I’m trying to be a bit provocative with my language here, mostly to get people to consider a different perspective. Yes, categories are quite useful, and whether they exist or not mostly depends on your definition of “exist.” I chose not to delve into that, just because it’s so philosophical! It is more precise to talk about “natural kinds,” though that does tend to get sticky when you consider what is “natural.” For instance, philosophers used to think of species as “natural kinds” put here on Earth by divide forces, but I’d prefer to say they &lt;i&gt;aren’t&lt;/i&gt; (and I think most modern philosophers would agree), because they evolve continuously over time. On the other hand, materials like &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;water&quot; really do seem to be natural kinds, and those categories are different from what I&#039;m talking about here.

As to Jews and games and vegetables, I think I agree with you completely. The main point I was trying to convey is exactly what you describe: these things are just fuzzy descriptions that we apply when they are useful. The problem is when people forget this fact. It’s risky to say “Jews believe X” because that’s not true in any absolute sense. It needs a caveat, which is often implied, which means it’s easy to miss. As long as everyone is aware of this fuzziness, labels and categories are great. But many people are not so philosophically literate.

The way society is struggling with transgender identity right now is a good example. People like to make strong statements about what men and women are or do, how they should dress and behave, and where they are allowed to be. As if “men” was a category that’s easy to define, such that we can confidently say “all men are X” and “no men are Y.” The truth is far more messy than that, but some people violently resist changing these categories because they believe they are “real,” and that all people &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be either male &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; female by definition. They believe the exceptions (trans people) must be deluded, perverts, or trying to disrupt the normal function of society when they simply want to be recognized as they are, and given the same access to society as everybody else.

As for turtle pilots, that’s a good example of how categories are useful. A Black woman can certainly be an excellent engineer, but, as far as I know, no turtle can be. It seems that truly 100% of turtles cannot learn the skill. This is one reason why we have the important category “people.” In a fantasy setting where a turtle might be a pilot, they &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be people. The teenage mutant ninja turtles are (fictional) people. In our world, the category “people” is coextensive with “humans,” but that could change, at least in theory.

As for the baggage of labels, I guess there are some that are innocuous enough that there is no significant baggage, but I think that’s pretty rare, actually. Yes, some people proudly identify as “gay,” and yet that label means &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; different things to different people. Gay people like &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; definition of the word, and are proud to embrace it. But by adopting that label, they accept that some people will just assume that they are male, effeminate, promiscuous, amoral, or even pedophiles. Often they do this in order to show people that their stereotypes are &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;. Identifying with a label is often about how you want others to perceive &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, or how you want others to perceive &lt;i&gt;that label&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to see a post from you again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d say asking whether categories are real is like asking whether numbers are real--not really a useful enterprise. Categories are classification tools, as you hint at when you say that labels are &quot;useful&quot; for quick descriptions. As to whether categories have essential qualities… I&#039;m not sure quite what that means, but it reminds me of the idea of natural rights… and for that matter, &#039;natural kinds&#039;, which some philosopher or other that I read in college espoused. I take it to mean, would people stripped of culture and having to start from scratch likely come up with the same rights, kinds, and categories? Certainly some categories are a lot more &#039;natural&#039; in this sense than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you&#039;ve had things assumed about you based on your categorization, and that it&#039;s been frustrating. Sorry about that. I must have experienced the same--it seems vaguely familiar--but I can&#039;t think of any examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to push back on your statement about Jews not existing. As I see it, &#039;Jews&#039; is just short for &#039;Jewish people&#039;. I&#039;ve seen it pointed out that the word &#039;game&#039; is so expansive as to defy any concise definition, and though it might be tempting to step back, take a broader look at all the things called &#039;games&#039;, and come up with a more clever definition, sometimes linguistic drift just makes that impossible, or at least an exercise in sophistry. That may be true for Jews, too… but it certainly doesn&#039;t mean that either games or Jews don&#039;t exist. That phrasing reminds me of a sitcom clip I saw recently in which a character is claiming that &quot;vegetables don&#039;t exist,&quot; on the basis of the fact she can classify any vegetable more specifically as a particular part of the plant. It&#039;s a stalk, or a flower, or a root, etc., but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not also a vegetable, that vegetables don&#039;t exist, or that the category isn&#039;t useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And really, it&#039;s not at all uncommon for people to not fully agree on what counts as an X, but still to get a lot of utility from discussing X&#039;s. People talk about cars, but may disagree on where the boundary between a car and a truck is. Heck, people debate what counts as a sandwich just for fun--should we stop including sandwich sections in menus or cookbooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that encountering a Black woman engineer is rare but not strange. But I think I may disagree with the broader point you may be making. I think it -would- be strange to see, say, a turtle airplane pilot, if I may posit a world of professional animals in order to skirt human stereotypes. Because turtles seem even further than we humans from having anything like a flight instinct. Heck, Cool Runnings was about the beautiful strangeness of a Jamaican bobsled team. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your remark about every label carrying some unwanted baggage is an interesting one. I know there are people who wholeheartedly embrace some labels with pride, and would deny that they have any unwanted baggage… but I think this is generally true. I could fairly be called queer myself, but I don&#039;t tend to embrace the label (and of course &#039;queer&#039; is a label, albeit a broader umbrella term), for subtle reasons I&#039;m not entirely certain of. I think it indeed boils down to baggage I&#039;d rather not have, regardless of how accurate it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
