					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2024/08/07/gecco-follow-up/comment-page-1/#comment-279&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh, sorry for the confusion. The paper and video and such are from the project I&#039;ve already shared and talked about a bunch. This is just the &quot;final form&quot; it took for submitting this paper. So, you&#039;re right, there&#039;s nothing new there.

When I mentioned endosymbiosis, I was talking about where this idea is headed and what I think will come next. I don&#039;t have much to say about it yet, except to say that&#039;s where my mind is at. So, stay tuned for more on that!]]></description>

&lt;p&gt;Hi Nate.  I watched the video without stopping to pause and comprehend it, and I&#039;m afraid I didn&#039;t understand how it was any different from the previous version.  Well, actually, the concept of a Co-evolving Genotype and Genotype/Phenotype map is one I *think* I vaguely understand now, based on reading your overview... and this seems to be the concept that I didn&#039;t grasp from the past version of your project, possibly because it wasn&#039;t emphasized there.  You explained that since genotypes needaed to evolve along with a biological interpretation mechanism (by which I assume you mean RNA and ribosomes), we may as well try evolving these things together in our search for lifelike processes... in our artificial intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&#039;t grasp how your project goes beyond the CGGP model.  If it&#039;s now about endosymbiosis, is the difference that you have two different organisms evolving together, and not just a genotype and an interpreter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry again about the trip falling apart.  I&#039;m glad some forms of your work made it to the conference without out.  Too bad about the time zones being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
