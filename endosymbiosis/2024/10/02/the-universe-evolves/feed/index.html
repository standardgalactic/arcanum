&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops, I can&#039;t directly reply to your reply above, but here&#039;s what I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it can&#039;t be a matter of luck that the universe is understandable. :-) Some of it is intuitive and some definitely isn&#039;t--the moon (and airplanes) in the sky, tectonic plates crunching‚Ä¶ the idea that life wasn&#039;t designed just for us by things like us. You could say, as Hume observed, that it&#039;s lucky that induction works at all, that patterns exist. But a world without patterns would be so utterly different that it feels wrong to say we could exist in it at all. An anthropic argument seems to almost necessitate that the universe has to have rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#039;t mean it has to have rules all the way down. It doesn&#039;t mean that every observable phenomenon has to have a reason it happens. But if there are some weird, complex things that just ARE, and there&#039;s no reason for them‚Ä¶ well, I&#039;d have to wonder, why is THAT the case? I would expect there to be a reason for the lack of reasons. And if there isn&#039;t one, I would expect a reason for the lack of reasons for the lack of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that you&#039;re saying anthropic arguments are unsatisfying only because they aren&#039;t conclusive. Well, lots of arguments are far from conclusive, but they do offer evidence that make some idea (like life on other planets) more or less likely. I think the basic anthropic principle offers something that isn&#039;t evidence, exactly, but is still a form of explanatory power, based on a comparison of hypotheses. One hypothesis is that living worlds are pretty common, and we just haven&#039;t happened to find any yet, and another very different hypothesis is that they&#039;re actually very rare--so rare that if we posit a multiverses of cosmoses, they occur in only a small fraction of those cosmoses, and usually no more than one in each. At first intuition, the second hypothesis may seem pretty unlikely compared to the first one. But the anthropic principle gives the second hypothesis a lot more credence, because it&#039;s no longer possible to use the fact that we have a living world in front of us as direct mathematical evidence against it.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the feedback! That&#039;s helpful.

When you mention the idea that &quot;every possible computation is running somewhere,&quot; you remind me very much of Greg Egan&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427378616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Permutation City&lt;/a&gt;. Ever read that one?  :)]]></description>

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two elements I particularly liked: taking a wider lens on a powerful process or abstraction (like evolution), and deep history (which your post on pre-genetic life also touched on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you get most of the way to ultimate ensemble theory with a different set of assumptions: that the universe is spatially infinite, which suggests every possible Hubble volume would exist somewhere, and that digital minds can be conscious, which suggest every possible computation is running somewhere (perhaps up to some finite limit). That&#039;s all pretty speculative, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a tautological version of anthropic arguments (of course you can&#039;t observe yourself not existing), but I think the interesting but still very tricky version is: &quot;I&#039;m probably a fairly typical observer, so what does that imply about the overall structure of existence?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t personally love the retrocausation idea, but only because I find the idea of a quantum observer to be pretty strange and unnecessary to explain QM.&lt;/p&gt;

I like where you&#039;re going with this &quot;pseudo-existence&quot; idea! Humans have this deep desire for the universe to make intuitive sense to us. We want to &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; it, and we&#039;ve been lucky in that, for the most part, that&#039;s possible. It has allowed us to discover things through inference, using tools like Occam&#039;s Razor. Or, perhaps it has nothing to do with luck. Perhaps we evolved brains that are good at recognizing and interpreting the kind of regularity that exists around us. Perhaps the universe makes sense to us because we evolved to make sense of it! But you&#039;re right that there&#039;s no reason the universe &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; make sense, and perhaps our brains &lt;i&gt;aren&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; evolved to make sense of, say, quantum mechanics. Perhaps there are parts of the universe that are completely beyond our comprehension. But, does that mean the universe &lt;i&gt;really is&lt;/i&gt; arbitrary, messy, and over-complicated, or is simplicity in the eye of the beholder? Perhaps any system can be intuitive, if you have a mind that&#039;s honed to make sense of that system. Perhaps being &quot;intuitive&quot; is just an alignment between the system being observed, and the system doing the observing.

Yes, you understand what I mean by &quot;anthropic arguments.&quot; I think they&#039;re unsatisfying because they don&#039;t actually answer the questions that matter most to us. Why are we here? In part, because &quot;here&quot; is the kind of place where we can be. Sure. That explains why we are not &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;, floating in open space. But it doesn&#039;t actually explain why we are here. There could be vast numbers of Earth-like worlds in our universe. Should we expect to find Earth-like life there? Anthropic arguments can only tell us &quot;maybe.&quot; They can&#039;t explain the specific reasons why we &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; arise here‚Äîthat is, why the possibility of life became the actuality of life. Why is the universe like we see? Because if it weren&#039;t, we wouldn&#039;t see it. But that doesn&#039;t tell us what other possible universes might support life, what other kinds of life are possible, or how this universe came to be supportive of life. It&#039;s one of those arguments that feels both clever and dumb at the same time.]]></description>

Quantum physics is mind-boggling. &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Time&lt;/i&gt; is pretty easy to read, but very hard to grok in its entirety. That&#039;s okay, though. I keep reading more about quantum stuff, and I feel slightly less baffled every time. Maybe I&#039;m just getting used to the befuddlement  ;)

I&#039;m actually reading a lovely (if rather long and technical) paper right now, by some of my favorite researchers (https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/26/9/765). I bring it up because it&#039;s about &quot;adaptability,&quot; and they define it as &quot;learning to solve problems better with experience.&quot; I like this a lot. Perhaps fire can &quot;solve&quot; certain problems. For instance, you could imagine folding an origami shape that represents an optimization problem, such that the speed at which it burns tells you the answer to the problem. But if you did it again, you&#039;d just get the same answer. It would never spontaneously find a &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; answer, or find a better way to &lt;i&gt;compute&lt;/i&gt; the answer with repetition. That would be &quot;non-trivial adaptation,&quot; which is a thing life does, but not most physical systems.

Saying &quot;life is a super-charged way of generating entropy&quot; isn&#039;t very satisfying, in part because lots of processes do this, life&#039;s just &quot;better&quot; at it in some unspecified way. I think people suggest this because it assigns a sort of &quot;purpose&quot; to life that arises out of pure physics. But I like this discussion of &quot;adaptability&quot; better, because it highlights the difference between trivial optimization and learning (which fire or crystals or whatever can do) and the non-trivial kind (which only very particular physical systems with complex inner structure can do). Viruses do this. They get better at hijacking cells with experience. It&#039;s still unclear whether they&#039;re &quot;alive,&quot; though. Perhaps that is the wrong question to ask?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2024/10/02/the-universe-evolves/comment-page-1/#comment-298&quot;&gt;Nate Gaylinn (he/him)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of contemplation I find easily overwhelming, so I like to take it slowly.  It&#039;s news to me that quantum mechanics suggests a big hidden extra reality beyond and containing the known universe, but I&#039;ve actually been drawn increasingly in that direction in recent years regardless.  And yes, the basic quantum mechanics primer I mentioned above has reinforced that idea in me.  I like that concept, &quot;an open ended space of possible different rule sets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been developing a concept I&#039;ve been calling &quot;pesudo-existence&quot; to myself, though I imagine there&#039;s probably a name in metaphysics for it already, to denote things whose existence can never be directly verified either way, but which would make some theory or pattern or system more elegant or parsimonious if they did exist.  I could talk more about this if you wanted, but the topic is getting afield from your intelligence-focused blog.  Why is an elegant cosmological theory more likely to be correct than an inelegant one?  It seems to me that it requires there to be a larger structure in which to apply something like Occam&#039;s Razor.  If the universe just is the way it is, end of story, full stop, what does it matter whether the laws that govern it are elegant or not?  What would make one set of laws more likely than another, unless there were some higher system in place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say that anthropic arguments can be pretty unsatisfying.  I think the kind of argument you mean is: &quot;All the cosmoses that are mixed up so as to be super unstable can&#039;t support life, so of course we weren&#039;t born there, just like we were (of course) born on the surface of a planet and not in open space.  But there are a few that do support life, and in those cosmoses, maybe each one has just ONE planet with the perfect Goldilocks conditions, so here we are.&quot;  That may be a bleak outlook, but it can explain why we seem to (maybe) be alone.  I&#039;ve been drawn toward that point of view myself.  So, if I&#039;ve understood correctly what you mean, what&#039;s unsatisfying about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the idea of a universe having &quot;enough quantum observers in it to retroactively break that symmetry,&quot; that is finally too much for my poor brain to handle at my current level of education, and so here my comments will stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, time to try and be smart for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology is the context where most people become familiar with the concept of evolution, so it seems that the conditions of biological evolution (like mutations and recombination) are the default conditions for the concept at large. And when someone talks about, say, studying evolution, or believing in evolution, they almost always mean the biological concept. I think that makes sense because Darwin&#039;s blockbuster idea was the one that changed people&#039;s view of the world more than, say, any theory about the evolution of human languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, interesting that you&#039;ve already read about cosmological evolution (and much more than I have). Maybe I should read that Hawking book, but I&#039;m kind of intimidated by things like &quot;Why does time exist&quot; and &quot;what are the irregularities in time, space, and causality?&quot; I&#039;m reading a graphic non-fiction book called Totally Random, among my many other current books, which is a beginner&#039;s guide to quantum entanglement that may lay the groundwork for further learning for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your points on entropy are interesting! That all I can say about them for now, except that I guess the reason life concentrates order in some places, raising entropy to a higher degree elsewhere, is because, as with everything else about evolution, that&#039;s the strategy that works to make something stable. Gotta nom some structured energy, yum yum yum. Now there&#039;s more me-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&#039;ve seen implications that fire is alive because it satisfies all the basic criteria for life. On the one hand, it would be clearly erroneous to define life narrowly in terms of RNA and specific molecules, since that would exclude just about all alien life, no matter how similar to us it might appear, or for that matter a shadow biosphere. But it also doesn&#039;t seem satisfying to say that fire is alive. I don&#039;t have a clear way of delineating what should count as &#039;life&#039; from what shouldn&#039;t, but vaguely speaking, I&#039;ve come to think of it as that which perpetuates itself through &#039;cool tricks&#039; or &#039;cleverness&#039;. Like DNA using itself to build proteins that turn on and off pieces of DNA--level jumping that isn&#039;t the sort of thing you can work out algorithmically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ve said that some would argue the defining feature of life is that it draws energy and materials from the environment broadly in order to create order within itself. Does that solve the problem? Is fire excluded because it doesn&#039;t contain enough order? I guess so? I don&#039;t really understand entropy yet. But does this definition allow us to consider crystals as being alive? I don&#039;t feel like crystals are &#039;tricky&#039; enough that they should count. Whereas, viruses probably are.&lt;/p&gt;
