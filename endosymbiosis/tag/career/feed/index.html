<p>(Photo is a shot I took of downtown Burlington, VT at twilight with lights in the trees and a clock tower in the background)</p>



<p>A year and a half ago, I took a big risk by leaving my comfortable career in the tech industry to pursue a graduate degree. Like many people, recent events inspired me to find more meaningful work, but it&#8217;s an intimidating change. How do you even do that? I have ideas I want to pursue, but they&#8217;re not exactly mainstream, and grad school is competitive. I didn’t know where to start, but I decided to try. I pushed my way through, and I&#8217;m very happy with <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/04/06/back-to-school/">the results</a>. I don’t claim to have a secret recipe for career change, but I want to share my experience in case it’s helpful for you or someone you know.</p>



<p>My first challenge was realizing: I have no idea what grad school is even like. Most universities have two parallel programs: they provide a baseline education to the masses for a profit, and then they actually do science and train scientists. Generally speaking, the only thing these have in common is the college where they happen. I got my baseline undergraduate education at Brown, but that didn’t teach me anything about grad school. While I was on campus, I had the <em>opportunity</em> to learn about grad school, but I wasn’t interested then, so I let that chance pass me by.</p>



<p>Many years later, I tried to learn what grad school is and how to succeed there by talking to students and professors. This was surprisingly painful. In general, folks did a poor job explaining what grad school is like, and gave me all sorts of conflicting advice. Gradually, I began to see two big reasons why:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>. There’s no one “grad school experience.” Every school, discipline, program, and lab is different. They have their own jargon, priorities, and expectations. Yet, when asking someone about it, they will describe their experience as typical, and give specific advice that would have helped them. The best way to get a sense of what&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; is to talk to lots of folks and pay careful attention to where they <em>disagree</em>. Conflicting advice helped me understand the full range of programs out there.</li>



<li><strong>Immersion</strong>. Grad school is an immersive experience. I expect I’ll show up on campus, get swept up in things, and gradually discover I’m “being a grad student” without ever being taught how. This sort of experiential learning is fast and effective, but it’s hard to explain. People just don’t have the words. They shared lots of details, but without context those mostly went over my head. They didn&#8217;t mention the “obvious stuff,” because it&#8217;s intuitive for them, and I didn&#8217;t know to ask about it. To learn the fundamentals, I had to <em>read between the lines</em>. When something didn&#8217;t add up, I&#8217;d look for hidden assumptions that could explain the reasoning. Cross referencing multiple conversations was important.</li>
</ol>



<p>The next challenge was finding the right place for me. At a high level, academia is divided into disciplines, like Physics, Biology, or Computer Science, and each of those has many sub-disciplines nested within. Each one is working on a certain set of problems using certain tools and methods. Many grad students start with no clear idea of what they’ll do. They just pick a discipline, learn about it, and find a way to make themselves useful. My situation is different: I have specific ideas I want to pursue. Unfortunately, scientists aren’t very interested in cool ideas from outsiders, unless they happen to fit within their field of research.</p>



<p>It took me a long time to figure out what discipline to join. It seems like it should be obvious, but many research questions like mine are <em>interdisciplinary</em>, and don&#8217;t fit the usual options. Ultimately, it came down to what <em>tools</em> I wanted to use. Even though my ideas are about life, self-making, and meaning, I want to study these phenomena <em>as algorithms</em>, analyze their behavior, and recreate them in a computer. This led me to focus on Computer Science, and the sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. I’m ambitious and experienced, so naturally I thought I’d apply to the top schools for CS and AI. That was a mistake.</p>



<p>The problem is,the big-name schools are mainstream by definition, and my research is not. I’m actually quite concerned that the field has lost its way. They have too narrow a definition for “intelligence,” and tend to worry more about new consumer technology than understanding nature. But the big schools are the ones <em>setting</em> this agenda. Their programs are highly competitive, and they’re looking for people who will advance their goals. Even if I somehow managed to get in, they would not provide a supportive environment for me as a student.</p>



<p>If not the big name schools, then where? There are many options, covering an <em>enormous</em> range. How do I find the right one? The promotional materials online are quite generic and unhelpful, so again I turned to people. I cold emailed professors doing vaguely related work, and maybe one in five replied. At first, they barely understood what I was talking about or what to suggest, but usually they could point me at someone slightly more relevant than themselves. That way, I gradually worked my way to folks who “got it.” This led me to a totally new list of schools to apply to. It took nearly a full year, and I wish I had longer.</p>



<p>Figuring out where I fit in was also about looking inwards. I had ideas, but they were vague and complex. To talk to people, I had to explain myself in ways they could understand. That was hard, but useful. It forced me to consolidate my ideas, disentangle them, and look at them from many angles. I wrote it all down, which was important. Most professors don’t have time for extra reading, but the writing process helped me organize my thoughts, making them much easier to talk about. Some of that writing even ended up on this blog.</p>



<p>I also did a lot of reading, which was invaluable. I read books and journal articles covering a wide swath <em>around</em> my ideas in different fields. This let me survey the kinds of work people were actually doing, and imagine myself in their shoes. I was surprised by how many ideas excited me in theory, but sounded like a drag in practice. I also learned about the jargon, ideas, and thinkers in this space. That made it much easier to talk to professors, helped me find new leads, and gave me new tools for my research.</p>



<p>What are my big takeaways from all of this? Grad school is a bit of a catch-22. It’s a big, complex, and opaque institution. It’s hard to learn about it without being a part of it. It’s hard to get accepted or be successful without knowing the field, the professors, the incentive structures—in other words, being an insider already. Luckily, it’s possible to pick up this knowledge. It’s just a difficult and time-consuming process, and it helps to have connections. Most professors don’t have time for outsiders, but some are eager to help, <em>especially</em> for ideas near and dear to their hearts. Once I finally found folks who shared my interests, they welcomed me with open arms.</p>



<p>So that’s my journey, what I did, what I learned, and how it went. Now I’d love to hear from you. Does any of this surprise you, or resonate with your own experience? Do you have any questions about getting into higher education, or advice for others just getting started? Any thoughts on the state of academia generally? Join the conversation in the comments! It’s my favorite part of this blog, so don’t miss out.</p>
