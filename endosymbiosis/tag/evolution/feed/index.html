<p>Life has been steadily driving towards greater and greater intelligence, eventually leading to human beings, who are the very pinnacle of this trend. Our superior minds are what separate us from the animals. They empower us to make a world of human flourishing, and justify our dominion over the planet. These tropes about intelligence are so common in our culture, they almost sound self-evident. Yet, I&#8217;ll argue that they&#8217;re completely wrong. These ideas are enticing because they appeal to our pride and our sense of specialness, but this way of thinking is destroying our world. So, let’s break down these myths and talk about what intelligence is <em>not</em>.</p>



<p>One problem with this story is it presents intelligence as a linear thing. Life started out dumb, and it gradually got smarter and smarter. In a sense, this is true. More intelligent life is more complicated, so it takes longer to evolve. But life doesn’t evolve <em>towards</em> anything, it evolves in all directions, finding and filling every niche available. Monkeys are brilliant at navigating tree branches and spotting ripe fruit. Trees are brilliant at producing the right amount of fruit at the right moment to use local resources efficiently and maximize the spread of their seeds. Yeasts are brilliant at performing alchemy on that fruit, transmuting sugar into alcohol, which the monkeys love. These are all different kinds of intelligence, and none is “better” than the other because they’re all contextual and interdependent. Every instance of intelligence looks different, because it’s adapted to a unique lifestyle.</p>



<p>We live a very complicated lifestyle that depends on our big brains, so we tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case. Some of the simplest, dumbest organisms on Earth are also the most successful. Microbes, fungus, and plants make up something like 99.5% of Earth’s biomass, while animals (the “smart”ones) make up the rest. Being smart is metabolically expensive. Taking time to think can mean missing a moment of opportunity. Sometimes real intelligence is knowing when a mindless strategy works best. If anything, humans are a great example of how intelligence can backfire. We’ve used our intelligence to make civilization, which is amazing! But in doing so, we accidentally drove many species to extinction, exhausted resources we depend on, and destabilized the global climate. Our kind of big-brained intelligence is a high risk, high reward strategy.</p>



<p>This brings us to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of intelligence. The problem with a word like “pinnacle” is it suggests we are the <em>ultimate</em> form—the thing life’s been building up to, all this time. But we’re not the end of anything. We’re still evolving, and it’s unclear whether our intelligence will go up or down from here. We’re also not the only ones. There are a handful of species that have gone “all in” on the strategy of super intelligence. You know, elephants, dolphins, octopi, the usual suspects. Humans may, in fact, be the smartest of them all, but since intelligence is so contextual, it’s hard to say. Maybe dolphins are <em>more</em> intelligent than us, it just looks different in an ocean species with no hands?</p>



<p>It may seem obvious that human intelligence is something more and different from those other species. We invented the wheel, New York, wars and so on. But that really isn’t because we as individuals are so smart. This is made clear by the tragic case of “wild children,” who grow up without parents or any human community. In the few cases we’ve observed, these children were described as animalistic, violent, and cognitively impaired. They were never able to recover or integrate into human society. Our brains alone do <em>not</em> set us apart from animals. Our <em>society</em> does, and that’s a separate thing, that evolved <em>after</em> our big brains. We’re smarter than other animals not because of our biology, but because of the vast library of practical knowledge and resources that we share with one another.</p>



<p><em>That’s</em> what sets us apart: other species can’t access human culture. In a sense, that&#8217;s because those species are less intelligent; to fully appreciate human society, you need language and abstract thought, which many species lack completely. Yet some species <em>thrive</em> in human society anyway. By being useful (like wheat), or charismatic (like dogs), or sneaky (like raccoons) other species live with us and shape our human world. That’s because nature does not set humans apart from other animals. We set <em>ourselves</em> apart from other life by building walls, by excluding them from our world, to the extent that we can. We decide what plants and animals are pets, food, or pests. Other species don&#8217;t need language to live in human society if we choose to accommodate them. We can coexist with nature in community, as many human societies have, and still do. Or, we can perpetuate the myth that we are special to justify excluding and exploiting nature instead.</p>



<p>And, ultimately, that’s the problem with this notion of intelligence: we use it to draw a line between friend and resource. If smarter is better—if our <em>intelligence</em> is what sets us apart from other life, and gives us the right to exploit that life however we see fit—then where do we draw the line? Should smarter people get more rights and privileges than dumber ones? Is a disabled person no better than an animal? Should we simply recycle the feeble minded from our population? This line of thinking is revolting, and it only makes sense if you believe these myths about intelligence. Similarly, if anything less than human is just a dumb resource for us to exploit, why not pave the planet? What’s wrong with processing all of that biomass, every living thing on Earth, into fuel and plastics? I think intuitively we know why: life has a right to exist, and losing all those diverse and beautiful kinds of intelligence would be tragic.</p>



<p>I’m excited to live in a time when our understanding of intelligence is changing so rapidly. It’s hard to define the word, just because we have so many examples that pull in different directions, and seem to contradict one another. Intelligence is <em>many</em> things, and we’re still fleshing out the full picture. Yet, every day we see more clearly that our old conceptions of intelligence that put human beings on a pedestal were <em>wrong</em>, and, more importantly, that they are at the root of so much injustice and destruction. So, while these tropes are still everywhere around us, shape the way our world works, and may still <em>feel</em> intuitively true, I urge you to reject them. We must move on, and embrace a more expansive view, one that doesn’t start from the premise of who to exclude.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">(This month&#8217;s featured image is a <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/031/01G77PKB8NKR7S8Z6HBXMYATGJ">photo of the Carina Nebula</a> taken by NASA&#8217;s James Webb telescope. It&#8217;s a vast cloud of gas and dust, slowly condensing, with hundreds of stars visible in the background behind it. The colorized image almost looks like orange mountains with a blue mist rising from them, set on a black background with bright, six-sided starbursts.)</p>



<p>Normally, when we talk about evolution, we mean what life does. It’s Darwin’s magic formula. You need reproduction. You need to pass on a copy of your genes, with a little variation, so things don’t just stay the same. Natural selection will weed out the less fit individuals, so they have fewer kids. The more fit individuals become more prevalent and, over time, life as a whole evolves to be more fit. Yet, this isn’t a very satisfying story. For one thing, how did it begin? Did life just start evolving out of the blue? I think story is more compelling if we think about evolution a bit more abstractly. In a sense, the physical universe itself evolves. It doesn’t have reproduction and inheritance, but it sure does have variation and selection, and this has caused it to change dramatically over the course of history.</p>



<p>For the first 370,000 years or so, all of space was filled with a boring, homogeneous cloud of energy and plasma. That universe is now extinct, and for one simple reason: it was unstable. In our universe, stability is the ultimate definition of “fitness.” What persists, exists. Patterns of matter and energy that get generated more often and stick around longer become more prevalent. Those that are rare and fragile exist only fleetingly. The plasma universe is gone because gravity causes matter to clump together. It was like a pencil, balanced on its tip. As soon as it became just a little unbalanced, it rapidly fell farther and farther away from that delicate equilibrium. Plasma condensed into molecules, gas clouds, and stars.</p>



<p>Of course, evolution needs variation to work. To find what&#8217;s better, you need to weed out what&#8217;s worse. For life, reproduction is the engine of variation, but that isn’t necessary if you have unimaginably vast scale. The universe started out with very little variation, but it steadily increased as matter interacted with itself. Gravity caused hydrogen molecules to group together in uneven clumps, and held them there. They sat around for millions of years, slowly growing bigger, until the force of their own weight ignited a fusion reaction. The gas clouds became stars, and in their cores new elements were born. The universe’s population gradually became more diverse.</p>



<p>That’s the counterintuitive thing about stability: it can generate diversity. When patterns become more numerous, and they stick around for longer, chaos starts to kick in. Every star and every planet is a little different. They have unique histories and influences and opportunities. They might be richer in this element or that one, bigger or smaller, hotter or colder, more or less affected by collisions. This diversity only compounds over time, as these objects smash together and interact in complex ways. The longer they stick around, the more they change, recombine, and become more elaborate.</p>



<p>So, for 13 billion years, the universe evolved. Its population became stranger and more complicated. Today we have about a hundred “naturally occurring” elements that didn’t exist at first, but had to evolve through multiple generations of stars fusing atoms, exploding violently, and gradually reforming. We have many <em>kinds</em> of stars, planets, solar systems, and galaxies, that support an astonishing variety of chemical processes that have had a very, very long time to develop. They produce “primordial soups,” pocket environments full of useful molecules for life, a steady energy source, and self-perpetuating chemical reactions. We think this happened at least once to seed all life on Earth, but it may in fact be very common.</p>



<p>I think this story is an essential foundation for understanding evolution as life does it. Because life didn’t start this process. The universe provides energy and raw materials in vast amounts. It provides the chaos and entropy that drives seemingly random variation, and the slow, continual breaking down that causes natural selection to prefer stable, commonly made forms. The laws of physics cause the universe to evolve towards stability, diversity, and complexity, at least for a while, until it starts to wind down again and settle into entropy. Life merely <em>constrains</em> that process, making it more efficient and productive, for the simple reason that matter that does so becomes more prevalent.</p>



<p>In these primordial soups, some chemical systems evolved to enclose themselves in bubbles, protecting delicate reactions from the outside world. These self-made &#8220;individuals&#8221; evolved regular cycles of reproduction, explicitly making copies of themselves rather than waiting for the right reactants to come together again by chance. They evolved DNA to constrain these copies, and make them more precise reproductions of the original. They evolved sophisticated error checking, which made the copies more robust and reliable. But this also gave life the power to <em>manage</em> variation across generations, and thus shape its own evolution. Life evolved sex to further manage variation, accelerating innovation by sharing genetic recipes across lineages. Life evolved an <em>astonishing variety</em> of sexual and reproductive practices, allowing it to evolve in different ways, with different patterns of variation and selection, each suited to a different range of environments and lifestyles.</p>



<p>The physical Universe evolves—in the most primitive way imaginable, but it still produces stability and complexity in a <em>vast</em> number of diverse forms. It generates the seeds of life, without any guidance or direction. Life evolves differently, because it constrains this process, making it discrete, digital, and managed. This started very simply, just discovering chemical reactions that isolate and maintain themselves. But perhaps this is the origin of what we think of as “intelligence” or “agency”? Without noticing, matter became “opinionated,” preferring certain forms and acting explicitly to promote them. From there, life’s “opinions” about itself only became more demanding and elaborate.</p>



<p>We often present evolution as one simple story, but there are many ways to evolve. Evolution is more like a general principle than a specific algorithm. Even just life as we know it, all based on the DNA molecule, has invented an <em>astonishing</em> variety of different and complex ways of evolving. Bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals <em>use</em> DNA differently. They grow, behave, and reproduce in <em>completely</em> different ways. How many other ways might there be to do it? When we present evolution as a single, constant thing, we limit our imagination. Evolution evolves, and it takes as many diverse forms as it makes.</p>

<p>I’m at an interesting moment in my studies, so I thought I’d let you know what’s going on!</p>



<p>Year two of my PhD program has begun. I’m about a month into my third semester, and things are going well. I’m taking two classes right now: Evolutionary Computation, and Deep Learning. Most of my Computer Science education has been about how to design algorithms and write software to solve different kinds of problems, but these classes are different. This semester, I’m learning how to get computers to discover their own algorithms, and write their own software. Honestly, the state of the art here is still quite primitive. We’ve found some very impressive techniques, but they each apply to a narrow domain, and we don’t understand them nearly as well as we’d like. Which makes them fun topics to study. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The other fun thing about this semester is that both of my classes are built around student projects. More or less, I get to pick projects that fit with my research, and the class is there to help me find the time, resources, and guidance to complete the projects successfully. I like this much better than undergraduate style courses built around assignments and exams that are very generic and may not be relevant to my work. We’ll see how things unfold, but I’m currently planning to work on two projects that I’m excited about.</p>



<p>For Evolutionary Computation, I’m working on an experiment about endosymbiosis. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE">this classic experiment</a>, which examined how bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, and how genetic innovations spread through the population spatially. I’m going to try evolving a host environment that supports an inner population, a bit like how my gut supports a microbiome. The hope is that the host will be able to design a supportive environment, with different regions that cultivate “microbes” with different traits, such that it can guide and coax them into evolving more specialized forms. This is an exciting experiment for me, because I’m not sure what to expect, but I’m pretty confident that <em>something</em> interesting will happen.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdXXQwS7goi1ItbTdONUzbfEiFKBIKils0XIfkXZl1xwzGxuTrV76lD5OFiNLNtXdXMpPz_do1AW3qdFEFbe4loZzIcjVBTtC7ciQbwbYhN1TQMr3tf_AuT-skSA-X_9lOauzGL31dv3Lj7hQqRBu0stv8?key=F266DdYKyjrziMBoqIpF8A" alt="A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred."></p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred.</p>



<p>For Deep Learning, I’m going to use computer vision techniques to detect interesting patterns in the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/">Game of Life</a>, since I’ve been using that as an environment for my evolution experiments. The Game of Life has very simple rules, but it evolves in complex ways. Most patterns quickly dissolve into empty space or settle into a few boring, stable forms. But rarely, you get something much more interesting. For decades, people have been exploring this space, finding interesting patterns and classifying them. You get huge complex structures that stabilize themselves, change continuously in repeating cycles, or even propel themselves and move at a steady pace. I’ll build a system that can detect and categorize these patterns, so that when my evolutionary algorithm finds them, I can reward it and ask for “more like that.”</p>

<p>This month’s essay is inspired by my Evolutionary Computation class, and the work I’ve been doing to develop the specific research questions I want to focus on for my PhD. So, check back on Wednesday to learn more about how evolution got started, and why it’s worth asking: how does evolution evolve?</p>

<p>(I took this post’s photo at the Star Trek Original Series Set Tour in Ticonderoga, New York. It’s a view of the warp core of the USS Enterprise, which is only a few feet deep but looks much larger thanks to forced perspective. The room is filled with structures with complicated geometric shapes, technical looking panels, and dramatic lighting in red, blue, and purple.)</p>



<p>In my last post, I wrote about my latest research project and why I was so excited to present it at GECCO, the premier conference for evolutionary computation. I promised a follow-up, and here it is! Unfortunately, I didn’t make it to Melbourne. Instead, I had a very complicated and protracted battle with my University’s travel planning system, United Airlines, and the Australian visa office, all from the comfort of my home in Vermont. I couldn’t even participate in the event remotely, because of the time zone difference. This is all very disappointing, but I tried to make the best of it. I’ve been busy with the next iteration of this project, and enjoying a bit of “staycation” time here in New England (hence this month’s cover photo).</p>



<p>In any case, my paper <em>did</em> get published, and I’d still like to share the materials I presented virtually at the conference. It’s mostly intended for a technical audience, but I hope at least some of my readers will find it interesting. The paper is titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638530.3654259">A Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm for Co-evolving Genotypes and Genotype / Phenotype Maps</a>, and is available for free online. I had to cut it down to just four pages, since it was accepted as a poster, so I also wrote up an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype-results/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md">extended analysis of my results</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1/blob/main/README.md">hoverview of my algorithm&#8217;s implementation</a>,  for those who want to go deeper. There&#8217;s also a digital version of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3x58W46RPuXOkqY6NavS6ndpeaEgiZB/view?usp=drive_link">poster</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ej09sxSULmzwNd65EPQInTUySmsUtiq/view?usp=drive_link">short video</a> overview of my experiment.</p>



<p>I continue to work on this idea, and it is starting to evolve beyond what I presented in that paper. Right now, I’m actively deconstructing and rebuilding the algorithm. CPPNs are an important and well known part of the AI field, so I’m trying to describe precisely how my algorithm is different, and which of those differences account for the remarkable results I found. Originally I thought of this research as being about epigenetics specifically, but as I try to generalize and simplify, what I’m left with looks like straight-up endosymbiosis. I’ve been thinking of this algorithm as a metaphor for a cell and its genes / nucleus, but it could just as easily be a metaphor for an animal and its community of microbes. This is exciting, since I’d love to do more research on endosymbiosis, and I really like the idea that perhaps symbiosis is the driving force behind intelligence as we know it, fundamentally changing the dynamics of evolution.</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s how I see it for the moment, and where I hope my research will lead in the near future. For now, though, I’m wrapping up my summer with a few more fun outings, and preparing for the start of classes later this month. I’ll be diving deep into both evolutionary computation and deep learning, which I’m really looking forward to.</p>

It grows in a branching network of banana-yellow tendrils, some of which are engulfing plant debris they encountered. <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/slime-molds-capable-passing-learned-behaviors-new-cell-populations/">Source</a>)</p>



<p>Later this month, I’ll be attending the <a href="https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/HomePage">Genetic and Evolutionary Computing Conference</a> (GECCO) in Melbourne, Australia. I’m super excited to go, and to present my very first published academic paper as a poster. I’ll share more here when all is said and done, but unfortunately my paper isn’t really intended for a general audience, like this blog. It would probably be hard to understand for anyone outside of the fields of AI or ALife. So, for everybody else, I’d like to share what the paper means to me, and what I’m trying to say by publishing it.</p>



<p>My research is inspired by epigenetics, and new ways of thinking about evolution. I saw that life doesn’t just evolve by chance, it evolves to become more evolvable. It learns how to explore the range of possible forms and lifestyles more efficiently, and to nudge evolution down more fruitful paths. Life uses its intelligence to become more intelligent still. In my mind, this changes <em>everything</em> about evolution, and I was shocked it wasn’t more well known. Most discussions of evolution (and the programmer version: evolutionary computation, or EC) are too simple, and ignore these critical details. So, I figured I’d be the one to bring this up, and show people why it matters.</p>



<p>I started my first experiment before I even got to university. I was so excited by the idea, I just had to get it out of my head. I actually avoided looking for prior work, because I wanted to see how <em>I</em> would manifest this idea without being biased by other people’s thinking. Besides, I didn’t know of any research like mine, and I didn’t know how to find it, either. That’s why I applied to UVM. When I got here, my advisor and lab mates encouraged me to publish this project, and pointed me at the relevant literature. So I hit the books, reading all that had been done before in order to put my own work into context.</p>



<p>And, of course, I found I’m not the first to have this idea. There are many variations of EC inspired by biology, looking for the “secret sauce” that makes life more powerful than our computer models. In particular, how life evolves to be more evolvable is an active area of research, which has been building momentum in recent years. At first, I was disappointed. My idea was already taken! So much of what I thought made my project interesting had been tried before in some other context. But not exactly. Identifying those subtle differences has been tremendously helpful.</p>



<p>You see, it’s pretty well established now that “evolvability” is important. In our experiments, simulated life that’s more evolvable finds fitter solutions faster. It’s better at adapting to changing circumstances, too. It seems to be smarter and more creative. I find this exhilarating, yet these discoveries didn’t “change everything” like I had hoped. In the experiments so far, it feels like an incremental improvement. It helps, but not enough to draw much attention away from other areas of AI research, like deep learning, which is seen as much more powerful and more productive.</p>



<p>I think that’s because we still haven’t broken out of our old ways of thinking. Traditional EC is all about finding good solutions to a problem, but I would argue that evolution isn’t about problem solving. It’s about problem <em>finding</em>. Life explores the space of possible lifestyles to find and exploit <em>opportunities</em>. The evolution of life is a bit like a slime mold. It grows simultaneously in all directions, questing around obstacles to find resources, reinforcing the branches that get lucky, culling back the ones that don’t. It doesn’t have a top-down view of the world, but it’s still <em>strategic</em> and <em>adaptive</em>. When I look at most of the existing experiments in this space, I feel like we’re putting a slime mold into a narrow tunnel and measuring how fast it can get to the other end. We’re accidentally putting evolution in a straight jacket, and blinding ourselves to what makes it so interesting and powerful.</p>



<p>So, in my first experiment, I try to show a different perspective. I made a single algorithm that can adapt itself to solve many <em>different</em> tasks. Normally, an EC programmer picks one task to solve, then designs an evolutionary search strategy to suit that problem. They invent a genome language, a way of turning that into a solution, and ways of randomly tweaking the genome that might lead to better solutions. In my experiment, I evolved the search strategy, too. As the programmer, I designed a vast and open ended search domain, and many ways that the algorithm could restrict that space. But I wasn’t sure which restricted sub-spaces would work best, and, unlike traditional EC, I didn’t try to guess. I just let the algorithm figure that out for itself.</p>



<p>The way I did this is also interesting. It turns out, the algorithm I invented is strikingly similar to one that’s already popular: “compositional pattern-producing networks,” or CPPNs. Again, it was a little frustrating to be scooped, but I’m using this algorithm in a new way. Instead of evolving new “bodies” for simulated life, I’m evolving new <em>ways of generating</em> bodies. It’s a subtle difference, but an important one, I think. That extra level of indirection gives evolution more influence over its destiny, and the power to make more complex patterns in ways I couldn’t even anticipate. Now that I know how my idea is so similar to, yet different from, an existing algorithm, I’m teasing apart those differences, to measure the impact of each one.</p>



<p>I’m proud of my work, and excited to talk about it with other EC enthusiasts at GECCO. On the other hand, I’m still figuring out how to do science, and there’s a lot I <em>don’t</em> like about my first paper. This project was mostly my way of proving to myself that this crazy idea could work. The results are intriguing, but it’s not yet a clear example of what I want to show. It’s also complicated, unusual, and hard to explain, even to other EC researchers. If I want people to get excited about this, I need to simplify, make my work more relatable, and find better ways to demonstrate and measure the novel behavior I’m talking about here. There are no “obstacle courses for slime molds” in the EC literature that I know of, so perhaps I’ll need to design some.</p>



<p>Hopefully, I’ll get lots of inspiration and feedback at GECCO. As I learn more about the field of EC, I’m finding more and more examples of work similar, yet slightly different, from my own. This is great, because each of those differences is an opportunity for a new experiment, to see if my perspective can shed light on something new. I’m already dreaming up all sorts of new ways to explore my ideas. And that’s more or less how I hope to spend the next several years. Maybe <em>that’s</em> my PhD.</p>



<p>In any case, I hope that explanation was interesting, and not too vague. I’ll get more specific in a few weeks, when I post a follow up with the full GECCO paper, the poster I presented, a video summary of that poster, and links to some supplemental results and analysis. I bet I’ll have some fun things to report from my time in Melbourne, too! As always, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>I just published a new coding project! If you&#8217;ve been following along, this is the &#8220;grown up&#8221; version of a <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/i-built-a-thing/">demo project</a> I posted last year.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s further exploration of what I call an “epigenetic algorithm.” It’s inspired by a simple observation: in living cells, the process of evolution is actively managed by the cell, which itself is an evolved mechanism. Using evolution to optimize evolution seems like a powerful trick, so I’m trying to reproduce it in small-scale AI experiments. I hope to make evolutionary computing more open-ended, more successful in vast search spaces, and less biased by the programmer. In this case, I’m generating cool looking Game of Life simulations, but I hope to find many more practical applications in the future.</p>



<p>I’m not sure whether or not I will publish this as a work of science. It’s complicated and weird and there’s more work involved to make this a proper controlled experiment. As I learn more, I’m already thinking of other ways to explore this idea that might be more effective. So, for now, the plan is just to share the code and I may or may not revisit this later, depending on where my other leads take me.&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I gave a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZIYj8Rg4xPHukQ-Glk9_IZTgimEYh5dtWsyXrbkX9Dc/edit?usp=sharing">presentation</a> that covers the motivation, results, and challenges of this project for a technical audience.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 3</h1>



<p>(The image for this week is an illustration from Waddington&#8217;s 1957 paper <em>The Strategy of the Genes</em>, which is often used to explain canalization. It shows a landscape with shallow, forking grooves and a ball rolling down that landscape. Although the ball&#8217;s path isn&#8217;t fully determined, the existing impressions in the landscape constrain it to one of a few likely paths)</p>



<p>This is part three of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">the beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Darwin explained part of the great mystery of life: how complexity and intelligence can evolve from randomness. When DNA was discovered, this seemed to “seal the deal.” DNA is the molecule that describes an organism’s nature, makes traits heritable, and carries mutations that are fodder for natural selection. That seemed to explain everything, at first, but I would argue that’s just the beginning. The DNA molecule itself lies at the heart of an incredibly complex system of processes that manage its care, use, and replication. These systems are collectively studied as “epigenetics,” and science is just beginning to understand how they work and the impact they have on evolution.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that DNA is an inert molecule that does nothing by itself. It needs a cell, a sort of organic micro-robot, to interpret that DNA and turn it into form and behavior. So, in a sense, every living thing is made up of <em>two</em> evolved programs: the DNA and the cell. Both are made of physical matter, which are subject to mutations. Both share the same selective pressures and reproductive fate. They evolve together, but they have different purposes. For the most part, the DNA program is what determines the organism’s lifestyle. The cell decides how to read that program, and how to make changes to that program over a lifetime and across generations.</p>



<p>One of the most important ways cells influence their own programming is through mutations. These happen naturally. As molecules bang against each other and get exposed to UV radiation from the sun, they sometimes spontaneously change shape. When those molecules represent critical information for a species’ survival, that could be disastrous. For this reason, life invests a <em>ton</em> of energy into detecting and correcting errors. But this process is never perfect, and it can’t be. If life always copied itself <em>perfectly</em>, there would be no variation for selection to act on, and no evolution. Not only that, getting the error rate much lower than it already is would be prohibitively expensive. So, life strikes a healthy balance, allowing just enough mutation to be useful, but not enough to be dangerous.</p>



<p>Interestingly, that finely-tuned mutation rate is not constant and universal. There are some stretches of DNA that get <em>extra</em> error correction, always triple checked to ensure they stay as stable as possible. On the other hand, some stretches of DNA get actively shuffled, injecting randomness into things like the immune system, creating diversity that makes the population as a whole more robust. Perhaps most remarkable is that when cells get stressed out, they divert energy to other things, and away from error correction. This may just be an accidental side effect of the cell breaking down, but it might also be a survival strategy. To anthropomorphize, perhaps cells get creative when times are tough, trying out crazy ideas in the desperate hope that one might save them.</p>



<p>That said, a single DNA copying error can be <em>devastating</em>, so how does life cope? Remarkably, it can often just work around the problem. Living systems have a lot of redundancy, with many mutually supportive ways of doing basically the same thing. This leads to a phenomenon called “canalization.” The more critical some behavior is to life, and the longer it persists over many generations, the more redundancy builds up around it. This means that single errors may alter the behavior a little, change how it works, or make it less efficient, but probably won’t break it entirely.</p>



<p>When errors are too severe to recover from, an organism might just fail to thrive and die, but sometimes it actually notices the failure and decides to self-terminate. That may seem bizarre, but in multicellular organisms it makes a lot of sense. If the error is in a single cell, then removing that cell lets others take over its job. If the error would prevent the whole embryo from developing into a healthy adult, then it’s better to scrap the work in progress, recycle those materials, and start over from scratch. In other words, life has its own Quality Assurance processes, at multiple levels, which minimize investment into evolutionary dead ends.</p>



<p>Cells can also swap genes with each other, sharing useful recipes and trying them out in new combinations. Sex is one way to do it, aligning and remixing two complete genomes in an incredibly complex way that ensures the resulting DNA program is still valid. Simpler organisms like bacteria don’t do this, but swap genes in a much more free-form process called “horizontal gene transfer.” Basically, cells sometimes leave scraps of DNA lying around, or pick up those scraps and integrate them into their own programming. This can let a new behavior (like resisting some toxin or eating some food) spread very rapidly through a bacterial colony. Either way, randomly adopting genes <em>that have proven successful in another organism</em> is a much safer and more powerful way to create useful diversity than mutation alone.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that how a cell reads its DNA can change over a lifetime. Cells annotate their program with notes (ie, methylation) that indicate which recipes to avoid or use more of, depending on context. This is how single celled organisms adapt their behavior to a changing environment, and how cells in multicellular organisms differentiate into different kinds of tissues. Importantly, these notes are sometimes passed down across generations. For instance, an organism might survive near starvation by tuning down its metabolism, staying smaller, slower, and using less energy. That change is <em>heritable</em>. The next few generations will <em>also</em> have a slower metabolism, and if that serves them well, it could lead to long-lasting behavioral changes that eventually get encoded into the DNA itself.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve talked about how life modifies itself, but it also modifies the environment. Organisms can build caches, nests, and tools that make life easier, and these get passed on, too, both as hand-me-downs and as lessons. Organisms form an ecosystem, full of mutualistic relationships between species that make life easier. Over geological time, this has transformed our planet from a barren rock to a lush world full of possibility. Life cultivates a supportive environment for future generations, shaping their behavior and evolutionary fitness. Child care might be the most visible example, protecting each new life when it’s most fragile, then sending off the new generation in a good direction informed by the parent’s life experience.</p>



<p>In the basic Darwinian story, evolution is something that <em>happens to</em> organisms. Accidental changes occur randomly, and nature chooses which ones will persist. But as we’ve just seen, life does <em>not</em> leave things up to chance. Randomness plays a key role in biological evolution, but life manages that randomness carefully and uses it selectively. Life also does everything in its power to influence the next generation, in ways that are <em>not</em> random, but “purposeful” in a sense. A cell can’t understand <em>why</em> it does these things, but it does them for a reason: they worked well in the past, got selected for, and ended up in the cell’s programming.</p>



<p>This leads to a powerful realization: when it comes to influencing evolution, cells don’t understand what they’re doing, but many higher organisms <em>do</em>, at least a little. For instance, an animal can apply its full cognitive capacity, mind and all, to choosing a mate and raising its offspring. In this way, the cell has moved from blindly repeating what worked in the past, to making evolutionarily relevant decisions <em>intentionally</em>, with forethought and analysis. A dog may not understand genetics or think about the future of her species, but she <em>certainly</em> has strong opinions about who would make a good mate, when / where / how to raise her puppies, and which pups to give more or less attention to. She uses her senses, her instincts, and her big brain to make big decisions that shape evolution. She may not see the big picture, but she cares and makes informed choices nonetheless.</p>



<p>This helps explain the paradox of how life managed to become <em>so incredibly smart</em> just by randomly banging molecules together for a few billion years. Life may have started off randomly, but it quickly became more directed. <strong>Life </strong><strong><em>harnessed</em></strong><strong> Darwinian evolution to build a more powerful evolutionary algorithm, one that’s </strong><strong><em>opinionated</em></strong><strong> and shapes its own search space.</strong> At first, these evolution-shaping behaviors were simple and rigid, just tricks repeated by rote because they tended to make the next generation more successful. Then, as life became more intelligent, it started to apply that intelligence to shaping itself, creating a runaway process of recursive self-improvement.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The main takeaway from all this is that Darwin is the <em>beginning</em> of the story of evolution, not the end. Life uses all of its intelligent capacity to influence its own evolution. This led to a virtuous cycle. Increased intelligence gave life greater influence over evolution, which it used to become more intelligent, which gave it greater influence over evolution. For this reason, I think <strong>it’s better to say that life designed itself than to say it evolved by chance</strong>. The process of “design” here was more stochastic, collective, and unthinking than we normally associate with that word, but in the end, the result is the same.</p>



<p>This story is still uncertain. The science around autonomous robots, intelligent collectives, and epigenetics is relatively new, and changing all the time. Plenty of biologists push back hard against the idea of any sort of agency or direction in evolution, partly because they’ve been fighting against the theory of Intelligent Design for so long. Others believe we’re overdue for a <a href="https://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com/about-the-ees/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20extended%20evolutionary,i.e.%2C%20the%20modern%20synthesis).">new story about evolution</a>, and are trying to find the right narrative and the evidence to back it up. I hope my research into evolutionary algorithms might be a useful contribution to that effort. If you’d like to dig deeper into this topic, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526346279">Evolution in Four Dimensions</a> is an excellent overview of the field of epigenetics.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 2</h3>



<p>(this month&#8217;s image is a photo I took at Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, California. It consists of millions of tiny pebbles of polished sea glass in myriad colors. Each one is improbable to find at a beach, but all of them collectively tell the story of a larger-scale process that explains their presence—many years of disposing of waste bottles nearby)</p>



<p>This is part two of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Every living cell is a universal automaton, capable of an infinite variety of forms and lifestyles. The cell itself determines the range of possibility—what proteins can it make, how will they integrate into the whole, and how will they shape the organism’s life? But within that space of possibility, the gene sequence is the program that determines what <em>specific</em> body to make, and how it should respond to a chaotic environment. That program is of the utmost importance, selecting one specialized lifestyle out of infinitely many possibilities, most of which would never work. But who wrote it?</p>



<p>Life did. Or, in other words, <em>cells</em> wrote the programming for cells, but it doesn’t seem fair to call them “programmers.” A human programmer is a top-down problem solver. To modify some working software, I start by analyzing that system’s performance: what does it do, and how well? I then try to understand how the system works. I read its programming, and consider how that leads to the behavior I observe. I consider how the system might be better, what specific improvements I might make, and what consequences I expect. I design a change to the code, then tinker with it in a sandbox environment until it does exactly what I want with no surprises or side effects. Only when I’m satisfied do I push the code out for use in the real world.</p>



<p>How are cells supposed to do that? They don’t have a mind like I do. They monitor their own health and situation, but they can’t imagine themselves “from the outside.” They don’t understand their lifestyle, their goals, or their relationships with the world except in terms of stimulus and response. They can execute short stretches of programming from their DNA, but they can’t examine the program as a whole, or imagine what would happen if they ran some other program instead. Mutations and cross-breeding cause the program to change, but cells can’t verify those changes in a safe testing environment. They can only make a new organism, release it into the world, and hope for the best.</p>



<p>This seems like a paradox, but only from the perspective of an individual cell. Life <em>never</em> exists as a lone individual. It always consists of diverse communities and ecosystems. So let’s take that perspective. Life isn’t a cell. Life is a <em>vast</em> collection of cells, an unimaginably huge number of concurrent individuals, living and dying continuously over billions of years. I like to think of it as a massively parallel computer. Life learns by accumulating and generalizing over the experiences of many lifetimes. It tries out many lifestyles simultaneously; whole different categories of lifestyles in different species and niches; many variations on a theme, among organisms of the same species. Whether any individual will be successful is hard to predict, because luck is such a huge factor. But by running the same experiments thousands of trillions of times over, life can get a relatively clear picture of what works and what doesn’t.</p>



<p>From this massively parallel perspective, each cell is a processor unit with two jobs. The first job is to live and reproduce. We normally think of that as “the purpose” of life, but from the collective perspective, it’s just the engine that keeps the system as a whole running. Individual lifetimes come and go rapidly and continuously like the cycles in a computer processor. The <em>second</em> job of each cell is <strong>to learn about the Universe and how to thrive in it, then integrate that information back into the system’s programming. That is life’s deeper purpose</strong>. Each cell has a very limited perspective and can only do this in a minimal way. But taken all together, vast numbers of cells can behave much more like a traditional programmer.</p>



<p>A cell has no understanding of what it does or how it fits into the big picture, but, in a sense, life as a whole <em>does</em>. Life consists of every cell, every lifestyle, every program that has worked so far, and all the dead ends that <em>aren’t</em> represented. That’s a tremendous amount of information about what the system does, which parts are performing better than others, and where there’s untapped potential. There’s no top-down designer, but this information, embodied in the population itself, still shapes the system’s evolution. Each cell acts selfishly, but by competing and collaborating with each other, life distributes resources to the parts of itself that are thriving in their niche, and encourages exploration of new lifestyles where opportunity lies.</p>



<p>The big difference between life and a human programmer is speculation. Humans <em>envision</em> the system as a whole and <em>imagine</em> where it might go. When I program a computer, I test ideas first in my mind and then in a virtual environment on the computer in order to avoid mistakes and dead ends. Life doesn’t do that, because its massively parallel, distributed design makes that impossible. There simply is no top-down view, no central authority to perceive and decide, no way to step out of the system for testing. Instead, life just tries everything. It tests code in production. It walks straight into failure rather than avoiding it. <strong>Death sorts what works from what doesn’t. That’s why we usually think of cells as “dumb” and humans as “smart.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>It would be better to think of humans as more efficient</strong>, because in a sense what we do isn’t so different. We both generate lots of options, test them, winnow them down to the most successful, and iterate. I do it with simulations in my brain, life does it with matter in the physical Universe. From a computational perspective, that doesn’t matter. A computer can be realized with cogs, transistors, neurons, or a simulation inside another computer. The materials can be anything so long as the <em>functionality</em> is the same. As individual living animals, it seems tragic and absurd that life must test out ideas by letting things die on a massive scale. From life’s perspective, though, a single lifetime is just a brief use of materials and programming that will get recycled for future experiments. If it were conscious, life as a collective whole wouldn’t regret (or notice!) the death of an organism any more than we regret the death of one of our cells.</p>



<p>You might argue that the human programmer also has <em>foresight</em>. I don’t just try stuff at random, I have a sense of what might work and what probably won’t. I use trial and error, but I <em>prioritize</em> and focus my exploration. It’s tempting to say cells <em>don’t</em> do this, but that’s too dismissive. Cells are quite opinionated. DNA doesn’t contain a blueprint for an organism, but a bunch of recipes that the cell can choose between depending on context. Cells must decide how to act. Evolution has equipped them with a wide variety of strategies and tools, and guidance on when to use them, all encoded in the DNA. This is how life learns from experience, plans ahead, and avoids dead ends. Life explores new paths at random, but it mostly tries out reasonable variations of known working strategies.</p>



<p>Individual cells aren’t much like human programmers, but they do have one thing in common: they write code. Mostly, the cell just copies its own DNA (copy / paste is a popular strategy among human programmers, too), but it makes an important decision: what variations to try in the next generation. This happens either through mutations, or by swapping genetic material with other cells. Without a top-down view of the gene sequence, this can only be a random process. The cell has no idea what changes it’s introducing, or what the consequences might be, but it <em>can</em> try to shape that randomness for the better. Primarily, this means spending a <em>ton</em> of time and energy on error correction, so that only a small number of mutations get through. It also shows up in things like mate selection, genetic recombination, and preparing the environment for the next generation.</p>



<p>I like to think of Darwin’s story as how life got started. Random mutation and selection are all you need to evolve better forms. As we learn more about cells, though, we see there’s a lot more going on. Life didn’t just find better lifestyles, it invented a general purpose platform capable of an infinite variety of lifestyles. As a collective, life uses that platform to explore many lifestyles simultaneously, pruning dead ends and investing more resources into exploring evolutionary paths that seem fruitful. Life started out randomly, but it grew more opinionated over time, and it has evolved many sophisticated ways to direct and shape its own evolution. That will be the topic of my next post.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell&#8217;s Eye View of Evolution, Part 1</h3>



<p>(This month&#8217;s image is a photo I took of the full-scale model of Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine at the Mountain View Computer History Museum. This is one of the first examples of a programmable digital computer. It&#8217;s a completely mechanical device, operated by hand crank.)</p>



<p>This is part one of a three-part series. For an overview, check out the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">introduction</a>.</p>



<p>In the traditional story of evolution, each organism lives a single lifestyle, and the forces of nature select which ones are fit enough to reproduce. From that perspective, evolution is something that <em>happens to</em> life. But this story fails to explain something very strange and important: cells are not single-purpose machines. Although they only live one lifestyle at a time, they have the capacity to live an infinite variety of lifestyles, depending on their DNA programming. That requires an enormous amount of complexity and effort that <em>doesn’t</em> directly contribute to a life well lived. In fact, being programmable doesn’t help <em>at all</em> in a single lifetime if the program never changes. So why does life work this way?</p>



<p>To make sense of this, let&#8217;s look at a parallel example in computer technology. Consider an ATM. It’s a highly specialized kind of machine, but these days if you look under the hood you’ll often find a Windows PC that’s <em>programmed to be</em> an ATM. That seems like an odd choice at first. ATMs do things most PCs <em>don’t</em> (like dispensing cash), and Windows supports things that you <em>don’t want</em> in an ATM (like running random programs off the internet). You could make a better, safer, more efficient ATM if you designed a custom machine for that purpose, but nobody does that, because it’s harder. Digital computers are so versatile and easy to reprogram that they show up <em>everywhere</em>. As they get used in new applications, their range of capabilities <em>expands</em>, enabling new use cases and further innovation.</p>



<p>Cells are very similar. Being programmable doesn’t help with any one lifestyle, but it makes it possible to explore new lifestyles relatively quickly and easily. Each individual operates in a complex, roundabout way that only uses a fraction of the cell’s potential. That seems like a bad thing, but the adaptability makes it worthwhile. The world is in constant flux, especially once organisms started actively changing things and competing with one another. Very few evolved lifestyles withstand the test of time. For this reason, nature doesn&#8217;t just select &#8220;the best lifestyles&#8221; for life. <strong>Life invested in a general purpose platform to make the search for new lifestyles more efficient</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at how the platform works. A cell can be thought of as a kind of microscopic robot. The “programming” for that robot is stored in DNA, which is surrounded by a complex mechanism that reads that data and uses it to produce the form and behavior of the organism. Each cell has a very limited capacity for intelligence, but they’re very good at working together. Like a sort of “autonomous smart matter,” they collaborate by the trillions, which is how every form of intelligence on this planet is made. There’s no reason to think there’s an upper limit to what can be built in this way.</p>



<p>What makes this possible is the protein-synthesis engine at the core of every cell. The nucleus of a cell is a bit like the brain of a human, in that it’s a specialized sort of computer that’s “in control” of the cell. It’s surrounded by the cell’s body, which serves as the interface between the program in its nucleus and the outside world. This is where the similarity ends, though, because the nucleus and the brain are very different kinds of computing devices.</p>



<p>The nucleus works by continuously handling requests, looking up protein recipes, and sending those recipes back out to the cell for construction. A cell can make an <em>astonishing</em> variety of complex molecules this way. These proteins are what make up the cell, its inner workings, and outward behaviors. They serve as building material, messages, tools, or even nano-robots that move about within the cell, manipulating other molecules, and doing useful work all on their own. Sometimes a single protein can serve <em>all</em> of these roles, depending on context. They interact with each other in a vast complex network of activity that keeps the cell alive.</p>



<p>These cellular mechanisms continuously send messages <em>back</em> to the nucleus, reporting on the cell’s health, situation, and needs. The nucleus uses this information to figure out what proteins to make next, adapting the cell’s makeup and behavior to fit the circumstances. For instance, <em>E. coli</em> bacteria normally feed on glucose sugar, but they can eat lactose instead, if that’s what’s available. When that happens, the cell reports to the nucleus that it’s running low on energy and what molecules are around. The nucleus then decides to switch some genes on and off, which instructs the cell to make different enzymes, which results in different cascades of chemical reactions, in order to digest and use the lactose. By reading the DNA differently, the nucleus shifts the whole cell from one lifestyle to another, in response to a changing environment.</p>



<p>Another way to think of the nucleus is as the <em>engine</em> of the cell. The proteins it makes drive all the chemical reactions that keep the cell alive. Ultimately, everything the cell does is about collecting the energy and raw materials to feed that engine and keep it running. This is the cell’s metabolism. When the engine runs faster, the organism becomes more active, moving, “thinking,” and reacting with speed and vigor, but quickly burning through its energy stores. When it runs slowly, the cell becomes sluggish and conserves its energy. If it ever comes to a full stop, the cell dies, or, in special cases, enters suspended animation. In other words: cells live to make proteins, and making proteins is what makes cells alive.</p>



<p>DNA is where the cell keeps all these protein recipes, but the DNA molecule itself is completely inert. It just carries information, like a computer memory card. It can’t do anything by itself, and certainly can’t make a <em>body</em> from scratch. <strong>To build an organism, you need a cell to interpret the gene sequence and do the construction</strong>. This is why cells always reproduce by splitting in two. The daughter cell is basically just half of the parent cell, full of the same soup of proteins and organelles, in a fully operational state. The only part that’s really “new” are the DNA molecules in the nucleus, freshly copied from the parent(s). Any changes in that DNA program will only manifest when the daughter cell sends a message to the nucleus and gets a different response back than its parent would have seen.</p>



<p>That means that every cell has the crucial responsibility of reading and writing those DNA programs. They contain every useful protein recipe life has discovered, and must be actively maintained over generations or those recipes will be lost. But what does life actually record in the DNA? Geneticists say DNA is made of four amino acid base pairs (A, G, T, C), which are grouped into triplets called “codons” that serve as instructions for protein synthesis. That makes it seem “natural,” as if that were the only way to do it. The truth is, the code is totally arbitrary. Life made it up. By trial and error, life invented a coding scheme. It gave meaning to those molecules and all the ways they can be combined. <strong>The programming language of life was invented by life. It wasn’t the beginning, but a tool that cells <em>made</em> to manage their behaviors, learn new ones, and pass knowledge to future generations</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s put that all together. A cell is a programmable micro-robot (in technical jargon, a “universal automaton”), capable of making virtually any protein and living virtually any lifestyle. In a sense, a cell is not just one organism, but potentially an infinite variety of organisms, depending on the programming in its nucleus. But how does the program get written? Life had to do all the work itself, without a programmer in the traditional sense. A cell has no mind with which to analyze its DNA and understand what it means. It cannot imagine the consequences of any changes to its programming, or test them out to make sure they are safe. And yet, somehow life invented a programming language and used it to write countless programs and build the full diversity of organisms we see on Earth.</p>



<p>We’ll delve into the details of how this happened in the next two blog posts. At a high level, though, there are two main parts of the story:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Life is self-made.</strong> Each cell is relatively simple and mindless, but working together in huge populations over long stretches of time, they develop their own programming. How they do it is quite different from how a human programmer would, but from a collective perspective, there are also some surprising similarities.</li>



<li><strong>Life influences future generations.</strong> Organisms don’t just worry about their own survival, they put an <em>enormous</em> amount of time and energy into influencing the next generation for the better. Science is only beginning to understand this, but it offers the tantalizing possibility that, in some limited sense, life might steer its own evolution.</li>
</ul>



<p>More on that next month.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>I’m trying something a little different. Over the next few months, I will publish a three-part series about evolution from some (hopefully) new perspectives. This represents how I, personally, have come to think about evolution. I’ll go beyond the scientific consensus to talk about some ideas that are uncommon and controversial. I believe I have a compelling story that’s consistent with established science, but this isn’t authoritative yet. In fact, I’m being a little bold and spicy in the hope of attracting criticism and feedback. I hope these ideas will frame my PhD research, so I’m excited to learn what people find interesting, useful, confusing, or problematic.</p>



<p>I’m doing this because I believe the way we usually talk about evolution obscures what&#8217;s really going on. In the “survival of the fittest” story, an individual organism lives its life, making choices that either help it thrive and reproduce, or not. If it’s successful, it will attract mates and have many children who are like them, but a little different, perhaps better. To follow the path of evolution, we then pick a new individual, maybe one of that organism’s children with a beneficial mutation, and see where life goes from there.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s an oversimplification of Darwin’s theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. It lacks nuance, but it’s basically correct and useful. The problem is, it’s just one way of looking at the situation, shaped by human bias. Each person is a multicellular individual that lives a long time and reproduces sexually, so it’s natural that we look at evolution from that perspective. But when it comes to life on Earth, we are the exception. The vast majority of life comes in colonies of single-celled organisms, living short lives and reproducing asexually. From that perspective, the process of evolution looks very different.</p>



<p>The next three blog posts will explore that perspective. <strong>Part one</strong> describes the cell as a tiny robot that uses DNA to program its own behavior. This will illustrate what it means to evolve such a program, and what purpose the program serves. <strong>Part two</strong> shifts perspective from a single cell to a population of cells over time. This illustrates how when individual cells work together in large numbers, they program themselves, using an evolutionary algorithm much more powerful than mere random variation and selection. Finally, <strong>part three</strong> discusses the complex ways that life influences the design of its own programming, and effectively “steers” its evolution, in a blind sort of way.</p>



<p>The first post goes out today, and you can read it <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/universal-automata/">here</a>. I’ll release the other two installments in September and November. Each post is written to stand on its own, but together they tell a more powerful story, so I hope you’ll come back for more!</p>
