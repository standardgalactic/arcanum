										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most people identify their intelligence with their conscious mind. That’s the part that <em>knows</em> it’s intelligent. That’s the part that understands and makes decisions. But looking closely, there’s plenty of intelligent things we do below the conscious level. Perhaps the most striking example is movement. We use our bones and muscles continuously during our waking hours. We learn complex motor skills and perform them over and over again with great precision and reliability. Yet, we rarely think about <em>how</em> we do those things. It’s actually an under-appreciated superpower that helps us multitask, overcome injuries, and adapt to new opportunities over evolutionary time. How does that work, and what does it teach us about intelligence?</p>



<p>The human body is a large and complex machine. Over 200 bones give our bodies shape, support their bulk, and articulate through 400 joints. Over 600 muscles hold those bones together, move them relative to each other, and maintain position and posture. Unlike a building with a rigid, static structure, the body is like a floppy ragdoll. It can only hold a shape through the constant effort of its muscles. Imagine a team of circus workers, lifting a long tent pole by ropes tied to the top. They work together to overcome gravity, hoisting the heavy thing and keeping it in a precarious upright position. They carefully balance the forces from all directions, adjusting how hard they pull to keep the pole vertical, even compensating for the wind if necessary. Now imagine another tent pole balanced on top of that one. Then another, and another… it’s pretty amazing that the body can perform this feat at all.</p>



<p>And that’s just for standing still. Actually moving the body in useful ways is <em>much</em> more difficult. It requires the same coordination of many muscles, balancing and constantly adjusting their effort to hold a bone in position, but now the joints need to move. The body must choreograph, synchronize, and precision control dozens of muscles for even small, subtle movements. Thankfully, all of this is completely unconscious, because doing it manually would be a nightmare. To get a sense of this, check out the game <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>. It’s a stupid, frustrating game, but a good illustration of the problem. It’s much easier to unconsciously control the thirty-odd muscles in each hand to type those four letters than it is to consciously control the four simulated muscles that make the QWOP guy run.</p>



<p>How do we do it? The brain has a dedicated subprocessor for controlling the body. The largest part of the human brain is the cortex, home to our perception, comprehension, higher level thought, and decision making. It’s a sort of general purpose computer that works across many modalities. Below that are several special-purpose brain regions that serve as an interface to the body. They are “neural networks” by definition, but with highly specialized design and function very different from the cortex. One of these brain regions is the cerebellum, and its main job is to produce precisely timed sequences of nerve impulses to control the body. We aren’t conscious of what’s happening in the cerebellum because it’s actually much older than our conscious minds. Every vertebrate has one, going back hundreds of millions of years.</p>



<p>The key trick to the cerebellum’s function is a feedback loop. The cerebellum doesn’t just “move the body.” It can only get it right by constantly monitoring how the body and each muscle responds to its signals, noticing any deviations from the ideal, and then adjusting its signals to compensate. This is necessary, because the body has to perform in any position, even under the influence of outside forces, even when some muscles are stiff, weak, tired, or injured. There’s no fixed control program that can work in all of those circumstances, so the cerebellum must adapt in real time. This is also how it learns. Each error is a lesson for the future. With practice, the cerebellum gets better at predicting how the body will respond to its signals, the errors get smaller, and the necessary corrections become more subtle.</p>



<p>As an example, my cerebellum wasn’t born knowing how to do yoga. I had to learn by trial and error. When I first tried getting into those shapes, I did a pretty bad job of it. My form was sloppy, and “wrong” in many details. My balance was precarious. My motion was awkward and jerky. I overused some muscles and neglected others entirely. But my teachers pointed out what I did wrong, and I made corrections. By performing the same motions again and again, learning what the right posture feels like and what adjustments to make, I built up muscle memory. Now I can just think “warrior II” and my body delivers effortlessly. I taught my cerebellum a new motion control program, and now I can invoke that program at will.</p>



<p>The real value of this unconscious mastery is how it frees up my mind. For instance, when I walk a familiar path, it’s like turning on autopilot. While my cerebellum takes care of putting one foot in front of the other, my <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/07/06/mindfulness-and-the-default-mode-network/">default mode network</a> can reflect, imagine, and make plans. This is a powerful form of multitasking, but it’s not always desired. For instance, in my yoga practice, I pay close attention to what my body is doing, even though that’s no longer necessary to perform the poses. The result is increased awareness, precision, and control in my movements, both right now and in the future. Practice lets my cerebellum refine its programming and learn layers of nuance that increase my skill level, but only if I pay attention. In other words, mastering a movement gives me the freedom to turn my mind to other things, <em>or</em> to focus on the performance, resulting in better quality and learning. I can’t do both at the same time.</p>



<p>The ability to control large, complex bodies and to think about other things at the same is amazing, but the cerebellum’s <em>adaptability</em> is even more important. Although some vertebrates are born knowing how to walk or swim, we all learn new ways of moving. This is how we adapt and recover after an injury, whether it’s a twisted ankle or a lost limb. It’s also how many species are able to use tools. The cerebellum doesn’t have a fixed image of the body and its limits, it can learn to contract or expand that image as needed. This also means it can learn to operate whatever body it’s born into. Vertebrates have evolved a huge range of bodies which can swim, crawl, walk, dig, climb, or fly. Each new form started off as a “birth defect,” but thanks to the adaptive powers of the cerebellum, sometimes these were not fatal flaws, but opportunities to explore new ways of living.</p>



<p>This is just one example of how our unconscious intelligence improves our daily lives <em>and</em> our ability to adapt over evolutionary time. This one happens to be part of the brain, but not the mind as we usually think of it. How does this fit with your experience? What’s it like coordinating the conscious and unconscious parts of your brain? If you’re into athletics, how do you think about training your mind as well as your body? Does this raise any more questions for you about how we think and move? If so, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Emotions are a challenging topic. I’ve spent years learning to recognize and manage my own emotions in a productive way. I’ve also done a lot of reading, learning from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral biology how emotions work on a theoretical and practical level. That’s useful, but the actual experience of emotions and how they shape our minds, our well-being, and our lives is incredibly subtle and complicated. I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand it, but I find it fascinating because emotions serve as a sort of interface between two different kinds of human intelligence: the body and the mind.</p>



<p>I like to think of the body as an autonomous robot. It does its best to survive, sustain itself, and react appropriately to whatever&#8217;s happening, recruiting the mind to understand the world and make wise decisions. That robot has evolved many different modes of behavior, each suited to particular needs, problems, and contexts. One of the main challenges for controlling the body, then, is choosing which state to be in right now. Should I look for food? Flirt with a potential mate? Take shelter and conserve my energy? Run for my life? Being successful means constantly monitoring my situation, dynamically switching from state to state, to make sure my behaviors fit the moment.</p>



<p>In human beings, there are tons of these “states,” but they’re hard to count since they’re so multi-dimensional and blurred at the edges. Some of the most notable ones are the core emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger), but others are directly tied to the body’s function, like hunger, arousal, and fatigue. The state of the body is decided by a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters in the bloodstream, which coordinate activity across all the organ systems. They evolved before the brain, which is why the mind has only an indirect awareness of them. It experiences them as “feelings,” often by interpreting subtle and ambiguous signals like a flush of heat, a stirring in the guts, or a racing pulse.</p>



<p>That said, the brain plays a crucial role in emotions. The mind interprets what’s going on in the world to help trigger the right emotions, and emotions reconfigure the brain to serve in whatever activity the body is doing. Those chemicals in my bloodstream tune parts of my brain to be more or less active, reshaping my perception, judgment, and impulses. They shift my patterns of thought and behavior dramatically, whether I like it or not. When I’m angry, I’m more likely to perceive someone as a threat. I’m less likely to stop and think, and more likely to lash out. Looking back at the situation later with a clear head (that is, one that’s not flooded with neurotransmitters), I might see things very differently. That’s part of why recognizing emotions is so hard. Noticing and understanding are cognitive processes, happening inside my mind, while it’s being warped or even impaired by those emotions.</p>



<p>Another important factor at play here is how <em>non-linear</em> brains are. They’re collections of many different special-purpose sub-networks. These all work together in concert, combining their efforts, calling on each other, and riffing off each other to produce my stream of consciousness. This is an extremely powerful tool for creative thinking, quick intuitive action, and using metaphor to recall relevant experiences from the past. The flip side is that causality becomes very muddled. Ideas flow into one another in a sort of free-associative cascade, often forming self-reinforcing cycles. Every thought in my head is simultaneously cause <em>and</em> effect.</p>



<p>All these brain networks, ideas, and memories are linked together by associations, which cause them to resonate with each other and activate at the same time. These associations are often based on similarity or relevance, but emotions make some of the strongest and most common links. Most thoughts have emotional significance, and thinking those thoughts will evoke the associated feelings. Similarly, feelings evoke associated thoughts. More subtly, emotions also change my sense of salience. When I’m mad, I’m more likely to <em>notice</em> and fixate on thoughts and observations that resonate with that feeling of anger, while others get ignored.</p>



<p>This explains why it’s so hard to identify <em>why</em> I’m feeling an emotion. As a human being, I have a body evolved to react to immediate threats and opportunities, and a mind that spends much of its time thinking about abstract concepts, world events, and possible futures. This makes it very easy to misattribute my emotions. When I notice a feeling, I tend to associate it with whatever I was thinking or experiencing at that moment. This is often wrong, and that can cause problems.</p>



<p>A perfect example is displaced aggression. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, I was suddenly faced with many intense emotions, like anger, sadness, and fear. I carried these with me all the time, but there was little I could do to help, so I tried not to dwell on them. Nonetheless, I was much more irritable than usual. It was like my personality changed, and in a sense, it really did. I’d overreact to small slights and setbacks. I was more critical, aggressive, and impatient. I’d fixate on some insignificant detail from an email or meeting to the point where I’d be fuming  about it when I got home. I managed to stay professional and respectful at work, but it took a real effort to do so.</p>



<p>It’s worth emphasizing how harmful misattributing emotions can be. When I’m mad, anyone who crosses my path may stir that anger just by chance, tempting me to lash out. This means the people I interact with most—my coworkers, family, and friends—are the ones most at risk. There’s also the harm done to myself. When my dad was sick, I managed not to worry about that all the time, but mostly by worrying about <em>other</em> things instead. The distractions were easier to face, but also emotional and not really more productive. They did nothing to relieve my stress and irritability, which lingered on until I faced the root cause and processed those emotions.</p>



<p>Understanding all this has led me to a practice that I find works really well. Sometimes an idea or an experience gets me suddenly riled up and emotional. Often it’s something small and petty, or something grand and abstract, both good signs that the emotion is an overreaction. Whatever thought I’m having stirs up strong feelings, which in turn drives me to obsess more on the thought in an escalating cycle. I find myself ranting or ruminating. When I notice that happening, I try to calm myself down, get some exercise, and take a break to let the neurotransmitters dissipate so I can think clearly. Then, I can use the following technique.</p>



<p>I set aside the idea that bothered me, and instead I focus on the feelings that idea stirs up. I sit with them for a moment, and then I look at what <em>other</em> ideas resonate with them. Usually, there are several. Some are big, some small. Some are immediate and concrete, some distant and abstract. Often there’s one that stands out among all the others as the most salient, and it isn’t necessarily the idea I started with. That’s when I think, “Oh! So <em>that’s</em> what this is really about.” In other cases, I find lots of little things, unrelated, but piling on all at once. This helps me realize there’s no one cause for how I’m feeling right now, and it’s not fair or useful to blame a scapegoat for my generally bad day.</p>



<p>Emotions are a critical part of how the mind works. They define human values, shape our activities, and motivate everything we do. I hope reflecting on my own experience helps illuminate that. How does it resonate with you? Is your experience similar or different? Have you noticed other quirks about your emotions, your thoughts, and how they interact? Computers are generally emotionless, but a few chat bots simulate human-like emotion, and some agent-based AIs have their own system of states and “feelings,” suited to their artificial task and environment. How do you feel about emotional AIs?  I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I spend a lot of time in my own head. I’m a planner and a bit of a perfectionist. Part of me would love to always be in control of my life and everything in it (while another part of me realizes that would be <em>disastrous</em>). So, it’s been unsettling to learn how much of what my mind does is because of outside factors, like the way my brain is built, the situation I’m in, and my experiences growing up. In another sense, though, it’s a relief. Recognizing that my mind is limited, quirky, not entirely in my control, and less flexible than I imagined has helped me to loosen my grip. It’s helped me to go with the flow, and to channel my mental energy in more productive ways.</p>



<p>One example of this is focus, or being “in the moment.” This is something I often struggle with. My mind is hyperactive. It’s always chewing on something, which can be incredibly distracting. Worse yet, my mind is often obsessing over unhelpful things. I worry about that awkward disagreement I had with my coworker. What were they thinking? Is this going to be an ongoing problem between us? Or perhaps second-guessing myself. Was that email I sent too hostile? Did I remember to cross off the last TODO before submitting my work? These thoughts come unbidden when I should be paying attention to this meeting, the road, or my yoga class. I feel like I’m being neurotic and too harsh on myself, but worse: I’m <em>not</em> doing the thing I meant to do. I’ve lost control.</p>



<p>What’s going on here? Why do I think what I think? Sometimes I choose to direct my thoughts. Sometimes a trigger in my environment does it for me. Very often, though, my mind is just “wandering.” But what does that mean? MRI studies have taught us a lot, actually. When the mind is idling, there are a few specific brain regions that activate in a distinctive pattern, which is generally consistent across people and cultures. From the inside, it feels like the mind cycles through a few common modes of thought, checking which ones have something to say right now. Sometimes ideas come and go, and sometimes I get sucked into one and lose myself in rumination. It’s a bit like flipping through TV channels to see what’s on. Neuroscientists call this the Default Mode Network, or DMN. It’s part of how the brain is built–part of our human programming. When our minds are idle, performing some rote activity, or unable to hold focus, “wandering” is just what they do.</p>



<p>I came to understand the DMN much more clearly when I realized its connection with meditation. For many years, I thought I sucked at meditation. Like many people, I found it difficult to sit in stillness and think of nothing. It seemed ridiculous to devote hours to this practice just so I could… clear my mind? What’s the point of that? My perspective changed when I got into yoga. Rather than doing nothing, I was doing <em>something</em>: moving, balancing, breathing, paying close attention to my body. Rather than clearing my mind, I practiced feeling the subtle, reciprocal interactions between body and mind. I could see it improve my mood, my health, and my posture, so the value was clear. I also found it to be much easier for me than other forms of meditation (though still challenging, especially once the poses became familiar).</p>



<p>My teachers explained that we all have a “monkey mind,” with a short attention span and a penchant to worry. It’s obsessed with desires, relationships, and critiques. It worries about the past and the present. This isn’t <em>bad</em>, it’s merely human. We can’t just stop doing it, and that’s totally fine. That isn’t the purpose of meditation. Most of the practice is to watch and learn. As I did that, I recognized the connection with neuroscience. The “monkey mind” is just another name for the DMN, and meditation is a way to study it. When does it kick in? What does that feel like? Where does my mind tend to go when it wanders? How can I notice when a thought is off topic? What is it like for that thought to persist, expand, and fill my mind? Can I notice that happening, intervene, and dismiss the thought before it fully blossoms?</p>



<p>In some meditative traditions, the explicit goal is to completely clear the mind and dwell in stillness. That’s totally possible, but it takes years of devoted practice, and it’s definitely <em>not</em> my goal. I see the DMN as pretty useful, actually. It’s nature’s way of ensuring that I reflect on the things going on in my life, the health of my relationships, my plans for the future, and the quality of my work and decisions. My brain automatically notices when it’s under-utilized, and finds ways to fill that space with something which might be useful. I often enjoy it, and it’s often productive. The only problem is when I spend too much time ruminating, or when the thoughts turn toxic, fixating on my faults, wild speculations, and things I cannot change. I want to avoid that, and mindfulness helps me do so.</p>



<p>I used to identify very strongly with my mind. My thoughts were all I had. They were <em>me</em>. I believed that every thought was an important expression of myself, and that I <em>had</em> to listen because the thoughts were in control. It almost seemed like, if my mind went quiet, I would cease to exist. For me, the value of meditation was in shaking off this mindset. I am not my mind. I <em>have</em> a mind. It feels good to merely exist in my body, with no thoughts at all, even if that rarely happens. When my DMN stirs up thoughts, I needn’t attend to them if I don’t want to. That constant churn of semi-random ideas is how my brain provides the raw materials of thought. Sometimes it’s important or insightful, but often it’s just noise. I find it useful to check in now and again: what am I thinking? Does it serve me right now? If not, can I let it go? If the thought is too stubborn, perhaps I should act on it. Is there something I could do right now to quickly resolve it and move on?</p>



<p>What do you think? Does my experience resonate with you? How do you feel about going on autopilot, and having your mind wander? Do you resist it or embrace it? Does it do more good or harm? Are there other aspects of how the mind works that you’d like me to explore on this blog? Let me know in the comments.</p>
