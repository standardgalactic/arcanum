<p>I‚Äôm at an interesting moment in my studies, so I thought I‚Äôd let you know what‚Äôs going on!</p>



<p>Year two of my PhD program has begun. I‚Äôm about a month into my third semester, and things are going well. I‚Äôm taking two classes right now: Evolutionary Computation, and Deep Learning. Most of my Computer Science education has been about how to design algorithms and write software to solve different kinds of problems, but these classes are different. This semester, I‚Äôm learning how to get computers to discover their own algorithms, and write their own software. Honestly, the state of the art here is still quite primitive. We‚Äôve found some very impressive techniques, but they each apply to a narrow domain, and we don‚Äôt understand them nearly as well as we‚Äôd like. Which makes them fun topics to study. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The other fun thing about this semester is that both of my classes are built around student projects. More or less, I get to pick projects that fit with my research, and the class is there to help me find the time, resources, and guidance to complete the projects successfully. I like this much better than undergraduate style courses built around assignments and exams that are very generic and may not be relevant to my work. We‚Äôll see how things unfold, but I‚Äôm currently planning to work on two projects that I‚Äôm excited about.</p>



<p>For Evolutionary Computation, I‚Äôm working on an experiment about endosymbiosis. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE">this classic experiment</a>, which examined how bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, and how genetic innovations spread through the population spatially. I‚Äôm going to try evolving a host environment that supports an inner population, a bit like how my gut supports a microbiome. The hope is that the host will be able to design a supportive environment, with different regions that cultivate ‚Äúmicrobes‚Äù with different traits, such that it can guide and coax them into evolving more specialized forms. This is an exciting experiment for me, because I‚Äôm not sure what to expect, but I‚Äôm pretty confident that <em>something</em> interesting will happen.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred.</p>



<p>For Deep Learning, I‚Äôm going to use computer vision techniques to detect interesting patterns in the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/">Game of Life</a>, since I‚Äôve been using that as an environment for my evolution experiments. The Game of Life has very simple rules, but it evolves in complex ways. Most patterns quickly dissolve into empty space or settle into a few boring, stable forms. But rarely, you get something much more interesting. For decades, people have been exploring this space, finding interesting patterns and classifying them. You get huge complex structures that stabilize themselves, change continuously in repeating cycles, or even propel themselves and move at a steady pace. I‚Äôll build a system that can detect and categorize these patterns, so that when my evolutionary algorithm finds them, I can reward it and ask for ‚Äúmore like that.‚Äù</p>

<p>This month‚Äôs essay is inspired by my Evolutionary Computation class, and the work I‚Äôve been doing to develop the specific research questions I want to focus on for my PhD. So, check back on Wednesday to learn more about how evolution got started, and why it‚Äôs worth asking: how does evolution evolve?</p>

<p>(I took this post‚Äôs photo at the Star Trek Original Series Set Tour in Ticonderoga, New York. It‚Äôs a view of the warp core of the USS Enterprise, which is only a few feet deep but looks much larger thanks to forced perspective. The room is filled with structures with complicated geometric shapes, technical looking panels, and dramatic lighting in red, blue, and purple.)</p>



<p>In my last post, I wrote about my latest research project and why I was so excited to present it at GECCO, the premier conference for evolutionary computation. I promised a follow-up, and here it is! Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt make it to Melbourne. Instead, I had a very complicated and protracted battle with my University‚Äôs travel planning system, United Airlines, and the Australian visa office, all from the comfort of my home in Vermont. I couldn‚Äôt even participate in the event remotely, because of the time zone difference. This is all very disappointing, but I tried to make the best of it. I‚Äôve been busy with the next iteration of this project, and enjoying a bit of ‚Äústaycation‚Äù time here in New England (hence this month‚Äôs cover photo).</p>



<p>In any case, my paper <em>did</em> get published, and I‚Äôd still like to share the materials I presented virtually at the conference. It‚Äôs mostly intended for a technical audience, but I hope at least some of my readers will find it interesting. The paper is titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638530.3654259">A Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm for Co-evolving Genotypes and Genotype / Phenotype Maps</a>, and is available for free online. I had to cut it down to just four pages, since it was accepted as a poster, so I also wrote up an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype-results/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md">extended analysis of my results</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1/blob/main/README.md">hoverview of my algorithm&#8217;s implementation</a>,  for those who want to go deeper. There&#8217;s also a digital version of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3x58W46RPuXOkqY6NavS6ndpeaEgiZB/view?usp=drive_link">poster</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ej09sxSULmzwNd65EPQInTUySmsUtiq/view?usp=drive_link">short video</a> overview of my experiment.</p>



<p>I continue to work on this idea, and it is starting to evolve beyond what I presented in that paper. Right now, I‚Äôm actively deconstructing and rebuilding the algorithm. CPPNs are an important and well known part of the AI field, so I‚Äôm trying to describe precisely how my algorithm is different, and which of those differences account for the remarkable results I found. Originally I thought of this research as being about epigenetics specifically, but as I try to generalize and simplify, what I‚Äôm left with looks like straight-up endosymbiosis. I‚Äôve been thinking of this algorithm as a metaphor for a cell and its genes / nucleus, but it could just as easily be a metaphor for an animal and its community of microbes. This is exciting, since I‚Äôd love to do more research on endosymbiosis, and I really like the idea that perhaps symbiosis is the driving force behind intelligence as we know it, fundamentally changing the dynamics of evolution.</p>



<p>Anyway, that‚Äôs how I see it for the moment, and where I hope my research will lead in the near future. For now, though, I‚Äôm wrapping up my summer with a few more fun outings, and preparing for the start of classes later this month. I‚Äôll be diving deep into both evolutionary computation and deep learning, which I‚Äôm really looking forward to.</p>
