<p>I‚Äôm at an interesting moment in my studies, so I thought I‚Äôd let you know what‚Äôs going on!</p>



<p>Year two of my PhD program has begun. I‚Äôm about a month into my third semester, and things are going well. I‚Äôm taking two classes right now: Evolutionary Computation, and Deep Learning. Most of my Computer Science education has been about how to design algorithms and write software to solve different kinds of problems, but these classes are different. This semester, I‚Äôm learning how to get computers to discover their own algorithms, and write their own software. Honestly, the state of the art here is still quite primitive. We‚Äôve found some very impressive techniques, but they each apply to a narrow domain, and we don‚Äôt understand them nearly as well as we‚Äôd like. Which makes them fun topics to study. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The other fun thing about this semester is that both of my classes are built around student projects. More or less, I get to pick projects that fit with my research, and the class is there to help me find the time, resources, and guidance to complete the projects successfully. I like this much better than undergraduate style courses built around assignments and exams that are very generic and may not be relevant to my work. We‚Äôll see how things unfold, but I‚Äôm currently planning to work on two projects that I‚Äôm excited about.</p>



<p>For Evolutionary Computation, I‚Äôm working on an experiment about endosymbiosis. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE">this classic experiment</a>, which examined how bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, and how genetic innovations spread through the population spatially. I‚Äôm going to try evolving a host environment that supports an inner population, a bit like how my gut supports a microbiome. The hope is that the host will be able to design a supportive environment, with different regions that cultivate ‚Äúmicrobes‚Äù with different traits, such that it can guide and coax them into evolving more specialized forms. This is an exciting experiment for me, because I‚Äôm not sure what to expect, but I‚Äôm pretty confident that <em>something</em> interesting will happen.</p>

<p>For Deep Learning, I‚Äôm going to use computer vision techniques to detect interesting patterns in the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/">Game of Life</a>, since I‚Äôve been using that as an environment for my evolution experiments. The Game of Life has very simple rules, but it evolves in complex ways. Most patterns quickly dissolve into empty space or settle into a few boring, stable forms. But rarely, you get something much more interesting. For decades, people have been exploring this space, finding interesting patterns and classifying them. You get huge complex structures that stabilize themselves, change continuously in repeating cycles, or even propel themselves and move at a steady pace. I‚Äôll build a system that can detect and categorize these patterns, so that when my evolutionary algorithm finds them, I can reward it and ask for ‚Äúmore like that.‚Äù</p>

<p>This month‚Äôs essay is inspired by my Evolutionary Computation class, and the work I‚Äôve been doing to develop the specific research questions I want to focus on for my PhD. So, check back on Wednesday to learn more about how evolution got started, and why it‚Äôs worth asking: how does evolution evolve?</p>
