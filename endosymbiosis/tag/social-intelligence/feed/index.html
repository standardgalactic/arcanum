										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello there, reader. I hope you’ve been enjoying the blog. It’s been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That’s going great, but it’s keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don’t think I can keep up that pace. I’ve got a few finished posts queued up, but I’ve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every <em>three</em> months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We’ll see!</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I’d share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I’m about two thirds of the way through my first semester.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It’s electrifying. I don’t know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I’m often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they’re pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I’m reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I’m integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I’m learning isn’t radically new or different, but I’m fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on research yet, but I&#8217;m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others’, and vice versa. It’s helping see new angles and new possibilities. I’m talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I’d like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I&#8217;m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It’s forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others’ ideas.</p>



<p>This is exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve been on my own since leaving Google, and the experience is just underscoring something I know to be true: human minds aren’t meant to work alone. We&#8217;re social creatures, and most of us just cannot reach our full capacity in isolation. At UVM, my mind is constantly stimulated, and I’m always challenged to stretch myself, try new ideas, and make new contributions. I feel I can go much further here, and accomplish great things. Of course, the flip side is that it’s <em>exhausting</em>, especially while I’m still new and figuring out how things work here. The pace of activity is very fast, and there’s much more to read, do, and learn than I could possibly fit into a day.</p>



<p>In some sense, that’s already very familiar. My experience at Google (especially near the end, when I was leading teams) was also a fast paced, continuous, information overload. The key skills for dealing with that are prioritization and time management. I just have to pick what to spend my time on, and let everything else pass me by with minimal interference. Thankfully, I’ve gotten really good at that.</p>



<p>Still, I’m definitely feeling challenged right now, and so busy I barely have time to breathe. There are a few reasons for that. One is just that the pace of life was so much gentler over the past couple of years as I made this transition. I was working very hard, but my work was self-paced and I had very little external pressure. I took my time. Nobody was depending on me, or judging my performance. So, I’m having the jarring experience of suddenly stepping onto a moving treadmill. Only now, after a few months of settling in, have I found a good rhythm where I can keep up with all my work, have a life, and also pursue my own research goals.</p>



<p>This is also hard because I’m running on a very different sort of treadmill than what I experienced at Google. In a sense, it’s easier. I have a ton of work to do, but it’s mostly low-stakes reading, writing, and coding at a steady pace. As a manager at Google, my work was mostly decisions, strategy, and people issues. I spent a lot of time moving from crisis to crisis. I had to act quickly and decisively with limited information. My decisions would have a big, often irreversible impact on people’s lives (sometimes individuals I knew and cared about, and sometimes millions of strangers). I was accountable for those human consequences. That’s stressful! By comparison, grad school work is fun and low pressure.</p>



<p>In another sense, Google was actually much easier than academia, because it was highly structured. There, everyone had a well defined job role with explicit expectations. We had official priorities and ways of doing things that everyone adhered to. Everyone was organized into teams, which served complementary purposes and fit into a coherent whole. Leaders held meetings with regular cadences every week, month, quarter, etc., checking in on progress and aligning people on their mission, values, goals, and priorities. We never lived up to the ideal, but Google felt a bit like a clockwork mechanism. We all had a function, individually and collectively, and we worked together in lock-step to make it happen.</p>



<p>Academia and science are <em>far</em> less structured. Every PhD, every lab, every department, and every school do things differently. There are very few hard constraints, and anything that fits within them is valid. In grad school, lectures and assignments feel a bit more like “recommended work,” and you&#8217;re expected to invest only as much into them as makes sense for your needs. This is freeing, but also in some sense very frustrating. There are no best practices. Nobody can tell me what to do, or how to succeed. There’s very little indication of how I’m doing, or what progress I’m making. Everyone’s working more or less independently, on only sorta related projects, within a vaguely defined scope, based on their own judgment. There’s little sharing, few standards, and plenty of waste.</p>



<p>That said, science <em>should</em> be less structured than engineering. It <em>must</em> be. The university is designed this way to encourage diverse ways of thinking and of approaching problems. The challenge of science is that we don’t know what we don’t know. We don’t know what to look for, where to look, or how we&#8217;ll find it. Very often important truths are hidden behind common ideas and practices that everyone “knows” to be right, even though they are blatantly wrong! It’s important that students can follow in the footsteps of great thinkers and flesh out their works, but also that they can go in completely new directions and find what was overlooked. The chaos and freedom can be challenging, but it’s a necessary ingredient for innovation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Well, that’s what’s going on with me. I hope my thoughts on grad student life are interesting. I will start experimenting with the format of this blog and see where it goes. If you have any thoughts or suggestions about that, please let me know! If you’d like to stay more up to date on what I’m doing and thinking, I’m most active on Mastodon. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s basically a smaller, nerdier version of Twitter that isn&#8217;t owned by an alt-right friendly oligarch, and with much healthier communication norms and moderation practices. I post there pretty often, and I respond to most comments / DMs. You can find my profile <a href="http://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Featured image is a photo I took of a hazy city skyline in Seoul, South Korea)</p>



<p>People love to speculate about what sets us apart from other species. We’d like to think if we put a human side by side with any other animal, we’d be smarter, more capable, and dominant. If we’re being honest, though, individual humans aren’t that impressive. Our big brains only make a difference when we gather in groups. It’s the <em>collective</em> intelligence of humanity that changed the world, not the human animal. It’s less rational, less coherent, and harder to control. With modern science and technology, we’re beginning to understand this collective intelligence and how to shape it. But who shapes our culture, and to what ends? How as a society do we <em>want</em> to shape it? These are big questions, but first we need to understand what it means to be “the programmable species.”</p>



<p>Human beings are excellent at independent creative thinking. Yet, alone and without the tools of society, we’re actually pretty helpless. For instance, our big brains demand calorie-dense food, but our jaws are too weak to eat meat unless it’s thoroughly cooked. We can’t start a fire without physical tools (like flint and tinder) and mental tools (like knowing what a fire is for, that we can make one, and how to do that). Thus, to become fully human, we must be <em>programmed</em> with human culture. We depend on our community to shape us, give us tools to survive, teach us a lifestyle, and integrate us into a network of relationships that form a society.</p>



<p>We’re also capable of programming ourselves. That is, we can think strategically and make plans. We can invest in self-improvement, building our knowledge, skills, and relationships in order to achieve new goals. We invent tools that extend our abilities. This is extraordinary, but not unheard of. There are hints of this sort of intelligence in chimpanzees, elephants, crows, and many other species. They make tools, play politics, solve puzzles, and occasionally invent new lifestyles, but they don’t <em>collaborate</em> much. They may help each other, or use each other, but they almost never work “as a team.”</p>



<p>Humans, on the other hand, work together all the time. We form groups with a shared identity, purpose, and plan. We coordinate so that groups of almost any size can act as one much more powerful individual. This is rare in nature, but not unique. Colonial insects do it. What’s different with humans is how we spontaneously form and break these collectives on the fly. We don’t have to <em>evolve</em> new ways of collaborating. We can <em>imagine</em> them and share them with language. We continuously remake our culture, dynamically shifting goals and strategies as each individual nudges the collective in whatever direction they think is best.</p>



<p>This form of collective intelligence is incredibly powerful. It requires individuals who are intelligent, social, and good at communicating, so that’s what we evolved to be. We’re born craving social connection, stories, and gossip. We have powerful instincts to trust one another, to contribute, to be liked, and to fit in. The result is that whenever humans come together, we spontaneously form communities. Just by talking and telling stories, we build up a consensus about who we are, what we’re doing, and how to be together.</p>



<p>Language was a key innovation, but new communication technologies have made much larger collectives possible, with different forms and capacities. Broadcast media is one such technology worth a closer look. For most of our history, we could only coordinate as many people as we could gather and talk to (this is why the Romans built a vast network of coliseums, with paved roads and courier routes between them). The printing press changed that, making it relatively fast, cheap, and easy to reach hundreds or even millions of people. Radio and television only turbo-charged this capability.</p>



<p>The power of broadcast media comes from delivering the same message to everyone <em>at the same time</em>. Not only can it plant ideas in many minds, but it gets people <em>talking</em> about those ideas, iterating on them and integrating them into daily life. And we talk about them because we <em>care</em>. Our media, especially video, is designed to tap into our evolved need for knowledge and connection. We crave information. We see people in the media, and they become part of our extended social circles. We trust them, emulate them, and integrate their ideas with our own, usually without meaning to or even noticing that we’re doing this.</p>



<p>The problem is that the people on the screen <em>aren’t</em> our community. They don’t know us and we don’t know them. They’re usually personas or characters that don’t even <em>exist</em> in real life. We know this, yet our brains—evolved to be social—tend to embrace them as community members anyway. This illusion changes the way culture is formed. What used to be a more egalitarian, peer-to-peer process is now centralized. A few powerful individuals can put their ideas into the mouths of characters that stir the hearts and minds of many millions of people. Governments, corporations, social movements, and others work very hard to shape the thoughts and behavior of the whole population, and in some ways they are very successful.</p>



<p>Social media is a powerful new innovation, of course. Unlike broadcast media, where the same message goes out to everyone, social media makes it possible to shape every aspect of communication. The platform influences how people find each other and cluster into communities. The platform decides which voices and topics to amplify or stifle. The platform helps advertisers precisely target their audience, understand their biases and preferences, and craft messages with the biggest impact. They construct a customized media environment for each individual (a “filter bubble”) and attempt to monitor and influence each community and society as a whole.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that social media is <em>bad</em>. It’s an incredibly powerful tool for understanding and influencing human culture, and we <em>need</em> that to get through the many crises we’re facing. The question is, who gets to wield that power, and what is it used for? Today, we let big corporations design and control these platforms with minimal restraint. They shape human culture, which decides every aspect of our lives and the fate of the planet, primarily for the purpose of making money; the consequences for society and the world aren’t their concern. That seems deeply problematic, but how could we do it differently?</p>



<p>There are two main problems with the status quo: the goal is unhealthy, and power is too centralized. It would be nice if the purpose of social media was to make society better, rather than trying to make the most money. The main problem is, who gets to decide what’s “better”? There’s no one right answer. This is why new social media sites like Mastodon are focused on the second part of the problem. By breaking up big platforms into many small, independent, but interconnected pieces, they can make a huge and thriving network without any one individual holding too much power. The result is more chaotic and fragmented. Different groups shape their discourse as they please in a more bottom-up fashion. This doesn’t prevent exploitation or toxic communities, but at least it’s more egalitarian and human-centric.</p>



<p>What makes humans special is how we build collectives that adapt continuously. This made our species successful, so we evolved innate biases to socialize. Over time, we learned to exploit those biases to exert more control over society as a whole. People are lured to big media for entertainment and connection, but these days it often feels like the true purpose of these platforms is to manipulate us and extract value from our participation. This raises a big question we each need to answer for ourselves: how do we <em>want</em> to shape our culture, and who should wield that power?</p>



<p>I don’t have answers, but I hope this perspective is useful. It’s uncomfortable to think of myself as so persuadable that I can’t even watch YouTube without some of the ideals of the creators and the platform rubbing off on me, but it’s kinda true. I can try to resist that, but it takes a conscious effort which I rarely even think to put in. The truth is, our minds are designed by evolution to be porous and to integrate with each other. This makes us both powerful and vulnerable, so it’s worth thinking about! We ought to be mindful of what we expose ourselves to, and what ideas we let in.</p>



<p>What do you think? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(This post&#8217;s photo from the family farm circa 2004. From left to right: Tommie, Josh, and Trevor. This post&#8217;s content is inspired by conversations with vet tech, horse person, and my mother, Sandie Gaylinn)</p>



<p>My childhood home life was centered around animals. I grew up on a working farm, with cats and dogs as siblings, and a responsibility to help care for the horses, chickens, and all the rest. I had daily close contact with many animals and we formed long-lasting relationships. We grew up together, did activities together, and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. I cared for them when they were sick, and sometimes <em>they</em> would reach out to me when I was in need of comfort. Although we were obviously very different, and by necessity the animals had less freedom, I found it hard to think of them as “just” pets or livestock. They were part of the family.</p>



<p>I believe that all mammals are very similar in terms of their emotions and intelligence. This comes from many years of observation, empathy, and intuition. It’s hard for me to prove it, yet it’s harder still for me to dismiss it. Humans are more intelligent than other animals in a few narrow yet critical ways, but when I hear someone say non-human animals are “less conscious”, or that they can’t possibly comprehend the world like us, I get offended. It just seems naive, given what I’ve seen. I don’t fault others for that opinion. I assume it comes from a lack of exposure, or from human-centric bias. Of course, I have my own biases. The scientific evidence is far from conclusive, so I figure we should all keep an open mind.</p>



<p>What do I mean when I say all mammals are very similar? For one, it seems the palette of emotions is basically the same. We experience happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and pain in roughly the same way (which is why animal abuse is morally wrong). Each species has different body language, but if you pay close attention, you can learn to read their emotions quite clearly. We also respond to the world in similar ways. A sudden windfall makes us happy and excited, but it may inspire envy in others who see it. This is true whether we’re talking about humans, dogs, or squirrels. Many emotional responses seem universal.</p>



<p>Each individual has a unique personality, which means some emotions and responses are more common for them. Some folks are more optimistic, quick to anger, or self-conscious. Some less. Each species has personalities in a particular range. Dogs tend to be outgoing approval-seekers; cats are aloof and independent; horses are social, but skittish. But these stereotypes only apply on average. It’s common to see cats who act like dogs, or vice versa. There’s also a lot of overlap between species, which is why it’s easy to make friends with an animal whose personality aligns with your own.</p>



<p>When it comes to intelligence, there’s a lot more variation between species, but I wouldn&#8217;t rank animals by IQ. Each species and each individual is <em>different</em>, with unique strengths and weaknesses. Animals can be incredibly intelligent, but only in ways that are relevant to their lives. It’s unfair to judge a horse by its ability to do arithmetic, just as it’s unfair to judge a human by its ability to discriminate odors. Sadly, this makes humans generally blind to the ways animals may be more intelligent than us. We don’t tend to see or appreciate what doesn’t matter in our lives, we only see what we have in common. That makes social intelligence a good example, since many mammals specialize in it.</p>



<p>Horses are very social animals. A herd has a strict pecking order, but it&#8217;s not so straightforward as an ordered list. Their relationships can be just as nuanced, contextual, and tangled as with humans. Since horses spend so much of their time grazing, a school cafeteria feels like the right metaphor. They form cliques, with different levels of status. Some individuals move freely from table to table, hanging out with the nerds one day and the social climbers the next, while others get chased away if they try to do the same. Horses with higher status will tease, harass, and steal from those with lower status, mostly just to assert dominance. Certain foods or activities may become trendy, starting with one individual, then spreading to a clique or the whole herd. Sometimes, this is how a horse manages to climb the social ladder.</p>



<p>When a new kid comes to the lunch room, they usually get hazed. As a prey species that depends on the support of their herd for survival, horses are generally shy and cautious by nature. The newcomer knows they are at the mercy of the herd and must make a good impression, so they tend to suck it up and bear the torment. Usually, they’re welcome to join the nerd table, hanging out with their fellow losers until they work their way up the ladder. Horses with higher social status will make a point of asserting dominance at every opportunity. Occasionally, they choose to extend an olive branch instead, but this is a risky move which can have complex social repercussions.</p>



<p>At least, that’s how it usually goes. When my mom introduced Dakota to the herd, that’s what we prepared for. To try and head-off the worst of the hazing, we put Dakota in an adjoining paddock for a week. This way, the herd could get over their initial excitement, and Dakota got a chance to learn how things worked and what she was getting into. She observed the herd’s schedule, habits, and social dynamics. She saw them waiting in the lunch line and bickering over the water trough and the best grazing spots. She could see who the cool kids were, what set them apart from the others, and how they would assert themselves over the nerds.</p>



<p>When we let Dakota into the main field, we were all on hand to make sure it didn’t get out of hand, and to intervene if necessary. The whole herd quickly figured out what was going on and lined up (in their usual cliques, sorted by pecking order) near the fence to get a good look and wait their turn to pick on the newcomer. But Dakota took everyone by surprise. She stood tall and proud, walked straight up to the dominant male, and kicked him so hard it knocked him off his feet! The gelding, Johnny, couldn’t let this stand, of course. He gave her back as good as she dished out, but after that demonstration of her strength and confidence, he didn’t want to push his luck. It was over in under a minute, and the others were left so in awe of her that they’d spend the next few weeks sucking up.</p>



<p>Of course, violence was what we on the sidelines most feared. Even with no shoes on, as was the case here, a direct kick from a horse can be incredibly powerful and damaging. But we were actually relieved at what we saw. Dakota was going for dramatic effect, not injury. Her blow wasn’t very hard. She managed to hit Johnny in just the right spot with just enough force to throw him off balance. It only worked because she caught him off guard. It ended the conflict so quickly because it made him look like a fool, and shook his confidence. In effect, it was a bluff, and one that worked really well on this mild-mannered herd where even the &#8220;tough guys&#8221; were pretty gentle. A well-timed sucker punch made her look like a total badass, even though she would have lost in a fair fight.</p>



<p>It’s easy to imagine this scene in a cafeteria, but it was remarkable to see with horses, who are rarely so audacious. With one decisive move, Dakota asserted herself as the dominant female, upending the pecking order, and bypassing weeks or months of conflict and social climbing. It was smart, effective, and seemingly premeditated. She had a week to prepare. When she was led to the main field, she knew all eyes were on her. She put on her game face and acted smoothly, without hesitation. Did she reason about social dynamics and fight tactics? Did she choose a strategy and plan its execution? Or was she just improvising, driven by instinct to do what “felt right”? It’s hard to say. I&#8217;d say it was probably a blend of both, and that the balance doesn’t matter. Intelligence is intelligence. This was a smart move, regardless of where it came from.</p>



<p>I hope this is a compelling example of animal intelligence. If you’re thinking, “maybe that <em>looks</em> like a school cafeteria, but what humans do is totally different,” then I ask you to reconsider. People are very good at finding reasons for what we do. The nerds are outcasts, not because of some arbitrary social hierarchy, but because they like Pokémon and other objectively uncool things. We don’t bite one another on the flank just to inflict pain and embarrassment, like horses do. We use words and reasoning to settle disputes, like when we sling insults at each other. To me, it often feels like humans (self included) are behaving <em>exactly</em> like “more primitive” mammals. We just cover everything with a social veneer that makes it feel more sophisticated. When looking at human conflicts, I find it’s quite helpful to strip the words and meaning away and instead look at the raw power dynamics and emotions. Often that explains the situation much better than the stories people tell.</p>



<p>What do you think? Am I being too generous with animals, and seeing what I want to see? Does this remind you of another cool animal story you’d like to share? Any questions about horses that need answering? If so, please leave a comment below and join the conversation. If you want to learn more about animal intelligence, I recommend these books about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379311?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">ravens</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427380446?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">octopuses</a>. Very cool animals, far less familiar to most of us than mammals, and yet surprisingly similar in many ways.</p>
