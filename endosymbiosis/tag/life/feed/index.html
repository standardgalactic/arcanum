<p>Life has been steadily driving towards greater and greater intelligence, eventually leading to human beings, who are the very pinnacle of this trend. Our superior minds are what separate us from the animals. They empower us to make a world of human flourishing, and justify our dominion over the planet. These tropes about intelligence are so common in our culture, they almost sound self-evident. Yet, I&#8217;ll argue that they&#8217;re completely wrong. These ideas are enticing because they appeal to our pride and our sense of specialness, but this way of thinking is destroying our world. So, let’s break down these myths and talk about what intelligence is <em>not</em>.</p>



<p>One problem with this story is it presents intelligence as a linear thing. Life started out dumb, and it gradually got smarter and smarter. In a sense, this is true. More intelligent life is more complicated, so it takes longer to evolve. But life doesn’t evolve <em>towards</em> anything, it evolves in all directions, finding and filling every niche available. Monkeys are brilliant at navigating tree branches and spotting ripe fruit. Trees are brilliant at producing the right amount of fruit at the right moment to use local resources efficiently and maximize the spread of their seeds. Yeasts are brilliant at performing alchemy on that fruit, transmuting sugar into alcohol, which the monkeys love. These are all different kinds of intelligence, and none is “better” than the other because they’re all contextual and interdependent. Every instance of intelligence looks different, because it’s adapted to a unique lifestyle.</p>



<p>We live a very complicated lifestyle that depends on our big brains, so we tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case. Some of the simplest, dumbest organisms on Earth are also the most successful. Microbes, fungus, and plants make up something like 99.5% of Earth’s biomass, while animals (the “smart”ones) make up the rest. Being smart is metabolically expensive. Taking time to think can mean missing a moment of opportunity. Sometimes real intelligence is knowing when a mindless strategy works best. If anything, humans are a great example of how intelligence can backfire. We’ve used our intelligence to make civilization, which is amazing! But in doing so, we accidentally drove many species to extinction, exhausted resources we depend on, and destabilized the global climate. Our kind of big-brained intelligence is a high risk, high reward strategy.</p>



<p>This brings us to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of intelligence. The problem with a word like “pinnacle” is it suggests we are the <em>ultimate</em> form—the thing life’s been building up to, all this time. But we’re not the end of anything. We’re still evolving, and it’s unclear whether our intelligence will go up or down from here. We’re also not the only ones. There are a handful of species that have gone “all in” on the strategy of super intelligence. You know, elephants, dolphins, octopi, the usual suspects. Humans may, in fact, be the smartest of them all, but since intelligence is so contextual, it’s hard to say. Maybe dolphins are <em>more</em> intelligent than us, it just looks different in an ocean species with no hands?</p>



<p>It may seem obvious that human intelligence is something more and different from those other species. We invented the wheel, New York, wars and so on. But that really isn’t because we as individuals are so smart. This is made clear by the tragic case of “wild children,” who grow up without parents or any human community. In the few cases we’ve observed, these children were described as animalistic, violent, and cognitively impaired. They were never able to recover or integrate into human society. Our brains alone do <em>not</em> set us apart from animals. Our <em>society</em> does, and that’s a separate thing, that evolved <em>after</em> our big brains. We’re smarter than other animals not because of our biology, but because of the vast library of practical knowledge and resources that we share with one another.</p>



<p><em>That’s</em> what sets us apart: other species can’t access human culture. In a sense, that&#8217;s because those species are less intelligent; to fully appreciate human society, you need language and abstract thought, which many species lack completely. Yet some species <em>thrive</em> in human society anyway. By being useful (like wheat), or charismatic (like dogs), or sneaky (like raccoons) other species live with us and shape our human world. That’s because nature does not set humans apart from other animals. We set <em>ourselves</em> apart from other life by building walls, by excluding them from our world, to the extent that we can. We decide what plants and animals are pets, food, or pests. Other species don&#8217;t need language to live in human society if we choose to accommodate them. We can coexist with nature in community, as many human societies have, and still do. Or, we can perpetuate the myth that we are special to justify excluding and exploiting nature instead.</p>



<p>And, ultimately, that’s the problem with this notion of intelligence: we use it to draw a line between friend and resource. If smarter is better—if our <em>intelligence</em> is what sets us apart from other life, and gives us the right to exploit that life however we see fit—then where do we draw the line? Should smarter people get more rights and privileges than dumber ones? Is a disabled person no better than an animal? Should we simply recycle the feeble minded from our population? This line of thinking is revolting, and it only makes sense if you believe these myths about intelligence. Similarly, if anything less than human is just a dumb resource for us to exploit, why not pave the planet? What’s wrong with processing all of that biomass, every living thing on Earth, into fuel and plastics? I think intuitively we know why: life has a right to exist, and losing all those diverse and beautiful kinds of intelligence would be tragic.</p>



<p>I’m excited to live in a time when our understanding of intelligence is changing so rapidly. It’s hard to define the word, just because we have so many examples that pull in different directions, and seem to contradict one another. Intelligence is <em>many</em> things, and we’re still fleshing out the full picture. Yet, every day we see more clearly that our old conceptions of intelligence that put human beings on a pedestal were <em>wrong</em>, and, more importantly, that they are at the root of so much injustice and destruction. So, while these tropes are still everywhere around us, shape the way our world works, and may still <em>feel</em> intuitively true, I urge you to reject them. We must move on, and embrace a more expansive view, one that doesn’t start from the premise of who to exclude.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">(This month&#8217;s featured image is a <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/031/01G77PKB8NKR7S8Z6HBXMYATGJ">photo of the Carina Nebula</a> taken by NASA&#8217;s James Webb telescope. It&#8217;s a vast cloud of gas and dust, slowly condensing, with hundreds of stars visible in the background behind it. The colorized image almost looks like orange mountains with a blue mist rising from them, set on a black background with bright, six-sided starbursts.)</p>



<p>Normally, when we talk about evolution, we mean what life does. It’s Darwin’s magic formula. You need reproduction. You need to pass on a copy of your genes, with a little variation, so things don’t just stay the same. Natural selection will weed out the less fit individuals, so they have fewer kids. The more fit individuals become more prevalent and, over time, life as a whole evolves to be more fit. Yet, this isn’t a very satisfying story. For one thing, how did it begin? Did life just start evolving out of the blue? I think story is more compelling if we think about evolution a bit more abstractly. In a sense, the physical universe itself evolves. It doesn’t have reproduction and inheritance, but it sure does have variation and selection, and this has caused it to change dramatically over the course of history.</p>



<p>For the first 370,000 years or so, all of space was filled with a boring, homogeneous cloud of energy and plasma. That universe is now extinct, and for one simple reason: it was unstable. In our universe, stability is the ultimate definition of “fitness.” What persists, exists. Patterns of matter and energy that get generated more often and stick around longer become more prevalent. Those that are rare and fragile exist only fleetingly. The plasma universe is gone because gravity causes matter to clump together. It was like a pencil, balanced on its tip. As soon as it became just a little unbalanced, it rapidly fell farther and farther away from that delicate equilibrium. Plasma condensed into molecules, gas clouds, and stars.</p>



<p>Of course, evolution needs variation to work. To find what&#8217;s better, you need to weed out what&#8217;s worse. For life, reproduction is the engine of variation, but that isn’t necessary if you have unimaginably vast scale. The universe started out with very little variation, but it steadily increased as matter interacted with itself. Gravity caused hydrogen molecules to group together in uneven clumps, and held them there. They sat around for millions of years, slowly growing bigger, until the force of their own weight ignited a fusion reaction. The gas clouds became stars, and in their cores new elements were born. The universe’s population gradually became more diverse.</p>



<p>That’s the counterintuitive thing about stability: it can generate diversity. When patterns become more numerous, and they stick around for longer, chaos starts to kick in. Every star and every planet is a little different. They have unique histories and influences and opportunities. They might be richer in this element or that one, bigger or smaller, hotter or colder, more or less affected by collisions. This diversity only compounds over time, as these objects smash together and interact in complex ways. The longer they stick around, the more they change, recombine, and become more elaborate.</p>



<p>So, for 13 billion years, the universe evolved. Its population became stranger and more complicated. Today we have about a hundred “naturally occurring” elements that didn’t exist at first, but had to evolve through multiple generations of stars fusing atoms, exploding violently, and gradually reforming. We have many <em>kinds</em> of stars, planets, solar systems, and galaxies, that support an astonishing variety of chemical processes that have had a very, very long time to develop. They produce “primordial soups,” pocket environments full of useful molecules for life, a steady energy source, and self-perpetuating chemical reactions. We think this happened at least once to seed all life on Earth, but it may in fact be very common.</p>



<p>I think this story is an essential foundation for understanding evolution as life does it. Because life didn’t start this process. The universe provides energy and raw materials in vast amounts. It provides the chaos and entropy that drives seemingly random variation, and the slow, continual breaking down that causes natural selection to prefer stable, commonly made forms. The laws of physics cause the universe to evolve towards stability, diversity, and complexity, at least for a while, until it starts to wind down again and settle into entropy. Life merely <em>constrains</em> that process, making it more efficient and productive, for the simple reason that matter that does so becomes more prevalent.</p>



<p>In these primordial soups, some chemical systems evolved to enclose themselves in bubbles, protecting delicate reactions from the outside world. These self-made &#8220;individuals&#8221; evolved regular cycles of reproduction, explicitly making copies of themselves rather than waiting for the right reactants to come together again by chance. They evolved DNA to constrain these copies, and make them more precise reproductions of the original. They evolved sophisticated error checking, which made the copies more robust and reliable. But this also gave life the power to <em>manage</em> variation across generations, and thus shape its own evolution. Life evolved sex to further manage variation, accelerating innovation by sharing genetic recipes across lineages. Life evolved an <em>astonishing variety</em> of sexual and reproductive practices, allowing it to evolve in different ways, with different patterns of variation and selection, each suited to a different range of environments and lifestyles.</p>



<p>The physical Universe evolves—in the most primitive way imaginable, but it still produces stability and complexity in a <em>vast</em> number of diverse forms. It generates the seeds of life, without any guidance or direction. Life evolves differently, because it constrains this process, making it discrete, digital, and managed. This started very simply, just discovering chemical reactions that isolate and maintain themselves. But perhaps this is the origin of what we think of as “intelligence” or “agency”? Without noticing, matter became “opinionated,” preferring certain forms and acting explicitly to promote them. From there, life’s “opinions” about itself only became more demanding and elaborate.</p>



<p>We often present evolution as one simple story, but there are many ways to evolve. Evolution is more like a general principle than a specific algorithm. Even just life as we know it, all based on the DNA molecule, has invented an <em>astonishing</em> variety of different and complex ways of evolving. Bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals <em>use</em> DNA differently. They grow, behave, and reproduce in <em>completely</em> different ways. How many other ways might there be to do it? When we present evolution as a single, constant thing, we limit our imagination. Evolution evolves, and it takes as many diverse forms as it makes.</p>

<p>One thing that fascinates me about life on Earth is that it’s all built with proteins and genetics. Every living cell, even the most primitive microbe, has at its core a universal molecular-scale 3D printer, controlled by an evolved programming language, which gets read and error-corrected from a highly stable gigabit-scale molecular data storage medium (DNA).</p>



<p>In short, every living thing, every single cell, is a mechanism of astonishing complexity and sophistication, and they <em>all</em> share a common design. That’s wild. Life could not have started that way. The very first cells <em>must</em> have been much simpler and then evolved to be like this. But then… where are they? What happened to those pre-genetic cells? We’ve never found them. There are a few good answers to why, and I find them all fascinating.</p>



<p>One interesting possibility is that pre-genetic life is long gone. After all, it originated billions of years ago! Earth is a hostile place, and those early life forms must have been even more fragile than the ones we see today. Not to mention, there’s nothing life likes more than to <em>eat</em> other life. If “modern” cells with genetics outperformed their more primitive cousins, maybe they drove them extinct and replaced them?</p>



<p>Or, perhaps pre-genetic life never existed on this planet at all. Maybe the mechanism of genetics is so complex it needs much more time to evolve from scratch. Maybe the process got started elsewhere in the universe, and then got deposited here in cosmic debris. In that case, genetic cells just <em>colonized</em> Earth and adapted to living here. That’s an exciting possibility, because that might mean there’s more life “out there,” and we could find other living planets like our own.</p>



<p>Just as fascinating is the idea that pre-genetic life is still alive and well on this planet. That universal 3D printer for proteins is an incredibly powerful tool for cells, but its primary value is exploration. It makes it possible to invent new molecules and thus new lifestyles. It enables life to spread, complexify, and settle every corner of this planet.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t make the cell any better at living <em>one particular</em> lifestyle. It may be that cells evolved diversity to escape the dominance of the first life forms, that cornered their particular niche so well that finding a new niche was the only option. Perhaps genetics was invented to escape and branch out from this overcrowded primordial environment. If that’s the case, then maybe there’s a thriving colony of pre-genetic life, still clinging to a hydro-thermal vent somewhere, just as it has for billions of years. It’s terribly unlikely, but in theory, we could find it. How exciting would that be?</p>



<p>But what if pre-genetic life isn’t rare at all? What if we just can’t see it? Certainly, if it exists, it would be microscopic, and that already makes it very difficult to find and study. We’ve been cataloging single-celled organisms for centuries now, yet we’ve observed just a tiny fraction of them, and gene sequenced even fewer.</p>



<p>Maybe we overlook pre-genetic life because it looks like “normal” cells? We can now take a census of whole microbial communities by sequencing their DNA in bulk and using a computer to sort out the different species, but pre-genetic life would be invisible to that technique. It has no DNA to catalog. Maybe it uses RNA, which degrades more quickly, and is harder to study? Maybe the RNA is organized differently, in ways that would defy current sequencing technology? Maybe it uses a completely different mechanism, with molecules we don’t even know to look for? It’s fascinating to think there could be a whole other kingdom of life hiding in plain sight.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 2</h3>



<p>(this month&#8217;s image is a photo I took at Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, California. It consists of millions of tiny pebbles of polished sea glass in myriad colors. Each one is improbable to find at a beach, but all of them collectively tell the story of a larger-scale process that explains their presence—many years of disposing of waste bottles nearby)</p>



<p>This is part two of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Every living cell is a universal automaton, capable of an infinite variety of forms and lifestyles. The cell itself determines the range of possibility—what proteins can it make, how will they integrate into the whole, and how will they shape the organism’s life? But within that space of possibility, the gene sequence is the program that determines what <em>specific</em> body to make, and how it should respond to a chaotic environment. That program is of the utmost importance, selecting one specialized lifestyle out of infinitely many possibilities, most of which would never work. But who wrote it?</p>



<p>Life did. Or, in other words, <em>cells</em> wrote the programming for cells, but it doesn’t seem fair to call them “programmers.” A human programmer is a top-down problem solver. To modify some working software, I start by analyzing that system’s performance: what does it do, and how well? I then try to understand how the system works. I read its programming, and consider how that leads to the behavior I observe. I consider how the system might be better, what specific improvements I might make, and what consequences I expect. I design a change to the code, then tinker with it in a sandbox environment until it does exactly what I want with no surprises or side effects. Only when I’m satisfied do I push the code out for use in the real world.</p>



<p>How are cells supposed to do that? They don’t have a mind like I do. They monitor their own health and situation, but they can’t imagine themselves “from the outside.” They don’t understand their lifestyle, their goals, or their relationships with the world except in terms of stimulus and response. They can execute short stretches of programming from their DNA, but they can’t examine the program as a whole, or imagine what would happen if they ran some other program instead. Mutations and cross-breeding cause the program to change, but cells can’t verify those changes in a safe testing environment. They can only make a new organism, release it into the world, and hope for the best.</p>



<p>This seems like a paradox, but only from the perspective of an individual cell. Life <em>never</em> exists as a lone individual. It always consists of diverse communities and ecosystems. So let’s take that perspective. Life isn’t a cell. Life is a <em>vast</em> collection of cells, an unimaginably huge number of concurrent individuals, living and dying continuously over billions of years. I like to think of it as a massively parallel computer. Life learns by accumulating and generalizing over the experiences of many lifetimes. It tries out many lifestyles simultaneously; whole different categories of lifestyles in different species and niches; many variations on a theme, among organisms of the same species. Whether any individual will be successful is hard to predict, because luck is such a huge factor. But by running the same experiments thousands of trillions of times over, life can get a relatively clear picture of what works and what doesn’t.</p>



<p>From this massively parallel perspective, each cell is a processor unit with two jobs. The first job is to live and reproduce. We normally think of that as “the purpose” of life, but from the collective perspective, it’s just the engine that keeps the system as a whole running. Individual lifetimes come and go rapidly and continuously like the cycles in a computer processor. The <em>second</em> job of each cell is <strong>to learn about the Universe and how to thrive in it, then integrate that information back into the system’s programming. That is life’s deeper purpose</strong>. Each cell has a very limited perspective and can only do this in a minimal way. But taken all together, vast numbers of cells can behave much more like a traditional programmer.</p>



<p>A cell has no understanding of what it does or how it fits into the big picture, but, in a sense, life as a whole <em>does</em>. Life consists of every cell, every lifestyle, every program that has worked so far, and all the dead ends that <em>aren’t</em> represented. That’s a tremendous amount of information about what the system does, which parts are performing better than others, and where there’s untapped potential. There’s no top-down designer, but this information, embodied in the population itself, still shapes the system’s evolution. Each cell acts selfishly, but by competing and collaborating with each other, life distributes resources to the parts of itself that are thriving in their niche, and encourages exploration of new lifestyles where opportunity lies.</p>



<p>The big difference between life and a human programmer is speculation. Humans <em>envision</em> the system as a whole and <em>imagine</em> where it might go. When I program a computer, I test ideas first in my mind and then in a virtual environment on the computer in order to avoid mistakes and dead ends. Life doesn’t do that, because its massively parallel, distributed design makes that impossible. There simply is no top-down view, no central authority to perceive and decide, no way to step out of the system for testing. Instead, life just tries everything. It tests code in production. It walks straight into failure rather than avoiding it. <strong>Death sorts what works from what doesn’t. That’s why we usually think of cells as “dumb” and humans as “smart.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>It would be better to think of humans as more efficient</strong>, because in a sense what we do isn’t so different. We both generate lots of options, test them, winnow them down to the most successful, and iterate. I do it with simulations in my brain, life does it with matter in the physical Universe. From a computational perspective, that doesn’t matter. A computer can be realized with cogs, transistors, neurons, or a simulation inside another computer. The materials can be anything so long as the <em>functionality</em> is the same. As individual living animals, it seems tragic and absurd that life must test out ideas by letting things die on a massive scale. From life’s perspective, though, a single lifetime is just a brief use of materials and programming that will get recycled for future experiments. If it were conscious, life as a collective whole wouldn’t regret (or notice!) the death of an organism any more than we regret the death of one of our cells.</p>



<p>You might argue that the human programmer also has <em>foresight</em>. I don’t just try stuff at random, I have a sense of what might work and what probably won’t. I use trial and error, but I <em>prioritize</em> and focus my exploration. It’s tempting to say cells <em>don’t</em> do this, but that’s too dismissive. Cells are quite opinionated. DNA doesn’t contain a blueprint for an organism, but a bunch of recipes that the cell can choose between depending on context. Cells must decide how to act. Evolution has equipped them with a wide variety of strategies and tools, and guidance on when to use them, all encoded in the DNA. This is how life learns from experience, plans ahead, and avoids dead ends. Life explores new paths at random, but it mostly tries out reasonable variations of known working strategies.</p>



<p>Individual cells aren’t much like human programmers, but they do have one thing in common: they write code. Mostly, the cell just copies its own DNA (copy / paste is a popular strategy among human programmers, too), but it makes an important decision: what variations to try in the next generation. This happens either through mutations, or by swapping genetic material with other cells. Without a top-down view of the gene sequence, this can only be a random process. The cell has no idea what changes it’s introducing, or what the consequences might be, but it <em>can</em> try to shape that randomness for the better. Primarily, this means spending a <em>ton</em> of time and energy on error correction, so that only a small number of mutations get through. It also shows up in things like mate selection, genetic recombination, and preparing the environment for the next generation.</p>



<p>I like to think of Darwin’s story as how life got started. Random mutation and selection are all you need to evolve better forms. As we learn more about cells, though, we see there’s a lot more going on. Life didn’t just find better lifestyles, it invented a general purpose platform capable of an infinite variety of lifestyles. As a collective, life uses that platform to explore many lifestyles simultaneously, pruning dead ends and investing more resources into exploring evolutionary paths that seem fruitful. Life started out randomly, but it grew more opinionated over time, and it has evolved many sophisticated ways to direct and shape its own evolution. That will be the topic of my next post.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>
