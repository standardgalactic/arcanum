<p>Hello there, reader. I hope you’ve been enjoying the blog. It’s been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That’s going great, but it’s keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don’t think I can keep up that pace. I’ve got a few finished posts queued up, but I’ve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every <em>three</em> months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We’ll see!</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I’d share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I’m about two thirds of the way through my first semester.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It’s electrifying. I don’t know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I’m often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they’re pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I’m reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I’m integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I’m learning isn’t radically new or different, but I’m fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on research yet, but I&#8217;m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others’, and vice versa. It’s helping see new angles and new possibilities. I’m talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I’d like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I&#8217;m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It’s forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others’ ideas.</p>



<p>This is exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve been on my own since leaving Google, and the experience is just underscoring something I know to be true: human minds aren’t meant to work alone. We&#8217;re social creatures, and most of us just cannot reach our full capacity in isolation. At UVM, my mind is constantly stimulated, and I’m always challenged to stretch myself, try new ideas, and make new contributions. I feel I can go much further here, and accomplish great things. Of course, the flip side is that it’s <em>exhausting</em>, especially while I’m still new and figuring out how things work here. The pace of activity is very fast, and there’s much more to read, do, and learn than I could possibly fit into a day.</p>



<p>In some sense, that’s already very familiar. My experience at Google (especially near the end, when I was leading teams) was also a fast paced, continuous, information overload. The key skills for dealing with that are prioritization and time management. I just have to pick what to spend my time on, and let everything else pass me by with minimal interference. Thankfully, I’ve gotten really good at that.</p>



<p>Still, I’m definitely feeling challenged right now, and so busy I barely have time to breathe. There are a few reasons for that. One is just that the pace of life was so much gentler over the past couple of years as I made this transition. I was working very hard, but my work was self-paced and I had very little external pressure. I took my time. Nobody was depending on me, or judging my performance. So, I’m having the jarring experience of suddenly stepping onto a moving treadmill. Only now, after a few months of settling in, have I found a good rhythm where I can keep up with all my work, have a life, and also pursue my own research goals.</p>



<p>This is also hard because I’m running on a very different sort of treadmill than what I experienced at Google. In a sense, it’s easier. I have a ton of work to do, but it’s mostly low-stakes reading, writing, and coding at a steady pace. As a manager at Google, my work was mostly decisions, strategy, and people issues. I spent a lot of time moving from crisis to crisis. I had to act quickly and decisively with limited information. My decisions would have a big, often irreversible impact on people’s lives (sometimes individuals I knew and cared about, and sometimes millions of strangers). I was accountable for those human consequences. That’s stressful! By comparison, grad school work is fun and low pressure.</p>



<p>In another sense, Google was actually much easier than academia, because it was highly structured. There, everyone had a well defined job role with explicit expectations. We had official priorities and ways of doing things that everyone adhered to. Everyone was organized into teams, which served complementary purposes and fit into a coherent whole. Leaders held meetings with regular cadences every week, month, quarter, etc., checking in on progress and aligning people on their mission, values, goals, and priorities. We never lived up to the ideal, but Google felt a bit like a clockwork mechanism. We all had a function, individually and collectively, and we worked together in lock-step to make it happen.</p>



<p>Academia and science are <em>far</em> less structured. Every PhD, every lab, every department, and every school do things differently. There are very few hard constraints, and anything that fits within them is valid. In grad school, lectures and assignments feel a bit more like “recommended work,” and you&#8217;re expected to invest only as much into them as makes sense for your needs. This is freeing, but also in some sense very frustrating. There are no best practices. Nobody can tell me what to do, or how to succeed. There’s very little indication of how I’m doing, or what progress I’m making. Everyone’s working more or less independently, on only sorta related projects, within a vaguely defined scope, based on their own judgment. There’s little sharing, few standards, and plenty of waste.</p>



<p>That said, science <em>should</em> be less structured than engineering. It <em>must</em> be. The university is designed this way to encourage diverse ways of thinking and of approaching problems. The challenge of science is that we don’t know what we don’t know. We don’t know what to look for, where to look, or how we&#8217;ll find it. Very often important truths are hidden behind common ideas and practices that everyone “knows” to be right, even though they are blatantly wrong! It’s important that students can follow in the footsteps of great thinkers and flesh out their works, but also that they can go in completely new directions and find what was overlooked. The chaos and freedom can be challenging, but it’s a necessary ingredient for innovation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Well, that’s what’s going on with me. I hope my thoughts on grad student life are interesting. I will start experimenting with the format of this blog and see where it goes. If you have any thoughts or suggestions about that, please let me know! If you’d like to stay more up to date on what I’m doing and thinking, I’m most active on Mastodon. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s basically a smaller, nerdier version of Twitter that isn&#8217;t owned by an alt-right friendly oligarch, and with much healthier communication norms and moderation practices. I post there pretty often, and I respond to most comments / DMs. You can find my profile <a href="http://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">here</a>.</p>
