<p>There’s something very romantic about “the Age of Dinosaurs.” Before the familiar ecosystems of today, there was a completely different world order. Bizarre and fantastic species, strange environments and ways of living, another planet buried in the past of our familiar home. Yet, that was just one stage in our planet’s evolution—one that’s relatively recent, and similar to our own. It’s easy to forget that amniotes (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and the like) have only been around for 10% of Earth’s history, or about 300 million years. By comparison, single cells were the only life on Earth for 2.8 <em>billion</em> years. We sometimes hand wave over that period and say “not much happened,” but in that time life somehow went from accidentally self-perpetuating chemical reactions to swarms of intelligent microrobots that coordinate by the trillions to dominate every corner of the globe. This was the time of some of life’s most important and profound innovations, including essential concepts that made large-scale life possible.</p>



<p>About four billion years ago, the molten Earth finally cooled enough to form a solid crust of rock that could hold liquid water. Just 200 million years later, we see evidence of cells in the fossil record. In other words, it took just 200 million years for chance chemical reactions to become “self aware.” These early cells had no minds, of course, but they had membranes separating their insides from their outsides. They actively monitored and maintained the delicate balance of metabolic processes keeping them alive. Yet that was just the beginning of the journey, the basic foundation that made all the rest possible. From there, it took cells another billion years to cover the planet’s surface, and they’ve been ubiquitous ever since.</p>



<p>In that time, not much happened… from the human perspective. If you visited Earth at the time, it would look pretty boring. You might notice some slimes or biofilms, but you’d need a microscope to really appreciate that as “life.” Yet, gradually, microbes terraformed the planet. They found and exploited every available source of energy, and developed a molecular toolkit for extracting resources from a dead world. They mined useful molecules from the air, water, and rock, transforming and concentrating them for future generations. They remade the atmosphere, filling it with volatile oxygen, providing an energy-dense fuel for organisms to come. They created a protective layer of ozone that blocked DNA-frying radiation and made land habitable for the first time. This would all be invisible to a human observer because it happened so <em>slowly</em>, but the scale and significance of this transformation is incredible, especially coming from such tiny, mindless lifeforms. How could this happen?</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest misconception about evolution is that simpler forms of life are “less evolved” than we are. The reality is that everything alive today has a common ancestor, and has had just as much time to evolve from there. Even bacteria are highly sophisticated organisms. They sense light, heat, motion, and chemicals. They sniff out food and resources, and navigate their environment. They hunt and evade predators. They learn and remember. They coordinate their behaviors with pheromone signaling. They sustain themselves, repair themselves, and make copies of themselves. In many ways, a single bacterium is <em>vastly</em> more impressive than anything made by humans. Like all life, they’re very good at what they do, but appreciating that intelligence means taking their perspective, which is rather difficult for humans.</p>



<p>For example, microbes experience evolution quite differently than we do. For humans, it’s a very abstract concept. It only matters on the scale of <em>many</em> generations, which may take thousands or millions of years. In contrast, a colony of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. They evolve over the course of hours, so for them it’s a real-time problem solving tool. There’s a fascinating experiment where bacteria took just eleven days to incrementally evolve resistance to antibiotics at a concentration 1,000 times what was originally a lethal dose. You can actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE&amp;t=92s&amp;ab_channel=ScienceNews">watch</a> as the population discovers innovations that allow them to resist the poison and expand into new territory. When they do, they get a brief moment of total freedom, spreading unhindered until they start to get competition from their fellow mutants for the limited space remaining.</p>



<p><em>This</em> is what cells are really good at. Not just living one lifestyle, but finding new lifestyles. In a crowded, competitive world, the best way for an organism to set itself apart is novelty: gaining access to an empty niche, or finding some innovative way to out-compete its neighbors. Doing this over, and over, and over again is how life managed to colonize every corner of this planet, from underwater volcanic vents, to Antarctic ice, to your gut. Exploration and creativity is also critical for long-term survival. On a geologic time scale, niches and lifestyles are transient, coming and going as changes in environmental conditions and competition from other species reshape the landscape. Staying alive means constantly adapting and trying new strategies. On a fundamental level, this is what life does.</p>



<p>This perspective helps explain one of the strange things about cells. Every living thing we know—every single cell, even the most ancient and primitive Archaea—has a general-purpose design. At their core, there’s a 3D printer for proteins, capable of mass producing molecules in a mind-boggling variety of shapes. Those proteins form the structure and machinery of the cell, help digest various food stuffs, neutralize toxins, and perform computations. Importantly, this 3D printer doesn’t just produce every protein a cell needs to live. It can make <em>any</em> protein, from any species, even proteins that haven’t been discovered yet. This would be massively overkill for living in any single niche, but it’s the ideal tool for conquering <em>every</em> niche. This complex, general-purpose cell design was so powerful that it out-competed and replaced everything simpler.</p>



<p>DNA mostly consists of programs for that 3D printer. It’s a collection of recipes for proteins, and cues for when to make them. Life hoards those recipes. They represent tools and behaviors that were once useful in the past. Right now, they might <em>not</em> be useful. They may even be harmful, disabled, and packed away where they can do no damage, but they aren’t forgotten. They lie dormant, waiting to be re-enabled on demand or by accident, just in case they might one day prove useful again. After all, who knows when the next global catastrophe will completely rewrite the rules of survival on this planet?</p>



<p>In other words, cells specialize in exploring the space of possible forms and lifestyles. They build up massive libraries of tools and strategies in their DNA. They continuously reprogram themselves, adapting to any conditions in order to find new niches. Macroscopic life, from butterflies to avocados to whales, is only possible because of this polymorphic quality of cells. They are the secret ingredient. They are like “smart matter” that can act autonomously, respond in real time, take on any shape, produce any chemical, and implement any behavior. Once you have that, it’s relatively easy to program those cells to construct just the right mix of forms, organized in just the right way, to make something much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>I hope this conveys some of why I find cellular intelligence so exciting. Humans are most interested in human things, so it’s very easy to ignore the incredibly alien lives happening right under our noses. Yet, there’s so much to explore, and so much of what we are <em>is</em> that “alien” cellular intelligence. What do you think? Did this help you see single cells or life in general in a different light? Did this spark any questions or ideas? Anything you’d like to see me explore more in a future post? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>
