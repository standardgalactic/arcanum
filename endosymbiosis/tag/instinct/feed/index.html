										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The first life was blind and ignorant. It was little more than a self-perpetuating chemical reaction, constantly rebuilding itself and making new copies. It had no idea where it was because it had no way to perceive the world around it. Even the very notion of existing and moving within a physical space was incomprehensible. It didn’t know what it was, or even <em>that</em> it was, because it had no way to perceive its inner life, either. It just kept on going, making copies of itself, frequently with errors that made it worse or (occasionally) better at being alive.</p>



<p>Eventually, by chance, life discovered something very useful: certain molecules change shape when something happens to them. Some respond to being hit with light, others change in response to temperature, or pressure, or brushing up against another molecule with just the right shape. Life learned to read these signs, understand them as clues about the world, analyze them, make decisions, and respond. At least, metaphorically speaking. In reality, we’re still just talking about chemical reactions here. One shape change might trigger another, which might cause some new protein molecule to be synthesized, or kick off a chain reaction that leads to a cell moving, adjusting its metabolism, or whatever. The cell acts <em>as if</em> it appreciated the meaning of this signal, but without “thinking” except in a purely mechanical way.</p>



<p>This was the origin of meaning. At first, it was a very primitive thing. Life learned to discriminate between “good” and “bad.” That is, it noticed signs correlated with favorable living conditions, survival, and reproduction. Organisms that sought out more “good” signals while avoiding “bad” signals tended to live longer and produce more offspring. In this way, evolution slowly transformed random patterns of stimulus and response into <em>instinct</em>, innate biases baked in from birth, representing a sort of ancestral “knowledge.” Over time, life evolved more nuanced concepts like: light and dark; warm and cold; food and poison; me, us, and them. Teasing apart these subtler shades of meaning helped life develop more complex and successful strategies to survive in the world.</p>



<p>Every organism has this sort of evolved map of meaning (an “innate ontology”), implicit in their genes. It’s defined by their senses, physical capabilities, reflexes, and gut feelings. That means every species has a profoundly different perspective on reality. Fish, for instance, may have no conception of water because to them it’s a lifelong constant with no alternative. However, they have a very nuanced sense of the information <em>carried in</em> the water, which we are totally blind to. They can be very sensitive to things like pressure, temperature, chemical concentrations, currents, and even electrical fields. To a limited extent, they instinctively “know” where these signs are coming from, what they foretell, and how to react.</p>



<p>Talking about “ontology” as something in our genes is a little unusual. Typically that word is applied minds, perhaps just human minds. It’s about how we perceive reality, dividing it up into objects, categories, and relationships. It’s how people fundamentally understand themselves and the world they live in, and it’s heavily influenced by culture. But philosophers like Daniel Dennett insist that the same concepts should be extended to precognitive life, as well. Our physical bodies lead us to perceive and think and act in human ways, laying a foundation upon which conscious learning and culture can build. In that view, our rich mental ontology is a product of evolution, constructed from lower-level, simpler, more instinctual parts that we share with many species.</p>



<p>Like the first living thing, each human is born into a new and unfamiliar world, forced to figure out how to survive from scratch. We do have a major leg up, though: we’re born with senses and instincts and the ability to move our bodies. Our nervous systems carry and integrate the sensations from our many cells to our brain as a coherent bundle of information. Our brains are highly structured, with all the tools we need to make sense of those signals set up and ready to go. For instance, our multi-stage vision pipeline takes in light signals from our optic nerve, then processes them to detect edges, shape, movement, and even faces <em>from day one</em>. As infants, we don’t know what these things mean yet, but our bodies present the information to our minds in a convenient form and draw our attention, making them quick and easy to learn.</p>



<p>But our innate ontology is very vague. We are born with a sort of “knowledge” (or at least a predisposition to learn) that we are bodies that can move around in a 3D world. That world is filled with objects we can interact with. Some of these objects can move, some are useful, and some are alive. We get tired, hungry, and sick. We need to breathe, drink, and eat other living things to survive. That’s all obvious from a very young age. The rest is on us to figure out. How do we tell friend from foe? How do we find shelter? What’s good to eat around here? How do we make a living? What is the purpose of our existence? These questions are context dependent and quick to change, so life hasn’t evolved answers for us. It can’t. Instead, it gave us brains so we could find our own answers.</p>



<p>What makes humans truly special, though, is that we don’t build our ontologies just by trial and error. We talk about our ontologies. We point things out, name them, tell stories, give demonstrations. We learn from our parents, peers, teachers, and the media. We’re immersed in the collective ontology of our species, something all of humanity has been cultivating for over a hundred thousand years. Our minds are built to soak it all in and to very quickly adopt a picture of reality that’s much richer, more accurate, and more nuanced than what’s available to any other species. Much more than any one human could possibly figure out in their lifetime.</p>



<p>This way of understanding reality is powerful, but it leads to a great big illusion: we tend to see our ontology <em>as reality itself</em>. That’s understandable. Our ontology is our window on the world. It encompasses everything we can perceive, understand, and do. Yet, it is not a real thing. It’s an image in our minds, our bodies, and our genes. It’s informed by our genetic ancestors, our senses, and what we’ve learned from each other. But we perceive much more than our senses actually take in. Our brains are running a sort of “image enhancement” algorithm, as seen in Sci Fi classics like <em>Blade Runner</em> and now made manifest by deep learning software. We take in a little data, then use our knowledge and expectations to extrapolate something much bigger, fuller, and richer, making up the details that we can’t directly perceive. That is, we see what we believe. We perceive concepts, not reality as it truly is.</p>



<p>Of course, if our ontology is not a real thing and lives inside our minds, the consequence is that every human being must have a <em>different</em> ontology. They are in many ways similar, sure. We are the same species, living in the same world, with the same basic needs. We may even be from the same community, with a shared culture. Yet, we might disagree about the meaning of important concepts like “freedom,” “equity,” and “justice.” We might have very different ideas about what money is, what purpose a government serves, or how to be a good person. These are not disagreements about facts, but about the structure of reality itself—the framework we use to fit facts together into a coherent picture. These disagreements are particularly hard to reconcile, since it’s hard to even <em>imagine</em> what doesn’t fit inside my ontology.</p>



<p>That was a bit of a whirlwind tour of ontology. I went fast and skipped over plenty, so I’ll ask: what would you like me to go deeper on? Is there anything that doesn’t make sense? Anything that fascinates or excites you? Let me know in the comments. If you’d like to learn more about ontology in its many forms and how it evolved, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526350023">From Bacteria to Bach and Back</a> by Daniel Dennett.</p>
