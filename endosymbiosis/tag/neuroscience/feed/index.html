<p>(this post&#8217;s image is a cross stitch I made from <a href="https://studioansitru.bigcartel.com/product/don-t-be-a-prick-digital-download-only">a pattern by Studio Ansitru</a>. The phrase &#8220;don&#8217;t be a prick&#8221; is surrounded by a variety of cacti in pretty greens and oranges on a light blue background. In my home, it serves as a reminder to myself and to my guests.)</p>



<p>A popular metaphor for the mind is a pilot sitting in a cockpit, monitoring the senses and making every decision. This is obviously nonsense, but it’s an intuitive and helpful metaphor at times. The brain really does have “an executive” that thinks and plans and makes decisions, it just doesn’t have “a mind of its own,” and its power over the self is surprisingly limited. Self-control and -awareness are important for living a good life, being productive, and making ethical decisions. Unfortunately, when these faculties fail, as they often do, it&#8217;s easy to blame yourself. I find it helps to understand how these systems work, so I can set more realistic expectations for myself, which makes me less disappointed when things go awry.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important thing to know about the brain is that it’s not one, unified thing. Brains are modular, with many distinct regions specialized for different tasks. Each region has different inputs and outputs, meaning they each monitor the world in different ways from different perspectives, and can cause different behaviors. Observations, insights, desires, and actions can originate in pretty much any part of the brain. All of these different regions operate together at the same time, and conscious experience is an integration of all that activity. What I think, feel, believe, and do is mostly the product of what specific regions in my brain activate together, and in what order.</p>



<p>This story of how brains work is surprisingly consistent across the animal kingdom. Even very simple creatures, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5010568365">honey bees</a> for instance, have complex brains with specialized regions and global integration that likely creates a sort of conscious awareness. It seems likely, however, that bees lack the sort of self-awareness and top-down control that humans do. Without it, the brain is more chaotic. Each part tries to do the right thing more or less independently. Integration means that most faculties are aware of each other and can influence each other, so there is some coordination and consistency. But focus is mostly determined by which brain region is loudest, and decisions happen moment by moment, without planning or intentional coherence.</p>



<p>Decentralized brains work extremely well, but they have their limitations. More complex animals have more versatile behaviors that need more explicit coordination to generate coherent, reliable, and goal-directed behavior. Most large animals seem to have this ability. In all mammals, it’s more or less identified with a brain region known as the prefrontal cortex, or PFC. The PFC is responsible for monitoring all the activity in the brain. It builds up a rich model of the self, its relationships, needs, and long-term goals. It’s responsible for planning and for exerting control over other parts of the brain. It can shut out distractions and use willpower to encourage good behaviors and discourage bad ones, even when I’d selfishly prefer to do something else.</p>



<p><em>The PFC tells the story of “you,” and has strong opinions about how that story is supposed to go.</em></p>



<p>Although all mammals have a PFC (and many other species have something analogous), the relative <em>size</em> of the PFC varies quite a bit between species, and that seems to correlate with executive control and what people often think of as “intelligence.” Animals with large PFCs are better at self-control, problem solving, and forming complex social relationships. Humans have exceptionally large PFCs, which partly explains why we’re so different from other species. It’s important to remember, though, this is a difference in magnitude, not in kind. It’s likely that <em>every</em> mammal and <em>many</em> other species have human-like self-awareness and self-control. It’s just a weaker faculty for them, one that acts less often, and is less able to dominate the rest of the mind.</p>



<p>The PFC is the closest thing to a “pilot” the brain has, but it’s better to think of it as just one brain region among many. It’s one voice in a chorus. It tends to be more bossy, spending a lot of energy trying to influence or even override other parts of the brain, but it’s not “in control.” Like a corporate executive, the PFC has only limited visibility into what the rest of the brain is doing, can’t afford to stay ever-vigilant, and can’t <em>force</em> a brain region to fall in line, especially when the orders run counter to that region’s nature. The PFC also isn’t capable of doing much on its own. It depends on the rest of the brain to notice things, interpret them, suggest actions, and implement them. All it can do is adjudicate and coordinate. It resolves conflict, makes plans, and advises each brain region about when and how to do its thing.</p>



<p>One consequence of all this is that self-control is actually a very limited and fragile thing. Often, my PFC just sits back and lets the rest of the brain work with minimal intervention. Usually that works great, but sometimes it means I miss something important. I may act out of impulse or habit and not notice until it’s too late that I’m going against my values, intentions, or best interests. Other times I know exactly what I <em>should</em> do, but can’t seem to make it happen. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. I can’t force myself to sit down, focus, and avoid distractions. Perhaps I’m grumpy, tired, or impatient and I do something rude or inappropriate without meaning to at all.</p>



<p>When this happens, it’s easy to blame myself. I lost control. I did something foolish. I acted selfishly and impulsively, like a bad person. In reality, though, this happens all the time, usually for mundane reasons that I have little control over. The PFC is energy intensive, so it gets impaired whenever my blood sugar is low, I’m tired, or I’m stressed. Other brain regions also have the ability to <em>interfere</em> with the PFC, especially the limbic system which manages emotions and the fight-or-flight response. Some diseases (like depression and long COVID) can cause “brain fog,” which is closely related to reduced executive function. It’s also possible to injure the PFC, from a stroke, a tumor, or a physical injury (as in the famous case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>).</p>



<p>Knowing this helps me feel a little less personally responsible when I have a lapse of self-control. It really is inevitable, common, and completely natural. Still, I want to have good judgment and do the right thing as much as possible! How do I do that? One answer is to simply be aware of my limitations and to work around them. I try to notice when I’m hungry, tired, or emotional and avoid making big decisions or socializing at those times. Instead, I might get a snack, take a break, or sleep on it so I feel more in control. The only other good technique I know is mindfulness meditation. Despite the mystical reputation, the main purpose of meditation is quite practical: it trains the PFC. By practicing the skill of observing the mind and exerting influence over it, I can build that muscle. It’s not a silver bullet, but meditation helps me use my PFC more often and more effectively, and it makes me more aware of when my PFC is in a weakened state.</p>



<p>So, in a sense, there really is a “pilot” in every brain. It’s just not an ever vigilant, intelligent, wise, and rational person. Instead, it’s one brain region out of many, with limited visibility and a narrow job description. The PFC observes what the other brain regions are seeing, thinking, and doing and uses that top-down view to nudge them into more coherent and effective patterns of behavior. It’s not “the self” and it’s not “in control.” In fact, it has very limited influence, isn’t always active, and even with training there are lots of common reasons it might grow weak or misbehave. For this reason, having great self-control is often less about will power in the moment, and more about avoiding temptation in the first place.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this agree with your first-hand experience? Do you have any insights you could share about self-awareness, self-control, or motivation? What about being kind to yourself when your self-control inevitably falls short? If so, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>Emotions are a challenging topic. I’ve spent years learning to recognize and manage my own emotions in a productive way. I’ve also done a lot of reading, learning from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral biology how emotions work on a theoretical and practical level. That’s useful, but the actual experience of emotions and how they shape our minds, our well-being, and our lives is incredibly subtle and complicated. I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand it, but I find it fascinating because emotions serve as a sort of interface between two different kinds of human intelligence: the body and the mind.</p>



<p>I like to think of the body as an autonomous robot. It does its best to survive, sustain itself, and react appropriately to whatever&#8217;s happening, recruiting the mind to understand the world and make wise decisions. That robot has evolved many different modes of behavior, each suited to particular needs, problems, and contexts. One of the main challenges for controlling the body, then, is choosing which state to be in right now. Should I look for food? Flirt with a potential mate? Take shelter and conserve my energy? Run for my life? Being successful means constantly monitoring my situation, dynamically switching from state to state, to make sure my behaviors fit the moment.</p>



<p>In human beings, there are tons of these “states,” but they’re hard to count since they’re so multi-dimensional and blurred at the edges. Some of the most notable ones are the core emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger), but others are directly tied to the body’s function, like hunger, arousal, and fatigue. The state of the body is decided by a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters in the bloodstream, which coordinate activity across all the organ systems. They evolved before the brain, which is why the mind has only an indirect awareness of them. It experiences them as “feelings,” often by interpreting subtle and ambiguous signals like a flush of heat, a stirring in the guts, or a racing pulse.</p>



<p>That said, the brain plays a crucial role in emotions. The mind interprets what’s going on in the world to help trigger the right emotions, and emotions reconfigure the brain to serve in whatever activity the body is doing. Those chemicals in my bloodstream tune parts of my brain to be more or less active, reshaping my perception, judgment, and impulses. They shift my patterns of thought and behavior dramatically, whether I like it or not. When I’m angry, I’m more likely to perceive someone as a threat. I’m less likely to stop and think, and more likely to lash out. Looking back at the situation later with a clear head (that is, one that’s not flooded with neurotransmitters), I might see things very differently. That’s part of why recognizing emotions is so hard. Noticing and understanding are cognitive processes, happening inside my mind, while it’s being warped or even impaired by those emotions.</p>



<p>Another important factor at play here is how <em>non-linear</em> brains are. They’re collections of many different special-purpose sub-networks. These all work together in concert, combining their efforts, calling on each other, and riffing off each other to produce my stream of consciousness. This is an extremely powerful tool for creative thinking, quick intuitive action, and using metaphor to recall relevant experiences from the past. The flip side is that causality becomes very muddled. Ideas flow into one another in a sort of free-associative cascade, often forming self-reinforcing cycles. Every thought in my head is simultaneously cause <em>and</em> effect.</p>



<p>All these brain networks, ideas, and memories are linked together by associations, which cause them to resonate with each other and activate at the same time. These associations are often based on similarity or relevance, but emotions make some of the strongest and most common links. Most thoughts have emotional significance, and thinking those thoughts will evoke the associated feelings. Similarly, feelings evoke associated thoughts. More subtly, emotions also change my sense of salience. When I’m mad, I’m more likely to <em>notice</em> and fixate on thoughts and observations that resonate with that feeling of anger, while others get ignored.</p>



<p>This explains why it’s so hard to identify <em>why</em> I’m feeling an emotion. As a human being, I have a body evolved to react to immediate threats and opportunities, and a mind that spends much of its time thinking about abstract concepts, world events, and possible futures. This makes it very easy to misattribute my emotions. When I notice a feeling, I tend to associate it with whatever I was thinking or experiencing at that moment. This is often wrong, and that can cause problems.</p>



<p>A perfect example is displaced aggression. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, I was suddenly faced with many intense emotions, like anger, sadness, and fear. I carried these with me all the time, but there was little I could do to help, so I tried not to dwell on them. Nonetheless, I was much more irritable than usual. It was like my personality changed, and in a sense, it really did. I’d overreact to small slights and setbacks. I was more critical, aggressive, and impatient. I’d fixate on some insignificant detail from an email or meeting to the point where I’d be fuming  about it when I got home. I managed to stay professional and respectful at work, but it took a real effort to do so.</p>



<p>It’s worth emphasizing how harmful misattributing emotions can be. When I’m mad, anyone who crosses my path may stir that anger just by chance, tempting me to lash out. This means the people I interact with most—my coworkers, family, and friends—are the ones most at risk. There’s also the harm done to myself. When my dad was sick, I managed not to worry about that all the time, but mostly by worrying about <em>other</em> things instead. The distractions were easier to face, but also emotional and not really more productive. They did nothing to relieve my stress and irritability, which lingered on until I faced the root cause and processed those emotions.</p>



<p>Understanding all this has led me to a practice that I find works really well. Sometimes an idea or an experience gets me suddenly riled up and emotional. Often it’s something small and petty, or something grand and abstract, both good signs that the emotion is an overreaction. Whatever thought I’m having stirs up strong feelings, which in turn drives me to obsess more on the thought in an escalating cycle. I find myself ranting or ruminating. When I notice that happening, I try to calm myself down, get some exercise, and take a break to let the neurotransmitters dissipate so I can think clearly. Then, I can use the following technique.</p>



<p>I set aside the idea that bothered me, and instead I focus on the feelings that idea stirs up. I sit with them for a moment, and then I look at what <em>other</em> ideas resonate with them. Usually, there are several. Some are big, some small. Some are immediate and concrete, some distant and abstract. Often there’s one that stands out among all the others as the most salient, and it isn’t necessarily the idea I started with. That’s when I think, “Oh! So <em>that’s</em> what this is really about.” In other cases, I find lots of little things, unrelated, but piling on all at once. This helps me realize there’s no one cause for how I’m feeling right now, and it’s not fair or useful to blame a scapegoat for my generally bad day.</p>



<p>Emotions are a critical part of how the mind works. They define human values, shape our activities, and motivate everything we do. I hope reflecting on my own experience helps illuminate that. How does it resonate with you? Is your experience similar or different? Have you noticed other quirks about your emotions, your thoughts, and how they interact? Computers are generally emotionless, but a few chat bots simulate human-like emotion, and some agent-based AIs have their own system of states and “feelings,” suited to their artificial task and environment. How do you feel about emotional AIs?  I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>
