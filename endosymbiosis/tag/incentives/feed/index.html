<p>We tend to think of human intelligence as the power of a single brain, but human beings aren’t meant to work in isolation. Our intelligence is only fully realized in a group setting, where we can riff off each other, collaborate, and compete. But humans behave very differently in groups, and coordinating group behavior is hard. I didn’t fully appreciate that until I became a leader at Google. Leaders can’t just tell people what they want to make it happen. Their work is much more subtle: they shape incentive landscapes.</p>



<p>Ultimately, each person decides for themselves what to do at any moment. This is one of our superpowers as a species. We understand our environment, our place within it, and the choices available to us. We make decisions and plans that benefit us and our communities. This is not a particularly rational process. It’s heavily influenced by our instincts and emotions, through neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin. Ultimately, it all comes down to what makes us feel good, whether that’s a literal reward like a doughnut or a paycheck, or more subtle pleasures like helping others or earning respect.</p>



<p>The theory of evolution often talks about “fitness landscapes.” Each organism is more or less “fit”, or likely to survive, thrive, and produce offspring in its environment. Across generations, a species explores different body shapes and behaviors, searching this fitness landscape for better lifestyles. Incentive landscapes are more or less the same thing, just on a different time scale. Evolution has equipped us with the ability to perceive and predict risks and rewards. It has hard-wired us to make real time decisions that, on average, should improve our reproductive fitness.</p>



<p>As a leader, this mostly means I have limited control over my team’s behavior. Yet, their decisions aren’t entirely free. Our team culture makes some paths much more likely than others. The best metaphor for this comes from sailing. Culture creates headwinds and tailwinds, which determine which paths are harder or easier. Tailwinds mean the wind is at my back, pushing me forward. Paths with a tailwind are more obvious, encouraged, and supported. Headwinds are the exact opposite. Those paths are obscured, high-friction, and full of obstacles. I can still go down a path with headwinds, and may even find success there, it just requires more effort and determination.</p>



<p>Leaders can’t decide what each person will do. Instead, they use incentives to influence all those independent choices, making the desired outcomes more likely <em>on average</em>. The most direct way to do this is with reward and punishment. When they&#8217;re transparent and consistent, they can guide group behavior quite effectively. Sometimes. A big challenge is that everyone perceives incentives differently. Some folks are highly motivated by a good speech, while others will simply roll their eyes. Extroverts may thrive on public recognition and fame, while introverts may dread the spotlight. Sometimes, money is the best motivator, and sometimes it feels demeaning. Punishment is just as problematic. How well a fine works depends on wealth. Some people take perverse pride in breaking the rules, and foster a reputation as a rebel. Sometimes punishment is just an incentive not to get caught.</p>



<p>For this reason, incentive landscapes are quite complex. Making them robust means combining many different factors that reinforce each other, so all together they will have similar effects across a diverse group. Incentives are hard to manage, since they&#8217;re not in the leader&#8217;s control–every person in a group influences the others by the behaviors they normalize, the feedback they give, and their social interactions. Just being aware of the incentive landscape and how each team member perceives and experiences it differently can be a tremendous challenge for a leader. It&#8217;s also critically important. When someone’s goals and motivations don’t align with group incentives, they leave.</p>



<p>One example of how different people experience incentives differently is racial equity. At Google, there is no rule saying black people can&#8217;t be hired, promoted, or given positions of authority. Just the opposite, actually. Leaders work hard to encourage those things. But black names on resumes sound less professional. Black students are less likely to attend prestigious schools, or master all the jargon folks look for in interviews. No one will say “I don’t trust a black person to do this right,” but they will scrutinize the work more closely, hold it to a higher standard, or reassign it to someone with more experience. Despite leaders’ best intentions, black people face greater friction on every path. A supportive leader needs to recognize that, and attempt to compensate without playing favorites.</p>



<p>A leader does a lot of talking. We talk about our team&#8217;s purpose, our goals, and why they matter. We talk about what success looks like. We talk about our values, and how to be a good citizen. We do this in big meetings, so everyone can hear. We depend on folks to repeat the message, model good behavior, and pressure their peers. This can be a powerful tool, but only if incentives truly align with the talk. My infrastructure team at Google talked about the importance of code health for years, but it was neglected until we actually held people accountable and rewarded grungy clean-up work. Tech companies love to talk about their respect and appreciation for women. They make commercials, throw parties, and host lavish recruiting events. But if women must work much harder to achieve the same salary and career progression as their male peers, then the talk is meaningless.</p>



<p>The incentive landscape is highly volatile, as world events and many people continually shape it. I led a project to rebuild the user interface infrastructure for Google Search. I crafted a story and designed incentives to guide us. Then, an adjacent team announced a major redesign of the Search page. It was like our plan to repave the downtown streets and redesign signal patterns to streamline traffic was suddenly preempted by a massive parade with the governor giving the keynote speech. How could we do our job without getting in the way? Anything perceived as a risk to the redesign suddenly had massive headwinds.</p>



<p>My job was to reshape the incentive landscape so my team had a smooth and fruitful path forward. Despite being the leader, my decisions were shaped by incentives beyond my control just as much as anyone else. I was powerless to stop the redesign, so instead we joined in. We prioritized cleaning up the parts <em>they</em> wanted done. We adapted to their schedule, to avoid stepping on their toes. We got them to do their work in a way that also advanced our goals, but we had to be very careful not to slow them down. We made tools for them, so the “right way” to do their job was also the easy way. This let us ride their tailwinds. We had to compromise on our goals, but it allowed us to move forward, perhaps better than if there had been no redesign at all.</p>



<p>A group’s leader has very limited control, but there’s an important flip side to that: individuals have more power than they realize. The greatest misconception about leadership is that it’s something granted by those in authority. More often, leadership is recognized and co-opted by authority. Anyone who influences their peers <em>is</em> a leader. Other leaders will see those influencers as either opportunities or threats, and react accordingly. Whether they chose to support or resist this budding leader often comes down to which path seems easier. In other words, they tend to follow the incentive landscape.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this fit with your experience? Do you know any great leaders who excel at getting everyone on the same page? Do you have examples of perverse incentives undermining the best of intentions? Any thoughts about how pressure from peers and leaders affect your decisions, or how they interact with your emotions and instincts? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>
