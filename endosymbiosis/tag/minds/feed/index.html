<p>Life has been steadily driving towards greater and greater intelligence, eventually leading to human beings, who are the very pinnacle of this trend. Our superior minds are what separate us from the animals. They empower us to make a world of human flourishing, and justify our dominion over the planet. These tropes about intelligence are so common in our culture, they almost sound self-evident. Yet, I&#8217;ll argue that they&#8217;re completely wrong. These ideas are enticing because they appeal to our pride and our sense of specialness, but this way of thinking is destroying our world. So, let’s break down these myths and talk about what intelligence is <em>not</em>.</p>



<p>One problem with this story is it presents intelligence as a linear thing. Life started out dumb, and it gradually got smarter and smarter. In a sense, this is true. More intelligent life is more complicated, so it takes longer to evolve. But life doesn’t evolve <em>towards</em> anything, it evolves in all directions, finding and filling every niche available. Monkeys are brilliant at navigating tree branches and spotting ripe fruit. Trees are brilliant at producing the right amount of fruit at the right moment to use local resources efficiently and maximize the spread of their seeds. Yeasts are brilliant at performing alchemy on that fruit, transmuting sugar into alcohol, which the monkeys love. These are all different kinds of intelligence, and none is “better” than the other because they’re all contextual and interdependent. Every instance of intelligence looks different, because it’s adapted to a unique lifestyle.</p>



<p>We live a very complicated lifestyle that depends on our big brains, so we tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case. Some of the simplest, dumbest organisms on Earth are also the most successful. Microbes, fungus, and plants make up something like 99.5% of Earth’s biomass, while animals (the “smart”ones) make up the rest. Being smart is metabolically expensive. Taking time to think can mean missing a moment of opportunity. Sometimes real intelligence is knowing when a mindless strategy works best. If anything, humans are a great example of how intelligence can backfire. We’ve used our intelligence to make civilization, which is amazing! But in doing so, we accidentally drove many species to extinction, exhausted resources we depend on, and destabilized the global climate. Our kind of big-brained intelligence is a high risk, high reward strategy.</p>



<p>This brings us to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of intelligence. The problem with a word like “pinnacle” is it suggests we are the <em>ultimate</em> form—the thing life’s been building up to, all this time. But we’re not the end of anything. We’re still evolving, and it’s unclear whether our intelligence will go up or down from here. We’re also not the only ones. There are a handful of species that have gone “all in” on the strategy of super intelligence. You know, elephants, dolphins, octopi, the usual suspects. Humans may, in fact, be the smartest of them all, but since intelligence is so contextual, it’s hard to say. Maybe dolphins are <em>more</em> intelligent than us, it just looks different in an ocean species with no hands?</p>



<p>It may seem obvious that human intelligence is something more and different from those other species. We invented the wheel, New York, wars and so on. But that really isn’t because we as individuals are so smart. This is made clear by the tragic case of “wild children,” who grow up without parents or any human community. In the few cases we’ve observed, these children were described as animalistic, violent, and cognitively impaired. They were never able to recover or integrate into human society. Our brains alone do <em>not</em> set us apart from animals. Our <em>society</em> does, and that’s a separate thing, that evolved <em>after</em> our big brains. We’re smarter than other animals not because of our biology, but because of the vast library of practical knowledge and resources that we share with one another.</p>



<p><em>That’s</em> what sets us apart: other species can’t access human culture. In a sense, that&#8217;s because those species are less intelligent; to fully appreciate human society, you need language and abstract thought, which many species lack completely. Yet some species <em>thrive</em> in human society anyway. By being useful (like wheat), or charismatic (like dogs), or sneaky (like raccoons) other species live with us and shape our human world. That’s because nature does not set humans apart from other animals. We set <em>ourselves</em> apart from other life by building walls, by excluding them from our world, to the extent that we can. We decide what plants and animals are pets, food, or pests. Other species don&#8217;t need language to live in human society if we choose to accommodate them. We can coexist with nature in community, as many human societies have, and still do. Or, we can perpetuate the myth that we are special to justify excluding and exploiting nature instead.</p>



<p>And, ultimately, that’s the problem with this notion of intelligence: we use it to draw a line between friend and resource. If smarter is better—if our <em>intelligence</em> is what sets us apart from other life, and gives us the right to exploit that life however we see fit—then where do we draw the line? Should smarter people get more rights and privileges than dumber ones? Is a disabled person no better than an animal? Should we simply recycle the feeble minded from our population? This line of thinking is revolting, and it only makes sense if you believe these myths about intelligence. Similarly, if anything less than human is just a dumb resource for us to exploit, why not pave the planet? What’s wrong with processing all of that biomass, every living thing on Earth, into fuel and plastics? I think intuitively we know why: life has a right to exist, and losing all those diverse and beautiful kinds of intelligence would be tragic.</p>



<p>I’m excited to live in a time when our understanding of intelligence is changing so rapidly. It’s hard to define the word, just because we have so many examples that pull in different directions, and seem to contradict one another. Intelligence is <em>many</em> things, and we’re still fleshing out the full picture. Yet, every day we see more clearly that our old conceptions of intelligence that put human beings on a pedestal were <em>wrong</em>, and, more importantly, that they are at the root of so much injustice and destruction. So, while these tropes are still everywhere around us, shape the way our world works, and may still <em>feel</em> intuitively true, I urge you to reject them. We must move on, and embrace a more expansive view, one that doesn’t start from the premise of who to exclude.</p>

<p>(this post&#8217;s image is a cross stitch I made from <a href="https://studioansitru.bigcartel.com/product/don-t-be-a-prick-digital-download-only">a pattern by Studio Ansitru</a>. The phrase &#8220;don&#8217;t be a prick&#8221; is surrounded by a variety of cacti in pretty greens and oranges on a light blue background. In my home, it serves as a reminder to myself and to my guests.)</p>



<p>A popular metaphor for the mind is a pilot sitting in a cockpit, monitoring the senses and making every decision. This is obviously nonsense, but it’s an intuitive and helpful metaphor at times. The brain really does have “an executive” that thinks and plans and makes decisions, it just doesn’t have “a mind of its own,” and its power over the self is surprisingly limited. Self-control and -awareness are important for living a good life, being productive, and making ethical decisions. Unfortunately, when these faculties fail, as they often do, it&#8217;s easy to blame yourself. I find it helps to understand how these systems work, so I can set more realistic expectations for myself, which makes me less disappointed when things go awry.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important thing to know about the brain is that it’s not one, unified thing. Brains are modular, with many distinct regions specialized for different tasks. Each region has different inputs and outputs, meaning they each monitor the world in different ways from different perspectives, and can cause different behaviors. Observations, insights, desires, and actions can originate in pretty much any part of the brain. All of these different regions operate together at the same time, and conscious experience is an integration of all that activity. What I think, feel, believe, and do is mostly the product of what specific regions in my brain activate together, and in what order.</p>



<p>This story of how brains work is surprisingly consistent across the animal kingdom. Even very simple creatures, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5010568365">honey bees</a> for instance, have complex brains with specialized regions and global integration that likely creates a sort of conscious awareness. It seems likely, however, that bees lack the sort of self-awareness and top-down control that humans do. Without it, the brain is more chaotic. Each part tries to do the right thing more or less independently. Integration means that most faculties are aware of each other and can influence each other, so there is some coordination and consistency. But focus is mostly determined by which brain region is loudest, and decisions happen moment by moment, without planning or intentional coherence.</p>



<p>Decentralized brains work extremely well, but they have their limitations. More complex animals have more versatile behaviors that need more explicit coordination to generate coherent, reliable, and goal-directed behavior. Most large animals seem to have this ability. In all mammals, it’s more or less identified with a brain region known as the prefrontal cortex, or PFC. The PFC is responsible for monitoring all the activity in the brain. It builds up a rich model of the self, its relationships, needs, and long-term goals. It’s responsible for planning and for exerting control over other parts of the brain. It can shut out distractions and use willpower to encourage good behaviors and discourage bad ones, even when I’d selfishly prefer to do something else.</p>



<p><em>The PFC tells the story of “you,” and has strong opinions about how that story is supposed to go.</em></p>



<p>Although all mammals have a PFC (and many other species have something analogous), the relative <em>size</em> of the PFC varies quite a bit between species, and that seems to correlate with executive control and what people often think of as “intelligence.” Animals with large PFCs are better at self-control, problem solving, and forming complex social relationships. Humans have exceptionally large PFCs, which partly explains why we’re so different from other species. It’s important to remember, though, this is a difference in magnitude, not in kind. It’s likely that <em>every</em> mammal and <em>many</em> other species have human-like self-awareness and self-control. It’s just a weaker faculty for them, one that acts less often, and is less able to dominate the rest of the mind.</p>



<p>The PFC is the closest thing to a “pilot” the brain has, but it’s better to think of it as just one brain region among many. It’s one voice in a chorus. It tends to be more bossy, spending a lot of energy trying to influence or even override other parts of the brain, but it’s not “in control.” Like a corporate executive, the PFC has only limited visibility into what the rest of the brain is doing, can’t afford to stay ever-vigilant, and can’t <em>force</em> a brain region to fall in line, especially when the orders run counter to that region’s nature. The PFC also isn’t capable of doing much on its own. It depends on the rest of the brain to notice things, interpret them, suggest actions, and implement them. All it can do is adjudicate and coordinate. It resolves conflict, makes plans, and advises each brain region about when and how to do its thing.</p>



<p>One consequence of all this is that self-control is actually a very limited and fragile thing. Often, my PFC just sits back and lets the rest of the brain work with minimal intervention. Usually that works great, but sometimes it means I miss something important. I may act out of impulse or habit and not notice until it’s too late that I’m going against my values, intentions, or best interests. Other times I know exactly what I <em>should</em> do, but can’t seem to make it happen. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. I can’t force myself to sit down, focus, and avoid distractions. Perhaps I’m grumpy, tired, or impatient and I do something rude or inappropriate without meaning to at all.</p>



<p>When this happens, it’s easy to blame myself. I lost control. I did something foolish. I acted selfishly and impulsively, like a bad person. In reality, though, this happens all the time, usually for mundane reasons that I have little control over. The PFC is energy intensive, so it gets impaired whenever my blood sugar is low, I’m tired, or I’m stressed. Other brain regions also have the ability to <em>interfere</em> with the PFC, especially the limbic system which manages emotions and the fight-or-flight response. Some diseases (like depression and long COVID) can cause “brain fog,” which is closely related to reduced executive function. It’s also possible to injure the PFC, from a stroke, a tumor, or a physical injury (as in the famous case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>).</p>



<p>Knowing this helps me feel a little less personally responsible when I have a lapse of self-control. It really is inevitable, common, and completely natural. Still, I want to have good judgment and do the right thing as much as possible! How do I do that? One answer is to simply be aware of my limitations and to work around them. I try to notice when I’m hungry, tired, or emotional and avoid making big decisions or socializing at those times. Instead, I might get a snack, take a break, or sleep on it so I feel more in control. The only other good technique I know is mindfulness meditation. Despite the mystical reputation, the main purpose of meditation is quite practical: it trains the PFC. By practicing the skill of observing the mind and exerting influence over it, I can build that muscle. It’s not a silver bullet, but meditation helps me use my PFC more often and more effectively, and it makes me more aware of when my PFC is in a weakened state.</p>



<p>So, in a sense, there really is a “pilot” in every brain. It’s just not an ever vigilant, intelligent, wise, and rational person. Instead, it’s one brain region out of many, with limited visibility and a narrow job description. The PFC observes what the other brain regions are seeing, thinking, and doing and uses that top-down view to nudge them into more coherent and effective patterns of behavior. It’s not “the self” and it’s not “in control.” In fact, it has very limited influence, isn’t always active, and even with training there are lots of common reasons it might grow weak or misbehave. For this reason, having great self-control is often less about will power in the moment, and more about avoiding temptation in the first place.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this agree with your first-hand experience? Do you have any insights you could share about self-awareness, self-control, or motivation? What about being kind to yourself when your self-control inevitably falls short? If so, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(This post&#8217;s image is a photo I took of my yoga gear. Specialized tools like my mat, blocks, and strap work together to make my practice possible. They extend my body, and help arrange it in the ways my mind imagines)</p>



<p>I was pretty sedentary as a kid, and didn’t get serious about physical fitness until I was an adult. One nice thing about that is I got to watch myself learn, knowing all I do now about the brain. By practicing yoga and working with physical therapists, I’ve learned a lot about myself, but also how mind and body work together. Mastering a new physical skill actually recruits at least <em>three</em> separate learning processes working together. Understanding this changed my expectations, helped me gain more control over my body, and made exercise much more enjoyable.</p>



<p>When I first started yoga, I was startled by how little I knew about my body. My teachers were asking me to observe and discern sensations I’d never noticed before. They asked me to get into certain poses, using certain muscle groups, and I didn’t know how! I didn’t have the names for these things. Worse, I could <em>see</em> what I was supposed to do, but I didn’t know how to make my body do that, or even if I could. It was frustrating.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s weird to think how ignorant we are of our bodies, given that we live in them our whole lives. For me, a prime example comes from physical therapy. When recovering from an injury, I relearned how to walk up stairs. I’ve climbed stairs thoughtlessly my whole life, and I never considered there were different ways to do it. But the leg is controlled by opposing muscle groups. I used to climb stairs by <em>lifting</em> each leg, using just the muscles on the front side. I learned to also use the muscles on the <em>back</em> side, to push up and straighten the leg. Either set of muscles can do the job alone. Now, I consciously try to balance the effort from both sides, but this never would have occurred to me without knowing a little anatomy.</p>



<p>That knowledge was game changing for me, but unfortunately knowing how the body works isn’t good enough. I can memorize anatomical diagrams, muscle names, and facts about body mechanics, but the only interface between the brain and body are the spinal nerves. How’s the brain supposed to know what nerve impulses correspond to which movements? There’s actually a region of the brain dedicated to this problem, <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/12/07/learning-to-move/">the cerebellum</a>, but it’s not consciously accessible. This is why yoga instructors use <em>cues</em>: they teach little mental tricks for recruiting muscles, and associate them with relevant postures.</p>



<p>Try this. Bend your elbows ninety degrees to extend your forearms out from your body, palms up. Imagine someone’s handing you a heavy platter. You might notice the trapezius and rhomboid muscles engage between your shoulders. These muscles largely serve a supportive role. For many people, they aren’t <em>needed</em> much in daily life, but using them can improve posture and reduce strain on other muscles. The problem is, they’re easy to ignore and hard to describe. But I can turn them on with the cue, and then I can learn what it <em>feels like</em> to use those muscles. Once I can tell whether they’re working, I can often activate them at will. Or, I can just use the cue, as needed.</p>



<p>Of course, conscious knowledge of form and cues are just step one. Muscle control is mostly <em>un</em>conscious, and for good reason. Remembering all the cues, monitoring my body, and continuously correcting my posture is <em>work</em>. It takes my full attention, leaving no room for anything else. Luckily, that’s just a phase. With enough practice, my cerebellum learns the patterns and can take over. I can hand off that work to my unconscious motion control sub-processor, freeing my conscious mind to think about something else.</p>



<p>This is why physical therapy can be so effective. After an injury, some muscles and joints may not perform like they used to. Some links between mind and body might even be severed or scrambled. Recovery means learning new ways to do old activities. At first, this is a nightmare. Without the support of the cerebellum, even just walking is an intensive conscious effort. Physical therapy can be a painful, tedious, and drawn-out process, but for many patients it makes a world of difference. It teaches the cerebellum new motion programs. Potentially, walking can become fully automatic again. The conscious mind can be used to retrain the unconscious mind in profound and lasting ways.</p>



<p>Yet knowing how to move isn’t enough if the body can’t follow through. The hardest part about learning a new physical activity is that the body usually isn’t ready for it. When I first started yoga, my muscles were weak, rigid, and lazy. They quickly became tired and sore, which just made me want to use them less. They struggled to move my body weight, and were so tight that my range of motion was limited. Some postures were hard, uncomfortable, or impossible. I couldn’t keep up, and when I pushed myself harder, I only injured myself.</p>



<p>That taught me a lesson about patience and acceptance. My body wasn’t ready, so I couldn’t do those poses, but I could work towards them. I learned to listen to my muscles complain, and to distinguish between different sensations. Some indicate hard limits I should not push past, but most are just signs of stress, and those can be <em>good</em>. When muscles, bones, and tendons get stressed, they respond by becoming bigger, stronger, and tougher in a process called anti-fragility. The discomfort I feel is just that physical learning process in action. By embracing the discomfort, I could slowly reshape my body.</p>



<p>Anti-fragility doesn’t involve the brain, conscious or unconscious. It’s a kind of learning that happens in the body tissues themselves. My muscles “know” whether they are getting the job done. They can tell if they are actually contracting and relaxing when they get the signal, whether that was easy or hard, and whether they sustained any damage in the attempt. They recognize how often they are put to use, and whether they are usually exhausted or ready for action.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, muscles conserve energy by doing as little as possible. But when I regularly demand more of them, they adapt. They become bigger, stronger, and more responsive. They consume more energy at rest so they’re always ready for action when I need them. They become less lazy, working harder by default, which makes them stronger still. This requires more protein to build the muscles, and more calories to power them. So my metabolism adapts, too. I eat more and my body burns more calories continuously, rather than storing them as fat.</p>



<p>What’s so fascinating is how all three ways of learning work together. With conscious thought, I choose to change my behavior. I master new facts and cues, so I know what I’m doing at an intellectual level, and can execute new skills (poorly, at first). With practice, not only do I refine those skills, but I engage an unconscious learning process that makes them fully automatic. I can focus my mind on the task I want to accomplish, and trust my body will just perform all the complex movements I need to pull it off. My muscles may not be up to the challenge at first, but that’s fine. With willpower, I push my tissues to their limits, and they learn to do what I ask. By the principle of anti-fragility, my body automatically remodels itself, increasing strength, flexibility, or stamina precisely where they’re needed. It makes itself a better robot, one that can live the lifestyle my mind consciously chooses. These three learning processes work independently, yet together they make a dynamic human being, one that can just as well become a yogi, a warrior, a marathon runner, or a weightlifter.</p>



<p>Intelligence isn’t just about brains, it’s about bodies, too, and about multiple intelligent systems working together in complex ways. I hope this was a helpful example, but as always I’m looking for feedback. Is this an experience you can relate to? Have you observed these different systems within yourself? Do you think it helps to know what’s going on intellectually, or do you approach physical training in a different way? Any other thoughts or observations to share? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(I took this posts&#8217;s photo of a banana slug crawling through leaf litter. It&#8217;s shape and color resembles some of the leaves, which makes it hard to spot if you don&#8217;t know what to look for)</p>



<p>People say all sorts of things about the world, but how can you tell what’s right? If you’re not sure, you probably want to see for yourself. Those other people might be confused, mistaken, suffering from wishful thinking, or actively trying to mislead you, but <em>you</em> see reality for what it is. Right? At the least, you won’t have the <em>same</em> misperceptions as them, so another look is useful. But how much can you trust your own senses? How does perception even work, and how come we’re so often misled?</p>



<p>Like most people, I “just see” everything around me. Sometimes, I become aware of my perspective. I move around to get a clear view. I notice where I’m glancing, and I know I can’t see what’s behind my head. Yet, most of the time I <em>don’t</em> think about those things at all. The visual world just seems to surround me seamlessly, with rich, consistent detail in all directions. Objects are plain to see, trivial to discern from most angles and distances. It all seems so obvious, like a simple “window on reality,” yet nothing could be farther from the truth.</p>



<p>Human eyes have tunnel vision. I only see a tiny spot in clear focus at a time. My eyes constantly dart around, collecting many snapshots of the world as I move through it. My brain gets a continuous stream of these disconnected snatches of imagery that it somehow must turn into an integrated whole. It tracks my position and perspective as I move through the world, to piece the images together and infer a 3D model of my surroundings. This takes a great deal of real time data processing, and more than a little creativity.</p>



<p>One thing humans <em>don’t</em> do is scan a scene from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, like a TV camera, capturing equally high fidelity data of a whole scene. My eyes are drawn to “interesting” features of the visual field, gathering much more detail about those, and leaving large gaps over the “boring” parts of the image where I never bothered to look closely. To get a sense of this yourself, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo&amp;ab_channel=DanielSimons">selective attention test</a> on YouTube. It’s pretty shocking how well the brain filters relevant details from irrelevant ones, and shows you only what it thinks is useful. Of course, what’s “interesting” or “useful” is a judgment call, and I’m biased by my context, culture, and evolution. That means I’m blind to important things that I don’t expect, recognize, or know about.</p>



<p>Yet, I don’t notice any gaps in my perception. My brain creates the illusion of a clear and complete view of reality, using a technique called hierarchical segmentation. The image from my eyes is projected into my brain, then layer after layer of neurons <em>interpret</em> that image. The first layer detects patterns and discontinuities in the raw image data: edges. The second layer detects patterns in those edges: shapes. Layers above detect patterns of patterns of patterns, finding textures, objects, faces, bodies, groups, situations, and more. I <em>don’t</em> see pixels, colors, and shapes. I <em>directly perceive</em> the objects and agents in a scene, their properties, activities, and relationships. I experience that as if it were “really there,” even though it’s just a model in my mind, distantly derived from sense data.</p>



<p>The first pass of vision notices low-level features present in the image (edges, corners, curves), but doesn’t know what they mean. Later passes piece those features together to represent larger features (in a desk drawer, that arrangement of curves <em>must</em> be a fidget spinner). Most likely, the lower-level processing didn’t see <em>all</em> the relevant details clearly, but that’s okay. The fidget spinner neurons see enough to recognize what’s there. They tell the edge-detecting neurons what they <em>should have seen</em>, filling in the missing details. This is how I can clearly perceive a whole fidget spinner, even though it’s in shadow and half covered. My brain uses past knowledge of objects, where they appear, what they look like, and how they behave to imagine what was obscured.</p>



<p>This works extremely well, and it’s <em>necessary</em>, since low-level sensory data is noisy and ambiguous. It often helps to have some idea what I’m looking at to make sense of what I’m seeing. Yet, sometimes my brain’s predictions are wrong. That’s <em>not</em> actually a fidget spinner in the drawer, it’s a pile of coins. How could I tell? Well, the fidget spinner neurons projected their predictions down, but looking a little more closely, some of those guesses were clearly wrong. There were some edges that weren’t accounted for, some angles that didn’t fit. The lower level neurons noticed the gap between expectation and reality, so they had to push back and negotiate with the higher level neurons, eventually arriving at an interpretation that was the best compromise across multiple levels of analysis.</p>



<p>What I perceive is a blending of what my senses took in and what “makes sense” for me to see based on past experience. At first glance, I only notice the most eye-catching details and my mind fills in the rest. If I take my time to really look over a scene, exploring every corner and paying attention to details, then my past experience has less influence and I perceive reality more like it truly is. I’m giving my lower-level perceptions the best chance to find evidence that I wasn’t expecting to see, which might revise my first impression. The problem is, I can’t afford to do this all the time, and often don’t think to. When should I bother to put in the extra effort? When should I distrust my own perception of reality enough to double check?</p>



<p>My brain automatically groups every object I see into <em>categories</em>, collections of objects with similar properties. Each category has a mental <em>stereotype</em>, an image that sort of averages all my experiences. This is how I know the “normal” shape of a fidget spinner, even though no two are the same. It’s where my mind draws from when it fills the gaps in my perception. As I gain experience, I learn more useful ways to group things into categories that better predict their similarities and differences. I build more accurate, nuanced, and fine-grain stereotypes, which makes my perceptions clearer. That said, it’s easy to hold onto bad stereotypes. They warp my perception, overwriting key details of a visual scene that might prove me wrong, rendering them <em>literally invisible</em> to me until someone points them out.</p>



<p>Stereotypes play a central role in perception, and all the fancy understanding, thinking, and being human that layers on top of that. Stereotypes are great tools. They’re bite-sized models of reality that let us generalize past experience and predict the future. But they aren’t real. In fact, many of my stereotypes aren’t based on my experience at all. I learned them from other people! Some may be wrong, hurtful, and dangerous, but I wouldn&#8217;t know without personal experience. So far we’ve just been talking about objects, but it gets serious when we move onto people.</p>



<p>I saw this when I worked at Google. They would spoil engineers, with easy access to everything from staplers to lunch to massages. That meant lots of staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and in good working order. These service workers—these <em>people</em>—were generally ignored, treated as part of the environment rather than part of the team. That’s problematic in itself, but also engineers with darker skin tones often reported being mistaken for the service staff. Despite wearing a nerdy T-shirt and an engineering badge, they got categorized as “the help” based on skin alone. They were ignored, or worse, asked to clean up spills. This was demoralizing, even though there was no ill-intent. They just weren’t seen, by folks who were misled by stereotypes and didn’t even notice.</p>



<p>Knowing all this makes me distrust my own senses, but I think that’s a good thing. They’re <em>mostly</em> reliable, but they can fail in specific ways, and it’s important to remember that. It’s also useful to know <em>when</em> to trust my stereotypes. That mostly comes down to knowing where I have deep personal experience and have paid close attention. Where I don’t, my stereotype might be a shallow hand-me-down, even though it feels just as &#8220;real&#8221; in my mind. What about you? Have you noticed folks seeing what they want to see, or hearing what they want to hear? How does this generalize to other kinds of perceptions? How do you try to see reality for what it truly is? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Featured image is a photo I took of a hazy city skyline in Seoul, South Korea)</p>



<p>People love to speculate about what sets us apart from other species. We’d like to think if we put a human side by side with any other animal, we’d be smarter, more capable, and dominant. If we’re being honest, though, individual humans aren’t that impressive. Our big brains only make a difference when we gather in groups. It’s the <em>collective</em> intelligence of humanity that changed the world, not the human animal. It’s less rational, less coherent, and harder to control. With modern science and technology, we’re beginning to understand this collective intelligence and how to shape it. But who shapes our culture, and to what ends? How as a society do we <em>want</em> to shape it? These are big questions, but first we need to understand what it means to be “the programmable species.”</p>



<p>Human beings are excellent at independent creative thinking. Yet, alone and without the tools of society, we’re actually pretty helpless. For instance, our big brains demand calorie-dense food, but our jaws are too weak to eat meat unless it’s thoroughly cooked. We can’t start a fire without physical tools (like flint and tinder) and mental tools (like knowing what a fire is for, that we can make one, and how to do that). Thus, to become fully human, we must be <em>programmed</em> with human culture. We depend on our community to shape us, give us tools to survive, teach us a lifestyle, and integrate us into a network of relationships that form a society.</p>



<p>We’re also capable of programming ourselves. That is, we can think strategically and make plans. We can invest in self-improvement, building our knowledge, skills, and relationships in order to achieve new goals. We invent tools that extend our abilities. This is extraordinary, but not unheard of. There are hints of this sort of intelligence in chimpanzees, elephants, crows, and many other species. They make tools, play politics, solve puzzles, and occasionally invent new lifestyles, but they don’t <em>collaborate</em> much. They may help each other, or use each other, but they almost never work “as a team.”</p>



<p>Humans, on the other hand, work together all the time. We form groups with a shared identity, purpose, and plan. We coordinate so that groups of almost any size can act as one much more powerful individual. This is rare in nature, but not unique. Colonial insects do it. What’s different with humans is how we spontaneously form and break these collectives on the fly. We don’t have to <em>evolve</em> new ways of collaborating. We can <em>imagine</em> them and share them with language. We continuously remake our culture, dynamically shifting goals and strategies as each individual nudges the collective in whatever direction they think is best.</p>



<p>This form of collective intelligence is incredibly powerful. It requires individuals who are intelligent, social, and good at communicating, so that’s what we evolved to be. We’re born craving social connection, stories, and gossip. We have powerful instincts to trust one another, to contribute, to be liked, and to fit in. The result is that whenever humans come together, we spontaneously form communities. Just by talking and telling stories, we build up a consensus about who we are, what we’re doing, and how to be together.</p>



<p>Language was a key innovation, but new communication technologies have made much larger collectives possible, with different forms and capacities. Broadcast media is one such technology worth a closer look. For most of our history, we could only coordinate as many people as we could gather and talk to (this is why the Romans built a vast network of coliseums, with paved roads and courier routes between them). The printing press changed that, making it relatively fast, cheap, and easy to reach hundreds or even millions of people. Radio and television only turbo-charged this capability.</p>



<p>The power of broadcast media comes from delivering the same message to everyone <em>at the same time</em>. Not only can it plant ideas in many minds, but it gets people <em>talking</em> about those ideas, iterating on them and integrating them into daily life. And we talk about them because we <em>care</em>. Our media, especially video, is designed to tap into our evolved need for knowledge and connection. We crave information. We see people in the media, and they become part of our extended social circles. We trust them, emulate them, and integrate their ideas with our own, usually without meaning to or even noticing that we’re doing this.</p>



<p>The problem is that the people on the screen <em>aren’t</em> our community. They don’t know us and we don’t know them. They’re usually personas or characters that don’t even <em>exist</em> in real life. We know this, yet our brains—evolved to be social—tend to embrace them as community members anyway. This illusion changes the way culture is formed. What used to be a more egalitarian, peer-to-peer process is now centralized. A few powerful individuals can put their ideas into the mouths of characters that stir the hearts and minds of many millions of people. Governments, corporations, social movements, and others work very hard to shape the thoughts and behavior of the whole population, and in some ways they are very successful.</p>



<p>Social media is a powerful new innovation, of course. Unlike broadcast media, where the same message goes out to everyone, social media makes it possible to shape every aspect of communication. The platform influences how people find each other and cluster into communities. The platform decides which voices and topics to amplify or stifle. The platform helps advertisers precisely target their audience, understand their biases and preferences, and craft messages with the biggest impact. They construct a customized media environment for each individual (a “filter bubble”) and attempt to monitor and influence each community and society as a whole.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that social media is <em>bad</em>. It’s an incredibly powerful tool for understanding and influencing human culture, and we <em>need</em> that to get through the many crises we’re facing. The question is, who gets to wield that power, and what is it used for? Today, we let big corporations design and control these platforms with minimal restraint. They shape human culture, which decides every aspect of our lives and the fate of the planet, primarily for the purpose of making money; the consequences for society and the world aren’t their concern. That seems deeply problematic, but how could we do it differently?</p>



<p>There are two main problems with the status quo: the goal is unhealthy, and power is too centralized. It would be nice if the purpose of social media was to make society better, rather than trying to make the most money. The main problem is, who gets to decide what’s “better”? There’s no one right answer. This is why new social media sites like Mastodon are focused on the second part of the problem. By breaking up big platforms into many small, independent, but interconnected pieces, they can make a huge and thriving network without any one individual holding too much power. The result is more chaotic and fragmented. Different groups shape their discourse as they please in a more bottom-up fashion. This doesn’t prevent exploitation or toxic communities, but at least it’s more egalitarian and human-centric.</p>



<p>What makes humans special is how we build collectives that adapt continuously. This made our species successful, so we evolved innate biases to socialize. Over time, we learned to exploit those biases to exert more control over society as a whole. People are lured to big media for entertainment and connection, but these days it often feels like the true purpose of these platforms is to manipulate us and extract value from our participation. This raises a big question we each need to answer for ourselves: how do we <em>want</em> to shape our culture, and who should wield that power?</p>



<p>I don’t have answers, but I hope this perspective is useful. It’s uncomfortable to think of myself as so persuadable that I can’t even watch YouTube without some of the ideals of the creators and the platform rubbing off on me, but it’s kinda true. I can try to resist that, but it takes a conscious effort which I rarely even think to put in. The truth is, our minds are designed by evolution to be porous and to integrate with each other. This makes us both powerful and vulnerable, so it’s worth thinking about! We ought to be mindful of what we expose ourselves to, and what ideas we let in.</p>



<p>What do you think? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(This post&#8217;s featured image is <em>not</em> a photo of the idyllic California vineyard my wife and I visited in 2015, but a similar looking AI-generated fiction)</p>



<p>The excitement around large language models (LLMs) continues. Often just called “AI,” this new technology takes instructions in plain English, and generates new text or images so good you’d think a human made them. There are some serious concerns about the ethics of how this is done (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots</a>), and many articles warning people that LLMs aren’t as human as they seem. Still, these LLMs are clearly doing <em>something</em> smart, and it’s weirdly compelling. What’s going on here? What can LLMs teach us about the human mind, our strengths and weaknesses, and why we&#8217;re so easily fooled and mesmerized by this tech?</p>



<p>There are lots of articles about how LLMs work and their limitations (I even wrote <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/06/15/large-language-models-lamda-and-sentience/">one</a> a while back), so I won’t go into much detail here. What matters for now is that LLMs are <em>prediction engines</em>. Given some text, they try to guess how a human would respond, based on a statistical analysis of all the content on the internet. They do this extremely well, but not perfectly. LLMs don’t think, perceive, or interact with the world in a human-like way, so sometimes they make weird mistakes a human never would.</p>



<p>In some ways, the human brain works a lot like an LLM. From day one, the brain is looking for language. It automatically builds up vast networks of words, concepts, and their relationships. When I hear someone talking, my mind is suddenly filled with the speaker’s ideas and their associations, building up an image in my mind’s eye. This is basically what an LLM does.</p>



<p>However, I also have many other intelligent faculties that join in. I don’t just know that “dog” is a word related to “cat.” I have memories of specific dogs, what their fur felt like, and the experiences we shared. I have common sense, logic, and theory of mind to decide whether something I hear is truth, fantasy, error, or deception. I monitor my own thoughts to gauge my level of confidence and correct my mistakes. I anticipate the future, make plans, and use language to achieve my goals. LLMs don’t do any of that.</p>



<p>Of course, there are AI researchers working to approximate these other kinds of human intelligence (though progress here is limited compared with LLMs themselves). <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43999120-rebooting-ai?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=fL2RVBG7dY&amp;rank=3">Rebooting AI</a> is a great book exploring that work, which argues its just a matter of time before AI can do everything a human can. Personally, I&#8217;m skeptical that we&#8217;ll ever reverse engineer all the subtlety of human thought, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say that AIs will become more powerful and well-rounded in the future. Perhaps the more important question is whether building increasingly realistic human simulations is a good idea at all.</p>



<p>For now, LLMs are a bit of a one-trick pony. What’s scary is that one trick is often good enough to fool humans and do useful work. In particular, even though LLMs were designed to be text prediction engines, they are surprisingly good at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">general problem solving</a>. They can paint pictures, do math, solve brain teasers, and even write and simulate computer programs. Maybe those “extra” faculties of the human mind aren’t so important after all?</p>



<p>LLMs “think” in terms of words and relationships and patterns they’ve seen before. In human terms, that means stereotypes, cliches, generalizing from past “experience,” and repeating what they are told. We like to think that human thought is more sophisticated than that, but it often isn’t. We sometimes don&#8217;t see people as individuals, but in terms of the role they play in society (ie, &#8220;barista&#8221; or &#8220;mom&#8221;). We make decisions based on rules of thumb or gut feeling, without the need for logic and reasoning. We talk about things we don’t fully comprehend. We repeat talking points in order to fit in with our tribe. We confidently make up nonsense just to satisfy each other and move on. It’s surprising how LLM-like humans can be sometimes.</p>



<p>And that’s not meant to be derogatory! Those ways of thinking can be very effective. A lot of language <em>isn’t</em> about complex ideas, comprehension, and reasoning, but just putting one word after another to evoke an image in someone else’s mind. Past experience often <em>is</em> a highly effective and low-effort way to predict the future. Lying is anti-social, but “fake it ‘til you make it” <em>works</em>. One of the fastest ways to pick up a new skill is to boldly make mistakes, get feedback, and learn from that experience. The main difference is that today&#8217;s LLMs don&#8217;t learn from their mistakes, they never doubt their &#8220;intuition,&#8221; and they have no alternative ways of &#8220;thinking&#8221; when these techniques fall short.</p>



<p>So, yeah, LLMs only do part of what humans do, but it’s a big and important part. Occasionally we do need facts, critical thinking, self-doubt, and all the rest to do the right thing, but they don’t come up as often as we like to think. The real danger of LLMs, then, is that 80% of the time they might be good enough, but 20% of the time we need fancy human judgment to notice they screwed up and decide what to do. This is a serious problem. Humans are bad at vigilance, and we have a strong instinct to trust language, which in this case is exactly the <em>wrong</em> response.</p>



<p>Language is a defining feature of our species. We aren’t just <em>capable</em> of language, it’s a human universal. Every culture has language. Babies attend to speech from the moment they’re born, and start to babble in a few months. When there isn’t a common language spoken around them, children raised together will spontaneously <em>invent</em> one. Language is a biological imperative for us. It’s in our DNA.</p>



<p>When we perceive language, our minds automatically assume that it’s <em>communication</em>. We imagine another mind behind the words, usually with good intent and a desire to cooperate. Up until recently, this was a pretty safe assumption, so it was totally reasonable for the brain to immediately and automatically translate language into meaning. But now this instinct is backfiring. LLMs create realistic text and imagery <em>without any intentional meaning</em>. They don&#8217;t produce &#8220;answers,&#8221; &#8220;opinions,&#8221; or &#8220;art,&#8221; just random content that <em>looks</em> like those things. It&#8217;s both very difficult and important to remember that.</p>



<p>We’re still working to understand how these LLMs work, what their limitations are, and what they’re good for. As we do that, I hope we’ll come to understand ourselves better, too. What do you think? Have LLMs made you think about minds any differently? Have you seen any interesting examples of AIs acting strange or foolish? What about people acting like LLMs? Any thoughts or fears about computers gradually inching toward human-like abilities? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The first life was blind and ignorant. It was little more than a self-perpetuating chemical reaction, constantly rebuilding itself and making new copies. It had no idea where it was because it had no way to perceive the world around it. Even the very notion of existing and moving within a physical space was incomprehensible. It didn’t know what it was, or even <em>that</em> it was, because it had no way to perceive its inner life, either. It just kept on going, making copies of itself, frequently with errors that made it worse or (occasionally) better at being alive.</p>



<p>Eventually, by chance, life discovered something very useful: certain molecules change shape when something happens to them. Some respond to being hit with light, others change in response to temperature, or pressure, or brushing up against another molecule with just the right shape. Life learned to read these signs, understand them as clues about the world, analyze them, make decisions, and respond. At least, metaphorically speaking. In reality, we’re still just talking about chemical reactions here. One shape change might trigger another, which might cause some new protein molecule to be synthesized, or kick off a chain reaction that leads to a cell moving, adjusting its metabolism, or whatever. The cell acts <em>as if</em> it appreciated the meaning of this signal, but without “thinking” except in a purely mechanical way.</p>



<p>This was the origin of meaning. At first, it was a very primitive thing. Life learned to discriminate between “good” and “bad.” That is, it noticed signs correlated with favorable living conditions, survival, and reproduction. Organisms that sought out more “good” signals while avoiding “bad” signals tended to live longer and produce more offspring. In this way, evolution slowly transformed random patterns of stimulus and response into <em>instinct</em>, innate biases baked in from birth, representing a sort of ancestral “knowledge.” Over time, life evolved more nuanced concepts like: light and dark; warm and cold; food and poison; me, us, and them. Teasing apart these subtler shades of meaning helped life develop more complex and successful strategies to survive in the world.</p>



<p>Every organism has this sort of evolved map of meaning (an “innate ontology”), implicit in their genes. It’s defined by their senses, physical capabilities, reflexes, and gut feelings. That means every species has a profoundly different perspective on reality. Fish, for instance, may have no conception of water because to them it’s a lifelong constant with no alternative. However, they have a very nuanced sense of the information <em>carried in</em> the water, which we are totally blind to. They can be very sensitive to things like pressure, temperature, chemical concentrations, currents, and even electrical fields. To a limited extent, they instinctively “know” where these signs are coming from, what they foretell, and how to react.</p>



<p>Talking about “ontology” as something in our genes is a little unusual. Typically that word is applied minds, perhaps just human minds. It’s about how we perceive reality, dividing it up into objects, categories, and relationships. It’s how people fundamentally understand themselves and the world they live in, and it’s heavily influenced by culture. But philosophers like Daniel Dennett insist that the same concepts should be extended to precognitive life, as well. Our physical bodies lead us to perceive and think and act in human ways, laying a foundation upon which conscious learning and culture can build. In that view, our rich mental ontology is a product of evolution, constructed from lower-level, simpler, more instinctual parts that we share with many species.</p>



<p>Like the first living thing, each human is born into a new and unfamiliar world, forced to figure out how to survive from scratch. We do have a major leg up, though: we’re born with senses and instincts and the ability to move our bodies. Our nervous systems carry and integrate the sensations from our many cells to our brain as a coherent bundle of information. Our brains are highly structured, with all the tools we need to make sense of those signals set up and ready to go. For instance, our multi-stage vision pipeline takes in light signals from our optic nerve, then processes them to detect edges, shape, movement, and even faces <em>from day one</em>. As infants, we don’t know what these things mean yet, but our bodies present the information to our minds in a convenient form and draw our attention, making them quick and easy to learn.</p>



<p>But our innate ontology is very vague. We are born with a sort of “knowledge” (or at least a predisposition to learn) that we are bodies that can move around in a 3D world. That world is filled with objects we can interact with. Some of these objects can move, some are useful, and some are alive. We get tired, hungry, and sick. We need to breathe, drink, and eat other living things to survive. That’s all obvious from a very young age. The rest is on us to figure out. How do we tell friend from foe? How do we find shelter? What’s good to eat around here? How do we make a living? What is the purpose of our existence? These questions are context dependent and quick to change, so life hasn’t evolved answers for us. It can’t. Instead, it gave us brains so we could find our own answers.</p>



<p>What makes humans truly special, though, is that we don’t build our ontologies just by trial and error. We talk about our ontologies. We point things out, name them, tell stories, give demonstrations. We learn from our parents, peers, teachers, and the media. We’re immersed in the collective ontology of our species, something all of humanity has been cultivating for over a hundred thousand years. Our minds are built to soak it all in and to very quickly adopt a picture of reality that’s much richer, more accurate, and more nuanced than what’s available to any other species. Much more than any one human could possibly figure out in their lifetime.</p>



<p>This way of understanding reality is powerful, but it leads to a great big illusion: we tend to see our ontology <em>as reality itself</em>. That’s understandable. Our ontology is our window on the world. It encompasses everything we can perceive, understand, and do. Yet, it is not a real thing. It’s an image in our minds, our bodies, and our genes. It’s informed by our genetic ancestors, our senses, and what we’ve learned from each other. But we perceive much more than our senses actually take in. Our brains are running a sort of “image enhancement” algorithm, as seen in Sci Fi classics like <em>Blade Runner</em> and now made manifest by deep learning software. We take in a little data, then use our knowledge and expectations to extrapolate something much bigger, fuller, and richer, making up the details that we can’t directly perceive. That is, we see what we believe. We perceive concepts, not reality as it truly is.</p>



<p>Of course, if our ontology is not a real thing and lives inside our minds, the consequence is that every human being must have a <em>different</em> ontology. They are in many ways similar, sure. We are the same species, living in the same world, with the same basic needs. We may even be from the same community, with a shared culture. Yet, we might disagree about the meaning of important concepts like “freedom,” “equity,” and “justice.” We might have very different ideas about what money is, what purpose a government serves, or how to be a good person. These are not disagreements about facts, but about the structure of reality itself—the framework we use to fit facts together into a coherent picture. These disagreements are particularly hard to reconcile, since it’s hard to even <em>imagine</em> what doesn’t fit inside my ontology.</p>



<p>That was a bit of a whirlwind tour of ontology. I went fast and skipped over plenty, so I’ll ask: what would you like me to go deeper on? Is there anything that doesn’t make sense? Anything that fascinates or excites you? Let me know in the comments. If you’d like to learn more about ontology in its many forms and how it evolved, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526350023">From Bacteria to Bach and Back</a> by Daniel Dennett.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For the most part, people have good intentions. We generally want to be kind, responsible, and respected by our communities (at least, once our own personal needs are met). We have worthy goals and dreams for how to make life better. Yet, we all know that doesn’t always work out. We struggle with our impulses and willpower. We break our New Year’s resolutions as soon as we set them. We say one thing, then find ourselves doing another. This is true of individuals, but also for teams, communities, and organizations. Why does this happen, and what can we do about it?</p>



<p>Intentions are an important part of what makes us human. All sorts of animals set goals and make plans, but they’re usually very basic, short-term intentions, like “I’m gonna eat that bug.” In most species, lifestyle is largely innate, defined by genetics and the environment with only limited flexibility. Humans are different in that we <em>design</em> our lifestyles, both as individuals and as a society. We set abstract, long-term intentions like “I’m gonna save up for college” or “all people in this company should have equal opportunity.” These ambitious visions can help us imagine possible futures, and guide us to make them a reality.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to set good intentions and stop there. Sometimes that&#8217;s enough, but often it’s not. Those delayed goals can be tricky for our animal minds, after all. I meant to pick up eggs on my way home, but I forgot. I know I ought to make a healthy dinner, but I’m exhausted, so I’ll order pizza. I said I’d learn Japanese, but maybe I was just kidding myself. I wanted to build a shed in the backyard, but I didn’t really know how, so it never got started. When one of my female engineers at work was criticized unfairly, I thought I was being supportive when I swooped in to defend her. When she pointed out how I was preventing her from proving herself, I had to unlearn that habit. In each of these cases, I meant well, yet I fell short.</p>



<p>This highlights some of the key problems with intentions. They aren’t rules that the brain enforces. If I keep my intentions in mind, I might notice when they should affect my decisions, and act accordingly. Or I might <em>not</em>. Like all people, I spend a lot of time on auto-pilot. I often get tired or distracted. I make countless choices in a day I’m not even aware of. Then there’s willpower. Just because I know I <em>ought</em> to do the right thing, doesn’t mean I <em>will</em> after a long and frustrating day. Lastly, intentions don’t come with step-by-step instructions. It’s often not clear how to achieve my goals, so I have to think about the steps involved, what my options are, and what outcomes are likely. Even if I do everything right, reality doesn’t always play along. I have to watch to make sure things turn out the way I intended, and respond when they don’t.</p>



<p>At their best, intentions serve as a frame for thinking and planning. They’re a first step in a process that leads to an outcome. To improve the chances of success, I must design that process. I must compensate for my cognitive blind spots and mitigate the risk of accidents and surprises. This is a form of self-programming. What can I do now to shape my future behavior? How do I make sure I get into the right situations and avoid the wrong ones? How will I notice when that happens? Can I prepare so that I know what to do in the moment, and have everything I need to act? How will I know if my plan is working, and change course if I need to?</p>



<p>I’ve found there are two essential tools for this sort of planning:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Write and revisit.</strong> Intentions are often too vague to be useful. They can be easy to forget, and can drift over time without our notice. To remedy this, I write my intentions down. When possible, I share them with others to make sure I’m rigorous about it, and to create a sense of accountability. Then I set a reminder to revisit those intentions in a few weeks or months. I try to be brutally honest with myself. Am I living up to my expectations? Do I still think about the problem in the same way? If not, I try not to feel guilty, but instead focus on what to do about it. What’s wrong? Should I change my behavior? My intentions? Both? I force myself to think about this.</li>



<li><strong>Prepare yourself.</strong> When I set intentions, I think through how to achieve them. Not in full detail, but at least I’ll identify a few major sub-goals that are essential for success. I think about when and how I might do those things, and create some structure around that to make it real. I write TODO lists and set time aside for specific tasks. I leave notes or physical reminders in the real world to nudge me at crucial moments. I think about what decisions I&#8217;ll have to make, and how to make them. This is a way of front-loading the effort, doing the thinking and willpower work when I have time for it. That way, when the crucial moment comes, my actions can be fully automatic.</li>
</ul>



<p>Critically, these two things go hand in hand. Writing down my intentions doesn&#8217;t help much if I don’t take some action to ensure they happen. Similarly, making a plan and following it rigorously can be a disaster if it’s the wrong goal, the wrong plan, or if the situation changes. The benefit comes from cycling through these two modes of thinking regularly. What should I do? How should I do it? Is it working? What should I do next?</p>



<p>The same problems appear in teams, communities, and organizations, often amplified dramatically. Aligning intentions across many people is very hard, and aligning behaviors is impossible. Each person has their own motivations, and is gifted and fallible in their own unique ways. To be fully effective, they must set their own intentions, and find their own ways to reliably achieve them. Many leaders are good at setting intentions for their groups, but struggle to make them happen. Sometimes they just say what they want to accomplish and assume everyone gets it and will (somehow) make it happen without any guidance or coordination. Other times they micromanage, trying to force people to deliver by robbing them of their autonomy.</p>



<p>I lead others the same way I lead myself. I just apply the concepts at different levels of abstraction. As a leader, my main responsibility is to keep intentions fresh in my team’s minds and to encourage each individual to be productive in their own way. Rather than telling people what to do and how to do it, I make sure my team has policies and tools to help with common challenges. This gives them freedom and flexibility, but also reduces their burden in the moment and encourages consistency. I create timelines, schedule check-ins, and set reminders in the right time and place. I often don&#8217;t care about the timing, I just want to give folks a nudge when they need it, and encourage them to prioritize, pace themselves, and track their own progress. Every quarter, we revisit our intentions together and try to think: are these still the right goals? Is our approach working? Is there a better way?</p>



<p>What makes humans so remarkable is our flexibility. We work creatively within constraints, figuring out the details as we go along. Intentions are a powerful tool for doing that, but they’re just part of the story. Acting intentionally, either as a person or as a group, is about creating the conditions for success. It’s not enough to want something. We’re just animals, after all. We can’t see the future, we can’t be “on” all the time, and it’s very easy to get distracted or to deceive ourselves. If we embrace our limitations, we can try to work around them and do better. Or, at least we can forgive ourselves more easily when we inevitably let that New Year&#8217;s resolution slip.</p>



<p>What do you think? Have you sometimes struggled to live up to your own intentions? Do you have any advice for how to overcome that? What about in the work setting? Have you noticed any practices that make a team / company better or worse at living up to their own ideals? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>Emotions are a challenging topic. I’ve spent years learning to recognize and manage my own emotions in a productive way. I’ve also done a lot of reading, learning from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral biology how emotions work on a theoretical and practical level. That’s useful, but the actual experience of emotions and how they shape our minds, our well-being, and our lives is incredibly subtle and complicated. I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand it, but I find it fascinating because emotions serve as a sort of interface between two different kinds of human intelligence: the body and the mind.</p>



<p>I like to think of the body as an autonomous robot. It does its best to survive, sustain itself, and react appropriately to whatever&#8217;s happening, recruiting the mind to understand the world and make wise decisions. That robot has evolved many different modes of behavior, each suited to particular needs, problems, and contexts. One of the main challenges for controlling the body, then, is choosing which state to be in right now. Should I look for food? Flirt with a potential mate? Take shelter and conserve my energy? Run for my life? Being successful means constantly monitoring my situation, dynamically switching from state to state, to make sure my behaviors fit the moment.</p>



<p>In human beings, there are tons of these “states,” but they’re hard to count since they’re so multi-dimensional and blurred at the edges. Some of the most notable ones are the core emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger), but others are directly tied to the body’s function, like hunger, arousal, and fatigue. The state of the body is decided by a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters in the bloodstream, which coordinate activity across all the organ systems. They evolved before the brain, which is why the mind has only an indirect awareness of them. It experiences them as “feelings,” often by interpreting subtle and ambiguous signals like a flush of heat, a stirring in the guts, or a racing pulse.</p>



<p>That said, the brain plays a crucial role in emotions. The mind interprets what’s going on in the world to help trigger the right emotions, and emotions reconfigure the brain to serve in whatever activity the body is doing. Those chemicals in my bloodstream tune parts of my brain to be more or less active, reshaping my perception, judgment, and impulses. They shift my patterns of thought and behavior dramatically, whether I like it or not. When I’m angry, I’m more likely to perceive someone as a threat. I’m less likely to stop and think, and more likely to lash out. Looking back at the situation later with a clear head (that is, one that’s not flooded with neurotransmitters), I might see things very differently. That’s part of why recognizing emotions is so hard. Noticing and understanding are cognitive processes, happening inside my mind, while it’s being warped or even impaired by those emotions.</p>



<p>Another important factor at play here is how <em>non-linear</em> brains are. They’re collections of many different special-purpose sub-networks. These all work together in concert, combining their efforts, calling on each other, and riffing off each other to produce my stream of consciousness. This is an extremely powerful tool for creative thinking, quick intuitive action, and using metaphor to recall relevant experiences from the past. The flip side is that causality becomes very muddled. Ideas flow into one another in a sort of free-associative cascade, often forming self-reinforcing cycles. Every thought in my head is simultaneously cause <em>and</em> effect.</p>



<p>All these brain networks, ideas, and memories are linked together by associations, which cause them to resonate with each other and activate at the same time. These associations are often based on similarity or relevance, but emotions make some of the strongest and most common links. Most thoughts have emotional significance, and thinking those thoughts will evoke the associated feelings. Similarly, feelings evoke associated thoughts. More subtly, emotions also change my sense of salience. When I’m mad, I’m more likely to <em>notice</em> and fixate on thoughts and observations that resonate with that feeling of anger, while others get ignored.</p>



<p>This explains why it’s so hard to identify <em>why</em> I’m feeling an emotion. As a human being, I have a body evolved to react to immediate threats and opportunities, and a mind that spends much of its time thinking about abstract concepts, world events, and possible futures. This makes it very easy to misattribute my emotions. When I notice a feeling, I tend to associate it with whatever I was thinking or experiencing at that moment. This is often wrong, and that can cause problems.</p>



<p>A perfect example is displaced aggression. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, I was suddenly faced with many intense emotions, like anger, sadness, and fear. I carried these with me all the time, but there was little I could do to help, so I tried not to dwell on them. Nonetheless, I was much more irritable than usual. It was like my personality changed, and in a sense, it really did. I’d overreact to small slights and setbacks. I was more critical, aggressive, and impatient. I’d fixate on some insignificant detail from an email or meeting to the point where I’d be fuming  about it when I got home. I managed to stay professional and respectful at work, but it took a real effort to do so.</p>



<p>It’s worth emphasizing how harmful misattributing emotions can be. When I’m mad, anyone who crosses my path may stir that anger just by chance, tempting me to lash out. This means the people I interact with most—my coworkers, family, and friends—are the ones most at risk. There’s also the harm done to myself. When my dad was sick, I managed not to worry about that all the time, but mostly by worrying about <em>other</em> things instead. The distractions were easier to face, but also emotional and not really more productive. They did nothing to relieve my stress and irritability, which lingered on until I faced the root cause and processed those emotions.</p>



<p>Understanding all this has led me to a practice that I find works really well. Sometimes an idea or an experience gets me suddenly riled up and emotional. Often it’s something small and petty, or something grand and abstract, both good signs that the emotion is an overreaction. Whatever thought I’m having stirs up strong feelings, which in turn drives me to obsess more on the thought in an escalating cycle. I find myself ranting or ruminating. When I notice that happening, I try to calm myself down, get some exercise, and take a break to let the neurotransmitters dissipate so I can think clearly. Then, I can use the following technique.</p>



<p>I set aside the idea that bothered me, and instead I focus on the feelings that idea stirs up. I sit with them for a moment, and then I look at what <em>other</em> ideas resonate with them. Usually, there are several. Some are big, some small. Some are immediate and concrete, some distant and abstract. Often there’s one that stands out among all the others as the most salient, and it isn’t necessarily the idea I started with. That’s when I think, “Oh! So <em>that’s</em> what this is really about.” In other cases, I find lots of little things, unrelated, but piling on all at once. This helps me realize there’s no one cause for how I’m feeling right now, and it’s not fair or useful to blame a scapegoat for my generally bad day.</p>



<p>Emotions are a critical part of how the mind works. They define human values, shape our activities, and motivate everything we do. I hope reflecting on my own experience helps illuminate that. How does it resonate with you? Is your experience similar or different? Have you noticed other quirks about your emotions, your thoughts, and how they interact? Computers are generally emotionless, but a few chat bots simulate human-like emotion, and some agent-based AIs have their own system of states and “feelings,” suited to their artificial task and environment. How do you feel about emotional AIs?  I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I spend a lot of time in my own head. I’m a planner and a bit of a perfectionist. Part of me would love to always be in control of my life and everything in it (while another part of me realizes that would be <em>disastrous</em>). So, it’s been unsettling to learn how much of what my mind does is because of outside factors, like the way my brain is built, the situation I’m in, and my experiences growing up. In another sense, though, it’s a relief. Recognizing that my mind is limited, quirky, not entirely in my control, and less flexible than I imagined has helped me to loosen my grip. It’s helped me to go with the flow, and to channel my mental energy in more productive ways.</p>



<p>One example of this is focus, or being “in the moment.” This is something I often struggle with. My mind is hyperactive. It’s always chewing on something, which can be incredibly distracting. Worse yet, my mind is often obsessing over unhelpful things. I worry about that awkward disagreement I had with my coworker. What were they thinking? Is this going to be an ongoing problem between us? Or perhaps second-guessing myself. Was that email I sent too hostile? Did I remember to cross off the last TODO before submitting my work? These thoughts come unbidden when I should be paying attention to this meeting, the road, or my yoga class. I feel like I’m being neurotic and too harsh on myself, but worse: I’m <em>not</em> doing the thing I meant to do. I’ve lost control.</p>



<p>What’s going on here? Why do I think what I think? Sometimes I choose to direct my thoughts. Sometimes a trigger in my environment does it for me. Very often, though, my mind is just “wandering.” But what does that mean? MRI studies have taught us a lot, actually. When the mind is idling, there are a few specific brain regions that activate in a distinctive pattern, which is generally consistent across people and cultures. From the inside, it feels like the mind cycles through a few common modes of thought, checking which ones have something to say right now. Sometimes ideas come and go, and sometimes I get sucked into one and lose myself in rumination. It’s a bit like flipping through TV channels to see what’s on. Neuroscientists call this the Default Mode Network, or DMN. It’s part of how the brain is built–part of our human programming. When our minds are idle, performing some rote activity, or unable to hold focus, “wandering” is just what they do.</p>



<p>I came to understand the DMN much more clearly when I realized its connection with meditation. For many years, I thought I sucked at meditation. Like many people, I found it difficult to sit in stillness and think of nothing. It seemed ridiculous to devote hours to this practice just so I could… clear my mind? What’s the point of that? My perspective changed when I got into yoga. Rather than doing nothing, I was doing <em>something</em>: moving, balancing, breathing, paying close attention to my body. Rather than clearing my mind, I practiced feeling the subtle, reciprocal interactions between body and mind. I could see it improve my mood, my health, and my posture, so the value was clear. I also found it to be much easier for me than other forms of meditation (though still challenging, especially once the poses became familiar).</p>



<p>My teachers explained that we all have a “monkey mind,” with a short attention span and a penchant to worry. It’s obsessed with desires, relationships, and critiques. It worries about the past and the present. This isn’t <em>bad</em>, it’s merely human. We can’t just stop doing it, and that’s totally fine. That isn’t the purpose of meditation. Most of the practice is to watch and learn. As I did that, I recognized the connection with neuroscience. The “monkey mind” is just another name for the DMN, and meditation is a way to study it. When does it kick in? What does that feel like? Where does my mind tend to go when it wanders? How can I notice when a thought is off topic? What is it like for that thought to persist, expand, and fill my mind? Can I notice that happening, intervene, and dismiss the thought before it fully blossoms?</p>



<p>In some meditative traditions, the explicit goal is to completely clear the mind and dwell in stillness. That’s totally possible, but it takes years of devoted practice, and it’s definitely <em>not</em> my goal. I see the DMN as pretty useful, actually. It’s nature’s way of ensuring that I reflect on the things going on in my life, the health of my relationships, my plans for the future, and the quality of my work and decisions. My brain automatically notices when it’s under-utilized, and finds ways to fill that space with something which might be useful. I often enjoy it, and it’s often productive. The only problem is when I spend too much time ruminating, or when the thoughts turn toxic, fixating on my faults, wild speculations, and things I cannot change. I want to avoid that, and mindfulness helps me do so.</p>



<p>I used to identify very strongly with my mind. My thoughts were all I had. They were <em>me</em>. I believed that every thought was an important expression of myself, and that I <em>had</em> to listen because the thoughts were in control. It almost seemed like, if my mind went quiet, I would cease to exist. For me, the value of meditation was in shaking off this mindset. I am not my mind. I <em>have</em> a mind. It feels good to merely exist in my body, with no thoughts at all, even if that rarely happens. When my DMN stirs up thoughts, I needn’t attend to them if I don’t want to. That constant churn of semi-random ideas is how my brain provides the raw materials of thought. Sometimes it’s important or insightful, but often it’s just noise. I find it useful to check in now and again: what am I thinking? Does it serve me right now? If not, can I let it go? If the thought is too stubborn, perhaps I should act on it. Is there something I could do right now to quickly resolve it and move on?</p>



<p>What do you think? Does my experience resonate with you? How do you feel about going on autopilot, and having your mind wander? Do you resist it or embrace it? Does it do more good or harm? Are there other aspects of how the mind works that you’d like me to explore on this blog? Let me know in the comments.</p>
