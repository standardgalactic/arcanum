<p>(Featured image is a photo I took of a hazy city skyline in Seoul, South Korea)</p>



<p>People love to speculate about what sets us apart from other species. We’d like to think if we put a human side by side with any other animal, we’d be smarter, more capable, and dominant. If we’re being honest, though, individual humans aren’t that impressive. Our big brains only make a difference when we gather in groups. It’s the <em>collective</em> intelligence of humanity that changed the world, not the human animal. It’s less rational, less coherent, and harder to control. With modern science and technology, we’re beginning to understand this collective intelligence and how to shape it. But who shapes our culture, and to what ends? How as a society do we <em>want</em> to shape it? These are big questions, but first we need to understand what it means to be “the programmable species.”</p>



<p>Human beings are excellent at independent creative thinking. Yet, alone and without the tools of society, we’re actually pretty helpless. For instance, our big brains demand calorie-dense food, but our jaws are too weak to eat meat unless it’s thoroughly cooked. We can’t start a fire without physical tools (like flint and tinder) and mental tools (like knowing what a fire is for, that we can make one, and how to do that). Thus, to become fully human, we must be <em>programmed</em> with human culture. We depend on our community to shape us, give us tools to survive, teach us a lifestyle, and integrate us into a network of relationships that form a society.</p>



<p>We’re also capable of programming ourselves. That is, we can think strategically and make plans. We can invest in self-improvement, building our knowledge, skills, and relationships in order to achieve new goals. We invent tools that extend our abilities. This is extraordinary, but not unheard of. There are hints of this sort of intelligence in chimpanzees, elephants, crows, and many other species. They make tools, play politics, solve puzzles, and occasionally invent new lifestyles, but they don’t <em>collaborate</em> much. They may help each other, or use each other, but they almost never work “as a team.”</p>



<p>Humans, on the other hand, work together all the time. We form groups with a shared identity, purpose, and plan. We coordinate so that groups of almost any size can act as one much more powerful individual. This is rare in nature, but not unique. Colonial insects do it. What’s different with humans is how we spontaneously form and break these collectives on the fly. We don’t have to <em>evolve</em> new ways of collaborating. We can <em>imagine</em> them and share them with language. We continuously remake our culture, dynamically shifting goals and strategies as each individual nudges the collective in whatever direction they think is best.</p>



<p>This form of collective intelligence is incredibly powerful. It requires individuals who are intelligent, social, and good at communicating, so that’s what we evolved to be. We’re born craving social connection, stories, and gossip. We have powerful instincts to trust one another, to contribute, to be liked, and to fit in. The result is that whenever humans come together, we spontaneously form communities. Just by talking and telling stories, we build up a consensus about who we are, what we’re doing, and how to be together.</p>



<p>Language was a key innovation, but new communication technologies have made much larger collectives possible, with different forms and capacities. Broadcast media is one such technology worth a closer look. For most of our history, we could only coordinate as many people as we could gather and talk to (this is why the Romans built a vast network of coliseums, with paved roads and courier routes between them). The printing press changed that, making it relatively fast, cheap, and easy to reach hundreds or even millions of people. Radio and television only turbo-charged this capability.</p>



<p>The power of broadcast media comes from delivering the same message to everyone <em>at the same time</em>. Not only can it plant ideas in many minds, but it gets people <em>talking</em> about those ideas, iterating on them and integrating them into daily life. And we talk about them because we <em>care</em>. Our media, especially video, is designed to tap into our evolved need for knowledge and connection. We crave information. We see people in the media, and they become part of our extended social circles. We trust them, emulate them, and integrate their ideas with our own, usually without meaning to or even noticing that we’re doing this.</p>



<p>The problem is that the people on the screen <em>aren’t</em> our community. They don’t know us and we don’t know them. They’re usually personas or characters that don’t even <em>exist</em> in real life. We know this, yet our brains—evolved to be social—tend to embrace them as community members anyway. This illusion changes the way culture is formed. What used to be a more egalitarian, peer-to-peer process is now centralized. A few powerful individuals can put their ideas into the mouths of characters that stir the hearts and minds of many millions of people. Governments, corporations, social movements, and others work very hard to shape the thoughts and behavior of the whole population, and in some ways they are very successful.</p>



<p>Social media is a powerful new innovation, of course. Unlike broadcast media, where the same message goes out to everyone, social media makes it possible to shape every aspect of communication. The platform influences how people find each other and cluster into communities. The platform decides which voices and topics to amplify or stifle. The platform helps advertisers precisely target their audience, understand their biases and preferences, and craft messages with the biggest impact. They construct a customized media environment for each individual (a “filter bubble”) and attempt to monitor and influence each community and society as a whole.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that social media is <em>bad</em>. It’s an incredibly powerful tool for understanding and influencing human culture, and we <em>need</em> that to get through the many crises we’re facing. The question is, who gets to wield that power, and what is it used for? Today, we let big corporations design and control these platforms with minimal restraint. They shape human culture, which decides every aspect of our lives and the fate of the planet, primarily for the purpose of making money; the consequences for society and the world aren’t their concern. That seems deeply problematic, but how could we do it differently?</p>



<p>There are two main problems with the status quo: the goal is unhealthy, and power is too centralized. It would be nice if the purpose of social media was to make society better, rather than trying to make the most money. The main problem is, who gets to decide what’s “better”? There’s no one right answer. This is why new social media sites like Mastodon are focused on the second part of the problem. By breaking up big platforms into many small, independent, but interconnected pieces, they can make a huge and thriving network without any one individual holding too much power. The result is more chaotic and fragmented. Different groups shape their discourse as they please in a more bottom-up fashion. This doesn’t prevent exploitation or toxic communities, but at least it’s more egalitarian and human-centric.</p>



<p>What makes humans special is how we build collectives that adapt continuously. This made our species successful, so we evolved innate biases to socialize. Over time, we learned to exploit those biases to exert more control over society as a whole. People are lured to big media for entertainment and connection, but these days it often feels like the true purpose of these platforms is to manipulate us and extract value from our participation. This raises a big question we each need to answer for ourselves: how do we <em>want</em> to shape our culture, and who should wield that power?</p>



<p>I don’t have answers, but I hope this perspective is useful. It’s uncomfortable to think of myself as so persuadable that I can’t even watch YouTube without some of the ideals of the creators and the platform rubbing off on me, but it’s kinda true. I can try to resist that, but it takes a conscious effort which I rarely even think to put in. The truth is, our minds are designed by evolution to be porous and to integrate with each other. This makes us both powerful and vulnerable, so it’s worth thinking about! We ought to be mindful of what we expose ourselves to, and what ideas we let in.</p>



<p>What do you think? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>
