<p>Well, the third semester of my PhD is wrapping up! I really enjoyed my classes this time around. Evolutionary Computation was super interesting, and sparked all sorts of connections with my research. My class project was a big success, and I hope to turn it into a conference paper. I‚Äôll share more on that later, but here‚Äôs a <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn/113544231802797345">sneak peek</a> if you‚Äôre curious. Deep Learning was also pretty great, and I feel like I have a more deep and intuitive understanding of what‚Äôs actually going on when you train or interact with an AI. One of the more exciting / challenging topics we covered was Transformers, the new model architecture that powers ChatGPT and its ilk. In some sense, Transformers are quite simple, but they‚Äôre definitely not intuitive; understanding why they‚Äôre built the way they are, and why that works so well takes some effort. So, to help cement my understanding, I wrote a blog post about it, and you get a bonus episode for the holidays!</p>



<p>Over winter break I hope to develop my Evolutionary Computation class project into a full paper. In short, it&#8217;s a new kind of evolutionary algorithm, inspired by endosymbiosis, that works in surprising ways. So far I‚Äôve only used it to solve a trivial toy problem, so I‚Äôll probably also start work on a follow-up study, exploring what practical applications this new algorithm might be good for. And, of course, I‚Äôve got more research ideas to explore beyond that. I‚Äôm quite excited to try evolving a population without genomes, for instance. So many ideas! I hope I‚Äôll be able to keep a few projects running in parallel, balancing my time across them, and leaving room for me in between. I‚Äôll continue to share updates as I make progress.</p>



<p>In the spring, I‚Äôll delve even deeper into Deep Learning, with a class that explores counter-intuitive results and how surprisingly effective DL is sometimes. How is it even possible to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù using nothing but vector math? What are these models really doing, and why are some models better than others? Should be fun. I‚Äôll also be delving into the math of chaos and fractals. I hope that will be useful for my research into self-modifying dynamic systems (ie, simulated life <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="üòõ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), and lead to some very pretty visuals I can share. We‚Äôll see!</p>



<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll share the post about Transformers right after this, and that will wrap up another year of blog posts. More to come in January!</p>
