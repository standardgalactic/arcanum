<p>(This post&#8217;s image is a photo I took of my yoga gear. Specialized tools like my mat, blocks, and strap work together to make my practice possible. They extend my body, and help arrange it in the ways my mind imagines)</p>



<p>I was pretty sedentary as a kid, and didn’t get serious about physical fitness until I was an adult. One nice thing about that is I got to watch myself learn, knowing all I do now about the brain. By practicing yoga and working with physical therapists, I’ve learned a lot about myself, but also how mind and body work together. Mastering a new physical skill actually recruits at least <em>three</em> separate learning processes working together. Understanding this changed my expectations, helped me gain more control over my body, and made exercise much more enjoyable.</p>



<p>When I first started yoga, I was startled by how little I knew about my body. My teachers were asking me to observe and discern sensations I’d never noticed before. They asked me to get into certain poses, using certain muscle groups, and I didn’t know how! I didn’t have the names for these things. Worse, I could <em>see</em> what I was supposed to do, but I didn’t know how to make my body do that, or even if I could. It was frustrating.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s weird to think how ignorant we are of our bodies, given that we live in them our whole lives. For me, a prime example comes from physical therapy. When recovering from an injury, I relearned how to walk up stairs. I’ve climbed stairs thoughtlessly my whole life, and I never considered there were different ways to do it. But the leg is controlled by opposing muscle groups. I used to climb stairs by <em>lifting</em> each leg, using just the muscles on the front side. I learned to also use the muscles on the <em>back</em> side, to push up and straighten the leg. Either set of muscles can do the job alone. Now, I consciously try to balance the effort from both sides, but this never would have occurred to me without knowing a little anatomy.</p>



<p>That knowledge was game changing for me, but unfortunately knowing how the body works isn’t good enough. I can memorize anatomical diagrams, muscle names, and facts about body mechanics, but the only interface between the brain and body are the spinal nerves. How’s the brain supposed to know what nerve impulses correspond to which movements? There’s actually a region of the brain dedicated to this problem, <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/12/07/learning-to-move/">the cerebellum</a>, but it’s not consciously accessible. This is why yoga instructors use <em>cues</em>: they teach little mental tricks for recruiting muscles, and associate them with relevant postures.</p>



<p>Try this. Bend your elbows ninety degrees to extend your forearms out from your body, palms up. Imagine someone’s handing you a heavy platter. You might notice the trapezius and rhomboid muscles engage between your shoulders. These muscles largely serve a supportive role. For many people, they aren’t <em>needed</em> much in daily life, but using them can improve posture and reduce strain on other muscles. The problem is, they’re easy to ignore and hard to describe. But I can turn them on with the cue, and then I can learn what it <em>feels like</em> to use those muscles. Once I can tell whether they’re working, I can often activate them at will. Or, I can just use the cue, as needed.</p>



<p>Of course, conscious knowledge of form and cues are just step one. Muscle control is mostly <em>un</em>conscious, and for good reason. Remembering all the cues, monitoring my body, and continuously correcting my posture is <em>work</em>. It takes my full attention, leaving no room for anything else. Luckily, that’s just a phase. With enough practice, my cerebellum learns the patterns and can take over. I can hand off that work to my unconscious motion control sub-processor, freeing my conscious mind to think about something else.</p>



<p>This is why physical therapy can be so effective. After an injury, some muscles and joints may not perform like they used to. Some links between mind and body might even be severed or scrambled. Recovery means learning new ways to do old activities. At first, this is a nightmare. Without the support of the cerebellum, even just walking is an intensive conscious effort. Physical therapy can be a painful, tedious, and drawn-out process, but for many patients it makes a world of difference. It teaches the cerebellum new motion programs. Potentially, walking can become fully automatic again. The conscious mind can be used to retrain the unconscious mind in profound and lasting ways.</p>



<p>Yet knowing how to move isn’t enough if the body can’t follow through. The hardest part about learning a new physical activity is that the body usually isn’t ready for it. When I first started yoga, my muscles were weak, rigid, and lazy. They quickly became tired and sore, which just made me want to use them less. They struggled to move my body weight, and were so tight that my range of motion was limited. Some postures were hard, uncomfortable, or impossible. I couldn’t keep up, and when I pushed myself harder, I only injured myself.</p>



<p>That taught me a lesson about patience and acceptance. My body wasn’t ready, so I couldn’t do those poses, but I could work towards them. I learned to listen to my muscles complain, and to distinguish between different sensations. Some indicate hard limits I should not push past, but most are just signs of stress, and those can be <em>good</em>. When muscles, bones, and tendons get stressed, they respond by becoming bigger, stronger, and tougher in a process called anti-fragility. The discomfort I feel is just that physical learning process in action. By embracing the discomfort, I could slowly reshape my body.</p>



<p>Anti-fragility doesn’t involve the brain, conscious or unconscious. It’s a kind of learning that happens in the body tissues themselves. My muscles “know” whether they are getting the job done. They can tell if they are actually contracting and relaxing when they get the signal, whether that was easy or hard, and whether they sustained any damage in the attempt. They recognize how often they are put to use, and whether they are usually exhausted or ready for action.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, muscles conserve energy by doing as little as possible. But when I regularly demand more of them, they adapt. They become bigger, stronger, and more responsive. They consume more energy at rest so they’re always ready for action when I need them. They become less lazy, working harder by default, which makes them stronger still. This requires more protein to build the muscles, and more calories to power them. So my metabolism adapts, too. I eat more and my body burns more calories continuously, rather than storing them as fat.</p>



<p>What’s so fascinating is how all three ways of learning work together. With conscious thought, I choose to change my behavior. I master new facts and cues, so I know what I’m doing at an intellectual level, and can execute new skills (poorly, at first). With practice, not only do I refine those skills, but I engage an unconscious learning process that makes them fully automatic. I can focus my mind on the task I want to accomplish, and trust my body will just perform all the complex movements I need to pull it off. My muscles may not be up to the challenge at first, but that’s fine. With willpower, I push my tissues to their limits, and they learn to do what I ask. By the principle of anti-fragility, my body automatically remodels itself, increasing strength, flexibility, or stamina precisely where they’re needed. It makes itself a better robot, one that can live the lifestyle my mind consciously chooses. These three learning processes work independently, yet together they make a dynamic human being, one that can just as well become a yogi, a warrior, a marathon runner, or a weightlifter.</p>



<p>Intelligence isn’t just about brains, it’s about bodies, too, and about multiple intelligent systems working together in complex ways. I hope this was a helpful example, but as always I’m looking for feedback. Is this an experience you can relate to? Have you observed these different systems within yourself? Do you think it helps to know what’s going on intellectually, or do you approach physical training in a different way? Any other thoughts or observations to share? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>Most people identify their intelligence with their conscious mind. That’s the part that <em>knows</em> it’s intelligent. That’s the part that understands and makes decisions. But looking closely, there’s plenty of intelligent things we do below the conscious level. Perhaps the most striking example is movement. We use our bones and muscles continuously during our waking hours. We learn complex motor skills and perform them over and over again with great precision and reliability. Yet, we rarely think about <em>how</em> we do those things. It’s actually an under-appreciated superpower that helps us multitask, overcome injuries, and adapt to new opportunities over evolutionary time. How does that work, and what does it teach us about intelligence?</p>



<p>The human body is a large and complex machine. Over 200 bones give our bodies shape, support their bulk, and articulate through 400 joints. Over 600 muscles hold those bones together, move them relative to each other, and maintain position and posture. Unlike a building with a rigid, static structure, the body is like a floppy ragdoll. It can only hold a shape through the constant effort of its muscles. Imagine a team of circus workers, lifting a long tent pole by ropes tied to the top. They work together to overcome gravity, hoisting the heavy thing and keeping it in a precarious upright position. They carefully balance the forces from all directions, adjusting how hard they pull to keep the pole vertical, even compensating for the wind if necessary. Now imagine another tent pole balanced on top of that one. Then another, and another… it’s pretty amazing that the body can perform this feat at all.</p>



<p>And that’s just for standing still. Actually moving the body in useful ways is <em>much</em> more difficult. It requires the same coordination of many muscles, balancing and constantly adjusting their effort to hold a bone in position, but now the joints need to move. The body must choreograph, synchronize, and precision control dozens of muscles for even small, subtle movements. Thankfully, all of this is completely unconscious, because doing it manually would be a nightmare. To get a sense of this, check out the game <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>. It’s a stupid, frustrating game, but a good illustration of the problem. It’s much easier to unconsciously control the thirty-odd muscles in each hand to type those four letters than it is to consciously control the four simulated muscles that make the QWOP guy run.</p>



<p>How do we do it? The brain has a dedicated subprocessor for controlling the body. The largest part of the human brain is the cortex, home to our perception, comprehension, higher level thought, and decision making. It’s a sort of general purpose computer that works across many modalities. Below that are several special-purpose brain regions that serve as an interface to the body. They are “neural networks” by definition, but with highly specialized design and function very different from the cortex. One of these brain regions is the cerebellum, and its main job is to produce precisely timed sequences of nerve impulses to control the body. We aren’t conscious of what’s happening in the cerebellum because it’s actually much older than our conscious minds. Every vertebrate has one, going back hundreds of millions of years.</p>



<p>The key trick to the cerebellum’s function is a feedback loop. The cerebellum doesn’t just “move the body.” It can only get it right by constantly monitoring how the body and each muscle responds to its signals, noticing any deviations from the ideal, and then adjusting its signals to compensate. This is necessary, because the body has to perform in any position, even under the influence of outside forces, even when some muscles are stiff, weak, tired, or injured. There’s no fixed control program that can work in all of those circumstances, so the cerebellum must adapt in real time. This is also how it learns. Each error is a lesson for the future. With practice, the cerebellum gets better at predicting how the body will respond to its signals, the errors get smaller, and the necessary corrections become more subtle.</p>



<p>As an example, my cerebellum wasn’t born knowing how to do yoga. I had to learn by trial and error. When I first tried getting into those shapes, I did a pretty bad job of it. My form was sloppy, and “wrong” in many details. My balance was precarious. My motion was awkward and jerky. I overused some muscles and neglected others entirely. But my teachers pointed out what I did wrong, and I made corrections. By performing the same motions again and again, learning what the right posture feels like and what adjustments to make, I built up muscle memory. Now I can just think “warrior II” and my body delivers effortlessly. I taught my cerebellum a new motion control program, and now I can invoke that program at will.</p>



<p>The real value of this unconscious mastery is how it frees up my mind. For instance, when I walk a familiar path, it’s like turning on autopilot. While my cerebellum takes care of putting one foot in front of the other, my <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/07/06/mindfulness-and-the-default-mode-network/">default mode network</a> can reflect, imagine, and make plans. This is a powerful form of multitasking, but it’s not always desired. For instance, in my yoga practice, I pay close attention to what my body is doing, even though that’s no longer necessary to perform the poses. The result is increased awareness, precision, and control in my movements, both right now and in the future. Practice lets my cerebellum refine its programming and learn layers of nuance that increase my skill level, but only if I pay attention. In other words, mastering a movement gives me the freedom to turn my mind to other things, <em>or</em> to focus on the performance, resulting in better quality and learning. I can’t do both at the same time.</p>



<p>The ability to control large, complex bodies and to think about other things at the same is amazing, but the cerebellum’s <em>adaptability</em> is even more important. Although some vertebrates are born knowing how to walk or swim, we all learn new ways of moving. This is how we adapt and recover after an injury, whether it’s a twisted ankle or a lost limb. It’s also how many species are able to use tools. The cerebellum doesn’t have a fixed image of the body and its limits, it can learn to contract or expand that image as needed. This also means it can learn to operate whatever body it’s born into. Vertebrates have evolved a huge range of bodies which can swim, crawl, walk, dig, climb, or fly. Each new form started off as a “birth defect,” but thanks to the adaptive powers of the cerebellum, sometimes these were not fatal flaws, but opportunities to explore new ways of living.</p>



<p>This is just one example of how our unconscious intelligence improves our daily lives <em>and</em> our ability to adapt over evolutionary time. This one happens to be part of the brain, but not the mind as we usually think of it. How does this fit with your experience? What’s it like coordinating the conscious and unconscious parts of your brain? If you’re into athletics, how do you think about training your mind as well as your body? Does this raise any more questions for you about how we think and move? If so, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(featuring an illustration by <a href="https://www.sarinamitchel.com/">Sarina Mitchel</a>)</p>



<p>Big brains are essential to our success as a species. That&#8217;s how we dominated this planet, so we tend look there to understand the secrets of intelligence. Yet, this perspective blinds us to other species’ achievements. Take plants, for instance. They don’t have brains at all, yet they make up over 82% of Earth’s biomass (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/total-biomass-weight-species-earth#:~:text=The%20total%20biomass%20on%20planet,of%20all%20biomass%20on%20Earth.">source</a>). They range in size from single celled algae to the largest organism on earth (learn about Pando <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC8abuKnr90">here</a>). Many of our greatest discoveries in chemistry, medicine, and material science amount to finding some plant that already solved a problem better than we could. Yet, we tend to see them as material resources rather than intelligent living beings. I suspect we underestimate plants because, from a certain perspective, they don’t do very much. They just sit there, letting food and water come to them. What’s so smart about that?</p>



<p>This perspective says more about human impatience than anything else. Plants can climb and tunnel and build. They search their environment for resources, relocate to prime spots, and wrestle with each other for access. They capture prey, hide from predators, and actively defend themselves from attackers. They can transform themselves dramatically, switching between totally different strategies depending on time of day, time of year, and environmental conditions. Plants are very active. It’s just on a different time scale than we’re used to. Plant movement is most obvious over hours, days, and years, though in some cases they move dramatically in just seconds.</p>



<p>Brains allow us to move quickly, which gives us a big advantage over plants, but I don’t think it makes us “more intelligent.” It’s better to say we found different strategies, specializing in different kinds of intelligence. Plants are slow and stationary because that’s <em>energy efficient</em>. It allows them to thrive in otherwise barren environments. Animals can’t do this. We all depend on plants for survival. Our extravagant, free-moving lifestyle is only possible because plants do the slow, hard work of capturing energy and nutrients from the air and soil, making concentrated fuel for our activity. Plants don’t <em>need</em> brains to live the way they do, and they don&#8217;t let that stop them from adopting all sorts of complex behaviors and lifestyles.</p>



<p>This is possible in part because plants often root themselves to the ground. That may seem like a poor choice, since it limits their options dramatically. They have to commit to one environment for their whole lives. Either that spot provides what they need, or it doesn&#8217;t and they&#8217;re doomed to die there. But there’s a major upside to this strategy: their lives are much more predictable than ours. This makes it possible for evolution to carefully plan responses to just about every threat or opportunity a plant might encounter in its lifetime. This is a different kind of intelligence than what we’re used to, one focused on exquisite design and finely crafted behavioral scripts, rather than spontaneity. Plants do respond in the moment, though, and even rooted to the ground they can be surprisingly mobile.</p>



<p>The most common and obvious way that plants move is through growth. Animals can’t really move until they’ve grown a body, but plants move by growing. They use their senses to track and follow the sun, water, and chemical nutrients they depend on. They feel the pull of gravity, the strain caused by the wind, and physical touch along their bodies. They change their shape by growing cells larger, faster, or in thicker layers on this side, but not that side. This allows them to reinforce themselves and stay upright, grope and crawl around obstacles to reach food, navigate wide open spaces with roots or runners, or wrap around trellises to pull themselves toward the sun.</p>



<p>Plants can also move by shifting water around their bodies in a process known as turgor. Cells with more water swell, while those with less shrink. By shifting water between cells in its stalk, a sunflower can rotate throughout the day to track the arc of the sun. Morning glories and lotuses use similar methods to hide and protect their delicate flowers at night, then unfurl them into extravagant displays to attract pollinators during the daytime. Although turgor is much slower than muscle contraction, it’s still fast enough to react to animals. The touch-me-not mimosa, sundew, and venus fly trap all move quickly in response to physical touch. A few species, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaTOoVmg1Q">hairy bittercress</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBg0In8Dtw">squirting cucumber</a>, are much more dramatic. They build up pressure behind a catch mechanism, then suddenly launch their seeds into the air with explosive force.</p>



<p>Plants are also masters of using weather and animals to help them move. Plants have evolved specialized seeds that travel great distances, allowing whole populations of plants to migrate and colonize new territory. You’ve probably encountered helicopter seeds that gracefully twirl through the air, dandelion seeds that ride the wind on floofy parasols, and burrs that hitch a ride on your pant leg. The energy for this motion doesn’t come from the plant itself, so should that even count? As an engineer, that sort of practical laziness just makes the design more impressive to me. The plant doesn’t bother capturing and reshaping energy for this, because it doesn’t have to. All it has to do is build the seed in the right shape and “let go” at the right moment.</p>



<p>What does all this tell us about intelligence? For one thing, life doesn’t need a brain to navigate obstacles, seek out resources, climb, glide, follow a daily routine, catch prey, or even launch projectiles. Plants are full of amazing behaviors that are completely mindless, yet elegant, successful, and highly optimized. We&#8217;ll never understand those behaviors by studying brains or Deep Learning algorithms, but they tell us a lot about ourselves. Our brains do not <em>replace</em> the kind of embodied intelligence we see so clearly in plants, they merely <em>extend</em> it. We depend very much on the same evolutionary design and “script-making” that governs the plant kingdom. Under the hood, much of what makes us intelligent comes down to the cells of our bodies, dynamically shifting chemical concentrations and patterns of growth, very much like plants do.</p>



<p>I hope to share several more posts about plants and fungi in the future, because there really is a lot to say. If you’re interested in going deeper on the topic of plant intelligence, I highly recommend the 1996 film <em>Microcosmos</em>. It explores the plants and tiny creatures in a meadow with some extraordinary macro and time-lapse photography. No other movie has given me a more vivid and profound sense of awe at how <em>alive</em> the world is, at every scale. Sadly, the streaming options are limited right now, but it’s worth it if you can get your hands on it.</p>



<p>As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What are your favorite examples of plants being amazing? Are there other kinds of “mindless intelligence” you’d like to see me write about? How do you think about the intelligence of plants and animals? How are they similar and how are they different? Let me know in the comments.</p>
