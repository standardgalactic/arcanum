<p>One thing that fascinates me about life on Earth is that it’s all built with proteins and genetics. Every living cell, even the most primitive microbe, has at its core a universal molecular-scale 3D printer, controlled by an evolved programming language, which gets read and error-corrected from a highly stable gigabit-scale molecular data storage medium (DNA).</p>



<p>In short, every living thing, every single cell, is a mechanism of astonishing complexity and sophistication, and they <em>all</em> share a common design. That’s wild. Life could not have started that way. The very first cells <em>must</em> have been much simpler and then evolved to be like this. But then… where are they? What happened to those pre-genetic cells? We’ve never found them. There are a few good answers to why, and I find them all fascinating.</p>



<p>One interesting possibility is that pre-genetic life is long gone. After all, it originated billions of years ago! Earth is a hostile place, and those early life forms must have been even more fragile than the ones we see today. Not to mention, there’s nothing life likes more than to <em>eat</em> other life. If “modern” cells with genetics outperformed their more primitive cousins, maybe they drove them extinct and replaced them?</p>



<p>Or, perhaps pre-genetic life never existed on this planet at all. Maybe the mechanism of genetics is so complex it needs much more time to evolve from scratch. Maybe the process got started elsewhere in the universe, and then got deposited here in cosmic debris. In that case, genetic cells just <em>colonized</em> Earth and adapted to living here. That’s an exciting possibility, because that might mean there’s more life “out there,” and we could find other living planets like our own.</p>



<p>Just as fascinating is the idea that pre-genetic life is still alive and well on this planet. That universal 3D printer for proteins is an incredibly powerful tool for cells, but its primary value is exploration. It makes it possible to invent new molecules and thus new lifestyles. It enables life to spread, complexify, and settle every corner of this planet.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t make the cell any better at living <em>one particular</em> lifestyle. It may be that cells evolved diversity to escape the dominance of the first life forms, that cornered their particular niche so well that finding a new niche was the only option. Perhaps genetics was invented to escape and branch out from this overcrowded primordial environment. If that’s the case, then maybe there’s a thriving colony of pre-genetic life, still clinging to a hydro-thermal vent somewhere, just as it has for billions of years. It’s terribly unlikely, but in theory, we could find it. How exciting would that be?</p>



<p>But what if pre-genetic life isn’t rare at all? What if we just can’t see it? Certainly, if it exists, it would be microscopic, and that already makes it very difficult to find and study. We’ve been cataloging single-celled organisms for centuries now, yet we’ve observed just a tiny fraction of them, and gene sequenced even fewer.</p>



<p>Maybe we overlook pre-genetic life because it looks like “normal” cells? We can now take a census of whole microbial communities by sequencing their DNA in bulk and using a computer to sort out the different species, but pre-genetic life would be invisible to that technique. It has no DNA to catalog. Maybe it uses RNA, which degrades more quickly, and is harder to study? Maybe the RNA is organized differently, in ways that would defy current sequencing technology? Maybe it uses a completely different mechanism, with molecules we don’t even know to look for? It’s fascinating to think there could be a whole other kingdom of life hiding in plain sight.</p>
