<p>Big brains are essential to our success as a species. That&#8217;s how we dominated this planet, so we tend look there to understand the secrets of intelligence. Yet, this perspective blinds us to other species’ achievements. Take plants, for instance. They don’t have brains at all, yet they make up over 82% of Earth’s biomass (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/total-biomass-weight-species-earth#:~:text=The%20total%20biomass%20on%20planet,of%20all%20biomass%20on%20Earth.">source</a>). They range in size from single celled algae to the largest organism on earth (learn about Pando <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC8abuKnr90">here</a>). Many of our greatest discoveries in chemistry, medicine, and material science amount to finding some plant that already solved a problem better than we could. Yet, we tend to see them as material resources rather than intelligent living beings. I suspect we underestimate plants because, from a certain perspective, they don’t do very much. They just sit there, letting food and water come to them. What’s so smart about that?</p>



<p>This perspective says more about human impatience than anything else. Plants can climb and tunnel and build. They search their environment for resources, relocate to prime spots, and wrestle with each other for access. They capture prey, hide from predators, and actively defend themselves from attackers. They can transform themselves dramatically, switching between totally different strategies depending on time of day, time of year, and environmental conditions. Plants are very active. It’s just on a different time scale than we’re used to. Plant movement is most obvious over hours, days, and years, though in some cases they move dramatically in just seconds.</p>



<p>Brains allow us to move quickly, which gives us a big advantage over plants, but I don’t think it makes us “more intelligent.” It’s better to say we found different strategies, specializing in different kinds of intelligence. Plants are slow and stationary because that’s <em>energy efficient</em>. It allows them to thrive in otherwise barren environments. Animals can’t do this. We all depend on plants for survival. Our extravagant, free-moving lifestyle is only possible because plants do the slow, hard work of capturing energy and nutrients from the air and soil, making concentrated fuel for our activity. Plants don’t <em>need</em> brains to live the way they do, and they don&#8217;t let that stop them from adopting all sorts of complex behaviors and lifestyles.</p>



<p>This is possible in part because plants often root themselves to the ground. That may seem like a poor choice, since it limits their options dramatically. They have to commit to one environment for their whole lives. Either that spot provides what they need, or it doesn&#8217;t and they&#8217;re doomed to die there. But there’s a major upside to this strategy: their lives are much more predictable than ours. This makes it possible for evolution to carefully plan responses to just about every threat or opportunity a plant might encounter in its lifetime. This is a different kind of intelligence than what we’re used to, one focused on exquisite design and finely crafted behavioral scripts, rather than spontaneity. Plants do respond in the moment, though, and even rooted to the ground they can be surprisingly mobile.</p>



<p>The most common and obvious way that plants move is through growth. Animals can’t really move until they’ve grown a body, but plants move by growing. They use their senses to track and follow the sun, water, and chemical nutrients they depend on. They feel the pull of gravity, the strain caused by the wind, and physical touch along their bodies. They change their shape by growing cells larger, faster, or in thicker layers on this side, but not that side. This allows them to reinforce themselves and stay upright, grope and crawl around obstacles to reach food, navigate wide open spaces with roots or runners, or wrap around trellises to pull themselves toward the sun.</p>



<p>Plants can also move by shifting water around their bodies in a process known as turgor. Cells with more water swell, while those with less shrink. By shifting water between cells in its stalk, a sunflower can rotate throughout the day to track the arc of the sun. Morning glories and lotuses use similar methods to hide and protect their delicate flowers at night, then unfurl them into extravagant displays to attract pollinators during the daytime. Although turgor is much slower than muscle contraction, it’s still fast enough to react to animals. The touch-me-not mimosa, sundew, and venus fly trap all move quickly in response to physical touch. A few species, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaTOoVmg1Q">hairy bittercress</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBg0In8Dtw">squirting cucumber</a>, are much more dramatic. They build up pressure behind a catch mechanism, then suddenly launch their seeds into the air with explosive force.</p>



<p>Plants are also masters of using weather and animals to help them move. Plants have evolved specialized seeds that travel great distances, allowing whole populations of plants to migrate and colonize new territory. You’ve probably encountered helicopter seeds that gracefully twirl through the air, dandelion seeds that ride the wind on floofy parasols, and burrs that hitch a ride on your pant leg. The energy for this motion doesn’t come from the plant itself, so should that even count? As an engineer, that sort of practical laziness just makes the design more impressive to me. The plant doesn’t bother capturing and reshaping energy for this, because it doesn’t have to. All it has to do is build the seed in the right shape and “let go” at the right moment.</p>



<p>What does all this tell us about intelligence? For one thing, life doesn’t need a brain to navigate obstacles, seek out resources, climb, glide, follow a daily routine, catch prey, or even launch projectiles. Plants are full of amazing behaviors that are completely mindless, yet elegant, successful, and highly optimized. We&#8217;ll never understand those behaviors by studying brains or Deep Learning algorithms, but they tell us a lot about ourselves. Our brains do not <em>replace</em> the kind of embodied intelligence we see so clearly in plants, they merely <em>extend</em> it. We depend very much on the same evolutionary design and “script-making” that governs the plant kingdom. Under the hood, much of what makes us intelligent comes down to the cells of our bodies, dynamically shifting chemical concentrations and patterns of growth, very much like plants do.</p>



<p>I hope to share several more posts about plants and fungi in the future, because there really is a lot to say. If you’re interested in going deeper on the topic of plant intelligence, I highly recommend the 1996 film <em>Microcosmos</em>. It explores the plants and tiny creatures in a meadow with some extraordinary macro and time-lapse photography. No other movie has given me a more vivid and profound sense of awe at how <em>alive</em> the world is, at every scale. Sadly, the streaming options are limited right now, but it’s worth it if you can get your hands on it.</p>



<p>As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What are your favorite examples of plants being amazing? Are there other kinds of “mindless intelligence” you’d like to see me write about? How do you think about the intelligence of plants and animals? How are they similar and how are they different? Let me know in the comments.</p>
