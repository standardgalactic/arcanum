<p>One thing that fascinates me about life on Earth is that it’s all built with proteins and genetics. Every living cell, even the most primitive microbe, has at its core a universal molecular-scale 3D printer, controlled by an evolved programming language, which gets read and error-corrected from a highly stable gigabit-scale molecular data storage medium (DNA).</p>



<p>In short, every living thing, every single cell, is a mechanism of astonishing complexity and sophistication, and they <em>all</em> share a common design. That’s wild. Life could not have started that way. The very first cells <em>must</em> have been much simpler and then evolved to be like this. But then… where are they? What happened to those pre-genetic cells? We’ve never found them. There are a few good answers to why, and I find them all fascinating.</p>



<p>One interesting possibility is that pre-genetic life is long gone. After all, it originated billions of years ago! Earth is a hostile place, and those early life forms must have been even more fragile than the ones we see today. Not to mention, there’s nothing life likes more than to <em>eat</em> other life. If “modern” cells with genetics outperformed their more primitive cousins, maybe they drove them extinct and replaced them?</p>



<p>Or, perhaps pre-genetic life never existed on this planet at all. Maybe the mechanism of genetics is so complex it needs much more time to evolve from scratch. Maybe the process got started elsewhere in the universe, and then got deposited here in cosmic debris. In that case, genetic cells just <em>colonized</em> Earth and adapted to living here. That’s an exciting possibility, because that might mean there’s more life “out there,” and we could find other living planets like our own.</p>



<p>Just as fascinating is the idea that pre-genetic life is still alive and well on this planet. That universal 3D printer for proteins is an incredibly powerful tool for cells, but its primary value is exploration. It makes it possible to invent new molecules and thus new lifestyles. It enables life to spread, complexify, and settle every corner of this planet.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t make the cell any better at living <em>one particular</em> lifestyle. It may be that cells evolved diversity to escape the dominance of the first life forms, that cornered their particular niche so well that finding a new niche was the only option. Perhaps genetics was invented to escape and branch out from this overcrowded primordial environment. If that’s the case, then maybe there’s a thriving colony of pre-genetic life, still clinging to a hydro-thermal vent somewhere, just as it has for billions of years. It’s terribly unlikely, but in theory, we could find it. How exciting would that be?</p>



<p>But what if pre-genetic life isn’t rare at all? What if we just can’t see it? Certainly, if it exists, it would be microscopic, and that already makes it very difficult to find and study. We’ve been cataloging single-celled organisms for centuries now, yet we’ve observed just a tiny fraction of them, and gene sequenced even fewer.</p>



<p>Maybe we overlook pre-genetic life because it looks like “normal” cells? We can now take a census of whole microbial communities by sequencing their DNA in bulk and using a computer to sort out the different species, but pre-genetic life would be invisible to that technique. It has no DNA to catalog. Maybe it uses RNA, which degrades more quickly, and is harder to study? Maybe the RNA is organized differently, in ways that would defy current sequencing technology? Maybe it uses a completely different mechanism, with molecules we don’t even know to look for? It’s fascinating to think there could be a whole other kingdom of life hiding in plain sight.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 2</h3>



<p>(this month&#8217;s image is a photo I took at Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, California. It consists of millions of tiny pebbles of polished sea glass in myriad colors. Each one is improbable to find at a beach, but all of them collectively tell the story of a larger-scale process that explains their presence—many years of disposing of waste bottles nearby)</p>



<p>This is part two of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Every living cell is a universal automaton, capable of an infinite variety of forms and lifestyles. The cell itself determines the range of possibility—what proteins can it make, how will they integrate into the whole, and how will they shape the organism’s life? But within that space of possibility, the gene sequence is the program that determines what <em>specific</em> body to make, and how it should respond to a chaotic environment. That program is of the utmost importance, selecting one specialized lifestyle out of infinitely many possibilities, most of which would never work. But who wrote it?</p>



<p>Life did. Or, in other words, <em>cells</em> wrote the programming for cells, but it doesn’t seem fair to call them “programmers.” A human programmer is a top-down problem solver. To modify some working software, I start by analyzing that system’s performance: what does it do, and how well? I then try to understand how the system works. I read its programming, and consider how that leads to the behavior I observe. I consider how the system might be better, what specific improvements I might make, and what consequences I expect. I design a change to the code, then tinker with it in a sandbox environment until it does exactly what I want with no surprises or side effects. Only when I’m satisfied do I push the code out for use in the real world.</p>



<p>How are cells supposed to do that? They don’t have a mind like I do. They monitor their own health and situation, but they can’t imagine themselves “from the outside.” They don’t understand their lifestyle, their goals, or their relationships with the world except in terms of stimulus and response. They can execute short stretches of programming from their DNA, but they can’t examine the program as a whole, or imagine what would happen if they ran some other program instead. Mutations and cross-breeding cause the program to change, but cells can’t verify those changes in a safe testing environment. They can only make a new organism, release it into the world, and hope for the best.</p>



<p>This seems like a paradox, but only from the perspective of an individual cell. Life <em>never</em> exists as a lone individual. It always consists of diverse communities and ecosystems. So let’s take that perspective. Life isn’t a cell. Life is a <em>vast</em> collection of cells, an unimaginably huge number of concurrent individuals, living and dying continuously over billions of years. I like to think of it as a massively parallel computer. Life learns by accumulating and generalizing over the experiences of many lifetimes. It tries out many lifestyles simultaneously; whole different categories of lifestyles in different species and niches; many variations on a theme, among organisms of the same species. Whether any individual will be successful is hard to predict, because luck is such a huge factor. But by running the same experiments thousands of trillions of times over, life can get a relatively clear picture of what works and what doesn’t.</p>



<p>From this massively parallel perspective, each cell is a processor unit with two jobs. The first job is to live and reproduce. We normally think of that as “the purpose” of life, but from the collective perspective, it’s just the engine that keeps the system as a whole running. Individual lifetimes come and go rapidly and continuously like the cycles in a computer processor. The <em>second</em> job of each cell is <strong>to learn about the Universe and how to thrive in it, then integrate that information back into the system’s programming. That is life’s deeper purpose</strong>. Each cell has a very limited perspective and can only do this in a minimal way. But taken all together, vast numbers of cells can behave much more like a traditional programmer.</p>



<p>A cell has no understanding of what it does or how it fits into the big picture, but, in a sense, life as a whole <em>does</em>. Life consists of every cell, every lifestyle, every program that has worked so far, and all the dead ends that <em>aren’t</em> represented. That’s a tremendous amount of information about what the system does, which parts are performing better than others, and where there’s untapped potential. There’s no top-down designer, but this information, embodied in the population itself, still shapes the system’s evolution. Each cell acts selfishly, but by competing and collaborating with each other, life distributes resources to the parts of itself that are thriving in their niche, and encourages exploration of new lifestyles where opportunity lies.</p>



<p>The big difference between life and a human programmer is speculation. Humans <em>envision</em> the system as a whole and <em>imagine</em> where it might go. When I program a computer, I test ideas first in my mind and then in a virtual environment on the computer in order to avoid mistakes and dead ends. Life doesn’t do that, because its massively parallel, distributed design makes that impossible. There simply is no top-down view, no central authority to perceive and decide, no way to step out of the system for testing. Instead, life just tries everything. It tests code in production. It walks straight into failure rather than avoiding it. <strong>Death sorts what works from what doesn’t. That’s why we usually think of cells as “dumb” and humans as “smart.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>It would be better to think of humans as more efficient</strong>, because in a sense what we do isn’t so different. We both generate lots of options, test them, winnow them down to the most successful, and iterate. I do it with simulations in my brain, life does it with matter in the physical Universe. From a computational perspective, that doesn’t matter. A computer can be realized with cogs, transistors, neurons, or a simulation inside another computer. The materials can be anything so long as the <em>functionality</em> is the same. As individual living animals, it seems tragic and absurd that life must test out ideas by letting things die on a massive scale. From life’s perspective, though, a single lifetime is just a brief use of materials and programming that will get recycled for future experiments. If it were conscious, life as a collective whole wouldn’t regret (or notice!) the death of an organism any more than we regret the death of one of our cells.</p>



<p>You might argue that the human programmer also has <em>foresight</em>. I don’t just try stuff at random, I have a sense of what might work and what probably won’t. I use trial and error, but I <em>prioritize</em> and focus my exploration. It’s tempting to say cells <em>don’t</em> do this, but that’s too dismissive. Cells are quite opinionated. DNA doesn’t contain a blueprint for an organism, but a bunch of recipes that the cell can choose between depending on context. Cells must decide how to act. Evolution has equipped them with a wide variety of strategies and tools, and guidance on when to use them, all encoded in the DNA. This is how life learns from experience, plans ahead, and avoids dead ends. Life explores new paths at random, but it mostly tries out reasonable variations of known working strategies.</p>



<p>Individual cells aren’t much like human programmers, but they do have one thing in common: they write code. Mostly, the cell just copies its own DNA (copy / paste is a popular strategy among human programmers, too), but it makes an important decision: what variations to try in the next generation. This happens either through mutations, or by swapping genetic material with other cells. Without a top-down view of the gene sequence, this can only be a random process. The cell has no idea what changes it’s introducing, or what the consequences might be, but it <em>can</em> try to shape that randomness for the better. Primarily, this means spending a <em>ton</em> of time and energy on error correction, so that only a small number of mutations get through. It also shows up in things like mate selection, genetic recombination, and preparing the environment for the next generation.</p>



<p>I like to think of Darwin’s story as how life got started. Random mutation and selection are all you need to evolve better forms. As we learn more about cells, though, we see there’s a lot more going on. Life didn’t just find better lifestyles, it invented a general purpose platform capable of an infinite variety of lifestyles. As a collective, life uses that platform to explore many lifestyles simultaneously, pruning dead ends and investing more resources into exploring evolutionary paths that seem fruitful. Life started out randomly, but it grew more opinionated over time, and it has evolved many sophisticated ways to direct and shape its own evolution. That will be the topic of my next post.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>Imagine your skull is a cockpit. A tiny You sits in front of a view screen and a dashboard, watching the world go by, pulling levers, and pushing buttons. Your body is a robot, precision engineered to protect you, keep you informed, and respond to your every command. It’s a complex and sophisticated machine, but not intelligent. It does what you tell it to do. Its shape and function were exquisitely designed by God or evolution, and encoded as DNA. That molecule represents the full blueprints for the machine. Now that the design has been perfected, all you have to do is follow the instructions step by step to make the ultimate human tool: your body.</p>



<p>That was probably very easy to imagine. The concept shows up all the time in the media, whether we’re talking about the literal giant robots from <em>Power Rangers</em>, or the psychological metaphors from movies like <em>Inside Out</em>. This way of conceiving the mind comes naturally to us, in part because that’s how it feels to be a person, sometimes. Great thinkers like René Descartes built whole philosophies around this duality of body and mind / soul. It has come to shape how our society works in many profound ways. Unfortunately, science tells a  different story.</p>



<p>Perhaps the first clue that something is off is how human-centric this picture is. Life was around for billions of years before people or brains came onto the scene. Even single-celled organisms perceive the world and quickly respond in ways that show awareness of their situation and how the world works, no brains necessary. When cells band together to make bodies, they often have tiny brains (like insects) or no brains at all (like plants). Humans are among the small minority of species who are entirely dependent on their big brains for survival. Does that mean that we’re one of the <em>only</em> intelligent species on this planet? Are all the others just empty robots with no one in the pilot seat?</p>



<p>Some might think of DNA as a blueprint that specifies every detail about how to build and operate a living thing, but the reality is much more complicated than that. It’s better to think of DNA as a family’s collection of cookbooks, passed on from generation to generation. They’re full of ingredient lists, recipes, and instructions. The family wouldn’t know how to cook at all without those books, so they’re critical to survival. They include all of the family’s daily staples and seasonal favorites. Even if, in theory, the family could get by on a more exotic diet, they don&#8217;t. Their cookbooks cover the full range of cuisine that they’re comfortable with, and they don’t often branch out.</p>



<p>And yet, there’s plenty of interpretation involved. What should the family cook for dinner tonight? Which recipes and books are more popular, and which go unused? How do they manage the pantry, and what do they do when they don’t have all the right ingredients? Just because the recipe says one thing, it doesn’t mean they have to do it that way. In fact, the recipe books are littered with sticky notes which suggest variations. They mark which parts of the recipe to skip, which ingredients to go heavy on, and recommend substitutions. The family can even mix and match parts from multiple recipes, or exchange recipes with friends to try something new.</p>



<p>This is getting a little too anthropomorphic. Cells don’t think about this sort of thing, because “thinking” isn’t how they do it. In reality, we&#8217;re talking about molecules, banging around together in chaotic but reliable ways according to the laws of physics. They don’t have any “intentions,” except maybe the ones implicit in their evolved recipes. But this is how they behave. Each cell is autonomous, responding to the environment with spontaneity. The DNA serves as a reference book, not a program. It isn’t even used to construct the cell. Remember, cells reproduce by dividing in half. Nature never builds a cell from scratch. Instead, half the family takes half the house, half the pantry, and a full copy of all the cookbooks. They wave goodbye, then carry on living as they always have, just as a separate cell with a separate fate.</p>



<p>DNA is a crucial resource, representing countless generations of acquired knowledge and wisdom. But it is <em>not</em> a blueprint, and that’s critical to how evolution works. Every cell and every organism lives an open-ended life, doing their best to survive with what they’re given. When circumstances change, life improvises and diversifies. The same genes may cause different behaviors in new contexts. When one way of living is blocked, old neglected genes may resurface, bringing back old ways of living. In stressful times, cells increase their own mutation rates, taking a risk to generate new variations which might get them out of a bind. This makes life far more flexible than if every aspect of design and behavior was explicitly laid out in the genome.</p>



<p>This becomes even more important for organisms with complex bodies. If DNA really was a blueprint, then building a human body would require precisely positioning and configuring each one of 37 trillion cells. Even if that process was 99.99999% perfect, there’d still be millions of errors. Luckily, this process is bottom-up, with each cell coordinating with its neighbors to figure out their relationships, what needs doing, and how to work together. That makes errors much more tolerable, since one cell can take over for another, or work around whatever defect is in the way. If the body were built from literal blueprints with no room for improvisation, then even a single cell out of line could potentially throw off everything that comes after. Errors would be much more likely to cascade and accumulate, potentially becoming fatal.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most astounding thing is that each cell in a body has a copy of the <em>same</em> set of cookbooks. They just read them differently, adopting a lifestyle to fit their place in the body. A bit like people in a society, each cell in the body tries to play its own role, and many different roles interact to make something much more than the sum of its parts. From many independent observations, decisions, and actions made locally by each cell, higher order structures and behaviors emerge. Cells make up organs and bodies. They manage bodily resources, capture and aggregate information about the world, and respond in coordinated ways. They perform extraordinary feats, like moving 37 trillion cells through space, gracefully and without damage.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a swarm of nanobots, clinging together to form a giant mecha. This mecha has evolved to do something useful, but its shape and function are only loosely defined. Each nanobot is a mindless automaton, operating independently within some constraints that are just specific enough for it to serve some purpose within the greater whole. These nanobots cluster to form dynamic structures, nested machines made of machines, in constant motion, building up to massive size and complexity. In order to manage this unwieldy bulk, the nanobots weave together into a neuromorphic computer. This specialized sub-processor simulates the world in real time, predicts what comes next, and carefully coordinates the timing of activity across this whole vast assemblage.</p>



<p>Part of that computer is responsible for imagining what it’s like to <em>be</em> the giant mecha. Its whole existence is within a simulated environment, extrapolated from the trillions of tiny motes of sensory data provided by the swarm. It watches the behaviors and emotions produced by the swarm, and uses them to tell stories about the values, needs, and intentions that guide the mecha&#8217;s behavior. It makes educated guesses about what the mecha will do next, which the swarm uses as hints to guide their behavior. As the only part of the mecha that is self-aware, and having no direct perception of the nanobots themselves, this simulation imagines itself to be in charge, and assumes the whole arrangement is for its benefit.</p>



<p>I know this is an uncomfortable image for many people. It’s not warm and fuzzy. It probably feels strange, maybe even disgusting. It’s not how we like to think of ourselves. However, “strange” and “disgusting” are also excellent words to describe living bodies, in all their infinite variety. Human beings are machines made of meat and bone. They are also unique souls, with meaningful lives, profound experiences, and extraordinary talents. The challenge is to see this not as a contradiction, but as two sides of the same coin. We can be the pilot in the cockpit, <em>and</em> the nanobot swarm.</p>



<p>What do you think? Is this a useful way of thinking about mind and body? Have you ever noticed moments when your body dominates your mind and the &#8220;pilot in the cockpit&#8221; illusion seems to break down? Or do you think I&#8217;m under-selling the power and importance of the brain? Is it right to say that &#8220;nobody&#8217;s home&#8221; in life without a brain, or is it more complicated than that? Any questions about this &#8220;cookbook&#8221; metaphor and what&#8217;s <em>really</em> going on in the cell? I&#8217;d love to hear from you. Please, join the conversation in the comments section.</p>
