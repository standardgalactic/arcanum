<p>Well, the third semester of my PhD is wrapping up! I really enjoyed my classes this time around. Evolutionary Computation was super interesting, and sparked all sorts of connections with my research. My class project was a big success, and I hope to turn it into a conference paper. I‚Äôll share more on that later, but here‚Äôs a <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn/113544231802797345">sneak peek</a> if you‚Äôre curious. Deep Learning was also pretty great, and I feel like I have a more deep and intuitive understanding of what‚Äôs actually going on when you train or interact with an AI. One of the more exciting / challenging topics we covered was Transformers, the new model architecture that powers ChatGPT and its ilk. In some sense, Transformers are quite simple, but they‚Äôre definitely not intuitive; understanding why they‚Äôre built the way they are, and why that works so well takes some effort. So, to help cement my understanding, I wrote a blog post about it, and you get a bonus episode for the holidays!</p>



<p>Over winter break I hope to develop my Evolutionary Computation class project into a full paper. In short, it&#8217;s a new kind of evolutionary algorithm, inspired by endosymbiosis, that works in surprising ways. So far I‚Äôve only used it to solve a trivial toy problem, so I‚Äôll probably also start work on a follow-up study, exploring what practical applications this new algorithm might be good for. And, of course, I‚Äôve got more research ideas to explore beyond that. I‚Äôm quite excited to try evolving a population without genomes, for instance. So many ideas! I hope I‚Äôll be able to keep a few projects running in parallel, balancing my time across them, and leaving room for me in between. I‚Äôll continue to share updates as I make progress.</p>



<p>In the spring, I‚Äôll delve even deeper into Deep Learning, with a class that explores counter-intuitive results and how surprisingly effective DL is sometimes. How is it even possible to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù using nothing but vector math? What are these models really doing, and why are some models better than others? Should be fun. I‚Äôll also be delving into the math of chaos and fractals. I hope that will be useful for my research into self-modifying dynamic systems (ie, simulated life <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="üòõ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), and lead to some very pretty visuals I can share. We‚Äôll see!</p>



<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll share the post about Transformers right after this, and that will wrap up another year of blog posts. More to come in January!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm at an interesting moment in my studies, so I thought I‚Äôd let you know what‚Äôs going on!</p>



<p>Year two of my PhD program has begun. I‚Äôm about a month into my third semester, and things are going well. I‚Äôm taking two classes right now: Evolutionary Computation, and Deep Learning. Most of my Computer Science education has been about how to design algorithms and write software to solve different kinds of problems, but these classes are different. This semester, I‚Äôm learning how to get computers to discover their own algorithms, and write their own software. Honestly, the state of the art here is still quite primitive. We‚Äôve found some very impressive techniques, but they each apply to a narrow domain, and we don‚Äôt understand them nearly as well as we‚Äôd like. Which makes them fun topics to study. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The other fun thing about this semester is that both of my classes are built around student projects. More or less, I get to pick projects that fit with my research, and the class is there to help me find the time, resources, and guidance to complete the projects successfully. I like this much better than undergraduate style courses built around assignments and exams that are very generic and may not be relevant to my work. We‚Äôll see how things unfold, but I‚Äôm currently planning to work on two projects that I‚Äôm excited about.</p>



<p>For Evolutionary Computation, I‚Äôm working on an experiment about endosymbiosis. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE">this classic experiment</a>, which examined how bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, and how genetic innovations spread through the population spatially. I‚Äôm going to try evolving a host environment that supports an inner population, a bit like how my gut supports a microbiome. The hope is that the host will be able to design a supportive environment, with different regions that cultivate ‚Äúmicrobes‚Äù with different traits, such that it can guide and coax them into evolving more specialized forms. This is an exciting experiment for me, because I‚Äôm not sure what to expect, but I‚Äôm pretty confident that <em>something</em> interesting will happen.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdXXQwS7goi1ItbTdONUzbfEiFKBIKils0XIfkXZl1xwzGxuTrV76lD5OFiNLNtXdXMpPz_do1AW3qdFEFbe4loZzIcjVBTtC7ciQbwbYhN1TQMr3tf_AuT-skSA-X_9lOauzGL31dv3Lj7hQqRBu0stv8?key=F266DdYKyjrziMBoqIpF8A" alt="A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred."></p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred.</p>



<p>For Deep Learning, I‚Äôm going to use computer vision techniques to detect interesting patterns in the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/">Game of Life</a>, since I‚Äôve been using that as an environment for my evolution experiments. The Game of Life has very simple rules, but it evolves in complex ways. Most patterns quickly dissolve into empty space or settle into a few boring, stable forms. But rarely, you get something much more interesting. For decades, people have been exploring this space, finding interesting patterns and classifying them. You get huge complex structures that stabilize themselves, change continuously in repeating cycles, or even propel themselves and move at a steady pace. I‚Äôll build a system that can detect and categorize these patterns, so that when my evolutionary algorithm finds them, I can reward it and ask for ‚Äúmore like that.‚Äù</p>

<p>This month‚Äôs essay is inspired by my Evolutionary Computation class, and the work I‚Äôve been doing to develop the specific research questions I want to focus on for my PhD. So, check back on Wednesday to learn more about how evolution got started, and why it‚Äôs worth asking: how does evolution evolve?</p>

<p>(I took this post‚Äôs photo at the Star Trek Original Series Set Tour in Ticonderoga, New York. It‚Äôs a view of the warp core of the USS Enterprise, which is only a few feet deep but looks much larger thanks to forced perspective. The room is filled with structures with complicated geometric shapes, technical looking panels, and dramatic lighting in red, blue, and purple.)</p>



<p>In my last post, I wrote about my latest research project and why I was so excited to present it at GECCO, the premier conference for evolutionary computation. I promised a follow-up, and here it is! Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt make it to Melbourne. Instead, I had a very complicated and protracted battle with my University‚Äôs travel planning system, United Airlines, and the Australian visa office, all from the comfort of my home in Vermont. I couldn‚Äôt even participate in the event remotely, because of the time zone difference. This is all very disappointing, but I tried to make the best of it. I‚Äôve been busy with the next iteration of this project, and enjoying a bit of ‚Äústaycation‚Äù time here in New England (hence this month‚Äôs cover photo).</p>



<p>In any case, my paper <em>did</em> get published, and I‚Äôd still like to share the materials I presented virtually at the conference. It‚Äôs mostly intended for a technical audience, but I hope at least some of my readers will find it interesting. The paper is titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638530.3654259">A Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm for Co-evolving Genotypes and Genotype / Phenotype Maps</a>, and is available for free online. I had to cut it down to just four pages, since it was accepted as a poster, so I also wrote up an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype-results/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md">extended analysis of my results</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1/blob/main/README.md">hoverview of my algorithm&#8217;s implementation</a>,  for those who want to go deeper. There&#8217;s also a digital version of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3x58W46RPuXOkqY6NavS6ndpeaEgiZB/view?usp=drive_link">poster</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ej09sxSULmzwNd65EPQInTUySmsUtiq/view?usp=drive_link">short video</a> overview of my experiment.</p>



<p>I continue to work on this idea, and it is starting to evolve beyond what I presented in that paper. Right now, I‚Äôm actively deconstructing and rebuilding the algorithm. CPPNs are an important and well known part of the AI field, so I‚Äôm trying to describe precisely how my algorithm is different, and which of those differences account for the remarkable results I found. Originally I thought of this research as being about epigenetics specifically, but as I try to generalize and simplify, what I‚Äôm left with looks like straight-up endosymbiosis. I‚Äôve been thinking of this algorithm as a metaphor for a cell and its genes / nucleus, but it could just as easily be a metaphor for an animal and its community of microbes. This is exciting, since I‚Äôd love to do more research on endosymbiosis, and I really like the idea that perhaps symbiosis is the driving force behind intelligence as we know it, fundamentally changing the dynamics of evolution.</p>



<p>Anyway, that‚Äôs how I see it for the moment, and where I hope my research will lead in the near future. For now, though, I‚Äôm wrapping up my summer with a few more fun outings, and preparing for the start of classes later this month. I‚Äôll be diving deep into both evolutionary computation and deep learning, which I‚Äôm really looking forward to.</p>

<p>Hello there, reader. I hope you‚Äôve been enjoying the blog. It‚Äôs been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That‚Äôs going great, but it‚Äôs keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.</p>



<p>So far, I‚Äôve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don‚Äôt think I can keep up that pace. I‚Äôve got a few finished posts queued up, but I‚Äôve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every <em>three</em> months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We‚Äôll see!</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I‚Äôd share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I‚Äôm about two thirds of the way through my first semester.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It‚Äôs electrifying. I don‚Äôt know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I‚Äôm often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they‚Äôre pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I‚Äôm reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I‚Äôm integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I‚Äôm learning isn‚Äôt radically new or different, but I‚Äôm fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on research yet, but I&#8217;m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others‚Äô, and vice versa. It‚Äôs helping see new angles and new possibilities. I‚Äôm talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I‚Äôd like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I&#8217;m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It‚Äôs forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others‚Äô ideas.</p>



<p>This is exactly what I was hoping for. I‚Äôve been on my own since leaving Google, and the experience is just underscoring something I know to be true: human minds aren‚Äôt meant to work alone. We&#8217;re social creatures, and most of us just cannot reach our full capacity in isolation. At UVM, my mind is constantly stimulated, and I‚Äôm always challenged to stretch myself, try new ideas, and make new contributions. I feel I can go much further here, and accomplish great things. Of course, the flip side is that it‚Äôs <em>exhausting</em>, especially while I‚Äôm still new and figuring out how things work here. The pace of activity is very fast, and there‚Äôs much more to read, do, and learn than I could possibly fit into a day.</p>



<p>In some sense, that‚Äôs already very familiar. My experience at Google (especially near the end, when I was leading teams) was also a fast paced, continuous, information overload. The key skills for dealing with that are prioritization and time management. I just have to pick what to spend my time on, and let everything else pass me by with minimal interference. Thankfully, I‚Äôve gotten really good at that.</p>



<p>Still, I‚Äôm definitely feeling challenged right now, and so busy I barely have time to breathe. There are a few reasons for that. One is just that the pace of life was so much gentler over the past couple of years as I made this transition. I was working very hard, but my work was self-paced and I had very little external pressure. I took my time. Nobody was depending on me, or judging my performance. So, I‚Äôm having the jarring experience of suddenly stepping onto a moving treadmill. Only now, after a few months of settling in, have I found a good rhythm where I can keep up with all my work, have a life, and also pursue my own research goals.</p>



<p>This is also hard because I‚Äôm running on a very different sort of treadmill than what I experienced at Google. In a sense, it‚Äôs easier. I have a ton of work to do, but it‚Äôs mostly low-stakes reading, writing, and coding at a steady pace. As a manager at Google, my work was mostly decisions, strategy, and people issues. I spent a lot of time moving from crisis to crisis. I had to act quickly and decisively with limited information. My decisions would have a big, often irreversible impact on people‚Äôs lives (sometimes individuals I knew and cared about, and sometimes millions of strangers). I was accountable for those human consequences. That‚Äôs stressful! By comparison, grad school work is fun and low pressure.</p>



<p>In another sense, Google was actually much easier than academia, because it was highly structured. There, everyone had a well defined job role with explicit expectations. We had official priorities and ways of doing things that everyone adhered to. Everyone was organized into teams, which served complementary purposes and fit into a coherent whole. Leaders held meetings with regular cadences every week, month, quarter, etc., checking in on progress and aligning people on their mission, values, goals, and priorities. We never lived up to the ideal, but Google felt a bit like a clockwork mechanism. We all had a function, individually and collectively, and we worked together in lock-step to make it happen.</p>



<p>Academia and science are <em>far</em> less structured. Every PhD, every lab, every department, and every school do things differently. There are very few hard constraints, and anything that fits within them is valid. In grad school, lectures and assignments feel a bit more like ‚Äúrecommended work,‚Äù and you&#8217;re expected to invest only as much into them as makes sense for your needs. This is freeing, but also in some sense very frustrating. There are no best practices. Nobody can tell me what to do, or how to succeed. There‚Äôs very little indication of how I‚Äôm doing, or what progress I‚Äôm making. Everyone‚Äôs working more or less independently, on only sorta related projects, within a vaguely defined scope, based on their own judgment. There‚Äôs little sharing, few standards, and plenty of waste.</p>



<p>That said, science <em>should</em> be less structured than engineering. It <em>must</em> be. The university is designed this way to encourage diverse ways of thinking and of approaching problems. The challenge of science is that we don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt know what to look for, where to look, or how we&#8217;ll find it. Very often important truths are hidden behind common ideas and practices that everyone ‚Äúknows‚Äù to be right, even though they are blatantly wrong! It‚Äôs important that students can follow in the footsteps of great thinkers and flesh out their works, but also that they can go in completely new directions and find what was overlooked. The chaos and freedom can be challenging, but it‚Äôs a necessary ingredient for innovation.</p>

<p>Well, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on with me. I hope my thoughts on grad student life are interesting. I will start experimenting with the format of this blog and see where it goes. If you have any thoughts or suggestions about that, please let me know! If you‚Äôd like to stay more up to date on what I‚Äôm doing and thinking, I‚Äôm most active on Mastodon. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s basically a smaller, nerdier version of Twitter that isn&#8217;t owned by an alt-right friendly oligarch, and with much healthier communication norms and moderation practices. I post there pretty often, and I respond to most comments / DMs. You can find my profile <a href="http://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">here</a>.</p>

<p>(Photo is a shot I took of downtown Burlington, VT at twilight with lights in the trees and a clock tower in the background)</p>



<p>A year and a half ago, I took a big risk by leaving my comfortable career in the tech industry to pursue a graduate degree. Like many people, recent events inspired me to find more meaningful work, but it&#8217;s an intimidating change. How do you even do that? I have ideas I want to pursue, but they&#8217;re not exactly mainstream, and grad school is competitive. I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but I decided to try. I pushed my way through, and I&#8217;m very happy with <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/04/06/back-to-school/">the results</a>. I don‚Äôt claim to have a secret recipe for career change, but I want to share my experience in case it‚Äôs helpful for you or someone you know.</p>



<p>My first challenge was realizing: I have no idea what grad school is even like. Most universities have two parallel programs: they provide a baseline education to the masses for a profit, and then they actually do science and train scientists. Generally speaking, the only thing these have in common is the college where they happen. I got my baseline undergraduate education at Brown, but that didn‚Äôt teach me anything about grad school. While I was on campus, I had the <em>opportunity</em> to learn about grad school, but I wasn‚Äôt interested then, so I let that chance pass me by.</p>



<p>Many years later, I tried to learn what grad school is and how to succeed there by talking to students and professors. This was surprisingly painful. In general, folks did a poor job explaining what grad school is like, and gave me all sorts of conflicting advice. Gradually, I began to see two big reasons why:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>. There‚Äôs no one ‚Äúgrad school experience.‚Äù Every school, discipline, program, and lab is different. They have their own jargon, priorities, and expectations. Yet, when asking someone about it, they will describe their experience as typical, and give specific advice that would have helped them. The best way to get a sense of what&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; is to talk to lots of folks and pay careful attention to where they <em>disagree</em>. Conflicting advice helped me understand the full range of programs out there.</li>



<li><strong>Immersion</strong>. Grad school is an immersive experience. I expect I‚Äôll show up on campus, get swept up in things, and gradually discover I‚Äôm ‚Äúbeing a grad student‚Äù without ever being taught how. This sort of experiential learning is fast and effective, but it‚Äôs hard to explain. People just don‚Äôt have the words. They shared lots of details, but without context those mostly went over my head. They didn&#8217;t mention the ‚Äúobvious stuff,‚Äù because it&#8217;s intuitive for them, and I didn&#8217;t know to ask about it. To learn the fundamentals, I had to <em>read between the lines</em>. When something didn&#8217;t add up, I&#8217;d look for hidden assumptions that could explain the reasoning. Cross referencing multiple conversations was important.</li>
</ol>



<p>The next challenge was finding the right place for me. At a high level, academia is divided into disciplines, like Physics, Biology, or Computer Science, and each of those has many sub-disciplines nested within. Each one is working on a certain set of problems using certain tools and methods. Many grad students start with no clear idea of what they‚Äôll do. They just pick a discipline, learn about it, and find a way to make themselves useful. My situation is different: I have specific ideas I want to pursue. Unfortunately, scientists aren‚Äôt very interested in cool ideas from outsiders, unless they happen to fit within their field of research.</p>



<p>It took me a long time to figure out what discipline to join. It seems like it should be obvious, but many research questions like mine are <em>interdisciplinary</em>, and don&#8217;t fit the usual options. Ultimately, it came down to what <em>tools</em> I wanted to use. Even though my ideas are about life, self-making, and meaning, I want to study these phenomena <em>as algorithms</em>, analyze their behavior, and recreate them in a computer. This led me to focus on Computer Science, and the sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. I‚Äôm ambitious and experienced, so naturally I thought I‚Äôd apply to the top schools for CS and AI. That was a mistake.</p>



<p>The problem is,the big-name schools are mainstream by definition, and my research is not. I‚Äôm actually quite concerned that the field has lost its way. They have too narrow a definition for ‚Äúintelligence,‚Äù and tend to worry more about new consumer technology than understanding nature. But the big schools are the ones <em>setting</em> this agenda. Their programs are highly competitive, and they‚Äôre looking for people who will advance their goals. Even if I somehow managed to get in, they would not provide a supportive environment for me as a student.</p>



<p>If not the big name schools, then where? There are many options, covering an <em>enormous</em> range. How do I find the right one? The promotional materials online are quite generic and unhelpful, so again I turned to people. I cold emailed professors doing vaguely related work, and maybe one in five replied. At first, they barely understood what I was talking about or what to suggest, but usually they could point me at someone slightly more relevant than themselves. That way, I gradually worked my way to folks who ‚Äúgot it.‚Äù This led me to a totally new list of schools to apply to. It took nearly a full year, and I wish I had longer.</p>



<p>Figuring out where I fit in was also about looking inwards. I had ideas, but they were vague and complex. To talk to people, I had to explain myself in ways they could understand. That was hard, but useful. It forced me to consolidate my ideas, disentangle them, and look at them from many angles. I wrote it all down, which was important. Most professors don‚Äôt have time for extra reading, but the writing process helped me organize my thoughts, making them much easier to talk about. Some of that writing even ended up on this blog.</p>



<p>I also did a lot of reading, which was invaluable. I read books and journal articles covering a wide swath <em>around</em> my ideas in different fields. This let me survey the kinds of work people were actually doing, and imagine myself in their shoes. I was surprised by how many ideas excited me in theory, but sounded like a drag in practice. I also learned about the jargon, ideas, and thinkers in this space. That made it much easier to talk to professors, helped me find new leads, and gave me new tools for my research.</p>



<p>What are my big takeaways from all of this? Grad school is a bit of a catch-22. It‚Äôs a big, complex, and opaque institution. It‚Äôs hard to learn about it without being a part of it. It‚Äôs hard to get accepted or be successful without knowing the field, the professors, the incentive structures‚Äîin other words, being an insider already. Luckily, it‚Äôs possible to pick up this knowledge. It‚Äôs just a difficult and time-consuming process, and it helps to have connections. Most professors don‚Äôt have time for outsiders, but some are eager to help, <em>especially</em> for ideas near and dear to their hearts. Once I finally found folks who shared my interests, they welcomed me with open arms.</p>



<p>So that‚Äôs my journey, what I did, what I learned, and how it went. Now I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Does any of this surprise you, or resonate with your own experience? Do you have any questions about getting into higher education, or advice for others just getting started? Any thoughts on the state of academia generally? Join the conversation in the comments! It‚Äôs my favorite part of this blog, so don‚Äôt miss out.</p>
