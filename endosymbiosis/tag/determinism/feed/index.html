<p>There&#8217;s been a recent bout of people talking about free will and determinism. Perhaps because of Sapolsky&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58902324-determined">Determined</a>?</p>



<p>But so much of the discussion I see is grounded in a very strange conception of free will. For many people, “free will” means that a mind must have the power to bypass causation and alter reality purely because it wants to, without any external influences.</p>



<p>This is very silly. It&#8217;s secret dualism. It&#8217;s like saying free will only exists if my transcendent soul can reach into the universe (from outside?) and arbitrarily tinker with physics. Science tells us that this sort of free will does not exist. But rather than throw out the concept entirely, maybe we just need a better definition?</p>



<p>When talking philosophy, it’s so important to establish good definitions.</p>



<p>If the Universe is determined, then so are we. We can’t break the laws of physics. In some sense our behavior is <em>unchangeable</em>. We make choices, but if you re-ran the Universe in precisely the same way, we’d act the same every time.</p>



<p>But so what? Even this kind of decision is real and meaningful. We choose based on our experiences and our preferences. Those aren’t in our control, but they’re still “us.” Those choices matter. They determine how the Universe unfolds, and what experiences we all have. We really do make things better or worse, as we choose.</p>



<p>Maybe we don’t <em>change</em> reality. Maybe it was always gonna be this way. But so what? The Universe is vast and chaotic. Even if it’s <em>theoretically</em> predictable, practically it’s <em>not</em>. It’s pure fantasy to think we can accurately predict even a single person’s actions beyond the next few moments.</p>



<p>Even if we’re determined: we experience, we consider, we choose, we act, and that determines what comes next. That feels like “free will” enough for me.</p>



<p>The point of Sapolsky’s book is that we are animals, with innate biases and limitations. We live in a society that determines how we live our lives. We have experiences that shape us. We shape our selves, but only the parts that <em>aren’t</em> determined by reality. We can’t take “full credit,” because so much is just luck.</p>



<p>So where do we get off torturing people in prison for being “evil”? People aren’t evil. People can be selfish, delusional, psychopathic, traumatized, desperate, etc. Maybe they need help. Maybe they’re dangerous to themselves or others. Maybe society should intervene. But to a large extent they didn’t <em>choose</em> that life, but were forced there by circumstances beyond their control. So when we intervene, why the nastiness? Why should we <em>punish</em> someone for being born with a genetic mutation, or an abusive father?</p>



<p>I’m not sure I completely agree with Sapolsky, but he makes a good point worth considering. I don’t want people to reject it because “free will” doesn’t mean what they think it means.</p>
