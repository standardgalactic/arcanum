<p>One thing that fascinates me about life on Earth is that it’s all built with proteins and genetics. Every living cell, even the most primitive microbe, has at its core a universal molecular-scale 3D printer, controlled by an evolved programming language, which gets read and error-corrected from a highly stable gigabit-scale molecular data storage medium (DNA).</p>



<p>In short, every living thing, every single cell, is a mechanism of astonishing complexity and sophistication, and they <em>all</em> share a common design. That’s wild. Life could not have started that way. The very first cells <em>must</em> have been much simpler and then evolved to be like this. But then… where are they? What happened to those pre-genetic cells? We’ve never found them. There are a few good answers to why, and I find them all fascinating.</p>



<p>One interesting possibility is that pre-genetic life is long gone. After all, it originated billions of years ago! Earth is a hostile place, and those early life forms must have been even more fragile than the ones we see today. Not to mention, there’s nothing life likes more than to <em>eat</em> other life. If “modern” cells with genetics outperformed their more primitive cousins, maybe they drove them extinct and replaced them?</p>



<p>Or, perhaps pre-genetic life never existed on this planet at all. Maybe the mechanism of genetics is so complex it needs much more time to evolve from scratch. Maybe the process got started elsewhere in the universe, and then got deposited here in cosmic debris. In that case, genetic cells just <em>colonized</em> Earth and adapted to living here. That’s an exciting possibility, because that might mean there’s more life “out there,” and we could find other living planets like our own.</p>



<p>Just as fascinating is the idea that pre-genetic life is still alive and well on this planet. That universal 3D printer for proteins is an incredibly powerful tool for cells, but its primary value is exploration. It makes it possible to invent new molecules and thus new lifestyles. It enables life to spread, complexify, and settle every corner of this planet.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t make the cell any better at living <em>one particular</em> lifestyle. It may be that cells evolved diversity to escape the dominance of the first life forms, that cornered their particular niche so well that finding a new niche was the only option. Perhaps genetics was invented to escape and branch out from this overcrowded primordial environment. If that’s the case, then maybe there’s a thriving colony of pre-genetic life, still clinging to a hydro-thermal vent somewhere, just as it has for billions of years. It’s terribly unlikely, but in theory, we could find it. How exciting would that be?</p>



<p>But what if pre-genetic life isn’t rare at all? What if we just can’t see it? Certainly, if it exists, it would be microscopic, and that already makes it very difficult to find and study. We’ve been cataloging single-celled organisms for centuries now, yet we’ve observed just a tiny fraction of them, and gene sequenced even fewer.</p>



<p>Maybe we overlook pre-genetic life because it looks like “normal” cells? We can now take a census of whole microbial communities by sequencing their DNA in bulk and using a computer to sort out the different species, but pre-genetic life would be invisible to that technique. It has no DNA to catalog. Maybe it uses RNA, which degrades more quickly, and is harder to study? Maybe the RNA is organized differently, in ways that would defy current sequencing technology? Maybe it uses a completely different mechanism, with molecules we don’t even know to look for? It’s fascinating to think there could be a whole other kingdom of life hiding in plain sight.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 3</h1>



<p>(The image for this week is an illustration from Waddington&#8217;s 1957 paper <em>The Strategy of the Genes</em>, which is often used to explain canalization. It shows a landscape with shallow, forking grooves and a ball rolling down that landscape. Although the ball&#8217;s path isn&#8217;t fully determined, the existing impressions in the landscape constrain it to one of a few likely paths)</p>



<p>This is part three of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">the beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Darwin explained part of the great mystery of life: how complexity and intelligence can evolve from randomness. When DNA was discovered, this seemed to “seal the deal.” DNA is the molecule that describes an organism’s nature, makes traits heritable, and carries mutations that are fodder for natural selection. That seemed to explain everything, at first, but I would argue that’s just the beginning. The DNA molecule itself lies at the heart of an incredibly complex system of processes that manage its care, use, and replication. These systems are collectively studied as “epigenetics,” and science is just beginning to understand how they work and the impact they have on evolution.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that DNA is an inert molecule that does nothing by itself. It needs a cell, a sort of organic micro-robot, to interpret that DNA and turn it into form and behavior. So, in a sense, every living thing is made up of <em>two</em> evolved programs: the DNA and the cell. Both are made of physical matter, which are subject to mutations. Both share the same selective pressures and reproductive fate. They evolve together, but they have different purposes. For the most part, the DNA program is what determines the organism’s lifestyle. The cell decides how to read that program, and how to make changes to that program over a lifetime and across generations.</p>



<p>One of the most important ways cells influence their own programming is through mutations. These happen naturally. As molecules bang against each other and get exposed to UV radiation from the sun, they sometimes spontaneously change shape. When those molecules represent critical information for a species’ survival, that could be disastrous. For this reason, life invests a <em>ton</em> of energy into detecting and correcting errors. But this process is never perfect, and it can’t be. If life always copied itself <em>perfectly</em>, there would be no variation for selection to act on, and no evolution. Not only that, getting the error rate much lower than it already is would be prohibitively expensive. So, life strikes a healthy balance, allowing just enough mutation to be useful, but not enough to be dangerous.</p>



<p>Interestingly, that finely-tuned mutation rate is not constant and universal. There are some stretches of DNA that get <em>extra</em> error correction, always triple checked to ensure they stay as stable as possible. On the other hand, some stretches of DNA get actively shuffled, injecting randomness into things like the immune system, creating diversity that makes the population as a whole more robust. Perhaps most remarkable is that when cells get stressed out, they divert energy to other things, and away from error correction. This may just be an accidental side effect of the cell breaking down, but it might also be a survival strategy. To anthropomorphize, perhaps cells get creative when times are tough, trying out crazy ideas in the desperate hope that one might save them.</p>



<p>That said, a single DNA copying error can be <em>devastating</em>, so how does life cope? Remarkably, it can often just work around the problem. Living systems have a lot of redundancy, with many mutually supportive ways of doing basically the same thing. This leads to a phenomenon called “canalization.” The more critical some behavior is to life, and the longer it persists over many generations, the more redundancy builds up around it. This means that single errors may alter the behavior a little, change how it works, or make it less efficient, but probably won’t break it entirely.</p>



<p>When errors are too severe to recover from, an organism might just fail to thrive and die, but sometimes it actually notices the failure and decides to self-terminate. That may seem bizarre, but in multicellular organisms it makes a lot of sense. If the error is in a single cell, then removing that cell lets others take over its job. If the error would prevent the whole embryo from developing into a healthy adult, then it’s better to scrap the work in progress, recycle those materials, and start over from scratch. In other words, life has its own Quality Assurance processes, at multiple levels, which minimize investment into evolutionary dead ends.</p>



<p>Cells can also swap genes with each other, sharing useful recipes and trying them out in new combinations. Sex is one way to do it, aligning and remixing two complete genomes in an incredibly complex way that ensures the resulting DNA program is still valid. Simpler organisms like bacteria don’t do this, but swap genes in a much more free-form process called “horizontal gene transfer.” Basically, cells sometimes leave scraps of DNA lying around, or pick up those scraps and integrate them into their own programming. This can let a new behavior (like resisting some toxin or eating some food) spread very rapidly through a bacterial colony. Either way, randomly adopting genes <em>that have proven successful in another organism</em> is a much safer and more powerful way to create useful diversity than mutation alone.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that how a cell reads its DNA can change over a lifetime. Cells annotate their program with notes (ie, methylation) that indicate which recipes to avoid or use more of, depending on context. This is how single celled organisms adapt their behavior to a changing environment, and how cells in multicellular organisms differentiate into different kinds of tissues. Importantly, these notes are sometimes passed down across generations. For instance, an organism might survive near starvation by tuning down its metabolism, staying smaller, slower, and using less energy. That change is <em>heritable</em>. The next few generations will <em>also</em> have a slower metabolism, and if that serves them well, it could lead to long-lasting behavioral changes that eventually get encoded into the DNA itself.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve talked about how life modifies itself, but it also modifies the environment. Organisms can build caches, nests, and tools that make life easier, and these get passed on, too, both as hand-me-downs and as lessons. Organisms form an ecosystem, full of mutualistic relationships between species that make life easier. Over geological time, this has transformed our planet from a barren rock to a lush world full of possibility. Life cultivates a supportive environment for future generations, shaping their behavior and evolutionary fitness. Child care might be the most visible example, protecting each new life when it’s most fragile, then sending off the new generation in a good direction informed by the parent’s life experience.</p>



<p>In the basic Darwinian story, evolution is something that <em>happens to</em> organisms. Accidental changes occur randomly, and nature chooses which ones will persist. But as we’ve just seen, life does <em>not</em> leave things up to chance. Randomness plays a key role in biological evolution, but life manages that randomness carefully and uses it selectively. Life also does everything in its power to influence the next generation, in ways that are <em>not</em> random, but “purposeful” in a sense. A cell can’t understand <em>why</em> it does these things, but it does them for a reason: they worked well in the past, got selected for, and ended up in the cell’s programming.</p>



<p>This leads to a powerful realization: when it comes to influencing evolution, cells don’t understand what they’re doing, but many higher organisms <em>do</em>, at least a little. For instance, an animal can apply its full cognitive capacity, mind and all, to choosing a mate and raising its offspring. In this way, the cell has moved from blindly repeating what worked in the past, to making evolutionarily relevant decisions <em>intentionally</em>, with forethought and analysis. A dog may not understand genetics or think about the future of her species, but she <em>certainly</em> has strong opinions about who would make a good mate, when / where / how to raise her puppies, and which pups to give more or less attention to. She uses her senses, her instincts, and her big brain to make big decisions that shape evolution. She may not see the big picture, but she cares and makes informed choices nonetheless.</p>



<p>This helps explain the paradox of how life managed to become <em>so incredibly smart</em> just by randomly banging molecules together for a few billion years. Life may have started off randomly, but it quickly became more directed. <strong>Life </strong><strong><em>harnessed</em></strong><strong> Darwinian evolution to build a more powerful evolutionary algorithm, one that’s </strong><strong><em>opinionated</em></strong><strong> and shapes its own search space.</strong> At first, these evolution-shaping behaviors were simple and rigid, just tricks repeated by rote because they tended to make the next generation more successful. Then, as life became more intelligent, it started to apply that intelligence to shaping itself, creating a runaway process of recursive self-improvement.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The main takeaway from all this is that Darwin is the <em>beginning</em> of the story of evolution, not the end. Life uses all of its intelligent capacity to influence its own evolution. This led to a virtuous cycle. Increased intelligence gave life greater influence over evolution, which it used to become more intelligent, which gave it greater influence over evolution. For this reason, I think <strong>it’s better to say that life designed itself than to say it evolved by chance</strong>. The process of “design” here was more stochastic, collective, and unthinking than we normally associate with that word, but in the end, the result is the same.</p>



<p>This story is still uncertain. The science around autonomous robots, intelligent collectives, and epigenetics is relatively new, and changing all the time. Plenty of biologists push back hard against the idea of any sort of agency or direction in evolution, partly because they’ve been fighting against the theory of Intelligent Design for so long. Others believe we’re overdue for a <a href="https://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com/about-the-ees/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20extended%20evolutionary,i.e.%2C%20the%20modern%20synthesis).">new story about evolution</a>, and are trying to find the right narrative and the evidence to back it up. I hope my research into evolutionary algorithms might be a useful contribution to that effort. If you’d like to dig deeper into this topic, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526346279">Evolution in Four Dimensions</a> is an excellent overview of the field of epigenetics.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell&#8217;s Eye View of Evolution, Part 1</h3>



<p>(This month&#8217;s image is a photo I took of the full-scale model of Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine at the Mountain View Computer History Museum. This is one of the first examples of a programmable digital computer. It&#8217;s a completely mechanical device, operated by hand crank.)</p>



<p>This is part one of a three-part series. For an overview, check out the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">introduction</a>.</p>



<p>In the traditional story of evolution, each organism lives a single lifestyle, and the forces of nature select which ones are fit enough to reproduce. From that perspective, evolution is something that <em>happens to</em> life. But this story fails to explain something very strange and important: cells are not single-purpose machines. Although they only live one lifestyle at a time, they have the capacity to live an infinite variety of lifestyles, depending on their DNA programming. That requires an enormous amount of complexity and effort that <em>doesn’t</em> directly contribute to a life well lived. In fact, being programmable doesn’t help <em>at all</em> in a single lifetime if the program never changes. So why does life work this way?</p>



<p>To make sense of this, let&#8217;s look at a parallel example in computer technology. Consider an ATM. It’s a highly specialized kind of machine, but these days if you look under the hood you’ll often find a Windows PC that’s <em>programmed to be</em> an ATM. That seems like an odd choice at first. ATMs do things most PCs <em>don’t</em> (like dispensing cash), and Windows supports things that you <em>don’t want</em> in an ATM (like running random programs off the internet). You could make a better, safer, more efficient ATM if you designed a custom machine for that purpose, but nobody does that, because it’s harder. Digital computers are so versatile and easy to reprogram that they show up <em>everywhere</em>. As they get used in new applications, their range of capabilities <em>expands</em>, enabling new use cases and further innovation.</p>



<p>Cells are very similar. Being programmable doesn’t help with any one lifestyle, but it makes it possible to explore new lifestyles relatively quickly and easily. Each individual operates in a complex, roundabout way that only uses a fraction of the cell’s potential. That seems like a bad thing, but the adaptability makes it worthwhile. The world is in constant flux, especially once organisms started actively changing things and competing with one another. Very few evolved lifestyles withstand the test of time. For this reason, nature doesn&#8217;t just select &#8220;the best lifestyles&#8221; for life. <strong>Life invested in a general purpose platform to make the search for new lifestyles more efficient</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at how the platform works. A cell can be thought of as a kind of microscopic robot. The “programming” for that robot is stored in DNA, which is surrounded by a complex mechanism that reads that data and uses it to produce the form and behavior of the organism. Each cell has a very limited capacity for intelligence, but they’re very good at working together. Like a sort of “autonomous smart matter,” they collaborate by the trillions, which is how every form of intelligence on this planet is made. There’s no reason to think there’s an upper limit to what can be built in this way.</p>



<p>What makes this possible is the protein-synthesis engine at the core of every cell. The nucleus of a cell is a bit like the brain of a human, in that it’s a specialized sort of computer that’s “in control” of the cell. It’s surrounded by the cell’s body, which serves as the interface between the program in its nucleus and the outside world. This is where the similarity ends, though, because the nucleus and the brain are very different kinds of computing devices.</p>



<p>The nucleus works by continuously handling requests, looking up protein recipes, and sending those recipes back out to the cell for construction. A cell can make an <em>astonishing</em> variety of complex molecules this way. These proteins are what make up the cell, its inner workings, and outward behaviors. They serve as building material, messages, tools, or even nano-robots that move about within the cell, manipulating other molecules, and doing useful work all on their own. Sometimes a single protein can serve <em>all</em> of these roles, depending on context. They interact with each other in a vast complex network of activity that keeps the cell alive.</p>



<p>These cellular mechanisms continuously send messages <em>back</em> to the nucleus, reporting on the cell’s health, situation, and needs. The nucleus uses this information to figure out what proteins to make next, adapting the cell’s makeup and behavior to fit the circumstances. For instance, <em>E. coli</em> bacteria normally feed on glucose sugar, but they can eat lactose instead, if that’s what’s available. When that happens, the cell reports to the nucleus that it’s running low on energy and what molecules are around. The nucleus then decides to switch some genes on and off, which instructs the cell to make different enzymes, which results in different cascades of chemical reactions, in order to digest and use the lactose. By reading the DNA differently, the nucleus shifts the whole cell from one lifestyle to another, in response to a changing environment.</p>



<p>Another way to think of the nucleus is as the <em>engine</em> of the cell. The proteins it makes drive all the chemical reactions that keep the cell alive. Ultimately, everything the cell does is about collecting the energy and raw materials to feed that engine and keep it running. This is the cell’s metabolism. When the engine runs faster, the organism becomes more active, moving, “thinking,” and reacting with speed and vigor, but quickly burning through its energy stores. When it runs slowly, the cell becomes sluggish and conserves its energy. If it ever comes to a full stop, the cell dies, or, in special cases, enters suspended animation. In other words: cells live to make proteins, and making proteins is what makes cells alive.</p>



<p>DNA is where the cell keeps all these protein recipes, but the DNA molecule itself is completely inert. It just carries information, like a computer memory card. It can’t do anything by itself, and certainly can’t make a <em>body</em> from scratch. <strong>To build an organism, you need a cell to interpret the gene sequence and do the construction</strong>. This is why cells always reproduce by splitting in two. The daughter cell is basically just half of the parent cell, full of the same soup of proteins and organelles, in a fully operational state. The only part that’s really “new” are the DNA molecules in the nucleus, freshly copied from the parent(s). Any changes in that DNA program will only manifest when the daughter cell sends a message to the nucleus and gets a different response back than its parent would have seen.</p>



<p>That means that every cell has the crucial responsibility of reading and writing those DNA programs. They contain every useful protein recipe life has discovered, and must be actively maintained over generations or those recipes will be lost. But what does life actually record in the DNA? Geneticists say DNA is made of four amino acid base pairs (A, G, T, C), which are grouped into triplets called “codons” that serve as instructions for protein synthesis. That makes it seem “natural,” as if that were the only way to do it. The truth is, the code is totally arbitrary. Life made it up. By trial and error, life invented a coding scheme. It gave meaning to those molecules and all the ways they can be combined. <strong>The programming language of life was invented by life. It wasn’t the beginning, but a tool that cells <em>made</em> to manage their behaviors, learn new ones, and pass knowledge to future generations</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s put that all together. A cell is a programmable micro-robot (in technical jargon, a “universal automaton”), capable of making virtually any protein and living virtually any lifestyle. In a sense, a cell is not just one organism, but potentially an infinite variety of organisms, depending on the programming in its nucleus. But how does the program get written? Life had to do all the work itself, without a programmer in the traditional sense. A cell has no mind with which to analyze its DNA and understand what it means. It cannot imagine the consequences of any changes to its programming, or test them out to make sure they are safe. And yet, somehow life invented a programming language and used it to write countless programs and build the full diversity of organisms we see on Earth.</p>



<p>We’ll delve into the details of how this happened in the next two blog posts. At a high level, though, there are two main parts of the story:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Life is self-made.</strong> Each cell is relatively simple and mindless, but working together in huge populations over long stretches of time, they develop their own programming. How they do it is quite different from how a human programmer would, but from a collective perspective, there are also some surprising similarities.</li>



<li><strong>Life influences future generations.</strong> Organisms don’t just worry about their own survival, they put an <em>enormous</em> amount of time and energy into influencing the next generation for the better. Science is only beginning to understand this, but it offers the tantalizing possibility that, in some limited sense, life might steer its own evolution.</li>
</ul>



<p>More on that next month.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m trying something a little different. Over the next few months, I will publish a three-part series about evolution from some (hopefully) new perspectives. This represents how I, personally, have come to think about evolution. I’ll go beyond the scientific consensus to talk about some ideas that are uncommon and controversial. I believe I have a compelling story that’s consistent with established science, but this isn’t authoritative yet. In fact, I’m being a little bold and spicy in the hope of attracting criticism and feedback. I hope these ideas will frame my PhD research, so I’m excited to learn what people find interesting, useful, confusing, or problematic.</p>



<p>I’m doing this because I believe the way we usually talk about evolution obscures what&#8217;s really going on. In the “survival of the fittest” story, an individual organism lives its life, making choices that either help it thrive and reproduce, or not. If it’s successful, it will attract mates and have many children who are like them, but a little different, perhaps better. To follow the path of evolution, we then pick a new individual, maybe one of that organism’s children with a beneficial mutation, and see where life goes from there.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s an oversimplification of Darwin’s theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. It lacks nuance, but it’s basically correct and useful. The problem is, it’s just one way of looking at the situation, shaped by human bias. Each person is a multicellular individual that lives a long time and reproduces sexually, so it’s natural that we look at evolution from that perspective. But when it comes to life on Earth, we are the exception. The vast majority of life comes in colonies of single-celled organisms, living short lives and reproducing asexually. From that perspective, the process of evolution looks very different.</p>



<p>The next three blog posts will explore that perspective. <strong>Part one</strong> describes the cell as a tiny robot that uses DNA to program its own behavior. This will illustrate what it means to evolve such a program, and what purpose the program serves. <strong>Part two</strong> shifts perspective from a single cell to a population of cells over time. This illustrates how when individual cells work together in large numbers, they program themselves, using an evolutionary algorithm much more powerful than mere random variation and selection. Finally, <strong>part three</strong> discusses the complex ways that life influences the design of its own programming, and effectively “steers” its evolution, in a blind sort of way.</p>



<p>The first post goes out today, and you can read it <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/universal-automata/">here</a>. I’ll release the other two installments in September and November. Each post is written to stand on its own, but together they tell a more powerful story, so I hope you’ll come back for more!</p>

<p>There’s something very romantic about “the Age of Dinosaurs.” Before the familiar ecosystems of today, there was a completely different world order. Bizarre and fantastic species, strange environments and ways of living, another planet buried in the past of our familiar home. Yet, that was just one stage in our planet’s evolution—one that’s relatively recent, and similar to our own. It’s easy to forget that amniotes (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and the like) have only been around for 10% of Earth’s history, or about 300 million years. By comparison, single cells were the only life on Earth for 2.8 <em>billion</em> years. We sometimes hand wave over that period and say “not much happened,” but in that time life somehow went from accidentally self-perpetuating chemical reactions to swarms of intelligent microrobots that coordinate by the trillions to dominate every corner of the globe. This was the time of some of life’s most important and profound innovations, including essential concepts that made large-scale life possible.</p>



<p>About four billion years ago, the molten Earth finally cooled enough to form a solid crust of rock that could hold liquid water. Just 200 million years later, we see evidence of cells in the fossil record. In other words, it took just 200 million years for chance chemical reactions to become “self aware.” These early cells had no minds, of course, but they had membranes separating their insides from their outsides. They actively monitored and maintained the delicate balance of metabolic processes keeping them alive. Yet that was just the beginning of the journey, the basic foundation that made all the rest possible. From there, it took cells another billion years to cover the planet’s surface, and they’ve been ubiquitous ever since.</p>



<p>In that time, not much happened… from the human perspective. If you visited Earth at the time, it would look pretty boring. You might notice some slimes or biofilms, but you’d need a microscope to really appreciate that as “life.” Yet, gradually, microbes terraformed the planet. They found and exploited every available source of energy, and developed a molecular toolkit for extracting resources from a dead world. They mined useful molecules from the air, water, and rock, transforming and concentrating them for future generations. They remade the atmosphere, filling it with volatile oxygen, providing an energy-dense fuel for organisms to come. They created a protective layer of ozone that blocked DNA-frying radiation and made land habitable for the first time. This would all be invisible to a human observer because it happened so <em>slowly</em>, but the scale and significance of this transformation is incredible, especially coming from such tiny, mindless lifeforms. How could this happen?</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest misconception about evolution is that simpler forms of life are “less evolved” than we are. The reality is that everything alive today has a common ancestor, and has had just as much time to evolve from there. Even bacteria are highly sophisticated organisms. They sense light, heat, motion, and chemicals. They sniff out food and resources, and navigate their environment. They hunt and evade predators. They learn and remember. They coordinate their behaviors with pheromone signaling. They sustain themselves, repair themselves, and make copies of themselves. In many ways, a single bacterium is <em>vastly</em> more impressive than anything made by humans. Like all life, they’re very good at what they do, but appreciating that intelligence means taking their perspective, which is rather difficult for humans.</p>



<p>For example, microbes experience evolution quite differently than we do. For humans, it’s a very abstract concept. It only matters on the scale of <em>many</em> generations, which may take thousands or millions of years. In contrast, a colony of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. They evolve over the course of hours, so for them it’s a real-time problem solving tool. There’s a fascinating experiment where bacteria took just eleven days to incrementally evolve resistance to antibiotics at a concentration 1,000 times what was originally a lethal dose. You can actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE&amp;t=92s&amp;ab_channel=ScienceNews">watch</a> as the population discovers innovations that allow them to resist the poison and expand into new territory. When they do, they get a brief moment of total freedom, spreading unhindered until they start to get competition from their fellow mutants for the limited space remaining.</p>



<p><em>This</em> is what cells are really good at. Not just living one lifestyle, but finding new lifestyles. In a crowded, competitive world, the best way for an organism to set itself apart is novelty: gaining access to an empty niche, or finding some innovative way to out-compete its neighbors. Doing this over, and over, and over again is how life managed to colonize every corner of this planet, from underwater volcanic vents, to Antarctic ice, to your gut. Exploration and creativity is also critical for long-term survival. On a geologic time scale, niches and lifestyles are transient, coming and going as changes in environmental conditions and competition from other species reshape the landscape. Staying alive means constantly adapting and trying new strategies. On a fundamental level, this is what life does.</p>



<p>This perspective helps explain one of the strange things about cells. Every living thing we know—every single cell, even the most ancient and primitive Archaea—has a general-purpose design. At their core, there’s a 3D printer for proteins, capable of mass producing molecules in a mind-boggling variety of shapes. Those proteins form the structure and machinery of the cell, help digest various food stuffs, neutralize toxins, and perform computations. Importantly, this 3D printer doesn’t just produce every protein a cell needs to live. It can make <em>any</em> protein, from any species, even proteins that haven’t been discovered yet. This would be massively overkill for living in any single niche, but it’s the ideal tool for conquering <em>every</em> niche. This complex, general-purpose cell design was so powerful that it out-competed and replaced everything simpler.</p>



<p>DNA mostly consists of programs for that 3D printer. It’s a collection of recipes for proteins, and cues for when to make them. Life hoards those recipes. They represent tools and behaviors that were once useful in the past. Right now, they might <em>not</em> be useful. They may even be harmful, disabled, and packed away where they can do no damage, but they aren’t forgotten. They lie dormant, waiting to be re-enabled on demand or by accident, just in case they might one day prove useful again. After all, who knows when the next global catastrophe will completely rewrite the rules of survival on this planet?</p>



<p>In other words, cells specialize in exploring the space of possible forms and lifestyles. They build up massive libraries of tools and strategies in their DNA. They continuously reprogram themselves, adapting to any conditions in order to find new niches. Macroscopic life, from butterflies to avocados to whales, is only possible because of this polymorphic quality of cells. They are the secret ingredient. They are like “smart matter” that can act autonomously, respond in real time, take on any shape, produce any chemical, and implement any behavior. Once you have that, it’s relatively easy to program those cells to construct just the right mix of forms, organized in just the right way, to make something much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>I hope this conveys some of why I find cellular intelligence so exciting. Humans are most interested in human things, so it’s very easy to ignore the incredibly alien lives happening right under our noses. Yet, there’s so much to explore, and so much of what we are <em>is</em> that “alien” cellular intelligence. What do you think? Did this help you see single cells or life in general in a different light? Did this spark any questions or ideas? Anything you’d like to see me explore more in a future post? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(featuring illustrations by <a href="https://www.sarinamitchel.com/">Sarina Mitchel</a>)</p>



<p>Imagine your skull is a cockpit. A tiny You sits in front of a view screen and a dashboard, watching the world go by, pulling levers, and pushing buttons. Your body is a robot, precision engineered to protect you, keep you informed, and respond to your every command. It’s a complex and sophisticated machine, but not intelligent. It does what you tell it to do. Its shape and function were exquisitely designed by God or evolution, and encoded as DNA. That molecule represents the full blueprints for the machine. Now that the design has been perfected, all you have to do is follow the instructions step by step to make the ultimate human tool: your body.</p>



<p>That was probably very easy to imagine. The concept shows up all the time in the media, whether we’re talking about the literal giant robots from <em>Power Rangers</em>, or the psychological metaphors from movies like <em>Inside Out</em>. This way of conceiving the mind comes naturally to us, in part because that’s how it feels to be a person, sometimes. Great thinkers like René Descartes built whole philosophies around this duality of body and mind / soul. It has come to shape how our society works in many profound ways. Unfortunately, science tells a  different story.</p>



<p>Perhaps the first clue that something is off is how human-centric this picture is. Life was around for billions of years before people or brains came onto the scene. Even single-celled organisms perceive the world and quickly respond in ways that show awareness of their situation and how the world works, no brains necessary. When cells band together to make bodies, they often have tiny brains (like insects) or no brains at all (like plants). Humans are among the small minority of species who are entirely dependent on their big brains for survival. Does that mean that we’re one of the <em>only</em> intelligent species on this planet? Are all the others just empty robots with no one in the pilot seat?</p>



<p>Some might think of DNA as a blueprint that specifies every detail about how to build and operate a living thing, but the reality is much more complicated than that. It’s better to think of DNA as a family’s collection of cookbooks, passed on from generation to generation. They’re full of ingredient lists, recipes, and instructions. The family wouldn’t know how to cook at all without those books, so they’re critical to survival. They include all of the family’s daily staples and seasonal favorites. Even if, in theory, the family could get by on a more exotic diet, they don&#8217;t. Their cookbooks cover the full range of cuisine that they’re comfortable with, and they don’t often branch out.</p>



<p>And yet, there’s plenty of interpretation involved. What should the family cook for dinner tonight? Which recipes and books are more popular, and which go unused? How do they manage the pantry, and what do they do when they don’t have all the right ingredients? Just because the recipe says one thing, it doesn’t mean they have to do it that way. In fact, the recipe books are littered with sticky notes which suggest variations. They mark which parts of the recipe to skip, which ingredients to go heavy on, and recommend substitutions. The family can even mix and match parts from multiple recipes, or exchange recipes with friends to try something new.</p>



<p>This is getting a little too anthropomorphic. Cells don’t think about this sort of thing, because “thinking” isn’t how they do it. In reality, we&#8217;re talking about molecules, banging around together in chaotic but reliable ways according to the laws of physics. They don’t have any “intentions,” except maybe the ones implicit in their evolved recipes. But this is how they behave. Each cell is autonomous, responding to the environment with spontaneity. The DNA serves as a reference book, not a program. It isn’t even used to construct the cell. Remember, cells reproduce by dividing in half. Nature never builds a cell from scratch. Instead, half the family takes half the house, half the pantry, and a full copy of all the cookbooks. They wave goodbye, then carry on living as they always have, just as a separate cell with a separate fate.</p>



<p>DNA is a crucial resource, representing countless generations of acquired knowledge and wisdom. But it is <em>not</em> a blueprint, and that’s critical to how evolution works. Every cell and every organism lives an open-ended life, doing their best to survive with what they’re given. When circumstances change, life improvises and diversifies. The same genes may cause different behaviors in new contexts. When one way of living is blocked, old neglected genes may resurface, bringing back old ways of living. In stressful times, cells increase their own mutation rates, taking a risk to generate new variations which might get them out of a bind. This makes life far more flexible than if every aspect of design and behavior was explicitly laid out in the genome.</p>



<p>This becomes even more important for organisms with complex bodies. If DNA really was a blueprint, then building a human body would require precisely positioning and configuring each one of 37 trillion cells. Even if that process was 99.99999% perfect, there’d still be millions of errors. Luckily, this process is bottom-up, with each cell coordinating with its neighbors to figure out their relationships, what needs doing, and how to work together. That makes errors much more tolerable, since one cell can take over for another, or work around whatever defect is in the way. If the body were built from literal blueprints with no room for improvisation, then even a single cell out of line could potentially throw off everything that comes after. Errors would be much more likely to cascade and accumulate, potentially becoming fatal.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most astounding thing is that each cell in a body has a copy of the <em>same</em> set of cookbooks. They just read them differently, adopting a lifestyle to fit their place in the body. A bit like people in a society, each cell in the body tries to play its own role, and many different roles interact to make something much more than the sum of its parts. From many independent observations, decisions, and actions made locally by each cell, higher order structures and behaviors emerge. Cells make up organs and bodies. They manage bodily resources, capture and aggregate information about the world, and respond in coordinated ways. They perform extraordinary feats, like moving 37 trillion cells through space, gracefully and without damage.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a swarm of nanobots, clinging together to form a giant mecha. This mecha has evolved to do something useful, but its shape and function are only loosely defined. Each nanobot is a mindless automaton, operating independently within some constraints that are just specific enough for it to serve some purpose within the greater whole. These nanobots cluster to form dynamic structures, nested machines made of machines, in constant motion, building up to massive size and complexity. In order to manage this unwieldy bulk, the nanobots weave together into a neuromorphic computer. This specialized sub-processor simulates the world in real time, predicts what comes next, and carefully coordinates the timing of activity across this whole vast assemblage.</p>



<p>Part of that computer is responsible for imagining what it’s like to <em>be</em> the giant mecha. Its whole existence is within a simulated environment, extrapolated from the trillions of tiny motes of sensory data provided by the swarm. It watches the behaviors and emotions produced by the swarm, and uses them to tell stories about the values, needs, and intentions that guide the mecha&#8217;s behavior. It makes educated guesses about what the mecha will do next, which the swarm uses as hints to guide their behavior. As the only part of the mecha that is self-aware, and having no direct perception of the nanobots themselves, this simulation imagines itself to be in charge, and assumes the whole arrangement is for its benefit.</p>



<p>I know this is an uncomfortable image for many people. It’s not warm and fuzzy. It probably feels strange, maybe even disgusting. It’s not how we like to think of ourselves. However, “strange” and “disgusting” are also excellent words to describe living bodies, in all their infinite variety. Human beings are machines made of meat and bone. They are also unique souls, with meaningful lives, profound experiences, and extraordinary talents. The challenge is to see this not as a contradiction, but as two sides of the same coin. We can be the pilot in the cockpit, <em>and</em> the nanobot swarm.</p>



<p>What do you think? Is this a useful way of thinking about mind and body? Have you ever noticed moments when your body dominates your mind and the &#8220;pilot in the cockpit&#8221; illusion seems to break down? Or do you think I&#8217;m under-selling the power and importance of the brain? Is it right to say that &#8220;nobody&#8217;s home&#8221; in life without a brain, or is it more complicated than that? Any questions about this &#8220;cookbook&#8221; metaphor and what&#8217;s <em>really</em> going on in the cell? I&#8217;d love to hear from you. Please, join the conversation in the comments section.</p>
