<p>Life has been steadily driving towards greater and greater intelligence, eventually leading to human beings, who are the very pinnacle of this trend. Our superior minds are what separate us from the animals. They empower us to make a world of human flourishing, and justify our dominion over the planet. These tropes about intelligence are so common in our culture, they almost sound self-evident. Yet, I&#8217;ll argue that they&#8217;re completely wrong. These ideas are enticing because they appeal to our pride and our sense of specialness, but this way of thinking is destroying our world. So, let’s break down these myths and talk about what intelligence is <em>not</em>.</p>



<p>One problem with this story is it presents intelligence as a linear thing. Life started out dumb, and it gradually got smarter and smarter. In a sense, this is true. More intelligent life is more complicated, so it takes longer to evolve. But life doesn’t evolve <em>towards</em> anything, it evolves in all directions, finding and filling every niche available. Monkeys are brilliant at navigating tree branches and spotting ripe fruit. Trees are brilliant at producing the right amount of fruit at the right moment to use local resources efficiently and maximize the spread of their seeds. Yeasts are brilliant at performing alchemy on that fruit, transmuting sugar into alcohol, which the monkeys love. These are all different kinds of intelligence, and none is “better” than the other because they’re all contextual and interdependent. Every instance of intelligence looks different, because it’s adapted to a unique lifestyle.</p>



<p>We live a very complicated lifestyle that depends on our big brains, so we tend to think that more intelligence is better, but that’s just not the case. Some of the simplest, dumbest organisms on Earth are also the most successful. Microbes, fungus, and plants make up something like 99.5% of Earth’s biomass, while animals (the “smart”ones) make up the rest. Being smart is metabolically expensive. Taking time to think can mean missing a moment of opportunity. Sometimes real intelligence is knowing when a mindless strategy works best. If anything, humans are a great example of how intelligence can backfire. We’ve used our intelligence to make civilization, which is amazing! But in doing so, we accidentally drove many species to extinction, exhausted resources we depend on, and destabilized the global climate. Our kind of big-brained intelligence is a high risk, high reward strategy.</p>



<p>This brings us to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of intelligence. The problem with a word like “pinnacle” is it suggests we are the <em>ultimate</em> form—the thing life’s been building up to, all this time. But we’re not the end of anything. We’re still evolving, and it’s unclear whether our intelligence will go up or down from here. We’re also not the only ones. There are a handful of species that have gone “all in” on the strategy of super intelligence. You know, elephants, dolphins, octopi, the usual suspects. Humans may, in fact, be the smartest of them all, but since intelligence is so contextual, it’s hard to say. Maybe dolphins are <em>more</em> intelligent than us, it just looks different in an ocean species with no hands?</p>



<p>It may seem obvious that human intelligence is something more and different from those other species. We invented the wheel, New York, wars and so on. But that really isn’t because we as individuals are so smart. This is made clear by the tragic case of “wild children,” who grow up without parents or any human community. In the few cases we’ve observed, these children were described as animalistic, violent, and cognitively impaired. They were never able to recover or integrate into human society. Our brains alone do <em>not</em> set us apart from animals. Our <em>society</em> does, and that’s a separate thing, that evolved <em>after</em> our big brains. We’re smarter than other animals not because of our biology, but because of the vast library of practical knowledge and resources that we share with one another.</p>



<p><em>That’s</em> what sets us apart: other species can’t access human culture. In a sense, that&#8217;s because those species are less intelligent; to fully appreciate human society, you need language and abstract thought, which many species lack completely. Yet some species <em>thrive</em> in human society anyway. By being useful (like wheat), or charismatic (like dogs), or sneaky (like raccoons) other species live with us and shape our human world. That’s because nature does not set humans apart from other animals. We set <em>ourselves</em> apart from other life by building walls, by excluding them from our world, to the extent that we can. We decide what plants and animals are pets, food, or pests. Other species don&#8217;t need language to live in human society if we choose to accommodate them. We can coexist with nature in community, as many human societies have, and still do. Or, we can perpetuate the myth that we are special to justify excluding and exploiting nature instead.</p>



<p>And, ultimately, that’s the problem with this notion of intelligence: we use it to draw a line between friend and resource. If smarter is better—if our <em>intelligence</em> is what sets us apart from other life, and gives us the right to exploit that life however we see fit—then where do we draw the line? Should smarter people get more rights and privileges than dumber ones? Is a disabled person no better than an animal? Should we simply recycle the feeble minded from our population? This line of thinking is revolting, and it only makes sense if you believe these myths about intelligence. Similarly, if anything less than human is just a dumb resource for us to exploit, why not pave the planet? What’s wrong with processing all of that biomass, every living thing on Earth, into fuel and plastics? I think intuitively we know why: life has a right to exist, and losing all those diverse and beautiful kinds of intelligence would be tragic.</p>



<p>I’m excited to live in a time when our understanding of intelligence is changing so rapidly. It’s hard to define the word, just because we have so many examples that pull in different directions, and seem to contradict one another. Intelligence is <em>many</em> things, and we’re still fleshing out the full picture. Yet, every day we see more clearly that our old conceptions of intelligence that put human beings on a pedestal were <em>wrong</em>, and, more importantly, that they are at the root of so much injustice and destruction. So, while these tropes are still everywhere around us, shape the way our world works, and may still <em>feel</em> intuitively true, I urge you to reject them. We must move on, and embrace a more expansive view, one that doesn’t start from the premise of who to exclude.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">(This month&#8217;s featured image is a <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/031/01G77PKB8NKR7S8Z6HBXMYATGJ">photo of the Carina Nebula</a> taken by NASA&#8217;s James Webb telescope. It&#8217;s a vast cloud of gas and dust, slowly condensing, with hundreds of stars visible in the background behind it. The colorized image almost looks like orange mountains with a blue mist rising from them, set on a black background with bright, six-sided starbursts.)</p>



<p>Normally, when we talk about evolution, we mean what life does. It’s Darwin’s magic formula. You need reproduction. You need to pass on a copy of your genes, with a little variation, so things don’t just stay the same. Natural selection will weed out the less fit individuals, so they have fewer kids. The more fit individuals become more prevalent and, over time, life as a whole evolves to be more fit. Yet, this isn’t a very satisfying story. For one thing, how did it begin? Did life just start evolving out of the blue? I think story is more compelling if we think about evolution a bit more abstractly. In a sense, the physical universe itself evolves. It doesn’t have reproduction and inheritance, but it sure does have variation and selection, and this has caused it to change dramatically over the course of history.</p>



<p>For the first 370,000 years or so, all of space was filled with a boring, homogeneous cloud of energy and plasma. That universe is now extinct, and for one simple reason: it was unstable. In our universe, stability is the ultimate definition of “fitness.” What persists, exists. Patterns of matter and energy that get generated more often and stick around longer become more prevalent. Those that are rare and fragile exist only fleetingly. The plasma universe is gone because gravity causes matter to clump together. It was like a pencil, balanced on its tip. As soon as it became just a little unbalanced, it rapidly fell farther and farther away from that delicate equilibrium. Plasma condensed into molecules, gas clouds, and stars.</p>



<p>Of course, evolution needs variation to work. To find what&#8217;s better, you need to weed out what&#8217;s worse. For life, reproduction is the engine of variation, but that isn’t necessary if you have unimaginably vast scale. The universe started out with very little variation, but it steadily increased as matter interacted with itself. Gravity caused hydrogen molecules to group together in uneven clumps, and held them there. They sat around for millions of years, slowly growing bigger, until the force of their own weight ignited a fusion reaction. The gas clouds became stars, and in their cores new elements were born. The universe’s population gradually became more diverse.</p>



<p>That’s the counterintuitive thing about stability: it can generate diversity. When patterns become more numerous, and they stick around for longer, chaos starts to kick in. Every star and every planet is a little different. They have unique histories and influences and opportunities. They might be richer in this element or that one, bigger or smaller, hotter or colder, more or less affected by collisions. This diversity only compounds over time, as these objects smash together and interact in complex ways. The longer they stick around, the more they change, recombine, and become more elaborate.</p>



<p>So, for 13 billion years, the universe evolved. Its population became stranger and more complicated. Today we have about a hundred “naturally occurring” elements that didn’t exist at first, but had to evolve through multiple generations of stars fusing atoms, exploding violently, and gradually reforming. We have many <em>kinds</em> of stars, planets, solar systems, and galaxies, that support an astonishing variety of chemical processes that have had a very, very long time to develop. They produce “primordial soups,” pocket environments full of useful molecules for life, a steady energy source, and self-perpetuating chemical reactions. We think this happened at least once to seed all life on Earth, but it may in fact be very common.</p>



<p>I think this story is an essential foundation for understanding evolution as life does it. Because life didn’t start this process. The universe provides energy and raw materials in vast amounts. It provides the chaos and entropy that drives seemingly random variation, and the slow, continual breaking down that causes natural selection to prefer stable, commonly made forms. The laws of physics cause the universe to evolve towards stability, diversity, and complexity, at least for a while, until it starts to wind down again and settle into entropy. Life merely <em>constrains</em> that process, making it more efficient and productive, for the simple reason that matter that does so becomes more prevalent.</p>



<p>In these primordial soups, some chemical systems evolved to enclose themselves in bubbles, protecting delicate reactions from the outside world. These self-made &#8220;individuals&#8221; evolved regular cycles of reproduction, explicitly making copies of themselves rather than waiting for the right reactants to come together again by chance. They evolved DNA to constrain these copies, and make them more precise reproductions of the original. They evolved sophisticated error checking, which made the copies more robust and reliable. But this also gave life the power to <em>manage</em> variation across generations, and thus shape its own evolution. Life evolved sex to further manage variation, accelerating innovation by sharing genetic recipes across lineages. Life evolved an <em>astonishing variety</em> of sexual and reproductive practices, allowing it to evolve in different ways, with different patterns of variation and selection, each suited to a different range of environments and lifestyles.</p>



<p>The physical Universe evolves—in the most primitive way imaginable, but it still produces stability and complexity in a <em>vast</em> number of diverse forms. It generates the seeds of life, without any guidance or direction. Life evolves differently, because it constrains this process, making it discrete, digital, and managed. This started very simply, just discovering chemical reactions that isolate and maintain themselves. But perhaps this is the origin of what we think of as “intelligence” or “agency”? Without noticing, matter became “opinionated,” preferring certain forms and acting explicitly to promote them. From there, life’s “opinions” about itself only became more demanding and elaborate.</p>



<p>We often present evolution as one simple story, but there are many ways to evolve. Evolution is more like a general principle than a specific algorithm. Even just life as we know it, all based on the DNA molecule, has invented an <em>astonishing</em> variety of different and complex ways of evolving. Bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals <em>use</em> DNA differently. They grow, behave, and reproduce in <em>completely</em> different ways. How many other ways might there be to do it? When we present evolution as a single, constant thing, we limit our imagination. Evolution evolves, and it takes as many diverse forms as it makes.</p>

<p>There’s something very romantic about “the Age of Dinosaurs.” Before the familiar ecosystems of today, there was a completely different world order. Bizarre and fantastic species, strange environments and ways of living, another planet buried in the past of our familiar home. Yet, that was just one stage in our planet’s evolution—one that’s relatively recent, and similar to our own. It’s easy to forget that amniotes (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and the like) have only been around for 10% of Earth’s history, or about 300 million years. By comparison, single cells were the only life on Earth for 2.8 <em>billion</em> years. We sometimes hand wave over that period and say “not much happened,” but in that time life somehow went from accidentally self-perpetuating chemical reactions to swarms of intelligent microrobots that coordinate by the trillions to dominate every corner of the globe. This was the time of some of life’s most important and profound innovations, including essential concepts that made large-scale life possible.</p>



<p>About four billion years ago, the molten Earth finally cooled enough to form a solid crust of rock that could hold liquid water. Just 200 million years later, we see evidence of cells in the fossil record. In other words, it took just 200 million years for chance chemical reactions to become “self aware.” These early cells had no minds, of course, but they had membranes separating their insides from their outsides. They actively monitored and maintained the delicate balance of metabolic processes keeping them alive. Yet that was just the beginning of the journey, the basic foundation that made all the rest possible. From there, it took cells another billion years to cover the planet’s surface, and they’ve been ubiquitous ever since.</p>



<p>In that time, not much happened… from the human perspective. If you visited Earth at the time, it would look pretty boring. You might notice some slimes or biofilms, but you’d need a microscope to really appreciate that as “life.” Yet, gradually, microbes terraformed the planet. They found and exploited every available source of energy, and developed a molecular toolkit for extracting resources from a dead world. They mined useful molecules from the air, water, and rock, transforming and concentrating them for future generations. They remade the atmosphere, filling it with volatile oxygen, providing an energy-dense fuel for organisms to come. They created a protective layer of ozone that blocked DNA-frying radiation and made land habitable for the first time. This would all be invisible to a human observer because it happened so <em>slowly</em>, but the scale and significance of this transformation is incredible, especially coming from such tiny, mindless lifeforms. How could this happen?</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest misconception about evolution is that simpler forms of life are “less evolved” than we are. The reality is that everything alive today has a common ancestor, and has had just as much time to evolve from there. Even bacteria are highly sophisticated organisms. They sense light, heat, motion, and chemicals. They sniff out food and resources, and navigate their environment. They hunt and evade predators. They learn and remember. They coordinate their behaviors with pheromone signaling. They sustain themselves, repair themselves, and make copies of themselves. In many ways, a single bacterium is <em>vastly</em> more impressive than anything made by humans. Like all life, they’re very good at what they do, but appreciating that intelligence means taking their perspective, which is rather difficult for humans.</p>



<p>For example, microbes experience evolution quite differently than we do. For humans, it’s a very abstract concept. It only matters on the scale of <em>many</em> generations, which may take thousands or millions of years. In contrast, a colony of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. They evolve over the course of hours, so for them it’s a real-time problem solving tool. There’s a fascinating experiment where bacteria took just eleven days to incrementally evolve resistance to antibiotics at a concentration 1,000 times what was originally a lethal dose. You can actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE&amp;t=92s&amp;ab_channel=ScienceNews">watch</a> as the population discovers innovations that allow them to resist the poison and expand into new territory. When they do, they get a brief moment of total freedom, spreading unhindered until they start to get competition from their fellow mutants for the limited space remaining.</p>



<p><em>This</em> is what cells are really good at. Not just living one lifestyle, but finding new lifestyles. In a crowded, competitive world, the best way for an organism to set itself apart is novelty: gaining access to an empty niche, or finding some innovative way to out-compete its neighbors. Doing this over, and over, and over again is how life managed to colonize every corner of this planet, from underwater volcanic vents, to Antarctic ice, to your gut. Exploration and creativity is also critical for long-term survival. On a geologic time scale, niches and lifestyles are transient, coming and going as changes in environmental conditions and competition from other species reshape the landscape. Staying alive means constantly adapting and trying new strategies. On a fundamental level, this is what life does.</p>



<p>This perspective helps explain one of the strange things about cells. Every living thing we know—every single cell, even the most ancient and primitive Archaea—has a general-purpose design. At their core, there’s a 3D printer for proteins, capable of mass producing molecules in a mind-boggling variety of shapes. Those proteins form the structure and machinery of the cell, help digest various food stuffs, neutralize toxins, and perform computations. Importantly, this 3D printer doesn’t just produce every protein a cell needs to live. It can make <em>any</em> protein, from any species, even proteins that haven’t been discovered yet. This would be massively overkill for living in any single niche, but it’s the ideal tool for conquering <em>every</em> niche. This complex, general-purpose cell design was so powerful that it out-competed and replaced everything simpler.</p>



<p>DNA mostly consists of programs for that 3D printer. It’s a collection of recipes for proteins, and cues for when to make them. Life hoards those recipes. They represent tools and behaviors that were once useful in the past. Right now, they might <em>not</em> be useful. They may even be harmful, disabled, and packed away where they can do no damage, but they aren’t forgotten. They lie dormant, waiting to be re-enabled on demand or by accident, just in case they might one day prove useful again. After all, who knows when the next global catastrophe will completely rewrite the rules of survival on this planet?</p>



<p>In other words, cells specialize in exploring the space of possible forms and lifestyles. They build up massive libraries of tools and strategies in their DNA. They continuously reprogram themselves, adapting to any conditions in order to find new niches. Macroscopic life, from butterflies to avocados to whales, is only possible because of this polymorphic quality of cells. They are the secret ingredient. They are like “smart matter” that can act autonomously, respond in real time, take on any shape, produce any chemical, and implement any behavior. Once you have that, it’s relatively easy to program those cells to construct just the right mix of forms, organized in just the right way, to make something much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>I hope this conveys some of why I find cellular intelligence so exciting. Humans are most interested in human things, so it’s very easy to ignore the incredibly alien lives happening right under our noses. Yet, there’s so much to explore, and so much of what we are <em>is</em> that “alien” cellular intelligence. What do you think? Did this help you see single cells or life in general in a different light? Did this spark any questions or ideas? Anything you’d like to see me explore more in a future post?
