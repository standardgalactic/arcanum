<p>I just published a new coding project! If you&#8217;ve been following along, this is the &#8220;grown up&#8221; version of a <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/i-built-a-thing/">demo project</a> I posted last year.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s further exploration of what I call an ‚Äúepigenetic algorithm.‚Äù It‚Äôs inspired by a simple observation: in living cells, the process of evolution is actively managed by the cell, which itself is an evolved mechanism. Using evolution to optimize evolution seems like a powerful trick, so I‚Äôm trying to reproduce it in small-scale AI experiments. I hope to make evolutionary computing more open-ended, more successful in vast search spaces, and less biased by the programmer. In this case, I‚Äôm generating cool looking Game of Life simulations, but I hope to find many more practical applications in the future.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm not sure whether or not I will publish this as a work of science. It‚Äôs complicated and weird and there‚Äôs more work involved to make this a proper controlled experiment. As I learn more, I‚Äôm already thinking of other ways to explore this idea that might be more effective. So, for now, the plan is just to share the code and I may or may not revisit this later, depending on where my other leads take me.&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I gave a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZIYj8Rg4xPHukQ-Glk9_IZTgimEYh5dtWsyXrbkX9Dc/edit?usp=sharing">presentation</a> that covers the motivation, results, and challenges of this project for a technical audience.</p>



<p>You can also peruse the <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1">source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1-results">results</a> on GitHub.</p>



<p>Sorry this is less accessible than my usual blog posts! If you have any questions, just drop them in the comments, and I&#8217;ll happily answer them.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell‚Äôs Eye View of Evolution, Part 3</h1>



<p>(The image for this week is an illustration from Waddington&#8217;s 1957 paper <em>The Strategy of the Genes</em>, which is often used to explain canalization. It shows a landscape with shallow, forking grooves and a ball rolling down that landscape. Although the ball&#8217;s path isn&#8217;t fully determined, the existing impressions in the landscape constrain it to one of a few likely paths)</p>



<p>This is part three of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">the beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Darwin explained part of the great mystery of life: how complexity and intelligence can evolve from randomness. When DNA was discovered, this seemed to ‚Äúseal the deal.‚Äù DNA is the molecule that describes an organism‚Äôs nature, makes traits heritable, and carries mutations that are fodder for natural selection. That seemed to explain everything, at first, but I would argue that‚Äôs just the beginning. The DNA molecule itself lies at the heart of an incredibly complex system of processes that manage its care, use, and replication. These systems are collectively studied as ‚Äúepigenetics,‚Äù and science is just beginning to understand how they work and the impact they have on evolution.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs important to remember that DNA is an inert molecule that does nothing by itself. It needs a cell, a sort of organic micro-robot, to interpret that DNA and turn it into form and behavior. So, in a sense, every living thing is made up of <em>two</em> evolved programs: the DNA and the cell. Both are made of physical matter, which are subject to mutations. Both share the same selective pressures and reproductive fate. They evolve together, but they have different purposes. For the most part, the DNA program is what determines the organism‚Äôs lifestyle. The cell decides how to read that program, and how to make changes to that program over a lifetime and across generations.</p>



<p>One of the most important ways cells influence their own programming is through mutations. These happen naturally. As molecules bang against each other and get exposed to UV radiation from the sun, they sometimes spontaneously change shape. When those molecules represent critical information for a species‚Äô survival, that could be disastrous. For this reason, life invests a <em>ton</em> of energy into detecting and correcting errors. But this process is never perfect, and it can‚Äôt be. If life always copied itself <em>perfectly</em>, there would be no variation for selection to act on, and no evolution. Not only that, getting the error rate much lower than it already is would be prohibitively expensive. So, life strikes a healthy balance, allowing just enough mutation to be useful, but not enough to be dangerous.</p>



<p>Interestingly, that finely-tuned mutation rate is not constant and universal. There are some stretches of DNA that get <em>extra</em> error correction, always triple checked to ensure they stay as stable as possible. On the other hand, some stretches of DNA get actively shuffled, injecting randomness into things like the immune system, creating diversity that makes the population as a whole more robust. Perhaps most remarkable is that when cells get stressed out, they divert energy to other things, and away from error correction. This may just be an accidental side effect of the cell breaking down, but it might also be a survival strategy. To anthropomorphize, perhaps cells get creative when times are tough, trying out crazy ideas in the desperate hope that one might save them.</p>



<p>That said, a single DNA copying error can be <em>devastating</em>, so how does life cope? Remarkably, it can often just work around the problem. Living systems have a lot of redundancy, with many mutually supportive ways of doing basically the same thing. This leads to a phenomenon called ‚Äúcanalization.‚Äù The more critical some behavior is to life, and the longer it persists over many generations, the more redundancy builds up around it. This means that single errors may alter the behavior a little, change how it works, or make it less efficient, but probably won‚Äôt break it entirely.</p>



<p>When errors are too severe to recover from, an organism might just fail to thrive and die, but sometimes it actually notices the failure and decides to self-terminate. That may seem bizarre, but in multicellular organisms it makes a lot of sense. If the error is in a single cell, then removing that cell lets others take over its job. If the error would prevent the whole embryo from developing into a healthy adult, then it‚Äôs better to scrap the work in progress, recycle those materials, and start over from scratch. In other words, life has its own Quality Assurance processes, at multiple levels, which minimize investment into evolutionary dead ends.</p>



<p>Cells can also swap genes with each other, sharing useful recipes and trying them out in new combinations. Sex is one way to do it, aligning and remixing two complete genomes in an incredibly complex way that ensures the resulting DNA program is still valid. Simpler organisms like bacteria don‚Äôt do this, but swap genes in a much more free-form process called ‚Äúhorizontal gene transfer.‚Äù Basically, cells sometimes leave scraps of DNA lying around, or pick up those scraps and integrate them into their own programming. This can let a new behavior (like resisting some toxin or eating some food) spread very rapidly through a bacterial colony. Either way, randomly adopting genes <em>that have proven successful in another organism</em> is a much safer and more powerful way to create useful diversity than mutation alone.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that how a cell reads its DNA can change over a lifetime. Cells annotate their program with notes (ie, methylation) that indicate which recipes to avoid or use more of, depending on context. This is how single celled organisms adapt their behavior to a changing environment, and how cells in multicellular organisms differentiate into different kinds of tissues. Importantly, these notes are sometimes passed down across generations. For instance, an organism might survive near starvation by tuning down its metabolism, staying smaller, slower, and using less energy. That change is <em>heritable</em>. The next few generations will <em>also</em> have a slower metabolism, and if that serves them well, it could lead to long-lasting behavioral changes that eventually get encoded into the DNA itself.</p>



<p>So far, I‚Äôve talked about how life modifies itself, but it also modifies the environment. Organisms can build caches, nests, and tools that make life easier, and these get passed on, too, both as hand-me-downs and as lessons. Organisms form an ecosystem, full of mutualistic relationships between species that make life easier. Over geological time, this has transformed our planet from a barren rock to a lush world full of possibility. Life cultivates a supportive environment for future generations, shaping their behavior and evolutionary fitness. Child care might be the most visible example, protecting each new life when it‚Äôs most fragile, then sending off the new generation in a good direction informed by the parent‚Äôs life experience.</p>



<p>In the basic Darwinian story, evolution is something that <em>happens to</em> organisms. Accidental changes occur randomly, and nature chooses which ones will persist. But as we‚Äôve just seen, life does <em>not</em> leave things up to chance. Randomness plays a key role in biological evolution, but life manages that randomness carefully and uses it selectively. Life also does everything in its power to influence the next generation, in ways that are <em>not</em> random, but ‚Äúpurposeful‚Äù in a sense. A cell can‚Äôt understand <em>why</em> it does these things, but it does them for a reason: they worked well in the past, got selected for, and ended up in the cell‚Äôs programming.</p>



<p>This leads to a powerful realization: when it comes to influencing evolution, cells don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre doing, but many higher organisms <em>do</em>, at least a little. For instance, an animal can apply its full cognitive capacity, mind and all, to choosing a mate and raising its offspring. In this way, the cell has moved from blindly repeating what worked in the past, to making evolutionarily relevant decisions <em>intentionally</em>, with forethought and analysis. A dog may not understand genetics or think about the future of her species, but she <em>certainly</em> has strong opinions about who would make a good mate, when / where / how to raise her puppies, and which pups to give more or less attention to. She uses her senses, her instincts, and her big brain to make big decisions that shape evolution. She may not see the big picture, but she cares and makes informed choices nonetheless.</p>



<p>This helps explain the paradox of how life managed to become <em>so incredibly smart</em> just by randomly banging molecules together for a few billion years. Life may have started off randomly, but it quickly became more directed. <strong>Life </strong><strong><em>harnessed</em></strong><strong> Darwinian evolution to build a more powerful evolutionary algorithm, one that‚Äôs </strong><strong><em>opinionated</em></strong><strong> and shapes its own search space.</strong> At first, these evolution-shaping behaviors were simple and rigid, just tricks repeated by rote because they tended to make the next generation more successful. Then, as life became more intelligent, it started to apply that intelligence to shaping itself, creating a runaway process of recursive self-improvement.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The main takeaway from all this is that Darwin is the <em>beginning</em> of the story of evolution, not the end. Life uses all of its intelligent capacity to influence its own evolution. This led to a virtuous cycle. Increased intelligence gave life greater influence over evolution, which it used to become more intelligent, which gave it greater influence over evolution. For this reason, I think <strong>it‚Äôs better to say that life designed itself than to say it evolved by chance</strong>. The process of ‚Äúdesign‚Äù here was more stochastic, collective, and unthinking than we normally associate with that word, but in the end, the result is the same.</p>



<p>This story is still uncertain. The science around autonomous robots, intelligent collectives, and epigenetics is relatively new, and changing all the time. Plenty of biologists push back hard against the idea of any sort of agency or direction in evolution, partly because they‚Äôve been fighting against the theory of Intelligent Design for so long. Others believe we‚Äôre overdue for a <a href="https://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com/about-the-ees/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20extended%20evolutionary,i.e.%2C%20the%20modern%20synthesis).">new story about evolution</a>, and are trying to find the right narrative and the evidence to back it up. I hope my research into evolutionary algorithms might be a useful contribution to that effort. If you‚Äôd like to dig deeper into this topic, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526346279">Evolution in Four Dimensions</a> is an excellent overview of the field of epigenetics.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I‚Äôm very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell‚Äôs Eye View of Evolution, Part 2</h3>



<p>(this month&#8217;s image is a photo I took at Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, California. It consists of millions of tiny pebbles of polished sea glass in myriad colors. Each one is improbable to find at a beach, but all of them collectively tell the story of a larger-scale process that explains their presence‚Äîmany years of disposing of waste bottles nearby)</p>



<p>This is part two of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Every living cell is a universal automaton, capable of an infinite variety of forms and lifestyles. The cell itself determines the range of possibility‚Äîwhat proteins can it make, how will they integrate into the whole, and how will they shape the organism‚Äôs life? But within that space of possibility, the gene sequence is the program that determines what <em>specific</em> body to make, and how it should respond to a chaotic environment. That program is of the utmost importance, selecting one specialized lifestyle out of infinitely many possibilities, most of which would never work. But who wrote it?</p>



<p>Life did. Or, in other words, <em>cells</em> wrote the programming for cells, but it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to call them ‚Äúprogrammers.‚Äù A human programmer is a top-down problem solver. To modify some working software, I start by analyzing that system‚Äôs performance: what does it do, and how well? I then try to understand how the system works. I read its programming, and consider how that leads to the behavior I observe. I consider how the system might be better, what specific improvements I might make, and what consequences I expect. I design a change to the code, then tinker with it in a sandbox environment until it does exactly what I want with no surprises or side effects. Only when I‚Äôm satisfied do I push the code out for use in the real world.</p>



<p>How are cells supposed to do that? They don‚Äôt have a mind like I do. They monitor their own health and situation, but they can‚Äôt imagine themselves ‚Äúfrom the outside.‚Äù They don‚Äôt understand their lifestyle, their goals, or their relationships with the world except in terms of stimulus and response. They can execute short stretches of programming from their DNA, but they can‚Äôt examine the program as a whole, or imagine what would happen if they ran some other program instead. Mutations and cross-breeding cause the program to change, but cells can‚Äôt verify those changes in a safe testing environment. They can only make a new organism, release it into the world, and hope for the best.</p>



<p>This seems like a paradox, but only from the perspective of an individual cell. Life <em>never</em> exists as a lone individual. It always consists of diverse communities and ecosystems. So let‚Äôs take that perspective. Life isn‚Äôt a cell. Life is a <em>vast</em> collection of cells, an unimaginably huge number of concurrent individuals, living and dying continuously over billions of years. I like to think of it as a massively parallel computer. Life learns by accumulating and generalizing over the experiences of many lifetimes. It tries out many lifestyles simultaneously; whole different categories of lifestyles in different species and niches; many variations on a theme, among organisms of the same species. Whether any individual will be successful is hard to predict, because luck is such a huge factor. But by running the same experiments thousands of trillions of times over, life can get a relatively clear picture of what works and what doesn‚Äôt.</p>



<p>From this massively parallel perspective, each cell is a processor unit with two jobs. The first job is to live and reproduce. We normally think of that as ‚Äúthe purpose‚Äù of life, but from the collective perspective, it‚Äôs just the engine that keeps the system as a whole running. Individual lifetimes come and go rapidly and continuously like the cycles in a computer processor. The <em>second</em> job of each cell is <strong>to learn about the Universe and how to thrive in it, then integrate that information back into the system‚Äôs programming. That is life‚Äôs deeper purpose</strong>. Each cell has a very limited perspective and can only do this in a minimal way. But taken all together, vast numbers of cells can behave much more like a traditional programmer.</p>



<p>A cell has no understanding of what it does or how it fits into the big picture, but, in a sense, life as a whole <em>does</em>. Life consists of every cell, every lifestyle, every program that has worked so far, and all the dead ends that <em>aren‚Äôt</em> represented. That‚Äôs a tremendous amount of information about what the system does, which parts are performing better than others, and where there‚Äôs untapped potential. There‚Äôs no top-down designer, but this information, embodied in the population itself, still shapes the system‚Äôs evolution. Each cell acts selfishly, but by competing and collaborating with each other, life distributes resources to the parts of itself that are thriving in their niche, and encourages exploration of new lifestyles where opportunity lies.</p>



<p>The big difference between life and a human programmer is speculation. Humans <em>envision</em> the system as a whole and <em>imagine</em> where it might go. When I program a computer, I test ideas first in my mind and then in a virtual environment on the computer in order to avoid mistakes and dead ends. Life doesn‚Äôt do that, because its massively parallel, distributed design makes that impossible. There simply is no top-down view, no central authority to perceive and decide, no way to step out of the system for testing. Instead, life just tries everything. It tests code in production. It walks straight into failure rather than avoiding it. <strong>Death sorts what works from what doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why we usually think of cells as ‚Äúdumb‚Äù and humans as ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p><strong>It would be better to think of humans as more efficient</strong>, because in a sense what we do isn‚Äôt so different. We both generate lots of options, test them, winnow them down to the most successful, and iterate. I do it with simulations in my brain, life does it with matter in the physical Universe. From a computational perspective, that doesn‚Äôt matter. A computer can be realized with cogs, transistors, neurons, or a simulation inside another computer. The materials can be anything so long as the <em>functionality</em> is the same. As individual living animals, it seems tragic and absurd that life must test out ideas by letting things die on a massive scale. From life‚Äôs perspective, though, a single lifetime is just a brief use of materials and programming that will get recycled for future experiments. If it were conscious, life as a collective whole wouldn‚Äôt regret (or notice!) the death of an organism any more than we regret the death of one of our cells.</p>



<p>You might argue that the human programmer also has <em>foresight</em>. I don‚Äôt just try stuff at random, I have a sense of what might work and what probably won‚Äôt. I use trial and error, but I <em>prioritize</em> and focus my exploration. It‚Äôs tempting to say cells <em>don‚Äôt</em> do this, but that‚Äôs too dismissive. Cells are quite opinionated. DNA doesn‚Äôt contain a blueprint for an organism, but a bunch of recipes that the cell can choose between depending on context. Cells must decide how to act. Evolution has equipped them with a wide variety of strategies and tools, and guidance on when to use them, all encoded in the DNA. This is how life learns from experience, plans ahead, and avoids dead ends. Life explores new paths at random, but it mostly tries out reasonable variations of known working strategies.</p>



<p>Individual cells aren‚Äôt much like human programmers, but they do have one thing in common: they write code. Mostly, the cell just copies its own DNA (copy / paste is a popular strategy among human programmers, too), but it makes an important decision: what variations to try in the next generation. This happens either through mutations, or by swapping genetic material with other cells. Without a top-down view of the gene sequence, this can only be a random process. The cell has no idea what changes it‚Äôs introducing, or what the consequences might be, but it <em>can</em> try to shape that randomness for the better. Primarily, this means spending a <em>ton</em> of time and energy on error correction, so that only a small number of mutations get through. It also shows up in things like mate selection, genetic recombination, and preparing the environment for the next generation.</p>



<p>I like to think of Darwin‚Äôs story as how life got started. Random mutation and selection are all you need to evolve better forms. As we learn more about cells, though, we see there‚Äôs a lot more going on. Life didn‚Äôt just find better lifestyles, it invented a general purpose platform capable of an infinite variety of lifestyles. As a collective, life uses that platform to explore many lifestyles simultaneously, pruning dead ends and investing more resources into exploring evolutionary paths that seem fruitful. Life started out randomly, but it grew more opinionated over time, and it has evolved many sophisticated ways to direct and shape its own evolution. That will be the topic of my next post.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I‚Äôm very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm trying something a little different. Over the next few months, I will publish a three-part series about evolution from some (hopefully) new perspectives. This represents how I, personally, have come to think about evolution. I‚Äôll go beyond the scientific consensus to talk about some ideas that are uncommon and controversial. I believe I have a compelling story that‚Äôs consistent with established science, but this isn‚Äôt authoritative yet. In fact, I‚Äôm being a little bold and spicy in the hope of attracting criticism and feedback. I hope these ideas will frame my PhD research, so I‚Äôm excited to learn what people find interesting, useful, confusing, or problematic.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm doing this because I believe the way we usually talk about evolution obscures what&#8217;s really going on. In the ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù story, an individual organism lives its life, making choices that either help it thrive and reproduce, or not. If it‚Äôs successful, it will attract mates and have many children who are like them, but a little different, perhaps better. To follow the path of evolution, we then pick a new individual, maybe one of that organism‚Äôs children with a beneficial mutation, and see where life goes from there.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s an oversimplification of Darwin‚Äôs theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. It lacks nuance, but it‚Äôs basically correct and useful. The problem is, it‚Äôs just one way of looking at the situation, shaped by human bias. Each person is a multicellular individual that lives a long time and reproduces sexually, so it‚Äôs natural that we look at evolution from that perspective. But when it comes to life on Earth, we are the exception. The vast majority of life comes in colonies of single-celled organisms, living short lives and reproducing asexually. From that perspective, the process of evolution looks very different.</p>



<p>The next three blog posts will explore that perspective. <strong>Part one</strong> describes the cell as a tiny robot that uses DNA to program its own behavior. This will illustrate what it means to evolve such a program, and what purpose the program serves. <strong>Part two</strong> shifts perspective from a single cell to a population of cells over time. This illustrates how when individual cells work together in large numbers, they program themselves, using an evolutionary algorithm much more powerful than mere random variation and selection. Finally, <strong>part three</strong> discusses the complex ways that life influences the design of its own programming, and effectively ‚Äústeers‚Äù its evolution, in a blind sort of way.</p>



<p>The first post goes out today, and you can read it <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/universal-automata/">here</a>. I‚Äôll release the other two installments in September and November. Each post is written to stand on its own, but together they tell a more powerful story, so I hope you‚Äôll come back for more!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>These days, the Artificial Intelligence community is pretty fixated on Deep Learning, a software tool inspired by the human brain. It‚Äôs popular because it‚Äôs successful. Deep Learning technology has driven incredible advances in natural language processing, image perception / generation, and game playing (not to mention ad targeting, feed ranking, and surveillance). That success was partly driven by luck. It turns out, even a fairly simple DL algorithm, given <em>enormous</em> amounts of data and computational power, can do pretty remarkable things. Other attempts at reproducing intelligent behavior haven‚Äôt been so successful, and are relatively neglected for that reason. That‚Äôs a shame, because I believe there are big opportunities in areas where we aren‚Äôt looking, they&#8217;re just a little more difficult to uncover.</p>



<p>Recently, I‚Äôve taken particular interest in Genetic Algorithms. Put very simply, these are computer programs which use the principle of ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù at their core. They‚Äôve been a popular topic of research since the 1960‚Äôs. Since then, they‚Äôve found moderate success and have become standard kit for solving certain kinds of computational problems. Unfortunately, the fundamental design principles for GAs haven‚Äôt changed much since the 70‚Äôs, despite the fact that our understanding of evolution and our computing hardware have improved <em>dramatically</em> since then. I think today‚Äôs GAs are a shadow of what they could be, and I have ideas for how to unlock that potential.</p>



<p>But first, let‚Äôs establish what a traditional Genetic Algorithm is. Like Deep Learning, GAs are a tool for training a computer to do a task without explicitly telling it how to do the work step by step. There‚Äôs one big difference, though. DL is good at replicating what a human being would do, but to learn that it needs hundreds (or better yet, <em>millions</em>) of examples to study and imitate. So, it‚Äôs mostly good for automating work that people already do routinely. In contrast, GAs don‚Äôt need any example data. They‚Äôre good at solving problems where we <em>don‚Äôt</em> know the best solution or how to find it, just so long as we can recognize a good answer when we see it. The main challenge is framing the problem in such a way that the GA can learn to solve it.</p>



<p>Genetic Algorithms are often used when the space of possible answers is so big it would be impossible to try them all, or even to explore them in a systematic way. Instead, a GA depends on randomness. It starts by just guessing a bunch of solutions. Most of these will be garbage, so they get thrown out right away. The ones that are slightly better than complete garbage become the starting point for the next iteration. The algorithm makes more possible solutions by mixing the best previous solutions together and sprinkling in some extra randomness for variety. By sheer luck, some of those solutions may be better than the previous ones, and the process repeats. This simple method can be surprisingly effective, gradually transforming garbage into gold. But it depends a lot on giving the algorithm the right pieces to start with such that randomly mashing them together might actually work.</p>



<p>Natural selection is a kind of design process. Like human designers do, nature gets inspiration from random sources, tests ideas against harsh reality, and iterates to discover and build highly functional objects. Genetic Algorithms are basically an automated version of that process, so they‚Äôre frequently used as design tools. For instance, modern Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) software for architecture and industrial design often use GAs. A human designer specifies some constraints (how big an object can be, how much weight it must hold, etc.) and fitness goals (minimize weight and material costs, but maximize tensile strength), then the software automatically finds good solutions. Recently, there‚Äôs also been a great deal of interest in using GAs to design effective architectures for Deep Learning systems.</p>



<p>So, that‚Äôs Genetic Algorithms in a nutshell. Why do I feel there&#8217;s unrealized potential here? What do I want to do differently? There are several insights from modern evolutionary theory that I want to apply to GAs. Generally speaking, though, it‚Äôs all about what work is done by the programmer vs. what is left up to evolution. A GA uses a ‚Äúgene sequence‚Äù (usually just a string of digits) to represent each of its attempted solutions. A gene sequence can either be a solution in itself, or a program that generates the solution. Traditionally, what the gene sequence means and how to derive an answer from it is entirely up to the programmer. This is very different from nature, where life evolved the language of genetics and species-specific genomes along with all the organisms built using those tools.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the search process itself. In a traditional Genetic Algorithm, the programmer takes great care to tune the rate of mutation and the process of recombining genes from multiple individuals. They often hand design ‚Äúcustom mutations‚Äù that are more clever than just randomly changing digits in the gene sequence. They use their knowledge and intuition to avoid testing obviously bad gene sequences, to make changes that seem useful, and to preserve good patterns in the gene sequence that might otherwise get clobbered or broken up. This can help enormously, but it&#8217;s a lot of hard work for the programmer. The science of epigenetics shows that nature uses many of the same tricks, but it discovered them through natural selection, without any human guidance.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, life has an element of self-determination. Life designs itself, and optimizes the search process for better designs, using evolution by natural selection as its tool. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to imagine life as a passive product of evolution, like traditional Genetic Algorithms do. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to leave the hardest parts of GA development to a human being. Not only does that make human creativity a limiting factor, it means we aren&#8217;t studying or reproducing the most remarkable thing about natural evolution.</p>



<p>I hope this perspective will be valuable. One of the biggest shortcomings of Genetic Algorithms so far is that they aren&#8217;t nearly as open-ended or creative as life itself. Very rarely do they exhibit the sort of accumulated layers of complexity and sophistication that are the hallmark of natural intelligence. Perhaps that will change, if we can hand over more of the creative work to the GA? Perhaps a new paradigm in GA designs could make them applicable to new kinds of problems, or produce more clever solutions? I&#8217;m working on a prototype that I hope will demonstrate that potential.</p>



<p>The main drawback of my approach is that evolving the design for a Genetic Algorithm takes <em>way</em> more time and computing power than just running a GA designed the old fashioned way. I‚Äôm not too worried about that, though. I‚Äôm using the same parallel processing hardware that has become ubiquitous for Deep Learning applications to make my code efficient and scalable. My hope is that this new approach to GAs will make it possible to improve their performance by just throwing more computational power at the problem, like we already do so successfully with DL. This would also make GAs less cumbersome, by replacing expert design and hand-tuning with automation.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs lots more beyond this that I hope to explore in time. For instance, life evolves whole ecosystems and environments where organisms collaborate and support each other, producing intelligence, robustness, and efficiency far greater than the sum of its parts. By comparison, many Genetic Algorithms work on single individuals that exist in total isolation. Then there‚Äôs the way life evolves layer upon layer of emergent complexity, building communities out of brains, bodies, cells, and proteins. I‚Äôm excited to build multi-layered intelligent systems, and especially to try combining evolved programs and neural networks in a biologically realistic way.</p>



<p>Turns out, there‚Äôs much more to AI than Deep Learning. I‚Äôm pretty excited by the untapped potential of Genetic Algorithms, but that‚Äôs just me. Are there other areas of AI research that interest you? Can you think of more examples of natural intelligence that computers can‚Äôt seem to replicate? I‚Äôd love to hear from you in the comments. This post is also a preview of my research. I hope to share my first prototype by the end of the year. So, stay tuned for more on that.</p>

<p>(featuring illustrations by <a href="https://www.sarinamitchel.com/">Sarina Mitchel</a>)</p>



<p>Imagine your skull is a cockpit. A tiny You sits in front of a view screen and a dashboard, watching the world go by, pulling levers, and pushing buttons. Your body is a robot, precision engineered to protect you, keep you informed, and respond to your every command. It‚Äôs a complex and sophisticated machine, but not intelligent. It does what you tell it to do. Its shape and function were exquisitely designed by God or evolution, and encoded as DNA. That molecule represents the full blueprints for the machine. Now that the design has been perfected, all you have to do is follow the instructions step by step to make the ultimate human tool: your body.</p>



<p>That was probably very easy to imagine. The concept shows up all the time in the media, whether we‚Äôre talking about the literal giant robots from <em>Power Rangers</em>, or the psychological metaphors from movies like <em>Inside Out</em>. This way of conceiving the mind comes naturally to us, in part because that‚Äôs how it feels to be a person, sometimes. Great thinkers like Ren√© Descartes built whole philosophies around this duality of body and mind / soul. It has come to shape how our society works in many profound ways. Unfortunately, science tells a  different story.</p>



<p>Perhaps the first clue that something is off is how human-centric this picture is. Life was around for billions of years before people or brains came onto the scene. Even single-celled organisms perceive the world and quickly respond in ways that show awareness of their situation and how the world works, no brains necessary. When cells band together to make bodies, they often have tiny brains (like insects) or no brains at all (like plants). Humans are among the small minority of species who are entirely dependent on their big brains for survival. Does that mean that we‚Äôre one of the <em>only</em> intelligent species on this planet? Are all the others just empty robots with no one in the pilot seat?</p>



<p>Some might think of DNA as a blueprint that specifies every detail about how to build and operate a living thing, but the reality is much more complicated than that. It‚Äôs better to think of DNA as a family‚Äôs collection of cookbooks, passed on from generation to generation. They‚Äôre full of ingredient lists, recipes, and instructions. The family wouldn‚Äôt know how to cook at all without those books, so they‚Äôre critical to survival. They include all of the family‚Äôs daily staples and seasonal favorites. Even if, in theory, the family could get by on a more exotic diet, they don&#8217;t. Their cookbooks cover the full range of cuisine that they‚Äôre comfortable with, and they don‚Äôt often branch out.</p>



<p>And yet, there‚Äôs plenty of interpretation involved. What should the family cook for dinner tonight? Which recipes and books are more popular, and which go unused? How do they manage the pantry, and what do they do when they don‚Äôt have all the right ingredients? Just because the recipe says one thing, it doesn‚Äôt mean they have to do it that way. In fact, the recipe books are littered with sticky notes which suggest variations. They mark which parts of the recipe to skip, which ingredients to go heavy on, and recommend substitutions. The family can even mix and match parts from multiple recipes, or exchange recipes with friends to try something new.</p>



<p>This is getting a little too anthropomorphic. Cells don‚Äôt think about this sort of thing, because ‚Äúthinking‚Äù isn‚Äôt how they do it. In reality, we&#8217;re talking about molecules, banging around together in chaotic but reliable ways according to the laws of physics. They don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúintentions,‚Äù except maybe the ones implicit in their evolved recipes. But this is how they behave. Each cell is autonomous, responding to the environment with spontaneity. The DNA serves as a reference book, not a program. It isn‚Äôt even used to construct the cell. Remember, cells reproduce by dividing in half. Nature never builds a cell from scratch. Instead, half the family takes half the house, half the pantry, and a full copy of all the cookbooks. They wave goodbye, then carry on living as they always have, just as a separate cell with a separate fate.</p>



<p>DNA is a crucial resource, representing countless generations of acquired knowledge and wisdom. But it is <em>not</em> a blueprint, and that‚Äôs critical to how evolution works. Every cell and every organism lives an open-ended life, doing their best to survive with what they‚Äôre given. When circumstances change, life improvises and diversifies. The same genes may cause different behaviors in new contexts. When one way of living is blocked, old neglected genes may resurface, bringing back old ways of living. In stressful times, cells increase their own mutation rates, taking a risk to generate new variations which might get them out of a bind. This makes life far more flexible than if every aspect of design and behavior was explicitly laid out in the genome.</p>



<p>This becomes even more important for organisms with complex bodies. If DNA really was a blueprint, then building a human body would require precisely positioning and configuring each one of 37 trillion cells. Even if that process was 99.99999% perfect, there‚Äôd still be millions of errors. Luckily, this process is bottom-up, with each cell coordinating with its neighbors to figure out their relationships, what needs doing, and how to work together. That makes errors much more tolerable, since one cell can take over for another, or work around whatever defect is in the way. If the body were built from literal blueprints with no room for improvisation, then even a single cell out of line could potentially throw off everything that comes after. Errors would be much more likely to cascade and accumulate, potentially becoming fatal.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most astounding thing is that each cell in a body has a copy of the <em>same</em> set of cookbooks. They just read them differently, adopting a lifestyle to fit their place in the body. A bit like people in a society, each cell in the body tries to play its own role, and many different roles interact to make something much more than the sum of its parts. From many independent observations, decisions, and actions made locally by each cell, higher order structures and behaviors emerge. Cells make up organs and bodies. They manage bodily resources, capture and aggregate information about the world, and respond in coordinated ways. They perform extraordinary feats, like moving 37 trillion cells through space, gracefully and without damage.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a swarm of nanobots, clinging together to form a giant mecha. This mecha has evolved to do something useful, but its shape and function are only loosely defined. Each nanobot is a mindless automaton, operating independently within some constraints that are just specific enough for it to serve some purpose within the greater whole. These nanobots cluster to form dynamic structures, nested machines made of machines, in constant motion, building up to massive size and complexity. In order to manage this unwieldy bulk, the nanobots weave together into a neuromorphic computer. This specialized sub-processor simulates the world in real time, predicts what comes next, and carefully coordinates the timing of activity across this whole vast assemblage.</p>



<p>Part of that computer is responsible for imagining what it‚Äôs like to <em>be</em> the giant mecha. Its whole existence is within a simulated environment, extrapolated from the trillions of tiny motes of sensory data provided by the swarm. It watches the behaviors and emotions produced by the swarm, and uses them to tell stories about the values, needs, and intentions that guide the mecha&#8217;s behavior. It makes educated guesses about what the mecha will do next, which the swarm uses as hints to guide their behavior. As the only part of the mecha that is self-aware, and having no direct perception of the nanobots themselves, this simulation imagines itself to be in charge, and assumes the whole arrangement is for its benefit.</p>



<p>I know this is an uncomfortable image for many people. It‚Äôs not warm and fuzzy. It probably feels strange, maybe even disgusting. It‚Äôs not how we like to think of ourselves. However, ‚Äústrange‚Äù and ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù are also excellent words to describe living bodies, in all their infinite variety. Human beings are machines made of meat and bone. They are also unique souls, with meaningful lives, profound experiences, and extraordinary talents. The challenge is to see this not as a contradiction, but as two sides of the same coin. We can be the pilot in the cockpit, <em>and</em> the nanobot swarm.</p>



<p>What do you think? Is this a useful way of thinking about mind and body? Have you ever noticed moments when your body dominates your mind and the &#8220;pilot in the cockpit&#8221; illusion seems to break down? Or do you think I&#8217;m under-selling the power and importance of the brain? Is it right to say that &#8220;nobody&#8217;s home&#8221; in life without a brain, or is it more complicated than that? Any questions about this &#8220;cookbook&#8221; metaphor and what&#8217;s <em>really</em> going on in the cell? I&#8217;d love to hear from you. Please, join the conversation in the comments section.</p>
