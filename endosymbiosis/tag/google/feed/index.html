										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello there, reader. I hope you’ve been enjoying the blog. It’s been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That’s going great, but it’s keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don’t think I can keep up that pace. I’ve got a few finished posts queued up, but I’ve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every <em>three</em> months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We’ll see!</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I’d share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I’m about two thirds of the way through my first semester.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It’s electrifying. I don’t know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I’m often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they’re pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I’m reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I’m integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I’m learning isn’t radically new or different, but I’m fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on research yet, but I&#8217;m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others’, and vice versa. It’s helping see new angles and new possibilities. I’m talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I’d like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I&#8217;m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It’s forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others’ ideas.</p>



<p>This is exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve been on my own since leaving Google, and the experience is just underscoring something I know to be true: human minds aren’t meant to work alone. We&#8217;re social creatures, and most of us just cannot reach our full capacity in isolation. At UVM, my mind is constantly stimulated, and I’m always challenged to stretch myself, try new ideas, and make new contributions. I feel I can go much further here, and accomplish great things. Of course, the flip side is that it’s <em>exhausting</em>, especially while I’m still new and figuring out how things work here. The pace of activity is very fast, and there’s much more to read, do, and learn than I could possibly fit into a day.</p>



<p>In some sense, that’s already very familiar. My experience at Google (especially near the end, when I was leading teams) was also a fast paced, continuous, information overload. The key skills for dealing with that are prioritization and time management. I just have to pick what to spend my time on, and let everything else pass me by with minimal interference. Thankfully, I’ve gotten really good at that.</p>



<p>Still, I’m definitely feeling challenged right now, and so busy I barely have time to breathe. There are a few reasons for that. One is just that the pace of life was so much gentler over the past couple of years as I made this transition. I was working very hard, but my work was self-paced and I had very little external pressure. I took my time. Nobody was depending on me, or judging my performance. So, I’m having the jarring experience of suddenly stepping onto a moving treadmill. Only now, after a few months of settling in, have I found a good rhythm where I can keep up with all my work, have a life, and also pursue my own research goals.</p>



<p>This is also hard because I’m running on a very different sort of treadmill than what I experienced at Google. In a sense, it’s easier. I have a ton of work to do, but it’s mostly low-stakes reading, writing, and coding at a steady pace. As a manager at Google, my work was mostly decisions, strategy, and people issues. I spent a lot of time moving from crisis to crisis. I had to act quickly and decisively with limited information. My decisions would have a big, often irreversible impact on people’s lives (sometimes individuals I knew and cared about, and sometimes millions of strangers). I was accountable for those human consequences. That’s stressful! By comparison, grad school work is fun and low pressure.</p>



<p>In another sense, Google was actually much easier than academia, because it was highly structured. There, everyone had a well defined job role with explicit expectations. We had official priorities and ways of doing things that everyone adhered to. Everyone was organized into teams, which served complementary purposes and fit into a coherent whole. Leaders held meetings with regular cadences every week, month, quarter, etc., checking in on progress and aligning people on their mission, values, goals, and priorities. We never lived up to the ideal, but Google felt a bit like a clockwork mechanism. We all had a function, individually and collectively, and we worked together in lock-step to make it happen.</p>



<p>Academia and science are <em>far</em> less structured. Every PhD, every lab, every department, and every school do things differently. There are very few hard constraints, and anything that fits within them is valid. In grad school, lectures and assignments feel a bit more like “recommended work,” and you&#8217;re expected to invest only as much into them as makes sense for your needs. This is freeing, but also in some sense very frustrating. There are no best practices. Nobody can tell me what to do, or how to succeed. There’s very little indication of how I’m doing, or what progress I’m making. Everyone’s working more or less independently, on only sorta related projects, within a vaguely defined scope, based on their own judgment. There’s little sharing, few standards, and plenty of waste.</p>



<p>That said, science <em>should</em> be less structured than engineering. It <em>must</em> be. The university is designed this way to encourage diverse ways of thinking and of approaching problems. The challenge of science is that we don’t know what we don’t know. We don’t know what to look for, where to look, or how we&#8217;ll find it. Very often important truths are hidden behind common ideas and practices that everyone “knows” to be right, even though they are blatantly wrong! It’s important that students can follow in the footsteps of great thinkers and flesh out their works, but also that they can go in completely new directions and find what was overlooked. The chaos and freedom can be challenging, but it’s a necessary ingredient for innovation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Well, that’s what’s going on with me. I hope my thoughts on grad student life are interesting. I will start experimenting with the format of this blog and see where it goes. If you have any thoughts or suggestions about that, please let me know! If you’d like to stay more up to date on what I’m doing and thinking, I’m most active on Mastodon. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s basically a smaller, nerdier version of Twitter that isn&#8217;t owned by an alt-right friendly oligarch, and with much healthier communication norms and moderation practices. I post there pretty often, and I respond to most comments / DMs. You can find my profile <a href="http://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">here</a>.</p>

<p>(I took this posts&#8217;s photo of a banana slug crawling through leaf litter. It&#8217;s shape and color resembles some of the leaves, which makes it hard to spot if you don&#8217;t know what to look for)</p>



<p>People say all sorts of things about the world, but how can you tell what’s right? If you’re not sure, you probably want to see for yourself. Those other people might be confused, mistaken, suffering from wishful thinking, or actively trying to mislead you, but <em>you</em> see reality for what it is. Right? At the least, you won’t have the <em>same</em> misperceptions as them, so another look is useful. But how much can you trust your own senses? How does perception even work, and how come we’re so often misled?</p>



<p>Like most people, I “just see” everything around me. Sometimes, I become aware of my perspective. I move around to get a clear view. I notice where I’m glancing, and I know I can’t see what’s behind my head. Yet, most of the time I <em>don’t</em> think about those things at all. The visual world just seems to surround me seamlessly, with rich, consistent detail in all directions. Objects are plain to see, trivial to discern from most angles and distances. It all seems so obvious, like a simple “window on reality,” yet nothing could be farther from the truth.</p>



<p>Human eyes have tunnel vision. I only see a tiny spot in clear focus at a time. My eyes constantly dart around, collecting many snapshots of the world as I move through it. My brain gets a continuous stream of these disconnected snatches of imagery that it somehow must turn into an integrated whole. It tracks my position and perspective as I move through the world, to piece the images together and infer a 3D model of my surroundings. This takes a great deal of real time data processing, and more than a little creativity.</p>



<p>One thing humans <em>don’t</em> do is scan a scene from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, like a TV camera, capturing equally high fidelity data of a whole scene. My eyes are drawn to “interesting” features of the visual field, gathering much more detail about those, and leaving large gaps over the “boring” parts of the image where I never bothered to look closely. To get a sense of this yourself, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo&amp;ab_channel=DanielSimons">selective attention test</a> on YouTube. It’s pretty shocking how well the brain filters relevant details from irrelevant ones, and shows you only what it thinks is useful. Of course, what’s “interesting” or “useful” is a judgment call, and I’m biased by my context, culture, and evolution. That means I’m blind to important things that I don’t expect, recognize, or know about.</p>



<p>Yet, I don’t notice any gaps in my perception. My brain creates the illusion of a clear and complete view of reality, using a technique called hierarchical segmentation. The image from my eyes is projected into my brain, then layer after layer of neurons <em>interpret</em> that image. The first layer detects patterns and discontinuities in the raw image data: edges. The second layer detects patterns in those edges: shapes. Layers above detect patterns of patterns of patterns, finding textures, objects, faces, bodies, groups, situations, and more. I <em>don’t</em> see pixels, colors, and shapes. I <em>directly perceive</em> the objects and agents in a scene, their properties, activities, and relationships. I experience that as if it were “really there,” even though it’s just a model in my mind, distantly derived from sense data.</p>



<p>The first pass of vision notices low-level features present in the image (edges, corners, curves), but doesn’t know what they mean. Later passes piece those features together to represent larger features (in a desk drawer, that arrangement of curves <em>must</em> be a fidget spinner). Most likely, the lower-level processing didn’t see <em>all</em> the relevant details clearly, but that’s okay. The fidget spinner neurons see enough to recognize what’s there. They tell the edge-detecting neurons what they <em>should have seen</em>, filling in the missing details. This is how I can clearly perceive a whole fidget spinner, even though it’s in shadow and half covered. My brain uses past knowledge of objects, where they appear, what they look like, and how they behave to imagine what was obscured.</p>



<p>This works extremely well, and it’s <em>necessary</em>, since low-level sensory data is noisy and ambiguous. It often helps to have some idea what I’m looking at to make sense of what I’m seeing. Yet, sometimes my brain’s predictions are wrong. That’s <em>not</em> actually a fidget spinner in the drawer, it’s a pile of coins. How could I tell? Well, the fidget spinner neurons projected their predictions down, but looking a little more closely, some of those guesses were clearly wrong. There were some edges that weren’t accounted for, some angles that didn’t fit. The lower level neurons noticed the gap between expectation and reality, so they had to push back and negotiate with the higher level neurons, eventually arriving at an interpretation that was the best compromise across multiple levels of analysis.</p>



<p>What I perceive is a blending of what my senses took in and what “makes sense” for me to see based on past experience. At first glance, I only notice the most eye-catching details and my mind fills in the rest. If I take my time to really look over a scene, exploring every corner and paying attention to details, then my past experience has less influence and I perceive reality more like it truly is. I’m giving my lower-level perceptions the best chance to find evidence that I wasn’t expecting to see, which might revise my first impression. The problem is, I can’t afford to do this all the time, and often don’t think to. When should I bother to put in the extra effort? When should I distrust my own perception of reality enough to double check?</p>



<p>My brain automatically groups every object I see into <em>categories</em>, collections of objects with similar properties. Each category has a mental <em>stereotype</em>, an image that sort of averages all my experiences. This is how I know the “normal” shape of a fidget spinner, even though no two are the same. It’s where my mind draws from when it fills the gaps in my perception. As I gain experience, I learn more useful ways to group things into categories that better predict their similarities and differences. I build more accurate, nuanced, and fine-grain stereotypes, which makes my perceptions clearer. That said, it’s easy to hold onto bad stereotypes. They warp my perception, overwriting key details of a visual scene that might prove me wrong, rendering them <em>literally invisible</em> to me until someone points them out.</p>



<p>Stereotypes play a central role in perception, and all the fancy understanding, thinking, and being human that layers on top of that. Stereotypes are great tools. They’re bite-sized models of reality that let us generalize past experience and predict the future. But they aren’t real. In fact, many of my stereotypes aren’t based on my experience at all. I learned them from other people! Some may be wrong, hurtful, and dangerous, but I wouldn&#8217;t know without personal experience. So far we’ve just been talking about objects, but it gets serious when we move onto people.</p>



<p>I saw this when I worked at Google. They would spoil engineers, with easy access to everything from staplers to lunch to massages. That meant lots of staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and in good working order. These service workers—these <em>people</em>—were generally ignored, treated as part of the environment rather than part of the team. That’s problematic in itself, but also engineers with darker skin tones often reported being mistaken for the service staff. Despite wearing a nerdy T-shirt and an engineering badge, they got categorized as “the help” based on skin alone. They were ignored, or worse, asked to clean up spills. This was demoralizing, even though there was no ill-intent. They just weren’t seen, by folks who were misled by stereotypes and didn’t even notice.</p>



<p>Knowing all this makes me distrust my own senses, but I think that’s a good thing. They’re <em>mostly</em> reliable, but they can fail in specific ways, and it’s important to remember that. It’s also useful to know <em>when</em> to trust my stereotypes. That mostly comes down to knowing where I have deep personal experience and have paid close attention. Where I don’t, my stereotype might be a shallow hand-me-down, even though it feels just as &#8220;real&#8221; in my mind. What about you? Have you noticed folks seeing what they want to see, or hearing what they want to hear? How does this generalize to other kinds of perceptions? How do you try to see reality for what it truly is? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We tend to think of human intelligence as the power of a single brain, but human beings aren’t meant to work in isolation. Our intelligence is only fully realized in a group setting, where we can riff off each other, collaborate, and compete. But humans behave very differently in groups, and coordinating group behavior is hard. I didn’t fully appreciate that until I became a leader at Google. Leaders can’t just tell people what they want to make it happen. Their work is much more subtle: they shape incentive landscapes.</p>



<p>Ultimately, each person decides for themselves what to do at any moment. This is one of our superpowers as a species. We understand our environment, our place within it, and the choices available to us. We make decisions and plans that benefit us and our communities. This is not a particularly rational process. It’s heavily influenced by our instincts and emotions, through neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin. Ultimately, it all comes down to what makes us feel good, whether that’s a literal reward like a doughnut or a paycheck, or more subtle pleasures like helping others or earning respect.</p>



<p>The theory of evolution often talks about “fitness landscapes.” Each organism is more or less “fit”, or likely to survive, thrive, and produce offspring in its environment. Across generations, a species explores different body shapes and behaviors, searching this fitness landscape for better lifestyles. Incentive landscapes are more or less the same thing, just on a different time scale. Evolution has equipped us with the ability to perceive and predict risks and rewards. It has hard-wired us to make real time decisions that, on average, should improve our reproductive fitness.</p>



<p>As a leader, this mostly means I have limited control over my team’s behavior. Yet, their decisions aren’t entirely free. Our team culture makes some paths much more likely than others. The best metaphor for this comes from sailing. Culture creates headwinds and tailwinds, which determine which paths are harder or easier. Tailwinds mean the wind is at my back, pushing me forward. Paths with a tailwind are more obvious, encouraged, and supported. Headwinds are the exact opposite. Those paths are obscured, high-friction, and full of obstacles. I can still go down a path with headwinds, and may even find success there, it just requires more effort and determination.</p>



<p>Leaders can’t decide what each person will do. Instead, they use incentives to influence all those independent choices, making the desired outcomes more likely <em>on average</em>. The most direct way to do this is with reward and punishment. When they&#8217;re transparent and consistent, they can guide group behavior quite effectively. Sometimes. A big challenge is that everyone perceives incentives differently. Some folks are highly motivated by a good speech, while others will simply roll their eyes. Extroverts may thrive on public recognition and fame, while introverts may dread the spotlight. Sometimes, money is the best motivator, and sometimes it feels demeaning. Punishment is just as problematic. How well a fine works depends on wealth. Some people take perverse pride in breaking the rules, and foster a reputation as a rebel. Sometimes punishment is just an incentive not to get caught.</p>



<p>For this reason, incentive landscapes are quite complex. Making them robust means combining many different factors that reinforce each other, so all together they will have similar effects across a diverse group. Incentives are hard to manage, since they&#8217;re not in the leader&#8217;s control–every person in a group influences the others by the behaviors they normalize, the feedback they give, and their social interactions. Just being aware of the incentive landscape and how each team member perceives and experiences it differently can be a tremendous challenge for a leader. It&#8217;s also critically important. When someone’s goals and motivations don’t align with group incentives, they leave.</p>



<p>One example of how different people experience incentives differently is racial equity. At Google, there is no rule saying black people can&#8217;t be hired, promoted, or given positions of authority. Just the opposite, actually. Leaders work hard to encourage those things. But black names on resumes sound less professional. Black students are less likely to attend prestigious schools, or master all the jargon folks look for in interviews. No one will say “I don’t trust a black person to do this right,” but they will scrutinize the work more closely, hold it to a higher standard, or reassign it to someone with more experience. Despite leaders’ best intentions, black people face greater friction on every path. A supportive leader needs to recognize that, and attempt to compensate without playing favorites.</p>



<p>A leader does a lot of talking. We talk about our team&#8217;s purpose, our goals, and why they matter. We talk about what success looks like. We talk about our values, and how to be a good citizen. We do this in big meetings, so everyone can hear. We depend on folks to repeat the message, model good behavior, and pressure their peers. This can be a powerful tool, but only if incentives truly align with the talk. My infrastructure team at Google talked about the importance of code health for years, but it was neglected until we actually held people accountable and rewarded grungy clean-up work. Tech companies love to talk about their respect and appreciation for women. They make commercials, throw parties, and host lavish recruiting events. But if women must work much harder to achieve the same salary and career progression as their male peers, then the talk is meaningless.</p>



<p>The incentive landscape is highly volatile, as world events and many people continually shape it. I led a project to rebuild the user interface infrastructure for Google Search. I crafted a story and designed incentives to guide us. Then, an adjacent team announced a major redesign of the Search page. It was like our plan to repave the downtown streets and redesign signal patterns to streamline traffic was suddenly preempted by a massive parade with the governor giving the keynote speech. How could we do our job without getting in the way? Anything perceived as a risk to the redesign suddenly had massive headwinds.</p>



<p>My job was to reshape the incentive landscape so my team had a smooth and fruitful path forward. Despite being the leader, my decisions were shaped by incentives beyond my control just as much as anyone else. I was powerless to stop the redesign, so instead we joined in. We prioritized cleaning up the parts <em>they</em> wanted done. We adapted to their schedule, to avoid stepping on their toes. We got them to do their work in a way that also advanced our goals, but we had to be very careful not to slow them down. We made tools for them, so the “right way” to do their job was also the easy way. This let us ride their tailwinds. We had to compromise on our goals, but it allowed us to move forward, perhaps better than if there had been no redesign at all.</p>



<p>A group’s leader has very limited control, but there’s an important flip side to that: individuals have more power than they realize. The greatest misconception about leadership is that it’s something granted by those in authority. More often, leadership is recognized and co-opted by authority. Anyone who influences their peers <em>is</em> a leader. Other leaders will see those influencers as either opportunities or threats, and react accordingly. Whether they chose to support or resist this budding leader often comes down to which path seems easier. In other words, they tend to follow the incentive landscape.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this fit with your experience? Do you know any great leaders who excel at getting everyone on the same page? Do you have examples of perverse incentives undermining the best of intentions? Any thoughts about how pressure from peers and leaders affect your decisions, or how they interact with your emotions and instincts? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction</h2>



<p>In the tech industry, leading a team is sometimes referred to as “programming with people.” As a novice engineer, I saw that as a cute metaphor that makes managers sound more technical than they actually are. After years of management, though, I’ve come to see it as quite literally true. In both cases, you’re trying to set up a complex system that, when left to run, will perform useful work and solve problems. The only difference is in how you define and maintain those systems. It’s a dramatic difference, though, which is why the parallels are hard to see at first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Human Machines</h2>



<p>What makes human beings unique among animals is our capacity to collaborate. Language lets us serialize ideas and pass them from mind to mind, quickly, easily, and in high fidelity. Sharing ideas lets us build systems bigger than a single person, whether that be a hunting party, a soccer team, or a company. We agree on goals, specialize in different tasks, and coordinate our strategy to form intelligent machines built out of humans. Although everything the group does is the product of individual people, the group itself has its own independent identity and can have behaviors that are totally different from what the individuals do.</p>



<p>So how do you make one of these human machines? The remarkable thing is they form spontaneously, all the time. Human beings instinctively want to socialize, build relationships, and help one another accomplish things. It’s an innate drive, built by evolution and mediated by emotions like pride, belonging, and admiration. In other words, all collaborative endeavors rely on healthy human emotions and relationships. Before we get carried away with the machine metaphor, we must remember that human needs must come first. That includes basics like compensation and healthcare, of course, but also more touchy-feely things like work / life balance, sense of purpose, a supportive community, autonomy, and growth. Providing these things is the humane thing to do, but it&#8217;s also good business. Happier, healthier, more fulfilled employees who trust and respect each other are much more productive and successful.</p>



<p>But we don’t just let teams form organically and do whatever they please. Leaders rally people around specific goals, then coordinate and direct their work. This is much harder than it sounds. One of the first things I discovered as a leader was how little control I had over my team. I could ask them to write some code for me, but it might come out all wrong if the solution I asked for was counter-intuitive to them. I could ramble on about the importance of code health, and everyone would nod in enthusiastic agreement, but that alone rarely changed anyone&#8217;s behavior. I couldn’t <em>make</em> people get along, hit a deadline, tell me what they “really think,” or hold off on sending that flippant email. Ultimately, what my team did was the product of all the people in it. Human beings simply aren’t robots who do what they’re told. Each person sees the world differently, has their own agenda, and makes decisions based on what makes sense to them. Leadership is getting people to choose to do what’s best for the team, <em>on their own terms</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Culture</h2>



<p>While computers are configured with software, humans are configured with <em>memes</em>: ideas and ways of being that we share with each other, internalize, and repeat. Each community has its own unique set of memes (its <em>culture</em>) which shapes its behavior. Culture includes the things that define a group, like the stories about who that group is and what they do, the activities they do together, and the relationships and patterns of communication with other groups. It also includes “guard rails” in the form of expectations, goals, incentives, and peer pressure that encourage good behavior and group alignment. A leader has outsize influence on a group’s culture, but in reality culture is emergent, continually being reinvented by every member of the community as they speak and act. A leader’s job is to cultivate a healthy culture, like a garden. They make an environment with rich soil and lots of light. They water the flowers, and pluck the weeds.</p>



<p>This means embracing the diverse perspectives of the team, supporting grassroots ideas, and giving folks a chance to prove themselves. At Google, my director once told me the whole department was going to focus on developer experience (DevEx) next quarter, and I should figure out what that meant for my team. A bunch of ideas immediately sprung to mind, but I decided to start with a team discussion. I explained why we were doing this, facilitated some talk about what good DevEx means, then opened the table for ideas. I didn’t start with my ideas. As a manager, my voice would overwhelm others, and my intuition was less valuable than the actual developers on my team. When someone suggested one of my ideas, it became theirs. I gave them my full support and feedback, but let them run with it in their own way. Then someone else had an idea that was surprising and unfamiliar. I wasn’t sure it would work or that the person was up to the challenge, but they were eager and confident, and a few others seemed to think the idea had potential. So, rather than sticking with the safe options, we talked about the costs and the benefits of this idea, how it might go wrong, how to prevent that, and how we could quickly test whether it was working. It turned out to be a smash hit.</p>



<p>Cultivating a healthy culture also means encouraging good habits, while discouraging harmful ones. As my team increased our focus on DevEx, we had to establish new patterns of communication. We had to deal with frustrated customers, disarm their anger, and listen deeply to their problems and feedback. We had to set healthy boundaries, making it very clear what we considered to be &#8220;not our problem,&#8221; low priority, or working as intended. We had to provide hands-on help to build trust and a reputation of competence. As a leader, my challenge was to keep up with my team&#8217;s work so I could give regular feedback, highlight good examples to share with the whole team, explain why some behavior was good or bad, and reward people in ways they found personally meaningful. I also had to be very consistent about modeling good behavior myself, but that could only go so far. I couldn’t possibly control, participate in, or even keep track of every request, conversation, or conflict. Instead, I focused on giving my team the tools, incentives, and trust to muddle through on their own. They did great.</p>



<p>Since a team&#8217;s behavior is mostly determined by its culture, one interesting consequence is that friction between teams is almost always a matter of culture shock. Each team has their own understanding of the work, their own ways of doing things, their own vocabulary, and their own sense of right and wrong. Most people aren’t consciously aware of their culture. It’s simply “how things are done.” This means it’s often surprising and upsetting to see someone do things differently. It feels like they are <em>wrong</em>, and getting in the way of your team and what&#8217;s good for the company. Misunderstandings are common. Two cultures might share a word in common, for instance, but the meaning or sentiment of that word might be totally different, in a way that neither side notices.</p>



<p>At one point, my team was building tools for our partners, who would use those tools to build user-facing products. Though we were friends working on the same code, it sometimes felt like our teams were from different planets. They used code names for major projects they were involved in, but our team didn&#8217;t know or care about. The problematic legacy code that my team was trying to eliminate and replace was their bread and butter. They had to use it <em>extensively</em> to meet their product goals, constantly adding more to the mess and getting upset when our improvements changed things out from under them and slowed down their work. We needed each other to do our jobs, but some level of conflict was inevitable.</p>



<p>As a leader in this space, a big part of my job was to act as a cultural interpreter. I lived in <em>both</em> worlds, to the extent I could. I had to align both teams on language and best practice. We had to agree on what vague concepts like &#8220;visual consistency&#8221; meant for our product, and ideally find a standard way to measure them. We had to debate priorities, which often meant figuring out how their goals might suffer if our goals weren&#8217;t met, even when they seemed totally unrelated. When conflict arose, I sat down with both sides, listening carefully, sussing out the root cause of our misunderstanding, and finding a new way to frame the discussion so we didn’t feel opposed to one another. In most cases, both sides were right and ultimately wanted the same things. The challenge was in helping everyone appreciate the other perspectives, and in turning an argument about &#8220;my way&#8221; vs &#8220;your way&#8221; into a discussion about what sort of compromise might strike a healthy balance and mitigate all our concerns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Efficiency</h2>



<p>Getting things done with diverse, independent, self-interested people can feel like herding cats. It’s the worst thing about programming with people, but it’s also the best thing. The real strength of human beings is their autonomy and creativity. Unlike computers, people will figure out how to solve a problem for themselves. They might even notice that they’re working on the <em>wrong</em> problem and choose to solve a different one instead. That’s an incredible super power, and the job of a good leader is to coax this out and make the most of it. This requires mastering some “programming techniques” that are wildly different from what works on computers.</p>



<p>One important technique is thinking in negative space. That is, in a creative project, a leader should avoid saying what <em>to do</em>, but instead focus on describing what <em>success looks like</em>. This gives each person a license, a <em>responsibility</em> even, to find their own way to a solution. This is why a leader will typically kick-off a new software team by writing a mission statement, or describing a vision for the future. Only <em>then</em> do they make a roadmap of work to do, usually with the help of the whole team. A healthy team has a clearly defined scope. Everyone knows what the team does and what they <em>don’t</em> do. The scope should be loose enough to leave room to explore, find new opportunities, and grow over time in whatever direction feels right. That’s not possible for a team defined in positive space—that is, purely based on the tasks they do.</p>



<p>On an individual level, the best way to think in negative space is to use <em>problem statements</em>. When I discover a new problem for my team to solve, I can’t help but imagine the good and bad ways to solve it. As an experienced engineer, my intuition is valuable, so it may be surprising that I make an effort to <em>suppress</em> those ideas at first. When I delegate some task, I want that person to take full ownership for the work. I want them to find a solution that <em>they</em> find intuitive, know inside and out, take pride in, resolve on their own, and take full credit for. I want to give them the chance to find a better solution than I can imagine, and permission to change strategy if they discover the first idea isn’t working. I want to let them make mistakes (safe, small ones), and learn from them. My intuition still matters, of course. It just shows up in the form of constraints and feedback. I highlight the key design factors and priorities, the challenges I anticipate, the properties that any good solution must have, how the work will be judged, and how this piece will fit into the bigger picture. As long as those things are satisfied, then it really doesn’t matter what design they choose.</p>



<p>Another challenge in working with human beings is their limited cognitive capacity. People are smart, but things like attention, will power, patience, and decision making are limited resources that can quickly be exhausted. When that happens, people make mistakes, cut corners, procrastinate, and get into conflicts. This isn’t a personal failing, it’s simply human nature. As a leader, I try to prevent that and make sure that limited, precious human brain power isn’t wasted.</p>



<p>The primary tools for this are <em>process</em> and <em>policy</em>. That is, figuring out how to do things up front, and standardizing that across the team. This includes things like checklists, frequently asked questions, form letters, bug report templates, and duty rosters. Revisiting the programming metaphor, this is actually pretty similar to how an engineer might optimize a program by moving code out of a loop, or from client to server. It’s about decoupling the work of deciding what to do and how to do it (an open ended and relatively difficult problem) from the work of actually doing the task (which is often just rote execution). The idea is to do the hard work when the team’s got the time and energy for it, not under pressure in the moment it’s needed. The planning gets done <em>once</em>, then the plan gets reused time and time again.</p>



<p>Process and policy are ways to externalize cognitive work and automate part of a team’s execution. They reduce the cognitive load and personal responsibility for each team member, but also reduce their autonomy and flexibility. That’s the polar opposite of thinking in negative space, like I advocated above. The reality is, a good leader’s job is learning how to balance these two ways of thinking, and applying them in the right circumstances. The goal is to encourage autonomy, creativity, and active thinking where it matters, and conserve those resources by using rote execution when that&#8217;s good enough. Knowing the difference is more of an art than a science.</p>



<p>There’s an interesting parallel here with biology. Life strikes a balance between cognitive power and instinct. Animals with big brains can think for themselves in the moment, taking context into account, finding new solutions, and jumping on opportunities as they present themselves. But in a life or death situation, it’s critical to do the right thing at the right moment. Sometimes thinking just wastes precious time, and opens up the possibility of doing the <em>wrong</em> thing. In those situations, instinct takes over, limiting the animal’s freedom, but preventing them from getting bogged down with a puzzle at the worst moment. Over time, intentional behaviors that work reliably can become instincts (this is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_effect">Baldwin Effect</a>). On the flip side, any instincts that no longer serve and unnecessarily limit an organism&#8217;s reproductive potential tend to be eliminated by natural selection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Well, I could go on, but that seems like enough for one post. What do you think? Does this resonate with your own experience? If you work in another profession, does this sound right or are things very different for you? Do you have more ideas or advice to share? If so, then please leave a comment below. As always, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
