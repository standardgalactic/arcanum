<p>(This post&#8217;s image is a photo I took of my yoga gear. Specialized tools like my mat, blocks, and strap work together to make my practice possible. They extend my body, and help arrange it in the ways my mind imagines)</p>



<p>I was pretty sedentary as a kid, and didn’t get serious about physical fitness until I was an adult. One nice thing about that is I got to watch myself learn, knowing all I do now about the brain. By practicing yoga and working with physical therapists, I’ve learned a lot about myself, but also how mind and body work together. Mastering a new physical skill actually recruits at least <em>three</em> separate learning processes working together. Understanding this changed my expectations, helped me gain more control over my body, and made exercise much more enjoyable.</p>



<p>When I first started yoga, I was startled by how little I knew about my body. My teachers were asking me to observe and discern sensations I’d never noticed before. They asked me to get into certain poses, using certain muscle groups, and I didn’t know how! I didn’t have the names for these things. Worse, I could <em>see</em> what I was supposed to do, but I didn’t know how to make my body do that, or even if I could. It was frustrating.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s weird to think how ignorant we are of our bodies, given that we live in them our whole lives. For me, a prime example comes from physical therapy. When recovering from an injury, I relearned how to walk up stairs. I’ve climbed stairs thoughtlessly my whole life, and I never considered there were different ways to do it. But the leg is controlled by opposing muscle groups. I used to climb stairs by <em>lifting</em> each leg, using just the muscles on the front side. I learned to also use the muscles on the <em>back</em> side, to push up and straighten the leg. Either set of muscles can do the job alone. Now, I consciously try to balance the effort from both sides, but this never would have occurred to me without knowing a little anatomy.</p>



<p>That knowledge was game changing for me, but unfortunately knowing how the body works isn’t good enough. I can memorize anatomical diagrams, muscle names, and facts about body mechanics, but the only interface between the brain and body are the spinal nerves. How’s the brain supposed to know what nerve impulses correspond to which movements? There’s actually a region of the brain dedicated to this problem, <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/12/07/learning-to-move/">the cerebellum</a>, but it’s not consciously accessible. This is why yoga instructors use <em>cues</em>: they teach little mental tricks for recruiting muscles, and associate them with relevant postures.</p>



<p>Try this. Bend your elbows ninety degrees to extend your forearms out from your body, palms up. Imagine someone’s handing you a heavy platter. You might notice the trapezius and rhomboid muscles engage between your shoulders. These muscles largely serve a supportive role. For many people, they aren’t <em>needed</em> much in daily life, but using them can improve posture and reduce strain on other muscles. The problem is, they’re easy to ignore and hard to describe. But I can turn them on with the cue, and then I can learn what it <em>feels like</em> to use those muscles. Once I can tell whether they’re working, I can often activate them at will. Or, I can just use the cue, as needed.</p>



<p>Of course, conscious knowledge of form and cues are just step one. Muscle control is mostly <em>un</em>conscious, and for good reason. Remembering all the cues, monitoring my body, and continuously correcting my posture is <em>work</em>. It takes my full attention, leaving no room for anything else. Luckily, that’s just a phase. With enough practice, my cerebellum learns the patterns and can take over. I can hand off that work to my unconscious motion control sub-processor, freeing my conscious mind to think about something else.</p>



<p>This is why physical therapy can be so effective. After an injury, some muscles and joints may not perform like they used to. Some links between mind and body might even be severed or scrambled. Recovery means learning new ways to do old activities. At first, this is a nightmare. Without the support of the cerebellum, even just walking is an intensive conscious effort. Physical therapy can be a painful, tedious, and drawn-out process, but for many patients it makes a world of difference. It teaches the cerebellum new motion programs. Potentially, walking can become fully automatic again. The conscious mind can be used to retrain the unconscious mind in profound and lasting ways.</p>



<p>Yet knowing how to move isn’t enough if the body can’t follow through. The hardest part about learning a new physical activity is that the body usually isn’t ready for it. When I first started yoga, my muscles were weak, rigid, and lazy. They quickly became tired and sore, which just made me want to use them less. They struggled to move my body weight, and were so tight that my range of motion was limited. Some postures were hard, uncomfortable, or impossible. I couldn’t keep up, and when I pushed myself harder, I only injured myself.</p>



<p>That taught me a lesson about patience and acceptance. My body wasn’t ready, so I couldn’t do those poses, but I could work towards them. I learned to listen to my muscles complain, and to distinguish between different sensations. Some indicate hard limits I should not push past, but most are just signs of stress, and those can be <em>good</em>. When muscles, bones, and tendons get stressed, they respond by becoming bigger, stronger, and tougher in a process called anti-fragility. The discomfort I feel is just that physical learning process in action. By embracing the discomfort, I could slowly reshape my body.</p>



<p>Anti-fragility doesn’t involve the brain, conscious or unconscious. It’s a kind of learning that happens in the body tissues themselves. My muscles “know” whether they are getting the job done. They can tell if they are actually contracting and relaxing when they get the signal, whether that was easy or hard, and whether they sustained any damage in the attempt. They recognize how often they are put to use, and whether they are usually exhausted or ready for action.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, muscles conserve energy by doing as little as possible. But when I regularly demand more of them, they adapt. They become bigger, stronger, and more responsive. They consume more energy at rest so they’re always ready for action when I need them. They become less lazy, working harder by default, which makes them stronger still. This requires more protein to build the muscles, and more calories to power them. So my metabolism adapts, too. I eat more and my body burns more calories continuously, rather than storing them as fat.</p>



<p>What’s so fascinating is how all three ways of learning work together. With conscious thought, I choose to change my behavior. I master new facts and cues, so I know what I’m doing at an intellectual level, and can execute new skills (poorly, at first). With practice, not only do I refine those skills, but I engage an unconscious learning process that makes them fully automatic. I can focus my mind on the task I want to accomplish, and trust my body will just perform all the complex movements I need to pull it off. My muscles may not be up to the challenge at first, but that’s fine. With willpower, I push my tissues to their limits, and they learn to do what I ask. By the principle of anti-fragility, my body automatically remodels itself, increasing strength, flexibility, or stamina precisely where they’re needed. It makes itself a better robot, one that can live the lifestyle my mind consciously chooses. These three learning processes work independently, yet together they make a dynamic human being, one that can just as well become a yogi, a warrior, a marathon runner, or a weightlifter.</p>



<p>Intelligence isn’t just about brains, it’s about bodies, too, and about multiple intelligent systems working together in complex ways. I hope this was a helpful example, but as always I’m looking for feedback. Is this an experience you can relate to? Have you observed these different systems within yourself? Do you think it helps to know what’s going on intellectually, or do you approach physical training in a different way? Any other thoughts or observations to share? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The first life was blind and ignorant. It was little more than a self-perpetuating chemical reaction, constantly rebuilding itself and making new copies. It had no idea where it was because it had no way to perceive the world around it. Even the very notion of existing and moving within a physical space was incomprehensible. It didn’t know what it was, or even <em>that</em> it was, because it had no way to perceive its inner life, either. It just kept on going, making copies of itself, frequently with errors that made it worse or (occasionally) better at being alive.</p>



<p>Eventually, by chance, life discovered something very useful: certain molecules change shape when something happens to them. Some respond to being hit with light, others change in response to temperature, or pressure, or brushing up against another molecule with just the right shape. Life learned to read these signs, understand them as clues about the world, analyze them, make decisions, and respond. At least, metaphorically speaking. In reality, we’re still just talking about chemical reactions here. One shape change might trigger another, which might cause some new protein molecule to be synthesized, or kick off a chain reaction that leads to a cell moving, adjusting its metabolism, or whatever. The cell acts <em>as if</em> it appreciated the meaning of this signal, but without “thinking” except in a purely mechanical way.</p>



<p>This was the origin of meaning. At first, it was a very primitive thing. Life learned to discriminate between “good” and “bad.” That is, it noticed signs correlated with favorable living conditions, survival, and reproduction. Organisms that sought out more “good” signals while avoiding “bad” signals tended to live longer and produce more offspring. In this way, evolution slowly transformed random patterns of stimulus and response into <em>instinct</em>, innate biases baked in from birth, representing a sort of ancestral “knowledge.” Over time, life evolved more nuanced concepts like: light and dark; warm and cold; food and poison; me, us, and them. Teasing apart these subtler shades of meaning helped life develop more complex and successful strategies to survive in the world.</p>



<p>Every organism has this sort of evolved map of meaning (an “innate ontology”), implicit in their genes. It’s defined by their senses, physical capabilities, reflexes, and gut feelings. That means every species has a profoundly different perspective on reality. Fish, for instance, may have no conception of water because to them it’s a lifelong constant with no alternative. However, they have a very nuanced sense of the information <em>carried in</em> the water, which we are totally blind to. They can be very sensitive to things like pressure, temperature, chemical concentrations, currents, and even electrical fields. To a limited extent, they instinctively “know” where these signs are coming from, what they foretell, and how to react.</p>



<p>Talking about “ontology” as something in our genes is a little unusual. Typically that word is applied minds, perhaps just human minds. It’s about how we perceive reality, dividing it up into objects, categories, and relationships. It’s how people fundamentally understand themselves and the world they live in, and it’s heavily influenced by culture. But philosophers like Daniel Dennett insist that the same concepts should be extended to precognitive life, as well. Our physical bodies lead us to perceive and think and act in human ways, laying a foundation upon which conscious learning and culture can build. In that view, our rich mental ontology is a product of evolution, constructed from lower-level, simpler, more instinctual parts that we share with many species.</p>



<p>Like the first living thing, each human is born into a new and unfamiliar world, forced to figure out how to survive from scratch. We do have a major leg up, though: we’re born with senses and instincts and the ability to move our bodies. Our nervous systems carry and integrate the sensations from our many cells to our brain as a coherent bundle of information. Our brains are highly structured, with all the tools we need to make sense of those signals set up and ready to go. For instance, our multi-stage vision pipeline takes in light signals from our optic nerve, then processes them to detect edges, shape, movement, and even faces <em>from day one</em>. As infants, we don’t know what these things mean yet, but our bodies present the information to our minds in a convenient form and draw our attention, making them quick and easy to learn.</p>



<p>But our innate ontology is very vague. We are born with a sort of “knowledge” (or at least a predisposition to learn) that we are bodies that can move around in a 3D world. That world is filled with objects we can interact with. Some of these objects can move, some are useful, and some are alive. We get tired, hungry, and sick. We need to breathe, drink, and eat other living things to survive. That’s all obvious from a very young age. The rest is on us to figure out. How do we tell friend from foe? How do we find shelter? What’s good to eat around here? How do we make a living? What is the purpose of our existence? These questions are context dependent and quick to change, so life hasn’t evolved answers for us. It can’t. Instead, it gave us brains so we could find our own answers.</p>



<p>What makes humans truly special, though, is that we don’t build our ontologies just by trial and error. We talk about our ontologies. We point things out, name them, tell stories, give demonstrations. We learn from our parents, peers, teachers, and the media. We’re immersed in the collective ontology of our species, something all of humanity has been cultivating for over a hundred thousand years. Our minds are built to soak it all in and to very quickly adopt a picture of reality that’s much richer, more accurate, and more nuanced than what’s available to any other species. Much more than any one human could possibly figure out in their lifetime.</p>



<p>This way of understanding reality is powerful, but it leads to a great big illusion: we tend to see our ontology <em>as reality itself</em>. That’s understandable. Our ontology is our window on the world. It encompasses everything we can perceive, understand, and do. Yet, it is not a real thing. It’s an image in our minds, our bodies, and our genes. It’s informed by our genetic ancestors, our senses, and what we’ve learned from each other. But we perceive much more than our senses actually take in. Our brains are running a sort of “image enhancement” algorithm, as seen in Sci Fi classics like <em>Blade Runner</em> and now made manifest by deep learning software. We take in a little data, then use our knowledge and expectations to extrapolate something much bigger, fuller, and richer, making up the details that we can’t directly perceive. That is, we see what we believe. We perceive concepts, not reality as it truly is.</p>



<p>Of course, if our ontology is not a real thing and lives inside our minds, the consequence is that every human being must have a <em>different</em> ontology. They are in many ways similar, sure. We are the same species, living in the same world, with the same basic needs. We may even be from the same community, with a shared culture. Yet, we might disagree about the meaning of important concepts like “freedom,” “equity,” and “justice.” We might have very different ideas about what money is, what purpose a government serves, or how to be a good person. These are not disagreements about facts, but about the structure of reality itself—the framework we use to fit facts together into a coherent picture. These disagreements are particularly hard to reconcile, since it’s hard to even <em>imagine</em> what doesn’t fit inside my ontology.</p>



<p>That was a bit of a whirlwind tour of ontology. I went fast and skipped over plenty, so I’ll ask: what would you like me to go deeper on? Is there anything that doesn’t make sense? Anything that fascinates or excites you? Let me know in the comments. If you’d like to learn more about ontology in its many forms and how it evolved, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526350023">From Bacteria to Bach and Back</a> by Daniel Dennett.</p>
