					<description><![CDATA[Hey Nate!  I&#039;m excited for you in your super-active deep immersion in graduate school and the way you describe it as a wild adventure with barely a map to be found.  And I like your comparisons of the busy schedule you have now to what you knew at Google!  It all makes perfect sense to me.  I feel like I shouldn&#039;t disturb you because you have a whole stack of books and papers and things stacked up waiting to be done and if I say hi too hard they&#039;ll all fall down all over your floor.  And you&#039;re always on the treadmill, and I don&#039;t envy you at the moment, but it sounds like you&#039;ve found the place you needed to be for your personal journey!

I have indeed enjoyed the blog.  And I&#039;d be happy to see some quick two-paragraph updates now and then.  As I see it, not every entry here needs to be an well crafted essay!  Though I like the polish you always put into your posts.

Good luck!]]></description>
