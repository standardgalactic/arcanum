The more closely a living being examines itself, the less clear become the boundaries between itself and the rest of existence.  At one moment, I might think of myself as just my conscious mind, as distinct from my subconscious.  At another time, I might not be able to think of an idea just now that I had an hour ago, but if I try, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get it back.  That idea lives in my mind somewhere; if it&#039;s not with me right now, where is it?  With something or someone else, it would seem.  That which I have command of right now, at this moment, can seem arbitrarily small depending on how finely I view the moment.

It&#039;s all right, though.  It&#039;s not as if I can think of a better way for things to be.  And yes, when I wrote the pinball analogy, I meant it to carry some beauty. :~)]]></description>

Part of why I like &quot;free will is being the source of our actions&quot; is that it captures the essential contradiction of the concept. It&#039;s problematic in the same way &quot;free will&quot; is, but very clearly and with few words.

For the record, I&#039;ve been reading a lot of philosophy of mind that generally includes unconscious acts as &quot;behaviors.&quot; But I suppose word usage all depends on context and purpose.

I can see how the infinite regress you describe is distressing. I also find it rather beautiful, because it explains how life is possible at all! We are this infinite regress, reaching out from bare physics towards ever greater understanding, intention, and influence. It will never be &quot;pure reason&quot; in the classical sense, but the fact that the Universe turns itself into something sorta like that is pretty incredible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/11/14/free-will/comment-page-1/#comment-232&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Hmm, I can&#039;t reply to Nate&#039;s reply for some reason.  I wonder if these threads are capped at three replies deep.  I still hope to hear from Rachel Grey, but in response to Nate:

&quot;Some people say that if you don’t believe in free will, then you will lose all sense of accountability for your actions. You might give into all your worst impulses because, that’s just how you are, there’s no use in fighting it, and nothing matters anyway.&quot; I&#039;ve encountered this idea, but it seems like a deep misunderstanding.  For one thing, it behooves one to ask what the purpose of accountability is.  To take a simple example, a parent finds their child&#039;s room is a mess and says &quot;If you don&#039;t keep it clean, you won&#039;t get an allowance.&quot;  The parent has motivated the child to clean their room, and there&#039;s no need to imagine the child&#039;s will is free.  So long as you allow that the child is more likely to clear their room after hearing their parent&#039;s ultimatum, you have a case where it makes sense for the child to do the responsible thing.

But aside from that... if you really did find yourself in a situation where it doesn&#039;t matter at all what you do, why would you then choose to give in to your worst impulses?  Why not give in to your best impulses, or go with a totally random mix?  The idea that if what you do doesn&#039;t matter, you should do the most tempting, short-sighted things is making the assumption that the delight you get from doing those things DOES still matter--the things that don&#039;t matter are apparently the long-term benefits of being moral and responsible.  Why would it break down that way?

It seems like people who take that stance must believe, for whatever reason, that moral behavior is generally better than immoral behavior, EXCEPT that it&#039;s useless if it isn&#039;t freely chosen, in which case immoral behavior wins the day.  And I&#039;ll add that even making that calculation and acting on it in order to choose the immoral behavior seems a lot like a freely made choice, which contradicts the premise of free will being absent.

&quot;If you think of your actions in terms of free will, then intentions matter more than outcomes. You made the right choice, and if it didn’t work out, that was just factors &#039;beyond your control.&#039;”  I think intentions matter more than outcomes in situations where a person&#039;s intentions will probably shape their actions rather accurately in the future.  If you try to murder someone but narrowly fail, it makes sense for society to punish you--I would say just as much as if you&#039;d succeeded.  On the other hand, if you want to make money for your company but your hapless incompetence keeps making your attempts backfire, then your intentions aren&#039;t very reliable shapers of your actions in that context, in which case it makes sense for people to weigh your outcomes more heavily than your intentions.  As a result, maybe you lose your job or at least don&#039;t get a promotion.

So, I think freedom of will is irrelevant to the intentions versus outcomes debate, unless you consider it to be already folded into the considerations I just described.  You could say that a person good at carrying out plans has &quot;freer will&quot; than a person who just keeps making the same mistakes.  In that case, free will isn&#039;t a binary that exists or not, but rather exists on a quantitative spectrum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see “free will is being the source of our actions” as a bit tautological.  Of the many actions I take part in, which of them are &#039;mine&#039;?  If I trip and fall, was the tripping my action?  Was the falling my action, or was it an act of gravity?

It reminds me of how I took a class on Animal Behavior, and on the first day, the professor asked us to define behavior.  &quot;Is going into labor and bearing children a behavior?&quot; he asked.  I was tempted to say that an animal&#039;s behaviors are those things it does that pass through its consciousness--things that it&#039;s aware of.  I felt like he would pick it apart somehow, and others had things to say, so I didn&#039;t speak up just then.  But this way of drawing the line still feels about right to me.  Similarly, we might choose to define &#039;our&#039; actions as the ones we originate--the ones that pass through and are the product of our wills.  But then, we are by definition the source of our own actions.  Whether our wills are free or not doesn&#039;t enter into it.

&quot;To some extent, we really are just watching ourselves, figuring out who we are, what we’re capable of, what impact we’ll have as our life unfolds. Yet, we can steer. That matters a lot.&quot;  Yes, I am the steerer, but I am also the steeree.  And my steering self is also steered, and so is the steerer who steers it.

Another way of putting the idea that chills me sometimes is: Everything in my control stems ultimately from something out of my control.  And indeed, normally you don&#039;t have to go back far at all to find that something.

&quot;I guess I’ve just come to think of myself as “co-created,” in a partnership between myself, the physical world, and the social world.&quot;  Yes, I like that conceptualization.  We are co-authors of ourselves.  We collaborate with reality to create ourselves.  We are the shooters of our own pinballs and on occasion, we moonlight as the designers of the machine.  We tinker, we tilt.  We find ourselves in a larger machine, tilting us.  We find the room itself is connected to the machine we&#039;re playing.  We play ourselves.  We find ourselves eternally being played.]]></description>

You might give into all your worst impulses because, that&#039;s just how you are, there&#039;s no use in fighting it, and nothing matters anyway. Like, just the worst form of nihilism. In practice, though, who but a sociopath would do that? The actual determinists I know are nothing like that.

There&#039;s a counterpoint for the free-will-believers, though, which I definitely have seen. If you think of your actions in terms of free will, then intentions matter more than outcomes. You made the right choice, and if it didn&#039;t work out, that was just factors &quot;beyond your control.&quot; Taking steps to anticipate and manage those external factors to improve your odds of success would be like admitting that you&#039;re not in control.]]></description>

What a lovely, thoughtful reply! Thanks for sharing, especially the rather personal bits.

Heh, I guess I didn&#039;t even notice that I didn&#039;t formally define &quot;free will.&quot; Reflecting on that, I suppose it&#039;s because I consider it contextual. Like, is there a situation to analyze where agency plays an important role? Then we can talk about agency and responsibility in that context. But I feel uncomfortable making blanket statements any more specific than what I wrote in this post, partly because the concept is so nebulous! My main point in writing this was just that: rather than asking is &quot;free will true or false?&quot; we should instead be talking about what we really mean in more concrete terms. Maybe there shouldn&#039;t be a single word or phrase for this.

Of all those definitions, &quot;free will is being the source of our actions&quot; is my favorite. I think this word exists because people want to maintain the illusion that they are in control of their lives.
 
I really love your point that &lt;i&gt;we are&lt;/i&gt; part of the state of the Universe. That&#039;s such a nice way of putting it, and it highlights the absurdity of the question.

I can certainly relate to your recent difficulties with determinism. That sounds hard to face, but I think you&#039;re approaching it with the right mindset. To some extent, we really are just watching ourselves, figuring out who we are, what we&#039;re capable of, what impact we&#039;ll have as our life unfolds. Yet, we can steer. That matters a lot. I guess I&#039;ve just come to think of myself as &quot;co-created,&quot; in a partnership between myself, the physical world, and the social world. But I can see why that might be a hard pill to swallow for many...

Hmm. So, if I write less, you write more? Seems like I oughta capitalize on that.  :)]]></description>

My main point in writing this was just that: rather than asking is &#8220;free will true or false?&#8221; we should instead be talking about what we really mean in more concrete terms. Maybe there shouldn&#8217;t be a single word or phrase for this.</p>
<p>Of all those definitions, &#8220;free will is being the source of our actions&#8221; is my favorite. I think this word exists because people want to maintain the illusion that they are in control of their lives.</p>
<p>I really love your point that <i>we are</i> part of the state of the Universe. That&#8217;s such a nice way of putting it, and it highlights the absurdity of the question.</p>
<p>I can certainly relate to your recent difficulties with determinism. That sounds hard to face, but I think you&#8217;re approaching it with the right mindset. To some extent, we really are just watching ourselves, figuring out who we are, what we&#8217;re capable of, what impact we&#8217;ll have as our life unfolds. Yet, we can steer. That matters a lot. I guess I&#8217;ve just come to think of myself as &#8220;co-created,&#8221; in a partnership between myself, the physical world, and the social world. But I can see why that might be a hard pill to swallow for many&#8230;</p>
<p>Hmm. So, if I write less, you write more? Seems like I oughta capitalize on that.  🙂</p>

I think your point about our emotions being &quot;tied in a tight loop with our decision-making processes&quot; is very similar to the point I just made in my long response to Nate&#039;s post.  Well said.

I agree that free will, as I&#039;ve typically thought about the term, is a fairly explicit endorsement of dualism rather than a secret one.  But it really seems like everyone means something a little different when they talk about it.

There was a line on a radio show from around 1990 that struck me, despite its simplicity, as nicely profound, delivered languorously as it was into the blackness of an independent radio show recorded on cassette and replayed at night, in an episode that discussed, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, what future technology might bring for people and how we think:

&quot;Have you ever asked yourself: &#039;Where do my thoughts come from?&#039;&quot;

It&#039;s worth asking and marveling!  Often, we can tell where our thoughts come from.  At other times, we get the sensation of something popping into our heads.  And at still other times, we don&#039;t even think to stop and wonder.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve long found the idea of &quot;free will&quot; a bit silly in terms of how much focus it gets as an idea, versus how much relevance it actually has.  People (at least in fiction) are always asking &quot;Do you believe in free will,&quot; but rarely explain what they mean by that.  I would be inclined to mutter &quot;Not really&quot; with a shrug, and then ask in a low, offhand tone: &quot;Free from what?&quot;

Searching the web suggests the answer isn&#039;t any clearer than I expected.  Oxford Definitions suggests it means freedom from &quot;necessity or fate.&quot;  Dictionary.com says it means that our behavior &quot;expresses personal choice and is not simply determined by physical or divine forces.&quot;  Merriam-Webster calls it our freedom &quot;to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention.&quot;  One article equates it to &quot;&#039;moral liberty&#039; - the capacity to discern and pursue the good, instead of merely being compelled by appetites and desires.&quot;  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls it &quot;a particular sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives,&quot; but acknowledges that different philosophers define this capacity differently.  Some of the suggested options include:  “Free Will is the power of up-to-usness.&quot;  &quot;Free Will is being the source of our actions.&quot;  If we have free will, we are &quot;agents capable of influencing the world in various ways.&quot;  &quot;An agent [...] is able to do other than what she does.”  Hopefully I don&#039;t need to deconstruct all these definitions to make it clear they&#039;re not synonymous!

It seems to me that &quot;free will&quot; is something similar to &quot;love&quot; in that people love to talk about it, define it and debate it; not only is there no universal definition of either idea, but many people seem to find the wobbliness of their definitions romantic.

I don&#039;t have a lot of use for the concept, and part of the reason is that it seems like even people&#039;s attempts to define it often involve muddled thinking.  (I notice that you didn&#039;t really provide an explicit definition, even though you mentioned the importance of good definitions in philosophy.)  &quot;Are our actions pre-determined by the current state of the universe, or are they up to us?&quot; is one way someone might pose the quandary.  But it&#039;s not like that&#039;s a real dichotomy; it could very well be that both are true.  -We- are part of the state of the universe, and therefore we may indeed make our own decisions even while those decisions are also theoretically determinable by our present body and brain state.  Similarly, someone might lament: &quot;What does it matter what I do, if I&#039;m going to just end up making the same decisions no matter what?&quot;  This is faulty reasoning; if you expand &quot;no matter what&quot; to &quot;no matter what I decide to do,&quot; it&#039;s easy to see that you won&#039;t make the same decisions &quot;no matter what you decide&quot;; rather, your decisions depend on your prior decisions, your thought processes, and so on--in short, what you do depends on you, no matter how predictable -you- might be.

Some of the given definitions of free will may be useful, though, certainly.  But often I think it&#039;s just put forward as the alternative to determinism, or possibly as the third alternative to determinism and determinism-plus-randomness.  Which is why I&#039;m more inclined to just talk about determinism... which, interestingly, has been on my mind a lot in the last year or so, even though I had no knowledge of Sapolsky&#039;s book and haven&#039;t heard people talking about the concept.

The idea of reality being deterministic never used to bother me, at least not once I grasped the basic idea.  I remember having a conversation about it with a fellow philosophy major by the mailboxes in college; he was upset at the idea because it seemed to make everything pointless, and I demonstrated why that wasn&#039;t the case.  And while quantum mechanics and Godelian paradox may throw wrinkles into the deterministic concept, what determinability the world may possess wasn&#039;t a lodestone for me... until recently.  In this last year or three, it&#039;s started to haunt me now and then.  As an example, when cannabis gummies became legal in my area, I tried one, and had a rough night in which I pummeled myself with horrifying &#039;philosophical truths&#039;, chief among which was the idea that I couldn&#039;t ever be proud of anything (in some deep sense) because everything I was ever going to do was pre-destined.  I&#039;m not excited to chew another one of those.

In recent months, determinism has become an idea that bothers me for no rational reason.  As you point out, no ultragenius entity is -actually- predicting people, and if it were, it would have to be hidden away somewhere completely irrelevant to us, or we&#039;d know about it.  There are rationales behind feeling pride that determinism doesn&#039;t negate (though this didn&#039;t stop me from making it an unsettling theme in my 2020 NaNovel).  Determinism doesn&#039;t negate the &quot;up-to-usness&quot; of the world, which I guess is the main point of your post.  It doesn&#039;t obliviate moral liberty.  So why does it continually bother me?

I think a big part of it concerns the nature of our minds and our reckoning, independent of free or unfree will, with how very little we have direct control over.  Our abilities to control our bodies, environments OR minds are so small compared to our bodies, minds and environment themselves.  I have physical control over such a very small portion of my bodily systems, and likewise, I have mental control over such a small portion of my brain&#039;s mental processes.  From an engineering perspective, this kind of has to be the case.  Imagine trying to write a computer program that has the complete ability to rewrite itself... without the tremendous likelihood that this computer program will quickly break.  Imagine trying to watch the mechanisms of your brain displayed on a screen and UNDERSTAND them in real time.  Of course we can&#039;t do that.  That&#039;s something that I, and everyone else, need to come to terms with.

What does that have to do with determinism?  Well, if I&#039;m having fun meeting some challenge, making choices about my life and so on, I may suddenly be struck by a big emotional blow when I think--All these things you&#039;re doing and choices you&#039;re making--they&#039;re all perfectly predictable to someone with enough information, they&#039;re all pre-destined from the right point of view.  And that means that all I&#039;m ever doing is... watching myself making decisions.  Can everything be reduced to just... testing how well my personal nature and strategies work out in the actual world, and being fascinated by the results of those tests?  I mean, that sounds nice, but one would hope LIFE is more than just that.

I think the big insight that makes this line of thinking bearable is that we don&#039;t -just- watch ourselves go; rather, we control ourselves along the way.  We make decisions, and we DO have some control over the kind of decisions we make, because we are self-monitoring beings, we have egos and superegos, we have morals and guiding principles.  We can habituate ourselves into or out of patterns; we can think about things until our decision-making processes change.  But then, when we do all that, I may lament, I&#039;m -still- just watching myself do things, but on another level.  Except that I&#039;m not, because the decisions I make about how to change my decision-making are themselves things I can change by changing myself.

And so on.

I have a small amount of control over the world, and a smaller amount of control over how I choose to control the world, and an even smaller amount of control over how I choose to control how I choose to control the world, and an even smaller amount of control over how I choose to do that.  Ad messy infinitum.  And these various levels of control over control aren&#039;t distinct, for better or worse--they&#039;re slippery and messy and intermixed.  Which is a saving grace, really, that keeps the whole thing from collapsing into a sort of endlessly nesting spectation of our own lives.  We live our lives, and a large portion of our existences consists of being spectators to ourselves, watching ourselves go... but we are -active- spectators in an interactive show, and that, interestingly, to me at least, makes all the difference.

I&#039;ll end this by saying that I appreciate this exploratory shorter post of yours, even if I replied with a tremendously big answer.  Just think how much more I might have felt moved to say if your post had been twice as long.  Chances are, I would have held a lot of it back, and we wouldn&#039;t have wanted that, now would we? :-]]]></description>

That&#039;s a really nice way of looking at it, Mike! Thanks for sharing.

We have will. We used to think of that as imposed by a transcendent force, and now we mostly think of it as generated by the brain. Some people have a hard time reconciling their experience with &quot;will&quot; with the brain as a machine, but perhaps that&#039;s just because the brain is a very different kind of machine that most of the ones we interact with. Is will free? Well, no, it&#039;s constrained. Or, yes, we it&#039;s free within some bounds which are the limits of our ability to predict. It&#039;s only this hard definition of &quot;free&quot; meaning &quot;unbound by causality&quot; which is problematic.]]></description>
