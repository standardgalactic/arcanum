For what it&#039;s worth, this video is the one I have been using to introduce folks to Levin&#039;s work. I like it because it provides a great, whirlwind, mind-blowing overview of the biological experiments, but then it culminates in his new &quot;TAME&quot; framework and ideas about &quot;agential materials&quot;. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOHSUMb214]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/03/01/the-age-of-microbes/comment-page-1/#comment-141&quot;&gt;Jeff Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.

Welcome, Jeff, and thanks for sharing your thoughts!

I agree, the latent abilities of cells and human tissues are an extremely exciting area to explore. For instance, I&#039;ve been fascinated by the work of Mike Levin and colleagues on regenerative medicine and &quot;Xenobots.&quot; They are largely focused on coaxing cells into activating unused pathways and behaving / evolving in particular directions that they wouldn&#039;t naturally. It&#039;s early days, but they already have some really extraordinary results. For anyone interested, here&#039;s a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/cells-form-into-xenobots-on-their-own-20210331/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://manyminds.libsyn.com/mind-everywhere&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, there are limits to what biology can do. I don&#039;t want to give the impression that we could give people any superpower we want just by unlocking the right genes. For example: breathing under water. It&#039;s probably &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; possible to enable humans to breathe water like fish, because anatomically speaking our ears evolved from gills. That means the relevant &quot;recipes&quot; have probably all been rewritten and repurposed for hearing, or wouldn&#039;t work any more because the anatomical context has changed so much. That&#039;s just one example of how recipes get lost, and how evolution constrains the possible future paths of an organism. Of course, that doesn&#039;t mean we could never coax our bodies to metabolize oxygen in other ways.  :)

Ending aging is another interesting example. Cells have &lt;i&gt;incredibly&lt;/i&gt; complex and sophisticated mechanisms for managing DNA, but they could always be better. Evolution has optimized these systems to balance costs against benefits. It pays to be really, really good, but perfect is prohibitively expensive. More accurately, perfect is impossible. So, there might already be folks with improved telomeres that age less and live longerâ€”just not indefinitely. Maybe that accounts for some of the centenarians we see? But there may not be enough selective pressure to spread those genes through the population. Maybe humans already live long enough, as far as evolution is concerned. Of course, we can absolutely engineer cells to do things they weren&#039;t evolved to do, it&#039;s just very hard because human bodies are so incredibly complex.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First time I&#039;ve read one of your blog posts, and wow, there&#039;s a lot to unpack here!  I was especially interested in the part about DNA being a collection of recipes for cells to build proteins... It really makes you wonder if there&#039;s a way we could take control of that to allow rapid changes to our own bodies.  For instance healing damage to our bodies in a more natural way, but also creating ways to better adapt to our environment like allowing fishermen to breathe in water so a passing storm is no longer a danger.

There is a theory that evolution should have equipped at least some people over the millennia with the ability to not age, so where are they?  The path to this would likely be in protecting the ends of our DNA strands so they never degrade, and that seems like something which our protein factory should be capable of, if it had the recipe.  I think what people overlook is that not aging is not the same thing as immortality, and with the brutal history of mankind there is no reason to believe that anyone with such a mutation could actually survive without being very very lucky.  Still, solving the DNA problem would be a great first step and if people knew they could potentially live forever, they might not be willing to throw their lives away in pointless wars or risky behaviors.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing!

Yeah, I think it&#039;s really exciting to think about natural selection affecting life in many ways, at multiple scales. Your examples are excellent. There are also folks who see decision making or design as a sort of competition and selection between thoughts in the mind. At ASU, I even heard about folks combining this idea with game theory and oncology. When it comes to active diseases like cancer, every treatment is an opportunity for the enemy to react. If cancer&#039;s main way of reacting is to &lt;i&gt;evolve&lt;/i&gt;, that tells us something about what moves it is likely to make and when. So, how do we design a treatment such that the cancer evolves itself into a corner, rather than toward immunity and proliferation?

If you&#039;re interested in how genetic factors interact with other kinds of animal intelligence, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526346279&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Evolution in Four Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;. That book goes into a lot of depth about how behavior, understanding, environmental modifications, and culture all join forces with genetics to guide development and evolution.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your mention of the speed at which natural selection can operate for microbes set off an interesting train of thought for me. We tend to think of biological natural selection as something &quot;much slower&quot; than the processes of a mind, but there is in fact quite a lot of overlap in their respective windows of operation. It is not hard to find at least a few examples where the two modes of problem solving are in competition (e.g. drug-resistant disease strains, pesticide and herbicide resistance), or where one is subservient to the other. Minds, materialistically speaking, are employed by natural evolution, but also we have minds engineering environments to guide natural selection (so-called artificial selection).

We also tend to think of natural selection as something that &quot;doesn&#039;t happen&quot; in a multi-cellular creature like ourselves... The obvious exception that comes to mind is tumour growth, which we see as pathological, but the beneficial instances are probably more interesting.

I recall in (I think) The Symbolic Species, a section on how a version of &quot;natural selection&quot; likely guides the early development of the brain. With the increased interest in the micro-biome that we host, there are probably other examples of natural-selection processes that &quot;solve problems for us&quot; in ways that somewhat challenge the idea of a fixed genotype even within a single human organism. It also wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some amount of &quot;genetic&quot; natural selection even within the human cells can be observed, possibly mediated by epigenetic diversification rather than mutation of the base DNA.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading this article, Nate, because it was beautifully-written, clear and understandable for me.  The visual images, metaphors and numerical comparisons helped me to imagine the  ideas you presented.
The questions it raises: How does life know what to do and how and when to do it?  What is that intelligence?  Where does it reside? Is it the same as that which allows us and not other creatures on the planet to observe it and come to understand it, or is that something different?
Thank you for sharing  this brilliance.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I enjoyed reading this article, Nate, because it was beautifully-written, clear and understandable for me.  The visual images, metaphors and numerical comparisons helped me to imagine the  ideas you presented.<br />
The questions it raises: How does life know what to do and how and when to do it?  What is that intelligence?  Where does it reside? Is it the same as that which allows us and not other creatures on the planet to observe it and come to understand it, or is that something different?<br />
Thank you for sharing  this brilliance.</p>
