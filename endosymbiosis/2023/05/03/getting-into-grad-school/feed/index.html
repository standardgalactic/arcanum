					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/05/03/getting-into-grad-school/comment-page-1/#comment-169&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Ha! Thanks for sharing your swimmy notion of what grad school is. Honestly, that&#039;s a lot like how I saw it, and how I &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; see it! I didn&#039;t give a very clear accounting of what grad school &quot;really is&quot; &#039;cuz I haven&#039;t figured that out yet. If anything, my experience so far suggests there&#039;s no one answer.  :)

It&#039;s interesting how schools vary in size, and some are focused more on research (ie, more grad students) or on education (ie, more undergrads). That can even vary from department to department. It&#039;s an important distinction, with deep consequences for the culture of the school and who will succeed there, but it&#039;s usually only communicated in terms of enrollment numbers. It&#039;s up to you to understand the significance of those numbers, which... I still don&#039;t, at least not fully. It seems complex.

I was also surprised at the challenge of finding a lab with the right viewpoint. I guess it depends on how opinionated you are going in. I had strong opinions about what I want to do and what AI research ought to be, and so it was important to find a place where that ideology is accepted. It would be very different for a naive student. They&#039;d be less concerned about joining any old lab, but then they might discover later they have philosophical differences. Or worse, that they&#039;ve internalized things from their lab&#039;s culture that they later consider harmful.

I wish there were a better way of guiding potential grad students to the kind of experience that&#039;s right for them. As best I can tell, it&#039;s usually on the student to figure this all out for themselves.

Thanks for your encouragement! Difficult as it was, I think it went well, and I&#039;m very excited for UVM.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is all a very interesting account!  Since I never had any specific career plans in college, I never went to grad school--what kind of program would I have applied to?  I had only a swimmy notion of what graduate school is, but I expected it was something less swimmy in real life.  Apparently not!

I have to admit, your long post on the general nature of grad school still left me unclear of just how it works.  Okay, it&#039;s more focused on independent initiative and research than on following rules, but... are there classes?  I searched online and found that, yes, there are classes.  Who teaches the classes?  How does that connect to work with your advisor?  I guess I&#039;m thinking of my vague sense of the experience of students at higher universities in Europe in the Renaissance era, as portrayed in movies and biographies of famous thinkers, where they&#039;re kind of able to do whatever they want if they can persuade the professors and regents to let them, but at the same time they always have huge piles of books to sort through tiresomely in dim libraries with spectacles falling off their faces and candles burning down and their heads weary upon their sleeve.  But there&#039;s also big amphitheaters full of professors shouting exciting things and then they go to talk to those professors and get skeptically rebuffed and have to convince them to... maybe it&#039;s like that.

I went once with a friend of mine to visit a big college with thousands of undergrads but, oddly, only like 15 graduate students.  There was a group of prospective students, I think, but he was the only graduate candidate, and had to ask the unusual questions.  It was like it was a shadow biome hidden in the crevices of &quot;normal college,&quot; where hidden older people conduct hidden studies.  Like a secret restaurant menu.  Like a staircase for staff only you never knew was tucked between the public halls.

It&#039;s also interesting that you had to learn about which schools were compatible with your viewpoint, rather than just going to the &quot;best&quot; schools, or ever the ones with the best program in your (adopted) field.  That sounds like a tricky search indeed--not one for an inexperienced youth, as Michael pointed out--and I guess the best way to conduct it is to talk to the professors who are actually there.  So I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve had a chance to do that, and I hope you&#039;ve done your research right!]]></description>

Yeah. I guess another big takeaway for me is the grad school experience doesn&#039;t seem to be for the students so much as for the University. The labs need workers and (very few) future leaders, and grad school is about producing those. Some advisors care a lot about giving their students personal support in finding a long-term home in academia or industry, but that&#039;s not at all guaranteed. Undergrad students are treated like paying customers, given a clear path and all the support they could want, but when that&#039;s over, they&#039;re kinda just... cut loose. Grad school &lt;i&gt;feels like&lt;/i&gt; a way to ease that transition, but it&#039;s not meant to serve that purpose. Honestly, in some cases it almost feels like a bait and switch.  :(]]></description>

I also specifically remember the lack of familiarity with career being a serious problem for people if they were faced with the prospect of leaving. I know quite a few people who recognized that grad school was not working out for them, but put off leaving (for years!) because they were afraid of joining the working world.]]></description>

I sure hope you&#039;re right about the grad school process being suited to folks in middle age.  :)

Good point about treating grad school as a continuation of undergrad. Certainly, that&#039;s how I thought of it at first. I met several fresh grad students who seemed like they just coasted from one world into the other without much consideration. The labs are probably happy for the warm bodies, but it seems like a rough transition for the students. Grad school is about learning to work independently on productive research, not following the curriculum and getting good grades. Seems like the assumption is that grad students will learn autonomy, find their passion, and figure out how to do science in the PhD process, or they&#039;ll drop out and won&#039;t be a problem for the school any more. I&#039;m grateful to have 2 out of 3 of those worked out already, but it&#039;s a lot to expect from a young student who&#039;s been trained to play the &quot;good grades game&quot; and probably doesn&#039;t even have enough job experience to know if they want a career in science.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My only thought is that I wish grad school were not sold so much as a natural continuation of undergrad. It is very messy, and (often) not a good on-ramp for working life. As much as I am critical of the MBA concept, I do specifically like their preference for taking on students after they have built up some non-academic experience, skills and perspective.

The journey you have described makes a lot of sense to me, but it is a very difficult thing for most young inexperienced people to do. I personally wish it were not something expected of the young, but rather something we treated as more appropriate for people closer to their middle age, with a bit more security and wisdom to help them find the right place.]]></description>
