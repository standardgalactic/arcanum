Delightful thoughts!

I love how you talk about the many different ways we conceptualize a person, from different perspectives and levels of abstraction. They&#039;re all useful and reliable in some context, but none fully captures the person. I think all of reality is like that!

I also like your point about folk sayings. They&#039;re a bit different, since they&#039;re not quite about describing reality. They&#039;re more like bits of narrative, or framing devices, which I think should probably also count as &quot;ontological.&quot; They&#039;re useful for telling the story of what&#039;s happening now and what you should do next. As you point out, they aren&#039;t logical, so you&#039;d never arrive at one by reasoning. They&#039;re more about taking on a role, or turning a gut feeling into a tangible argument.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/02/01/in-every-mind-a-universe/comment-page-1/#comment-129&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

I admit my use of the word &quot;ontology&quot; is a bit non-standard. I guess I mean any symbolic model of reality, including domain-specific ones, personal ones, communal ones, etc. This was useful for the main point I wanted to make: we think of the world as really existing in a clear and well-defined way, but the way we parse the world is based on these models, there are &lt;i&gt;lots and lots&lt;/i&gt; of them, and none of them is objectively true.

I think you bring up some good examples, like when people use words or acronyms that another person doesn&#039;t know, or has a different definition for. That is what I&#039;m trying to talk about, I&#039;m just adding an extra layer of abstraction. Often we  think of reality as &lt;i&gt;being made up of&lt;/i&gt; objects, concepts, and categories. From that perspective, an ontology is like a master dictionary. It names all the things that exist, and every person has memorized parts of that dictionary, perhaps incorrectly. Instead, I&#039;m arguing that reality exists, but objects, concepts, and categories &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;/i&gt;. They&#039;re just useful fictions we made up in order to organize reality, break it down, and make it less overwhelming. There is no master dictionary. Each person makes up their own, and the true miracle of human communication is that there&#039;s enough agreement between them that we can talk about reality and (for the most part)  understand each other unambiguously.

You bring up a cool point about how people might have fundamentally different ways of conceptualizing abstract ideas. We may agree on the word, or even be able to write compatible definitions, but the &quot;raw form&quot; of the idea in our heads might be radically different, perhaps using different modalities (visual vs. emotional) or brain regions. I think it&#039;s pretty amazing to realize how much variation there is across minds, and how different our experience of reality must be.  :)]]></description>

Yes, the idea of ontologies as tools we pull out when we need them, but which may contradict each other, resonates with me.  It reminds me of how we can see people on a very personal level, as they connect and compare to ourselves, but we can also see other people as part of general social groups and trends, or as animals with a few extra intellectual features, or as biological systems controlled by hormones and brains and evolution, or even as physical systems controlled on the atomic level by physical laws.  The impressions we get from these levels of modeling may be hard to reconcile, or even contradict, but they can all be useful.

Likewise, I&#039;m reminded of how there are adages and cliches that run contrary to each other in attitude, but one or another may be useful for different situations; one for when you need to be brave (&quot;fortune favors the bold&quot;), another for when you need to be cautious (&quot;don&#039;t count your chickens before they&#039;ve hatched.&quot;)  To use one or another of these sayings is to select an ontology (I guess) for the current situation and use folk wisdom to fortify it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems like this post centers around the concept of ontologies as a countable noun, which I&#039;m not really familiar with.  As I mentioned in chat, I&#039;ve only ever understood &#039;ontology&#039; to mean the inquiry into what exists, not something that a person can possess.  The various dictionary definitions aren&#039;t terribly clear, along the lines of, &quot;a description or model of the parts and connections that make up a particular field of knowledge or practice.&quot;  An example or two would go a long way to clear that up!  Well, I own From Bacteria to Bach and Back now, so eventually I will undoubtedly read it and understand what you&#039;re talking about.

I can largely grasp the idea, though.  It seems like an ontology is a lot like a worldview, but maybe only for a particular subset of the world and maybe with a particular focus on categorization.  If you think of people as belonging to particular groups (nice ones versus dangerous; belonging to the right religion versus the wrong religion versus potentially convertible; sports people versus tech people versus popular culture people versus whatever), then that may be an ontology, or part of one.  Yes... it&#039;s interesting to think of how tricky it may be to distinguish between that which is objectively out there and that which we&#039;ve read onto reality, perhaps because we were taught it, but which other people might read differently.  Sometimes people casually use categorizing terms as if they just see them without thinking, but I may not be aware of those categories at all, or they may seem obscure.  Like when people use acronyms to save time and others don&#039;t know what they stand for.  I&#039;m having trouble thinking of examples.  Ontologies themselves may not be part of my ontology.  Ah, well, political designations like &#039;neo-liberal&#039; or &#039;anarchocommunist&#039; or &#039;reactionary&#039; may be very familiar to some people but largely opaque to others, who would classify the same groups and people differently.

By pointing out that we may see &#039;freedom&#039;, &#039;equality&#039; and &#039;justice&#039; in different ways, it makes me wonder - what comes to mind for other people when they hear an abstract term like that?  Is it common to have an image to stand in for ideas like this?  The scales of justice in front of a Roman courthouse, perhaps?  Are visual thinkers likely to have icons of that kind while others have a different reaction, maybe one that&#039;s more purely emotional?  Should we be talking more about things like, &quot;When I hear &#039;equality&#039;, I think of...&quot;?]]></description>

I watched an old video of his that briefly sums up some of his key ideas: https://youtu.be/uArSolZX19U

That video, at least, is about whether the Universe is fundamentally physical or mental in nature. I&#039;ll admit, I&#039;m pretty biased towards the Materialist perspective, that reality is out there and our mental experience is a representation of that reality. That&#039;s just how I was raised, and it&#039;s the starting point for most science. However, I also see the appeal of Idealism. After all, our mental experience is all we have access to, and physical reality can only be inferred from that!

My first reaction to this is, why not both? I see the Universe as complex and multifaceted, and there are many ways to describe its reality that are equally valid. We can talk about reality as being built up out of matter, yet that matter is emergent from the interactions of fundamental forces on the quantum level. We can talk about reality in terms of meaning, intention, and relationships, yet none of those can manifest or interact without matter as a substrate. Which is more fundamental? Seems like a silly question to me. I think the important thing is that, even if you think of mind as emerging from matter, that doesn&#039;t make it any less &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt;. It&#039;s &quot;just&quot; an ephemeral pattern in the properties of matter, not a physical thing itself, but so is a computer program or a mathematical concept. We experience those things, they influence reality, and they have practical value to us. I don&#039;t see the value in arguing they are somehow less significant or valid because they aren&#039;t concrete matter. Scientists focus on what is measurable, of course, but it would be foolish to say what we cannot measure does not exist!

Anyway, that&#039;s my 2 cents, and some context for other readers who might want to check out his work.]]></description>

Good point. You remind me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4489618852&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Representation and Reality&lt;/a&gt;, which argues very clearly that all language is self-referential in nature. It&#039;s just a web of abstractions and relationships between them that may or may not be aligned with &quot;reality,&quot; which we do not have access to.

I think it&#039;s an interesting and very plausible idea that most / all of the mind&#039;s contents are ontological in nature. In that case, bare facts might just be degenerate categories that contain one member, with properties defined in terms of relationships to other facts. That reminds me of computational ideas like the lambda calculus, where whole computer programs, including numbers, can be expressed using functions.

If we take that perspective, then I think my previous comment is more about coarse vs. fine grain changes in ontology. In some cases, learning takes place exclusively at the fine-grain level, filling in the details of a well established representation of reality. In other cases, learning forces you to massively remodel your ontology, making room for lots of new facts and resolving all the most troublesome contradictions until you&#039;re pretty good at intuitively understanding and predicting the behavior of the system.

So, I guess the impact of learning on your ontology depends on what you learn, and in particular on how diverse your education is. The structure you end up with reflects the learning process that constructed it and the dataset it was &quot;trained&quot; on.]]></description>

Thanks for the compliment! I&#039;ve never heard of Bernardo Kastrup. Is there any of his work I ought to check out?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nate, I&#039;m guessing you must be aware of the work of Bernardo Kastrup.  I was listening to a videotaped interview of him and it certainly seemed like you and he are cut from the same loaf of bread. Your thinking is rich, stimulating and clear.  Speak to you soon.

What if there is no such thing as &quot;learning a fact?&quot;, it&#039;s all just ontology adjustment somehow? Or does your working definition of ontology prevent that?

If I memorize a song, or speech, I don&#039;t seem to be remembering all the words... many of the words I can only remember in sequence with the words that come before, as if I&#039;m learning how to move from one phrase to another, without learning the phrases themselves (excepting a few anchor-points).]]></description>
