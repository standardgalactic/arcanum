					<description><![CDATA[o it is octopus thinkr !

YAY!  Congratulations on making a decision you seem happy with.  I looked at the Xenobots article and it certainly seems really cool and promising.  So you&#039;ll get to dip into the mysterious soup of tiny interactions that is cellular logic!  I look forward to hearing about that, and about your new position and colleagues, and about Burlington.

Josh Bongard isn&#039;t related to Mikhail Moiseevich Bongard, the inventor of Bongard problems, is he?  How cool would that be?]]></description>

Thanks!

The Xenobots project is mostly based out of Tufts, UVM, and Northwestern as I understand it. The wet lab, microsurgery, and hardware work is based on Boston, while the modeling, simulation, and evolution of synthetic organisms is out of Burlington and Chicago.

The Vermont Complex Systems Center does lots of other cool research into biologically inspired algorithms, alternative machine learning techniques, and the interface between computers and people / society. I&#039;m excited about all of that, not just Xenobots.  :)]]></description>
