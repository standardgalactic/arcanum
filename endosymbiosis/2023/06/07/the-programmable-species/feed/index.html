Yeah, this is a messy topic. I&#039;m also figuring out what to say about it, and this blog post is part of that process  :)

You raise a really good point about &lt;i&gt;control&lt;/i&gt;. I emphasized how these platforms are used as a tool to shape and manipulate communities. I believe that&#039;s true, but it&#039;s also a very inexact science. Advertising and propaganda can be very effective, but they can also miss and backfire. Lots of people &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; to influence online culture, and some folks have much more power to do that than others, but nobody can actually &lt;i&gt;control&lt;/i&gt; it. The web is a chaotic, collective thing, and everyone who participates helps set its direction.

On the other hand, I&#039;d argue that the human condition is all about us learning to exploit our innate social biases to build complex systems out of people. We&#039;ve gotten better at this over time, using science and engineering principles to build ever larger and more complex communities.

I find that dynamic between the collective and individuals, between evolution / culture and personal autonomy, to be fascinating and important.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been holding off responding, because I am finding I don&#039;t have anything coherent to say on this topic. I balk at claiming that anyone is really in control, or even has a full picture of what is happening on any given social network, and of course the networks are all linked as well.

Para-social relations (I hesitate to call them relationships) are very interesting in their power dynamics. You have the network owners, who set the filtering and &quot;connection&quot; algorithms, you have the influencers themselves who ostensibly create the message, you have advertisers who are paying to attach messages which are &quot;parasitic&quot; side-payloads of the influencer&#039;s message, but then you also have the &quot;super fans&quot; who are paying for more personal access to the influencers (e.g. through systems like Patreon), and have a strong impact on where the influencers direct their attention, and you have &quot;the masses&quot; whose attention is being sought and create an incentive landscape for many of the other stakeholders. It&#039;s a very messy system, and I doubt that any of the stakeholders actually have (or feel like they have) unilateral control over the message over the long term.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing your thoughts! This post is touching on ideas I haven&#039;t written about before, so some of it is still half-baked. It&#039;s helpful to get a sense of what connected for you, what didn&#039;t, and what doesn&#039;t seem right. Hopefully I&#039;ll do better in future passes  ;)

I definitely didn&#039;t mean to suggest that other animals can&#039;t learn new behaviors or learn &lt;i&gt;from each other&lt;/i&gt;. They absolutely do both of those things, and they often depend on cultural transmission, just not in the same way humans do. When I say a human needs to be &quot;programmed,&quot; that&#039;s equally true for a city dweller and a person from a small isolated tribe on the edge of the jungle. In both cases, they get &quot;programmed&quot; by their community in a way that suits the context. Saying one is &quot;more cultured&quot; than the other is just wrong; they have &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; cultures. Someone without culture would have to be removed from their community at birth. Even then, they could get by, just not much better than any other animal. So, while I exaggerated the &lt;i&gt;differences&lt;/i&gt; between humans and other animals in this post, I think we agree that they&#039;re actually much more similar than not.

I agree, the meat example is provocative, but not perfect. Our society emphasizes meat eating, but it&#039;s not a human universal. Still, it seems that our bodies have evolved in ways that rely on culture to make life easier for us, and this is a simple example of that.

I really like the idea that, like snack foods, social media is designed &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to satisfy! They want you to keep scrolling, hoping for more and better. I hadn&#039;t thought about that, but it makes a ton of sense.

What is the &quot;real purpose&quot; of social media? Zuckerberg tells general users that Facebook is about personal connection, and he tells advertisers its about advanced targeting capabilities. Both are true! However, I stopped using Facebook over a decade ago because I found their user interface to be overtly manipulative. They routinely used gamification as well as manufactured peer pressure and social guilt to push me to use their products more. That might increase my personal connection and I might even enjoy it, but it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a level playing field. The point I wanted to emphasize is how platforms distort the experience and exploit cognitive biases to funnel people into the usage patterns they want.

Although I talk about the issues of power imbalance and hegemony, what I most wanted to highlight was the interaction between evolution and culture. Our social nature is a huge part of what makes us human. I think of it as a programming interface that allows us to override our innate tendencies and invent new ways of living. It also allows for globe-spanning societies, but only by applying engineering principles: we use models and tools to understand, shape, amplify, and harness human social systems, like any other force of nature. A privileged few &quot;harnessing&quot; the minds and bodies of human beings to build a complex machine that no one controls sounds like a sci-fi dystopia, but my point is that it&#039;s not: it&#039;s how human communities work. If we think that the &quot;machine&quot; of today&#039;s society isn&#039;t the one we want, then we must understand how it&#039;s made so we can go in and fix it.

I have the same social media preferences you do.  :)  Honestly, I think social media is a crap way to keep in touch with friends and family. It&#039;s so generic and impersonal!

I quit Twitter recently for ethical reasons, and now I depend on Mastodon to get my ideas out there. I was surprised by how much I like it. It&#039;s a fun and supportive community! It may not be as good for networking and science communication, tho, we&#039;ll see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know about the comparisons you draw in this post between humans and animals.  True, if you take a human and drop them in the wild with no culture to raise them, they won&#039;t be very impressive--they&#039;ll almost certainly die.  But think how many animals this is also true of.  How many types of pets raised domestically can&#039;t be released into the wild because they don&#039;t have the knowledge they need to survive?  Maybe most invertebrates can manage.  And, like... turtles.  Some fish.  A few other kinds, I guess... but most vertebrates are going to be in trouble because, even if they aren&#039;t part of a species whose parents teach their young, they didn&#039;t learn how to live wild while their brains were still young and pliable.

And if you&#039;re talking about humans who were raised in culture, but then separated from it... well, if you put someone who grew up in a city or town or on a farm into the wild and don&#039;t let them make contact with other people, yes, they&#039;ll probably die.  But if you take someone who&#039;s grown up in or close to the wilderness, maybe someone from a tribal society or a professional nature guide, hunter or trapper... I think they&#039;d have a very good chance.  And again, if you&#039;re talking about social animals, it&#039;s largely the same.   Lots of animals are social and need each other to thrive, but can often get by alone if they had a good upbringing.  Take, say, a spotted hyena away from its clan, and it may survive or may not... same as an outdoorsy human left alone.

I&#039;ve read about a fair number of the more intelligent mammals and birds learning by watching each other, even when no active teaching is happening.  One member of the group finds a new way to get food, and soon everyone is trying it.  You could call such a living group &#039;programmable&#039; after a fashion.

Interesting point about us needing lots of calories, but being unequipped to get them in the best way (meat) without fire.  Of course, people -can- live in the wild without meat--there are dense calories in nuts, fruits, legumes, etcetera.  But living that way is hard.

Regarding social media... interestingly, my friend Roman was just reflecting in an audio diary on the idea that social media is designed to be unfulfilling so that people don&#039;t leave it too soon.  He probably has a good point.  Making things imperfect so people have to keep coming back for more (and spending more money, or exposing themselves to more ads) is nothing new.  But is it actually the purpose of social media?  I think that&#039;s a matter of perspective.  Is the purpose of basically every invention on the market to make money?  The companies making them might say so.  But cars, microwaves, pencils, skateboards and so on were all invented for a more interesting and specific purpose, from the point of view of the individuals who worked on their design and the people who buy and use them.  Social media is likewise--the more intuitive statement of its purpose is to bring people together and to keep us connected to our friends and acquaintances.  It&#039;s the same as the purpose of the postcard, the phone call, the internet forum or the e-mail.  And in theory, if we know how to know the inventions we&#039;re given, we&#039;ll use them responsibly and as a result make society better.

I think your most interesting point is that (A) some people and groups have the balance of money and power, (B) this imbalance of resources is damaging, but at least people outside that hegemony can connect with each other and keep perspective about the whole inequality thing, but (C) social media makes it possible for the people with power to sabotage this by spreading misinformation and distractions.  Really, ALL media, social or otherwise, can do that!  And yes, that can be seen as a flaw of how &quot;programmable&quot; we are.

Social media is good for updating a lot of people about your life at once.  Being an introvert, I prefer to keep more control over that, updating my friends individually.  I only use Facebook, and I don&#039;t spend much time there.  I&#039;m far more addicted to checking webcomics and turn-based game sites.  I used to use LiveJournal until I got tired of it.  But I understand you have to be on Twitter (and probably other places) to make it as a researcher, so... good luck with that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/06/07/the-programmable-species/comment-page-1/#comment-171&quot;&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the comment! To be honest, I think this post is a bit too long and pulls in too many directions. If I wasn&#039;t so busy with moving, I might have given it another rewrite, but I&#039;m trying not to be a perfectionist.

Now that I got all that out of my head, though, hopefully I&#039;ll have the chance to revisit some of those more narrow topics in more depth in the future. The last question you raise about the role of the individual is a theme that will recur in a lot of my writing. It&#039;s my way of thinking about the human condition. We&#039;re autonomous individuals, but we&#039;re embedded within two vast collective intelligent systems beyond our control: biological evolution and culture. It&#039;s scary and frustrating to feel like those systems are colliding and there&#039;s little we can do about it, but I think individuals still have a crucial role to play.

<p>Thanks for the comment! To be honest, I think this post is a bit too long and pulls in too many directions. If I wasn&#8217;t so busy with moving, I might have given it another rewrite, but I&#8217;m trying not to be a perfectionist.</p>
<p>Now that I got all that out of my head, though, hopefully I&#8217;ll have the chance to revisit some of those more narrow topics in more depth in the future.

					<description><![CDATA[There are a ton of really interesting directions suggested here, and I can’t wait to see where they take you. 

For example: The rise of the para-social relationship, (and maybe how it compares to how we would have previously associated with mythological characters), how democratized social media (like Mastodon) has potential to shift the online landscape, along with the associated “can we beat the advertising/profit pipeline” to get enough people to put in the work to actually shift the zeitgeist. Is there a useful distinction between individual problem solving and learned behavior, or is it just a large enough pool of applicable behaviors that some solitons can take on the appearance of novelty?

Just to pull a few. ^.^]]></description>
