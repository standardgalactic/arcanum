Yes, it is.  It&#039;s quite funny.  If anything is under my control, it should be myself, shouldn&#039;t it?  Yet since you wrote this, I&#039;ve kept thinking of more instances of a person being at war with themself, or at least at odds.

We negotiate with our past and future selves.  We lay boundaries for them and treat them patronizingly, as if one version is the parent and the other the naive child.   We wage war with ourselves, or ignore our future selves, or set aside dividends for them to enjoy someday

It reminds me of a character from the comic Homestuck who acquires the technology to communicate with other time periods online, and winds up frequently getting into lengthy, vitriolic arguments with his past and future selves... even those from just an hour away.  The other characters make fun of him for it.  But in our own way, it&#039;s not such an uncommon thing.

We are complex.]]></description>

I really like how this discussion is surfacing cognitive diversity.

So much of learning, productivity, and deciding what to do in life is about getting to know yourself, and a lot of misery stems from assuming you&#039;re like everyone else or that you&#039;re somehow &quot;broken&quot; if not.]]></description>

I really like your points about willpower! It reminds me that some of my vegan friends seem to be less interested in / motivated by food than average. Perhaps they&#039;re quick to make that sacrifice (for good reasons) because for them it&#039;s easier to do? I agree with you that I think willpower is real, but perhaps over-emphasized.

I like your mental trick of snapping on a promise! Isn&#039;t it funny what lengths we must go to sometimes just to control ourselves? I particularly like your observation that you stick with this behavior because, if you didn&#039;t, you would lose a valuable tool, and your personal integrity would suffer because of it. You&#039;ve constructed a story about the value and moral weight of this behavior that helps motivate you when the going gets tough. And, to keep the tool sharp, you avoid overusing or trivializing it. Cool example.  :)

What&#039;s the difference between harping on about goals and timelines vs. telling people what to do? Autonomy. I could give each person on my team a step-by-step TODO list for each day. I could also just say, &quot;we&#039;re making X, please help.&quot;  Neither of those would work out well. Instead, I give loose constraints. &quot;I need you to deliver a solution to such-and-such a problem by this date.&quot; How they solve the problem and how they divide up the work is up to them. Even more importantly, both the goal and the timeline are negotiable in a way that they wouldn&#039;t be if they were explicit tasks. For instance, if I say &quot;implement user input validation,&quot; that&#039;s a basic security practice that would be very hard to argue against. On the other hand, if I say &quot;make sure your solution is secure&quot; my team might push for a design that avoids direct user input entirely, obviating that task. Since in this case the timeline is just for tracking progress, the deadlines shift to match the design, rather than the other way around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/01/04/best-intentions/comment-page-1/#comment-113&quot;&gt;Karl Hepler&lt;/a&gt;.

These are interesting strategies and I appreciate reading about them!

Indeed, it seems like #1 would probably sabotage me rather than help; I&#039;ve never had any propensity for routines; indeed, I dislike them.  Telling myself that X is a routine would make me less likely to want to do X, not more.  But I&#039;m rather unusual that way, I think; I remember a high school teacher asking her students about their afterschool routines, and myself realizing that I didn&#039;t have one.

I suspect telling myself that I don&#039;t like a bad thing or do like a good one would pretty much just fall flat.  It might spin itself into a decent myth in my mind, though.  As we grow up and learn about nutrition, it&#039;s easier for us to acquire tastes for healthy foods like vegetables that we didn&#039;t have as children.  Some of that has got to be adults valuing variety more in general, and some may actually be based on adults having different nutritive requirements than children, but a good part of it has got to be the stories we tell ourselves about what&#039;s good for us and what&#039;s not.  So, your strategy reminds me of these stories.

Keeping a project secret!  Well, some people need to be accountable to someone to get things done.  I think I&#039;m more like you on this one, in that I do like to keep what I&#039;m working on to myself, or at least limit the people I tell about it.  In particular, I&#039;m happy to share excerpts of my writing with friends or acquaintances, but I never want to share the *last* bit I wrote in any project, since that part needs to remain my special secret--my ace in the hole, if you will.]]></description>

This makes sense!  It reminds me of how a big task requires some real high-level management.  Multiple departments and teams coordinating, meetings about meetings, schedules for drafting schedules, Gantt charts and principled planning and I don&#039;t know what else.  Whereas a smaller task can be done with a team that has regular meetings and communication channels, and a smaller one still maybe only requires a team that knows what they want and at some point someone will stop to sort the books or whatever and someone else will clean the floor and the job gets done.

On an individual level, I find it fun to jump from task to task, indulging my sometimes short attention span and making it sort of an art to do a little of this and a little of that.  The fact I&#039;m responding to this blog post over a month late is a testament to the flaws in my time management, but for low-priority tasks, it can be fun.  When I worked overnights at Target, you could say a certain whimsy in when I decided to do which task was my only pleasure in an otherwise unpleasant job.  So... being like a dumb vacuum cleaner can be fun, and so can watching one!  Intentionality has shades.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Intentions are tricky!  I was intending to respond to this post since it came out.  I&#039;m intending to do a lot of things these days, but it&#039;s easy to get sidetracked, and I&#039;ve never been more aware of when it&#039;s due to a need to relieve stress... unless it&#039;s just an addiction to short-term gratification instead?  I have to admit, it&#039;s not easy to tell those apart.

I&#039;ve seen at least a couple of articles in recent years arguing that the notion of &#039;willpower&#039; is misguided--that we should stop talking about it.  They were looking at it, I think, mainly through the lens of whether people could maintain their diet and exercise routines, and the idea was that differences in human behavior are much more due to differences in our motivations in the first place than in differences between how well we hew to our motivations.  For example, if someone is slim despite having the same metabolism, living conditions and microbiome as someone else, it&#039;s not because they have more willpower; it&#039;s probably because they like exercise and aren&#039;t so much into eating in the first place.  This may be a useful insight, but none of it convinced me that willpower isn&#039;t a thing, just that it&#039;s sometimes overemphasized.

I have a lot of promises I make to myself that are fundamentally different from intentions, in that I simply don&#039;t break my self-promises (unless maybe I&#039;ve forgotten about them).  The strongest category of these promises comprises those things that I &quot;snap on,&quot; meaning I make myself a promise and then snap my fingers to bind it.  I simply can&#039;t break a pledge I&#039;ve snapped on, and if I find I&#039;ve violated such a pledge without thinking about it, I stop immediately and give myself an extra punishment in addition, such as an extension of the pledge.  There are certain kinds of promises this works for, and certain kinds I would never snap on.  I wouldn&#039;t snap on &quot;I will do X before I sleep&quot; because that could lead to fighting sleep dangerously.  Much more common is &quot;I won&#039;t do X until I&#039;ve slept&quot; or &quot;I won&#039;t do Y until I get Z done.&quot;  Those are safe.  How can I be so secure in my knowledge that I&#039;ll never break one of these promises?  Well, it&#039;s partly habit, I think.  But a big part of it is probably a deep revulsion of the idea of losing the tool: if I ever knowingly violate a pledge I&#039;ve snapped on, then the whole concept of snapping is invalidated.  It&#039;s similar to a person giving their word of honor in a society that values such a thing.

So in other words, though intentions aren&#039;t &#039;enforced&#039; by the brain (and it would be a problem if they were), we can create moral systems for ourselves that strengthen our ability to enforce our own intentions.  We can involve other people in our moral systems too, come to think of it, whether it&#039;s an accountability buddy or a social contract or a religious community.

Writing and revisiting intentions sounds similar to making to-do lists, which I do on various levels, and also a bit like keeping a journal.  I don&#039;t quite keep a journal, but I have a bare-bones diary I have to catch up in now and then, and lately I&#039;ve been doing that by reading back through my Telegram and Discord conversations as well as reviewing my calendar.  That functions to keep things I&#039;ve been doing in my memory, which seems like a healthy part of life, and reviewing past intentions is a natural part of that revisitation.

You say, &quot;As a leader, my main responsibility is to keep intentions fresh in my teamâ€™s minds [...] rather than telling people what to do and how to do it.&quot;  What&#039;s the difference between revisiting intentions, and keeping them fresh in your team&#039;s minds, and telling them what to do?  I guess maybe it&#039;s that intentions may be more oriented about the goals to be achieved than the particular tasks that achieve them.  Creating timelines, though, suggests that you at least know what your team intends to do, even if they&#039;re following their own volition.

My New Year&#039;s resolution was just to write a paticular story in 2022.  In a masterful display of procrastination, I intended to do it over the story, and then put it off (with reasonable excuses) to after the start of the school year, then to after NaNoWriMo, then to Winter Break, and then I found myself telling myself I would write it on New Year&#039;s Eve and the night before.  Then the details of the story proved unsatisfactory and I realized I would need more rewrites, and I wasn&#039;t able to do it.  Well, New Year&#039;s resolutions have a reputation for being unmanagable.  I haven&#039;t found the trick of intentions on that scale yet myself.  (I mean, yes, setting a subgoal for each month might work, but... well, that seems silly for such a small goal.  Yet I might give it a try.)]]></description>

I wouldn&#8217;t snap on &#8220;I will do X before I sleep&#8221; because that could lead to fighting sleep dangerously.  Much more common is &#8220;I won&#8217;t do X until I&#8217;ve slept&#8221; or &#8220;I won&#8217;t do Y until I get Z done.&#8221;  Those are safe.  How can I be so secure in my knowledge that I&#8217;ll never break one of these promises?  Well, it&#8217;s partly habit, I think.  But a big part of it is probably a deep revulsion of the idea of losing the tool: if I ever knowingly violate a pledge I&#8217;ve snapped on, then the whole concept of snapping is invalidated.  It&#8217;s similar to a person giving their word of honor in a society that values such a thing.</p>
<p>So in other words, though intentions aren&#8217;t &#8216;enforced&#8217; by the brain (and it would be a problem if they were), we can create moral systems for ourselves that strengthen our ability to enforce our own intentions.  We can involve other people in our moral systems too, come to think of it, whether it&#8217;s an accountability buddy or a social contract or a religious community.</p>
<p>Writing and revisiting intentions sounds similar to making to-do lists, which I do on various levels, and also a bit like keeping a journal.  I don&#8217;t quite keep a journal, but I have a bare-bones diary I have to catch up in now and then, and lately I&#8217;ve been doing that by reading back through my Telegram and Discord conversations as well as reviewing my calendar.  That functions to keep things I&#8217;ve been doing in my memory, which seems like a healthy part of life, and reviewing past intentions is a natural part of that revisitation.</p>
<p>You say, &#8220;As a leader, my main responsibility is to keep intentions fresh in my teamâ€™s minds [&#8230;] rather than telling people what to do and how to do it.&#8221;  What&#8217;s the difference between revisiting intentions, and keeping them fresh in your team&#8217;s minds, and telling them what to do?  I guess maybe it&#8217;s that intentions may be more oriented about the goals to be achieved than the particular tasks that achieve them.  Creating timelines, though, suggests that you at least know what your team intends to do, even if they&#8217;re following their own volition.</p>
<p>My New Year&#8217;s resolution was just to write a paticular story in 2022.  In a masterful display of procrastination, I intended to do it over the story, and then put it off (with reasonable excuses) to after the start of the school year, then to after NaNoWriMo, then to Winter Break, and then I found myself telling myself I would write it on New Year&#8217;s Eve and the night before.  Then the details of the story proved unsatisfactory and I realized I would need more rewrites, and I wasn&#8217;t able to do it.  Well, New Year&#8217;s resolutions have a reputation for being unmanagable.  I haven&#8217;t found the trick of intentions on that scale yet myself.  (I mean, yes, setting a subgoal for each month might work, but&#8230; well, that seems silly for such a small goal.  Yet I might give it a try.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/01/04/best-intentions/comment-page-1/#comment-113&quot;&gt;Karl Hepler&lt;/a&gt;.

Those are some great examples, Karl! Good practical advice, but also really interesting to think about cognitively.  :)

One thing I&#039;ll say is, you seem to be unusually good at asserting your will over your own experience of reality. It&#039;s super useful to be able to tell yourself &quot;this is how it is,&quot; but, as you say, it doesn&#039;t work for everybody. At least, not as well. I do find some people just &lt;i&gt;assume&lt;/i&gt; tricks like this won&#039;t work for them without giving it a solid try, but I also believe some people just need to find other strategies...

I do #1 a lot, though I don&#039;t necessarily say &quot;it&#039;s always been like this.&quot; For me, the important thing is to specifically try to create a habit. Deciding to go to the gym today is important, but sometimes hard. If I had to do that every day, then I&#039;d make an excuse one day, and that might be the beginning of the end. The trick is not to &quot;decide.&quot; I just do it, every time, because that&#039;s the routine. Maybe I&#039;ll miss going to the gym some day, but that&#039;s not because I decided to give myself a break. No, something messed with my routine, and tomorrow things will go back to normal! If I can put myself in that mindset, it&#039;s much easier to make changes.

I can also relate to #2. Instead of ice cream, my example is alcohol. I picked up the bad habit of binge drinking in college. As I grew older, the negative effects began to outweigh the positive ones, but it was really hard to break the habit. I found what worked for me was to change my mental associations. Whenever the idea of drinking comes up, I try to remember the visceral feeling of discomfort I get from drinking too much. I imagine that acid queasiness in my stomach, the clouded mind, the headache, the struggling to sleep. I try to really feel it in my body, and that immediately makes the alcohol less appealing. By doing this every time, it becomes automatic and I don&#039;t have to think about it any more. It&#039;s a powerful deterrent!

#3 is different for me, but I find your example really interesting. The motivation for sticking with a hard task comes from dopamine, which is also associated with drug addiction. The dopamine system rewards a job well done with a feeling of satisfaction, but it also &lt;i&gt;anticipates&lt;/i&gt; that feeling of satisfaction and gives you little dribbles of dopamine to keep you moving towards that finish line. It&#039;s the physical manifestation of motivation. When you lose interest, the idea doesn&#039;t produce any dopamine any more. Your brain stops rewarding you for doing the hard thing, so you don&#039;t bother.

Dopamine is a really tricky thing to work with, though. Dopamine levels can change suddenly and dramatically in response to all sorts of things, which differ from person to person. Karl, perhaps a big motivation for you with these side projects is to show people you&#039;re creative and working on cool ideas. As long as that goal is still ahead of you, your body will supply the dopamine to keep you plodding forward. But if you &quot;cheat&quot; and give yourself release early by sharing the half-baked idea before it&#039;s done, then suddenly there&#039;s not enough anticipation to keep you going.

It&#039;s really powerful to understand these unconscious, internal dynamics that drive you. Learning to use them is like tricking your mind and body into doing what you want. Acting intentionally is hard, so I&#039;m glad for every trick I can get!]]></description>

That&#039;s a really interesting example. Thanks for sharing!

You remind me of Daniel Dennett&#039;s idea of &quot;competence without comprehension,&quot; which is a useful tool for thinking about intelligence. It&#039;s totally possible to do something smart without any awareness or intentionality. The &quot;dumb&quot; robot vacuum is a great example of this. It just follows some dead simple rules, bumbling around randomly, because that&#039;s all it needs to do to clean the room effectively.

So why do we have intentionality at all? I suspect it&#039;s about open-endedness, which you hint at in your comment. In small rooms without too much complex shape, both vacuums do equally well. Maybe the smart vacuum is more efficient, but it very are few opportunities for its cleverness to matter. If you had lots of obstacles, or hard-to-reach areas, or constraints on when and where the vacuum should run, well... then you&#039;d need the smart vacuum. To reliably achieve those more complex goals, it would need to do some amount of planning, which would also mean a degree of self-awareness.

Human beings tend to have big intentions in a chaotic environment, so being intentional and making plans is more important. If we just go around &quot;reacting&quot; like the dumb vacuum, we&#039;ll make similar kinds of mistakesâ€”we&#039;ll miss some opportunities, do redundant work, get tangled up in obstacles, etc. Of course, that&#039;s not a perfect analogy, because a person reacting in the moment can be fully aware of their situation and respond very cleverly. That&#039;s one of the reasons why we can get away with &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; good intentions much of the time. Our ability to quickly judge a situation and improvise in real time is something no robot even comes close to yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have another thought about this post that might be more on topic. There are a couple of tricks that always seem to work for me when intending to start something new and sticking to it. However, they likely aren&#039;t for everyone. Through conversations with friends and associates, I have found that most believe these strategies would produce the opposite effect for them. I wonder what you think of them.



1. I am not starting something new. I have always done this. This is the way things are and the way they have always been.

I started a simple at-home exercise routine when the pandemic started. I was doing a few familiar things late at night. I was accustomed to staying up late. I&#039;ve been staying up until 2am or later since adolescence. It was a part of who I was, how I thought, how I operated. It was a part of my creative process and my unshakeable habit that helped make me who I was up to that point.

As the months went on, I didn&#039;t change my workout routine much and I wasn&#039;t particularly consistent. I didn&#039;t really care that much about it. It was just a way for me to feel better in the isolation of the early days of the pandemic. I recognized that it greatly helped my personal wellbeing, which is why I kept it up.

At some point, I stopped. Things were getting busy at work and I had other personal projects I was working on - other things to keep me occupied in the late evenings. I stopped working out for months, but I kind of wanted to get back into it.

So, almost to my own surprise, I decided to start waking up early. In the course of one week, I started waking up earlier in the morning each day until I reached my goal of waking up at 5:30am. On Monday morning when I awoke at 8am, I told myself that I had always done that and today was no different. On Tuesday, when I awoke at 7:30am, I told myself the same. As the days went on, I continued to tell myself that I this morning is no different than all of the other mornings of my life. I have always awoken early.

I actually believed myself. I guess I can be pretty convincing - especially to myself.

One morning, without having thought of it or planned for it prior, I decided to go into the gym. When I got in there, I told myself that this was my normal routine. I always went to the gym early in the morning, and today was no different.

For my loved ones, this was shocking change in my routine. They said things like &quot;you only just started waking up early&quot; or &quot;you just started to go to the gym&quot;. No, I would reply, this is the way things are.

I didn&#039;t consciously plan ahead, but I knew that I had to change my behavior. Instead of working through the trials and tribulations of making a change, I skipped past it. I didn&#039;t have to change, because I had always been this way... at least that&#039;s what I told myself.



2. I like this. I don&#039;t like that.

I find it easy to tell myself that I like or don&#039;t like things. It&#039;s weird how powerful that is.

When I was younger, I loved ice cream. I would buy ice cream weekly, if not more. I had a habit of eating ice cream after dinner, or sometimes as a late-night snack. Ice cream is not great for my health and I knew that I should stop. So I just told myself that I don&#039;t like it... and it worked.

To this day, I rarely have ice cream... maybe once a year at most. I just don&#039;t like it (so I say, and so I believe).



3. Keep it a secret, or reveal few details. Don&#039;t talk about it much.

I always seem to have at least one personal programming (or other) project going at a time, but I find that I can never finish them. I&#039;ve tried planning, no planning, and everything in between. For some reason, I always lose interest or run out of steam.

More recently, I had a project that I actually completed... well... that is to say I got a functional MVP working to my liking. Once that was done, it too lost steam. However, before that happened, things were going great. I had actually been consistently working on it for months, which was by far better than any project of similar scope up to that point.

Why had I gotten so far into this project and fallen from the others so much sooner? What was different about this situation? All things being similar to previous projects, there was one major difference: I didn&#039;t tell anyone about it. I kept it a secret. I never talked about it.

Interestingly enough, once I had completed the MVP, I started to tell people about it... and once again, the project slid into limbo with the rest.

I feel like, at least for me, when I tell others about my intent, the telling grants me a sense of accomplishment. It frames it so well in my mind that I feel like I&#039;ve already completed it, as if the implementation details are so easy to solve that they&#039;re not worth doing... so I don&#039;t do them... and so I don&#039;t complete the project.

I&#039;ve found that if I want to complete something of significant scope, it&#039;s best for me to wait until it&#039;s complete before sharing. If I share too soon, I give myself a sense of accomplishment and completion prematurely, which prevents me from doing the real work to actually complete it.]]></description>
