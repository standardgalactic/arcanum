I guess you&#039;re saying that there was a time with DNA, or its chemical ancestor, was once part of &quot;the cell,&quot; or its biological ancestor, and not a separate thing conduction business from within.  Well, no floppy disk could *really* invent an operating system.  But it can be put in a position to load and maintain it.

The idea of RNA-like molecules (with ribose still involved somehow, I guess?) that are simpler but might have eventually developed into four-symbol RNA, safe in their little carbon shelters, is rather appealing.  I looked at the paper you linked, but found it over my head--it seems to be concerned with semiotic interpretations of biological mechanisms more than with their origin, so it left me puzzled.]]></description>

You&#039;re right about the messiness around this question. It also gets bound up into what we mean by words like &quot;life&quot; and &quot;cell.&quot;  :-P

Personally, I&#039;m really enamored with the story of abiogenesis that Terry Deacon tells in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379971&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Incomplete Nature&lt;/a&gt; (and in shorter form in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12304-021-09453-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;). That starts with far simpler molecules than RNA, barely sheltered from the world in a carbon nanotube or something similar. But that&#039;s certainly not a cell yet, and by some definitions it&#039;s not even alive, but I agree with Deacon that something like that was probably a necessary first step.

I suspect an &quot;RNA world&quot; scenario might have existed as an intermediary step, but I find it hard to believe the first life was RNA-based. Either way, when RNA first appeared its meaning and purpose would have been &lt;i&gt;very different&lt;/i&gt; from what it is today. In other words: same molecule, different concept. Rather than representing a generic control program or the messages used to read that program, they would have been &quot;part of the machine&quot; in a much more literal and direct sense, their shape mattering more than their information content. I mostly say this because the mechanism of using DNA to encode a lifestyle and power a universal protein synthesis engine is... rather complicated. It must have taken many, many steps to get to that point.]]></description>

&quot;DNA didnâ€™t invent the cell. Itâ€™s the other way around. The cell invented DNA...&quot;

This makes me think of the famous question of which came first, the chicken or the egg.

In the grand scheme, when we consider &quot;the&quot; generic cell and &quot;DNA,&quot; in the abstract... well, I think it&#039;s theorized that RNA molecules came first, and then cells formed around them?  And then they advanced into being DNA?  But I&#039;m not sure and maybe no one is.  And it&#039;s complicated by cells capturing mitochrondria and chloroplasts with their own DNA, but I guess that comes later in the story.

In the more specific case of chromosomes and cells in a particular organism... DNA makes proteins that control cell division and differentiation, doesn&#039;t it?  And cells allow DNA to function.  Well, I guess I&#039;m curious about the rationale behind this statement, since it seems like an unclear question to me.]]></description>

I&#039;d say the floppy disk &lt;i&gt;didn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; invent its own operating system. Or, to strip away the metaphor, DNA &lt;i&gt;didn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; invent the cell. It&#039;s the other way around. The cell invented DNA, just as an operating system was used to write the program on the floppy disk.

Exactly what gets passed on from mother to child aside from DNA is a very difficult question to answer, and an active area of research! This is what epigenetics is all about.

When I say organisms are opinionated, I include innate behaviors just because they have evolved to act this way and not that way. A fungus just releases its spores to the wind. That seems pretty careless, and it probably didn&#039;t mentally &quot;choose&quot; to do that. But evolution &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; choose that strategy out of many others, and the fungus reliably follows that strategy instead of, say, raising a family in the style of American suburbia. It has a way of doing things, and it sticks to it. Again, maybe we need better words to talk about the same phenomena with varying degrees of intentionality.  :-P]]></description>

I was following your operating system/floppy disk analogy, but thinking that the key difference is that this floppy disk has built its own operating system!  But of course, it has to start somewhere, like a boot disk does... and you point out:

&quot;The cell isnâ€™t made from the DNA itself, not all of its structure is represented in the DNA.&quot;

I guess if cells all come from other cells, it stands to reason even a single ovum will pass along structures the DNA doesn&#039;t build.  And this idea is vaguely familiar.  But now I wonder what cell structures are passed along in this way.  For example, I googled &quot;where are ribosomes synthesized&quot; and was told it was in the nucleolus, a part of the nucleus I vaguely remembered existed but... well, the process seems complicated.  Dear me, there&#039;s so much I&#039;ve forgotten about biology.

&quot;I think that if you accept that all life forms have opinions about their reproduction, then the collective process of evolution must also be opinionated,&quot; you say.  Well, it&#039;s not hard to accept the idea that a dog in heat has opinions about her potential partners, but do organisms that just spawn their seed into the water to be randomly matched up with those of the opposite sex really have opinions about their reproduction?  Do brainless organisms have opinions?  I wonder if you meant something more abstract when you talked about the opinionated nature of life.]]></description>

Good point about the word &quot;inert.&quot; It has a few meanings, and a chemist might disagree that DNA is inert.

The term &quot;epigenetics&quot; is also a little ambiguous. Originally it meant &quot;the processes built on top of genetics,&quot; which is how it got the name. These days, it often means any non-genetic mechanisms for passing information across generations. My point is that the cell itself is a robot (ie, an embodied program) that has its own behaviors and information separate from the DNA molecule. It acts a bit like an operating system on an old computer where you have to insert a floppy disk for the program you want to run. The operating system doesn&#039;t do much on its own, but it provides the platform for running any appropriately formatted program disk. Similarly, the disk holds most of the information describing what the computer will do, but it&#039;s meaningless and does nothing until you insert it into an appropriate computer. Of course, the biggest problem with this analogy is that in living organisms the boundaries are very fuzzy and complicated (you cite some excellent examples of this). Perhaps the biggest complication is the cell is made of pieces described in the DNA. The cell isn&#039;t made from the DNA itself, not all of its structure is represented in the DNA, but it is partly determined by the DNA and would quickly fall apart without it. So, there&#039;s even more co-dependence between these two levels of programming than you see in a digital computer.

Regarding stress-related mutations, your interpretation is totally valid. It&#039;s unclear which of these is the &quot;real&quot; reason, or if it&#039;s a mix of both.

Does the opinion of an organism make evolution opinionated? Great question. I think that if you accept that all life forms have opinions about their reproduction, then the collective process of evolution must also be opinionated. Evolution is just the emergent product of a bunch of reproducing agents, and is determined by the agents&#039; behavior.

Love your point about Darwinian evolution. Well said  :)

Perhaps we need better words to distinguish forms of &quot;design&quot; that are or are not intentional. I haven&#039;t heard of &quot;designoid.&quot;  :)

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this essay series outlining lots of important concepts in how life directs its own evolution!  Let&#039;s see what my thoughts are for this final part.

You say that DNA is an inert molecule, which I don&#039;t think is technically true.  I think I take your meaning, in that it needs lots of other molecules of various kinds to operate and doesn&#039;t chug stuff out on its own.  In a chemical sense, though, most molecules are reactive rather than inert, and DNA is particularly reactive, since there are so many things that can interact with it and trigger reactions!

&quot;Every living thing is made up of two evolved programs: the DNA and the cell.&quot;  I don&#039;t understand quite what mechanism you&#039;re talking about here.  Some organisms reproduce asexually through mitosis, so stuff in the cell can endure from one generation to the next.  Others reproduce when pieces break off, which allows stuff in their cells to also be part of what&#039;s passed along.  We sexually reproducing creatures use a sperm fertilizing an egg, but as far as I know, the sperm just contributes genetic material to that, meaning that the room for epigenetic cellular contents to be passed along is limited to a single ovum.  Is this the epigenetic concept you&#039;re talking about--non-nucleic contents from the mother&#039;s fertilized egg cell?  When I think of epigenetics, I think about babies in a womb getting exposed to hormones in the mother&#039;s body, which is a bit different from &quot;the cell as a program.&quot;  But I don&#039;t know what the main channel for transmission really is.

Or, are you pointing out that DNA affects the contents of a living cell, which in turn affects the DNA, and back and forth?  If that&#039;s what you&#039;re talking about, I would be inclined to call it all one program rather than two, and to say it&#039;s all programmed by the DNA, with the cell as its toolkit or canvas or computer, pick your metaphor.

It&#039;s true, thinking about something as basic as genetic error correction raises questions about how exactly the perfect error correction rate evolves.  Does it operate based on mutations in the DNA of sex cells, specifically?  Mutations elsewhere might be useful occasionally, but I would think any amount of proneness to mutation outside of sex cells would generally make an organism less likely to survive.  But mutations in sex cells might result in an unusually successful child, thus propagating some genes, including perhaps the ones that cause slightly lower error correction.  And a much lower correction rate would obviously be bad for fitness.  So, I guess the level of error correction could be caused by evolution on the level of individuals and their parents, not on the level of communities.

What about this more sophisticated idea that error correction is more common in certain parts of the DNA?  I suppose the same logic applies to it--some types of mutation are more likely to result in unusually successful offspring.

&quot;Perhaps most remarkable is that when cells get stressed out, they divert energy to other things, and away from error correction.&quot;  Interesting... I guess, just based on this information, I&#039;d be more likely to just say that error correction is a relatively low priority when times are tough, and say it&#039;s not so much that the cell is taking desperate measures for desperate times, but just that it&#039;s using its energy on high-priority tasks.  As an analogy, if you need to ride a bicycle through a desert, you might leave behind some repair tools in exchange for another water bottle or two.

I had heard of apoptosis, but I hadn&#039;t thought of it as a way to clear out errors.  This is interesting to read about.  Google says that &quot;Apoptosis involves a series of steps. Most notably, the cell shrinks, blebs form, chromatin condenses, the cytoskeleton collapses, the nuclear envelope disintegrates, apoptotic bodies form, and the cell is phagocytosed (swallowed or cleared away by another cell).&quot;  That&#039;s a dramatic process of destruction!  Also, hee &quot;blebs.&quot;

I guess I&#039;ll read about methylation, since I don&#039;t know anything about it.  I&#039;ve heard of organisms passing along adaptations to e.g. a dry climate to future generations, but I&#039;d like to know how that works.  It&#039;s tempting to read Evolution in Four Dimensions, but I have enough books queued up to read already!

Hmmm, do a dog&#039;s opinions on whom to mate with make the evolutionary algorithm opinionated?  Maybe in a technical sense.  Some living things include an exoskeleton and some have venom, so is it fair to say that &quot;Life is exoskeletal and venomous&quot;?  Intelligence and the opinions that come with it are part of the process... sometimes.

&quot;Darwin is the beginning of the story of evolution, not the end.&quot;  That seems fair.  I might be inclined to say that Darwinian evolution is the most basic level at which evolution operates, on top of which numerous more sophisticated systems have developed.

&quot;Itâ€™s better to say that life designed itself than to say it evolved by chance,&quot; you say in bold.  Hmm, what do I think of that?  My attitude is similar to how it&#039;s been in response to your past posts: I&#039;m inclined to say that certain terms, like &quot;design,&quot; do in fact imply intentionality, which means it&#039;s not, in my opinion, technically right to say that life designed itself.  I remember Dawkins suggesting that evolved things are not designed, but &quot;designoid&quot;--did that word ever catch on anywhere?  It seems like a fair statement if we interpret it loosely, though.  Better than saying life evolved by chance, I suppose... chance was a big part of the process, but hardly the most interesting part.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for this essay series outlining lots of important concepts in how life directs its own evolution!  Let&#8217;s see what my thoughts are for this final part.</p>
<p>You say that DNA is an inert molecule, which I don&#8217;t think is technically true.  I think I take your meaning, in that it needs lots of other molecules of various kinds to operate and doesn&#8217;t chug stuff out on its own.  In a chemical sense, though, most molecules are reactive rather than inert, and DNA is particularly reactive, since there are so many things that can interact with it and trigger reactions!</p>
<p>&#8220;Every living thing is made up of two evolved programs: the DNA and the cell.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t understand quite what mechanism you&#8217;re talking about here.  Some organisms reproduce asexually through mitosis, so stuff in the cell can endure from one generation to the next.  Others reproduce when pieces break off, which allows stuff in their cells to also be part of what&#8217;s passed along.  We sexually reproducing creatures use a sperm fertilizing an egg, but as far as I know, the sperm just contributes genetic material to that, meaning that the room for epigenetic cellular contents to be passed along is limited to a single ovum.

Completely agreed.  :)

Here&#039;s a fun thing to ponder: if we do find other life in our solar system, how similar will it be to us? For me, the big question is whether it uses DNA or not. In my mind, DNA is a pretty arbitrary way to store data, so I would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; expect alien life to use it &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; it was related to us. If it was, I&#039;d be terribly excited, because it would mean life could be &lt;i&gt;vastly&lt;/i&gt; older than we thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really hoping we find some clear evidence of life elsewhere in the solar system, or in &quot;nearby&quot; systems.
