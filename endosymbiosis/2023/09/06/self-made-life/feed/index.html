Completely agreed! I love how Mike&#039;s work views life as a fractal adaptive system, where each part is learning and striving to help the organism succeed. It&#039;s the higher levels where this intelligence becomes incredibly powerful, but my hope is that looking at the very bottom (the genetic mechanisms of a single cell) will give insight into how all the layers build on top of each other.

When I think about this sort of thing, I always come back to the visual metaphor of a fractal vice: https://youtu.be/Tvnizh0XPOA]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that it&#039;s so much more complex than just random mutation and selection, due to the complexity of the genotype-&#062;phenotype mapping. I love the idea of life shaping its own evolution. So I&#039;ll be interested to see what examples you have for the next post.

Ignoring that meta-level for now, I even feel like there&#039;s lots of ways that the _individual_ biological machine sets itself up to be more likely to succeed than to fail in a mutation. I think of experiments from Mike Levin&#039;s lab where they perturb the features of a tadpole&#039;s face but they still manage to correct the positioning and develop into a correctly-shaped frog face. It seems like there are abundant error-correcting procedures like this, and I think that makes for a substrate that is more &quot;evolvable&quot;, more amenable to random mutation, because each level just needs to get the instructions in the right ballpark and the lower level will take care of the details on its own. Hence why I love his concept of building things with &quot;agential materials&quot; rather than plain old dumb lego bricks.]]></description>

The notion of reproductive fate in a collective is... complicated. I must admit, I&#039;m pretty ignorant when it comes to population genetics.

When I said &quot;genetic cell&quot; I meant any cell built with the DNA-centric computational architecture we see in all known life. I could have just said &quot;cell,&quot; but I wanted to emphasize what kind of adaptive system it is. Not just a &quot;building block of life,&quot; but a particular kind of problem solving machine. Perhaps that was confusing?

The game metaphor is something I just thought up when I read your comment. I think it has promise, but its just a metaphor and I&#039;m not sure yet whether it&#039;s a useful one. It&#039;s unclear how it relates to actual cell biology, but perhaps that&#039;s something I will explore in my research. We&#039;ll see  :)

‚ÄúDesign by preserved accident‚Äù definitely applies to cultural evolution, too! Your comment reminds me that Be Smart recently did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/thtKslF8zE4?feature=shared&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;fun video&lt;/a&gt; about how the scientific process is all about happy accidents, unexpected connections, and mashing together things that worked in other contexts.]]></description>

It makes sense at first blush that reproductive fate is generally bound to an organism, not its cells, nor its community.  But, how do we know that&#039;s true?  We can certainly talk about the health of a community or a population.  Species and genera die out when conditions change, or have their ranges reduced, while others thrive.  We can observe that the Shakers died out because they didn&#039;t reproduce, which would be an example of the poor reproductive fate of a religious denomination.  Do we associate natural selection primarily with individuals within a population because that&#039;s just the chief Darwinian narrative?

The $64,000 question is: If life is molding the game of genetics to make it easier for a genetic cell to play, what&#039;s an example of how it does it?  What is a genetic cell, for that matter?  Any cell with a nucleus, i.e. a non-blood cell?

&quot;Design by preserved accident&quot; reminds me of various stories about some scientist (often a chemist) who was trying to do something and messed up (perhaps leaving a chemical out and exposed for too long), and the result was a new discovery even better than the original research was aiming for.  It must be important for a scientific establishment to be able to pivot and nurture such discoveries!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/09/06/self-made-life/comment-page-1/#comment-206&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

Very interesting thoughts as always, Thorin. Thanks for sharing!

This comment reminds me a lot of one of my favorite books on this topic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379971&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Incomplete Nature&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, I think that&#039;s where I get the idea of describing evolved traits as &quot;purposeful,&quot; though Dan Dennett talks about that a lot, too, in the form of &quot;free-floating rationales.&quot; In either case, the idea is that life has good reasons to do what it does, it just doesn&#039;t necessarily know what those reasons are! They are just &quot;what worked&quot; in the context of natural selection. But they still serve a purpose (keeping the organism alive) and life &lt;i&gt;chooses&lt;/i&gt; to do them (in the sense that an organism&#039;s biology evolved to be one way and not another). We&#039;re just used to doing these things in our minds, so we aren&#039;t used to seeing them in a non-cognitive context, and feel uncomfortable describing both with the same word. Personally, I like using the same word, just to force us to think about what these different processes have in common, which is a lot.

The other interesting point you touch on is looking at life from multiple levels of description. Human minds like to think about &quot;individuals&quot; but that word can apply to cells, organisms, communities of a single species, whole ecosystems, or even all of life itself. Each of these things is a complex system with many parts bound together by their mutual relationship to each other, with collective behaviors that are very much more than the sum of their parts. I think the biggest difference between these is that reproductive fate is generally bound to an organism, not its cells, nor its community. That makes it difficult to talk about &quot;selection&quot; at those other levels of description. But I think that&#039;s okay. The way we talk about selection &lt;i&gt;should be&lt;/i&gt; different at the population level, because that&#039;s a different kind of adaptive system. What we&#039;re really talking about isn&#039;t whether this population is better than that population, but rather what selective forces &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; the population shape its collective behavior, and how does that feed back to individual reproductive success. I admit, this explanation is a little half baked, but it&#039;s something I&#039;d like to develop more in the future.

One way of describing evolution that I love is &quot;design by preserved accident.&quot; So, your last question gets at something pretty fundamental, I think! The simple answer is that successful organisms have more kids, but this whole post is about why I think it&#039;s more complicated than that. Arimaa is a &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; point of comparison. That game was designed to be a variation of chess that&#039;s harder for a computer to solve than regular chess. One of the big ideas that I&#039;m arguing for here is that life acts a bit like a game designer. Every single lifetime is like an instance of the game, where an organism does its best to &quot;win,&quot; figuring out what to do in real time, but always within the constraints of the &quot;rules&quot; embedded in its biology. But over long stretches of time, life also experiments with the rules themselves. Arimaa is a game designed to be &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; for a certain kind of adaptive system to play, forcing programmers to find a different kind of adaptive system to beat human players. Life tries to design a game (many games, actually; at least one for each species) that is &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; for a certain kind of adaptive system (a genetic cell) to play, so that the same core functionality can be shared across many different lifestyles. So, it&#039;s doing &lt;i&gt;the opposite&lt;/i&gt; of what the Arimaa designer did.]]></description>

That&#039;s a great observation, Mike! I agree that what we call &quot;foresight&quot; is often more like &quot;hindsight.&quot; We remember the ways something can go wrong and then we don&#039;t do it like that... which is also what evolution does.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, cells as programmers!  What do I think?  Well, I think this analogy is fair.  I guess the main meat of it is in how &quot;life&quot; gives its own cells guidance on how to change and improve their programs.  And that&#039;ll be covered in Part 3!  So, what other smaller thoughts do I have for this part?

It&#039;s interesting to think of life as having the purpose of figuring out how the universe can be thrived in.  Strictly, I think purpose is a thing that implies a choice being made, in that for a thing to have a purpose, someone needed to make the thing with that purpose in mind.  (The purpose of a hammer is to hammer nails.)  For an idea to have a purpose, someone needed to conceive of the idea with that purpose in mind.  (The purpose of voting is to give the people a say in their own leadership.)  So, when someone talks about the &quot;purpose of life&quot; or the purpose of some particular evolutionary adaptation, they&#039;re speaking loosely.  I guess the assumption is that when we talk about the purpose of an adaptation, we&#039;re saying &quot;If this organism (or its designer) was specifically trying to help this organism be more fit, what was the purpose of including this adaptation?&quot;  So, our go-to &quot;purpose&quot; for living things is indeed (usually) that first one--living and reproducing.  But occasionally, people talk about the purpose of something on a broader scale, like an ecology.  They might say, the purpose of plankton is so the little fish and crustaceans have something to eat.  Or even, the purpose of plankton is to transfer energy from the sun into animals, which can&#039;t absorb its energy (in a usable way) directly.  So, sometimes we do imply a higher-level purpose when it comes to living things.

We can see the whole multifarious story of life as a big project to figure out what works, biologically speaking, and what doesn&#039;t.  Oh, most of the universe is a vacuum but there are some atmospheres around some planets, and some oceans?  That&#039;s where life will work, check it out!  Let&#039;s try living things that have their liquid innards open to the world.  Oops, it all spilled out!  Okay, let&#039;s try a version with a sealed membrane.  Much better!  We&#039;re getting somewhere.  Now let&#039;s try a system where there&#039;s a strict chain of energy transfer with no way to get the fuel back to the top.  Oops, it just bottomed out and the creatures all died!  Now let&#039;s try a version where the energy loops around.  Much better!  And so on.

Viewed in this way, it does make sense to suggest that the evolutionary process of cells might be contributing to that broader, higher purpose as well as to the still exciting but &quot;lower&quot; purpose of keeping organisms alive.  Why would things move in that direction, though?  It seems like it would have to be what I mentioned in response to the last post--some kind of communal evolution, where it&#039;s not about this organism versus that organism surviving, but this colony versus that colony, or this species versus that species, or this ecology versus that ecology.  At the start of life, maybe even this biosphere versus that biosphere.  High-level stuff!  Where it&#039;s harder to tell a compelling story about how the evolution happens and maybe harder to make the math work.

So, cells program by wading right into failure.  How do they manage to keep their occasional successes, though?  We were talking about Arimaa the other day and how it&#039;s a game designed to make brute force searches really inefficient.  Is the genetic code more like chess or checkers or Arimaa in that sense?  If cells are being smarter than what brute trial and error would yield, how do those methods for being smarter work, and how did they develop?]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, cells as programmers!  What do I think?  Well, I think this analogy is fair.  I guess the main meat of it is in how &#8220;life&#8221; gives its own cells guidance on how to change and improve their programs.  And that&#8217;ll be covered in Part 3!  So, what other smaller thoughts do I have for this part?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to think of life as having the purpose of figuring out how the universe can be thrived in.  Strictly, I think purpose is a thing that implies a choice being made, in that for a thing to have a purpose, someone needed to make the thing with that purpose in mind.  (The purpose of a hammer is to hammer nails.)  For an idea to have a purpose, someone needed to conceive of the idea with that purpose in mind.  (The purpose of voting is to give the people a say in their own leadership.)  So, when someone talks about the &#8220;purpose of life&#8221; or the purpose of some particular evolutionary adaptation, they&#8217;re speaking loosely.  I guess the assumption is that when we talk about the purpose of an adaptation, we&#8217;re saying &#8220;If this organism (or its designer) was specifically trying to help this organism be more fit, what was the purpose of including this adaptation?&#8221;  So, our go-to &#8220;purpose&#8221; for living things is indeed (usually) that first one&#8211;living and reproducing.  But occasionally, people talk about the purpose of something on a broader scale, like an ecology.  They might say, the purpose of plankton is so the little fish and crustaceans have something to eat.  Or even, the purpose of plankton is to transfer energy from the sun into animals, which can&#8217;t absorb its energy (in a usable way) directly.  So, sometimes we do imply a higher-level purpose when it comes to living things.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What would this discussion looking like if we denied that humans have foresight? From a certain perspective, say an observer for whom anything less than 10 years is at the limit of how small an observable increment could be, there isn&#039;t that much evidence of foresight really.
