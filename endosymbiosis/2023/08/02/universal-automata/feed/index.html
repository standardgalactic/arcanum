Good addition, Neil. I particularly like the math function metaphor, that seems helpful!

I find that speculation about whether LLMs &quot;understand&quot; to be interesting, but often misguided. Like, I think the real question is &quot;what do we mean by understanding&quot;? Clearly LLMs do &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; cool, and it&#039;s probably like something that happens in the human mind, but it&#039;s definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; full human understanding in the traditional sense. We need better, more specific words to describe these faculties, so we can talk about them clearly without over- or under-selling what AI is capable of.]]></description>

I can endorse this answer. :-)

And I also feel that I should add that there still is a lot of debate among experts about to what extent these models actually &quot;understand&quot; what they&#039;re saying. Many point out that to answer as well as they do they must approximate some model of the world inside their functions. Which would make it something more than just statistics of word frequencies.

Either way, it&#039;s still true that ChatGPT is not a functioning system like we are; but rather a single, gigantic mathematical function, not fundamentally different from &quot;5xy + 3z + 9&quot;, except in scale. You just put in a single input, and it returns a single output. It has no memory, no experiences, and does not change over time (until it is replaced by a different function, like a software update). In a way, it has &quot;knowledge&quot;, in the form of the 5, 3, and 9 above (statistics of how the inputs relate to each other).  But it&#039;s rather anthropomorphic to say that it sifts and chooses within a compendium of information.

There are, of course, people who are trying to give it memory and the ability to take autonomous action, but that&#039;s a whole other story and hasn&#039;t changed much with recent technology. I do wish more authors would simply describe it as a math function, since that&#039;s what it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/universal-automata/comment-page-1/#comment-200&quot;&gt;Renee Ritter&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven&#039;t read that book, but I would expect it to be pretty speculative. Only one of the authors (Dan Huttenlocher) is actually a computer scientist, and most of his past work seems to be on computer vision and social networks. Eric Schmidt is pretty technical, but mostly he&#039;s a businessman, and Henry Kissinger&#039;s specialty is politics. So, I imagine this book is by folks who understand the technology (but not very deeply), speculating on how it will impact society, and... well, nobody has a crystal ball.

I think your summary of AI is not bad, though I&#039;d push back against the phrase &quot;sift and choose.&quot; The current generation of AI doesn&#039;t &quot;think,&quot; it just recognizes patterns.

When we say &quot;AI&quot; right now, we&#039;re referring to a technology called a &quot;Large Language Model.&quot; More or less, this works by reading &lt;i&gt;all of the internet&lt;/i&gt; and summarizing it as a big list of words and statistics about how those words tend to go together in sentences. When you ask it a question, it just imagines a page with that text at the top and guesses what the rest of the page would look like. Your answer is whatever continuation it makes up. The AI really &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; contain a lot of human knowledge, but the meaning is stripped out. All the AI knows is words. It can parrot back phrases, or even mix together sentences it&#039;s seen before, but it doesn&#039;t understand the question it was asked or the concepts it writes about. It doesn&#039;t think about what the task at hand is, what information would be relevant, or how to phrase a response so it will be understood correctly. It just generates some text that &lt;i&gt;looks like&lt;/i&gt; a good response at a glance, based on a statistical analysis of the English language. That response &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; be a well-formed, correct answer. The AI has read all the text on the internet, after all, and people &lt;i&gt;mostly&lt;/i&gt; write about real things honestly and accurately. But if the answer is correct, that&#039;s coincidental. The AI has no concept of correctness. It could also be garbage that &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; like a good answer if you don&#039;t know any better, which is kinda scary.

I hope that helps? I&#039;d be happy to field more questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just began reading “The age of AI…”, with Kissinger listed as its first author.  It appears that programming in AI is a compendium of stored knowledge, through which the device can sift and choose information it deems relevant to its current needs.  Is this an accurate interpretation of what I read?  It is somewhat confusing to a lay person. I am waiting for either you, or your  cousin  Steve, to explain it to me more fully. 
Love  reading your blogs.

Group selection and purposeful evolution are often used in naive and incorrect ways by people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about, which makes more reasonable / nuanced arguments along those lines sound untrustworthy by association. A lot of biologists just want to exclude that way of thinking entirely to avoid the problem, but I worry that&#039;s throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

The problem with the watch / watchmaker analogy is it assumes a sort of dualism. What if there is no dualism? What if the watch is the watchmaker?]]></description>

You write, &quot;Evolutionary biology is fraught with controversy over things like group selection or any hint of “purposeful” behavior. I think this is because of the legacy of fighting against Intelligent Design...&quot;  Interesting.  I can see how group selection can be seen as purposeful, but is it really more purposeful than ordinary, selfish selection?  We always have (at least) two stories about why something evolved, one of which involves describing what it evolved &#039;for&#039;.

It is indeed silly to say the parts of a clock cooperate for the good of the whole.  I&#039;d say the difference is that there&#039;s no obvious narrative available in which it makes sense to see the individual parts as making a decision how to behave--whether to cooperate or not.  A clockmaker may choose certain parts or processes for the good of the whole clock, though.

That account of DNA&#039;s possible origins as &quot;a molecule that could carry some information across generations&quot; is a useful one, since it seems cool and special, like a stealth weapon carried by a family&#039;s antibodies or something, until I remember that DNA itself is a molecule. :)]]></description>

I hope you had a lovely walk! I do my best thinking on walks.  :)

I&#039;m not exactly telling the &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; story of the cell, but I hope I&#039;ll touch on enough of that to satisfy you. Certainly, how complexity accumulates is one of the big questions I&#039;m exploring here.

Yes, I&#039;m very intentionally talking about single- and multi-celled organisms at the same time. Good observation.  :)  There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; some important differences (especially when it comes to &lt;i&gt;selection&lt;/i&gt;) and I&#039;ll bring up some of those in part three. But for the most part, it&#039;s remarkable how similar cells are across all species. It really does seem that multicellular organisms just reused the same self-programming tools that evolved for unicellular life to make bodies. It&#039;s just that body cells are programmed to adopt a mutually codependent lifestyle by default.

I&#039;m not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; talking about eusociality, but you&#039;re very right that I&#039;m entering that difficult territory. Evolutionary biology is fraught with controversy over things like group selection or any hint of &quot;purposeful&quot; behavior. I think this is because of the legacy of fighting against Intelligent Design, and the fact that it&#039;s a complex system, which is mathematically challenging and makes &quot;causality&quot; really hard to trace. I&#039;m walking right into the fray, because knowing some of the biology &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the computer science involved, I see a pretty compelling story. Still, we&#039;ll see what it takes to make a strong argument here. I&#039;m working on it.

I hope I&#039;ll address some of this in part two. The way I do it isn&#039;t to argue that individuals act for the good of the collective, but instead, I look at the collective &lt;i&gt;as an individual&lt;/i&gt;. I guess I&#039;m hoping that it&#039;s easier / safer to talk about the evolution of a complex system than to say the parts of that system act eusocially for the good of the whole. Like, it&#039;s silly to say the pieces of a mechanical clock &quot;cooperate for the good of the whole,&quot; yet it&#039;s undeniable that they do collectively make up a working machine. The main difference when I talk about life is &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; collective machine is self-modifying. Once you wrap your head around the collective view of evolution (hopefully I&#039;ll take you there in part two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f91e.png" alt="🤞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), it looks really different and makes more sense (at least to me).

This series won&#039;t get into the details of how the cell and its many complex systems evolved piece by piece. That&#039;s a very interesting problem, but one that I know little about, and still a hard open problem for science generally. You&#039;re right, though, that it would have to follow the same rules that Dennet and Dawkins have laid out. Complexity doesn&#039;t &quot;just happen,&quot; it has to benefit the organism in order to persist.

I very briefly touch on the idea of canalization in part three, and that might provide a clue. Perhaps this all started with just a persistent molecule that could carry some information across generations. That would be useful in itself, but it would be even &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; useful if an error correction system grew up around it. Or if the information was organized into patterns that were easier to read / interact with. Or if the data could be annotated, to prevent some parts from being read when they didn&#039;t apply. All those &quot;extras&quot; aren&#039;t &lt;i&gt;necessary&lt;/i&gt; for the proto-DNA to be useful, but they make it &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; useful. The more of those mechanisms build up around the proto-DNA, the more its role as the brain / engine of the cell becomes assured by the genome, and the more such &quot;extras&quot; can safely evolve to elaborate on it.

What&#039;s the story of the structure of the cell? Hoo-boy! It&#039;s quite a story  :)  If you&#039;re curious, I&#039;d recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4584057570&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Wetware&lt;/a&gt; by Dennis Bray. It&#039;s a short, friendly, and mind-blowing book about how cells do all sorts of complex physical and cognitive things with molecules.

As for the genetic code, I often get frustrated when people assert that it&#039;s &quot;solved.&quot; Yes, we know how codons are used to represent proteins, but that only accounts for 1-2% of the human genome. We know some other things, too, but I feel like we&#039;ve barely scratched the surface. To evoke a computer metaphor, we&#039;ve learned how to open up a binary in a hex editor, and immediately we can see the &quot;data&quot; blocks, with recognizable patterns in them that we can trace all the way through to the final organism. That&#039;s a big success, but that&#039;s the easy part! The rest of the program that uses that data is gobbledygook, and we don&#039;t even know if what we see in the DNA is &quot;the whole program.&quot; I suspect that it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;, just because the cell itself does a lot of complex stuff to read the DNA. I say more about that in my response to Mike&#039;s comment on this post...

These are great observations, Thorin! Thanks for bringing up these topics. It&#039;s fun and helpful for me to explore these other perspectives.]]></description>
