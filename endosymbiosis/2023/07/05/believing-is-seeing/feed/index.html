					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/07/05/believing-is-seeing/comment-page-1/#comment-178&quot;&gt;Thorin N. Tatge&lt;/a&gt;.

I really like your examples of how different conditions can dramatically alter your perception. It&#039;s especially neat how you talk about vague shapes &quot;resolving&quot; into an object once you remember what it is. That&#039;s a strange sensation that actually shows us a lot about how perception works. We don&#039;t talk about it much, which is weird since it&#039;s pretty common!

I agree, some older anti-racist material talks about stereotypes in an unhelpful way. Like, they point out common racial stereotypes that are wrong and hurtful, which is good. But, then what? Just, stop believing those things? Stop thinking in stereotypes all together? That&#039;s not really possible, so this advice mostly just makes people feel bad for having stereotypes (ie, being normal). I think it&#039;s more important to talk about what stereotypes are, how you acquire them, and how you use them. That way you can reason about when you might be mistaken and must take greater care. That&#039;s more practical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like that banana slug photo!  You&#039;re right, some of those yellow leaves look like they could be others.

I find it interesting when I&#039;m looking through my phone camera&#039;s viewfinder and being disappointed in how flat or somehow without context the scene seems that way, even before I take a picture.  If I had better camera skills, I might know how to evoke the opposite reaction--wonder at having coaxed such a nifty sight out of a less impressive reality.  Sometimes the flash function does this.

I watched those selective attention basketball videos some time ago, and I was caught by them both.

It can be weird, lying in bed and seeing something at a distance and not being able to place or even guess what it is.  What in the world could that big curvy thing be?  A milk jug?  Why would I have a milk jug on my desk?  Sometimes when I don&#039;t feel like getting up, I replay the last minutes or hours of my day in the same way I might retrace my steps looking for a lost object, trying to think of what in the what that strange outline could be.  Sometimes I remember and it resolves, its edges and curves and shadows now all making sense.  Sometimes it doesn&#039;t happen until I get up and can finally view it from another angle.

This is thoughtful material about the concept of stereotypes.  Sometimes people decry stereotypes in general, which bothers me, as it seems to me they&#039;re an essential cognitive function--this essay backs that up.  (It reminds me of when someone says &quot;I don&#039;t judge people,&quot; when really you can&#039;t help but judge people--it&#039;s natural and unavoidable.)  Then there are public figures and educators who talk about the dangers of &quot;harmful stereotypes,&quot; which may lead someone to wonder how they can distinguish between harmful and non-harmful ones.  I appreciate your take on that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is somewhat off topic, but I just recently got around to watching &#039;The Witch&#039; by Robert Eggers (I quite liked &#039;The Lighthouse&#039; as well). What I enjoy about the movie (both of them really), is the way the plot and perceptions of the characters are shaped by their supernatural beliefs.]]></description>
