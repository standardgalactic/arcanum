Anti-fragility doesn’t involve the brain, conscious or unconscious. It’s a kind of learning that happens in the body tissues themselves. My muscles “know” whether they are getting the job done. They can tell if they are actually contracting and relaxing when they get the signal, whether that was easy or hard, and whether they sustained any damage in the attempt. They recognize how often they are put to use, and whether they are usually exhausted or ready for action.

Generally speaking, muscles conserve energy by doing as little as possible. But when I regularly demand more of them, they adapt. They become bigger, stronger, and more responsive. They consume more energy at rest so they’re always ready for action when I need them. They become less lazy, working harder by default, which makes them stronger still. This requires more protein to build the muscles, and more calories to power them. So my metabolism adapts, too. I eat more and my body burns more calories continuously, rather than storing them as fat.

What’s so fascinating is how all three ways of learning work together. With conscious thought, I choose to change my behavior. I master new facts and cues, so I know what I’m doing at an intellectual level, and can execute new skills (poorly, at first). With practice, not only do I refine those skills, but I engage an unconscious learning process that makes them fully automatic. I can focus my mind on the task I want to accomplish, and trust my body will just perform all the complex movements I need to pull it off. My muscles may not be up to the challenge at first, but that’s fine. With willpower, I push my tissues to their limits, and they learn to do what I ask. By the principle of anti-fragility, my body automatically remodels itself, increasing strength, flexibility, or stamina precisely where they’re needed. It makes itself a better robot, one that can live the lifestyle my mind consciously chooses. These three learning processes work independently, yet together they make a dynamic human being, one that can just as well become a yogi, a warrior, a marathon runner, or a weightlifter.

Intelligence isn’t just about brains, it’s about bodies, too, and about multiple intelligent systems working together in complex ways. I hope this was a helpful example, but as always I’m looking for feedback. Is this an experience you can relate to? Have you observed these different systems within yourself? Do you think it helps to know what’s going on intellectually, or do you approach physical training in a different way? Any other thoughts or observations to share? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.

New Coding Project
I just published a new coding project! If you’ve been following along, this is the “grown up” version of a demo project I posted last year.

It’s further exploration of what I call an “epigenetic algorithm.” It’s inspired by a simple observation: in living cells, the process of evolution is actively managed by the cell, which itself is an evolved mechanism. Using evolution to optimize evolution seems like a powerful trick, so I’m trying to reproduce it in small-scale AI experiments. I hope to make evolutionary computing more open-ended, more successful in vast search spaces, and less biased by the programmer. In this case, I’m generating cool looking Game of Life simulations, but I hope to find many more practical applications in the future.

I’m not sure whether or not I will publish this as a work of science. It’s complicated and weird and there’s more work involved to make this a proper controlled experiment. As I learn more, I’m already thinking of other ways to explore this idea that might be more effective. So, for now, the plan is just to share the code and I may or may not revisit this later, depending on where my other leads take me.  🙂

I gave a presentation that covers the motivation, results, and challenges of this project for a technical audience.

You can also peruse the source code and results on GitHub.

Sorry this is less accessible than my usual blog posts! If you have any questions, just drop them in the comments, and I’ll happily answer them.

Free will?
This is me experimenting with sharing shorter, less polished posts when the inspiration strikes. Let me know in the comments what you think.

There’s been a recent bout of people talking about free will and determinism. Perhaps because of Sapolsky’s book, Determined?

But so much of the discussion I see is grounded in a very strange conception of free will. For many people, “free will” means that a mind must have the power to bypass causation and alter reality purely because it wants to, without any external influences.

This is very silly. It’s secret dualism. It’s like saying free will only exists if my transcendent soul can reach into the universe (from outside?) and arbitrarily tinker with physics. Science tells us that this sort of free will does not exist. But rather than throw out the concept entirely, maybe we just need a better definition?

When talking philosophy, it’s so important to establish good definitions.

If the Universe is determined, then so are we. We can’t break the laws of physics. In some sense our behavior is unchangeable. We make choices, but if you re-ran the Universe in precisely the same way, we’d act the same every time.

But so what? Even this kind of decision is real and meaningful. We choose based on our experiences and our preferences. Those aren’t in our control, but they’re still “us.” Those choices matter. They determine how the Universe unfolds, and what experiences we all have. We really do make things better or worse, as we choose.

Maybe we don’t change reality. Maybe it was always gonna be this way. But so what? The Universe is vast and chaotic. Even if it’s theoretically predictable, practically it’s not. It’s pure fantasy to think we can accurately predict even a single person’s actions beyond the next few moments.

Even if we’re determined: we experience, we consider, we choose, we act, and that determines what comes next. That feels like “free will” enough for me.

The point of Sapolsky’s book is that we are animals, with innate biases and limitations. We live in a society that determines how we live our lives. We have experiences that shape us. We shape our selves, but only the parts that aren’t determined by reality. We can’t take “full credit,” because so much is just luck.

So where do we get off torturing people in prison for being “evil”? People aren’t evil. People can be selfish, delusional, psychopathic, traumatized, desperate, etc. Maybe they need help. Maybe they’re dangerous to themselves or others. Maybe society should intervene. But to a large extent they didn’t choose that life, but were forced there by circumstances beyond their control. So when we intervene, why the nastiness? Why should we punish someone for being born with a genetic mutation, or an abusive father?

I’m not sure I completely agree with Sapolsky, but he makes a good point worth considering. I don’t want people to reject it because “free will” doesn’t mean what they think it means.

Hello there, reader. I hope you’ve been enjoying the blog. It’s been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That’s going great, but it’s keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.

So far, I’ve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don’t think I can keep up that pace. I’ve got a few finished posts queued up, but I’ve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every three months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We’ll see!

In the meantime, I thought I’d share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I’m about two thirds of the way through my first semester.

Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It’s electrifying. I don’t know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I’m often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they’re pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I’m reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I’m integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I’m learning isn’t radically new or different, but I’m fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.

I haven’t had much time to work on research yet, but I’m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others’, and vice versa. It’s helping see new angles and new possibilities. I’m talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I’d like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I’m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It’s forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others’ ideas.
