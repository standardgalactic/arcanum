<p>There’s something very romantic about “the Age of Dinosaurs.” Before the familiar ecosystems of today, there was a completely different world order. Bizarre and fantastic species, strange environments and ways of living, another planet buried in the past of our familiar home. Yet, that was just one stage in our planet’s evolution—one that’s relatively recent, and similar to our own. It’s easy to forget that amniotes (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and the like) have only been around for 10% of Earth’s history, or about 300 million years. By comparison, single cells were the only life on Earth for 2.8 <em>billion</em> years. We sometimes hand wave over that period and say “not much happened,” but in that time life somehow went from accidentally self-perpetuating chemical reactions to swarms of intelligent microrobots that coordinate by the trillions to dominate every corner of the globe. This was the time of some of life’s most important and profound innovations, including essential concepts that made large-scale life possible.</p>



<p>About four billion years ago, the molten Earth finally cooled enough to form a solid crust of rock that could hold liquid water. Just 200 million years later, we see evidence of cells in the fossil record. In other words, it took just 200 million years for chance chemical reactions to become “self aware.” These early cells had no minds, of course, but they had membranes separating their insides from their outsides. They actively monitored and maintained the delicate balance of metabolic processes keeping them alive. Yet that was just the beginning of the journey, the basic foundation that made all the rest possible. From there, it took cells another billion years to cover the planet’s surface, and they’ve been ubiquitous ever since.</p>



<p>In that time, not much happened… from the human perspective. If you visited Earth at the time, it would look pretty boring. You might notice some slimes or biofilms, but you’d need a microscope to really appreciate that as “life.” Yet, gradually, microbes terraformed the planet. They found and exploited every available source of energy, and developed a molecular toolkit for extracting resources from a dead world. They mined useful molecules from the air, water, and rock, transforming and concentrating them for future generations. They remade the atmosphere, filling it with volatile oxygen, providing an energy-dense fuel for organisms to come. They created a protective layer of ozone that blocked DNA-frying radiation and made land habitable for the first time. This would all be invisible to a human observer because it happened so <em>slowly</em>, but the scale and significance of this transformation is incredible, especially coming from such tiny, mindless lifeforms. How could this happen?</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest misconception about evolution is that simpler forms of life are “less evolved” than we are. The reality is that everything alive today has a common ancestor, and has had just as much time to evolve from there. Even bacteria are highly sophisticated organisms. They sense light, heat, motion, and chemicals. They sniff out food and resources, and navigate their environment. They hunt and evade predators. They learn and remember. They coordinate their behaviors with pheromone signaling. They sustain themselves, repair themselves, and make copies of themselves. In many ways, a single bacterium is <em>vastly</em> more impressive than anything made by humans. Like all life, they’re very good at what they do, but appreciating that intelligence means taking their perspective, which is rather difficult for humans.</p>



<p>For example, microbes experience evolution quite differently than we do. For humans, it’s a very abstract concept. It only matters on the scale of <em>many</em> generations, which may take thousands or millions of years. In contrast, a colony of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. They evolve over the course of hours, so for them it’s a real-time problem solving tool. There’s a fascinating experiment where bacteria took just eleven days to incrementally evolve resistance to antibiotics at a concentration 1,000 times what was originally a lethal dose. You can actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE&amp;t=92s&amp;ab_channel=ScienceNews">watch</a> as the population discovers innovations that allow them to resist the poison and expand into new territory. When they do, they get a brief moment of total freedom, spreading unhindered until they start to get competition from their fellow mutants for the limited space remaining.</p>



<p><em>This</em> is what cells are really good at. Not just living one lifestyle, but finding new lifestyles. In a crowded, competitive world, the best way for an organism to set itself apart is novelty: gaining access to an empty niche, or finding some innovative way to out-compete its neighbors. Doing this over, and over, and over again is how life managed to colonize every corner of this planet, from underwater volcanic vents, to Antarctic ice, to your gut. Exploration and creativity is also critical for long-term survival. On a geologic time scale, niches and lifestyles are transient, coming and going as changes in environmental conditions and competition from other species reshape the landscape. Staying alive means constantly adapting and trying new strategies. On a fundamental level, this is what life does.</p>



<p>This perspective helps explain one of the strange things about cells. Every living thing we know—every single cell, even the most ancient and primitive Archaea—has a general-purpose design. At their core, there’s a 3D printer for proteins, capable of mass producing molecules in a mind-boggling variety of shapes. Those proteins form the structure and machinery of the cell, help digest various food stuffs, neutralize toxins, and perform computations. Importantly, this 3D printer doesn’t just produce every protein a cell needs to live. It can make <em>any</em> protein, from any species, even proteins that haven’t been discovered yet. This would be massively overkill for living in any single niche, but it’s the ideal tool for conquering <em>every</em> niche. This complex, general-purpose cell design was so powerful that it out-competed and replaced everything simpler.</p>



<p>DNA mostly consists of programs for that 3D printer. It’s a collection of recipes for proteins, and cues for when to make them. Life hoards those recipes. They represent tools and behaviors that were once useful in the past. Right now, they might <em>not</em> be useful. They may even be harmful, disabled, and packed away where they can do no damage, but they aren’t forgotten. They lie dormant, waiting to be re-enabled on demand or by accident, just in case they might one day prove useful again. After all, who knows when the next global catastrophe will completely rewrite the rules of survival on this planet?</p>



<p>In other words, cells specialize in exploring the space of possible forms and lifestyles. They build up massive libraries of tools and strategies in their DNA. They continuously reprogram themselves, adapting to any conditions in order to find new niches. Macroscopic life, from butterflies to avocados to whales, is only possible because of this polymorphic quality of cells. They are the secret ingredient. They are like “smart matter” that can act autonomously, respond in real time, take on any shape, produce any chemical, and implement any behavior. Once you have that, it’s relatively easy to program those cells to construct just the right mix of forms, organized in just the right way, to make something much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>I hope this conveys some of why I find cellular intelligence so exciting. Humans are most interested in human things, so it’s very easy to ignore the incredibly alien lives happening right under our noses. Yet, there’s so much to explore, and so much of what we are <em>is</em> that “alien” cellular intelligence. What do you think? Did this help you see single cells or life in general in a different light? Did this spark any questions or ideas? Anything you’d like to see me explore more in a future post? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(featuring an illustration by <a href="https://www.sarinamitchel.com/">Sarina Mitchel</a>)</p>



<p>Big brains are essential to our success as a species. That&#8217;s how we dominated this planet, so we tend look there to understand the secrets of intelligence. Yet, this perspective blinds us to other species’ achievements. Take plants, for instance. They don’t have brains at all, yet they make up over 82% of Earth’s biomass (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/total-biomass-weight-species-earth#:~:text=The%20total%20biomass%20on%20planet,of%20all%20biomass%20on%20Earth.">source</a>). They range in size from single celled algae to the largest organism on earth (learn about Pando <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC8abuKnr90">here</a>). Many of our greatest discoveries in chemistry, medicine, and material science amount to finding some plant that already solved a problem better than we could. Yet, we tend to see them as material resources rather than intelligent living beings. I suspect we underestimate plants because, from a certain perspective, they don’t do very much. They just sit there, letting food and water come to them. What’s so smart about that?</p>



<p>This perspective says more about human impatience than anything else. Plants can climb and tunnel and build. They search their environment for resources, relocate to prime spots, and wrestle with each other for access. They capture prey, hide from predators, and actively defend themselves from attackers. They can transform themselves dramatically, switching between totally different strategies depending on time of day, time of year, and environmental conditions. Plants are very active. It’s just on a different time scale than we’re used to. Plant movement is most obvious over hours, days, and years, though in some cases they move dramatically in just seconds.</p>



<p>Brains allow us to move quickly, which gives us a big advantage over plants, but I don’t think it makes us “more intelligent.” It’s better to say we found different strategies, specializing in different kinds of intelligence. Plants are slow and stationary because that’s <em>energy efficient</em>. It allows them to thrive in otherwise barren environments. Animals can’t do this. We all depend on plants for survival. Our extravagant, free-moving lifestyle is only possible because plants do the slow, hard work of capturing energy and nutrients from the air and soil, making concentrated fuel for our activity. Plants don’t <em>need</em> brains to live the way they do, and they don&#8217;t let that stop them from adopting all sorts of complex behaviors and lifestyles.</p>



<p>This is possible in part because plants often root themselves to the ground. That may seem like a poor choice, since it limits their options dramatically. They have to commit to one environment for their whole lives. Either that spot provides what they need, or it doesn&#8217;t and they&#8217;re doomed to die there. But there’s a major upside to this strategy: their lives are much more predictable than ours. This makes it possible for evolution to carefully plan responses to just about every threat or opportunity a plant might encounter in its lifetime. This is a different kind of intelligence than what we’re used to, one focused on exquisite design and finely crafted behavioral scripts, rather than spontaneity. Plants do respond in the moment, though, and even rooted to the ground they can be surprisingly mobile.</p>



<p>The most common and obvious way that plants move is through growth. Animals can’t really move until they’ve grown a body, but plants move by growing. They use their senses to track and follow the sun, water, and chemical nutrients they depend on. They feel the pull of gravity, the strain caused by the wind, and physical touch along their bodies. They change their shape by growing cells larger, faster, or in thicker layers on this side, but not that side. This allows them to reinforce themselves and stay upright, grope and crawl around obstacles to reach food, navigate wide open spaces with roots or runners, or wrap around trellises to pull themselves toward the sun.</p>



<p>Plants can also move by shifting water around their bodies in a process known as turgor. Cells with more water swell, while those with less shrink. By shifting water between cells in its stalk, a sunflower can rotate throughout the day to track the arc of the sun. Morning glories and lotuses use similar methods to hide and protect their delicate flowers at night, then unfurl them into extravagant displays to attract pollinators during the daytime. Although turgor is much slower than muscle contraction, it’s still fast enough to react to animals. The touch-me-not mimosa, sundew, and venus fly trap all move quickly in response to physical touch. A few species, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaTOoVmg1Q">hairy bittercress</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBg0In8Dtw">squirting cucumber</a>, are much more dramatic. They build up pressure behind a catch mechanism, then suddenly launch their seeds into the air with explosive force.</p>



<p>Plants are also masters of using weather and animals to help them move. Plants have evolved specialized seeds that travel great distances, allowing whole populations of plants to migrate and colonize new territory. You’ve probably encountered helicopter seeds that gracefully twirl through the air, dandelion seeds that ride the wind on floofy parasols, and burrs that hitch a ride on your pant leg. The energy for this motion doesn’t come from the plant itself, so should that even count? As an engineer, that sort of practical laziness just makes the design more impressive to me. The plant doesn’t bother capturing and reshaping energy for this, because it doesn’t have to. All it has to do is build the seed in the right shape and “let go” at the right moment.</p>



<p>What does all this tell us about intelligence? For one thing, life doesn’t need a brain to navigate obstacles, seek out resources, climb, glide, follow a daily routine, catch prey, or even launch projectiles. Plants are full of amazing behaviors that are completely mindless, yet elegant, successful, and highly optimized. We&#8217;ll never understand those behaviors by studying brains or Deep Learning algorithms, but they tell us a lot about ourselves. Our brains do not <em>replace</em> the kind of embodied intelligence we see so clearly in plants, they merely <em>extend</em> it. We depend very much on the same evolutionary design and “script-making” that governs the plant kingdom. Under the hood, much of what makes us intelligent comes down to the cells of our bodies, dynamically shifting chemical concentrations and patterns of growth, very much like plants do.</p>



<p>I hope to share several more posts about plants and fungi in the future, because there really is a lot to say. If you’re interested in going deeper on the topic of plant intelligence, I highly recommend the 1996 film <em>Microcosmos</em>. It explores the plants and tiny creatures in a meadow with some extraordinary macro and time-lapse photography. No other movie has given me a more vivid and profound sense of awe at how <em>alive</em> the world is, at every scale. Sadly, the streaming options are limited right now, but it’s worth it if you can get your hands on it.</p>



<p>As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What are your favorite examples of plants being amazing? Are there other kinds of “mindless intelligence” you’d like to see me write about? How do you think about the intelligence of plants and animals? How are they similar and how are they different? Let me know in the comments.</p>
