<p>(this post&#8217;s image is a cross stitch I made from <a href="https://studioansitru.bigcartel.com/product/don-t-be-a-prick-digital-download-only">a pattern by Studio Ansitru</a>. The phrase &#8220;don&#8217;t be a prick&#8221; is surrounded by a variety of cacti in pretty greens and oranges on a light blue background. In my home, it serves as a reminder to myself and to my guests.)</p>



<p>A popular metaphor for the mind is a pilot sitting in a cockpit, monitoring the senses and making every decision. This is obviously nonsense, but it’s an intuitive and helpful metaphor at times. The brain really does have “an executive” that thinks and plans and makes decisions, it just doesn’t have “a mind of its own,” and its power over the self is surprisingly limited. Self-control and -awareness are important for living a good life, being productive, and making ethical decisions. Unfortunately, when these faculties fail, as they often do, it&#8217;s easy to blame yourself. I find it helps to understand how these systems work, so I can set more realistic expectations for myself, which makes me less disappointed when things go awry.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important thing to know about the brain is that it’s not one, unified thing. Brains are modular, with many distinct regions specialized for different tasks. Each region has different inputs and outputs, meaning they each monitor the world in different ways from different perspectives, and can cause different behaviors. Observations, insights, desires, and actions can originate in pretty much any part of the brain. All of these different regions operate together at the same time, and conscious experience is an integration of all that activity. What I think, feel, believe, and do is mostly the product of what specific regions in my brain activate together, and in what order.</p>



<p>This story of how brains work is surprisingly consistent across the animal kingdom. Even very simple creatures, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5010568365">honey bees</a> for instance, have complex brains with specialized regions and global integration that likely creates a sort of conscious awareness. It seems likely, however, that bees lack the sort of self-awareness and top-down control that humans do. Without it, the brain is more chaotic. Each part tries to do the right thing more or less independently. Integration means that most faculties are aware of each other and can influence each other, so there is some coordination and consistency. But focus is mostly determined by which brain region is loudest, and decisions happen moment by moment, without planning or intentional coherence.</p>



<p>Decentralized brains work extremely well, but they have their limitations. More complex animals have more versatile behaviors that need more explicit coordination to generate coherent, reliable, and goal-directed behavior. Most large animals seem to have this ability. In all mammals, it’s more or less identified with a brain region known as the prefrontal cortex, or PFC. The PFC is responsible for monitoring all the activity in the brain. It builds up a rich model of the self, its relationships, needs, and long-term goals. It’s responsible for planning and for exerting control over other parts of the brain. It can shut out distractions and use willpower to encourage good behaviors and discourage bad ones, even when I’d selfishly prefer to do something else.</p>



<p><em>The PFC tells the story of “you,” and has strong opinions about how that story is supposed to go.</em></p>



<p>Although all mammals have a PFC (and many other species have something analogous), the relative <em>size</em> of the PFC varies quite a bit between species, and that seems to correlate with executive control and what people often think of as “intelligence.” Animals with large PFCs are better at self-control, problem solving, and forming complex social relationships. Humans have exceptionally large PFCs, which partly explains why we’re so different from other species. It’s important to remember, though, this is a difference in magnitude, not in kind. It’s likely that <em>every</em> mammal and <em>many</em> other species have human-like self-awareness and self-control. It’s just a weaker faculty for them, one that acts less often, and is less able to dominate the rest of the mind.</p>



<p>The PFC is the closest thing to a “pilot” the brain has, but it’s better to think of it as just one brain region among many. It’s one voice in a chorus. It tends to be more bossy, spending a lot of energy trying to influence or even override other parts of the brain, but it’s not “in control.” Like a corporate executive, the PFC has only limited visibility into what the rest of the brain is doing, can’t afford to stay ever-vigilant, and can’t <em>force</em> a brain region to fall in line, especially when the orders run counter to that region’s nature. The PFC also isn’t capable of doing much on its own. It depends on the rest of the brain to notice things, interpret them, suggest actions, and implement them. All it can do is adjudicate and coordinate. It resolves conflict, makes plans, and advises each brain region about when and how to do its thing.</p>



<p>One consequence of all this is that self-control is actually a very limited and fragile thing. Often, my PFC just sits back and lets the rest of the brain work with minimal intervention. Usually that works great, but sometimes it means I miss something important. I may act out of impulse or habit and not notice until it’s too late that I’m going against my values, intentions, or best interests. Other times I know exactly what I <em>should</em> do, but can’t seem to make it happen. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. I can’t force myself to sit down, focus, and avoid distractions. Perhaps I’m grumpy, tired, or impatient and I do something rude or inappropriate without meaning to at all.</p>



<p>When this happens, it’s easy to blame myself. I lost control. I did something foolish. I acted selfishly and impulsively, like a bad person. In reality, though, this happens all the time, usually for mundane reasons that I have little control over. The PFC is energy intensive, so it gets impaired whenever my blood sugar is low, I’m tired, or I’m stressed. Other brain regions also have the ability to <em>interfere</em> with the PFC, especially the limbic system which manages emotions and the fight-or-flight response. Some diseases (like depression and long COVID) can cause “brain fog,” which is closely related to reduced executive function. It’s also possible to injure the PFC, from a stroke, a tumor, or a physical injury (as in the famous case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>).</p>



<p>Knowing this helps me feel a little less personally responsible when I have a lapse of self-control. It really is inevitable, common, and completely natural. Still, I want to have good judgment and do the right thing as much as possible! How do I do that? One answer is to simply be aware of my limitations and to work around them. I try to notice when I’m hungry, tired, or emotional and avoid making big decisions or socializing at those times. Instead, I might get a snack, take a break, or sleep on it so I feel more in control. The only other good technique I know is mindfulness meditation. Despite the mystical reputation, the main purpose of meditation is quite practical: it trains the PFC. By practicing the skill of observing the mind and exerting influence over it, I can build that muscle. It’s not a silver bullet, but meditation helps me use my PFC more often and more effectively, and it makes me more aware of when my PFC is in a weakened state.</p>



<p>So, in a sense, there really is a “pilot” in every brain. It’s just not an ever vigilant, intelligent, wise, and rational person. Instead, it’s one brain region out of many, with limited visibility and a narrow job description. The PFC observes what the other brain regions are seeing, thinking, and doing and uses that top-down view to nudge them into more coherent and effective patterns of behavior. It’s not “the self” and it’s not “in control.” In fact, it has very limited influence, isn’t always active, and even with training there are lots of common reasons it might grow weak or misbehave. For this reason, having great self-control is often less about will power in the moment, and more about avoiding temptation in the first place.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this agree with your first-hand experience? Do you have any insights you could share about self-awareness, self-control, or motivation? What about being kind to yourself when your self-control inevitably falls short? If so, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(This post&#8217;s photo from the family farm circa 2004. From left to right: Tommie, Josh, and Trevor. This post&#8217;s content is inspired by conversations with vet tech, horse person, and my mother, Sandie Gaylinn)</p>



<p>My childhood home life was centered around animals. I grew up on a working farm, with cats and dogs as siblings, and a responsibility to help care for the horses, chickens, and all the rest. I had daily close contact with many animals and we formed long-lasting relationships. We grew up together, did activities together, and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. I cared for them when they were sick, and sometimes <em>they</em> would reach out to me when I was in need of comfort. Although we were obviously very different, and by necessity the animals had less freedom, I found it hard to think of them as “just” pets or livestock. They were part of the family.</p>



<p>I believe that all mammals are very similar in terms of their emotions and intelligence. This comes from many years of observation, empathy, and intuition. It’s hard for me to prove it, yet it’s harder still for me to dismiss it. Humans are more intelligent than other animals in a few narrow yet critical ways, but when I hear someone say non-human animals are “less conscious”, or that they can’t possibly comprehend the world like us, I get offended. It just seems naive, given what I’ve seen. I don’t fault others for that opinion. I assume it comes from a lack of exposure, or from human-centric bias. Of course, I have my own biases. The scientific evidence is far from conclusive, so I figure we should all keep an open mind.</p>



<p>What do I mean when I say all mammals are very similar? For one, it seems the palette of emotions is basically the same. We experience happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and pain in roughly the same way (which is why animal abuse is morally wrong). Each species has different body language, but if you pay close attention, you can learn to read their emotions quite clearly. We also respond to the world in similar ways. A sudden windfall makes us happy and excited, but it may inspire envy in others who see it. This is true whether we’re talking about humans, dogs, or squirrels. Many emotional responses seem universal.</p>



<p>Each individual has a unique personality, which means some emotions and responses are more common for them. Some folks are more optimistic, quick to anger, or self-conscious. Some less. Each species has personalities in a particular range. Dogs tend to be outgoing approval-seekers; cats are aloof and independent; horses are social, but skittish. But these stereotypes only apply on average. It’s common to see cats who act like dogs, or vice versa. There’s also a lot of overlap between species, which is why it’s easy to make friends with an animal whose personality aligns with your own.</p>



<p>When it comes to intelligence, there’s a lot more variation between species, but I wouldn&#8217;t rank animals by IQ. Each species and each individual is <em>different</em>, with unique strengths and weaknesses. Animals can be incredibly intelligent, but only in ways that are relevant to their lives. It’s unfair to judge a horse by its ability to do arithmetic, just as it’s unfair to judge a human by its ability to discriminate odors. Sadly, this makes humans generally blind to the ways animals may be more intelligent than us. We don’t tend to see or appreciate what doesn’t matter in our lives, we only see what we have in common. That makes social intelligence a good example, since many mammals specialize in it.</p>



<p>Horses are very social animals. A herd has a strict pecking order, but it&#8217;s not so straightforward as an ordered list. Their relationships can be just as nuanced, contextual, and tangled as with humans. Since horses spend so much of their time grazing, a school cafeteria feels like the right metaphor. They form cliques, with different levels of status. Some individuals move freely from table to table, hanging out with the nerds one day and the social climbers the next, while others get chased away if they try to do the same. Horses with higher status will tease, harass, and steal from those with lower status, mostly just to assert dominance. Certain foods or activities may become trendy, starting with one individual, then spreading to a clique or the whole herd. Sometimes, this is how a horse manages to climb the social ladder.</p>



<p>When a new kid comes to the lunch room, they usually get hazed. As a prey species that depends on the support of their herd for survival, horses are generally shy and cautious by nature. The newcomer knows they are at the mercy of the herd and must make a good impression, so they tend to suck it up and bear the torment. Usually, they’re welcome to join the nerd table, hanging out with their fellow losers until they work their way up the ladder. Horses with higher social status will make a point of asserting dominance at every opportunity. Occasionally, they choose to extend an olive branch instead, but this is a risky move which can have complex social repercussions.</p>



<p>At least, that’s how it usually goes. When my mom introduced Dakota to the herd, that’s what we prepared for. To try and head-off the worst of the hazing, we put Dakota in an adjoining paddock for a week. This way, the herd could get over their initial excitement, and Dakota got a chance to learn how things worked and what she was getting into. She observed the herd’s schedule, habits, and social dynamics. She saw them waiting in the lunch line and bickering over the water trough and the best grazing spots. She could see who the cool kids were, what set them apart from the others, and how they would assert themselves over the nerds.</p>



<p>When we let Dakota into the main field, we were all on hand to make sure it didn’t get out of hand, and to intervene if necessary. The whole herd quickly figured out what was going on and lined up (in their usual cliques, sorted by pecking order) near the fence to get a good look and wait their turn to pick on the newcomer. But Dakota took everyone by surprise. She stood tall and proud, walked straight up to the dominant male, and kicked him so hard it knocked him off his feet! The gelding, Johnny, couldn’t let this stand, of course. He gave her back as good as she dished out, but after that demonstration of her strength and confidence, he didn’t want to push his luck. It was over in under a minute, and the others were left so in awe of her that they’d spend the next few weeks sucking up.</p>



<p>Of course, violence was what we on the sidelines most feared. Even with no shoes on, as was the case here, a direct kick from a horse can be incredibly powerful and damaging. But we were actually relieved at what we saw. Dakota was going for dramatic effect, not injury. Her blow wasn’t very hard. She managed to hit Johnny in just the right spot with just enough force to throw him off balance. It only worked because she caught him off guard. It ended the conflict so quickly because it made him look like a fool, and shook his confidence. In effect, it was a bluff, and one that worked really well on this mild-mannered herd where even the &#8220;tough guys&#8221; were pretty gentle. A well-timed sucker punch made her look like a total badass, even though she would have lost in a fair fight.</p>



<p>It’s easy to imagine this scene in a cafeteria, but it was remarkable to see with horses, who are rarely so audacious. With one decisive move, Dakota asserted herself as the dominant female, upending the pecking order, and bypassing weeks or months of conflict and social climbing. It was smart, effective, and seemingly premeditated. She had a week to prepare. When she was led to the main field, she knew all eyes were on her. She put on her game face and acted smoothly, without hesitation. Did she reason about social dynamics and fight tactics? Did she choose a strategy and plan its execution? Or was she just improvising, driven by instinct to do what “felt right”? It’s hard to say. I&#8217;d say it was probably a blend of both, and that the balance doesn’t matter. Intelligence is intelligence. This was a smart move, regardless of where it came from.</p>



<p>I hope this is a compelling example of animal intelligence. If you’re thinking, “maybe that <em>looks</em> like a school cafeteria, but what humans do is totally different,” then I ask you to reconsider. People are very good at finding reasons for what we do. The nerds are outcasts, not because of some arbitrary social hierarchy, but because they like Pokémon and other objectively uncool things. We don’t bite one another on the flank just to inflict pain and embarrassment, like horses do. We use words and reasoning to settle disputes, like when we sling insults at each other. To me, it often feels like humans (self included) are behaving <em>exactly</em> like “more primitive” mammals. We just cover everything with a social veneer that makes it feel more sophisticated. When looking at human conflicts, I find it’s quite helpful to strip the words and meaning away and instead look at the raw power dynamics and emotions. Often that explains the situation much better than the stories people tell.</p>



<p>What do you think? Am I being too generous with animals, and seeing what I want to see? Does this remind you of another cool animal story you’d like to share? Any questions about horses that need answering? If so, please leave a comment below and join the conversation. If you want to learn more about animal intelligence, I recommend these books about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427379311?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">ravens</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4427380446?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">octopuses</a>. Very cool animals, far less familiar to most of us than mammals, and yet surprisingly similar in many ways.</p>
