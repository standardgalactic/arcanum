<p class="has-small-font-size">(This month&#8217;s featured image is a <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/031/01G77PKB8NKR7S8Z6HBXMYATGJ">photo of the Carina Nebula</a> taken by NASA&#8217;s James Webb telescope.

The colorized image almost looks like orange mountains with a blue mist rising from them, set on a black background with bright, six-sided starbursts.)</p>



<p>Normally, when we talk about evolution, we mean what life does. It’s Darwin’s magic formula. You need reproduction. You need to pass on a copy of your genes, with a little variation, so things don’t just stay the same. Natural selection will weed out the less fit individuals, so they have fewer kids. The more fit individuals become more prevalent and, over time, life as a whole evolves to be more fit. Yet, this isn’t a very satisfying story. For one thing, how did it begin? Did life just start evolving out of the blue? I think story is more compelling if we think about evolution a bit more abstractly. In a sense, the physical universe itself evolves. It doesn’t have reproduction and inheritance, but it sure does have variation and selection, and this has caused it to change dramatically over the course of history.</p>



<p>For the first 370,000 years or so, all of space was filled with a boring, homogeneous cloud of energy and plasma. That universe is now extinct, and for one simple reason: it was unstable. In our universe, stability is the ultimate definition of “fitness.” What persists, exists. Patterns of matter and energy that get generated more often and stick around longer become more prevalent. Those that are rare and fragile exist only fleetingly. The plasma universe is gone because gravity causes matter to clump together. It was like a pencil, balanced on its tip. As soon as it became just a little unbalanced, it rapidly fell farther and farther away from that delicate equilibrium. Plasma condensed into molecules, gas clouds, and stars.</p>



<p>Of course, evolution needs variation to work. To find what&#8217;s better, you need to weed out what&#8217;s worse. For life, reproduction is the engine of variation, but that isn’t necessary if you have unimaginably vast scale. The universe started out with very little variation, but it steadily increased as matter interacted with itself. Gravity caused hydrogen molecules to group together in uneven clumps, and held them there. They sat around for millions of years, slowly growing bigger, until the force of their own weight ignited a fusion reaction. The gas clouds became stars, and in their cores new elements were born. The universe’s population gradually became more diverse.</p>



<p>That’s the counterintuitive thing about stability: it can generate diversity. When patterns become more numerous, and they stick around for longer, chaos starts to kick in. Every star and every planet is a little different. They have unique histories and influences and opportunities. They might be richer in this element or that one, bigger or smaller, hotter or colder, more or less affected by collisions. This diversity only compounds over time, as these objects smash together and interact in complex ways. The longer they stick around, the more they change, recombine, and become more elaborate.</p>



<p>So, for 13 billion years, the universe evolved. Its population became stranger and more complicated. Today we have about a hundred “naturally occurring” elements that didn’t exist at first, but had to evolve through multiple generations of stars fusing atoms, exploding violently, and gradually reforming. We have many <em>kinds</em> of stars, planets, solar systems, and galaxies, that support an astonishing variety of chemical processes that have had a very, very long time to develop. They produce “primordial soups,” pocket environments full of useful molecules for life, a steady energy source, and self-perpetuating chemical reactions. We think this happened at least once to seed all life on Earth, but it may in fact be very common.</p>



<p>I think this story is an essential foundation for understanding evolution as life does it. Because life didn’t start this process. The universe provides energy and raw materials in vast amounts. It provides the chaos and entropy that drives seemingly random variation, and the slow, continual breaking down that causes natural selection to prefer stable, commonly made forms. The laws of physics cause the universe to evolve towards stability, diversity, and complexity, at least for a while, until it starts to wind down again and settle into entropy. Life merely <em>constrains</em> that process, making it more efficient and productive, for the simple reason that matter that does so becomes more prevalent.</p>



<p>In these primordial soups, some chemical systems evolved to enclose themselves in bubbles, protecting delicate reactions from the outside world. These self-made &#8220;individuals&#8221; evolved regular cycles of reproduction, explicitly making copies of themselves rather than waiting for the right reactants to come together again by chance. They evolved DNA to constrain these copies, and make them more precise reproductions of the original. They evolved sophisticated error checking, which made the copies more robust and reliable. But this also gave life the power to <em>manage</em> variation across generations, and thus shape its own evolution. Life evolved sex to further manage variation, accelerating innovation by sharing genetic recipes across lineages. Life evolved an <em>astonishing variety</em> of sexual and reproductive practices, allowing it to evolve in different ways, with different patterns of variation and selection, each suited to a different range of environments and lifestyles.</p>



<p>The physical Universe evolves—in the most primitive way imaginable, but it still produces stability and complexity in a <em>vast</em> number of diverse forms. It generates the seeds of life, without any guidance or direction. Life evolves differently, because it constrains this process, making it discrete, digital, and managed. This started very simply, just discovering chemical reactions that isolate and maintain themselves. But perhaps this is the origin of what we think of as “intelligence” or “agency”? Without noticing, matter became “opinionated,” preferring certain forms and acting explicitly to promote them. From there, life’s “opinions” about itself only became more demanding and elaborate.</p>



<p>We often present evolution as one simple story, but there are many ways to evolve. Evolution is more like a general principle than a specific algorithm. Even just life as we know it, all based on the DNA molecule, has invented an <em>astonishing</em> variety of different and complex ways of evolving. Bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals <em>use</em> DNA differently. They grow, behave, and reproduce in <em>completely</em> different ways. How many other ways might there be to do it? When we present evolution as a single, constant thing, we limit our imagination. Evolution evolves, and it takes as many diverse forms as it makes.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 3</h1>



<p>(The image for this week is an illustration from Waddington&#8217;s 1957 paper <em>The Strategy of the Genes</em>, which is often used to explain canalization. It shows a landscape with shallow, forking grooves and a ball rolling down that landscape. Although the ball&#8217;s path isn&#8217;t fully determined, the existing impressions in the landscape constrain it to one of a few likely paths)</p>



<p>This is part three of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">the beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Darwin explained part of the great mystery of life: how complexity and intelligence can evolve from randomness. When DNA was discovered, this seemed to “seal the deal.” DNA is the molecule that describes an organism’s nature, makes traits heritable, and carries mutations that are fodder for natural selection. That seemed to explain everything, at first, but I would argue that’s just the beginning. The DNA molecule itself lies at the heart of an incredibly complex system of processes that manage its care, use, and replication. These systems are collectively studied as “epigenetics,” and science is just beginning to understand how they work and the impact they have on evolution.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that DNA is an inert molecule that does nothing by itself. It needs a cell, a sort of organic micro-robot, to interpret that DNA and turn it into form and behavior. So, in a sense, every living thing is made up of <em>two</em> evolved programs: the DNA and the cell. Both are made of physical matter, which are subject to mutations. Both share the same selective pressures and reproductive fate. They evolve together, but they have different purposes. For the most part, the DNA program is what determines the organism’s lifestyle. The cell decides how to read that program, and how to make changes to that program over a lifetime and across generations.</p>



<p>One of the most important ways cells influence their own programming is through mutations. These happen naturally. As molecules bang against each other and get exposed to UV radiation from the sun, they sometimes spontaneously change shape. When those molecules represent critical information for a species’ survival, that could be disastrous. For this reason, life invests a <em>ton</em> of energy into detecting and correcting errors. But this process is never perfect, and it can’t be. If life always copied itself <em>perfectly</em>, there would be no variation for selection to act on, and no evolution. Not only that, getting the error rate much lower than it already is would be prohibitively expensive. So, life strikes a healthy balance, allowing just enough mutation to be useful, but not enough to be dangerous.</p>



<p>Interestingly, that finely-tuned mutation rate is not constant and universal. There are some stretches of DNA that get <em>extra</em> error correction, always triple checked to ensure they stay as stable as possible. On the other hand, some stretches of DNA get actively shuffled, injecting randomness into things like the immune system, creating diversity that makes the population as a whole more robust. Perhaps most remarkable is that when cells get stressed out, they divert energy to other things, and away from error correction. This may just be an accidental side effect of the cell breaking down, but it might also be a survival strategy. To anthropomorphize, perhaps cells get creative when times are tough, trying out crazy ideas in the desperate hope that one might save them.</p>



<p>That said, a single DNA copying error can be <em>devastating</em>, so how does life cope? Remarkably, it can often just work around the problem. Living systems have a lot of redundancy, with many mutually supportive ways of doing basically the same thing. This leads to a phenomenon called “canalization.” The more critical some behavior is to life, and the longer it persists over many generations, the more redundancy builds up around it. This means that single errors may alter the behavior a little, change how it works, or make it less efficient, but probably won’t break it entirely.</p>



<p>When errors are too severe to recover from, an organism might just fail to thrive and die, but sometimes it actually notices the failure and decides to self-terminate. That may seem bizarre, but in multicellular organisms it makes a lot of sense. If the error is in a single cell, then removing that cell lets others take over its job. If the error would prevent the whole embryo from developing into a healthy adult, then it’s better to scrap the work in progress, recycle those materials, and start over from scratch. In other words, life has its own Quality Assurance processes, at multiple levels, which minimize investment into evolutionary dead ends.</p>



<p>Cells can also swap genes with each other, sharing useful recipes and trying them out in new combinations. Sex is one way to do it, aligning and remixing two complete genomes in an incredibly complex way that ensures the resulting DNA program is still valid. Simpler organisms like bacteria don’t do this, but swap genes in a much more free-form process called “horizontal gene transfer.” Basically, cells sometimes leave scraps of DNA lying around, or pick up those scraps and integrate them into their own programming. This can let a new behavior (like resisting some toxin or eating some food) spread very rapidly through a bacterial colony. Either way, randomly adopting genes <em>that have proven successful in another organism</em> is a much safer and more powerful way to create useful diversity than mutation alone.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that how a cell reads its DNA can change over a lifetime. Cells annotate their program with notes (ie, methylation) that indicate which recipes to avoid or use more of, depending on context. This is how single celled organisms adapt their behavior to a changing environment, and how cells in multicellular organisms differentiate into different kinds of tissues. Importantly, these notes are sometimes passed down across generations. For instance, an organism might survive near starvation by tuning down its metabolism, staying smaller, slower, and using less energy. That change is <em>heritable</em>. The next few generations will <em>also</em> have a slower metabolism, and if that serves them well, it could lead to long-lasting behavioral changes that eventually get encoded into the DNA itself.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve talked about how life modifies itself, but it also modifies the environment. Organisms can build caches, nests, and tools that make life easier, and these get passed on, too, both as hand-me-downs and as lessons. Organisms form an ecosystem, full of mutualistic relationships between species that make life easier. Over geological time, this has transformed our planet from a barren rock to a lush world full of possibility. Life cultivates a supportive environment for future generations, shaping their behavior and evolutionary fitness. Child care might be the most visible example, protecting each new life when it’s most fragile, then sending off the new generation in a good direction informed by the parent’s life experience.</p>



<p>In the basic Darwinian story, evolution is something that <em>happens to</em> organisms. Accidental changes occur randomly, and nature chooses which ones will persist. But as we’ve just seen, life does <em>not</em> leave things up to chance. Randomness plays a key role in biological evolution, but life manages that randomness carefully and uses it selectively. Life also does everything in its power to influence the next generation, in ways that are <em>not</em> random, but “purposeful” in a sense. A cell can’t understand <em>why</em> it does these things, but it does them for a reason: they worked well in the past, got selected for, and ended up in the cell’s programming.</p>



<p>This leads to a powerful realization: when it comes to influencing evolution, cells don’t understand what they’re doing, but many higher organisms <em>do</em>, at least a little. For instance, an animal can apply its full cognitive capacity, mind and all, to choosing a mate and raising its offspring. In this way, the cell has moved from blindly repeating what worked in the past, to making evolutionarily relevant decisions <em>intentionally</em>, with forethought and analysis. A dog may not understand genetics or think about the future of her species, but she <em>certainly</em> has strong opinions about who would make a good mate, when / where / how to raise her puppies, and which pups to give more or less attention to. She uses her senses, her instincts, and her big brain to make big decisions that shape evolution. She may not see the big picture, but she cares and makes informed choices nonetheless.</p>



<p>This helps explain the paradox of how life managed to become <em>so incredibly smart</em> just by randomly banging molecules together for a few billion years. Life may have started off randomly, but it quickly became more directed. <strong>Life </strong><strong><em>harnessed</em></strong><strong> Darwinian evolution to build a more powerful evolutionary algorithm, one that’s </strong><strong><em>opinionated</em></strong><strong> and shapes its own search space.</strong> At first, these evolution-shaping behaviors were simple and rigid, just tricks repeated by rote because they tended to make the next generation more successful. Then, as life became more intelligent, it started to apply that intelligence to shaping itself, creating a runaway process of recursive self-improvement.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The main takeaway from all this is that Darwin is the <em>beginning</em> of the story of evolution, not the end. Life uses all of its intelligent capacity to influence its own evolution. This led to a virtuous cycle. Increased intelligence gave life greater influence over evolution, which it used to become more intelligent, which gave it greater influence over evolution. For this reason, I think <strong>it’s better to say that life designed itself than to say it evolved by chance</strong>. The process of “design” here was more stochastic, collective, and unthinking than we normally associate with that word, but in the end, the result is the same.</p>



<p>This story is still uncertain. The science around autonomous robots, intelligent collectives, and epigenetics is relatively new, and changing all the time. Plenty of biologists push back hard against the idea of any sort of agency or direction in evolution, partly because they’ve been fighting against the theory of Intelligent Design for so long. Others believe we’re overdue for a <a href="https://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com/about-the-ees/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20extended%20evolutionary,i.e.%2C%20the%20modern%20synthesis).">new story about evolution</a>, and are trying to find the right narrative and the evidence to back it up. I hope my research into evolutionary algorithms might be a useful contribution to that effort. If you’d like to dig deeper into this topic, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4526346279">Evolution in Four Dimensions</a> is an excellent overview of the field of epigenetics.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Cell’s Eye View of Evolution, Part 2</h3>



<p>(this month&#8217;s image is a photo I took at Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, California. It consists of millions of tiny pebbles of polished sea glass in myriad colors. Each one is improbable to find at a beach, but all of them collectively tell the story of a larger-scale process that explains their presence—many years of disposing of waste bottles nearby)</p>



<p>This is part two of a three-part series. You can read it on its own, but to get the whole story, you should start from the <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/08/02/a-cells-eye-view-of-evolution/">beginning</a>.</p>



<p>Every living cell is a universal automaton, capable of an infinite variety of forms and lifestyles. The cell itself determines the range of possibility—what proteins can it make, how will they integrate into the whole, and how will they shape the organism’s life? But within that space of possibility, the gene sequence is the program that determines what <em>specific</em> body to make, and how it should respond to a chaotic environment. That program is of the utmost importance, selecting one specialized lifestyle out of infinitely many possibilities, most of which would never work. But who wrote it?</p>



<p>Life did. Or, in other words, <em>cells</em> wrote the programming for cells, but it doesn’t seem fair to call them “programmers.” A human programmer is a top-down problem solver. To modify some working software, I start by analyzing that system’s performance: what does it do, and how well? I then try to understand how the system works. I read its programming, and consider how that leads to the behavior I observe. I consider how the system might be better, what specific improvements I might make, and what consequences I expect. I design a change to the code, then tinker with it in a sandbox environment until it does exactly what I want with no surprises or side effects. Only when I’m satisfied do I push the code out for use in the real world.</p>



<p>How are cells supposed to do that? They don’t have a mind like I do. They monitor their own health and situation, but they can’t imagine themselves “from the outside.” They don’t understand their lifestyle, their goals, or their relationships with the world except in terms of stimulus and response. They can execute short stretches of programming from their DNA, but they can’t examine the program as a whole, or imagine what would happen if they ran some other program instead. Mutations and cross-breeding cause the program to change, but cells can’t verify those changes in a safe testing environment. They can only make a new organism, release it into the world, and hope for the best.</p>



<p>This seems like a paradox, but only from the perspective of an individual cell. Life <em>never</em> exists as a lone individual. It always consists of diverse communities and ecosystems. So let’s take that perspective. Life isn’t a cell. Life is a <em>vast</em> collection of cells, an unimaginably huge number of concurrent individuals, living and dying continuously over billions of years. I like to think of it as a massively parallel computer. Life learns by accumulating and generalizing over the experiences of many lifetimes. It tries out many lifestyles simultaneously; whole different categories of lifestyles in different species and niches; many variations on a theme, among organisms of the same species. Whether any individual will be successful is hard to predict, because luck is such a huge factor. But by running the same experiments thousands of trillions of times over, life can get a relatively clear picture of what works and what doesn’t.</p>



<p>From this massively parallel perspective, each cell is a processor unit with two jobs. The first job is to live and reproduce. We normally think of that as “the purpose” of life, but from the collective perspective, it’s just the engine that keeps the system as a whole running. Individual lifetimes come and go rapidly and continuously like the cycles in a computer processor. The <em>second</em> job of each cell is <strong>to learn about the Universe and how to thrive in it, then integrate that information back into the system’s programming. That is life’s deeper purpose</strong>. Each cell has a very limited perspective and can only do this in a minimal way. But taken all together, vast numbers of cells can behave much more like a traditional programmer.</p>



<p>A cell has no understanding of what it does or how it fits into the big picture, but, in a sense, life as a whole <em>does</em>. Life consists of every cell, every lifestyle, every program that has worked so far, and all the dead ends that <em>aren’t</em> represented. That’s a tremendous amount of information about what the system does, which parts are performing better than others, and where there’s untapped potential. There’s no top-down designer, but this information, embodied in the population itself, still shapes the system’s evolution. Each cell acts selfishly, but by competing and collaborating with each other, life distributes resources to the parts of itself that are thriving in their niche, and encourages exploration of new lifestyles where opportunity lies.</p>



<p>The big difference between life and a human programmer is speculation. Humans <em>envision</em> the system as a whole and <em>imagine</em> where it might go. When I program a computer, I test ideas first in my mind and then in a virtual environment on the computer in order to avoid mistakes and dead ends. Life doesn’t do that, because its massively parallel, distributed design makes that impossible. There simply is no top-down view, no central authority to perceive and decide, no way to step out of the system for testing. Instead, life just tries everything. It tests code in production. It walks straight into failure rather than avoiding it. <strong>Death sorts what works from what doesn’t. That’s why we usually think of cells as “dumb” and humans as “smart.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>It would be better to think of humans as more efficient</strong>, because in a sense what we do isn’t so different. We both generate lots of options, test them, winnow them down to the most successful, and iterate. I do it with simulations in my brain, life does it with matter in the physical Universe. From a computational perspective, that doesn’t matter. A computer can be realized with cogs, transistors, neurons, or a simulation inside another computer. The materials can be anything so long as the <em>functionality</em> is the same. As individual living animals, it seems tragic and absurd that life must test out ideas by letting things die on a massive scale. From life’s perspective, though, a single lifetime is just a brief use of materials and programming that will get recycled for future experiments. If it were conscious, life as a collective whole wouldn’t regret (or notice!) the death of an organism any more than we regret the death of one of our cells.</p>



<p>You might argue that the human programmer also has <em>foresight</em>. I don’t just try stuff at random, I have a sense of what might work and what probably won’t. I use trial and error, but I <em>prioritize</em> and focus my exploration. It’s tempting to say cells <em>don’t</em> do this, but that’s too dismissive. Cells are quite opinionated. DNA doesn’t contain a blueprint for an organism, but a bunch of recipes that the cell can choose between depending on context. Cells must decide how to act. Evolution has equipped them with a wide variety of strategies and tools, and guidance on when to use them, all encoded in the DNA. This is how life learns from experience, plans ahead, and avoids dead ends. Life explores new paths at random, but it mostly tries out reasonable variations of known working strategies.</p>



<p>Individual cells aren’t much like human programmers, but they do have one thing in common: they write code. Mostly, the cell just copies its own DNA (copy / paste is a popular strategy among human programmers, too), but it makes an important decision: what variations to try in the next generation. This happens either through mutations, or by swapping genetic material with other cells. Without a top-down view of the gene sequence, this can only be a random process. The cell has no idea what changes it’s introducing, or what the consequences might be, but it <em>can</em> try to shape that randomness for the better. Primarily, this means spending a <em>ton</em> of time and energy on error correction, so that only a small number of mutations get through. It also shows up in things like mate selection, genetic recombination, and preparing the environment for the next generation.</p>



<p>I like to think of Darwin’s story as how life got started. Random mutation and selection are all you need to evolve better forms. As we learn more about cells, though, we see there’s a lot more going on. Life didn’t just find better lifestyles, it invented a general purpose platform capable of an infinite variety of lifestyles. As a collective, life uses that platform to explore many lifestyles simultaneously, pruning dead ends and investing more resources into exploring evolutionary paths that seem fruitful. Life started out randomly, but it grew more opinionated over time, and it has evolved many sophisticated ways to direct and shape its own evolution. That will be the topic of my next post.</p>



<p>What do you think? Did reading this make you think of life, cells, or evolution any differently? Any new ideas? Does anything I said sound wrong or misleading? Do you have other ways of looking at it? This post is more speculative than usual, and represents some of the ideas I hope to pursue in my PhD research, so I’m very interested in criticism and feedback. If you have any thoughts, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>These days, the Artificial Intelligence community is pretty fixated on Deep Learning, a software tool inspired by the human brain. It’s popular because it’s successful. Deep Learning technology has driven incredible advances in natural language processing, image perception / generation, and game playing (not to mention ad targeting, feed ranking, and surveillance). That success was partly driven by luck. It turns out, even a fairly simple DL algorithm, given <em>enormous</em> amounts of data and computational power, can do pretty remarkable things. Other attempts at reproducing intelligent behavior haven’t been so successful, and are relatively neglected for that reason. That’s a shame, because I believe there are big opportunities in areas where we aren’t looking, they&#8217;re just a little more difficult to uncover.</p>



<p>Recently, I’ve taken particular interest in Genetic Algorithms. Put very simply, these are computer programs which use the principle of “survival of the fittest” at their core. They’ve been a popular topic of research since the 1960’s. Since then, they’ve found moderate success and have become standard kit for solving certain kinds of computational problems. Unfortunately, the fundamental design principles for GAs haven’t changed much since the 70’s, despite the fact that our understanding of evolution and our computing hardware have improved <em>dramatically</em> since then. I think today’s GAs are a shadow of what they could be, and I have ideas for how to unlock that potential.</p>



<p>But first, let’s establish what a traditional Genetic Algorithm is. Like Deep Learning, GAs are a tool for training a computer to do a task without explicitly telling it how to do the work step by step. There’s one big difference, though. DL is good at replicating what a human being would do, but to learn that it needs hundreds (or better yet, <em>millions</em>) of examples to study and imitate. So, it’s mostly good for automating work that people already do routinely. In contrast, GAs don’t need any example data. They’re good at solving problems where we <em>don’t</em> know the best solution or how to find it, just so long as we can recognize a good answer when we see it. The main challenge is framing the problem in such a way that the GA can learn to solve it.</p>



<p>Genetic Algorithms are often used when the space of possible answers is so big it would be impossible to try them all, or even to explore them in a systematic way. Instead, a GA depends on randomness. It starts by just guessing a bunch of solutions. Most of these will be garbage, so they get thrown out right away. The ones that are slightly better than complete garbage become the starting point for the next iteration. The algorithm makes more possible solutions by mixing the best previous solutions together and sprinkling in some extra randomness for variety. By sheer luck, some of those solutions may be better than the previous ones, and the process repeats. This simple method can be surprisingly effective, gradually transforming garbage into gold. But it depends a lot on giving the algorithm the right pieces to start with such that randomly mashing them together might actually work.</p>



<p>Natural selection is a kind of design process. Like human designers do, nature gets inspiration from random sources, tests ideas against harsh reality, and iterates to discover and build highly functional objects. Genetic Algorithms are basically an automated version of that process, so they’re frequently used as design tools. For instance, modern Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) software for architecture and industrial design often use GAs. A human designer specifies some constraints (how big an object can be, how much weight it must hold, etc.) and fitness goals (minimize weight and material costs, but maximize tensile strength), then the software automatically finds good solutions. Recently, there’s also been a great deal of interest in using GAs to design effective architectures for Deep Learning systems.</p>



<p>So, that’s Genetic Algorithms in a nutshell. Why do I feel there&#8217;s unrealized potential here? What do I want to do differently? There are several insights from modern evolutionary theory that I want to apply to GAs. Generally speaking, though, it’s all about what work is done by the programmer vs. what is left up to evolution. A GA uses a “gene sequence” (usually just a string of digits) to represent each of its attempted solutions. A gene sequence can either be a solution in itself, or a program that generates the solution. Traditionally, what the gene sequence means and how to derive an answer from it is entirely up to the programmer. This is very different from nature, where life evolved the language of genetics and species-specific genomes along with all the organisms built using those tools.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the search process itself. In a traditional Genetic Algorithm, the programmer takes great care to tune the rate of mutation and the process of recombining genes from multiple individuals. They often hand design “custom mutations” that are more clever than just randomly changing digits in the gene sequence. They use their knowledge and intuition to avoid testing obviously bad gene sequences, to make changes that seem useful, and to preserve good patterns in the gene sequence that might otherwise get clobbered or broken up. This can help enormously, but it&#8217;s a lot of hard work for the programmer. The science of epigenetics shows that nature uses many of the same tricks, but it discovered them through natural selection, without any human guidance.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, life has an element of self-determination. Life designs itself, and optimizes the search process for better designs, using evolution by natural selection as its tool. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to imagine life as a passive product of evolution, like traditional Genetic Algorithms do. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to leave the hardest parts of GA development to a human being. Not only does that make human creativity a limiting factor, it means we aren&#8217;t studying or reproducing the most remarkable thing about natural evolution.</p>



<p>I hope this perspective will be valuable. One of the biggest shortcomings of Genetic Algorithms so far is that they aren&#8217;t nearly as open-ended or creative as life itself. Very rarely do they exhibit the sort of accumulated layers of complexity and sophistication that are the hallmark of natural intelligence. Perhaps that will change, if we can hand over more of the creative work to the GA? Perhaps a new paradigm in GA designs could make them applicable to new kinds of problems, or produce more clever solutions? I&#8217;m working on a prototype that I hope will demonstrate that potential.</p>



<p>The main drawback of my approach is that evolving the design for a Genetic Algorithm takes <em>way</em> more time and computing power than just running a GA designed the old fashioned way. I’m not too worried about that, though. I’m using the same parallel processing hardware that has become ubiquitous for Deep Learning applications to make my code efficient and scalable. My hope is that this new approach to GAs will make it possible to improve their performance by just throwing more computational power at the problem, like we already do so successfully with DL. This would also make GAs less cumbersome, by replacing expert design and hand-tuning with automation.</p>



<p>There’s lots more beyond this that I hope to explore in time. For instance, life evolves whole ecosystems and environments where organisms collaborate and support each other, producing intelligence, robustness, and efficiency far greater than the sum of its parts. By comparison, many Genetic Algorithms work on single individuals that exist in total isolation. Then there’s the way life evolves layer upon layer of emergent complexity, building communities out of brains, bodies, cells, and proteins. I’m excited to build multi-layered intelligent systems, and especially to try combining evolved programs and neural networks in a biologically realistic way.</p>



<p>Turns out, there’s much more to AI than Deep Learning. I’m pretty excited by the untapped potential of Genetic Algorithms, but that’s just me. Are there other areas of AI research that interest you? Can you think of more examples of natural intelligence that computers can’t seem to replicate? I’d love to hear from you in the comments. This post is also a preview of my research. I hope to share my first prototype by the end of the year. So, stay tuned for more on that.</p>
