<p>(This month’s image is a slime mold growing on a log. It grows in a branching network of banana-yellow tendrils, some of which are engulfing plant debris they encountered. <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/slime-molds-capable-passing-learned-behaviors-new-cell-populations/">Source</a>)</p>



<p>Later this month, I’ll be attending the <a href="https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/HomePage">Genetic and Evolutionary Computing Conference</a> (GECCO) in Melbourne, Australia. I’m super excited to go, and to present my very first published academic paper as a poster. I’ll share more here when all is said and done, but unfortunately my paper isn’t really intended for a general audience, like this blog. It would probably be hard to understand for anyone outside of the fields of AI or ALife. So, for everybody else, I’d like to share what the paper means to me, and what I’m trying to say by publishing it.</p>



<p>My research is inspired by epigenetics, and new ways of thinking about evolution. I saw that life doesn’t just evolve by chance, it evolves to become more evolvable. It learns how to explore the range of possible forms and lifestyles more efficiently, and to nudge evolution down more fruitful paths. Life uses its intelligence to become more intelligent still. In my mind, this changes <em>everything</em> about evolution, and I was shocked it wasn’t more well known. Most discussions of evolution (and the programmer version: evolutionary computation, or EC) are too simple, and ignore these critical details. So, I figured I’d be the one to bring this up, and show people why it matters.</p>



<p>I started my first experiment before I even got to university. I was so excited by the idea, I just had to get it out of my head. I actually avoided looking for prior work, because I wanted to see how <em>I</em> would manifest this idea without being biased by other people’s thinking. Besides, I didn’t know of any research like mine, and I didn’t know how to find it, either. That’s why I applied to UVM. When I got here, my advisor and lab mates encouraged me to publish this project, and pointed me at the relevant literature. So I hit the books, reading all that had been done before in order to put my own work into context.</p>



<p>And, of course, I found I’m not the first to have this idea. There are many variations of EC inspired by biology, looking for the “secret sauce” that makes life more powerful than our computer models. In particular, how life evolves to be more evolvable is an active area of research, which has been building momentum in recent years. At first, I was disappointed. My idea was already taken! So much of what I thought made my project interesting had been tried before in some other context. But not exactly. Identifying those subtle differences has been tremendously helpful.</p>



<p>You see, it’s pretty well established now that “evolvability” is important. In our experiments, simulated life that’s more evolvable finds fitter solutions faster. It’s better at adapting to changing circumstances, too. It seems to be smarter and more creative. I find this exhilarating, yet these discoveries didn’t “change everything” like I had hoped. In the experiments so far, it feels like an incremental improvement. It helps, but not enough to draw much attention away from other areas of AI research, like deep learning, which is seen as much more powerful and more productive.</p>



<p>I think that’s because we still haven’t broken out of our old ways of thinking. Traditional EC is all about finding good solutions to a problem, but I would argue that evolution isn’t about problem solving. It’s about problem <em>finding</em>. Life explores the space of possible lifestyles to find and exploit <em>opportunities</em>. The evolution of life is a bit like a slime mold. It grows simultaneously in all directions, questing around obstacles to find resources, reinforcing the branches that get lucky, culling back the ones that don’t. It doesn’t have a top-down view of the world, but it’s still <em>strategic</em> and <em>adaptive</em>. When I look at most of the existing experiments in this space, I feel like we’re putting a slime mold into a narrow tunnel and measuring how fast it can get to the other end. We’re accidentally putting evolution in a straight jacket, and blinding ourselves to what makes it so interesting and powerful.</p>



<p>So, in my first experiment, I try to show a different perspective. I made a single algorithm that can adapt itself to solve many <em>different</em> tasks. Normally, an EC programmer picks one task to solve, then designs an evolutionary search strategy to suit that problem. They invent a genome language, a way of turning that into a solution, and ways of randomly tweaking the genome that might lead to better solutions. In my experiment, I evolved the search strategy, too. As the programmer, I designed a vast and open ended search domain, and many ways that the algorithm could restrict that space. But I wasn’t sure which restricted sub-spaces would work best, and, unlike traditional EC, I didn’t try to guess. I just let the algorithm figure that out for itself.</p>



<p>The way I did this is also interesting. It turns out, the algorithm I invented is strikingly similar to one that’s already popular: “compositional pattern-producing networks,” or CPPNs. Again, it was a little frustrating to be scooped, but I’m using this algorithm in a new way. Instead of evolving new “bodies” for simulated life, I’m evolving new <em>ways of generating</em> bodies. It’s a subtle difference, but an important one, I think. That extra level of indirection gives evolution more influence over its destiny, and the power to make more complex patterns in ways I couldn’t even anticipate. Now that I know how my idea is so similar to, yet different from, an existing algorithm, I’m teasing apart those differences, to measure the impact of each one.</p>



<p>I’m proud of my work, and excited to talk about it with other EC enthusiasts at GECCO. On the other hand, I’m still figuring out how to do science, and there’s a lot I <em>don’t</em> like about my first paper. This project was mostly my way of proving to myself that this crazy idea could work. The results are intriguing, but it’s not yet a clear example of what I want to show. It’s also complicated, unusual, and hard to explain, even to other EC researchers. If I want people to get excited about this, I need to simplify, make my work more relatable, and find better ways to demonstrate and measure the novel behavior I’m talking about here. There are no “obstacle courses for slime molds” in the EC literature that I know of, so perhaps I’ll need to design some.</p>



<p>Hopefully, I’ll get lots of inspiration and feedback at GECCO. As I learn more about the field of EC, I’m finding more and more examples of work similar, yet slightly different, from my own. This is great, because each of those differences is an opportunity for a new experiment, to see if my perspective can shed light on something new. I’m already dreaming up all sorts of new ways to explore my ideas. And that’s more or less how I hope to spend the next several years. Maybe <em>that’s</em> my PhD.</p>



<p>In any case, I hope that explanation was interesting, and not too vague. I’ll get more specific in a few weeks, when I post a follow up with the full GECCO paper, the poster I presented, a video summary of that poster, and links to some supplemental results and analysis. I bet I’ll have some fun things to report from my time in Melbourne, too! As always, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello there, reader. I hope you’ve been enjoying the blog. It’s been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That’s going great, but it’s keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.</p>



<p>So far, I’ve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don’t think I can keep up that pace. I’ve got a few finished posts queued up, but I’ve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every <em>three</em> months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We’ll see!</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I’d share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I’m about two thirds of the way through my first semester.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It’s electrifying. I don’t know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I’m often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they’re pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I’m reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I’m integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I’m learning isn’t radically new or different, but I’m fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on research yet, but I&#8217;m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others’, and vice versa. It’s helping see new angles and new possibilities. I’m talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I’d like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I&#8217;m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It’s forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others’ ideas.</p>



<p>This is exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve been on my own since leaving Google, and the experience is just underscoring something I know to be true: human minds aren’t meant to work alone. We&#8217;re social creatures, and most of us just cannot reach our full capacity in isolation. At UVM, my mind is constantly stimulated, and I’m always challenged to stretch myself, try new ideas, and make new contributions. I feel I can go much further here, and accomplish great things. Of course, the flip side is that it’s <em>exhausting</em>, especially while I’m still new and figuring out how things work here. The pace of activity is very fast, and there’s much more to read, do, and learn than I could possibly fit into a day.</p>



<p>In some sense, that’s already very familiar. My experience at Google (especially near the end, when I was leading teams) was also a fast paced, continuous, information overload. The key skills for dealing with that are prioritization and time management. I just have to pick what to spend my time on, and let everything else pass me by with minimal interference. Thankfully, I’ve gotten really good at that.</p>



<p>Still, I’m definitely feeling challenged right now, and so busy I barely have time to breathe. There are a few reasons for that. One is just that the pace of life was so much gentler over the past couple of years as I made this transition. I was working very hard, but my work was self-paced and I had very little external pressure. I took my time. Nobody was depending on me, or judging my performance. So, I’m having the jarring experience of suddenly stepping onto a moving treadmill. Only now, after a few months of settling in, have I found a good rhythm where I can keep up with all my work, have a life, and also pursue my own research goals.</p>



<p>This is also hard because I’m running on a very different sort of treadmill than what I experienced at Google. In a sense, it’s easier. I have a ton of work to do, but it’s mostly low-stakes reading, writing, and coding at a steady pace. As a manager at Google, my work was mostly decisions, strategy, and people issues. I spent a lot of time moving from crisis to crisis. I had to act quickly and decisively with limited information. My decisions would have a big, often irreversible impact on people’s lives (sometimes individuals I knew and cared about, and sometimes millions of strangers). I was accountable for those human consequences. That’s stressful! By comparison, grad school work is fun and low pressure.</p>



<p>In another sense, Google was actually much easier than academia, because it was highly structured. There, everyone had a well defined job role with explicit expectations. We had official priorities and ways of doing things that everyone adhered to. Everyone was organized into teams, which served complementary purposes and fit into a coherent whole. Leaders held meetings with regular cadences every week, month, quarter, etc., checking in on progress and aligning people on their mission, values, goals, and priorities. We never lived up to the ideal, but Google felt a bit like a clockwork mechanism. We all had a function, individually and collectively, and we worked together in lock-step to make it happen.</p>



<p>Academia and science are <em>far</em> less structured. Every PhD, every lab, every department, and every school do things differently. There are very few hard constraints, and anything that fits within them is valid. In grad school, lectures and assignments feel a bit more like “recommended work,” and you&#8217;re expected to invest only as much into them as makes sense for your needs. This is freeing, but also in some sense very frustrating. There are no best practices. Nobody can tell me what to do, or how to succeed. There’s very little indication of how I’m doing, or what progress I’m making. Everyone’s working more or less independently, on only sorta related projects, within a vaguely defined scope, based on their own judgment. There’s little sharing, few standards, and plenty of waste.</p>



<p>That said, science <em>should</em> be less structured than engineering. It <em>must</em> be. The university is designed this way to encourage diverse ways of thinking and of approaching problems. The challenge of science is that we don’t know what we don’t know. We don’t know what to look for, where to look, or how we&#8217;ll find it. Very often important truths are hidden behind common ideas and practices that everyone “knows” to be right, even though they are blatantly wrong! It’s important that students can follow in the footsteps of great thinkers and flesh out their works, but also that they can go in completely new directions and find what was overlooked. The chaos and freedom can be challenging, but it’s a necessary ingredient for innovation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Well, that’s what’s going on with me. I hope my thoughts on grad student life are interesting. I will start experimenting with the format of this blog and see where it goes. If you have any thoughts or suggestions about that, please let me know! If you’d like to stay more up to date on what I’m doing and thinking, I’m most active on Mastodon. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s basically a smaller, nerdier version of Twitter that isn&#8217;t owned by an alt-right friendly oligarch, and with much healthier communication norms and moderation practices. I post there pretty often, and I respond to most comments / DMs. You can find my profile <a href="http://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Photo is a shot I took of downtown Burlington, VT at twilight with lights in the trees and a clock tower in the background)</p>



<p>A year and a half ago, I took a big risk by leaving my comfortable career in the tech industry to pursue a graduate degree. Like many people, recent events inspired me to find more meaningful work, but it&#8217;s an intimidating change. How do you even do that? I have ideas I want to pursue, but they&#8217;re not exactly mainstream, and grad school is competitive. I didn’t know where to start, but I decided to try. I pushed my way through, and I&#8217;m very happy with <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2023/04/06/back-to-school/">the results</a>. I don’t claim to have a secret recipe for career change, but I want to share my experience in case it’s helpful for you or someone you know.</p>



<p>My first challenge was realizing: I have no idea what grad school is even like. Most universities have two parallel programs: they provide a baseline education to the masses for a profit, and then they actually do science and train scientists. Generally speaking, the only thing these have in common is the college where they happen. I got my baseline undergraduate education at Brown, but that didn’t teach me anything about grad school. While I was on campus, I had the <em>opportunity</em> to learn about grad school, but I wasn’t interested then, so I let that chance pass me by.</p>



<p>Many years later, I tried to learn what grad school is and how to succeed there by talking to students and professors. This was surprisingly painful. In general, folks did a poor job explaining what grad school is like, and gave me all sorts of conflicting advice. Gradually, I began to see two big reasons why:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>. There’s no one “grad school experience.” Every school, discipline, program, and lab is different. They have their own jargon, priorities, and expectations. Yet, when asking someone about it, they will describe their experience as typical, and give specific advice that would have helped them. The best way to get a sense of what&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; is to talk to lots of folks and pay careful attention to where they <em>disagree</em>. Conflicting advice helped me understand the full range of programs out there.</li>



<li><strong>Immersion</strong>. Grad school is an immersive experience. I expect I’ll show up on campus, get swept up in things, and gradually discover I’m “being a grad student” without ever being taught how. This sort of experiential learning is fast and effective, but it’s hard to explain. People just don’t have the words. They shared lots of details, but without context those mostly went over my head. They didn&#8217;t mention the “obvious stuff,” because it&#8217;s intuitive for them, and I didn&#8217;t know to ask about it. To learn the fundamentals, I had to <em>read between the lines</em>. When something didn&#8217;t add up, I&#8217;d look for hidden assumptions that could explain the reasoning. Cross referencing multiple conversations was important.</li>
</ol>



<p>The next challenge was finding the right place for me. At a high level, academia is divided into disciplines, like Physics, Biology, or Computer Science, and each of those has many sub-disciplines nested within. Each one is working on a certain set of problems using certain tools and methods. Many grad students start with no clear idea of what they’ll do. They just pick a discipline, learn about it, and find a way to make themselves useful. My situation is different: I have specific ideas I want to pursue. Unfortunately, scientists aren’t very interested in cool ideas from outsiders, unless they happen to fit within their field of research.</p>



<p>It took me a long time to figure out what discipline to join. It seems like it should be obvious, but many research questions like mine are <em>interdisciplinary</em>, and don&#8217;t fit the usual options. Ultimately, it came down to what <em>tools</em> I wanted to use. Even though my ideas are about life, self-making, and meaning, I want to study these phenomena <em>as algorithms</em>, analyze their behavior, and recreate them in a computer. This led me to focus on Computer Science, and the sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. I’m ambitious and experienced, so naturally I thought I’d apply to the top schools for CS and AI. That was a mistake.</p>



<p>The problem is,the big-name schools are mainstream by definition, and my research is not. I’m actually quite concerned that the field has lost its way. They have too narrow a definition for “intelligence,” and tend to worry more about new consumer technology than understanding nature. But the big schools are the ones <em>setting</em> this agenda. Their programs are highly competitive, and they’re looking for people who will advance their goals. Even if I somehow managed to get in, they would not provide a supportive environment for me as a student.</p>



<p>If not the big name schools, then where? There are many options, covering an <em>enormous</em> range. How do I find the right one? The promotional materials online are quite generic and unhelpful, so again I turned to people. I cold emailed professors doing vaguely related work, and maybe one in five replied. At first, they barely understood what I was talking about or what to suggest, but usually they could point me at someone slightly more relevant than themselves. That way, I gradually worked my way to folks who “got it.” This led me to a totally new list of schools to apply to. It took nearly a full year, and I wish I had longer.</p>



<p>Figuring out where I fit in was also about looking inwards. I had ideas, but they were vague and complex. To talk to people, I had to explain myself in ways they could understand. That was hard, but useful. It forced me to consolidate my ideas, disentangle them, and look at them from many angles. I wrote it all down, which was important. Most professors don’t have time for extra reading, but the writing process helped me organize my thoughts, making them much easier to talk about. Some of that writing even ended up on this blog.</p>



<p>I also did a lot of reading, which was invaluable. I read books and journal articles covering a wide swath <em>around</em> my ideas in different fields. This let me survey the kinds of work people were actually doing, and imagine myself in their shoes. I was surprised by how many ideas excited me in theory, but sounded like a drag in practice. I also learned about the jargon, ideas, and thinkers in this space. That made it much easier to talk to professors, helped me find new leads, and gave me new tools for my research.</p>



<p>What are my big takeaways from all of this? Grad school is a bit of a catch-22. It’s a big, complex, and opaque institution. It’s hard to learn about it without being a part of it. It’s hard to get accepted or be successful without knowing the field, the professors, the incentive structures—in other words, being an insider already. Luckily, it’s possible to pick up this knowledge. It’s just a difficult and time-consuming process, and it helps to have connections. Most professors don’t have time for outsiders, but some are eager to help, <em>especially</em> for ideas near and dear to their hearts. Once I finally found folks who shared my interests, they welcomed me with open arms.</p>



<p>So that’s my journey, what I did, what I learned, and how it went. Now I’d love to hear from you. Does any of this surprise you, or resonate with your own experience? Do you have any questions about getting into higher education, or advice for others just getting started? Any thoughts on the state of academia generally? Join the conversation in the comments! It’s my favorite part of this blog, so don’t miss out.</p>

<p>This blog is about two things: me, and the ideas I’m passionate about. I’ll talk more about those ideas in the next post, but first I think I should introduce myself. I’m a 37 year old man. I live in suburban California with my wife and cat. My hobbies include hiking, cooking, and yoga. Until recently, I worked as a software engineer at Google, which was a pretty sweet gig. Then I decided to quit to pursue “intelligence research,” of all things. I think this was a big surprise to most of my friends, family, and coworkers, but looking back at my life, it almost feels inevitable to me. This is the culmination of many influences, over many years.</p>



<p>For one thing, I’ve always had a very deep interest in science. My parents were both highly educated and eager to teach me everything they could. My dad was a professor doing research in cell biology and the hormones that mediate human behavior. My mom was a vet technician, helping care for cats, dogs, and horses in a clinical setting. They taught me all about bodies and how they work, at both the micro and macro level. As a kid, dinner conversation might center on the latest veterinary medical mystery, or recent discoveries in genomics. When I was young, I started to devour books, shows, and movies about science fact and science fiction, and I never stopped. I’ve taken college classes and watched lecture series. My favorite topics have always been life, evolution, the mind, culture, and artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>So, I’m a life-long science enthusiast, with broad but sometimes shallow knowledge in biology and the behavioral sciences. To be clear I am <em>not</em> an authority on these topics—yet. That’s a big reason why I see academia as my next step. I want to verify what I think I know, find the primary sources, and learn to talk about these ideas with rigor and precision. That said, I don’t think you need formal training to have a good idea. Before I made the dramatic move of quitting my cushy job, I spent a lot of time convincing myself that I’m onto something real and exciting, even if it’s still a little fuzzy.</p>



<p>On the other hand, I <em>am</em> a trained authority on algorithms and complex software systems. I’ve been programming since I was 12, got a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science from Brown University in 2007, and in my 14 years at Google I worked my way up from junior engineer to trusted elder. All my life, I’ve wondered how life is like a computer. For most of that time, I struggled to get the ideas to line up at all. Living systems are <em>profoundly</em> different from computers the way we build them today. It’s taken decades of hands-on experience with natural intelligence and software systems for me to gradually see the similarities, and understand the limits of what that analogy can tell us.</p>



<p>I’ve always had a close relationship with nature and animals. I was raised on a working farm, with a few dozen different animals from horses to chickens to cats. I fed them, medicated them, and scooped their poop. I knew each animal’s name, but also their unique personality, preferences, and relationships. I learned the limits of their understanding and how to communicate with them (to the extent possible). I learned never to turn my back on a donkey. Most importantly, I learned that animals have rich inner lives, and I got to see first hand how similar and different those experiences can be from individual to individual, and from species to species.</p>



<p>My interest in human culture has been just as enduring. As a philosophical, progressive boy transplanted from New York to a down-to-earth, conservative town in rural Virginia, I simply didn’t fit in. I was bullied. Kicked. Called a f*ggot. A dear friend once told me with earnest compassion that I was going to hell, simply because I was raised Jewish. I was so confused. I struggled to understand who I was, what society expected of me, and where those ideas even came from in the first place. Why did I understand the world so differently from the folks around me, who mostly seemed smart, caring, and reasonable? Why couldn’t we even <em>talk</em> about certain topics without starting an argument? I became obsessed with such questions, and have pondered them ever since.</p>



<p>At Google, I got to learn about intentionally designed culture. I led teams, which meant building a personal relationship with each individual, and learning their strengths, weaknesses, and motivations. I would set a vision that everyone could rally behind, then tell a continually evolving story about our project and how we each fit into the grand plan. I used goals, metrics, meetings, reviews, and continuing education to optimize our performance. I cultivated inclusion, psychological safety, and a growth mindset. Or, at least, I tried to. One of the first things you learn as a leader is that you cannot “control” your team. A team is defined by its culture, which evolves organically and collaboratively. Each individual has only limited influence over the direction of the whole. It’s a fascinating dynamic, and it’s a miracle how well it works.</p>



<p>What fascinated me most about being a manager was the dual nature of the job. On one hand, a team is a very human thing. Personal, emotional, creative, unpredictable. It’s about caring for individuals and helping them do their best work. On the other hand, a team is a machine. It’s an algorithm, designed to solve a particular problem, implemented with people. Bigger and more complex problems require bigger and more complex teams, with well-defined sub-problems, zones of responsibility, and interfaces between adjacent teams. An org chart is a catalog of interpersonal relationships <em>and</em> it’s a system architecture diagram for a company, at the same time. I think this realization was the key that led me to see the messy organic systems of life as something compatible with the language of algorithms.</p>



<p>So, you see, I’ve touched on these themes over and over again throughout my life, building them up, tying them together, and seeing them from new perspectives. I’ve educated myself, sought out relevant experience, and chased my passions. I’ve reinvented myself repeatedly, circling in on a lifestyle where I can thrive and truly be myself. This next step is a big one, but it’s part of a very natural progression. Finally, I have the knowledge, skills, stability, and self-confidence to do this.</p>
