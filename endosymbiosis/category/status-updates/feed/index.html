<p>Well, the third semester of my PhD is wrapping up! I really enjoyed my classes this time around. Evolutionary Computation was super interesting, and sparked all sorts of connections with my research. My class project was a big success, and I hope to turn it into a conference paper. I‚Äôll share more on that later, but here‚Äôs a <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn/113544231802797345">sneak peek</a> if you‚Äôre curious. Deep Learning was also pretty great, and I feel like I have a more deep and intuitive understanding of what‚Äôs actually going on when you train or interact with an AI. One of the more exciting / challenging topics we covered was Transformers, the new model architecture that powers ChatGPT and its ilk. In some sense, Transformers are quite simple, but they‚Äôre definitely not intuitive; understanding why they‚Äôre built the way they are, and why that works so well takes some effort. So, to help cement my understanding, I wrote a blog post about it, and you get a bonus episode for the holidays!</p>



<p>Over winter break I hope to develop my Evolutionary Computation class project into a full paper. In short, it&#8217;s a new kind of evolutionary algorithm, inspired by endosymbiosis, that works in surprising ways. So far I‚Äôve only used it to solve a trivial toy problem, so I‚Äôll probably also start work on a follow-up study, exploring what practical applications this new algorithm might be good for. And, of course, I‚Äôve got more research ideas to explore beyond that. I‚Äôm quite excited to try evolving a population without genomes, for instance. So many ideas! I hope I‚Äôll be able to keep a few projects running in parallel, balancing my time across them, and leaving room for me in between. I‚Äôll continue to share updates as I make progress.</p>



<p>In the spring, I‚Äôll delve even deeper into Deep Learning, with a class that explores counter-intuitive results and how surprisingly effective DL is sometimes. How is it even possible to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù using nothing but vector math? What are these models really doing, and why are some models better than others? Should be fun. I‚Äôll also be delving into the math of chaos and fractals. I hope that will be useful for my research into self-modifying dynamic systems (ie, simulated life <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="üòõ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), and lead to some very pretty visuals I can share. We‚Äôll see!</p>



<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll share the post about Transformers right after this, and that will wrap up another year of blog posts. More to come in January!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I‚Äôm at an interesting moment in my studies, so I thought I‚Äôd let you know what‚Äôs going on!</p>



<p>Year two of my PhD program has begun. I‚Äôm about a month into my third semester, and things are going well. I‚Äôm taking two classes right now: Evolutionary Computation, and Deep Learning. Most of my Computer Science education has been about how to design algorithms and write software to solve different kinds of problems, but these classes are different. This semester, I‚Äôm learning how to get computers to discover their own algorithms, and write their own software. Honestly, the state of the art here is still quite primitive. We‚Äôve found some very impressive techniques, but they each apply to a narrow domain, and we don‚Äôt understand them nearly as well as we‚Äôd like. Which makes them fun topics to study. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The other fun thing about this semester is that both of my classes are built around student projects. More or less, I get to pick projects that fit with my research, and the class is there to help me find the time, resources, and guidance to complete the projects successfully. I like this much better than undergraduate style courses built around assignments and exams that are very generic and may not be relevant to my work. We‚Äôll see how things unfold, but I‚Äôm currently planning to work on two projects that I‚Äôm excited about.</p>



<p>For Evolutionary Computation, I‚Äôm working on an experiment about endosymbiosis. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE">this classic experiment</a>, which examined how bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, and how genetic innovations spread through the population spatially. I‚Äôm going to try evolving a host environment that supports an inner population, a bit like how my gut supports a microbiome. The hope is that the host will be able to design a supportive environment, with different regions that cultivate ‚Äúmicrobes‚Äù with different traits, such that it can guide and coax them into evolving more specialized forms. This is an exciting experiment for me, because I‚Äôm not sure what to expect, but I‚Äôm pretty confident that <em>something</em> interesting will happen.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdXXQwS7goi1ItbTdONUzbfEiFKBIKils0XIfkXZl1xwzGxuTrV76lD5OFiNLNtXdXMpPz_do1AW3qdFEFbe4loZzIcjVBTtC7ciQbwbYhN1TQMr3tf_AuT-skSA-X_9lOauzGL31dv3Lj7hQqRBu0stv8?key=F266DdYKyjrziMBoqIpF8A" alt="A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred."></p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">A screenshot from the video linked above, showing strains of bacteria gradually growing into bands with increasing concentrations of antibiotic, fanning out from points where key mutations occurred.</p>



<p>For Deep Learning, I‚Äôm going to use computer vision techniques to detect interesting patterns in the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/">Game of Life</a>, since I‚Äôve been using that as an environment for my evolution experiments. The Game of Life has very simple rules, but it evolves in complex ways. Most patterns quickly dissolve into empty space or settle into a few boring, stable forms. But rarely, you get something much more interesting. For decades, people have been exploring this space, finding interesting patterns and classifying them. You get huge complex structures that stabilize themselves, change continuously in repeating cycles, or even propel themselves and move at a steady pace. I‚Äôll build a system that can detect and categorize these patterns, so that when my evolutionary algorithm finds them, I can reward it and ask for ‚Äúmore like that.‚Äù</p>

<p>This month‚Äôs essay is inspired by my Evolutionary Computation class, and the work I‚Äôve been doing to develop the specific research questions I want to focus on for my PhD. So, check back on Wednesday to learn more about how evolution got started, and why it‚Äôs worth asking: how does evolution evolve?</p>

<p>(I took this post‚Äôs photo at the Star Trek Original Series Set Tour in Ticonderoga, New York. It‚Äôs a view of the warp core of the USS Enterprise, which is only a few feet deep but looks much larger thanks to forced perspective. The room is filled with structures with complicated geometric shapes, technical looking panels, and dramatic lighting in red, blue, and purple.)</p>



<p>In my last post, I wrote about my latest research project and why I was so excited to present it at GECCO, the premier conference for evolutionary computation. I promised a follow-up, and here it is! Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt make it to Melbourne. Instead, I had a very complicated and protracted battle with my University‚Äôs travel planning system, United Airlines, and the Australian visa office, all from the comfort of my home in Vermont. I couldn‚Äôt even participate in the event remotely, because of the time zone difference. This is all very disappointing, but I tried to make the best of it. I‚Äôve been busy with the next iteration of this project, and enjoying a bit of ‚Äústaycation‚Äù time here in New England (hence this month‚Äôs cover photo).</p>



<p>In any case, my paper <em>did</em> get published, and I‚Äôd still like to share the materials I presented virtually at the conference. It‚Äôs mostly intended for a technical audience, but I hope at least some of my readers will find it interesting. The paper is titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638530.3654259">A Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm for Co-evolving Genotypes and Genotype / Phenotype Maps</a>, and is available for free online. I had to cut it down to just four pages, since it was accepted as a poster, so I also wrote up an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype-results/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md">extended analysis of my results</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1/blob/main/README.md">hoverview of my algorithm&#8217;s implementation</a>,  for those who want to go deeper. There&#8217;s also a digital version of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3x58W46RPuXOkqY6NavS6ndpeaEgiZB/view?usp=drive_link">poster</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ej09sxSULmzwNd65EPQInTUySmsUtiq/view?usp=drive_link">short video</a> overview of my experiment.</p>



<p>I continue to work on this idea, and it is starting to evolve beyond what I presented in that paper. Right now, I‚Äôm actively deconstructing and rebuilding the algorithm. CPPNs are an important and well known part of the AI field, so I‚Äôm trying to describe precisely how my algorithm is different, and which of those differences account for the remarkable results I found. Originally I thought of this research as being about epigenetics specifically, but as I try to generalize and simplify, what I‚Äôm left with looks like straight-up endosymbiosis. I‚Äôve been thinking of this algorithm as a metaphor for a cell and its genes / nucleus, but it could just as easily be a metaphor for an animal and its community of microbes. This is exciting, since I‚Äôd love to do more research on endosymbiosis, and I really like the idea that perhaps symbiosis is the driving force behind intelligence as we know it, fundamentally changing the dynamics of evolution.</p>



<p>Anyway, that‚Äôs how I see it for the moment, and where I hope my research will lead in the near future. For now, though, I‚Äôm wrapping up my summer with a few more fun outings, and preparing for the start of classes later this month. I‚Äôll be diving deep into both evolutionary computation and deep learning, which I‚Äôm really looking forward to.</p>

<p>Later this month, I‚Äôll be attending the <a href="https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/HomePage">Genetic and Evolutionary Computing Conference</a> (GECCO) in Melbourne, Australia. I‚Äôm super excited to go, and to present my very first published academic paper as a poster. I‚Äôll share more here when all is said and done, but unfortunately my paper isn‚Äôt really intended for a general audience, like this blog. It would probably be hard to understand for anyone outside of the fields of AI or ALife. So, for everybody else, I‚Äôd like to share what the paper means to me, and what I‚Äôm trying to say by publishing it.</p>



<p>My research is inspired by epigenetics, and new ways of thinking about evolution. I saw that life doesn‚Äôt just evolve by chance, it evolves to become more evolvable. It learns how to explore the range of possible forms and lifestyles more efficiently, and to nudge evolution down more fruitful paths. Life uses its intelligence to become more intelligent still. In my mind, this changes <em>everything</em> about evolution, and I was shocked it wasn‚Äôt more well known. Most discussions of evolution (and the programmer version: evolutionary computation, or EC) are too simple, and ignore these critical details. So, I figured I‚Äôd be the one to bring this up, and show people why it matters.</p>



<p>I started my first experiment before I even got to university. I was so excited by the idea, I just had to get it out of my head. I actually avoided looking for prior work, because I wanted to see how <em>I</em> would manifest this idea without being biased by other people‚Äôs thinking. Besides, I didn‚Äôt know of any research like mine, and I didn‚Äôt know how to find it, either. That‚Äôs why I applied to UVM. When I got here, my advisor and lab mates encouraged me to publish this project, and pointed me at the relevant literature. So I hit the books, reading all that had been done before in order to put my own work into context.</p>



<p>And, of course, I found I‚Äôm not the first to have this idea. There are many variations of EC inspired by biology, looking for the ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù that makes life more powerful than our computer models. In particular, how life evolves to be more evolvable is an active area of research, which has been building momentum in recent years. At first, I was disappointed. My idea was already taken! So much of what I thought made my project interesting had been tried before in some other context. But not exactly. Identifying those subtle differences has been tremendously helpful.</p>



<p>You see, it‚Äôs pretty well established now that ‚Äúevolvability‚Äù is important. In our experiments, simulated life that‚Äôs more evolvable finds fitter solutions faster. It‚Äôs better at adapting to changing circumstances, too. It seems to be smarter and more creative. I find this exhilarating, yet these discoveries didn‚Äôt ‚Äúchange everything‚Äù like I had hoped. In the experiments so far, it feels like an incremental improvement. It helps, but not enough to draw much attention away from other areas of AI research, like deep learning, which is seen as much more powerful and more productive.</p>



<p>I think that‚Äôs because we still haven‚Äôt broken out of our old ways of thinking. Traditional EC is all about finding good solutions to a problem, but I would argue that evolution isn‚Äôt about problem solving. It‚Äôs about problem <em>finding</em>. Life explores the space of possible lifestyles to find and exploit <em>opportunities</em>. The evolution of life is a bit like a slime mold. It grows simultaneously in all directions, questing around obstacles to find resources, reinforcing the branches that get lucky, culling back the ones that don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt have a top-down view of the world, but it‚Äôs still <em>strategic</em> and <em>adaptive</em>. When I look at most of the existing experiments in this space, I feel like we‚Äôre putting a slime mold into a narrow tunnel and measuring how fast it can get to the other end. We‚Äôre accidentally putting evolution in a straight jacket, and blinding ourselves to what makes it so interesting and powerful.</p>



<p>So, in my first experiment, I try to show a different perspective. I made a single algorithm that can adapt itself to solve many <em>different</em> tasks. Normally, an EC programmer picks one task to solve, then designs an evolutionary search strategy to suit that problem. They invent a genome language, a way of turning that into a solution, and ways of randomly tweaking the genome that might lead to better solutions. In my experiment, I evolved the search strategy, too. As the programmer, I designed a vast and open ended search domain, and many ways that the algorithm could restrict that space. But I wasn‚Äôt sure which restricted sub-spaces would work best, and, unlike traditional EC, I didn‚Äôt try to guess. I just let the algorithm figure that out for itself.</p>



<p>The way I did this is also interesting. It turns out, the algorithm I invented is strikingly similar to one that‚Äôs already popular: ‚Äúcompositional pattern-producing networks,‚Äù or CPPNs. Again, it was a little frustrating to be scooped, but I‚Äôm using this algorithm in a new way. Instead of evolving new ‚Äúbodies‚Äù for simulated life, I‚Äôm evolving new <em>ways of generating</em> bodies. It‚Äôs a subtle difference, but an important one, I think. That extra level of indirection gives evolution more influence over its destiny, and the power to make more complex patterns in ways I couldn‚Äôt even anticipate. Now that I know how my idea is so similar to, yet different from, an existing algorithm, I‚Äôm teasing apart those differences, to measure the impact of each one.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm proud of my work, and excited to talk about it with other EC enthusiasts at GECCO. On the other hand, I‚Äôm still figuring out how to do science, and there‚Äôs a lot I <em>don‚Äôt</em> like about my first paper. This project was mostly my way of proving to myself that this crazy idea could work. The results are intriguing, but it‚Äôs not yet a clear example of what I want to show. It‚Äôs also complicated, unusual, and hard to explain, even to other EC researchers. If I want people to get excited about this, I need to simplify, make my work more relatable, and find better ways to demonstrate and measure the novel behavior I‚Äôm talking about here. There are no ‚Äúobstacle courses for slime molds‚Äù in the EC literature that I know of, so perhaps I‚Äôll need to design some.</p>



<p>Hopefully, I‚Äôll get lots of inspiration and feedback at GECCO. As I learn more about the field of EC, I‚Äôm finding more and more examples of work similar, yet slightly different, from my own. This is great, because each of those differences is an opportunity for a new experiment, to see if my perspective can shed light on something new. I‚Äôm already dreaming up all sorts of new ways to explore my ideas. And that‚Äôs more or less how I hope to spend the next several years. Maybe <em>that‚Äôs</em> my PhD.</p>



<p>In any case, I hope that explanation was interesting, and not too vague. I‚Äôll get more specific in a few weeks, when I post a follow up with the full GECCO paper, the poster I presented, a video summary of that poster, and links to some supplemental results and analysis. I bet I‚Äôll have some fun things to report from my time in Melbourne, too! As always, I‚Äôd love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>I just published a new coding project! If you&#8217;ve been following along, this is the &#8220;grown up&#8221; version of a <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/i-built-a-thing/">demo project</a> I posted last year.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s further exploration of what I call an ‚Äúepigenetic algorithm.‚Äù It‚Äôs inspired by a simple observation: in living cells, the process of evolution is actively managed by the cell, which itself is an evolved mechanism. Using evolution to optimize evolution seems like a powerful trick, so I‚Äôm trying to reproduce it in small-scale AI experiments. I hope to make evolutionary computing more open-ended, more successful in vast search spaces, and less biased by the programmer. In this case, I‚Äôm generating cool looking Game of Life simulations, but I hope to find many more practical applications in the future.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm not sure whether or not I will publish this as a work of science. It‚Äôs complicated and weird and there‚Äôs more work involved to make this a proper controlled experiment. As I learn more, I‚Äôm already thinking of other ways to explore this idea that might be more effective. So, for now, the plan is just to share the code and I may or may not revisit this later, depending on where my other leads take me.&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I gave a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZIYj8Rg4xPHukQ-Glk9_IZTgimEYh5dtWsyXrbkX9Dc/edit?usp=sharing">presentation</a> that covers the motivation, results, and challenges of this project for a technical audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello there, reader. I hope you‚Äôve been enjoying the blog. It‚Äôs been about two years since I began, and in that time a lot has happened. I moved from California to Vermont and started a PhD program at UVM. That‚Äôs going great, but it‚Äôs keeping me very busy, and I think I have to make some changes.</p>



<p>So far, I‚Äôve been posting a full-length blog post every month, but I don‚Äôt think I can keep up that pace. I‚Äôve got a few finished posts queued up, but I‚Äôve had barely any time to work on new ones since classes began. So, this will be the last post for the year, then, starting in January, I will try posting every <em>three</em> months. Hopefully that will be a more sustainable pace. I might also experiment with shorter / less formal posts. We‚Äôll see!</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I‚Äôd share a bit about my grad school experience so far. At the time of writing this, I‚Äôm about two thirds of the way through my first semester.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here at UVM, I find myself completely surrounded by interesting people, ideas, and projects. It‚Äôs electrifying. I don‚Äôt know if my mind has ever been so stimulated before. I‚Äôm often pooling my mind with many other brilliant people, and I love that feeling. Whenever I have the kind of idea that might show up in this blog, I have many people at hand who want to talk about it and have interesting contributions. And they‚Äôre pulling me into interesting conversations all the time! I‚Äôm reading all sorts of interesting papers in AI, philosophy of mind, and biology. I‚Äôm integrating that knowledge by writing papers and building fun little software projects for class. So far, most of what I‚Äôm learning isn‚Äôt radically new or different, but I‚Äôm fleshing out my understanding in much more depth, discovering fun tangents, learning precise vocabulary and specialized tools, and building out vast webs of mental connections.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on research yet, but I&#8217;m excited about my prospects. I see reflections of my ideas in the work of others‚Äô, and vice versa. It‚Äôs helping see new angles and new possibilities. I‚Äôm talking very actively with my advisor and fellow students about potential projects and collaborations. I came to UVM with lots of things I‚Äôd like to try (many related to this blog), but now the challenge is integration. How do I pursue my interests in the context of the lab? How do I make use of new ideas I&#8217;m discovering and find exciting? How do I connect with the work of other researchers, to make my contributions relevant and interesting to the field? It‚Äôs forcing me to question myself, reframe things, explain myself, and find inspiration in others‚Äô ideas.</p>



<p>This is exactly what I was hoping for. I‚Äôve been on my own since leaving Google, and the experience is just underscoring something I know to be true: human minds aren‚Äôt meant to work alone. We&#8217;re social creatures, and most of us just cannot reach our full capacity in isolation. At UVM, my mind is constantly stimulated, and I‚Äôm always challenged to stretch myself, try new ideas, and make new contributions. I feel I can go much further here, and accomplish great things. Of course, the flip side is that it‚Äôs <em>exhausting</em>, especially while I‚Äôm still new and figuring out how things work here. The pace of activity is very fast, and there‚Äôs much more to read, do, and learn than I could possibly fit into a day.</p>



<p>In some sense, that‚Äôs already very familiar. My experience at Google (especially near the end, when I was leading teams) was also a fast paced, continuous, information overload. The key skills for dealing with that are prioritization and time management. I just have to pick what to spend my time on, and let everything else pass me by with minimal interference. Thankfully, I‚Äôve gotten really good at that.</p>



<p>Still, I‚Äôm definitely feeling challenged right now, and so busy I barely have time to breathe. There are a few reasons for that. One is just that the pace of life was so much gentler over the past couple of years as I made this transition. I was working very hard, but my work was self-paced and I had very little external pressure. I took my time. Nobody was depending on me, or judging my performance. So, I‚Äôm having the jarring experience of suddenly stepping onto a moving treadmill. Only now, after a few months of settling in, have I found a good rhythm where I can keep up with all my work, have a life, and also pursue my own research goals.</p>



<p>This is also hard because I‚Äôm running on a very different sort of treadmill than what I experienced at Google. In a sense, it‚Äôs easier. I have a ton of work to do, but it‚Äôs mostly low-stakes reading, writing, and coding at a steady pace. As a manager at Google, my work was mostly decisions, strategy, and people issues. I spent a lot of time moving from crisis to crisis. I had to act quickly and decisively with limited information. My decisions would have a big, often irreversible impact on people‚Äôs lives (sometimes individuals I knew and cared about, and sometimes millions of strangers). I was accountable for those human consequences. That‚Äôs stressful! By comparison, grad school work is fun and low pressure.</p>



<p>In another sense, Google was actually much easier than academia, because it was highly structured. There, everyone had a well defined job role with explicit expectations. We had official priorities and ways of doing things that everyone adhered to. Everyone was organized into teams, which served complementary purposes and fit into a coherent whole. Leaders held meetings with regular cadences every week, month, quarter, etc., checking in on progress and aligning people on their mission, values, goals, and priorities. We never lived up to the ideal, but Google felt a bit like a clockwork mechanism. We all had a function, individually and collectively, and we worked together in lock-step to make it happen.</p>



<p>Academia and science are <em>far</em> less structured. Every PhD, every lab, every department, and every school do things differently. There are very few hard constraints, and anything that fits within them is valid. In grad school, lectures and assignments feel a bit more like ‚Äúrecommended work,‚Äù and you&#8217;re expected to invest only as much into them as makes sense for your needs. This is freeing, but also in some sense very frustrating. There are no best practices. Nobody can tell me what to do, or how to succeed. There‚Äôs very little indication of how I‚Äôm doing, or what progress I‚Äôm making. Everyone‚Äôs working more or less independently, on only sorta related projects, within a vaguely defined scope, based on their own judgment. There‚Äôs little sharing, few standards, and plenty of waste.</p>



<p>That said, science <em>should</em> be less structured than engineering. It <em>must</em> be. The university is designed this way to encourage diverse ways of thinking and of approaching problems. The challenge of science is that we don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt know what to look for, where to look, or how we&#8217;ll find it. Very often important truths are hidden behind common ideas and practices that everyone ‚Äúknows‚Äù to be right, even though they are blatantly wrong! It‚Äôs important that students can follow in the footsteps of great thinkers and flesh out their works, but also that they can go in completely new directions and find what was overlooked. The chaos and freedom can be challenging, but it‚Äôs a necessary ingredient for innovation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Well, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on with me. I hope my thoughts on grad student life are interesting. I will start experimenting with the format of this blog and see where it goes. If you have any thoughts or suggestions about that, please let me know! If you‚Äôd like to stay more up to date on what I‚Äôm doing and thinking, I‚Äôm most active on Mastodon. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s basically a smaller, nerdier version of Twitter that isn&#8217;t owned by an alt-right friendly oligarch, and with much healthier communication norms and moderation practices. I post there pretty often, and I respond to most comments / DMs. You can find my profile <a href="http://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">here</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm excited to share that I will begin a PhD program with the <a href="https://uvm.edu/">University of Vermont</a> (UVM) this Fall. That means Christina, Socks, and I are moving to Burlington, far from our home in Silicon Valley. We think it‚Äôs worth it, because the <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/">Vermont Complex Systems Center</a> is a unique community, with a perspective on intelligence that really speaks to me, and a wealth of projects and experts on the niche topics I want to explore. They‚Äôre also great people. I look forward to working with Josh Bongard, Nick Cheney, and their labs on research at the intersection of cellular biology, robotics, and machine learning. I‚Äôm particularly excited at the prospect of joining the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cells-form-into-xenobots-on-their-own-20210331/">Xenobots</a> research program, which is perhaps the coolest thing ever. It seems like a great opportunity to study the intelligence of cells and bodies first hand, to build computer models of intelligence <em>without</em> brains, and potentially to contribute to some truly amazing medical applications in the distant future. More on this as I learn and get involved first hand‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Well, that‚Äôs a wrap on 2022. I‚Äôve been sharing my ideas with you here for twelve whole months now. The year sure did go by fast, and it‚Äôs been both exciting and productive. In addition to this blog, I‚Äôve done some fascinating <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838-nate-gaylinn?ref=nav_mybooks&amp;shelf=read&amp;sort=date_read">reading</a>, met like-minded professors from around the country and explored their work (if you like my blog, you might also want to check out the <a href="https://disi.org/manyminds/">Many Minds</a> podcast, it‚Äôs awesome), and even published a new open source <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype">software prototype</a>. I applied to five different graduate programs, and should hear back from them in the Spring. What a whirlwind!</p>



<p>Thanks for coming on this journey with me and taking the time to explore these big ideas. It means the world to me, and it helps keep me motivated. I plan to post here for years to come, and I hope you‚Äôll stick around. If you‚Äôve enjoyed reading along so far, please go back and ‚Äúlike‚Äù your favorite posts. This will give me a clear signal of what you appreciate most, so I can make more like that in the future. I‚Äôd also love to hear from you in the comments if you have any feedback, requests, or just wanna say hi. I‚Äôm still getting to know you and figuring out what this blog should be, so don‚Äôt be a stranger.

<p>This blog allows me to explore a very wide range of ideas, usually from a high level and for a general audience. I&#8217;m also doing some very specific, very technical research inspired by these ideas.</p>



<p>Today, I&#8217;m launching my first prototype. It&#8217;s just a proof of concept, really. A chance for me to flesh out some half-baked ideas and make them concrete. The results aren&#8217;t very interesting yet, but if you&#8217;d like to know what the technical side of my work looks like, here&#8217;s a sneak peek.</p>



<p>You can find the source code and a detailed walk-through of the project <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype">here</a>.</p>



<p>You can find the results and analysis <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype-results/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md">here</a>, complete with lots of pretty videos and charts.</p>

<p>Over the years, many books have played part in shaping my understanding of intelligence. I recently finished writing reviews for all my favorites on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144426838-nate-gaylinn">Goodreads</a>. If you&#8217;re curious where my ideas come from or want to find something new to read, check it out. Right now I&#8217;m organizing everything into four categories:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=cognitive-fiction">Cognitive fiction</a>: Fun stories inspired by science that have something to say about minds, intelligence, or human nature.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=practical-non-fiction">Practical non-fiction</a>: Tools for making sense of the world or getting things done with your human brain.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=accessible-non-fiction">Accessible non-fiction</a>: Accessible science and philosophy books written for a general audience.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144426838?shelf=academic-non-fiction">Academic non-fiction</a>: Technical books for diving deep on these topics.</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;m reading very actively right now, so I&#8217;m adding new books all the time. I&#8217;d be happy to discuss any of these, and I&#8217;m always open to recommendations.</p>
