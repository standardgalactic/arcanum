<p>(this post&#8217;s image is a cross stitch I made from <a href="https://studioansitru.bigcartel.com/product/don-t-be-a-prick-digital-download-only">a pattern by Studio Ansitru</a>. The phrase &#8220;don&#8217;t be a prick&#8221; is surrounded by a variety of cacti in pretty greens and oranges on a light blue background. In my home, it serves as a reminder to myself and to my guests.)</p>



<p>A popular metaphor for the mind is a pilot sitting in a cockpit, monitoring the senses and making every decision. This is obviously nonsense, but it’s an intuitive and helpful metaphor at times. The brain really does have “an executive” that thinks and plans and makes decisions, it just doesn’t have “a mind of its own,” and its power over the self is surprisingly limited. Self-control and -awareness are important for living a good life, being productive, and making ethical decisions. Unfortunately, when these faculties fail, as they often do, it&#8217;s easy to blame yourself. I find it helps to understand how these systems work, so I can set more realistic expectations for myself, which makes me less disappointed when things go awry.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important thing to know about the brain is that it’s not one, unified thing. Brains are modular, with many distinct regions specialized for different tasks. Each region has different inputs and outputs, meaning they each monitor the world in different ways from different perspectives, and can cause different behaviors. Observations, insights, desires, and actions can originate in pretty much any part of the brain. All of these different regions operate together at the same time, and conscious experience is an integration of all that activity. What I think, feel, believe, and do is mostly the product of what specific regions in my brain activate together, and in what order.</p>



<p>This story of how brains work is surprisingly consistent across the animal kingdom. Even very simple creatures, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5010568365">honey bees</a> for instance, have complex brains with specialized regions and global integration that likely creates a sort of conscious awareness. It seems likely, however, that bees lack the sort of self-awareness and top-down control that humans do. Without it, the brain is more chaotic. Each part tries to do the right thing more or less independently. Integration means that most faculties are aware of each other and can influence each other, so there is some coordination and consistency. But focus is mostly determined by which brain region is loudest, and decisions happen moment by moment, without planning or intentional coherence.</p>



<p>Decentralized brains work extremely well, but they have their limitations. More complex animals have more versatile behaviors that need more explicit coordination to generate coherent, reliable, and goal-directed behavior. Most large animals seem to have this ability. In all mammals, it’s more or less identified with a brain region known as the prefrontal cortex, or PFC. The PFC is responsible for monitoring all the activity in the brain. It builds up a rich model of the self, its relationships, needs, and long-term goals. It’s responsible for planning and for exerting control over other parts of the brain. It can shut out distractions and use willpower to encourage good behaviors and discourage bad ones, even when I’d selfishly prefer to do something else.</p>



<p><em>The PFC tells the story of “you,” and has strong opinions about how that story is supposed to go.</em></p>



<p>Although all mammals have a PFC (and many other species have something analogous), the relative <em>size</em> of the PFC varies quite a bit between species, and that seems to correlate with executive control and what people often think of as “intelligence.” Animals with large PFCs are better at self-control, problem solving, and forming complex social relationships. Humans have exceptionally large PFCs, which partly explains why we’re so different from other species. It’s important to remember, though, this is a difference in magnitude, not in kind. It’s likely that <em>every</em> mammal and <em>many</em> other species have human-like self-awareness and self-control. It’s just a weaker faculty for them, one that acts less often, and is less able to dominate the rest of the mind.</p>



<p>The PFC is the closest thing to a “pilot” the brain has, but it’s better to think of it as just one brain region among many. It’s one voice in a chorus. It tends to be more bossy, spending a lot of energy trying to influence or even override other parts of the brain, but it’s not “in control.” Like a corporate executive, the PFC has only limited visibility into what the rest of the brain is doing, can’t afford to stay ever-vigilant, and can’t <em>force</em> a brain region to fall in line, especially when the orders run counter to that region’s nature. The PFC also isn’t capable of doing much on its own. It depends on the rest of the brain to notice things, interpret them, suggest actions, and implement them. All it can do is adjudicate and coordinate. It resolves conflict, makes plans, and advises each brain region about when and how to do its thing.</p>



<p>One consequence of all this is that self-control is actually a very limited and fragile thing. Often, my PFC just sits back and lets the rest of the brain work with minimal intervention. Usually that works great, but sometimes it means I miss something important. I may act out of impulse or habit and not notice until it’s too late that I’m going against my values, intentions, or best interests. Other times I know exactly what I <em>should</em> do, but can’t seem to make it happen. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. I can’t force myself to sit down, focus, and avoid distractions. Perhaps I’m grumpy, tired, or impatient and I do something rude or inappropriate without meaning to at all.</p>



<p>When this happens, it’s easy to blame myself. I lost control. I did something foolish. I acted selfishly and impulsively, like a bad person. In reality, though, this happens all the time, usually for mundane reasons that I have little control over. The PFC is energy intensive, so it gets impaired whenever my blood sugar is low, I’m tired, or I’m stressed. Other brain regions also have the ability to <em>interfere</em> with the PFC, especially the limbic system which manages emotions and the fight-or-flight response. Some diseases (like depression and long COVID) can cause “brain fog,” which is closely related to reduced executive function. It’s also possible to injure the PFC, from a stroke, a tumor, or a physical injury (as in the famous case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>).</p>



<p>Knowing this helps me feel a little less personally responsible when I have a lapse of self-control. It really is inevitable, common, and completely natural. Still, I want to have good judgment and do the right thing as much as possible! How do I do that? One answer is to simply be aware of my limitations and to work around them. I try to notice when I’m hungry, tired, or emotional and avoid making big decisions or socializing at those times. Instead, I might get a snack, take a break, or sleep on it so I feel more in control. The only other good technique I know is mindfulness meditation. Despite the mystical reputation, the main purpose of meditation is quite practical: it trains the PFC. By practicing the skill of observing the mind and exerting influence over it, I can build that muscle. It’s not a silver bullet, but meditation helps me use my PFC more often and more effectively, and it makes me more aware of when my PFC is in a weakened state.</p>



<p>So, in a sense, there really is a “pilot” in every brain. It’s just not an ever vigilant, intelligent, wise, and rational person. Instead, it’s one brain region out of many, with limited visibility and a narrow job description. The PFC observes what the other brain regions are seeing, thinking, and doing and uses that top-down view to nudge them into more coherent and effective patterns of behavior. It’s not “the self” and it’s not “in control.” In fact, it has very limited influence, isn’t always active, and even with training there are lots of common reasons it might grow weak or misbehave. For this reason, having great self-control is often less about will power in the moment, and more about avoiding temptation in the first place.</p>



<p>What do you think? Does this agree with your first-hand experience? Do you have any insights you could share about self-awareness, self-control, or motivation? What about being kind to yourself when your self-control inevitably falls short? If so, I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(I took this posts&#8217;s photo of a banana slug crawling through leaf litter. It&#8217;s shape and color resembles some of the leaves, which makes it hard to spot if you don&#8217;t know what to look for)</p>



<p>People say all sorts of things about the world, but how can you tell what’s right? If you’re not sure, you probably want to see for yourself. Those other people might be confused, mistaken, suffering from wishful thinking, or actively trying to mislead you, but <em>you</em> see reality for what it is. Right? At the least, you won’t have the <em>same</em> misperceptions as them, so another look is useful. But how much can you trust your own senses? How does perception even work, and how come we’re so often misled?</p>



<p>Like most people, I “just see” everything around me. Sometimes, I become aware of my perspective. I move around to get a clear view. I notice where I’m glancing, and I know I can’t see what’s behind my head. Yet, most of the time I <em>don’t</em> think about those things at all. The visual world just seems to surround me seamlessly, with rich, consistent detail in all directions. Objects are plain to see, trivial to discern from most angles and distances. It all seems so obvious, like a simple “window on reality,” yet nothing could be farther from the truth.</p>



<p>Human eyes have tunnel vision. I only see a tiny spot in clear focus at a time. My eyes constantly dart around, collecting many snapshots of the world as I move through it. My brain gets a continuous stream of these disconnected snatches of imagery that it somehow must turn into an integrated whole. It tracks my position and perspective as I move through the world, to piece the images together and infer a 3D model of my surroundings. This takes a great deal of real time data processing, and more than a little creativity.</p>



<p>One thing humans <em>don’t</em> do is scan a scene from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, like a TV camera, capturing equally high fidelity data of a whole scene. My eyes are drawn to “interesting” features of the visual field, gathering much more detail about those, and leaving large gaps over the “boring” parts of the image where I never bothered to look closely. To get a sense of this yourself, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo&amp;ab_channel=DanielSimons">selective attention test</a> on YouTube. It’s pretty shocking how well the brain filters relevant details from irrelevant ones, and shows you only what it thinks is useful. Of course, what’s “interesting” or “useful” is a judgment call, and I’m biased by my context, culture, and evolution. That means I’m blind to important things that I don’t expect, recognize, or know about.</p>



<p>Yet, I don’t notice any gaps in my perception. My brain creates the illusion of a clear and complete view of reality, using a technique called hierarchical segmentation. The image from my eyes is projected into my brain, then layer after layer of neurons <em>interpret</em> that image. The first layer detects patterns and discontinuities in the raw image data: edges. The second layer detects patterns in those edges: shapes. Layers above detect patterns of patterns of patterns, finding textures, objects, faces, bodies, groups, situations, and more. I <em>don’t</em> see pixels, colors, and shapes. I <em>directly perceive</em> the objects and agents in a scene, their properties, activities, and relationships. I experience that as if it were “really there,” even though it’s just a model in my mind, distantly derived from sense data.</p>



<p>The first pass of vision notices low-level features present in the image (edges, corners, curves), but doesn’t know what they mean. Later passes piece those features together to represent larger features (in a desk drawer, that arrangement of curves <em>must</em> be a fidget spinner). Most likely, the lower-level processing didn’t see <em>all</em> the relevant details clearly, but that’s okay. The fidget spinner neurons see enough to recognize what’s there. They tell the edge-detecting neurons what they <em>should have seen</em>, filling in the missing details. This is how I can clearly perceive a whole fidget spinner, even though it’s in shadow and half covered. My brain uses past knowledge of objects, where they appear, what they look like, and how they behave to imagine what was obscured.</p>



<p>This works extremely well, and it’s <em>necessary</em>, since low-level sensory data is noisy and ambiguous. It often helps to have some idea what I’m looking at to make sense of what I’m seeing. Yet, sometimes my brain’s predictions are wrong. That’s <em>not</em> actually a fidget spinner in the drawer, it’s a pile of coins. How could I tell? Well, the fidget spinner neurons projected their predictions down, but looking a little more closely, some of those guesses were clearly wrong. There were some edges that weren’t accounted for, some angles that didn’t fit. The lower level neurons noticed the gap between expectation and reality, so they had to push back and negotiate with the higher level neurons, eventually arriving at an interpretation that was the best compromise across multiple levels of analysis.</p>



<p>What I perceive is a blending of what my senses took in and what “makes sense” for me to see based on past experience. At first glance, I only notice the most eye-catching details and my mind fills in the rest. If I take my time to really look over a scene, exploring every corner and paying attention to details, then my past experience has less influence and I perceive reality more like it truly is. I’m giving my lower-level perceptions the best chance to find evidence that I wasn’t expecting to see, which might revise my first impression. The problem is, I can’t afford to do this all the time, and often don’t think to. When should I bother to put in the extra effort? When should I distrust my own perception of reality enough to double check?</p>



<p>My brain automatically groups every object I see into <em>categories</em>, collections of objects with similar properties. Each category has a mental <em>stereotype</em>, an image that sort of averages all my experiences. This is how I know the “normal” shape of a fidget spinner, even though no two are the same. It’s where my mind draws from when it fills the gaps in my perception. As I gain experience, I learn more useful ways to group things into categories that better predict their similarities and differences. I build more accurate, nuanced, and fine-grain stereotypes, which makes my perceptions clearer. That said, it’s easy to hold onto bad stereotypes. They warp my perception, overwriting key details of a visual scene that might prove me wrong, rendering them <em>literally invisible</em> to me until someone points them out.</p>



<p>Stereotypes play a central role in perception, and all the fancy understanding, thinking, and being human that layers on top of that. Stereotypes are great tools. They’re bite-sized models of reality that let us generalize past experience and predict the future. But they aren’t real. In fact, many of my stereotypes aren’t based on my experience at all. I learned them from other people! Some may be wrong, hurtful, and dangerous, but I wouldn&#8217;t know without personal experience. So far we’ve just been talking about objects, but it gets serious when we move onto people.</p>



<p>I saw this when I worked at Google. They would spoil engineers, with easy access to everything from staplers to lunch to massages. That meant lots of staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and in good working order. These service workers—these <em>people</em>—were generally ignored, treated as part of the environment rather than part of the team. That’s problematic in itself, but also engineers with darker skin tones often reported being mistaken for the service staff. Despite wearing a nerdy T-shirt and an engineering badge, they got categorized as “the help” based on skin alone. They were ignored, or worse, asked to clean up spills. This was demoralizing, even though there was no ill-intent. They just weren’t seen, by folks who were misled by stereotypes and didn’t even notice.</p>



<p>Knowing all this makes me distrust my own senses, but I think that’s a good thing. They’re <em>mostly</em> reliable, but they can fail in specific ways, and it’s important to remember that. It’s also useful to know <em>when</em> to trust my stereotypes. That mostly comes down to knowing where I have deep personal experience and have paid close attention. Where I don’t, my stereotype might be a shallow hand-me-down, even though it feels just as &#8220;real&#8221; in my mind. What about you? Have you noticed folks seeing what they want to see, or hearing what they want to hear? How does this generalize to other kinds of perceptions? How do you try to see reality for what it truly is? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

<p>(This post&#8217;s featured image is <em>not</em> a photo of the idyllic California vineyard my wife and I visited in 2015, but a similar looking AI-generated fiction)</p>



<p>The excitement around large language models (LLMs) continues. Often just called “AI,” this new technology takes instructions in plain English, and generates new text or images so good you’d think a human made them. There are some serious concerns about the ethics of how this is done (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots</a>), and many articles warning people that LLMs aren’t as human as they seem. Still, these LLMs are clearly doing <em>something</em> smart, and it’s weirdly compelling. What’s going on here? What can LLMs teach us about the human mind, our strengths and weaknesses, and why we&#8217;re so easily fooled and mesmerized by this tech?</p>



<p>There are lots of articles about how LLMs work and their limitations (I even wrote <a href="https://thinkingwithnate.wordpress.com/2022/06/15/large-language-models-lamda-and-sentience/">one</a> a while back), so I won’t go into much detail here. What matters for now is that LLMs are <em>prediction engines</em>. Given some text, they try to guess how a human would respond, based on a statistical analysis of all the content on the internet. They do this extremely well, but not perfectly. LLMs don’t think, perceive, or interact with the world in a human-like way, so sometimes they make weird mistakes a human never would.</p>



<p>In some ways, the human brain works a lot like an LLM. From day one, the brain is looking for language. It automatically builds up vast networks of words, concepts, and their relationships. When I hear someone talking, my mind is suddenly filled with the speaker’s ideas and their associations, building up an image in my mind’s eye. This is basically what an LLM does.</p>



<p>However, I also have many other intelligent faculties that join in. I don’t just know that “dog” is a word related to “cat.” I have memories of specific dogs, what their fur felt like, and the experiences we shared. I have common sense, logic, and theory of mind to decide whether something I hear is truth, fantasy, error, or deception. I monitor my own thoughts to gauge my level of confidence and correct my mistakes. I anticipate the future, make plans, and use language to achieve my goals. LLMs don’t do any of that.</p>



<p>Of course, there are AI researchers working to approximate these other kinds of human intelligence (though progress here is limited compared with LLMs themselves). <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43999120-rebooting-ai?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=fL2RVBG7dY&amp;rank=3">Rebooting AI</a> is a great book exploring that work, which argues its just a matter of time before AI can do everything a human can. Personally, I&#8217;m skeptical that we&#8217;ll ever reverse engineer all the subtlety of human thought, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say that AIs will become more powerful and well-rounded in the future. Perhaps the more important question is whether building increasingly realistic human simulations is a good idea at all.</p>



<p>For now, LLMs are a bit of a one-trick pony. What’s scary is that one trick is often good enough to fool humans and do useful work. In particular, even though LLMs were designed to be text prediction engines, they are surprisingly good at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">general problem solving</a>. They can paint pictures, do math, solve brain teasers, and even write and simulate computer programs. Maybe those “extra” faculties of the human mind aren’t so important after all?</p>



<p>LLMs “think” in terms of words and relationships and patterns they’ve seen before. In human terms, that means stereotypes, cliches, generalizing from past “experience,” and repeating what they are told. We like to think that human thought is more sophisticated than that, but it often isn’t. We sometimes don&#8217;t see people as individuals, but in terms of the role they play in society (ie, &#8220;barista&#8221; or &#8220;mom&#8221;). We make decisions based on rules of thumb or gut feeling, without the need for logic and reasoning. We talk about things we don’t fully comprehend. We repeat talking points in order to fit in with our tribe. We confidently make up nonsense just to satisfy each other and move on. It’s surprising how LLM-like humans can be sometimes.</p>



<p>And that’s not meant to be derogatory! Those ways of thinking can be very effective. A lot of language <em>isn’t</em> about complex ideas, comprehension, and reasoning, but just putting one word after another to evoke an image in someone else’s mind. Past experience often <em>is</em> a highly effective and low-effort way to predict the future. Lying is anti-social, but “fake it ‘til you make it” <em>works</em>. One of the fastest ways to pick up a new skill is to boldly make mistakes, get feedback, and learn from that experience. The main difference is that today&#8217;s LLMs don&#8217;t learn from their mistakes, they never doubt their &#8220;intuition,&#8221; and they have no alternative ways of &#8220;thinking&#8221; when these techniques fall short.</p>



<p>So, yeah, LLMs only do part of what humans do, but it’s a big and important part. Occasionally we do need facts, critical thinking, self-doubt, and all the rest to do the right thing, but they don’t come up as often as we like to think. The real danger of LLMs, then, is that 80% of the time they might be good enough, but 20% of the time we need fancy human judgment to notice they screwed up and decide what to do. This is a serious problem. Humans are bad at vigilance, and we have a strong instinct to trust language, which in this case is exactly the <em>wrong</em> response.</p>



<p>Language is a defining feature of our species. We aren’t just <em>capable</em> of language, it’s a human universal. Every culture has language. Babies attend to speech from the moment they’re born, and start to babble in a few months. When there isn’t a common language spoken around them, children raised together will spontaneously <em>invent</em> one. Language is a biological imperative for us. It’s in our DNA.</p>



<p>When we perceive language, our minds automatically assume that it’s <em>communication</em>. We imagine another mind behind the words, usually with good intent and a desire to cooperate. Up until recently, this was a pretty safe assumption, so it was totally reasonable for the brain to immediately and automatically translate language into meaning. But now this instinct is backfiring. LLMs create realistic text and imagery <em>without any intentional meaning</em>. They don&#8217;t produce &#8220;answers,&#8221; &#8220;opinions,&#8221; or &#8220;art,&#8221; just random content that <em>looks</em> like those things. It&#8217;s both very difficult and important to remember that.</p>



<p>We’re still working to understand how these LLMs work, what their limitations are, and what they’re good for. As we do that, I hope we’ll come to understand ourselves better, too. What do you think? Have LLMs made you think about minds any differently? Have you seen any interesting examples of AIs acting strange or foolish? What about people acting like LLMs? Any thoughts or fears about computers gradually inching toward human-like abilities? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Emotions are a challenging topic. I’ve spent years learning to recognize and manage my own emotions in a productive way. I’ve also done a lot of reading, learning from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral biology how emotions work on a theoretical and practical level. That’s useful, but the actual experience of emotions and how they shape our minds, our well-being, and our lives is incredibly subtle and complicated. I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand it, but I find it fascinating because emotions serve as a sort of interface between two different kinds of human intelligence: the body and the mind.</p>



<p>I like to think of the body as an autonomous robot. It does its best to survive, sustain itself, and react appropriately to whatever&#8217;s happening, recruiting the mind to understand the world and make wise decisions. That robot has evolved many different modes of behavior, each suited to particular needs, problems, and contexts. One of the main challenges for controlling the body, then, is choosing which state to be in right now. Should I look for food? Flirt with a potential mate? Take shelter and conserve my energy? Run for my life? Being successful means constantly monitoring my situation, dynamically switching from state to state, to make sure my behaviors fit the moment.</p>



<p>In human beings, there are tons of these “states,” but they’re hard to count since they’re so multi-dimensional and blurred at the edges. Some of the most notable ones are the core emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger), but others are directly tied to the body’s function, like hunger, arousal, and fatigue. The state of the body is decided by a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters in the bloodstream, which coordinate activity across all the organ systems. They evolved before the brain, which is why the mind has only an indirect awareness of them. It experiences them as “feelings,” often by interpreting subtle and ambiguous signals like a flush of heat, a stirring in the guts, or a racing pulse.</p>



<p>That said, the brain plays a crucial role in emotions. The mind interprets what’s going on in the world to help trigger the right emotions, and emotions reconfigure the brain to serve in whatever activity the body is doing. Those chemicals in my bloodstream tune parts of my brain to be more or less active, reshaping my perception, judgment, and impulses. They shift my patterns of thought and behavior dramatically, whether I like it or not. When I’m angry, I’m more likely to perceive someone as a threat. I’m less likely to stop and think, and more likely to lash out. Looking back at the situation later with a clear head (that is, one that’s not flooded with neurotransmitters), I might see things very differently. That’s part of why recognizing emotions is so hard. Noticing and understanding are cognitive processes, happening inside my mind, while it’s being warped or even impaired by those emotions.</p>



<p>Another important factor at play here is how <em>non-linear</em> brains are. They’re collections of many different special-purpose sub-networks. These all work together in concert, combining their efforts, calling on each other, and riffing off each other to produce my stream of consciousness. This is an extremely powerful tool for creative thinking, quick intuitive action, and using metaphor to recall relevant experiences from the past. The flip side is that causality becomes very muddled. Ideas flow into one another in a sort of free-associative cascade, often forming self-reinforcing cycles. Every thought in my head is simultaneously cause <em>and</em> effect.</p>



<p>All these brain networks, ideas, and memories are linked together by associations, which cause them to resonate with each other and activate at the same time. These associations are often based on similarity or relevance, but emotions make some of the strongest and most common links. Most thoughts have emotional significance, and thinking those thoughts will evoke the associated feelings. Similarly, feelings evoke associated thoughts. More subtly, emotions also change my sense of salience. When I’m mad, I’m more likely to <em>notice</em> and fixate on thoughts and observations that resonate with that feeling of anger, while others get ignored.</p>



<p>This explains why it’s so hard to identify <em>why</em> I’m feeling an emotion. As a human being, I have a body evolved to react to immediate threats and opportunities, and a mind that spends much of its time thinking about abstract concepts, world events, and possible futures. This makes it very easy to misattribute my emotions. When I notice a feeling, I tend to associate it with whatever I was thinking or experiencing at that moment. This is often wrong, and that can cause problems.</p>



<p>A perfect example is displaced aggression. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, I was suddenly faced with many intense emotions, like anger, sadness, and fear. I carried these with me all the time, but there was little I could do to help, so I tried not to dwell on them. Nonetheless, I was much more irritable than usual. It was like my personality changed, and in a sense, it really did. I’d overreact to small slights and setbacks. I was more critical, aggressive, and impatient. I’d fixate on some insignificant detail from an email or meeting to the point where I’d be fuming  about it when I got home. I managed to stay professional and respectful at work, but it took a real effort to do so.</p>



<p>It’s worth emphasizing how harmful misattributing emotions can be. When I’m mad, anyone who crosses my path may stir that anger just by chance, tempting me to lash out. This means the people I interact with most—my coworkers, family, and friends—are the ones most at risk. There’s also the harm done to myself. When my dad was sick, I managed not to worry about that all the time, but mostly by worrying about <em>other</em> things instead. The distractions were easier to face, but also emotional and not really more productive. They did nothing to relieve my stress and irritability, which lingered on until I faced the root cause and processed those emotions.</p>



<p>Understanding all this has led me to a practice that I find works really well. Sometimes an idea or an experience gets me suddenly riled up and emotional. Often it’s something small and petty, or something grand and abstract, both good signs that the emotion is an overreaction. Whatever thought I’m having stirs up strong feelings, which in turn drives me to obsess more on the thought in an escalating cycle. I find myself ranting or ruminating. When I notice that happening, I try to calm myself down, get some exercise, and take a break to let the neurotransmitters dissipate so I can think clearly. Then, I can use the following technique.</p>



<p>I set aside the idea that bothered me, and instead I focus on the feelings that idea stirs up. I sit with them for a moment, and then I look at what <em>other</em> ideas resonate with them. Usually, there are several. Some are big, some small. Some are immediate and concrete, some distant and abstract. Often there’s one that stands out among all the others as the most salient, and it isn’t necessarily the idea I started with. That’s when I think, “Oh! So <em>that’s</em> what this is really about.” In other cases, I find lots of little things, unrelated, but piling on all at once. This helps me realize there’s no one cause for how I’m feeling right now, and it’s not fair or useful to blame a scapegoat for my generally bad day.</p>



<p>Emotions are a critical part of how the mind works. They define human values, shape our activities, and motivate everything we do. I hope reflecting on my own experience helps illuminate that. How does it resonate with you? Is your experience similar or different? Have you noticed other quirks about your emotions, your thoughts, and how they interact? Computers are generally emotionless, but a few chat bots simulate human-like emotion, and some agent-based AIs have their own system of states and “feelings,” suited to their artificial task and environment. How do you feel about emotional AIs?  I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I spend a lot of time in my own head. I’m a planner and a bit of a perfectionist. Part of me would love to always be in control of my life and everything in it (while another part of me realizes that would be <em>disastrous</em>). So, it’s been unsettling to learn how much of what my mind does is because of outside factors, like the way my brain is built, the situation I’m in, and my experiences growing up. In another sense, though, it’s a relief. Recognizing that my mind is limited, quirky, not entirely in my control, and less flexible than I imagined has helped me to loosen my grip. It’s helped me to go with the flow, and to channel my mental energy in more productive ways.</p>



<p>One example of this is focus, or being “in the moment.” This is something I often struggle with. My mind is hyperactive. It’s always chewing on something, which can be incredibly distracting. Worse yet, my mind is often obsessing over unhelpful things. I worry about that awkward disagreement I had with my coworker. What were they thinking? Is this going to be an ongoing problem between us? Or perhaps second-guessing myself. Was that email I sent too hostile? Did I remember to cross off the last TODO before submitting my work? These thoughts come unbidden when I should be paying attention to this meeting, the road, or my yoga class. I feel like I’m being neurotic and too harsh on myself, but worse: I’m <em>not</em> doing the thing I meant to do. I’ve lost control.</p>



<p>What’s going on here? Why do I think what I think? Sometimes I choose to direct my thoughts. Sometimes a trigger in my environment does it for me. Very often, though, my mind is just “wandering.” But what does that mean? MRI studies have taught us a lot, actually. When the mind is idling, there are a few specific brain regions that activate in a distinctive pattern, which is generally consistent across people and cultures. From the inside, it feels like the mind cycles through a few common modes of thought, checking which ones have something to say right now. Sometimes ideas come and go, and sometimes I get sucked into one and lose myself in rumination. It’s a bit like flipping through TV channels to see what’s on. Neuroscientists call this the Default Mode Network, or DMN. It’s part of how the brain is built–part of our human programming. When our minds are idle, performing some rote activity, or unable to hold focus, “wandering” is just what they do.</p>



<p>I came to understand the DMN much more clearly when I realized its connection with meditation. For many years, I thought I sucked at meditation. Like many people, I found it difficult to sit in stillness and think of nothing. It seemed ridiculous to devote hours to this practice just so I could… clear my mind? What’s the point of that? My perspective changed when I got into yoga. Rather than doing nothing, I was doing <em>something</em>: moving, balancing, breathing, paying close attention to my body. Rather than clearing my mind, I practiced feeling the subtle, reciprocal interactions between body and mind. I could see it improve my mood, my health, and my posture, so the value was clear. I also found it to be much easier for me than other forms of meditation (though still challenging, especially once the poses became familiar).</p>



<p>My teachers explained that we all have a “monkey mind,” with a short attention span and a penchant to worry. It’s obsessed with desires, relationships, and critiques. It worries about the past and the present. This isn’t <em>bad</em>, it’s merely human. We can’t just stop doing it, and that’s totally fine. That isn’t the purpose of meditation. Most of the practice is to watch and learn. As I did that, I recognized the connection with neuroscience. The “monkey mind” is just another name for the DMN, and meditation is a way to study it. When does it kick in? What does that feel like? Where does my mind tend to go when it wanders? How can I notice when a thought is off topic? What is it like for that thought to persist, expand, and fill my mind? Can I notice that happening, intervene, and dismiss the thought before it fully blossoms?</p>



<p>In some meditative traditions, the explicit goal is to completely clear the mind and dwell in stillness. That’s totally possible, but it takes years of devoted practice, and it’s definitely <em>not</em> my goal. I see the DMN as pretty useful, actually. It’s nature’s way of ensuring that I reflect on the things going on in my life, the health of my relationships, my plans for the future, and the quality of my work and decisions. My brain automatically notices when it’s under-utilized, and finds ways to fill that space with something which might be useful. I often enjoy it, and it’s often productive. The only problem is when I spend too much time ruminating, or when the thoughts turn toxic, fixating on my faults, wild speculations, and things I cannot change. I want to avoid that, and mindfulness helps me do so.</p>



<p>I used to identify very strongly with my mind. My thoughts were all I had. They were <em>me</em>. I believed that every thought was an important expression of myself, and that I <em>had</em> to listen because the thoughts were in control. It almost seemed like, if my mind went quiet, I would cease to exist. For me, the value of meditation was in shaking off this mindset. I am not my mind. I <em>have</em> a mind. It feels good to merely exist in my body, with no thoughts at all, even if that rarely happens. When my DMN stirs up thoughts, I needn’t attend to them if I don’t want to. That constant churn of semi-random ideas is how my brain provides the raw materials of thought. Sometimes it’s important or insightful, but often it’s just noise. I find it useful to check in now and again: what am I thinking? Does it serve me right now? If not, can I let it go? If the thought is too stubborn, perhaps I should act on it. Is there something I could do right now to quickly resolve it and move on?</p>



<p>What do you think? Does my experience resonate with you? How do you feel about going on autopilot, and having your mind wander? Do you resist it or embrace it? Does it do more good or harm? Are there other aspects of how the mind works that you’d like me to explore on this blog? Let me know in the comments.</p>
