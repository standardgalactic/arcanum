<p>(I took this post’s photo at the Star Trek Original Series Set Tour in Ticonderoga, New York. It’s a view of the warp core of the USS Enterprise, which is only a few feet deep but looks much larger thanks to forced perspective. The room is filled with structures with complicated geometric shapes, technical looking panels, and dramatic lighting in red, blue, and purple.)</p>



<p>In my last post, I wrote about my latest research project and why I was so excited to present it at GECCO, the premier conference for evolutionary computation. I promised a follow-up, and here it is! Unfortunately, I didn’t make it to Melbourne. Instead, I had a very complicated and protracted battle with my University’s travel planning system, United Airlines, and the Australian visa office, all from the comfort of my home in Vermont. I couldn’t even participate in the event remotely, because of the time zone difference. This is all very disappointing, but I tried to make the best of it. I’ve been busy with the next iteration of this project, and enjoying a bit of “staycation” time here in New England (hence this month’s cover photo).</p>



<p>In any case, my paper <em>did</em> get published, and I’d still like to share the materials I presented virtually at the conference. It’s mostly intended for a technical audience, but I hope at least some of my readers will find it interesting. The paper is titled <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638530.3654259">A Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm for Co-evolving Genotypes and Genotype / Phenotype Maps</a>, and is available for free online. I had to cut it down to just four pages, since it was accepted as a poster, so I also wrote up an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-prototype-results/blob/main/ANALYSIS.md">extended analysis of my results</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/ngaylinn/epigenetic-gol-v1/blob/main/README.md">hoverview of my algorithm&#8217;s implementation</a>,  for those who want to go deeper. There&#8217;s also a digital version of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3x58W46RPuXOkqY6NavS6ndpeaEgiZB/view?usp=drive_link">poster</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ej09sxSULmzwNd65EPQInTUySmsUtiq/view?usp=drive_link">short video</a> overview of my experiment.</p>



<p>I continue to work on this idea, and it is starting to evolve beyond what I presented in that paper. Right now, I’m actively deconstructing and rebuilding the algorithm. CPPNs are an important and well known part of the AI field, so I’m trying to describe precisely how my algorithm is different, and which of those differences account for the remarkable results I found. Originally I thought of this research as being about epigenetics specifically, but as I try to generalize and simplify, what I’m left with looks like straight-up endosymbiosis. I’ve been thinking of this algorithm as a metaphor for a cell and its genes / nucleus, but it could just as easily be a metaphor for an animal and its community of microbes. This is exciting, since I’d love to do more research on endosymbiosis, and I really like the idea that perhaps symbiosis is the driving force behind intelligence as we know it, fundamentally changing the dynamics of evolution.</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s how I see it for the moment, and where I hope my research will lead in the near future. For now, though, I’m wrapping up my summer with a few more fun outings, and preparing for the start of classes later this month. I’ll be diving deep into both evolutionary computation and deep learning, which I’m really looking forward to.</p>

<p>One thing that fascinates me about life on Earth is that it’s all built with proteins and genetics. Every living cell, even the most primitive microbe, has at its core a universal molecular-scale 3D printer, controlled by an evolved programming language, which gets read and error-corrected from a highly stable gigabit-scale molecular data storage medium (DNA).</p>



<p>In short, every living thing, every single cell, is a mechanism of astonishing complexity and sophistication, and they <em>all</em> share a common design. That’s wild. Life could not have started that way. The very first cells <em>must</em> have been much simpler and then evolved to be like this. But then… where are they? What happened to those pre-genetic cells? We’ve never found them. There are a few good answers to why, and I find them all fascinating.</p>



<p>One interesting possibility is that pre-genetic life is long gone. After all, it originated billions of years ago! Earth is a hostile place, and those early life forms must have been even more fragile than the ones we see today. Not to mention, there’s nothing life likes more than to <em>eat</em> other life. If “modern” cells with genetics outperformed their more primitive cousins, maybe they drove them extinct and replaced them?</p>



<p>Or, perhaps pre-genetic life never existed on this planet at all. Maybe the mechanism of genetics is so complex it needs much more time to evolve from scratch. Maybe the process got started elsewhere in the universe, and then got deposited here in cosmic debris. In that case, genetic cells just <em>colonized</em> Earth and adapted to living here. That’s an exciting possibility, because that might mean there’s more life “out there,” and we could find other living planets like our own.</p>



<p>Just as fascinating is the idea that pre-genetic life is still alive and well on this planet. That universal 3D printer for proteins is an incredibly powerful tool for cells, but its primary value is exploration. It makes it possible to invent new molecules and thus new lifestyles. It enables life to spread, complexify, and settle every corner of this planet.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t make the cell any better at living <em>one particular</em> lifestyle. It may be that cells evolved diversity to escape the dominance of the first life forms, that cornered their particular niche so well that finding a new niche was the only option. Perhaps genetics was invented to escape and branch out from this overcrowded primordial environment. If that’s the case, then maybe there’s a thriving colony of pre-genetic life, still clinging to a hydro-thermal vent somewhere, just as it has for billions of years. It’s terribly unlikely, but in theory, we could find it. How exciting would that be?</p>



<p>But what if pre-genetic life isn’t rare at all? What if we just can’t see it? Certainly, if it exists, it would be microscopic, and that already makes it very difficult to find and study. We’ve been cataloging single-celled organisms for centuries now, yet we’ve observed just a tiny fraction of them, and gene sequenced even fewer.</p>



<p>Maybe we overlook pre-genetic life because it looks like “normal” cells? We can now take a census of whole microbial communities by sequencing their DNA in bulk and using a computer to sort out the different species, but pre-genetic life would be invisible to that technique. It has no DNA to catalog. Maybe it uses RNA, which degrades more quickly, and is harder to study? Maybe the RNA is organized differently, in ways that would defy current sequencing technology? Maybe it uses a completely different mechanism, with molecules we don’t even know to look for? It’s fascinating to think there could be a whole other kingdom of life hiding in plain sight.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>There&#8217;s been a recent bout of people talking about free will and determinism. Perhaps because of Sapolsky&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58902324-determined">Determined</a>?</p>



<p>But so much of the discussion I see is grounded in a very strange conception of free will. For many people, “free will” means that a mind must have the power to bypass causation and alter reality purely because it wants to, without any external influences.</p>



<p>This is very silly. It&#8217;s secret dualism. It&#8217;s like saying free will only exists if my transcendent soul can reach into the universe (from outside?) and arbitrarily tinker with physics. Science tells us that this sort of free will does not exist. But rather than throw out the concept entirely, maybe we just need a better definition?</p>



<p>When talking philosophy, it’s so important to establish good definitions.</p>



<p>If the Universe is determined, then so are we. We can’t break the laws of physics. In some sense our behavior is <em>unchangeable</em>. We make choices, but if you re-ran the Universe in precisely the same way, we’d act the same every time.</p>



<p>But so what? Even this kind of decision is real and meaningful. We choose based on our experiences and our preferences. Those aren’t in our control, but they’re still “us.” Those choices matter. They determine how the Universe unfolds, and what experiences we all have. We really do make things better or worse, as we choose.</p>



<p>Maybe we don’t <em>change</em> reality. Maybe it was always gonna be this way. But so what? The Universe is vast and chaotic. Even if it’s <em>theoretically</em> predictable, practically it’s <em>not</em>. It’s pure fantasy to think we can accurately predict even a single person’s actions beyond the next few moments.</p>



<p>Even if we’re determined: we experience, we consider, we choose, we act, and that determines what comes next. That feels like “free will” enough for me.</p>



<p>The point of Sapolsky’s book is that we are animals, with innate biases and limitations. We live in a society that determines how we live our lives. We have experiences that shape us. We shape our selves, but only the parts that <em>aren’t</em> determined by reality. We can’t take “full credit,” because so much is just luck.</p>



<p>So where do we get off torturing people in prison for being “evil”? People aren’t evil. People can be selfish, delusional, psychopathic, traumatized, desperate, etc. Maybe they need help. Maybe they’re dangerous to themselves or others. Maybe society should intervene. But to a large extent they didn’t <em>choose</em> that life, but were forced there by circumstances beyond their control. So when we intervene, why the nastiness? Why should we <em>punish</em> someone for being born with a genetic mutation, or an abusive father?</p>



<p>I’m not sure I completely agree with Sapolsky, but he makes a good point worth considering. I don’t want people to reject it because “free will” doesn’t mean what they think it means.</p>
