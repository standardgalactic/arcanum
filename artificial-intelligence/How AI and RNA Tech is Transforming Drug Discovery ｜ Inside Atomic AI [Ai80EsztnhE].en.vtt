00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.960
CRAIG
Why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.200
don't you go ahead and start by introducing&nbsp;
yourself, then we'll get into some questions?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.040
RAPHAEL
Yeah. So briefly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.160
I'm Raphael Townshend, founder and CEO at Atomic&nbsp;
AI. My background is really coming more from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.200
AI space. Originally, I did my undergraduate at&nbsp;
UC Berkeley in electrical engineering and computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.240
science. I started my PhD working in&nbsp;
computer vision but fairly quickly, actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.640
transitioned- this was at Stanford, into working&nbsp;
on structural biology applications specifically.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.080
So taking a lot of the tools that had made such&nbsp;
a difference in computer vision with things like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.800
self-driving cars or in natural language&nbsp;
processing, with things like ChatGPT, seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.920
if we could apply them now to the field of biology&nbsp;
and especially the structural biology space that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.040
was talking about. It's really about understanding&nbsp;
the shapes of molecules, kind of understanding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.160
shapes so you can better understand what they do.&nbsp;
So I started working in that space. A seven-year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.000
PhD later- of banging my head against those kinds&nbsp;
of problems, I really started getting some good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.600
success; including, I guess, what would be the&nbsp;
founding work of Atomic, which was basically this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.200
highly accurate predictor of the three-dimensional&nbsp;
structure of RNA molecules known as AlphaFold for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.080
RNA, which was a big breakthrough in the space&nbsp;
recently. So that work ended up featuring in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.320
cover of Science in late 2021. From there, I&nbsp;
really started Atomic to continue leveraging and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.660
developing those kinds of technologies to really&nbsp;
enable this next generation of RNA drug discovery.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.880
CRAIG
And when you say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.320
AlphaFold for RNA, were you following&nbsp;
DeepMinds research and applying it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.200
to RNA? Or is it just analogous to what&nbsp;
DeepMind was doing with protein folding?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.600
RAPHAEL
Yeah. So I actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.240
worked on the DeepMind team a few years back&nbsp;
so I'm well familiar with their work as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.840
While there are certainly similarities, there's&nbsp;
also a need to redesign a lot of the algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.880
the AI models from the ground up. So RNA, while&nbsp;
at a high level is a similar molecule to proteins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.640
there's a lot of intricacies that require&nbsp;
custom AI models built. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.480
RNA is a much more flexible molecule&nbsp;
than proteins. So really understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.320
those dynamics of it is a key piece that you&nbsp;
need to build into these kinds of algorithms.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.800
CRAIG
Yeah. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:03.000
the algorithms that you worked on that became&nbsp;
Atomic AI, came out of your work at Stanford,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.840
is that what you said? Or came out&nbsp;
of your work at Google DeepMind?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.720
RAPHAEL
This is out of my work at Stanford,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.960
actually. Before even working at DeepMind I had&nbsp;
already developed the core of these algorithms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.960
that worked quite well on RNA specifically. It&nbsp;
was very cool to be making those breakthroughs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.440
seeing the AlphaFold, for proteins, breakthroughs&nbsp;
happening very shortly thereafter. It was a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.200
interesting time overall, is perhaps one fun&nbsp;
way to put it. The cool sign on the AI side for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.920
RNA is that the amount of RNA data that was&nbsp;
publicly available is much smaller than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.960
amount available for proteins. So you needed to&nbsp;
design some very, sort of bespoke algorithms to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.240
work on the limited data. The original science&nbsp;
paper, for example, was trained on just 18 RNAs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.280
total. So a very small number, right? But you&nbsp;
could see you could do surprisingly well given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.640
that small number. The problem was definitely not&nbsp;
solved. I don't want to claim that it was solved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.280
at that time. That plugged into a lot to what&nbsp;
we're doing at Atomic these days, which is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.080
building upon that advance. But, it really showed&nbsp;
the power of these custom kinds of algorithms.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.600
CRAIG
Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:30.120
For people that don't follow biotech, because&nbsp;
a lot of the listeners are AI people; can you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:40.200
explain very briefly what RNA is, why it's&nbsp;
important in drug discovery- everyone knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.920
that the COVID vaccine was an RNA vaccine&nbsp;
but they don't necessarily understand what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:55.080
that means, and why understanding the shapes of&nbsp;
molecules would be important for RNA therapies?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.440
RAPHAEL
Two great questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:04.560
Craig. I would say first of all, RNA, maybe if&nbsp;
you remember the most basic biology lessons, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.120
central dogma in some ways; we have DNA encodes&nbsp;
the information, which then goes to RNA, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.440
then goes to proteins. For a long time, people&nbsp;
thought of proteins as the workhorses of the cell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.720
the things that did everything and RNA is just a&nbsp;
messenger that codes for the right proteins. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.480
it turns out that view is not quite right. In&nbsp;
fact, there's this vast world of RNA that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.840
kind of doing its own set of functions beyond just&nbsp;
coding for proteins. In fact, there's this really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.800
nice hypothesis, the RNA world hypothesis, about&nbsp;
how all of life was first RNA-based, then DNA and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.000
proteins came afterward. An interesting other stat&nbsp;
that's kind of fun to think about is, if you look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.480
at the human genome, about 1% to 2% of it codes&nbsp;
for protein. So about 1% to 2% of the human genome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.520
becomes proteins but about 80% of the genome&nbsp;
becomes RNA at one point or another. So there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.960
about this huge world of RNA that never even&nbsp;
becomes proteins that we're just barely scratching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:09.200
the surface of. So with all that context in mind,&nbsp;
we've got proteins- seen as the workhorse of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.760
cell. If you look at most drugs on the market&nbsp;
today, they're all going after proteins. It's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.440
seen as the main target. That's been great in many&nbsp;
dimensions but there's been a number of diseases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.800
that have been essentially undruggable at the&nbsp;
protein level. We've been trying to drug it for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.840
40 years and we just can't go after some of these&nbsp;
proteins. And these are really high-value things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.000
There's this one protein called c-MYC that's&nbsp;
involved in 75% of human cancers that we've just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.520
failed to get any drugs to. So the idea is, now&nbsp;
you've got your DNA, goes to RNA, goes to protein;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.840
you go one step earlier in the process and you&nbsp;
go after the RNA that codes for that protein,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.000
for the c-MYC protein. In this way, you're sort&nbsp;
of going after these diseases that were previously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.640
undruggable by increasing the attack surface and&nbsp;
giving yourself new ways of striking at them. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.320
that kind of tells you a little bit about the&nbsp;
RNA and why you care about RNA drug discovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.480
specifically. There's a lot more complexity,&nbsp;
I'm simplifying at some level but that's one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.680
of the key messages there. The other piece of&nbsp;
why you care about the shapes of the molecules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.720
and it's very linked RNA in some ways, but it&nbsp;
also has this much broader kind of potential to;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.320
it's fundamentally about the fact that the&nbsp;
shape of a molecule kind of determines what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.720
it does. Structure determines function, is what&nbsp;
people say. And it's almost too obvious in some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.920
ways. The shape of a bike is important to what it&nbsp;
does. If the wheels of the bike were in the wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.880
place it wouldn't do a very good job moving you&nbsp;
around. Very similarly, the shape of a molecule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.840
is really key to what it does. So you need to make&nbsp;
sure it's all in the right place to perform its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.720
function adequately. So sometimes when there's&nbsp;
a disease you can understand almost by looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.880
at the structure, looking at the physics driving&nbsp;
these things and understand from first principles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.800
what's going wrong. Then you can intelligently&nbsp;
design medicines to solve those issues. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.240
a process known as rational design, which stands&nbsp;
in contrast to the traditional way of doing it;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.200
which is more throwing things at a wall and&nbsp;
seeing what sticks, which is more known as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.880
phenotypic screening- would be the technical term&nbsp;
there. And it's kind of seen as one of the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.040
directions of drug discovery and it's playing&nbsp;
an especially critical role in the RNA space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.520
because there's a lot of things that we need&nbsp;
to really understand from first principles to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.440
design well. So I'll stop there for a&nbsp;
second but hopefully that makes sense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.600
both on the RNA- why that matters to a huge degree&nbsp;
and why the shapes of molecules matter as well.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.280
CRAIG&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:48.320
Yeah. Given that context, can you just describe,&nbsp;
quickly, what the RNA vaccine for COVID was doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:57.540
and how understanding the shape of the&nbsp;
RNA molecule played into that therapy?

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.680
RAPHAEL
Of course. The mRNA vaccines was one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.200
of the first big breakthroughs in this RNA drug&nbsp;
discovery landscape, I think everyone got to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:14.160
that firsthand. Fundamentally, what the RNA side&nbsp;
of things is doing is it's coding for specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.080
protein that is part of the Coronavirus, the spike&nbsp;
protein. So if you remember, you've seen all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.480
graphics, you've got the virus particle and you've&nbsp;
got the spike protein sticking out of it. The RNA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.080
is basically coding for that spike protein but&nbsp;
not the rest of the virus. So then that gets into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.560
your cells, your cells produce a lot of the spike&nbsp;
protein, and then your immune system essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.880
learns to recognize that and says, [Oh, that's&nbsp;
a foreign thing that we've seen], and can train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.560
itself right off the bat to find anything that&nbsp;
presents that spike protein in the future. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.720
then when the real virus shows up, it's already&nbsp;
trained, your immune system is already trained to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.680
knock that down. Now, the part where a lot of the&nbsp;
structural piece comes in is actually for making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:03.200
the next generation of those mRNA vaccines. In&nbsp;
particular, one big issue that's been presented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:10.040
with the RNA vaccines is the need for cold chain&nbsp;
storage. The Maderna or Pfizer vaccines need to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.200
stored at very low temperatures to be transported&nbsp;
around the world. For example, getting that to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:23.040
low-income countries is a challenging proposition.&nbsp;
So what you'd like to do is you'd like to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.080
those vaccines more stable, the RNA molecules&nbsp;
more stable. In that case, what you're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.280
is you're trying to find the shapes that are well&nbsp;
folded, that are more resistant to falling apart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.040
basically more stable overall. So in that way,&nbsp;
you're rationally designing the next generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.440
to be a better version of the first gen. So&nbsp;
there's this nice interplay where there's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.400
sorts of different properties of these RNAs that&nbsp;
you can optimize through that kind of approach.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.520
CRAIG
Yeah. Since I have you explaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:11.400
this stuff, you introduce an RNA molecule and&nbsp;
it then goes to the DNA? Explain the mechanism.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.200
RAPHAEL
Of course. Biology is fascinating at some level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.440
and there's a whole bunch of hidden complexity in&nbsp;
there. Fundamentally in this case, actually, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.920
RNA is not becoming DNA at some point, it's just&nbsp;
staying as RNA. And then your cells machinery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:41.480
there's these other molecules known as ribosomes&nbsp;
that can translate that RNA into proteins for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.080
It’s kind of cool; the ribosomes themselves are&nbsp;
actually mostly RNA molecules. You can kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.960
see how it bootstraps itself. You have these RNA&nbsp;
molecules that are responsible for turning RNA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.760
molecules into proteins. That's kind of one of&nbsp;
the reasons people think that RNA might be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.880
first source of life. So anyways, you've got&nbsp;
these RNA molecules and then these ribosomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.360
come and translate them into proteins, into the&nbsp;
spike proteins. Eventually, the RNA molecules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.520
get degraded and thrown out of your cells but&nbsp;
before that point its produced enough of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.800
spike proteins for your immune system to recognize&nbsp;
them. And sometimes you need a couple of doses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:26.040
That's why there was a couple doses of some of the&nbsp;
COVID vaccines; is because not enough of the of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.760
the spike protein gets produced the first time so&nbsp;
you need a second dose to produce some more of it.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.160
CRAIG
Okay. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:42.440
with Atomic AI, you're designing RNA molecules or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:50.260
you're understanding the shape of existing&nbsp;
RNA molecules? Yeah, talk me through that.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.800
RAPHAEL
Yeah. Another great question, frankly, because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.640
there's kind of these two broad categories of RNA&nbsp;
technologies- is how I think about them. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:05.080
the mRNA vaccine kind of category where it's on a&nbsp;
base, the medicine itself is the RNA. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.920
you're injecting some RNA to your body and it's&nbsp;
producing it. But then there's the other category,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.320
which is RNA targeted, where you're targeting&nbsp;
the RNA that's already in your body. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.040
finding the medicine needs to hit that because&nbsp;
your body, as I said before, 80% of the human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:26.040
genome becomes RNA at some point or another. So&nbsp;
there's a lot of that sitting around. So while you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.760
can actually apply this fundamental technology to&nbsp;
both of these, the RNA-based medicines as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.280
the RNA targeted ones– and what I was describing&nbsp;
about making the vaccines more stable is applying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.600
it to the RNA base piece, we can also apply&nbsp;
our technology to the RNA-targeted piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.400
to understand the shapes of the RNA molecules&nbsp;
already in your body to then go and target those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.760
selectively. That's actually the initial focus of&nbsp;
Atomic AI; is understanding the shapes with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.600
RNAs already in your body, folding all of those,&nbsp;
predicting the shapes of all of those molecules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.240
and then targeting those. But maybe this hopefully&nbsp;
paints the picture of how this technology can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.680
very broadly applicable, because even here you&nbsp;
can see how you could apply it to these two fairly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.520
different RNA technologies but in both cases,&nbsp;
it can make a huge difference in drug discovery.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.560
CRAIG
Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:20.160
And on the COVID vaccine, the vaccine is&nbsp;
introducing RNA molecules into the body.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.520
RAPHAEL
Exactly.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.080
CRAIG
In the targeting RNA that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:34.680
exists already in the body, you're targeting&nbsp;
it to turn certain RNA molecules on and off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.140
or to modify the behavior? What&nbsp;
are you doing with the targeting?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.560
RAPHAEL
Yeah. There's a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.280
range of things you could do there. The thing that&nbsp;
we're fundamentally focused on is, as you say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:52.640
turning it on or off. The easiest thing you could&nbsp;
do in some ways is- a protein that you want to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.200
after, you want to decrease the amount of that&nbsp;
protein, so you go and hit the RNA instead. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.320
you're like, [Let's go and destroy that RNA], and&nbsp;
then there'll be less than the protein and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.400
you'll have gone after this undruggable disease&nbsp;
that you couldn't hit at the protein level.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.200
CRAIG
And why wouldn't you be able to hit at the protein&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:20.040
level? I mean, is it understanding the shape of&nbsp;
the protein or finding molecules? As I understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:29.600
it, the importance of understanding the shape&nbsp;
of a protein is, if you want to find a molecule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:36.960
that will fit into a pocket in the protein, for&nbsp;
example- to prevent the protein from binding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:45.400
to other things. Is it that sort of thing that–&nbsp;
you're looking for a molecule that will fit into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:54.240
the RNA molecule and stop it from functioning?&nbsp;
What exactly are you doing at the shape level?

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.240
RAPHAEL
Yeah. I think you're exactly right; shape is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:04.160
key in both the protein and the RNA level. The big&nbsp;
reason some of these proteins are undruggable is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.320
because they're disordered. They're not actually&nbsp;
adopting any single shape, they're just completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.520
floppy. So they don't present any pockets for&nbsp;
you to hit in the first place. Like this c-MYC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.800
protein that I was talking about, that’s involved&nbsp;
in 75% of human cancers, it's just disordered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.640
There's no pockets for you to go after. So the&nbsp;
idea is, instead, you go after the RNA and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.280
try and hit the shapes at that level instead and&nbsp;
design things. It turns out that understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:39.440
the shapes at the RNA level is really critical&nbsp;
as well, to get molecules that are selective,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.240
basically hitting just that RNA and not a bunch&nbsp;
of other things, and functional- that do the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.620
that you need it to do. In this case, degrade the&nbsp;
RNA or prevent it from making more of a protein.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.240
CRAIG
Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.360 --> 00:18:02.760
And how many RNA molecules exist in the body&nbsp;
and how do you know which ones to go after?

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.440
RAPHAEL
There's far more RNA molecules than there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.240
proteins. If you're saying the number of distinct&nbsp;
kinds of RNA molecules, you'll remember that stat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:17.640
I was talking about, how there's like 80% of the&nbsp;
human genome becomes RNA but only like 2% becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:23.560
proteins. So there's just this vast number of RNAs&nbsp;
and some of them don't even code for proteins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:30.200
they just do other things in your body. We're just&nbsp;
trying to understand, still, a lot of the biology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:38.720
behind those. If you just think about the ones&nbsp;
that code for proteins for a second, the mRNAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.920
the messenger RNAs- that's what that stands for-&nbsp;
the ones that code for the proteins, then there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:51.800
hundreds of 1000s of those, of distinct kinds of&nbsp;
mRNAs there. So that's just one small piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.500
the RNA world but it already presents this huge&nbsp;
possibility of potential targets to go after.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.080
CRAIG
Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:10.840
And in the case of the COVID vaccine,&nbsp;
they identified the mRNA that created the—

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.480
RAPHAEL
The spike protein,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:20.600
exactly. You're exactly right. But then there's&nbsp;
other kinds of RNA. There's non-coding RNA;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:29.160
RNA that doesn't code for proteins are known as&nbsp;
ncRNA. Or there's rRNA, which is ribosomal RNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.680
There's all these different categories,&nbsp;
and kind of fun- people just stick little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.160
letters in front of RNA or after the word&nbsp;
RNA to indicate these different categories.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:44.880
CRAIG
Right. Is Atomic AI's mission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:53.520
to define the shape— as has been the case with&nbsp;
AlphaFold- they just came out with AlphaFold 3,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.120
RAPHAEL
Yeah, very exciting,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.000
CRAIG
to define the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:13.120
shape of all of the existing mRNA molecules?&nbsp;
Or, are you selecting certain mRNA molecules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:24.240
that you know are related to certain diseases&nbsp;
and just focusing on understanding their shape?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.800
RAPHAEL
I mean, the long-term dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:33.120
is really about building a map of every RNA that&nbsp;
exists as well as enabling the design of new RNAs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:40.160
that we've never seen before. You've sort of seen&nbsp;
what AlphaFold can do in the protein landscape;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.320
people are using it for all sorts of things.&nbsp;
The idea is to bring that revolution to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.280
RNA space as well. One simple way I think&nbsp;
about Atomic, it's like, we're trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.200
combine that big RNA breakthrough with the&nbsp;
COVID vaccines. And there's been a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.880
other RNA technologies that have come to fruition&nbsp;
in the last few years, with the AI breakthroughs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:05.640
like the AlphaFolds of the world. So there's that&nbsp;
dream in the long term. Our immediate focus is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:12.560
on going after very specific RNAs and showing the&nbsp;
potential on a few test cases first. Showing like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.280
[Hey, you can do this here to get to this&nbsp;
point and design these new drugs that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.580
very exciting.] That then paints the map of&nbsp;
what you can do in a much broader landscape.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.240
CRAIG
Yeah. And we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.760
talk about the AI behind it in a minute but&nbsp;
what are the targets that you're focused on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:42.240
right now? I mean, you mentioned this c-MYC&nbsp;
protein. Is that one that you're working on?

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.040
RAPHAEL
So we haven't disclosed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.600
our targets, are specific ones at this point, but&nbsp;
I would say they very much fall in that category.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.920
There's a number of these undruggable protein&nbsp;
targets that you're trying to hit at the RNA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.720
level instead. And a number of these targets&nbsp;
are in the cancer space- is a big area that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:08.720
we're looking at. I can continue using c-MYC&nbsp;
as an example actually but it's a stand-in for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.200
many other possible proteins you could use.&nbsp;
That's essentially known as a transcription&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.760
factor. It regulates how much of every other&nbsp;
protein is made. So you get too much c-MYC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.200
you get too much of every other protein, you&nbsp;
get uncontrolled replication of your cells,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.280
you get cancer; so you really want to decrease&nbsp;
the amount of it. There's many proteins like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.400
this so you really just want to decrease the&nbsp;
amount of it to control cancer spread. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:40.920
one big area of focus. The second big area is&nbsp;
neuroscience, diseases like neurodegenerative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.800
diseases basically. So think about things&nbsp;
like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's in that case.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.400
CRAIG
Right. Where,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:58.440
again, you're attacking the RNA that builds&nbsp;
the proteins that are causing the disease.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.720
RAPHAEL
Exactly

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.280
CRAIG&nbsp;

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:10.520
At the therapeutic level, if you understand&nbsp;
the shape of those RNA molecules and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:20.520
create a molecule that interrupts that&nbsp;
mRNA molecule, do you then just inject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:31.040
the therapeutic into the bloodstream and&nbsp;
it finds the mRNA? How does that work?

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.760
RAPHAEL
It's a great question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.880
So the technology– what you could use to target&nbsp;
the RNA, there's a whole bunch of different ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:45.280
you could do that, different modalities, is what&nbsp;
people call those. The one that we're focused on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:53.640
today is small molecules. Small molecule is like&nbsp;
20 atoms, whatever; they're small basically. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.000
it's very easy for them to get around and&nbsp;
in your body is really the key thing there;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.480
delivery is easy. It's really classic, any drugs&nbsp;
on the market or small-molecule drugs, most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.760
them target proteins but we're doing RNA-targeted&nbsp;
small molecules basically. The nice thing about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.600
these is you can oftentimes just take them orally,&nbsp;
you can just take them as a pill. That makes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:23.320
really easy and then you can get across your&nbsp;
body in different ways. So you've seen a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:30.200
of these new technologies like the mRNA vaccines&nbsp;
or others where you need an injection or sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:36.840
you even need a surgery or something like that&nbsp;
to get them. The beauty of this kind of approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.560
is that you can then bring that back to just&nbsp;
being a pill that you can take again and you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:48.040
going after these diseases that you don't really&nbsp;
have other nice ways of hitting them otherwise.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:53.040
CRAIG
Yeah. We spoke about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:02.440
Insilico and I've interviewed Alex Z.; I won't&nbsp;
try and remember how to pronounce his last name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:11.320
on the program but they're looking at the&nbsp;
universe of molecules, small molecules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:19.760
and trying to narrow the search space based,&nbsp;
as I understand it, on the properties of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:34.520
molecules before putting them into trials. So&nbsp;
you raise your potential success rate at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:45.440
trial level? Are you talking to them at all? It&nbsp;
seems like this would be a more precise way of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:52.520
narrowing the search space if you understood the&nbsp;
shapes of the molecules. Or, are they doing that?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.480
RAPHAEL
Yeah, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.640
I haven't talked to Alex recently or anything. I&nbsp;
mean, there's this huge space of exciting groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.920
pushing these kinds of approaches, I would say.&nbsp;
I think they are very much using AlphaFold-like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:12.320
approaches as well. I believe I've seen that&nbsp;
work but at the protein level primarily because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.640
AlphaFold for proteins already exists and has&nbsp;
been handed out to the world, and everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:24.840
can use that for what they have. I think that&nbsp;
there's this recognition across the field that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.400
[Oh, understanding the shapes of these molecules&nbsp;
is really powerful and can let us do a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.920
things.] From our standpoint, we're trying to&nbsp;
make the same thing happen in the RNA space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:43.080
again. I can say, I don't know about Insilico&nbsp;
medicine specifically, but I can tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.240
firsthand, there's a lot of groups that are&nbsp;
quite interested in understanding the shapes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:54.560
of RNA molecules to make this dream of rational&nbsp;
design happen there as well. I definitely think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.200
there's a recognition across the field that these&nbsp;
AlphaFold type approaches, these rational design&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.260
type of approaches are really the next wave, the&nbsp;
next generation of these kinds of approaches.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:15.000
CRAIG
Yeah. So now, the AI behind Atomic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:29.840
I interviewed Oriol Vinyals on the program about&nbsp;
AlphaFold. It was maybe a year or two ago. To my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:40.160
understanding, it was an extension of their&nbsp;
work in AlphaZero, where it's a combination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:53.440
of search and reinforcement learning to come&nbsp;
up with, sort of, candidates. Then they had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:08.040
second system that ranked the candidates and then&nbsp;
would narrow that further for testing. Is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:15.040
essentially what you're doing with RNA? Why don't&nbsp;
you walk us through the system that you've built?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.320
RAPHAEL
Of course. So some of the initial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.080
systems were very much along those lines, like&nbsp;
three or four years ago, I would say, you create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.840
a bunch of candidates and then you rank them&nbsp;
using the scoring functions. I think since then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.120
we've actually dramatically overhauled a lot we've&nbsp;
built, and to be fair, a lot of the field has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.760
moving in this direction more generally. And we've&nbsp;
been building these big transformer-based models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.640
first of all, these things that have made such a&nbsp;
big difference in the power of technologies like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:50.040
ChatGPT. Then we've used those to directly&nbsp;
generate the structures of these molecules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:57.000
through these generative AI approaches, might&nbsp;
be one way to think about that. So in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.920
you can just take an RNA sequence and it directly&nbsp;
can produce a three-dimensional structure or even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.320
a set of 3D structures if you think that it's&nbsp;
dynamic and might adopt different shapes over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:17.480
time. So that piece has been very interesting.&nbsp;
Part of what we've needed to do to enable that is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.960
these transformer base models are very&nbsp;
data-hungry. You couldn't really do the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.080
18 data point thing we did before, where you only&nbsp;
trained on 18 RNA structures to build this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.240
thing. But, we recognize that it was critical&nbsp;
that we move to those kinds of architectures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.160
for the long run to really crack a lot of&nbsp;
this problem. The other piece of Atomic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.620
I've been talking a lot about the algorithms, is&nbsp;
we also have our own in-house wet labs that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:55.120
use to generate our own data at a very large scale&nbsp;
to train these AI RNA models. In some ways we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.280
these top-tier AI folks working but then we're&nbsp;
also building the right data that's purpose-built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.520
for these kinds of models. And this is really&nbsp;
a broader trend that I'm quite excited about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:11.560
which is this integrated lab, sort of computation&nbsp;
approach, where you have this iterative cycle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:17.120
where you're generating data that then makes&nbsp;
the AI better that can then feed into more data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:24.880
that's more targeted to further improve the AI&nbsp;
to get that, like, virtuous cycle of improvement.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.200
CRAIG
So can we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:40.680
take the example of an undruggable protein-&nbsp;
and you understand the mRNA that generates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.960
I guess- is that the right word?&nbsp;
that protein, or builds that protein,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:55.880
or has the instruction set to create the protein&nbsp;
and you want to interrupt that mRNA molecule. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:06.040
first step then is to understand the shape of the&nbsp;
RNA molecule. So at that point, what do you do?

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.560
RAPHAEL
It's actually quite interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.120
because in theory, you don't need to know the&nbsp;
shape to start trying to go after it. You could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.720
just take your RNA and start throwing molecules at&nbsp;
it and see what happens. In fact, that's what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:26.320
first generation of companies in this space did&nbsp;
about a decade ago, at this point. The issue there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.960
is that the molecules were generally not potent,&nbsp;
first of all. They didn't do what they needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:39.160
to do. It would stick to the RNA but it wouldn't&nbsp;
destroy it or decrease the amount of protein etc.&nbsp;

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.640
On top of that, they're oftentimes not selective.&nbsp;
So they bond to that RNA but they also bond to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:49.360
many other RNAs at the same time. So there's&nbsp;
issues of potency and selectivity. That's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.040
where the shape starts coming into play. Because&nbsp;
you want to find the unique 3D shapes, the unique&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.840
pocket where you could get a molecule to stick&nbsp;
there and then it will. You could optimize it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:06.160
to bind to that location, not others. On top of&nbsp;
that, if there's a well-defined shape somewhere;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.000
nature doesn't waste effort generally. So those&nbsp;
things are generally the pieces that are actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.280
functional and doing something interesting,&nbsp;
versus some generic piece of RNA might not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.960
actually be doing any interesting function.&nbsp;
So shape then becomes critical to get over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:30.880
these barriers of function and cell activity.&nbsp;
To give you an example of what this does then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.480
is you could find a shape in the RNA molecule&nbsp;
that's responsible for keeping it stable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.640
I mentioned stability before, and you can&nbsp;
destabilize that structure with a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.520
molecule. It's kind of like it binds in there&nbsp;
and it makes it less structured, basically.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.440
Then that lets enzymes, other proteins that are&nbsp;
responsible for chopping up this RNA molecule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:56.000
have an easier time to doing so. So you're&nbsp;
destabilizing it, you're more prone to getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.240
chopped up, and that decreases the amount of it,&nbsp;
decreasing the amount of protein- cures cancer.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.240
CRAIG&nbsp;

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:10.520
But how do you discover the shape? I mean,&nbsp;
that's essentially what you're doing, right?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.120
RAPHAEL
Exactly. This actually gets at the reason why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:20.960
folks are so excited about things like alphaFold&nbsp;
in general; because the traditional way that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.400
find these shapes is through these very expensive,&nbsp;
very slow experimental techniques. They have names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:34.200
like X-ray crystallography, or cryo-electron&nbsp;
microscopy, etc. And we could get into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.680
technical details of how they work but really,&nbsp;
the key to remember is that these things can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:45.160
take months or years to solve a single structure.&nbsp;
I have a good friend of mine, he spent his entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:52.280
PhD solving a single protein structure using these&nbsp;
techniques. And these machines, the cheap machines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.720
in some ways, cost millions of dollars. So if&nbsp;
you can take this process that takes months or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:03.000
years to get a single shape and then use these AI&nbsp;
approaches to bring it down to minutes or seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.840
instead, that's a big deal. People really care&nbsp;
about that, basically. So what we're doing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.800
we can, instead of relying on these expensive&nbsp;
techniques and trying to run those over time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:21.840
which over the past couple of decades have solved&nbsp;
maybe a thousand RNA structures total, depending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.480
on how you count. That's actually generous, maybe&nbsp;
it's a couple hundred; you can instead take these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.760
AI approaches and just map out everything at once&nbsp;
and find these interesting structures, you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:38.160
finding the pieces that are folding into nice&nbsp;
pockets that are targetable in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.920
So one way that I talked about what we're doing is&nbsp;
we're essentially taking the space of all the RNAs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:51.480
in your body and identifying which parts of it are&nbsp;
the most structured and targetable through drugs.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.160
CRAIG
Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:04.720
how do you do that? Is there a&nbsp;
library of mRNA shapes already?

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.400
RAPHAEL
You asked me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.960
how you train those kinds of models in the first&nbsp;
place; there's one thing. So there's an existing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.480
library of shapes that have been solved through&nbsp;
these expensive experimental techniques, as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.760
was talking about before. Maybe you have a couple&nbsp;
hundred of those. So that's the starting point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:32.680
that's your gold standard. Now, as I was just&nbsp;
saying, these AI approaches are very data-hungry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.440
in general. And you can get some initial bang for&nbsp;
your buck through being clever on the algorithm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.120
design; that was the initial science paper. But,&nbsp;
eventually you run into the bitter lesson of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.280
you just need more data and more compute&nbsp;
to really get over some of these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:54.200
So this is actually where RNA itself ends up&nbsp;
being quite an interesting molecule because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.640
you can design experiments that are very high&nbsp;
throughput, that give you lots of measurements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:05.600
even parallel for RNA specifically. That's&nbsp;
because you can connect it to DNA sequencing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.560
and the cost of DNA sequencing has fallen off&nbsp;
a cliff over the last couple of decades. So we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.080
can design these experiments that can measure&nbsp;
tens of millions of RNAs in a single shot. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.960
let me explain how one of these techniques works&nbsp;
just to paint the picture for a second. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:28.240
have your RNA molecule and you expose it to a&nbsp;
chemical and that chemical will go and nip the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.440
RNA at different points, it'll kind of damage it,&nbsp;
basically. Then you can convert that pretty easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.400
back to DNA. Then you can run it through your&nbsp;
DNA sequencer and the parts that got damaged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.720
basically, will show up as mutations in the DNA&nbsp;
sequencer. It'll be errors in the DNA sequencer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.760
So now you can very easily pick up where these&nbsp;
chemicals damaged the RNA molecule. The key is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.440
that the places where it gets damaged are&nbsp;
very linked to the shape of that molecule.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.880
One very simple way of thinking about it is that&nbsp;
the outer parts of the RNA are going to get more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:07.800
damaged than the inner parts. So now you've got&nbsp;
these measurements that are telling you something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.880
about the structure of these RNA molecules. And&nbsp;
because it's DNA sequencing link, you could just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:19.040
run this in parallel on a huge number. On top of&nbsp;
that, it's actually really easy to make at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.920
shorter RNA molecules at a very large scale.&nbsp;
This process known as oligo synthesis, lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.960
you just do it synthetically and create, like,&nbsp;
millions of them at once. Versus for proteins, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.800
can’t actually sequence those. You can't run those&nbsp;
through DNA sequences very easily. On top of that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.240
making them is harder, you kind of have to have&nbsp;
the cells produce the proteins for you. So in some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.800
ways, the fact that we're operating at the RNA&nbsp;
level makes this job easier because you can make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:53.200
and measure the RNA molecules at a much higher&nbsp;
throughput than you ever could for proteins.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.440
CRAIG
And can you then model the RNA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.840
shape in a visualization the&nbsp;
way that you can with AlphaFold?

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.400
RAPHAEL
Exactly. So you end up with a shape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:14.560
of an RNA molecule. I can even show you sound or&nbsp;
something like that. How I would think about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:20.360
is- an RNA is just made of atoms at the end of the&nbsp;
day, like a protein or anything else and it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.960
the atoms in 3D space. It's like, okay, you've&nbsp;
got a carbon over here, you've got a nitrogen over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:34.680
here and they're bonded together, right? So you&nbsp;
can look at those and you can sort of see how it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:39.800
structured. You can even start simulating them,&nbsp;
you could just run the laws of physics on that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.580
That's another process that's super interesting&nbsp;
and can tell you how it flops around over time.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.360
CRAIG
And then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:57.440
to create the small molecule to bind&nbsp;
to the RNA, once you understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:06.040
shape of the RNA molecule, do you search&nbsp;
through some search space for an existing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:15.880
molecule that has a corresponding shape? Or,&nbsp;
do you then synthesize a unique molecule?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.440
RAPHAEL
Yeah. I mean, there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.440
number of different ways you could do it. One of&nbsp;
the common ways is really this process known as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:29.320
docking basically, where you've got the shape and&nbsp;
you're just trying different molecules and saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:36.520
[Do they fit? Does it interact physically&nbsp;
well with the other molecule?] So you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.360
search for these very large spaces of possible&nbsp;
molecules, including things that have never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.640
been synthesized before and then say, [This&nbsp;
one looks good. Let's go and make this one],&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.480
then actually test it in the lab. The idea is,&nbsp;
you're kind of searching through this massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.600
space and then narrowing it down. That's one&nbsp;
common way. There's a few different ways you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.000
could use these things but fundamentally,&nbsp;
you've got the shape, you understand what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.800
you're trying to go after, and then you're trying&nbsp;
to find molecules that interact with that shape.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:06.560
CRAIG
Which do you do, which does Atomic do?

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.760
RAPHAEL
So we do a lot of this docking type of approach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:14.560
as I mentioned, fitting the molecules in there.&nbsp;
Then we combine that with more traditional kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.840
of screening methods as well, which once you've&nbsp;
identified where the shape is, you could just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:27.440
isolate that shape and then you can throw a bunch&nbsp;
of molecules in a lab setting at it as well. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.640
generally, we apply both of those techniques&nbsp;
together, the joint computational experimental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.440
piece. You can even combine those together&nbsp;
because if you've run it in the lab, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:42.380
then feed that back into your AI and do a better&nbsp;
job of docking, for example, the next time around.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:48.360
CRAIG
Yeah. You were talking about transformer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:48.360 --> 00:42:00.820
models. So this isn't search and reinforcement&nbsp;
learning, you're generating molecule shapes.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.560
RAPHAEL
Exactly

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.520
CRAIG
And then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:11.760
if you find one that computationally seems&nbsp;
to fit, then you synthesize it and test it?

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.040
RAPHAEL
Yeah. You get to some RNAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.080
you generate their shapes, you screen&nbsp;
small molecules against it computationally;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.160
if something looks promising, you go and&nbsp;
synthesize that, you test that first in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.440
cells and then in animals and you keep&nbsp;
pushing towards the clinic on that front.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.840
CRAIG
Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:36.120
Then eventually into human trials, I presume?

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120
RAPHAEL
Exactly

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.880
CRAIG
Where are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:43.880
you in that whole process? Where is Atomic today?

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.440
RAPHAEL
It's actually an exciting time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:52.440
for Atomic because we're just starting to test&nbsp;
in animals for the first time here. I would say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.120
it's still what I call the preclinical place.&nbsp;
We're definitely early stage in many ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.520
but this is really the first time that&nbsp;
we're going beyond cells. We've seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.560
our technology work well within cells and&nbsp;
now we're trying to get the next layer up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.680
the next higher-level organism in some ways,&nbsp;
and really putting a lot of the platform to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.320
the test. And we're anticipating getting a lot of&nbsp;
that initial data in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.360
Personally, it's a cool moment because I've&nbsp;
been working in the space for ten-plus years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:31.980
at this point, and it's like, okay, the dream&nbsp;
is starting to become a reality in some ways.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.960
CRAIG
Yeah. I haven't looked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:49.800
at AlphaFold 3 yet. I just saw the announcements.&nbsp;
What's different with AlphaFold 3? And, are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:58.600
adopting whatever changes they made in AlphaFold–&nbsp;
I've forgotten, did you call it AlphaFold RNA, or?

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.640
RAPHAEL
Our core model is known as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:08.720
ATOM-1. It's an RNA foundation model is what we&nbsp;
call that. I should plug the name a little bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:18.200
I suppose. I think we're pretty excited about&nbsp;
AlphaFold 3 overall. I think this space as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.440
whole has been moving really quickly. There's&nbsp;
always these new advances coming from different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.320
groups. And you always make sure you read through&nbsp;
the papers and understand and integrate the pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:33.360
that are useful from these different advances. I&nbsp;
think the key that's happened with Alpha 3 is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:39.000
they've expanded their modeling from just proteins&nbsp;
to much broader states of molecules. That includes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.840
RNA as well, to be clear. And they've seen some&nbsp;
pretty good success in at least some of these new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:50.280
molecules in doing this kind of modeling. For&nbsp;
example, they've seen pretty good success at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.840
modeling protein-small molecule interactions,&nbsp;
a little bit more like what Insilico Medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.680
might do, of modeling protein-small molecule&nbsp;
interactions. They've done a pretty good job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:06.280
at DNA or things like that. However, RNA is one&nbsp;
of the areas that still has room for improvement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.480
at least based on their studies, because they&nbsp;
still don't have state-of-the-art as compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:18.040
to more traditional methods there. Fundamentally,&nbsp;
that comes down to the fact that there isn't that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:24.920
much RNA data out there that's public. This is&nbsp;
one of the key bets of Atomic. You can do very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:30.000
well in certain areas where there's a lot of data&nbsp;
but in others, you really need to invest carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.800
in collecting the right kind of data as well. So&nbsp;
I think there's a lot of very useful components&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.440
that have come out of the AlphaFold 3 kinds of&nbsp;
approaches and it's a fun paper to read overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.800
I know a lot of the team members they're quite&nbsp;
well and I'm pretty excited for them. It's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.960
taking those pieces, combining it with the data&nbsp;
that we have already that we spent the last three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.280
years collecting in-house to really try and create&nbsp;
these continued breakthroughs in the RNA space.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.120
CRAIG
Yeah. How many RNA molecules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:15.720
have you modeled successfully, to the point that&nbsp;
you can synthesize molecules that will fit or bind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:24.520
with them whether or not there's therapeutic&nbsp;
interaction? How many have you done so far?

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.640
RAPHAEL
Yeah, it's a super interesting question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:34.240
I would say, there's different levels of&nbsp;
validation you can do. You can make the molecules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:40.640
and then you could test them in certain ways. One&nbsp;
answer to that is tens of millions or hundreds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:46.520
millions for the highest level validation where&nbsp;
we made these things, and we've tested them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:51.320
found their structures, etc. But then, the&nbsp;
number of things that we're testing in animals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.680
which is several steps later down the process,&nbsp;
we're just getting our first one there. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.640
can think of it as a funnel that’s starting from&nbsp;
this huge number and where each step validation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:09.440
getting smaller and smaller. But, it's the tip of&nbsp;
the spear there. One stat that I like to give is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:16.920
there's a level of accuracy you need to do this&nbsp;
kind of rational design approach. It's like, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:21.640
want your structure to be this close to correct&nbsp;
for you to be able to model the interactions with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.560
a small molecule that could bind there. If your&nbsp;
pocket is completely wrong, it's not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:34.600
really help. What we've seen over the last couple&nbsp;
of years is that on average, the structures that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:40.120
we're making are sufficiently accurate now to be&nbsp;
able to do that rational design kind of approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:47.160
I'm not saying that they all can do it but the&nbsp;
original science paper that we put out, maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:52.840
it was like 5% or 10%. Don't quote me on that, I&nbsp;
don't remember the exact number but it was a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:59.960
number basically, a relatively small amount there.&nbsp;
But since then, over 50% of those structures are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.200
now sufficiently accurate to do this kind&nbsp;
of approach on, which personally is the Holy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.640
Grail in some ways, as far as I'm concerned. It’s&nbsp;
like, [Wow, we can actually use this reliably.]

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.440
CRAIG
Yeah. And once you get the process down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:24.840
is it a matter of just running this iterative&nbsp;
loop until you reach a level of accuracy?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.600
RAPHAEL
Exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:41.040
You need the right level of accuracy. And&nbsp;
I don't want to overly simplify either,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.720
you can definitely turn the crank and eventually,&nbsp;
you'll get there. The one thing that's interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.080
and difficult in biotech is that biology is&nbsp;
complicated and there's 1,000,001 things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.200
could go wrong in various ways. You get a molecule&nbsp;
that's very potent and selective, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.720
but if it doesn't circulate well through your&nbsp;
body, then it's not going to do much anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.440
So there's a lot of pieces that you need to&nbsp;
put together. We're not replacing the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:13.520
drug discovery and development process wholesale&nbsp;
here but we're really honing in on some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.240
key aspects, some of the critical bottlenecks&nbsp;
that have hit the field and made those better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.960
We're not replacing animal testing, as an&nbsp;
example, we're not replacing the clinical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:28.440
trials themselves but we are getting to faster,&nbsp;
better molecules to run through those things.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.120
CRAIG
Yeah. And your focus right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:45.120
now is on narrowing to molecules that you can test&nbsp;
or is it on the more general, as you were saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:52.680
the dream is to eventually model all RNA&nbsp;
molecules? Or, are they happening in tandem?

00:49:52.680 --> 00:50:00.040
RAPHAEL
It's really in tandem, in some ways. How I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.680
about it is, you got the long-term bets, then the&nbsp;
midterm kind of things, and the short-term pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:13.240
that we're doing. Especially for science-heavy&nbsp;
company like Atomic, you need that balance because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.840
you want to be looking at that near term of,&nbsp;
[Let's actually show this thing can deliver on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:25.800
promise in some cases but then also enable a much&nbsp;
broader space at the same time.] So we continue to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:31.400
build what I described as RNA foundation models,&nbsp;
collecting these very large data sets to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:38.040
accurate models of RNA structure, of RNA function,&nbsp;
etc; enable RNA design, that's an active area of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.520
research here at Atomic. On the other hand, we're&nbsp;
also advancing our first programs into testing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:50.160
animals narrowing the search space, as you say,&nbsp;
to find those molecules and testing them. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:57.200
think this is a little bit of my own philosophy&nbsp;
as well, which is, you want to be applying the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:04.200
technology that you have or putting it to the&nbsp;
test as much as possible. I'm a big believer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.400
in building the thing that is useful, that will&nbsp;
actually move the needle, as opposed to designing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:15.360
it in isolation and then figuring out how to&nbsp;
apply it. Because I think that by applying it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.360
looking at where it's useful versus not, then you&nbsp;
can guide further efforts in that direction and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:26.560
really build the foundation models that are useful&nbsp;
and that are really going to make a difference.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.600
CRAIG
Yeah. But the activity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:42.560
you've got this animal trial; if it's successful,&nbsp;
do that move into human trials? I understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:50.760
long-term goal but is the company at this point&nbsp;
focused on generating data that then can train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:59.980
better models? Or is it– I guess I asked this&nbsp;
already, is it on coming up with therapeutics?

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.960
RAPHAEL
Yeah. The boring answer is really both,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:09.880
frankly, is what I'm getting at in some ways. And&nbsp;
these two things are very linked, in some ways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.240
actually. I think you're getting at a very&nbsp;
important point, though, because of these first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.760
trials that we're doing, where we're testing in&nbsp;
animals, for example, that's going to generate a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:23.360
small amount of data. And you can only feed that&nbsp;
back in but oftentimes, the kind of data that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.440
really critically useful for training these big&nbsp;
AI models looks fairly different than the data you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:35.360
get out of any given drug discovery program. Maybe&nbsp;
concretely, the way I could paint this for you is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:42.080
that we have a team that's dedicated to generating&nbsp;
data for the AI models specifically. And we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.400
another team that's dedicated to pushing&nbsp;
forward the drug discovery programs. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.800
a lot of cross-interaction, cross-pollination&nbsp;
between those two but there are specific folks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.400
with very specific mandates at Atomic along&nbsp;
both those lines of what you just described.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.820
CRAIG
Yeah. And remind me when did you form Atomic?

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.440
RAPHAEL
Yeah. It's been three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:09.840
that we've been going now. We're like 25 people&nbsp;
today, half AI scientists, software engineers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:19.520
etc, half biologists, medicinal chemists side&nbsp;
of things. I've been saying this “both” thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.680
a lot here and it's fundamentally we're trying&nbsp;
to build this interdisciplinary organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:30.760
that has that expertise across these different&nbsp;
spans. We're also co-located in the Bay Area to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:35.840
enable that interplay and interchange of ideas.&nbsp;
So I fundamentally believe that a lot of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:41.600
key innovation for a place like Atomic happens&nbsp;
in that white space between established fields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.000
in some ways. It's like, you want to build&nbsp;
that new field there at the intersection.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.560
CRAIG
Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:55.640
I was just in DC talking to the director&nbsp;
of the National Science Foundation. How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:05.160
much are you depending on government grants?&nbsp;
This sounds like something the NSF or other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:10.320
government organizations would want to fund.&nbsp;
How much you depending on venture capital?

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.040
RAPHAEL
Yeah. So at this stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:17.360
we're mostly venture capital-based, however,&nbsp;
you're completely right. There's a major&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.000
government angle to this whole thing.&nbsp;
In fact, it's funny that you asked the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.720
question on government; I literally met a&nbsp;
Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.600
talking about AI applications for biotech&nbsp;
specifically and making this argument that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:38.440
some of these large data sets you need to collect&nbsp;
to build these foundation models are like really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:43.040
key. To build the best foundation models&nbsp;
you need the best data sets that require&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.080
sustained investment, long-term investment, the&nbsp;
kind that the US government is uniquely suited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:55.320
to provide. So you're actually hitting on a very&nbsp;
interesting point there, that I think is very much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:01.420
an area of excitement for Atomic and&nbsp;
this AI for biotech field in general.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.760
CRAIG
Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:08.160
I didn't realize that ARPA,&nbsp;
is that how you pronounce it?

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.555
RAPHAEL
Yeah, ARPA

00:55:10.555 --> 00:55:13.840
CRAIG
Now there’s ARPA-H

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.320
RAPHAEL
Right, ARPA-H

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.200
CRAIG
-who’s focused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:25.840
specifically on healthcare applications. I&nbsp;
also didn't realize until this conference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:33.400
that there is a national security commission on&nbsp;
biotech now. Are you involved with them at all?

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.520
RAPHAEL
I haven't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.800
been involved to this date with some of those&nbsp;
discussions I have been involved with others. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.920
would say that the way that I would describe&nbsp;
it is, there's this realization across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:50.520
government in some ways that biotech is a&nbsp;
major area of innovation that needs focused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.640
investment. And I think that the US wants&nbsp;
to continue being the leader on the global&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.240
stage there specifically. So it's thinking&nbsp;
through carefully how to back these kinds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:07.080
of things and how to potentially increase that&nbsp;
investment in there. So I think there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.360
of interesting conversations, I mentioned&nbsp;
the one I had on Monday on this front,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:18.560
as an example. Especially in light of these new&nbsp;
AI applications, you've had these executive orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:27.820
get signed from Biden, the White House, really&nbsp;
increasing the focus on these areas overall.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.480
CRAIG
Yeah. Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:37.380
you have any trouble with funding or is there&nbsp;
plenty of money for initiatives like yours?

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.680
RAPHAEL
I would say AI continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:46.800
to be a very strong space for investment as a&nbsp;
whole. I think the biotech market specifically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:52.960
has been going through a bit of a rough patch&nbsp;
since the pandemic. However, AI for biotech is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.800
the bright spot across that landscape, would&nbsp;
be one way that I think about it. Because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:04.400
it's really showing, [Hey, we've seen what&nbsp;
ChatGPT can do, we've seen what AlphaFold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:10.680
can do.] There's a lot of excitement in some&nbsp;
ways and it's almost like a reverse hype thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.680
is one way to think about it. The people that are&nbsp;
closest to it are oftentimes the ones that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.880
the most excited about the whole thing, which is&nbsp;
kind of cool to see. Especially on the AlphaFold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.000
side of things. ChatGPT, now everyone knows&nbsp;
about that and is excited about that already;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
I don't want to say that that hasn’t gotten&nbsp;
into the public consciousness at his point.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.880
CRAIG
Yeah. To that point–&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.960
and he's on the commission, I can't remember&nbsp;
his name; he’s the founder of Ginkgo Bioworks.

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:39.940
RAPHAEL
Very nice

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:44.800
CRAIG
Yeah, he was saying that he thinks within&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:52.960
two or three years, and maybe it'll be atomic AI,&nbsp;
there's going to be a ChatGPT moment for biotech.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:57.360
RAPHAEL
I would very much agree with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.920
I think that there's going to be some really&nbsp;
exciting developments in the next few years.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.440
CRAIG
Yeah. Is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.080
there anything I haven't asked that I should ask?

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.440
RAPHAEL&nbsp;

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:15.720
I think this was really good. I covered most of&nbsp;
the points that I wanted to hit here; trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:21.400
integrate the wet with the dry lab together&nbsp;
to make that cycle, these RNA breakthroughs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:28.120
why we should care about RNA specifically- is&nbsp;
key, Atomic is really trying to bring RNA and AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:36.229
together to usher in that new generation. I think&nbsp;
we covered it actually, great set of questions.

00:58:36.229 --> 00:58:36.880
CRAIG
I do have one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:48.040
question. What kind of compute demands do you&nbsp;
have? Is there plenty of compute for what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:55.640
need? Again, I had this conversation&nbsp;
with a guy named Brian Spears at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:07.120
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who's&nbsp;
doing work on RNA shape discovery but they've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:16.980
the most powerful computers in the world at their&nbsp;
fingertips. How are you handling compute needs?

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:20.080
RAPHAEL
Yeah. I think we always need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.040
more compute, is really the honest answer. We've&nbsp;
bought a bunch of GPUs that we have on-premise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:31.320
basically. So we always have access to and&nbsp;
that lets us do a baseline of work basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:36.040
over there. And these are H100, basically,&nbsp;
which are like the top-of-the-line GPUs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.040
you really need for this kind of work. On top of&nbsp;
that, we burst up the cloud; when we're doing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:47.760
big training job, then we'd go to AWS, GCP, or&nbsp;
what have you and train is there. Now, the issue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.320
is always getting quota on these things, getting&nbsp;
enough allocation on the cloud providers to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.560
these kinds of things. In theory they have a lot&nbsp;
but you can’t always get access to it if there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.840
lot of folks training at the same time. So we're&nbsp;
always hunting for more computers, is maybe the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:07.120
simple way of putting it. I used to work at the&nbsp;
Department of Energy a little bit during my PhD,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:13.120
using the Summit supercomputer, which is, I don't&nbsp;
know, some ridiculous amount of H100s; and it'd be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:19.760
very nice to just have that at our fingertips at&nbsp;
some level, like 27,000 H100s or whatever it was.
