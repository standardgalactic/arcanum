00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.620
So Damon, why don't you go ahead, introduce
yourself?

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.640
And then sir Rob, you can you can go next.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.059
DAMON 00:43
Hi, I’m Damon Rashid.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.610
My background is, I'm actually an economist.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.380
So I spent the first few years of my life
working for the equivalent of the Department

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.700
of Justice over in the US, in Australia.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.730
It's called the ACCC so, federal regulator.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.150
But in the background, I've always had a fascination
with data, so I've been running sports betting

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.460
models, horse racing models, Greyhound models,
trying to predict the outcome in these competitive

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.380
sectors trying to get an edge over the bookies.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.239
So, you know, my day job was working as an
economist at the regulator and by night, I

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.150
was trying to run models to beat sports betting
and racing markets.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.750
These days, I run a data science team.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.980
We specialize in providing machine learning
solutions, I guess, in where there's difficult

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.980
problems to solve.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.859
We do a lot of consulting for banks, insurance,
companies, universities, road authorities.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.390
So it's been a fascinating journey.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.340
CRAIG 01:46
Yep, and Saurabh, why don't you go ahead?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.219
SAURABH 01:49
Yeah, totally, so I'm a software engineer

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.219
by trade.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:11.250
Back when I did my thesis, like 20, 25 years
ago, it was actually in machine learning.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.359
And back on those days, you had to literally
hand code everything.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.769
So I did my 70,000 lines of code to get that
model working.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:29.738
Then after I did a tech startup, exited to
Telstra, which is like the equivalent of an

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:34.799
AT&amp;T here in Australia, got into sales for
about a decade, got into management, was the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.089
CEO of a publicly listed tech business.

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:48.069
Grew that from about 20 mil to about 100 mil
exited that about three years ago, and then

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.809
stepped in as the CEO of TrialKey about six
months ago now.

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:56.759
CRAIG 02:35
Okay, TrialKey is the new name for Opyl.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.759
Is that right?

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.149
Or is Opyl the new name for TrailKey?

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.088
SAURABH 02:44
Yeah, so Opyl is the company name, and that's

00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:06.019
what we're on the stock exchange.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:07.949
So the ticker code is OPL.

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.248
The actual product that we take to market
is TrialKey.

00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:19.468
CRAIG 02:53
I see, and Damon, you're the CTO for TrialKey.

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:20.468
Is that right?

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:21.998
DAMON 03:01
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:27.729
And we've been working on TrialKey for about
three years now and we've only just got it

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.919
to market probably in the last four weeks.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:36.449
So this is the exciting period where we can
start to get some feedback about our product.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:40.469
CRAIG 03:16
Yeah, do you mind starting Damon, by talking

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.089
about the sports betting, which I find fascinating?

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:49.899
I told you earlier, I had a turn at horse
racing prediction using a supervised learning

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:50.899
classifier.

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.248
What kind of models were you using?

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:54.309
What was the success rate?

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.039
And then how can you relate to what you're
doing a TrialKey?

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.718
DAMON 03:48
Yeah, good question.

00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:04.099
So this is around 2005, that, started building
sports models, and mainly for US sports and

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.189
some international sports like tennis and
golf.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.309
But we were doing National Hockey League,
NBA, you know, NFL.

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:15.189
So, the prediction models at that stage; there
wasn't a lot of competition.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.319
There weren't a lot of, I guess, statisticians
modeling sports back in 2005.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.749
So there was quite an edge over the bookmakers.

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:27.879
So, you could take publicly available data,
you could analyze it using pretty simple models

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.468
back in the day, like you know, traditional
linear probit or logit models.

00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:37.718
You know, even some simple logistic regression,
provided some advantage over the market.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:43.419
But as time went on more and more statisticians
came into the market, data became more readily

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.449
available, and the market became tighter and
tighter and became harder and harder to win.

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.459
So you needed more advanced models.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.328
At that stage, you know, I had other things
on.

00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:55.188
So, sports betting sort of took a backseat.

00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:56.578
And then we started working on this TrialKey
product.

00:03:56.578 --> 00:04:03.419
The way that I see it is that predicting the
outcome of clinical trials, which we'll talk

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:11.769
about in a second, is kind of like sports
betting 20 years ago, there aren't a lot of

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.858
people doing it at the moment.

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.599
It's a very virgin industry.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.689
There are, you know, opportunities here.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:23.119
It's brand new and that surprises me, given
the amount of money spent on clinical trials.

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:24.598
CRAIG 05:31
That's right.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.818
I haven't heard anybody doing this.

00:04:26.818 --> 00:04:36.019
I mean, Saurabh and I had a conversation earlier
about, Insilico, a company that I've had on

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:37.419
the podcast and that I follow somewhat.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.289
They're focused increasing the chances of
a successful clinical trial by narrowing the

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.619
scope of small molecules that they're going
to put into trial; but I don't think they're

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.309
doing any predictions on the clinical trials
themselves.

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.609
Is there anybody doing this, that you're aware
of?

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:55.899
SAURABH 06:19
So there's a couple, I mean, I think Insilico

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.229
are kind of playing in this area.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.879
But you're right, there are a lot more on
the molecule side.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.929
There's another company that we've seen out
of Israel that are talking about doing something

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:07.809
but they haven't launched something to market
yet.

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:12.598
So I think right now, we have first mover
advantage, but it'll be like the sports betting,

00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:15.188
in a couple of years, everybody will be doing
this.

00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:18.129
CRAIG 06:38
Yeah, and what happens, Damon, with the sports

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.129
betting?

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.359
The odds, the more people that do it, it narrows
the odds, so the payoff of a good prediction

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:26.869
is fewer and farther between?

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:33.169
Or is there something else that flattens the
curve and makes the opportunity less attractive?

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.139
DAMON 07:06
No, I think you nailed it there.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:42.279
So it's more and more people, you know, having
predictions and then moving the market, but

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.329
also, the bookmakers themselves have invested
significantly in data science capabilities.

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:51.339
I know one bookmaker, one of the biggest,
that has 50 data scientists working for them,

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:52.339
making predictions.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.589
And also a lot of professional outfits have
what are called private data, where you have

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.839
this publicly available data but for some
sports, like tennis, and soccer, those publicly

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.579
available data sets aren't that detailed.

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:05.929
So they have people watching these events
and coding their own variables and at scale.

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:11.859
And I know, particularly in the UK, some very
successful outfits that have won literally

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:16.969
billions of dollars by creating their own
dataset, ignoring what's publicly available

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.848
and actually hiring resources to create their
own dataset.

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:25.729
CRAIG 08:10
Yeah, and Saurabh, you were talking, when

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:33.878
we spoke earlier, about investing in clinical
trials as an investor; I mean, investing in

00:06:33.878 --> 00:06:43.939
these small pharma companies that are, at
very low— I don't know what the term is,

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:46.949
but their cost of capital is pretty high.

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:54.509
So you can get in fairly inexpensively and
if you predict successful technical clinical

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:00.079
trial, and they are successful, then the value
of the company surges.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:06.748
I can see maybe that opportunity would narrow
as it did in sports betting, as this kind

00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:10.498
of thing becomes more prevalent but the value
of predicting a successful clinical trial

00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:13.008
to the companies remains the same, right?

00:07:13.008 --> 00:07:19.459
I mean, if it saves them time and money if
they know which drug and which protocol is

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:20.889
likely to be successful.

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:21.968
Is that right?

00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:26.229
SAURABH 09:32
Yeah, so, just even a bit more context, so

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:34.139
right now the model that we have can predict
the outcome of a clinical trial with about

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:35.139
90% accuracy.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.348
So we get it right most of the time.

00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:46.429
So if we think about the use cases, I think
totally one is on the investment side because

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:50.568
often, the probability of success is actually
not baked into the share price for a lot of

00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:51.999
these public companies.

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:53.899
Damon and I, we’re one for one, we invest
in a company called Dimerix.

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:56.079
We got in at 10 to 12 cents about two months
ago.

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.839
They announced their successful trial mid
March.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:00.869
Now it's about 30 cents, we've done quite
well out of that.

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:06.629
We probably need to do this 10 more times
just to make sure we didn't get lucky once.

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:12.218
But I think the fundamental theory is, for
one or two drug company, either a success

00:08:12.218 --> 00:08:15.049
or a failure will have a dramatic impact on
their share price

00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:16.049
SAURABH 10:26
So that's one use case.

00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:18.679
The other use case is for the drug company
themselves.

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:23.979
So if they're running the trial, they might
have two or three different options that they're

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:24.979
doing.

00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:30.669
So we can help them figure out what's most
likely going to succeed.

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:36.398
And because it's explainable AI we’ll tell
them what variables to tweak.

00:08:36.398 --> 00:08:44.039
So for example, they might have 700 patients,
but they actually need 900 for this phase,

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.469
for this condition.

00:08:45.469 --> 00:08:55.398
Or they might be using dosage of 25 milligrams,
but the data shows for this condition, 50

00:08:55.398 --> 00:08:56.638
milligrams is better.

00:08:56.638 --> 00:09:07.948
Or they might be doing a cream, but the data
says look, a nasal spray is better.

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:10.319
So all these kinds of nuancing things that
we tried to do, we did this similarly for

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:13.089
another company recently, and we kind of increased
their chance of success to about 30%.

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:16.309
And this is all stuff that's hidden in the
data but people don't know, because the data

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:18.659
set has just gotten so big over time.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.599
CRAIG 11:16
Yeah, and let's back up a little bit.

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:23.659
Sorry, I jumped right in on sports betting.

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:27.949
So drug companies, they spend a lot of money
in hunting for pharmacologically active molecule

00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:32.489
or compound, and then they go through various
animal trials, and then they're, at least

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:37.599
in the United States, I think it's three phases
of clinical trials.

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:39.638
That whole pipeline is very slow and very
expensive.

00:09:39.638 --> 00:09:49.349
So you don't want to spend money on a clinical
trial and have it fail.

00:09:49.349 --> 00:09:54.039
You want to pick your bets very carefully.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.809
And that's what TrialKey does, right?

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:56.809
SAURABH 12:08
Totally.

00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:59.339
CRAIG 12:09
I mean, that's the value proposition.

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:03.349
Can you tell us, what kind of data are you
using?

00:10:03.349 --> 00:10:09.549
What kind of data do you need from companies
to reach that 90% accuracy that you're talking

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:10.549
about?

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:13.999
SAURABH 12:25
Totally, so a bit of context about how we

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:16.078
got the data source.

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:25.609
So what Damon and the guys did, they've sat
down about 400,000 clinical trials from clinicaltrials.gov.

00:10:25.609 --> 00:10:27.839
So all this data is publicly available.

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:32.779
But what took the three years of effort was
to be able to scrape 700 variables off each

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:33.929
of those trials.

00:10:33.929 --> 00:10:40.409
And three months goes by 500, a year goes,
probably about two or 300.

00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:47.208
And we're adding more and more data sets from
those variables and I'm sure Damon can talk

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:51.689
about some of the LLMs that he’s worked
on to help do that.

00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:57.319
But then the fundamental thesis we have is
everything about how humanity interacts with

00:10:57.319 --> 00:11:07.458
drugs and devices, not only of therapies,
is actually known within that dataset of 400,000

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:11.369
trials that have existed in the world.

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:18.279
And all we're doing is pulling out the relevant
variables for every phase, for every condition

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:25.049
and just putting it together, and then using
that as a knowledge set to make future predictions.

00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:27.839
I mean, Damon, anything that would add?

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.929
Yeah, no, that's a good summary.

00:11:29.929 --> 00:11:34.199
So the challenge that we've found was that
the actual publicly available dataset, clinicaltrials.gov,

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:40.049
where most significant trials are registered,
is a really badly curated dataset.

00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:45.749
I was gonna say more nasty things about it
but that's probably the— and the problem

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:51.169
is that there's no real onus for pharmaceutical
companies, drug development companies, etc,

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.309
to report into that database.

00:11:53.309 --> 00:12:00.749
So it turns out that only about 17% of all
trials ever done, we actually know what the

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:02.448
outcome is that have been officially reported.

00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:04.879
Which is, when you think about it, that's
a failure.

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:10.268
It's a data collection failure because, as
Saurabh said, if we know those, the results

00:12:10.268 --> 00:12:17.049
of those trials, it can help in the development
of new drugs, new medicines, new life saving

00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:18.049
interventions.

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:23.619
But because the data is so badly curated,
we've spent three years trying to fix that

00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:27.729
problem and actually generate our own dataset
based off that initial publicly available

00:12:27.729 --> 00:12:28.729
data.

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:32.999
So that's what's taking the time and part
of it is around identifying which trials actually

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:35.739
passed and which ones failed, but also in
the free text that's written generating a

00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:40.759
whole stack of variables using advancements
in natural language processing.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:44.398
As Saurabh mentioned, that technology just
wasn't available two or three years ago with

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:45.398
ChatGPT, etc.

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:49.719
We can extract a huge amount of data from
those clinical trials, the free text within

00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:51.518
those clinical trials, using language models.

00:12:51.518 --> 00:12:54.359
And I don't think anyone in the world has
ever done this before.

00:12:54.359 --> 00:12:56.999
So we're pioneering, and the results and the
insights have been fascinating.

00:12:56.999 --> 00:13:00.739
So when we go out and talk to people in the
industry, they're totally engaged with the

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.539
results that we're providing because they've
never seen this sort of information.

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:05.648
They've speculated on it, but they've never
seen it.

00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:08.179
CRAIG 15:31
Yeah, and when you say that part of the problem

00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:10.089
is identifying which trials are successful,
aren't trials publicly— and I mean, at least

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.799
in the United States by the FDA?

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:14.159
DAMON 15:47
So that's the last step in the process.

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:17.888
So once you've done your three phases, then
you can apply for FDA approval.

00:13:17.888 --> 00:13:25.369
But if you never get to that stage, let's
say you have a phase two trial, and it doesn't

00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:26.369
succeed.

00:13:26.369 --> 00:13:32.349
There's our obligation to report but it's
not really policy, so you don't know the status

00:13:32.349 --> 00:13:33.559
of that phase two trial.

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:37.138
And the trials aren't linked either, a phase
three trial, you don't know what the corresponding

00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:38.709
phase two trial was, in the dataset.

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:39.829
That just doesn't exist.

00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:43.789
And initially, we thought, if a trial wasn't
reported on, we just assumed that it must

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:44.789
have failed.

00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:46.148
But that's not actually the case at all.

00:13:46.148 --> 00:13:50.239
There's many, many trials, 1000s of trials
that actually succeeded but the data was just

00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:51.749
never updated in the public source.

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:56.179
So, that made our job difficult but it was
rewarding to sort of solve that problem as

00:13:56.179 --> 00:13:57.179
well.

00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:00.749
CRAIG 16:41
Yeah, and a certain amount of this data that

00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:08.148
you can get publicly I would guess, is in
tabular form already.

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:09.999
Is that right?

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:18.229
What percentage of the data comes to you structured?

00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:25.138
And then I want to ask about how you extract
data from unstructured text.

00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:30.099
DAMON 17:09
Yeah, so out of the 700 variables, we've got

00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:31.828
probably about 300 are structured.

00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:35.919
That's things like, you know, how many patients
they're looking to recruit?

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:42.879
Or what countries are they in and, you know,
who's involved in the trial, that sort of

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.018
information comes structured.

00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:49.539
There's a lot of structured data, but then
the unstructured data is the fascinating data.

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:54.789
We're talking about things like extracting,
you know, the mechanism of action for a drug

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:59.289
or the actual molecules and compounds themselves,
or it might be, you know, dosage levels, or

00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:04.079
information about the inclusion/exclusion
criteria on a clinical trial, which is, you

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:10.898
know, who could get selected or who can who
misses out on the trial, even the endpoints

00:15:10.898 --> 00:15:15.359
that they're trying to reach, their primary
and secondary goals of the trial, all of this

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:17.518
information is free text.

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:25.469
The only way that you can gain insights from
that data is to take that free text, apply

00:15:25.469 --> 00:15:30.099
a natural language processing model, and turn
it into more structured data that then you

00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:31.829
can run through a model.

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:37.549
So what we've been doing is creating, you
know, the extra 400 or so variables, which

00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:39.999
will increase significantly in the next six
months.

00:15:39.999 --> 00:15:43.979
We've been using language models to create
those variables from the free text.

00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:46.729
The insights from that, it's been, you know,
fascinating.

00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:51.318
Something as simple as, once a patient is
enrolled in a trial, how many touchpoints

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.768
they have with a particular site or hospital.

00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:58.069
That's critical information as to whether
a trial will succeed or fail and those insights

00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:00.869
were unknown before products like TrialKey
came onto the market.

00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:04.369
SAURABH 18:53
And that's fairly nuanced, a variable like

00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:05.369
that.

00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:10.969
If you're doing life saving cancer treatment,
you tend to not need to touch the patients

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:11.969
a lot.

00:16:11.969 --> 00:16:15.938
But if you're doing alternative therapies,
a vitamin based observational study, you tend

00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:20.458
to need to engage with the patients, like,
every couple of weeks.

00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:25.948
That's the real kind of nuanced stuff that
the model has kind of picked up on.

00:16:25.948 --> 00:16:27.078
CRAIG 19:14
Yeah.

00:16:27.078 --> 00:16:33.859
And to extract the data, I imagine a lot of
this is at this point, is prompt engineering.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:34.859
Is that right?

00:16:34.859 --> 00:16:40.518
Where you're working with a large language
model on a block of text and you're asking

00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:45.628
it to first of all surface all the variables
that it can find in the text, is that right?

00:16:45.628 --> 00:16:48.958
And then you decide which of those are likely
to be important?

00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.549
DAMON 19:52
Yeah, so, exactly right.

00:16:50.549 --> 00:16:52.279
So, the prompt engineering is a massive part
of what we do.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:56.559
When speaking with subject matter experts,
and they tell us what they think is important

00:16:56.559 --> 00:17:00.489
around a trial, that enabled us to create
some prompting to try to get that information

00:17:00.489 --> 00:17:03.058
from the unstructured data.

00:17:03.058 --> 00:17:10.649
And then to do that on mass, like to do it
for 400,000 trials and lots of prompting as

00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:17.479
well to extract as much information as we
can, it's a big exercise.

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:27.419
It takes about a month for our servers to
run through and collect that data on 400,000

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:28.419
trials.

00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:31.749
And then, rather than ask assigned weights
to each of those variables that are created,

00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:36.319
we create a model, and then the machine learning
model determines whether that variable has

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:38.038
any impact on the probability of success or
not.

00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:39.928
So the machine learning model applies the
weights.

00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:45.739
So, for a lot of the data we collected, it
had a very minimal impact but some of the

00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:48.639
data is— those variables are incredibly
predictive.

00:17:48.639 --> 00:17:52.009
CRAIG 20:57
And it's not to the point yet, where you can

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:58.668
simply ask a large language model to look
at a drug and a protocol and predict based

00:17:58.668 --> 00:18:04.649
on the weights in its memory, whether or not
that that's likely to be successful.

00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:09.499
I mean, you're using the large language model
to extract parameters.

00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:13.879
And then you're putting those parameters into
a structured format and using a classifier

00:18:13.879 --> 00:18:15.199
essentially, to decide the probability of
success.

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.199
Is that right?

00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:17.199
DAMON 21:38
That's exactly right.

00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:19.459
We actually did try what you just suggested
as well, just to see if the natural language

00:18:19.459 --> 00:18:20.769
models could predict if that was the prompt.

00:18:20.769 --> 00:18:23.528
But the predictions that they came out with,
weren’t very well correlated to our model.

00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:27.089
So I don't think they're at that stage yet
where they can actually add value to the predictions

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:28.548
over and above what our model does.

00:18:28.548 --> 00:18:31.829
I just don't think it's in its realm of capabilities
just yet, maybe one day.

00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:34.439
CRAIG 22:13
Yeah, and then do you also, in the training

00:18:34.439 --> 00:18:35.629
phase, do you feed post-launch data into the
models?

00:18:35.629 --> 00:18:38.459
Because even if a clinical trial is successful,
the drug may not be successful in the marketplace.

00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:41.149
Do you use any of that data?

00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:42.678
DAMON 22:47
Not yet.

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:49.499
That's something that's on our development
horizon, and also working out the probability

00:18:49.499 --> 00:18:51.489
of FDA approval as well there.

00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:53.989
Those two things are in our development horizon.

00:18:53.989 --> 00:18:59.009
We've spent most of our time, so far, predicting
phases one through three of clinical trials

00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:01.469
and haven't looked at a lot of aftermarket
data.

00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:03.829
But yeah, that's definitely a use case for
the future.

00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:06.259
SAURABH 23:14
For now, we're predicting something very narrow.

00:19:06.259 --> 00:19:10.839
We're predicting whether a trial meets its
primary endpoint, which is really, does it

00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:14.759
answer the question that it set out to solve.

00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:20.619
So we're not really predicting whether it's
going to make money or whether it's going

00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:21.819
to be successful.

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:27.939
The other thing that we do use the predictions
for is a competitor analysis.

00:19:27.939 --> 00:19:33.239
So remember that Dimerix trade that we told
you about, that would serve a rare kidney

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:34.239
disease?

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:37.908
So their probability of success was about
55% but they had about a dozen competitors

00:19:37.908 --> 00:19:39.209
trying to solve the same problem.

00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:45.349
But most of those guys had their properties
and like the teens 10, 15 20% success.

00:19:45.349 --> 00:19:50.749
So that's why we invested in them, we saw
them as a real outlier.

00:19:50.749 --> 00:19:54.428
Then the other part of the model predicts
is when they will succeed.

00:19:54.428 --> 00:20:00.819
So you get a nice, almost like a Gantt chart
that says, here you, here are your competitors,

00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:05.788
and these ones we think will succeed, and
these ones we think will fail.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:12.159
So it gives you a bit of a market analysis
but it is still very, very narrow around the

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:13.159
primary endpoint.

00:20:13.159 --> 00:20:15.259
CRAIG 24:11
Yeah, and in the primary endpoint, can you

00:20:15.259 --> 00:20:17.079
explain that a little bit?

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:19.259
What that means?

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:21.298
DAMON 24:19
Yeah, so for every trial, there's a goal that

00:20:21.298 --> 00:20:22.298
they're trying to reach.

00:20:22.298 --> 00:20:25.079
And they're called, you know, either primary
or secondary endpoints, or hypotheses.

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:29.288
Often there's more than one primary endpoint
and it might be, is this drug that we're testing,

00:20:29.288 --> 00:20:33.589
in layman's terms, does it outperform what's
currently the benchmark for this particular

00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:39.939
condition, or it might be an equivalence test;
It might be, does it perform at least as well.

00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:44.979
There's all sorts of, you know, different
primary endpoints and there might be secondary

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:46.349
endpoints as well.

00:20:46.349 --> 00:20:51.919
So, but our model— we set a very clear target
to predict.

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:56.959
And that's whether a trial will meet one or
more of its primary endpoints in the phase

00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:57.959
that it's in.

00:20:57.959 --> 00:21:02.209
But there are other targets that our model
could look at in the future.

00:21:02.209 --> 00:21:04.939
And we've done some experimentation around
this.

00:21:04.939 --> 00:21:08.779
And it could be, is the trial likely to complete
on time?

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:12.949
Is the trial likely to reach its target level
of patience?

00:21:12.949 --> 00:21:17.669
You know, these are important questions as
well that, you know, drug designers would

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:23.158
like to know from the outset, you know, like,
how realistic is it that we could get 700

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:26.969
patients for this condition, with this number
of sites, and this number of countries?

00:21:26.969 --> 00:21:28.499
Or how realistic is it that we can complete
it in 12 months?

00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:33.289
So there are other goals or targets that we
could predict but at the moment, we're focused

00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:39.059
on whether the trial would meet its primary
endpoint in the phase of that it's in.

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:43.079
CRAIG 25:51
So, reaching the primary endpoint doesn’t

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:46.229
necessarily correlate with a successful trial?

00:21:46.229 --> 00:21:47.329
Is that right?

00:21:47.329 --> 00:21:50.609
DAMON 26:03
Usually, if it meets its primary endpoint,

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.899
it can progress to the next phase but there's
commercial decisions to play as well, right?

00:21:52.899 --> 00:21:58.199
It might be, you know, whether it smashed
it out of the park, or whether it just matters

00:21:58.199 --> 00:22:02.428
endpoint, or whether competitors have come
in while this trial has been running.

00:22:02.428 --> 00:22:07.939
There's lots of other factors as well but
it doesn't necessarily mean that a drug is

00:22:07.939 --> 00:22:10.329
going to go all the way through FDA approval.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:15.899
It just means that it's eligible to get to
the next phase if it's met one of its primary

00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:16.899
endpoints.

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:19.289
CRAIG 26:38
Right, and does next phase mean phase one

00:22:19.289 --> 00:22:23.299
clinical trial, phase two clinical trial,
is at the phase you're talking about?

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:26.379
DAMON 26:48
Yeah, so phase one is usually around, you

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:28.369
know, is something safe to use.

00:22:28.369 --> 00:22:33.469
And then phase two, it's more around testing
safety, but then you start to test efficacy

00:22:33.469 --> 00:22:34.659
as well, whether it works.

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:38.069
And then phase three is testing whether it
works on a much larger sample of patients.

00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:43.009
So once you progress through all those phases
successfully, then that's when you can apply

00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:44.548
for, say FDA approval.

00:22:44.548 --> 00:22:47.428
I've simplified that a bit, but that's generally
the journey.

00:22:47.428 --> 00:22:50.119
CRAIG 27:20
Yeah, and right now you're offering it for

00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:51.699
meeting the phase one endpoint?

00:22:51.699 --> 00:22:54.439
Is that where the product stands right now?

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.859
DAMON 27:35
No, we cover all phases.

00:22:56.859 --> 00:23:00.469
So we could help design any trial that's in
phase one, two, or three.

00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:03.778
We cover all those phases, the predictions
are pretty accurate across those three phases.

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:07.319
Phase two tends to be the hardest to get a
successful trial, because that's where the

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:14.879
rubber hits the road and you're trying to
get efficacy for the first time, right.

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:23.689
So, if you're running a phase two trial, the
probability of success is usually a bit lower

00:23:23.689 --> 00:23:31.739
than if you're trying to test safety or in
a phase three trial, to prove efficacy on

00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:32.918
a larger sample.

00:23:32.918 --> 00:23:37.178
CRAIG 28:11
Yeah, in your test set, as you're developing

00:23:37.178 --> 00:23:44.569
this, this 90% accuracy, Saurabh, that you're
talking about, is that across all three phases

00:23:44.569 --> 00:23:46.278
of clinical trials?

00:23:46.278 --> 00:23:48.609
Have you tried predicting FDA approval?

00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:54.379
Or do you need more data, or you've tried
and your accuracy isn't where you want it

00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:56.859
to be yet before you start offering that?

00:23:56.859 --> 00:23:59.459
So the accuracy between phases is pretty consistent.

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:03.409
Also, interestingly, for rare or novel conditions,
the model predicts well in those areas as

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:04.409
well.

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.739
There was some concern that, if drugs never
been tested for a particular condition, how

00:24:06.739 --> 00:24:07.969
can a model predict success rates?

00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:13.178
But it turns out that there's enough data
on how trials are run in generally, what are

00:24:13.178 --> 00:24:17.759
good practices that are beneficial for rare
and novel conditions as well.

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:24.469
So, I actually do see that products like TrialKey
might actually lead to more rare conditions

00:24:24.469 --> 00:24:33.689
being investigated and researched because
you can have greater confidence of the outcomes,

00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:36.609
as a side note.

00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:45.319
In terms of FDA approval, that's probably
one of the next models that we're going to

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:46.319
tackle.

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:52.659
We're trying to get as much data as we can
around FDA approvals.

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:57.548
The data sources aren't as transparent as
a clinictrials.gov where everything's registered.

00:24:57.548 --> 00:25:09.209
So, we know what comes out the other end if
something's approved by the FDA but it's a

00:25:09.209 --> 00:25:11.479
little bit opaque about what actually got
submitted to the FDA.

00:25:11.479 --> 00:25:14.999
So, you can make some guesses about if something
passed the phase three, yes, it probably did

00:25:14.999 --> 00:25:17.089
go through that process, but may have failed.

00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:23.798
So, there's a few data challenges there but
something that we think we could get a model

00:25:23.798 --> 00:25:25.018
for instance, in time.

00:25:25.018 --> 00:25:28.259
CRAIG 30:31
How different does the model behave when looking

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:31.178
at US clinical trials, or European clinical
trials, or?

00:25:31.178 --> 00:25:33.459
I don't know which protocol Australia follows.

00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:35.129
Whether it's closer to Europe or the US.

00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:36.129
Is there a difference?

00:25:36.129 --> 00:25:41.089
Do you have to tweak the model for the regulatory
environment that it's being tested in?

00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:44.539
DAMON 31:00
Yeah, great question, so it turns out that

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:50.179
there's a number of countries around the world
that have their own database where clinical

00:25:50.179 --> 00:25:54.219
trials can get registered, but most significant
ones will be registered on the global one,

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.219
which is the American one.

00:25:55.219 --> 00:26:00.369
In terms of the way trials are run, there's
enough consistency in the parameters between

00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:03.189
different countries that we can match up the
dataset.

00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:07.699
So for example, in Australia, we have a database
called the A and Z CT but it's almost identical

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.109
to the one in the US.

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:12.719
So we can map that data so that we can combine
those datasets, and there's other ones around

00:26:12.719 --> 00:26:13.719
the world as well.

00:26:13.719 --> 00:26:14.949
And they’re run reasonably consistently.

00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:18.459
What is interesting, though, is that some
countries systematically over perform or underperform

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:21.369
for various conditions or phases, and that's
one of the insights from TrialKey.

00:26:21.369 --> 00:26:26.369
If you're running a particular trial, for
a drug, and a condition, there's countries

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:32.439
and sites that are going to be beneficial
to be in and ones that aren't going to be

00:26:32.439 --> 00:26:35.169
beneficial and it varies between phase and
conditions.

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:38.939
So that's incredible insights there where
you can significantly improve your success

00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:41.609
rate just by knowing what jurisdictions to
go to.

00:26:41.609 --> 00:26:47.489
And it might be something to do with patient
populations or it could be regulation.

00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:50.889
That's the part that the model doesn't tell
us.

00:26:50.889 --> 00:26:57.219
We need subject matter experts to help inform
us on that But it's a fascinating insight.

00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:01.579
I know, Saurabh, you've had some examples
of that as well.

00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:05.538
SAURABH 32:36
Yeah, so one of the companies we're doing

00:27:05.538 --> 00:27:09.839
a bit of work with and talking to, they’re
doing a clinical trial around vitamin D supplements.

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:19.359
So, one of the things the model actually pulled
out is if you're going to do that in Asia,

00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.359
you want to be in Indonesia.

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:24.859
And, probably, a reasonable question to ask—
because if you're in Australia, it's an Australian

00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:28.719
company, obviously people from Europe came
here 20 years ago.

00:27:28.719 --> 00:27:34.989
Europe didn't have a lot of sun, a lot of
sun in Australia.

00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:38.009
So people in Australia tend not to have vitamin
D deficiency.

00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:42.569
Plus we have a lifestyle, which is very outdoorsy,
very beachy, and all those kinds of things.

00:27:42.569 --> 00:27:46.979
If you're in Indonesia, it's a heavily Islamic
country so people cover up a lot.

00:27:46.979 --> 00:27:48.059
And people are outside less.

00:27:48.059 --> 00:27:51.249
So they actually get a lot less sun exposure
than they do here.

00:27:51.249 --> 00:27:54.589
I mean, equivalents in America would be, looking
at doing a vitamin D study, probably no point

00:27:54.589 --> 00:28:00.609
doing it in Florida or on a beach but you
want to do it in Alaska.

00:28:00.609 --> 00:28:08.559
All these things are hidden in the data, which
when you say it, oh my god, that's so obvious.

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:12.678
Similar for different genetic conditions,
there was a condition we were looking at,

00:28:12.678 --> 00:28:18.959
the model predicted you want people from Switzerland
because every region has slight genetic diversity

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:22.219
of our heritage and evolution over time, and
different conditions, you actually want different

00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:25.038
population sets to help you, kind of, really
declare efficacy or not.

00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:28.949
CRAIG 33:55
That's fascinating, So this is a SaaS product.

00:28:28.949 --> 00:28:29.949
Is that right?

00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:36.138
And the customers go on and subscribe, I presume,
and then they go on to the platform, and then

00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:37.298
they load their data up themselves.

00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:38.298
Is that right?

00:28:38.298 --> 00:28:41.298
Can you talk about how it works practically?

00:28:41.298 --> 00:28:45.749
SAURABH 34:24
Totally, the way it works, you go on, you

00:28:45.749 --> 00:28:50.599
sign up for a trial, then if you're happy
you continue on.

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:54.099
So the simple version is you have all those
trials to search for.

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:57.839
So you can type in a condition, cancers, most
are lung cancer, what are the trials currently

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:09.820
in phase three that are going to complete
and then in the next year, it gives you a

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:17.739
list of all those trials, and it gives you
a lot of data about them.

00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:20.028
And it tells you why the prediction is 17%
or 72%.

00:29:20.028 --> 00:29:24.028
And it gives you each of those 700 variables
that were meaningful, they kind of bubble

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:26.129
to the top.

00:29:26.129 --> 00:29:33.899
But then let's say that you have your own
trial, we have an interface right now— it's

00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:36.398
almost like a clinical trial simulator.

00:29:36.398 --> 00:29:41.609
We can literally upload your protocol, we'll
grab whatever variables we can, you might

00:29:41.609 --> 00:29:43.849
need to tweak some, adjust them.

00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:46.839
And then you can actually simulate that trial.

00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:52.949
What we're building now, and hopefully be
done the next couple of weeks, is almost like

00:29:52.949 --> 00:29:58.119
a bit of a slider bar, where we'll recommend
the optimal for every variable.

00:29:58.119 --> 00:30:01.969
But you might say, look, the model says we
need 700 patients, we can't afford it and

00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:04.649
we can only get 300 patients based on our
budget.

00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:09.969
So you can slide that down and we'll tell
you what the impact of that is on your probability

00:30:09.969 --> 00:30:10.969
of success.

00:30:10.969 --> 00:30:14.899
For the first couple, you probably need our
help, but over time, companies will just be

00:30:14.899 --> 00:30:16.939
able to do this themselves.

00:30:16.939 --> 00:30:20.609
CRAIG 35:34
Yeah, how many variables can you tweak?

00:30:20.609 --> 00:30:25.009
DAMON 35:44
So yeah, I think the base model that we're

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:30.528
going to launch in a couple of weeks, we'll
probably have around 30 or 40, that you can

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:31.528
tweak.

00:30:31.528 --> 00:30:37.528
From those variables, that's when we can create
the full 700 variables from those base 30

00:30:37.528 --> 00:30:41.309
or 40 variables using natural language processing,
using combinations of variables.

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:48.269
There'll be at least 30 to 40 and they vary
from the simple stuff like choice of patients

00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:53.649
to the actual protocol itself, inclusion/exclusion
criteria, or endpoints you're trying to meet;

00:30:53.649 --> 00:30:59.449
things like, who you want to work with, like,
principal investigators, what sites, what

00:30:59.449 --> 00:31:04.829
countries you want to be in, all that sort
of stuff is selectable.

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:08.548
That has an impact on the probability of success.

00:31:08.548 --> 00:31:14.949
So you can imagine, you know, if you're tweaking
30 variables, there's the scope to really,

00:31:14.949 --> 00:31:20.798
I don't want to use the word gamify but let’s
say, optimize your trial.

00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:27.658
And often it's low hanging fruit that can
be tackled, you could change from doing open

00:31:27.658 --> 00:31:34.258
label masking to double blind, which is a
technical thing but just by changing that,

00:31:34.258 --> 00:31:38.619
it could significantly increase the probability
for a certain phase or condition.

00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:40.749
And that's what our model will shed light
on.

00:31:40.749 --> 00:31:43.699
CRAIG 37:06
How big is the market for this, do you think?

00:31:43.699 --> 00:31:45.839
SAURABH 37:37
So, fingers crossed, it's quite big.

00:31:45.839 --> 00:31:50.589
Because what I'm hoping will happen with a
tool like this is— right now there’s about

00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:53.689
35,000 trials happen in the world every year
on humans.

00:31:53.689 --> 00:31:59.918
I think what a model like this will actually
do is make it so there'll be millions of trials

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:04.379
that will happen in the AI world and you'll
have less trials happening in people.

00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:07.059
So it might not be 35,000, it might be 5000.

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:11.548
But you'll find those trials will be, like,
overfunded and over-resourced so they can

00:32:11.548 --> 00:32:15.199
kind of get through the game very, very quickly.

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:24.069
And at some point in time, it's going to be
like, Well, why would you do a trial in people,

00:32:24.069 --> 00:32:27.638
if you haven't done it in AI first?

00:32:27.638 --> 00:32:31.199
It will almost become like an ethical thing.

00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:40.109
I'm sure kids are learning to drive in a decade,
like, you won't learn to drive in a car, you’ll

00:32:40.109 --> 00:32:44.048
learn to drive in a simulator.

00:32:44.048 --> 00:32:49.148
And once you're great at that, then they'll
let you out on the real world because it would

00:32:49.148 --> 00:32:55.709
be so unsafe to let someone learn to drive
on the real road.

00:32:55.709 --> 00:33:00.969
So I think this will just be a thing in five
or 10 years, every trial will happen in AI.

00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:05.699
And once they've optimized it and figured
out which ones to back and not back.

00:33:05.699 --> 00:33:08.069
That's what they'll do in the human population.

00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:10.979
CRAIG 38:40
Yeah, wow, that's fascinating.

00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:14.329
And you don't look at the molecules, do you?

00:33:14.329 --> 00:33:18.219
SAURABH 38:52
Not yet, but we're about to start some work

00:33:18.219 --> 00:33:19.219
there.

00:33:19.219 --> 00:33:24.339
I mean, Damon, you can probably talk about
some of the molecule work that we're doing

00:33:24.339 --> 00:33:25.339
right now.

00:33:25.339 --> 00:33:28.069
DAMON 38:57
Yeah, one of the benefits of using natural

00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:33.609
language processing models is that you can
extract the molecules, the compounds that

00:33:33.609 --> 00:33:35.249
we used for each trial.

00:33:35.249 --> 00:33:45.398
And then there's a separate database that
has the properties of those molecules and

00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:53.259
compounds, and we're in the process of ingesting
that information into the model.

00:33:53.259 --> 00:34:01.798
It's one of our next steps and that will be
very interesting to see, what sort of an impact

00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:04.189
those properties will have on success rates.

00:34:04.189 --> 00:34:09.699
So, my hypothesis is that they will have an
impact, but not as much as the trial design

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:10.699
itself.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:20.038
From what I've seen so far from TrailKey is
about 60% of the world's trials are designed

00:34:20.038 --> 00:34:21.038
poorly.

00:34:21.038 --> 00:34:22.038
There's major design flaws in them.

00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:26.758
So I think that there's a lot of drugs or
devices that would probably have been successful

00:34:26.758 --> 00:34:30.099
had the trial been structured correctly.

00:34:30.099 --> 00:34:35.349
It's not the underlying molecule or compound
that was the problem, it was the actual design

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:39.019
of the trial that led it to failure.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:41.909
So I think hidden in the data, there would
be 1000s of these drugs, or devices that would

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.809
have shown efficacy and they’re just sitting
there orphaned at the moment.

00:34:43.809 --> 00:34:48.499
So maybe something like TrialKey might bring
back some of those prospects and candidates

00:34:48.499 --> 00:34:50.499
and better testing can be done.

00:34:50.499 --> 00:34:52.509
CRAIG 40:24
Yeah, wow, that's exciting.

00:34:52.509 --> 00:34:55.198
So the product is launching when?

00:34:55.198 --> 00:34:57.239
SAURABH 40:34
So it launched about a month ago.

00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:01.948
So you can go on to trialkey.ai, you can sign
up now you can get a bit of a trial.

00:35:01.948 --> 00:35:03.958
One other point I'll make just further to
Damon's point.

00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:09.009
So where Damon and the guys really thought,
Oh, there's something to this, was during

00:35:09.009 --> 00:35:10.009
Covid.

00:35:10.009 --> 00:35:11.689
So, that's when they first built the model.

00:35:11.689 --> 00:35:16.139
There are about 800 vaccine candidates out
in the world and what the model predicted

00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:19.699
was Pfizer and— sorry Pfizer and AstraZeneca
or Pfizer and Moderna Damon?

00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:22.969
DAMON 41:01
Pfizer and Moderna were, I think one and three

00:35:22.969 --> 00:35:23.969
in our predictions.

00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:26.349
SAURABH 41:09
And that's the way the world ended up and

00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:27.629
that's the way, you know, reality happened.

00:35:27.629 --> 00:35:33.799
But if he knew that before the event, it's
almost like buying a lottery ticket after

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:38.579
it's drawn, then you would have just over
indexed your effort and resources on those

00:35:38.579 --> 00:35:39.579
ones.

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:44.208
And the other 750, you might have done the
top 50 with the other 750, you just wouldn't

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:49.589
have done, you would have really, kind of,
pivoted your resources towards those guys.

00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:53.399
But that was an example of something really
novel, right?

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:59.889
That was all around mRNA vaccines, which hadn't
really been done before, but the model still

00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:05.499
got right, because a big part of their success
was how they designed their trials.

00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:09.829
And some of these large farmers just have
more money, have more resources, have more

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:11.279
expertise to design them better.

00:36:11.279 --> 00:36:14.769
And that's what I think will get democratize
across, you know, all pharmaceutical companies,

00:36:14.769 --> 00:36:17.299
they'll all have access to the same level
of of insight,

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:18.909
DAMON 41:58
And particularly hospitals and universities,

00:36:18.909 --> 00:36:21.689
which are systematic underperformers when
it comes to clinical trials success, the models

00:36:21.689 --> 00:36:23.519
showed that to be a fact of the data.

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:28.799
So, I think products like TrialKey could lift
the standard of research in hospitals and

00:36:28.799 --> 00:36:34.188
universities, and create a level playing field,
I suppose, so that they could compete with

00:36:34.188 --> 00:36:35.839
the bigger end of town.

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:39.509
CRAIG 42:27
And I would guess it would also increase investment

00:36:39.509 --> 00:36:43.819
for underfunded companies that have good ideas,
if they can show that the likelihood of a

00:36:43.819 --> 00:36:47.669
trial succeeding people would be more willing
to invest.

00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:52.479
At some point, do you think this would be
standardized so that there is a TrialKey seal

00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:54.879
of approval or TrialKey badge or something?

00:36:54.879 --> 00:37:00.269
Because predicting for the company is one
thing but the company being able to use that

00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:04.458
to raise capital or whatever use they might
have beyond actually going ahead with a trial

00:37:04.458 --> 00:37:05.458
that would be important.

00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:07.909
SAURABH 43:17
Totally, I mean, I think what it will be—

00:37:07.909 --> 00:37:12.529
because the real subtlety to what you said
was, I think a tool like ours would lead to

00:37:12.529 --> 00:37:17.069
an efficient allocation of capital, where
money and resources will go to the trials,

00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:19.359
and the drugs, and the molecules that are
most likely going to succeed.

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:26.329
And once that kind of gets accepted and people
see this working over time, I think you're

00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:27.329
right.

00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:31.929
It will flip the other way, so anyone who's
looking to seek funding will probably have

00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:32.929
like a TrailKey rating.

00:37:32.929 --> 00:37:39.738
A bit like you get energy ratings for appliances,
that same kind of thing.

00:37:39.738 --> 00:37:44.579
There'll be probably a similar rating for
all trials.

00:37:44.579 --> 00:37:50.149
And then before they go to seek funding, they'll
probably use a tool like ours to really optimize

00:37:50.149 --> 00:37:53.198
it to maximize the chance of success.

00:37:53.198 --> 00:37:57.409
And chance to success, it's a funny thing,
like in that rare kidney disease 54% was amazing

00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:04.299
but in something like obesity, you really
want to be above 70% to be differentiating.

00:38:04.299 --> 00:38:10.189
And then you can kind of use that, optimize
and it will just be a standard part of the

00:38:10.189 --> 00:38:14.649
funding process or for one of the large pharma
it’ll probably just be a standard part of

00:38:14.649 --> 00:38:19.988
their internal due diligence as they choose
which trials to cull and which ones to fund.

00:38:19.988 --> 00:38:22.468
DAMON 44:23
I'm wondering Craig, whether you should join

00:38:22.468 --> 00:38:23.929
our marketing team.

00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:27.339
I like the TrialKey seal of approval.

00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:29.769
I’m really warming to that.

00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:33.198
SAURABH 44:31
I can pitch you the stack!

00:38:33.198 --> 00:38:35.089
CRAIG 44:33
Yeah, that's right.

00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:36.478
Yeah, well, that's amazing.

00:38:36.478 --> 00:38:38.269
Whose idea was this?

00:38:38.269 --> 00:38:41.809
DAMON 44:48
Well, the idea came about three years ago,

00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:47.309
it was the then CEO of Opyl Michelle Gallagher
and I had a discussion around this market

00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:48.309
problem.

00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:51.738
It was one that I couldn't believe hadn't
been solved already, given it's $15 million

00:38:51.738 --> 00:38:56.609
on average to invest in a phase two trial
for a pharmaceutical company.

00:38:56.609 --> 00:39:01.218
I'm running sports betting models in the background
and pharmaceutical companies, and hospitals,

00:39:01.218 --> 00:39:04.488
universities aren't using big data for clinical
trials.

00:39:04.488 --> 00:39:09.629
It just seemed like a complete, I guess, oversight
that they weren't using machine learning and

00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:11.569
big data to help them design trials.

00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:14.889
So with that in mind, we set out to solve
this problem.

00:39:14.889 --> 00:39:18.679
We were one of the first, there's been, you
know, one or two competitors and some academic

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:21.369
papers written but as I said before, this
is still pretty much virgin territory.

00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:26.409
So yeah, coming from a sports betting background,
I just could not believe that this hadn't

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:28.639
been solved or attempted to be solved using
machine learning.

00:39:28.639 --> 00:39:30.938
CRAIG 45:55
Yeah, and I'm interested in the investment

00:39:30.938 --> 00:39:32.789
side, are you thinking about selling this
data to investors?

00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:35.599
SAURABH 46:13
Yeah, totally, I mean, we haven't quite figured

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:40.139
out the right model, whether it's like a subscription
fee charged to investors, or whether we actually

00:39:40.139 --> 00:39:43.789
just set up our own separate fund and use
that to invest in.

00:39:43.789 --> 00:39:54.209
So that's why for now, I think it's just more
Damon and I doing trades on the side.

00:39:54.209 --> 00:39:59.429
But once we kind of crack the pharmaceutical
game, I think this will be the next use case.

00:39:59.429 --> 00:40:05.978
We might then end up bifurcating the organizations,
one's a lot more pharma focus, one's a lot

00:40:05.978 --> 00:40:07.369
more investor focused.

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:11.399
CRAIG 46:41
Yeah, and as, Damon, as you were saying, you

00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:13.529
were surprised no one's done this.

00:40:13.529 --> 00:40:23.829
This kind of model could be applied to all
kinds of things.

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:33.909
Have you guys done any, or is it too early,
or do you think you will?

00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:37.819
DAMON 47:03
No, I've looked at other areas, other applications

00:40:37.819 --> 00:40:39.509
for this type of modeling.

00:40:39.509 --> 00:40:45.349
One, I've just launched actually it’s called
GolfSwings.ai, which will, I don't know if

00:40:45.349 --> 00:41:12.329
you're a golfer Craig or know any golfers,
but it can take your golf swing, just filmed

00:41:12.329 --> 00:41:28.339
from a regular smart device, it can determine
all your movement points, and then use explainable

00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:39.109
AI to predict what movements you can work
on to fast track your improvement, which ones

00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:42.849
are most likely to result in a handicap reduction.

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:48.849
So we've only just launched that product GolfSwings.ai.

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:54.339
And there's other applications as well, for
digital marketing, all sorts of possibilities

00:41:54.339 --> 00:41:55.799
in this space.

00:41:55.799 --> 00:42:07.978
But the one— this TrialKey one that we're
talking about today, given the size of the

00:42:07.978 --> 00:42:37.708
industry and what's at stake, this is an absolute
prime candidate for this technology.

00:42:37.708 --> 00:42:58.429
And we're excited about 
it but yeah, you're right.

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:04.609
There are definitely lots of use cases.

00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:13.329
CRAIG 48:03
Yeah, and Saurabh, did you say 30,000 odd

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:56.199
clinical trials a year and 
that could be reduced to 5000 if people knew

00:43:56.199 --> 00:44:09.559
the likelihood of success in a trial?

00:44:09.559 --> 00:48:59.829
And then you'd run them 

00:48:59.829 --> 00:49:06.229
in simulation before going into human trials—
that's a pretty powerful idea.

00:49:06.229 --> 00:49:09.589
SAURABH 48:41
And just to Damon's point, I mean, basically,

00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:14.069
what the guys have done is they've built a
generic way to solve what's actually a super

00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:15.409
generic problem.

00:49:15.409 --> 00:49:20.429
You got 1000 variables, an outcome, what variables
lead to that outcome, and how do you weigh

00:49:20.429 --> 00:49:22.899
those possibilities.

00:49:22.899 --> 00:49:26.511
And it just happens to be applied to the clinical
trials phase and that will be what we'll do

00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:30.649
for the next couple of years till we really
run this problem down; but it's a generic

00:49:30.649 --> 00:51:50.389
solution to an actual super generic problem.
