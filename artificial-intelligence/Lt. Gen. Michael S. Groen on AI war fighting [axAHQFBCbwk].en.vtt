00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Craig: Hi, my name is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.880
Craig Smith and this is Eye on AI&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.040
This week I speak with Lieutenant General&nbsp;
Michael S. Groen who took over as director&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.440
of the Department of Defense Joint Artificial&nbsp;
Intelligence Center in October last year.&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.880
General Groen likes to say that he is overseeing&nbsp;
JAIC 2.0 after the center was established by his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.880
predecessor, Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan.
Under General Groen, the JAIC will focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.600
less on building products
and focus more on building the framework&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.000
in which the 20 plus agencies in the Department&nbsp;
of Defense can build and implement AI. I hope you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.600
find the conversation as interesting as I did.
Welcome General Groen. What I'd like to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.840
start by having you introduce yourself,&nbsp;
give a little bit of background,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.040
where you grew up, how you got into the&nbsp;
military and how you ended up as director&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.
Gen. Groen: Great. Well, thanks Craig. Really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.280
really appreciate you having me on the show.&nbsp;
I'm a big fan I've followed your coverage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.520
especially of the NSCAI commissioners. That's&nbsp;
been really helpful. As you probably know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.560
or you can figure out from their words, the JAIC&nbsp;
has its roots in that conversation with the NSCAI.&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.960
And so, we're grateful to that conversation&nbsp;
and to those members and everybody else who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.440
working on the AI problem here in Defense.&nbsp;
So, I'm very fortunate to be a member of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.040
JAIC, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.&nbsp;
The JAIC is a small but mighty organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.760
We have of an entire department to transform.
And so, we've got a lot of work ahead of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.280
The JAIC is full of military and civilian&nbsp;
members all committed to the transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
of military capabilities for an information&nbsp;
age. And it's so easy to see that in the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.320
around us, yet defense lags in the&nbsp;
application of those technologies.&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.520
Myself, I grew up in Michigan as a Midwestern boy.&nbsp;
I'm just a hard working Marine, but I really care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.040
very deeply about this because I do see this as&nbsp;
a strategic effort. Thinking about technology and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.040
its impact on war fighting, you look at things&nbsp;
like revolutions in military affairs past, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.600
see examples of militaries and organizations kind&nbsp;
of walking into an environment that's completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.680
changed, but yet they're unaware of that change,&nbsp;
even if they've seen the artifacts of that.&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.960
And that's, and that's kind of really what&nbsp;
primarily drives our concern. So, I grew up in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.080
Intel community, but I've been an operational&nbsp;
commander. I've been in the Joint Staff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.240
I've been an acquisition and requirements officer.
I have a good STEM background. So, I'm far from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.720
an expert in anything here, but I do think I&nbsp;
understand war fighting and I really have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.280
goal and a vision for how we integrate AI to make&nbsp;
our war fighting much more effective. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.040
if you don't mind, let me just tell&nbsp;
you a little bit about the JAIC.&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.600
I know, not, not all of your listeners probably&nbsp;
even really know what the JAIC is, perhaps. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920
the JAIC Is the Joint Artificial Intelligence&nbsp;
Center, and our mission is to transform the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.640
Department through the integration of artificial&nbsp;
intelligence. The JAIC is an implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.320
organization, so our priority is making consumers&nbsp;
across the Department successful in transforming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.840
their enterprises with artificial intelligence.
And to meet that mission, we look to accelerate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.360
the adoption of AI. And so, we're looking across&nbsp;
the scope and scale of the Department of Defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.760
And you can readily see the challenge of that&nbsp;
scope and scale. I mean, the Department of Defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.200
is on the order of 3 million people on&nbsp;
the order of $700 billion enterprise.&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.960
So, you see the challenge, but you can&nbsp;
also just as readily see the necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.040
If there's any place that we should have efficient&nbsp;
and effective enterprises driven by modern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.800
information technology to include artificial&nbsp;
intelligence, the Department of Defense is it.&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.280
And so, we're really excited about the challenge.&nbsp;
What's really compelling to largely young members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.640
in the Department - the Department of Defense&nbsp;
is a fairly youthful organization, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.200
look at it in aggregate - they grew up in a&nbsp;
world surrounded by artificial intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.400
Hundreds of times of day, we all touch artificial&nbsp;
intelligence, but it's penetrated the Department&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.280
of Defense to a much, much lesser degree.
And our mission here in the JAIC is to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.560
that. We see how information&nbsp;
makes things move faster,&nbsp;

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.680
makes processes more efficient. And so, we live that&nbsp;
every day, but the impacts on warfare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.040
are still unclear. They're imminently foreseeable,&nbsp;
right? Because we live in this universe. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.200
risk is that they will not be foreseen.
And so, part of our job in implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.840
is to get people to understand, to foresee&nbsp;
what's foreseeable and to make the changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.320
that we can now. It'd be unconscionable&nbsp;
for the Department to not be prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.960
for the changes that we can readily foresee.
And so, that's why the Department&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.280
in partnership with Congress, created the JAIC.&nbsp;
It's an implementation organization. We are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.760
a research-y organization. We have deep ties&nbsp;
to the research and development and engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.160
elements of the Department of Defense. We&nbsp;
have a great relationship with DARPA, with R&amp;E,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.200
but our role is focused on implementation.
We want to take technology and turn it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.240
capability. Our first priority is to broadly&nbsp;
enable AI consumers across the Department&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.240
so that we can achieve scale. Our&nbsp;
second priority is to develop and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.000
deliver AI capabilities and enabling services.
So, we build AIs here in the JAIC and we field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.120
them, only second in priority to enabling others,&nbsp;
to integrate AI into their own enterprises.&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.000
Thirdly, we coordinate and synchronize the&nbsp;
integration of all of the capabilities that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.120
largely being developed by the services in the&nbsp;
Department into a cohesive enterprise, to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.800
it effective, make it efficient and allow smooth&nbsp;
seamless operations across domains and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.560
And then finally, we mature the supporting&nbsp;
structures of an AI friendly ecosystem, right? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.960
we want to create the conditions for life. I love&nbsp;
to think of that analogy. We set the conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.440
for life and we have a Cambrian explosion of&nbsp;
artificial intelligence across the Department.&nbsp;

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.040
That's what we're after. And so, our energy that&nbsp;
goes into implementation, it's all about achieving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.840
that objective.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.160
Craig:&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you talk about the joint war fighting&nbsp;
national mission initiative? What's the scope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.600
and how it's organized. I've read about the five&nbsp;
lines of effort. And I won't repeat them here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.560
but it's not clear to me at this point,&nbsp;
whether they involve particular weapon systems.&nbsp;

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.000
And if they do, I'd love to hear&nbsp;
what some of the most ambitious are.&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.600
Gen. Groen: Yeah, sure. Of course. So, the joint&nbsp;
war fighting national mission initiative or we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.760
just call it joint warfighting here in the&nbsp;
JAIC, it represents those AI developments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.920
that we're building inside the JAIC.&nbsp;
Remember, most of the AI initiatives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.640
across the Department are done in the services.
So, the services are developing capabilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.160
responsive to their own war fighting requirements,&nbsp;
but we are partners in all of those. We're partners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
with all the services, but we also then&nbsp;
build some of these things ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.520
Again, in partnership with one or more of the&nbsp;
other agencies or services in the Department.&nbsp;

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.880
So, joint war fighting; what that means to us&nbsp;
is we've aligned our AI development roughly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.880
with the war fighting functions and for, for&nbsp;
those who might not be familiar with that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.400
the Department identifies joint&nbsp;
war fighting functions and it bins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:33.200
things into: Command and Control is one; Maneuver;&nbsp;
Fires; Intelligence; Logistics; and Force Protection;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.240
and Cyber and Information. We've aligned our&nbsp;
development efforts then with those war fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.560
functions. The reason we do that is because then&nbsp;
we can work with the communities who are already.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.440
In that space, for example the Army and their&nbsp;
Project Convergence, which you've probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.800
heard about. They're very much into optimizing&nbsp;
Command and Control and Fires application.&nbsp;

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.360
And so, we can work with them then because&nbsp;
we're organized in a way that matches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.800
their approach. So, in Joint All Domain&nbsp;
Command Control, for example, the AIs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.943
were working there include things that drive, like,&nbsp;decision-making; decision-making for commanders 

00:08:07.943 --> 00:08:11.308
on the battlefield, decision-making for theater commanders

00:08:11.308 --> 00:08:17.188
who&nbsp;have large scale strategic problems that they're faced with.So, to help battlefield&nbsp;understanding, 

00:08:17.188 --> 00:08:18.622
to help situational awareness,

00:08:18.622 --> 00:08:22.705
those are things that we do under what we&nbsp;
call All Domain Command and Control.

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:28.132
And there's an obvious linkage there to the future of that Joint All Domain Command and Control project. 

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:34.845
Our next line of effort, we call it Overmatch; maneuver and tempo, right? So, it's all about now, on the battlefield, 

00:08:34.845 --> 00:08:39.990
understanding the threat. What is the threat doing? What threats are posed? What risks are on the battlefield,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.401
right now?&nbsp;And then, understanding Blue. As important as understanding the enemy when you're making

00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:47.848
decisions in a war fighting environment is understanding yourself, right? 

00:08:47.848 --> 00:08:50.430
So, you&nbsp;
have to know what's the status of your forces.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.370
Where are their logistics challenges, for example.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.738
If Alpha Company's out of fuel, well then that's going to impact the way you plan your operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:02.914
So, using AI to help commanders make data-driven decisions, not through a bank of phones,&nbsp;

00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:06.000
calling down to every unit, but data that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.600
generated in the force and presented to&nbsp;
the commander, so this commander, he,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.080
or she, can make good smart decisions about&nbsp;
how to win. That's what we call Overmatch.&nbsp;

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.920
We're, we've also got a line of effort&nbsp;
along the lines of Joint Fires, right? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.080
this takes the form of integrating intelligence&nbsp;
and fire. So how do you use the intelligence that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.200
that's produced on the battlefield and turn&nbsp;
that into responsive decisions quickly? And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.880
all of these are designed to tee up decisions&nbsp;
for commanders in much faster ways and in much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.280
higher quality than they might be able to do&nbsp;
without the use of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.760
We have another line of effort that deals&nbsp;
with the electromagnetic spectrum, cyber and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.760
information warfare. Our work in those areas help&nbsp;
us understand the cyber domain, help commanders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.240
understand what is happening in the information&nbsp;
space, leveraging things like natural language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.680
processing, for example, to understand media in a&nbsp;
foreign language. That sort of thing, it's a fairly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.160
standard capability in the AI community, but what&nbsp;
we're doing is applying those capabilities for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.960
military problems. So that commanders, again, can&nbsp;
make better decisions. And then the final one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.680
strategic logistics. Personally, I'm really&nbsp;
excited about logistics. Amateurs study tactics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.840
and professionals study logistics. And when&nbsp;
you look at the vast logistics enterprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.520
and the capital that's invested in that&nbsp;
enterprise and how critical that is to operations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.960
helping logisticians and mobility leaders make&nbsp;
decisions about how fast to move things, how much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.440
fuel do we actually need? How do we have to get&nbsp;
it there? How about ammunition? How about people?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.800
How about medical? All of those things should be&nbsp;
data-driven and all of those things should be at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.200
the fingertips of a commander so that a commander&nbsp;
and his staff can make better decisions about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.840
strategic mobility and strategic logistics.
And so, those are the kinds of things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.280
were working. And again, none&nbsp;
of those, we work in isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.440
All of those, we're trying to work with partners&nbsp;
in the Department who have a vested interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.240
in making sure that those kinds of things are&nbsp;
successful. One of the other things that really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.800
helps us, because we have, we have our fingers&nbsp;
in all of the different war fighting functions,&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.040
that really puts us in a good position&nbsp;
to integrate these things into fabrics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.600
of capabilities. Right? What we want is,&nbsp;
as capabilities are developed across these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.960
war-fighting functions, that development converges&nbsp;
on an integrated capability. That's not a natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.600
act inside the Department of Defense, right?
So, if we can get the developments to converge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.920
right, to actually steer these things&nbsp;
to an integrated combat capability,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.920
that’s at the heart of joint war fighting.&nbsp;
That's what we're really excited about. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.160
we want a force that understands its environment,&nbsp;
a force that has a court sense, right?&nbsp;

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.160
For the battlefield environment across multiple&nbsp;
domains. That's not easy to build. A force that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.160
has an ethical basis for its actions and&nbsp;
a force that can move very, very fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.200
right? Make good decisions and move fast to pose&nbsp;
challenges for an opponent. And that's what our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.040
whole joint war fighting effort is all about.
Craig: all of them that you've mentioned relate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.920
to data analysis and information flows. People,&nbsp;
myself included are always eager to hear about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.640
specific weapons systems, particularly&nbsp;
when it comes to artificial intelligence.&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.360
Are there any weapons systems within that&nbsp;
that are public and that you can talk about?&nbsp;

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.680
Gen. Groen: We think that systems that help&nbsp;
enable commanders to, to, to do effective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.400
command and control is a weapon system, right?&nbsp;
Because it is critical to combat capability.&nbsp;

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.520
So, through that lens, I would say, yes,&nbsp;
absolutely. We're designing those weapons systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.360
But again, all of those weapons systems are&nbsp;
to facilitate and make more efficient and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.880
effective war-fighting functions that we already&nbsp;
execute. We have not taken major steps into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.280
what you would call autonomy, right?
Department of Defense has a very well-defined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.960
autonomy policy and regulations. If any of&nbsp;
your readers want to take a look at this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.640
look at the, the DOD 3000.09, which is the&nbsp;
autonomy policy for the Department. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.240
it's very clear and it's very effective.
And it's unprecedented, right? The United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.600
States has put its marker down for the level&nbsp;
of human control that it will use in weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.080
systems and weapons systems development. That's an&nbsp;
accomplishment we should be proud of as a nation.&nbsp;

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.320
But within that most of the programs&nbsp;
we're developing here are focused on data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.760
ISR data management, integrating data flows from&nbsp;
places in the intelligence community, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.280
so that we can use that data more effectively&nbsp;
for decision-making, being predictive and having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.280
the ability to forecast based on modeling&nbsp;
and simulation of data flows that we have.&nbsp;

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.120
So generally, I think the common theme that you&nbsp;
would hear in the things that we're developing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.320
it's all about helping humans&nbsp;
make better decisions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.800
helping to generate man machine teams.
In a modern war fighting environment in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.360
any war fighting environment, why would we&nbsp;
ever send flesh against steel, as it were?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.640
Why would you put a human in harm's way If you&nbsp;
could put a machine in that place first? That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.680
the kind of stuff that we're talking about today.
Craig: Yeah, I wasn't referring necessarily to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.480
autonomy. I'm particularly interested in&nbsp;
swarm technology and I've been reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.280
what's coming out of China. China's done&nbsp;
a lot of research on swarm technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.920
even publicly. There was a paper within the last&nbsp;
month or so out of a Chinese university about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:16.480
drones swarms navigating through a forest,&nbsp;
which I found fascinating. When I said specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.520
weapons systems, I was really referring to putting&nbsp;
AI into weapons for things like navigating through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.040
interior environments and that sort of thing.
How much of what the DOD does is driven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.680
by what China's doing.
Gen. Groen: Yeah. So, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.320
that's a great question. Obviously, we keep a&nbsp;
very close eye on what the People's Liberation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.120
Army is doing with AI integration. I would say,&nbsp;
most of what we're doing is in response to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.000
transformation of warfare in an information&nbsp;
age. We see this technology around us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.120
in the commercial environment every day. We know&nbsp;
what's possible. And if you look at a Department&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.280
of Defense process or a war fighting process,&nbsp;
you should step back and ask yourself, well, how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.680
would this internet company handle this problem,
or how would that internet company handle this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.320
problem? Right? If you're creating a marketplace&nbsp;
for material, for example, well, the internet is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.600
loaded with storefronts and delivery mechanisms&nbsp;
and payment mechanisms. And all of those things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.960
have an analog in the defense enterprise.
And so, we don't have to go far to, to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.440
fired in your imagination of how you could apply&nbsp;
AI. And so most of what we do, and I think across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.200
the Department, not just the JAIC, it's in response&nbsp;
to this transformation. We can see the war fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.280
imperative for modernization and we're doing it in&nbsp;
a purposely transparent, ethical, and responsible way.&nbsp;

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.760
When we try to make defense as effective and&nbsp;
efficient as, as the commercial enterprises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.400
around us, then I think we're moving in the right&nbsp;
direction. The other thing we are driven by our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.800
international partnerships. So here at the&nbsp;
JAIC, it's very clear in our conversations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.640
with our international partners, and there are&nbsp;
several, you could probably guess most of them,&nbsp;

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.680
you know, we share an ethical foundation for AI&nbsp;
and we share the same kind of concerns about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.400
human control and autonomy, and the ethical basis&nbsp;
upon which you build your AI capabilities. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.480
we actually have a partnership with&nbsp;
12 other nations. There's 13 of us now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.320
We call it the AI Partnership for Defense, and&nbsp;
we use this group of like-minded democracies,&nbsp;

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.720
that are as conscious as we are of the ethical&nbsp;
challenges in this environment, to a shared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.320
commitment, right? To be accountable, accountable&nbsp;
to each other and accountable to our citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.720
And, in the context of China that you mentioned,&nbsp;
the U S has published clear ethical and policy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.640
positions on AI, autonomy, accountability, and
we're investing in this ethical foundation.&nbsp;

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.600
The Chinese Communist Party and the PLA stand&nbsp;
in marked contrast to that. The Chinese have vocally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.920
and aggressively articulated their goal to&nbsp;
use AI to make the world's most powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.160
military. They've got highly publicized&nbsp;
goals of dominance in the AI space.&nbsp;

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.800
Well, clearly, we watch closely the efforts of&nbsp;
the PLA to modernize their force and they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.920
their doctrine of informationalized warfare and&nbsp;
intelligentized warfare. And so, it's very clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.840
They're focused on integrating AI into their&nbsp;
weapons systems in their approach. And again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.920
I think that unified approach of the military&nbsp;
civil fusion enabled by the Chinese Communist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.240
Party and the PLA uses state-owned enterprises to drive&nbsp;
military AI capabilities into the PLA, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.640
without the same sort of accountability&nbsp;
checks that we have in our system. There is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.080
accountability to the people in that system.
Whereas in our system, we have very close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.960
oversight in everything that we do. So is&nbsp;
what we're doing driven by China? Certainly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.040
we pay close attention. Certainly, we see the&nbsp;
artifacts that China invests in. Things like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:38.240
national intelligence law that compels Chinese&nbsp;
citizens abroad for work or study or whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.600
to report their study and findings to the CCP.
We know that puts US tech industry, the tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.600
firms and universities in a very difficult&nbsp;
position because they know that Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.080
citizens will be compelled to tell everything&nbsp;
that they've learned when they get back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.560
That kind of stuff, that kind of environment,&nbsp;
just gives us cause for concern about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.800
ethical baseline for AI development in the PRC.
And so, does that drive our specific development?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.840
We certainly keep a close eye on it. We certainly&nbsp;
want to understand what they're doing and we also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.720
want to make clear so that our partners and our&nbsp;
allies, those who share the ethical foundations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.640
we do, are also paying attention to that.&nbsp;
We can't pretend that's not the case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.160
so it gives us cause for concern and it doesn't&nbsp;
drive us per se, but it would be imprudent for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.840
not to keep our eyes on that contact.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.960
Craig: I have a couple of questions on your&nbsp;
ascension to the director's role,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.120
which coincides with the JAIC being moved out&nbsp;
from under the DOD's Chief Information Officer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.760
to report directly to the Deputy&nbsp;
Secretary of Defense. How is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.840
likely to impact the JAIC's effectiveness?
Gen. Groen: Yeah, that's a great question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.000
Craig, because first of all, I think it's&nbsp;
an important expression of the priority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.560
that Congress places on AI integration.
To me that's a really powerful message here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.800
Congress cares enough that they want to ensure&nbsp;
that the Department is focused on this transition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.960
of AI and AI integration. So, first, first of all,&nbsp;
I would also say we have great partnerships with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.800
the Chief Information Officer and the deputy CIOs.&nbsp;
So, software engineer is important to us. Cloud is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.600
important to us. Security is important to us. And&nbsp;
so were joined at the hip with those elements of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.560
digital modernization across the Department, but&nbsp;
frankly, artificial intelligence is different.&nbsp;

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.080
Right? because it actually has a&nbsp;
significant impact on our mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.800
AI is not IT. The implementation of AI is&nbsp;
foundationally about the decision processes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.720
that occur in the department, whether&nbsp;
those are war fighting decisions or support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:50.480
enterprise decisions or business decisions.
So, we like to say here that we want AI to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.520
be our military future. I mean that if we want AI&nbsp;
to be our military future, then we have to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:01.040
making it our military present. Right. And that&nbsp;
means that the JAIC has to be a partner across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.240
the Department to make it so, and being linked&nbsp;
to the Dep[uty] Sec[retary of] Def[ense] in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.440
regard really helps us make those partnerships.
So, to get back to AI is not IT, our biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.520
challenge is not technology. I mean, the&nbsp;
technology is mature. The technology exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.480
Of course, it continues to develop. Of course,&nbsp;
risks come and counter risks come and, we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.400
continue to follow the flow of AI technology.
But honestly, for a lot of our core missions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.880
things like business process transformation inside&nbsp;
the Department of Defense, the tech is there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.640
It's just a matter of imagination&nbsp;
and implementation. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.040
to get that imagination and implementation applied&nbsp;
in the places where AI can help the Department,&nbsp;

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.880
we don't need IT people to think about it. We&nbsp;
need decision-makers. We need functional experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.120
We need technical experts in comptroller&nbsp;
activities or logistics activities. Or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.920
as we move into the war fighting domain, into&nbsp;
fires activities, or intelligence activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:02.240
We need those functional experts to weigh in&nbsp;
on how to use AI to change their processes.&nbsp;

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:09.200
If AI is perceived as IT, it's some black box&nbsp;
that I put on my desk and maybe I'll log into it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.880
then we have failed. We have to think about this&nbsp;
as a war fighting capability, as a Department&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.080
capability for effective and efficient operations.&nbsp;
And that means people, decision makers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.640
leaders have to be right in the fight here.
Craig: And another part of that question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.680
do the various AI initiatives in&nbsp;
the services now report to the JAIC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.520
or is the JAIC playing a coordinating role just&nbsp;
to ensure there aren't duplications of effort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.200
and to track who's doing what?
Gen. Groen: Okay. Yeah. Great, great question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.080
So yes, there are a thousand flowers blooming&nbsp;
across the Department for artificial intelligence.&nbsp;

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.960
I think every senior leader in the Department&nbsp;
of Defense understands, kind of in their bones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.280
that there's a transformation afoot here&nbsp;
and that we need to get out in front of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.560
And so, every service has a robust effort&nbsp;
at building artificial intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.440
Many of the 20-plus defense agencies that&nbsp;
are part of the Department of Defense are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.960
interested in AI and some of them,&nbsp;
some of the defense agencies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.160
great artificial intelligence networks already.&nbsp;
So, the JAIC doesn't direct those individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.280
efforts, but we are the catalyst to&nbsp;
achieving this broad transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.760
So, as a, as I kind of indicated before the&nbsp;
JAIC's a tool to enable broad implementation.&nbsp;

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:27.200
So those places that maybe are not moving as fast&nbsp;
as they would like in artificial intelligence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.600
we're designed to help them. We want to&nbsp;
create that tide that lifts all boats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.640
across the Department. So, our work includes&nbsp;
implementation then extends to bringing stovepiped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.880
capabilities into cohesive enterprise.
And that sounds obvious, but I think,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.600
anybody who's spent time in the Department of&nbsp;
Defense knows that, we just naturally create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.920
these horrendous stovepipes. And so, every&nbsp;
service will develop their own capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.080
And then we'll try to lash them together&nbsp;
at the last minute or lash our war-fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.120
constructs together using those capabilities.
And so, the JAIC serves as a catalyst by doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.000
things like establishing governance, establishing&nbsp;
sound ethical foundations that everybody follows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.080
to build test and evaluation standards. And that's&nbsp;
our role here as the center to actually now start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.080
turning technology initiatives in artificial&nbsp;
intelligence into real integrated capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.640
among the services, among the domains,&nbsp;
airspace, sea land, and then to help move the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.240
ball forward on enterprising those capabilities.
Craig: The pandemic relief bill requires you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:36.400
create an inventory of all ongoing AI activities&nbsp;
across the Department and services. Tracking AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.720
projects has been a challenge because there isn't&nbsp;
an easy way to identify them short of a qualitative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.560
survey. Can you talk about that inventory?
Does an inventory exist already within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.520
JAIC? Whether you already have an idea of&nbsp;
how much money has been allocated for those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.880
projects that are underway?
Gen. Groen: Great question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.200
And we're actually really happy with this&nbsp;
task because we want to create an environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.440
of accountability and transparency around&nbsp;
the integration of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.520
In fact, I think that JAIC is probably the only&nbsp;
organization that can actually pull this off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.640
And as an artifact of our relationship&nbsp;
with the Dep[uty] Sec[retary of] Def[ense]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.040
it's kind of a natural task for us to take on.
It is through our relationship with the Dep[uty]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.200
Sec[retary of] Def[ense] that we have&nbsp;
access across the department. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.400
that's a really important thing&nbsp;
inside the building here. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.560
given the scale and scope of the defense&nbsp;
enterprise, diving into this task is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.360
for the faint hearted. Certainly, all&nbsp;
spending is accounted for in the Department.&nbsp;

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.960
But when you look at money spent. Looking at what&nbsp;
it was spent on and agreeing to a definition of AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.880
and labeling like specific expenditures as AI&nbsp;
related or not is a really grueling proposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.240
So historically these kinds of tasks are done by&nbsp;
survey and we have an AI executive steering group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.200
here in the Department to help us define kind of&nbsp;
what is AI spending and what isn't AI spending.&nbsp;

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.200
And we'll use that. But, I love this&nbsp;
task because it reveals so much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.000
right? This is like an archetype of the kind of&nbsp;
digital environment that should exist in defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.200
Why can't we answer that question quickly, right?&nbsp;
Why aren't we using AI to get to this level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.320
of management visibility and accountability.
So naturally, we, as the JAIC, I mean, approaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:20.400
this from an AI perspective. So, yes, we have&nbsp;
a task and, okay, we'll get the survey, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.160
how do we actually build this digital environment&nbsp;
where the Department makes data informed decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.360
continuously every day. You don't have to ask&nbsp;
once a year. You can ask any day you want to.&nbsp;

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.440
That's the kind of thing that we're trying to&nbsp;
do across the Department. And there's a quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.760
reformation going on with several of us&nbsp;
in the Department, the Chief Data Officer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.360
the Comptroller, the Dep[uty] Sec[retary of]&nbsp;
Def[ense]'s office. No. And those management&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.280
tools that the department does use, we're&nbsp;
trying to now modernize those and get those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.080
to be much more effective and more useful.
When it comes to just straight up dollars.&nbsp;

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.760
Like how much is being spent on AI. We're&nbsp;
just getting started on this. We have 120&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.680
day task here. But others have estimated based&nbsp;
on just on contracting data, that the portfolio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.520
is on the order of $ 4 to $6 billion in a&nbsp;
defense base of about maybe 670 billion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:14.480
which is maybe it's less than 1%; 0.7% or so. The&nbsp;
JAIC obviously is just one small part of that.&nbsp;

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.720
But if you add up the, the AI expenditures&nbsp;
you still wind up with a really tiny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.000
fraction of the Department's investments. And&nbsp;
so that's one of the things that as we dive into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.680
budgeting and costs, we want to look&nbsp;
at the allocation of that resourcing.&nbsp;

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.600
So, do we have that right? Are we spending&nbsp;
enough on artificial intelligence?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.280
What's the balance between the&nbsp;
services, how much goes into testing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.920
how much is spent on R&amp;D activities or how&nbsp;
much is spent on implementation activities?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.480
So were going to actually have a really good&nbsp;
insight into where our money is spent and what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.600
kind of outcomes we achieve with those resources.
And hopefully your listeners are encouraged by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.320
the fact that, many of us are really working&nbsp;
hard to ensure accountability for delivering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.960
meaningful AI capabilities, measuring the&nbsp;
outcomes, to make sure that we're getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.440
what our investments would imply and then making&nbsp;
the most of taxpayer dollars across the board.&nbsp;

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.160
And so, I know Congress is really&nbsp;
interested in that. As the JAIC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.000
we're really interested in that as well.
Craig: Yeah. Although four months doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.520
sound like a lot of time to get that done.
Gen. Groen: You're absolutely right.&nbsp;

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.920
Craig: One question, presumably you already have&nbsp;
an inventory in some form. How much do you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.600
isn't captured in what you already know? Do&nbsp;
you think that you're already aware of 80%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.080
of what's out there or less than that?
Gen. Groen: Yeah. That's probably a reasonable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:36.880
figure and the rub comes in defining, okay, what&nbsp;
is AI spending and what is not AI spending? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.800
you're building a system and it happens to&nbsp;
have an artificial intelligence component.&nbsp;

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.960
Well, does the cost of that system get&nbsp;
included in the roll up. Those are the kinds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.720
of things that we have to work through now.
So, we're going to do a best effort for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.040
Congress here. And I think the more we automate&nbsp;
this, the better results we're going to get.&nbsp;

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.040
Craig: And does your mandate include&nbsp;
the intelligence communities or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.560
are they looking at things separately?
Gen. Groen: Anything that's funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.560
by the intelligence community,&nbsp;
that's an Intel appropriation,&nbsp;

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.520
we wouldn't touch. We will look at things in&nbsp;
the Department, the National Security Agency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.600
the Defense Intelligence Agency are&nbsp;
elements of the intelligence community,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.880
but their defense agencies. And so, we'll look&nbsp;
at those to see what's appropriate to measure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.040
and what's not appropriate to measure.
I think the intent is to catalog this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.440
within the defense appropriations, not the&nbsp;
intelligence community appropriations. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.200
that's the logic we'll follow and then&nbsp;
we can always adjust if that task changes.&nbsp;

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.040
Craig: you've answered this partly, but I'll go&nbsp;
ahead. General Shanahan brought the JAIC into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:43.360
being, and you're overseeing its second phase&nbsp;
dubbed JAIC, 2.0. Can you describe what that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.280
means? And I've seen you talk about problem&nbsp;
pull and fly away teams. Can you describe for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.880
listeners what you mean by those terms?
Gen. Groen: So, as I said in the,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.720
in the beginning, we are about transformation; transformation of&nbsp;the Department, transformation of our war fighting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.280
transformation of our businesses practices.&nbsp;
And so, the JAIC is only about two years old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.280
effectively. When JAIC 1.0 was established, capital&nbsp;
was generated, some capital was applied and JAIC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.640
1.0 went straight into AI development. Hey, let's&nbsp;
build AIs and let's start seeding the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.600
Let's start showing what's possible. And so, the&nbsp;
JAIC here over the last two years has developed 30&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.360
plus AI products, everything from preventive&nbsp;
maintenance to humanitarian assistance to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.160
medical things like, like pathology recognition,&nbsp;
object detection, stuff like that. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.880
we had great product development expertise,&nbsp;
and that's really important. But as we looked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.160
at this here this past fall, developing&nbsp;
products was not transformational enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.800
because as we develop products, we didn't&nbsp;
have like a transition partner in every case.&nbsp;

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.440
So even if we developed some compelling&nbsp;
technology, there was no guarantee that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.160
somebody was going to grab that technology and&nbsp;
then implement it into a workflow or a use case or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.040
an enterprise somewhere. And we just realized that&nbsp;
building products was not transformational enough.&nbsp;

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.960
And so, we thought about, well, how do&nbsp;
we have to act and operate to achieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.480
transformation? And scale was the kind of the&nbsp;
operative word. And so, what we realized is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.880
we really need to start generating&nbsp;
that tide that lifts all boats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.600
We need to inform organizations about how they&nbsp;
can integrate AI and then help them do so.&nbsp;

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.320
And this starts with things like, helping them&nbsp;
assess their data readiness, helping them get an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.520
understanding of what they need to do first. What&nbsp;
are the steps to actually building an architecture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.080
that you can apply an artificial intelligence&nbsp;
engine to? That's what we're trying to do.&nbsp;

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.840
And so, we recrafted our organization a little&nbsp;
bit. And I want to be clear, we still build AIs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.760
but we're much more we're selective on which&nbsp;
ones we build here in house, in the JAIC. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.480
AI's that we build are more things that are on&nbsp;
the cutting edge, things that that are pushing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.920
the state of the art here in the Department.
But we've shifted a lot of our attention and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:00.560
priority to enabling others to be successful in&nbsp;
the AI business. And so, as we look to enable a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.160
broad swath of AI consumers across the Department,&nbsp;
again, 3 million people, 20 plus agencies,&nbsp;

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.480
we reoriented our own organization&nbsp;
to go out to those organizations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:15.920
to, to help them see where they might be able&nbsp;
to gain efficiency or effectiveness through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:21.760
AI integration. So that's what we, call that a&nbsp;
flyaway team. So, we'll take a team of AI experts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.520
and go meet with the functional experts of the - I'll,&nbsp;
just as an example, the Defense Logistics Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.640
Fantastic agency, tons and tons of data.
Right. They've got a great head start on AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.320
already. So, like reaching into an organization&nbsp;
like that to say, Hey, how can we help? And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.080
when we figure out like how we can help.&nbsp;
Sometimes they don't need any help and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.040
we look to ways to partner, Hey, how can we work&nbsp;
together to achieve something better. Sometimes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.440
all they need is a recommendation on a contract&nbsp;
vehicle and they're off to the races.&nbsp;

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.640
Sometimes they need technical expertise. Sometimes&nbsp;
they need a platform, because they don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.240
a platform to experiment with and try to set up,&nbsp;
get their data in order and get some models&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.360
in work. And so, we give them a platform&nbsp;
environment to work in. So, the response to all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.520
of these different partners across the Department&nbsp;
is different in every case. It's a custom job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.040
every time. But our goal is the same and that is,&nbsp;
to start the wheels of artificial intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.040
turning, especially in the most compelling&nbsp;
places, those places that have lots of data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.000
who have really exciting use cases and are&nbsp;
ready to take the plunge. So, when we talk about&nbsp;

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.200
problem pull, if we have a fly-away team that&nbsp;
goes to sit down with a customer and work through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.920
how can we help them be successful then, then&nbsp;
we have to understand what their problems are.&nbsp;

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.200
And when we get to understanding like some key&nbsp;
elements of their problems, we can take those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.840
problems back to the JAIC, to look at building&nbsp;
our artificial intelligence solutions to those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.840
problems. But because we know who our transition&nbsp;
partner is then, so we know that if it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.920
problem that's important enough that that customer is&nbsp;
 willing to spend some money on it,&nbsp;

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.560
then we know it's a real problem and that helps&nbsp;
us focus our efforts. Again, the JAIC's a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.520
organization, so it helps us focus our resources&nbsp;
against the problems that matter the most.&nbsp;

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.640
Craig: And under the National Defense&nbsp;
Authorization Act, JAIC has been granted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.840
acquisition authority, finally. But it's only&nbsp;
$75 million a year through 2025, unless I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:25.840
mistaken. That sounds very small. Particularly&nbsp;
given that the Booz Allen Hamilton contract was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:32.560
$800 million. What can you do with 75 million?
Doesn't that mean that you'll continue to rely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:37.680
on the General Services Administration,&nbsp;
the Defense Innovation Unit, and other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.160
acquisition authorities for large programs?
Gen. Groen: yeah. Great question. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.720
let me put some context around that. I think.&nbsp;
First, just to make sure that everybody's clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.920
the Booz Allen Hamilton contract, that&nbsp;
was $800 million ceiling over five years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.040
and it's not just for JAIC requirements, that&nbsp;
contract is for services and agencies to leverage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:03.600
their own requirements to get AI integration.
But to talk, just to talk about contracting here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.240
for a minute, getting a contract in place with DOD&nbsp;
is no small feat, right? So, once you have one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:14.320
it's a great enabler. And, and when I look at what&nbsp;
the, what Congress helped us with in the NDAA here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.280
I see two things that are really important.
The first is an acknowledgement that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.840
Department is continuing to push creative&nbsp;
mechanisms to make the DOD a better customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.360
Defense acquisition has been a very trying&nbsp;
process for a long time, to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.920
put it mildly. But the leadership here in&nbsp;
acquisition and sustainment now is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.560
looking to push creative mechanisms to do this.
I mean, the ship of defense acquisition is slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.840
turning and I think this is further evidence&nbsp;
of that. I think we have a long way to go still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.760
in things like software acquisition,&nbsp;
but, this is a good indicator that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.400
things are changing. The second thing that I&nbsp;
see here in this is, this is Congress trusting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.400
the JAIC to execute this initial ceiling.
And we're very grateful for this because I think,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.000
we've got a good dialogue with Congress here&nbsp;
to help understand what our goals are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.040
with this acquisition authority. We're&nbsp;
going to continue to leverage the large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.680
contracting organizations where that's necessary.&nbsp;
So, we still have those resources available to us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.320
things like the Defense Innovation Unit. We have&nbsp;
a presence in Silicon Valley called the Defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.600
Innovation Unit that links specific&nbsp;
problems, in our case, AI problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:25.360
with specific vendors and small companies that can&nbsp;
respond to those problems and those requirements.&nbsp;

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:31.120
But within the JAIC, the acquisition authority&nbsp;
is an opportunity for us to show the same level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.120
of agility in contracting so that we can actually&nbsp;
get to the small, innovative companies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.720
a lot of times don't have the ability to&nbsp;
work with the Department because it's so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.320
hard to work for the Department. So, I think&nbsp;
it's a big win. We're going to look to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.800
this authority. You're right. It's a small&nbsp;
amount in the first year. We hope that we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.800
be successful and so Congress will raise that&nbsp;
limit over time, depending on what our needs are.&nbsp;

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.480
But we want to leverage this to create consortiums,&nbsp;
create like a bidding environment for small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.600
tasks. So that small companies that otherwise have&nbsp;
a really hard time working with the Department of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.520
Defense will be able to do this much more agilely.&nbsp;
We think that this is a great opportunity for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.000
to expand the state-of-the-art and be&nbsp;
more inclusive with a broader set of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.640
small, innovative companies to meet&nbsp;
more requirements inside the Department.&nbsp;

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.040
And if we learn, and this is good, then we'll&nbsp;
continue to grow it. The final thing I'll say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.600
here is, I think that there's some real goodness&nbsp;
here also in using the JAIC and this acquisition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.680
authority to develop a whole new cadre of&nbsp;
acquisition experts who know how to do AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.760
acquisition, they know what they're looking for.
They know what to ask for. They know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.280
kind of terms you put in those kinds of&nbsp;
contracts. So, a cadre of experts who know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.120
AI acquisition and then, we can use that cadre&nbsp;
to spread the wealth, spread the knowledge and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:54.840
help others across the DOD to do this.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.280
Craig:&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to relate all of this to the Joint&nbsp;
Common Foundation, particularly when you talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.200
about working directly with small startups in&nbsp;
Silicon Valley, many of whom are platform plays,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.880
have developed platforms for different aspects&nbsp;
of the machine learning pipeline. Do those, once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:23.040
acquired, go into the Joint Common Foundation?
I mean, how does the Joint Common Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.160
operate and where are you in&nbsp;
putting it together today?&nbsp;

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.800
Gen. Groen: So, the Joint Common Foundation&nbsp;
has been on the priority list for the JAIC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:38.160
right from the beginning. And I think the genesis&nbsp;
of this idea was, so many would-be AI users across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.760
the Department, even if they know what to&nbsp;
do, they don't have a platform to do it on.&nbsp;

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.720
And so, the preponderance of users across&nbsp;
the Department need help just getting started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.080
in AI. Well, we need a place that we can start&nbsp;
working with them. We need a place that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.960
can bring their data. We need a place that&nbsp;
we can condition their data and label their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:05.120
data or, whatever other work we need to do.
We need a place that we can store algorithms and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.000
once developed, maybe share algorithms. This&nbsp;
idea of clustering, right? Where if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.480
similar problem sets, you can often use&nbsp;
the same model or the same algorithm. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.960
just train it with different data and it works.
We've done that many times here within the JAIC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.840
to move an algorithm from one scenario to another&nbsp;
that has a very similar problem. We're able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.400
do that really quickly. We needed a place that we can catalog those algorithms, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.280
we can store them, where we can store training&nbsp;
data for different phenomena, for example.&nbsp;

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.480
So, the Joint Common Foundation has always&nbsp;
been the picture of that capability, but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:44.080
hadn't built it. So, over the last year, we've&nbsp;
really made a concerted effort to start building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.200
the platform. We are not creating a private&nbsp;
data center and spending lots of money on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.280
building or, large numbers of servers, et cetera.
This is all built on a commercial cloud and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.880
all built in really close teaming with, for&nbsp;
example, the Air force's platform one team,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.440
really close teaming with special operations&nbsp;
and some of the networks that they operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.760
Really close teaming with USDI and the Chief&nbsp;
Data Officer and several other key players,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.840
the research and engineering organization here&nbsp;
inside the Department. We are putting our heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.360
together to figure out what is the best, most&nbsp;
economical way to present this capability to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.440
broad spectrum of users across the Department.&nbsp;
We're going to work together to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.200
to ensure that we're getting the most&nbsp;
cost effective, the most efficient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:36.320
eliminating redundancies by planning together to&nbsp;
build this common foundation fabric, if you will.&nbsp;

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:43.040
That's that has a significant node that's built by&nbsp;
the JAIC here for AI work, but also leverages all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.000
of the other tools associated with a common cloud&nbsp;
environment. So, we think that JAIC is as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.800
important AI component of that fabric, but the&nbsp;
way that we're thinking about the Joint Common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:58.000
Foundation is actually growing to encompass&nbsp;
more elements of foundational information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.480
and foundational data across Department.
That's really exciting for me. We're creating a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.360
Dev[elopment,] Sec[urity and] Op[eration]s environment here&nbsp;
in the JAIC for AI development. So, if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.120
services or organizations that don't have&nbsp;
a platform, but have some ideas and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.160
want a place to experiment, we're&nbsp;
building that environment for them.&nbsp;

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.600
So, we're talking to them a number of the&nbsp;
services, several of the agencies about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.240
okay, how do we get this platform? Once you&nbsp;
have the platform we put models, we put tools,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.480
we put toolsets from multiple vendors. We use&nbsp;
multiple components of commercial cloud. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.560
a place where we can now put training&nbsp;
information or education information.&nbsp;

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.520
We can put simulations on there. There's&nbsp;
a lot of things now that don't have a home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.920
and that has been enough of a deterrent so that&nbsp;
we don't achieve those capabilities. Now we can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:46.000
those in a scaled common cost-effective way. And&nbsp;
so that's the core of the Joint Common Foundation.&nbsp;

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.720
As we move forward here, we think that'll evolve&nbsp;
into a model catalog, right? Where now we know where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.040
models that have been developed across the&nbsp;
Department exist, so that we can repurpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.000
them for other consumers. We know where those&nbsp;
data sets are. It's almost a lending library&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.560
for the AI efforts across the Department. And&nbsp;
more importantly, as we move down the road to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:12.720
things like the Joint All Domain Command and&nbsp;
Control program, where we start integrating AIs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.720
across services and across warfighting functions.
This allows us to build like a Schengen zone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.920
right? Visa free, where you can travel from&nbsp;
one network environment to another without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.720
having to show your passport. Taking the&nbsp;
security credentials, for example, from one place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.920
in a container, into another part of the network,&nbsp;
another part of the Joint Common Foundation.&nbsp;

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:39.840
And we think that is the key to this integrated&nbsp;
war fighting. So, the whole approach to the common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.040
foundation, what that does for disadvantaged&nbsp;
users who don't have a place to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.840
and what it does for operational war fighting&nbsp;
on the higher end and everything in between,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.280
we just think is really important.&nbsp;

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:57.360
This fiscal year, especially we're really going&nbsp;
to move into implementation. We expect to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.720
what we call initial operating capability by&nbsp;
the end of February. And then I've challenged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.520
the team here in the JCF team that. We&nbsp;
want to add a capability every month.&nbsp;

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:13.440
We want a new capability to drop every month.&nbsp;
This is a moving and expanding capability set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.160
that we'll just continue to add on and we'll&nbsp;
invite other people to add capabilities on it, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.680
So, it gives us a whole data ecosystem&nbsp;
that now can be used by large swaths of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.000
the Department that currently don't have that.
Craig: Would the Department have open contracts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.400
with these platforms and then put&nbsp;
them into the JCF so that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.680
in a service who wants to build something&nbsp;
can say, oh great, there's a platform for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.120
labeling and we've already got it licensed so&nbsp;
I can log into it and start operating on it.&nbsp;

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.840
Is that how it's going to work?
Gen. Groen: So, it could work that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.920
Elements could work that way. One of the important&nbsp;
aspects here is the data itself, right? So, if, if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.880
it's Department of d=Defense data, it's government&nbsp;
intellectual property, and we want to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.200
that we're protecting that intellectual property.
And so, what we're not willing to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.920
give our data away and then pay for algorithms&nbsp;
derived from our data, for example. So, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.320
JCF could be a place where government data could&nbsp;
exist and contractors could come onto the platform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.680
to develop algorithms, for&nbsp;
example, and then generate a model.&nbsp;

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.320
And if we have more sensitive data and, as&nbsp;
we grow, we can start operating at a higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.720
classification level, then that's a place that&nbsp;
the government has oversight of that we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.360
ensure the security of our department data.
It is the most precious resource we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.560
We have a ton of it. And right now, it's&nbsp;
just, in a lot of different places. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.520
working here with the Chief Data Officer&nbsp;
for how we protect our IP and how we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:44.320
the most economical response from vendors.
So, we can bring in vendors onto our platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.040
let them do work there and then preserve&nbsp;
the result. You could work at the other way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.440
if conditions allow that. And so, we're looking&nbsp;
at all these different options, but yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.720
the JCF will be the place that we can do this&nbsp;
in support of programs across the Department.&nbsp;

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.880
It prevents everybody from&nbsp;
having to build their own.&nbsp;

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.800
Craig: And you say it's not quite&nbsp;
ready. What stage of development&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.280
is it at now? And what's the timeline?
Gen. Groen: Functional today. We haven't opened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:14.560
it up for business yet, but, we tend to open at&nbsp;
the end of February and then we'll upgrade it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.560
Plan is to upgrade it once a month after that.
Craig: There's a new National Artificial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:24.640
Intelligence Initiative Office in the White&nbsp;
House's Office of Science and Technology Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:30.240
What will the JAIC's relationship be to that office?
Gen. Groen: So, we don't know yet what form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:36.080
that will take. It's welcome news. If it's an&nbsp;
inter-agency effort and the Department of Defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.440
is a participant, then we will likely be the&nbsp;
representative for the Department of Defense.&nbsp;

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.040
We've worked historically with things&nbsp;
like the White House Technology Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.440
We've worked several initiatives with the&nbsp;
Department of Energy and some of the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.200
departments across the government. So, we're used to partnering in this space.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.800
If we can share Department of Defense models&nbsp;
and algorithms, perhaps that would facilitate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.240
some other elements of the US government.
Those are all the kinds of things that are on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:07.440
table as we look to partner. Still undefined kind of&nbsp;
like exactly what we would do in that environment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.880
but we have a history of working partnerships across the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.880
We can do that pretty seamlessly. And if&nbsp;
the Department of Defense is part of that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:20.240
then it makes sense for us to be that node.
Craig: Well, thank you, General Groen. Presumably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.120
you'll be in this role for a while, and&nbsp;
this is a space that moves very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.720
I'd love to have a conversation with you again&nbsp;
in a year or so to see where the JAIC is.&nbsp;

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.160
Gen. Groen: I really appreciate the opportunity.&nbsp;
Great to have a conversation with you and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.600
just knowing the content of the blog and the kind&nbsp;
of people that you have on it, I'm honored to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.920
here at all. If I can be further used to you,&nbsp;
I'm very, very happy to move the dialogue.&nbsp;

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.280
It's obviously very important to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.520
Craig: That's it for this week's podcast. I&nbsp;
want to thank General Groen for his time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.320
If you want to learn more about what we talked&nbsp;
about today, you can find a transcript of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:10.160
show on our website. That's eye-on.ai.
I also encourage you to listen to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:20.320
podcast series we've done for the National&nbsp;
Security Commission on AI at www.NSCAI.gov.&nbsp;

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:41.840
And remember, the singularity may not be near, but AI&nbsp;
is about to change your world. So, pay attention.
