00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.760
we find that you know classical techniques for AI&nbsp;
are thousand times cheaper and a thousand times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.320
faster than geni but when you get to the point&nbsp;
where you might otherwise get a person involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.520
especially if the classical AI is right on the&nbsp;
confidence bubble where it's pretty sure it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.840
not a problem but it needs a second pair of eyes&nbsp;
to be sure geni can provide that second pair of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.280
eyes and certainly that's a good tiebreaker&nbsp;
it can take for some kinds of Investigations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.640
when you talk about either anti-money laundering&nbsp;
investigations or fraud alerts or other types of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.000
compliance um activity monitoring the amount&nbsp;
of work that people do and how manual it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.040
be is just unbelievable it saves a lot of effort&nbsp;
simply to pull all this information from a wide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.120
variety of sources and put it into the form where&nbsp;
it's actionable hi I'm Craig Smith and this is I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:58.040
on AI in this episode I speak with Peter cousins&nbsp;
the CTO at work Fusion about the company's focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.280
on intelligent automation and digital workers for&nbsp;
anti-financial Crime Solutions Peter talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.760
leveraging generative AI alongside classical&nbsp;
AI for enhanced fraud detection and compliance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.000
particularly in the Realms of sanction screening&nbsp;
adverse media analysis and know your customer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.560
processes within the financial services sector&nbsp;
Peter offered insights into the evolving landscape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.400
of AI technology and combating Financial crime I&nbsp;
hope you find the conversation as interesting as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.120
I did I start by having you introduce yourself&nbsp;
and give uh a little of the background of how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.800
you got to work fusion and then we'll talk about&nbsp;
uh generative Ai and financial services so I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.640
Peter cousins I'm the CTO at work fusion um I&nbsp;
have all the product functions in my team from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.960
design and product management to engineering QA&nbsp;
and Cloud operations I've been with the company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.160
for a couple years now um almost three actually&nbsp;
before that I was CTO of bottomline Technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.400
which is a half a billion dollar a year SAS&nbsp;
banking software company and before that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.560
was at IBM after the acquisition of Unica where&nbsp;
I was the CTO and and tell us about work Fusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.080
what what does uh work Fusion do so work Fusion&nbsp;
is a intelligent automation company that focuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.320
specifically on what we call our digital workers&nbsp;
which is a series of um AI solution Technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.440
for anti-financial Crime so talking about things&nbsp;
like sanction screening um entity screening like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.360
pep and adverse media kyc um and all different&nbsp;
kinds of Investigations and activity monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.600
yeah and because I I've been talking to people&nbsp;
about the use of generative AI in in financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.040
services and what I've what I've heard is that&nbsp;
um while it's being applied for productivity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:23.400
gains in in u the back office or in HR functions&nbsp;
uh a lot of financial services uh are not using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.640
it in fraud detection and that sort of thing&nbsp;
for compliance issues is is is that right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.320
and why is that so I think people naturally are&nbsp;
concerned about um and we call this the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.000
office this uh you know anti-financial crime&nbsp;
uh units um they're they're always concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.440
about errors they just can't afford really to&nbsp;
make any mistakes at all so they're willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.280
to sacrifice a little bit of automation for&nbsp;
certainty and the the way many people have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.120
tried to deal with that is just by avoiding&nbsp;
generative AI waiting for it to mature for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.840
but um we increasingly see people willing to use&nbsp;
generative AI in a kind of Triad with people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.320
you know classic AI functions and so that's where&nbsp;
we think it's the best because you can leverage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.240
it in a kind of panel model to get certainty um&nbsp;
and you know maybe not so much replace classic AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.160
yet but handle a lot of the things that otherwise&nbsp;
would have gone to people without having to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.840
people or to go to people for just final approval&nbsp;
and can you give us a a use case and and describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.760
when you say digital workers I mean everyone is&nbsp;
talking right now about building agents uh is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.080
uh are you talking about agents or are you talking&nbsp;
about tools that that humans use so um It's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.200
combination of both so as much as possible when&nbsp;
we say digital worker we mean that it's capable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.560
of doing a complete job end to end so that's&nbsp;
every way you know you get the data it's how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.560
you manipulate the data analyze the data um you&nbsp;
know how you you know make decisions or enforce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.000
rules and standards and practices um and H how&nbsp;
do you know what you don't know and get a person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.640
involved when it's necessary in order to ensure&nbsp;
a 100% accurate outcome but then how you write up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.480
uh the decision right it's got to be completely&nbsp;
defensible and explainable and understandable it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.120
can't be some kind of technical metric it's&nbsp;
got to be a narrative that colleagues could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.360
understand the boss can understand Regulators can&nbsp;
understand and and that explainability issue is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.440
problem with generative AI because not even people&nbsp;
that built it can explain how it works really but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.200
you can show the work the showing the work I think&nbsp;
is the key so you know if you're able to say you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.320
know this is a fact that I used to determine that&nbsp;
we could close this alert as a false positive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.880
I can show you where I pulled that fact from and&nbsp;
I can highlight the passage and show it in context&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.000
so that the person can understand it and it&nbsp;
either is a great accelerator for them making the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.680
decision themselves or it's a a way of trusting&nbsp;
an automated outcome uh so can you walk us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.880
through a a use case uh so that the audience has&nbsp;
a better grasp of what we're talking about so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.680
simplest type of use case would be what we call&nbsp;
sanction screening right so especially with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.640
the Ukraine war and all the sanctions that came&nbsp;
out of it there's a huge Spike um in the number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.160
entities and the number of transactions that could&nbsp;
be subject to sanction and they need to be checked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.400
to make sure that they're not before the activity&nbsp;
is allowed to continue and the problem is there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.040
a huge number of false positives in in all these&nbsp;
domains there's a structural problem with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.960
Upstream alerting systems they they have you know&nbsp;
a millisecond to make a decision they have very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.560
little information to go on they cast the widest&nbsp;
net possible um problem is it creates the needle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:13.520
and a Hy stack effect so the primary P purpose of&nbsp;
our digital workers is to gather those alerts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.240
if it's easy to make the decision because the you&nbsp;
know the the wide net that was cast when looked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.000
at just a little bit more closely you can tell&nbsp;
that it was a false positive to do so and close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.520
those alerts without any further scrutiny um and&nbsp;
a good example might be you you have a name that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.920
embedded in a street and the sanctioned entity is&nbsp;
a company um so just because they share a word or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.720
two in common with a street name doesn't mean&nbsp;
that this payment or entity can't can't be um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.040
can't proceed so you know being able to look at&nbsp;
that know it's an address know that it's a street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.280
name know that it's not related to the company&nbsp;
or entity in question let's you take other easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.960
ones off the table right um on top of that you&nbsp;
then you have to start thinking about what does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:07.000
a person do uh a person uses judgment and you&nbsp;
know looks at names and says yeah yeah there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.600
may be a number of words in this name that are&nbsp;
in common with a sanction entity but these words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:19.760
aren't important right they're common words like&nbsp;
bank or you know um LLC or Corp or you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.600
noise words right so doing that kinds of stop word&nbsp;
analysis can also help you take easy ones off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.360
table when you're done with that then you start&nbsp;
doing investigation work right you start you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:37.720
um either using curated data sources like Thompson&nbsp;
Reuters Lexus Nexus and the like or you use open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.760
sources and use Google and Microsoft to search the&nbsp;
broader web and and gather facts to support uh the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.720
either approval or disapproval of the a business&nbsp;
activity so having all that done by machine is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.720
certainly possible and and the important part is&nbsp;
that it at a point where there's an ambiguity that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.040
can't be resolved through any of these techniques&nbsp;
that it's time to get a person involved to take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.840
second look at it but at least all the digital&nbsp;
paper chase has been completed before they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.560
asked to make a decision and the most important&nbsp;
elements are highlighted and stack ranked so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.560
they can make the decision very quickly there&nbsp;
are a lot of other AI systems or flavors of AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:25.400
before you use generative AI why why generative&nbsp;
generative AI so we we use a combination um we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:32.560
find that you know classical techniques uh for&nbsp;
AI can are you know thousand times cheaper and uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.080
you know a thousand times faster than gen yeah&nbsp;
but when you get to the point where you might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.320
otherwise get a person involved um especially&nbsp;
if you know the the classical AI is right on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.760
confidence bubble where it's pretty sure it's not&nbsp;
a problem but it needs a second pair of eyes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:56.440
be sure sometimes gen can uh provide that second&nbsp;
pair of eyes and you know for certainly at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.000
close calls that's a good tiebreaker um and if&nbsp;
it can't then a person gets involved as the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.600
I was talking to a company the other day their&nbsp;
product is called Argus it Maps relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:17.040
between entities and it's being used to track&nbsp;
for example uh components and and where they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.480
being sold so that you know you're not selling&nbsp;
through a front company to a sanctioned entity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.320
do you guys do anything like that sure so one&nbsp;
of the things that you do is you analyze um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.480
what's called ultimate beneficial ownership to see&nbsp;
who controls some of these entities because who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:43.400
controls them is as is as important as who they&nbsp;
are at least on the surface um so yeah following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.440
that kind of ubl um you know backward analysis to&nbsp;
see who's really pulling the strings is one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.200
important elements but also using things like the&nbsp;
open search and the curated data sources to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:03.640
for additional connections between entities is&nbsp;
also really important yeah uh but but again geni&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:14.240
is not necessarily the best tool for that um you&nbsp;
know it it tends to hallucinate uh they're more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:22.840
powerful kinds of search uh unless you you know I&nbsp;
was talking to a company yesterday that's that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:33.120
building its own index of the web um outside&nbsp;
of the big search engines uh that that's very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:42.000
curated uh according to Authority and accuracy and&nbsp;
that sort of thing so so you you can use their gen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.040
model uh to search and be confident that that&nbsp;
the the response that's coming back is grounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:59.240
uh how do you get around the the hallucination&nbsp;
problem if you're using gen AI in this capacity so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.480
one way is to just use the hybrid approach right&nbsp;
and the hybrid approach is the the the Triad I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:12.840
was talking about with people and classical Ai and&nbsp;
not just geni um so that you have you know a panel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.600
essentially making a decision instead of just one&nbsp;
element making a decision but it's it's also not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.480
to just try to use it to replace all these types&nbsp;
of functions right so another way in which we use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:32.080
gen is when one thing that's very important for us&nbsp;
is being able to um extract structured data from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:42.160
unstructured natural stock and so one way in which&nbsp;
we use gen is for these types of documents you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:49.800
need to train the models with supervised examples&nbsp;
labeled documents and um you know it's pretty good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:56.480
at actually creating the labeled documents from&nbsp;
zero shot but what we still do is we have people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.840
review the labeling to make sure that the labeling&nbsp;
is accurate and then the labeled documents are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.480
used to train the classical Ai and the classical&nbsp;
AI is what's used for the heavy lifting of most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.920
of the activities of runtime so really using gen&nbsp;
more to replace the manual labor involved with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.360
the supervised labeling than to replace it for&nbsp;
doing the processing at one time and you are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:29.880
agents they they they you they break something&nbsp;
into subtasks and then act on the sub test and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:39.320
then bring all that back uh to the human uh for&nbsp;
review how how are you building are you building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:46.280
those agents yourself or are you licensing agents&nbsp;
that that other companies have build so the agents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.400
themselves are are what we build and most of&nbsp;
these like I said are the the heart of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:59.200
is not gen it's it's classic AI um and but what&nbsp;
we do find is that there's other areas where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.840
of interaction with The Human Experience is quite&nbsp;
useful for Gen right so um one way in which people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.560
might steer our product is by creating rules right&nbsp;
it's it's always better to use a rule when it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.440
a directed decision that's based upon standards&nbsp;
and procedures and there otherwise you're trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.040
to you know train a decision model um to ASM&nbsp;
totically approach the rule as opposed to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.240
rule and and so knowing when to use you know an&nbsp;
AI model and when to use a rule is is an important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.240
part of what we do but when you are trying to&nbsp;
ingest these standards and practices they're often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.880
in um you know documents that are given to people&nbsp;
for training um likewise if a person is trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.360
sit down it may be quite easy to author a rule&nbsp;
it's kind of similar to entering formulas into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.120
an Excel spreadsheet but it's still intimidating&nbsp;
to defeat the blank page the first time you try it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.480
so to be able to express in natural language the&nbsp;
rule you're trying to give like something like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:03.880
know I want to escalate immediately all payments&nbsp;
over a million dollars that are a real-time grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.640
settlement payment where the pay is either&nbsp;
in Russia or within you know 250 miles of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.520
Russian border you know writing that rule might be&nbsp;
intimidating for someone the first time they sit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:19.120
down right it's just like if you ever can remember&nbsp;
back the first time you used Lotus 123 or Excel it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.360
was probably a little intimidating even if you're&nbsp;
just trying to do something simple like create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.080
a p&amp;l or a budget so um having the ability of&nbsp;
talking to the generative Ai and saying that's my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.320
rule and then seeing it appear in the structured&nbsp;
form on the screen where you can just approve it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.280
and say yes I see how it's unambiguous now and&nbsp;
that's exactly what I meant it's a great way of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.960
interacting with no code features of a platform&nbsp;
to steer Its Behavior yeah and and your clients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:54.720
are big financial institutions uh are you do you&nbsp;
have a platform that that uh that they log into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:05.240
and use or are you more of a a consulting company&nbsp;
that's Building thepoke Solutions um uh that then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:12.960
run on Prem I mean that's another issue with all&nbsp;
of this uh kind of data is that a lot of companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:20.800
for compliance reasons can't allow to leave the&nbsp;
premises how do you work so we we've put a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.880
of energy into building a platform and we call it&nbsp;
work Ai and it's what all the digital workers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:33.040
based upon and it's what provides these Primitives&nbsp;
like getting data rules document extraction you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.800
know machine learning models building the ux&nbsp;
for the human in the loop collaboration and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.960
so on all of these things are done using the work&nbsp;
AI platform and the digital workers leverage all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.160
these Primitives in order to you know do this&nbsp;
end to-end automation that I'm talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.640
and then some people um use just the platform&nbsp;
and they build their own custom digital worker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.920
but still on the platform using these kind of no&nbsp;
code features so we've actually got a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.280
customers that are not in financial services that&nbsp;
are still important to us that that use just the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:10.280
platform but uh every bank that we deal with looks&nbsp;
at the standard digital workers first because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.040
lower risk and faster time to value and it's&nbsp;
often an area where they have a lot of pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.040
today especially with the bump and sanctions that&nbsp;
we had last year everyone was trying to deal with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.640
how do we handle this you know dramatic increase&nbsp;
and sanctions alerts and they couldn't hire people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:32.280
fast enough especially with the you know the great&nbsp;
resignation and labor shortages and the the work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.480
of you know waiting through the Hast stack looking&nbsp;
for the needles it's just not fun right so a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.120
of people don't want to do the work and as soon as&nbsp;
they get good at it they wind up moving on so it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.880
a Perpetual problem trying to keep enough people&nbsp;
uh on the problem and that's where we start but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.680
the the heart of it is a platform part the second&nbsp;
part of the thing that you asked was what about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:00.280
the deployment apologies so you know again what&nbsp;
we've done is we we need to look at what these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:07.360
Enterprise customers need and we offer the product&nbsp;
as a SAS manage service type of offering so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.040
know smaller smaller companies can be put into a&nbsp;
multi-tenant environment but larger institutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.840
if we are going to manage it for them it's always&nbsp;
with a uh dedicated virtual private Cloud for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.800
yeah we also allow people to put it into their&nbsp;
own virtual private Cloud just as easily and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.160
support people running it in a kind of classic&nbsp;
data center on Prem so we we support all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.840
deployment apologies for for customers yeah I just&nbsp;
had a conversation before this with somebody at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:42.720
consulting company that that works on generative&nbsp;
AI for financial services and and he was saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:52.000
that they use Azure because Azure has all he&nbsp;
built-in protections as opposed to uh you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:03.600
using some other uh Cloud inter mediary to reach&nbsp;
uh uh proprietary models like gbd4 is is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.640
the sort of thing that that you're talking about&nbsp;
when you say private virtual Cloud yeah so um you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.640
know all the major Cloud companies have virtual&nbsp;
private Cloud where it's a dedicated environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.120
with very controlled network access and very&nbsp;
controlled resources that are only for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.680
entity that controls that virtual private Cloud&nbsp;
so it's not comingled at any layer um with anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:33.160
else's information um you know so we can create a&nbsp;
virtual private Cloud on behalf of a single bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.760
but Banks can also have their own virtual private&nbsp;
cloud with a bunch of their systems in it they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.560
often running in some kind of hybrid model between&nbsp;
classic data centers and these new virtual private&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.160
clouds that are connected to them with you know&nbsp;
um pointto Point secure networks you you have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:57.200
paper uh on fighting fraud uh with AI can can you&nbsp;
sort of walk us through the thesis of that paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:07.000
so essentially the idea is that it's mostly in the&nbsp;
curated experiences that are combining people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.840
gen where the intersection becomes important so um&nbsp;
and there's areas where the Gen is going to even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.640
exceed some of the capabilities of the classic&nbsp;
AI even if it has other limitations and has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:26.120
other kinds of cost and performance constraints&nbsp;
so you know if you look at adverse media for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.880
example that's that's one of the problems that&nbsp;
we also solve right and when you know when a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.160
company is doing business with a new entity they&nbsp;
want to know is there any dirt out there on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:42.280
entity that means they don't want to do business&nbsp;
with them and this can take many forms it can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:49.080
things like arrest records and lawsuits and it can&nbsp;
be things like um high-profile departures it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:56.000
be you know uh Personnel of the company being uh&nbsp;
convicted of either a financial crime or a serious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.960
you know moral crime that disqualifies them as a&nbsp;
potential customer business partner vendor Etc and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.520
so it's a it's a hard problem because you know&nbsp;
as you can imagine you know if you Google your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.960
own name you'll find many articles out there and&nbsp;
so you have to go through a process of first of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.960
all targeting the search so you're not picking&nbsp;
up so much noise second that you have to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.040
through every article and understand is this&nbsp;
really The Entity that we're concerned with or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.200
is it a similarly named entity or even the same&nbsp;
name entity in a different jurisdiction right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.240
then it's how is this entity involved in this&nbsp;
article so there could be an article about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.720
financial crime where you're the victim uh not the&nbsp;
perpetrator and so obviously that shouldn't count&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.440
against you um or there could be a an arrest&nbsp;
report where you were arrested for disorderly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.160
conduct um because you at a political protest&nbsp;
and uh that's certainly not disqualifying either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:03.400
so you know the these these things uh take a lot&nbsp;
of time so our classic models use classic NLP in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.600
order to solve these problems one way in which gen&nbsp;
can be helpful uh is whenever there's an article&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.680
that really can't be definitively ascertained um&nbsp;
gen can take a crack at it and it can follow some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:23.880
transitive references across a document that are&nbsp;
difficult for classic NP to resolve right so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.040
know as a person you have no problem following&nbsp;
these transitive references across an entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.360
document the the pronouns the subtle Illusions&nbsp;
and so on and sometimes these things even span&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.000
documents they can refer back to an article that&nbsp;
came out in the news yesterday uh assuming you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.760
read it or you can click on the link and you&nbsp;
can go read that so gen tends to be very good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:53.160
at pulling that information together it's also&nbsp;
when used properly can show the work and that work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.600
that's shown can be passed through the classic&nbsp;
Model again to refine the results further which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:05.960
models do you guys use we focus on three different&nbsp;
models right now um we we wind up having a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.080
you know things in the platform where we have to&nbsp;
make it pluggable because we have to accommodate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.280
our customers right so we don't just focus on&nbsp;
Azure for example as you were saying earlier we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:23.120
also support gcp Google cloud and um and Amazon&nbsp;
it's just uh you know the cost of doing business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.680
because people are going to make strategic bets on&nbsp;
one cloud provider versus another and they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.440
want you you know bending their operation to your&nbsp;
will they want you to adapt to their operation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.880
it's the same thing with llms right so if&nbsp;
someone's an Azure shop they'd like to use the you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:45.600
know uh open AI technology you know uh as hosted&nbsp;
through azer um if they're a Google shop they'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:52.000
like to use the Google Technologies right the palm&nbsp;
and and the upcoming Gemini some customers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.440
extremely conservative as we've also said and they&nbsp;
want a completely private uh large language model&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:05.280
uh mistol is the one that we're focused on for&nbsp;
the private use cases so yeah it's got to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.240
pluggable at every layer at the cloud layer&nbsp;
deployment topology layer at the llm layer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:19.560
and and with the open source for example mrr do&nbsp;
you um do do you create an instance of the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:28.560
and fine-tune it on their data or are you just&nbsp;
accessing it the the open source model through AP&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.040
I how how do you do that well first you know&nbsp;
it's um there's a technology we use called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:42.080
Lang chain um I know if you've heard of it but for&nbsp;
pluggability layer LMS yeah and um and then we we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.040
don't just plug in the models but we also curate&nbsp;
different kinds of prompting and information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:55.280
pipelining into the models depending upon the&nbsp;
the the LM in question um and yes in some cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:03.720
you know further training um again the LM or just&nbsp;
providing more example data in the mix uh is a key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:12.880
uh to getting it to perform what are some of the&nbsp;
classes of of financial crime the the sort of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:21.560
the most of your customers are are facing or are&nbsp;
grappling with there must be you know in the bell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:28.320
curve sort of in the middle of it there what what&nbsp;
what kinds of crimes are they working on so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.840
the first big ones and that are the easiest&nbsp;
ones to get started with are the sanctions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.080
pep screening adverse media screening whe and the&nbsp;
sanctions whether it's transactions whether it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.400
entities that are being onboarded that's the easy&nbsp;
ones to do because there's a lot of volume there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:51.640
a lot of regulatory pressure that's increasing&nbsp;
workloads and it's very it's very standardized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:58.400
uh in general compared to other types of&nbsp;
financial crime fighting the second one is kyc so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:05.640
kyc is just it's an enormous problem um there's&nbsp;
a lot of subtlety to the work that has to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:15.600
done um and you know we we see that being a big&nbsp;
pocket of spend within Banks we have some banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:23.960
have thousands of people doing kyc in one form&nbsp;
or another so um we're we're really uh proud of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:31.120
what we've been doing in what we call pkc and pkc&nbsp;
stands the p for Perpetual um there's been talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.560
about this in the past in the industry but it's&nbsp;
actually there's been some pretty high-profile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:43.600
failures on pkc and the reason was that most of&nbsp;
the energy went into acquiring the the data the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:51.040
signal that could be a problem but not in actually&nbsp;
automatically acting upon that data or signal and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.640
as a result they're just created a huge backlog&nbsp;
of case work that would no one was ever getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:01.680
to and they would just revert to doing the period&nbsp;
perodic refreshes every few years or you know more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.800
or less depending upon the risk profile of the&nbsp;
customer just doing a complete case review and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.760
it's actually terrible because you actually had&nbsp;
data that showed you you had a problem so you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.560
a you should have known and you should have acted&nbsp;
kind of problem even though you didn't have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:23.400
capacity to do so so what we've focused on is how&nbsp;
can we actually look at the events and determine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.960
that an event has either been seen before um and&nbsp;
so therefore doesn't need to be looked at again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.320
or it is not it's a lowrisk signal and with just&nbsp;
some subtle analysis can be determined that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.720
not a problem and taken off the table so that all&nbsp;
you're left with is high-risk signals and then to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.720
be able to actually when a when a high-risk signal&nbsp;
is present um be able to completely run a straight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:53.080
through process on the kyc itself for a low-risk&nbsp;
entity at least and um be able to take that off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.760
the table entirely unless there's something&nbsp;
to see here so you know k kyc it's an enormous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:06.920
problem but if you can get the lowrisk signals&nbsp;
and entities off the table you can reduce it by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:13.400
up to 80% and that could be you know an enormous&nbsp;
savings um it also can allow you to fundamentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:19.040
move the needle on risk because I think a lot of&nbsp;
people feel like kyc is a bit of a check the boox&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.160
regulatory exercise and doesn't fun fundamentally&nbsp;
move it but when you're responding to things in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:31.400
real time it actually can save you quite a lot of&nbsp;
bit a lot of trouble can you give a an example of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:38.240
a success of uh you know in the kyc space where&nbsp;
something popped up and you and you prevented a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:45.200
bank from engaging with somebody that was a&nbsp;
problem sure I mean it it happens every day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:54.040
right so it's finding out that um someone actually&nbsp;
has ties to a drug cartel or you know finding out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:00.000
that someone is actually a Russian oligarch&nbsp;
even though they presented a UK passport when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.400
they open the account um and stopping the bank&nbsp;
from doing business with them and you know not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:12.040
just you know one uh one point for the good guys&nbsp;
when those things happen but it also if the bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.400
doesn't stop it um the finds exposure is enormous&nbsp;
what's the throughput on the platform because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:28.040
they're dealing with hundreds if not thousands&nbsp;
of entities a day uh in in with this uh pkc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:39.280
uh it's it's a realtime monitoring I guess uh so&nbsp;
how does the you know the bank has the platform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:51.440
they upload uh a a bunch of documentation um and&nbsp;
then what happens the platform goes out does a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.440 --> 00:30:01.920
search does an analysis presents stuff to one of&nbsp;
their compliant people who reviews it but then is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:09.320
continually monitoring uh the keywords or whatever&nbsp;
for that customer and if something comes along the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:15.080
compliance officer gets an alert I mean how it&nbsp;
just how does that work so one way it can work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.720
is simply doing what a person would do but doing&nbsp;
it very quickly right and doing it without a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:27.120
touch um and pulling the information looking&nbsp;
at the information checking against the file&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:34.080
um doing trans action analysis doing you know a&nbsp;
news analysis Etc and then nothing to see here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:41.480
it's done you're done for the day um it can be&nbsp;
more powerful when you have uh curated information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.680
providers that actually also have an event driven&nbsp;
capability so for example when we work with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:54.720
Thompson Reuters they have a continuous monitoring&nbsp;
facility and that continuous monitoring facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.840
rather than us having to repeat the entire cycle&nbsp;
for the entities in the population on on a rapid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:07.000
but still somewhat periodic basis even if you're&nbsp;
saying periodic is a day it's periodic um we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.160
able to go to them and find only the what's new&nbsp;
over the last 24 hours over the last eight hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.880
um which is much more scalable than having to&nbsp;
repeat the entire process and like you say some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:26.280
of these um companies have millions if not tens&nbsp;
of millions and reaching a 100 million entities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.920
in the relationship portfolio so it is important&nbsp;
that it be as scalable as possible are you is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:39.680
US government one of your customers because this&nbsp;
sounds uh very similar to to what the intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.840
communities spend their time doing so we we have&nbsp;
been working with Partners um into the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.360
channel it's complex to get into the government&nbsp;
Channel um and we're hoping to do more in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:57.040
space primarily though today it's been Banks&nbsp;
is there something I'm not talking about that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.040
that's important to the story well one thing&nbsp;
we could talk about is investigations and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.680
you know when the investigation does involve more&nbsp;
interactive uh session with a with an investigator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.520
as opposed to purely the digital worker maybe&nbsp;
that would be a good thing to talk about yeah yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:21.560
we'll tell me about that so um some investigations&nbsp;
um you're going to want to have a person involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.240
but you know it can take for some some kinds of&nbsp;
Investigations when you're talking about either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:34.800
anti-money laundering investigations or fraud&nbsp;
alerts or other types of compliance um activity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:41.120
monitoring you know the the amount of work&nbsp;
that people do and how manual it can be is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.600
unbelievable right so you got people downloading&nbsp;
transaction data and doing pivot tables in Excel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.120
and trying to look at you know whether there&nbsp;
are unusual transactions and whether there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.960
is a high percentage of cash transactions whether&nbsp;
there appear to be any circular payment structures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:04.320
or other kinds of structuring in place and you&nbsp;
know it saves a lot of effort simply to pull all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:10.880
this information from a wide variety of sources&nbsp;
and put it into the form where it's actionable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:18.160
without having this kind of excel kind of uh&nbsp;
step in the process and many people especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.240
with these high-risk investigations they'd much&nbsp;
rather see a dosier that's been assembled by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:30.800
digital worker and have that dossier stack rank&nbsp;
the most important factors right and so the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.040
important factors obviously would be things&nbsp;
that uh haven't been seen before at least for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:43.160
this particular customer it would be things that&nbsp;
are the most uh significant red flags as defined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:50.400
by you know various standards and procedures or&nbsp;
or models and which things are the most anomalous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:56.680
right there unusual activity that clearly merits&nbsp;
a closer look all these types of things can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.520
stacked ranked and then the investigator can&nbsp;
focus on the material issues but there could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.520
be thousands of factors that were looked at&nbsp;
and considered that then are collapsible um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.920
yet investigators will have their own theory of&nbsp;
the case when they're investigating a case and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.800
they wouldn't necessarily want to stop with just&nbsp;
the most material factors and they might have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:23.080
series of questions they they might want to say&nbsp;
things like did you look at the percentage of cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.920
transactions that this customer is doing and be&nbsp;
able to get an answer on what the percentage was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.440
is this unusually high for this customer or is&nbsp;
it consistent with their activity over the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.960
few years is this unusually high for my entire&nbsp;
customer base is this unusually high for other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:46.680
entities like this I mean what's unusual for a&nbsp;
pizza shop uh in Boston is not what's unusual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:55.120
for a multinational manufacturing concern uh in&nbsp;
in in that's headquartered in California so this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:01.240
kind of Distinction and this kind of Co analysis&nbsp;
is something that a Savvy investigator looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.400
and just having someone who's got all the answers&nbsp;
who's looked at all the factors but you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.720
your own judgment on whether you want to consider&nbsp;
those factors as even if they're not red flags as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:20.040
part of building uh you know a case to either um&nbsp;
confirm or or you know or or satisfy your concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:26.600
a lot of that sounds like classical AI although&nbsp;
I guess if you have a a generative AI interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:35.080
it's easier to query the system certainly easier&nbsp;
to create a u you know more readable and succinct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.920
uh narrative that is giving you the synopsis of&nbsp;
all these different factors and it's a lot easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.720
to navigate when you're able to ask questions and&nbsp;
get answers instead of having to weed through and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.280
you know do search which can be you know a&nbsp;
kind of crude tool for trying to find these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.640
factors you guys have been around for a while&nbsp;
uh but the the the tech is evolving very quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:05.800
uh is that difficult for you to keep up with with&nbsp;
what's happening I guess that's your job right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.600
specifically yeah it is it's it is difficult to&nbsp;
keep up with it but it's also exciting and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.600
the opportunity yeah because if it was easy&nbsp;
everybody be doing it do you have a sales job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:24.440
to do yourself internally uh to say look uh we&nbsp;
we should be using this uh you know and and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:34.160
I would imagine there's a lot of risk involved&nbsp;
reputational risk if you implement some tool or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:42.840
methodology uh that that you know these Financial&nbsp;
Services firms are relying on well I mean number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:48.960
one the the financial services firms themselves&nbsp;
are all asking these questions and hoping for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.600
Solutions in this realm and just looking for&nbsp;
guidance on how to do it safely so that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.400
where a lot of our energy goes into is making it&nbsp;
safe making it governable making repeatable un&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.720
explainable um and they keep us honest because&nbsp;
nobody just takes our Solutions and puts them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:10.720
straight into production they go through rigorous&nbsp;
you know uat user acceptance testing processes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:17.560
um they gather statistics on the decisions it&nbsp;
makes they actually co-pilot um decisions with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:24.760
actual human users for a period of time socialize&nbsp;
that it works well have people you know Sound the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.920
Alarm if they see something that looks off right&nbsp;
and um you know they continue to do this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:36.000
review even after it goes live they they take&nbsp;
you know different subsets of of the cases and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.960
they investigate some of them in by hand more&nbsp;
intensively to double check the machine um you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.720
know lower risk ones maybe less so and they do&nbsp;
this over time so that they can you know respond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.080
to the evolving threat environment but also make&nbsp;
sure that it's not going off track at any point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.560
along the way they they use the statistics that&nbsp;
they get through these types of um testing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:07.000
co-piloting procedures to you know build their&nbsp;
model risk management reports which is um very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.880
burdensome but also helps keep everything safe&nbsp;
right by you know exhaustively testing comparing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:21.680
results looking for any signs of error explaining&nbsp;
how it works and so on is this um a crowded market&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:29.720
for you guys or or are there just a handful of&nbsp;
players so there's some players that are more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:36.440
a Consulting shop that get involved and they start&nbsp;
from scratch in your environment and train only on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:43.320
your data and you know our proposition is that we&nbsp;
show up ready to work and that's highly valued by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:50.720
people also a lot of the other companies that are&nbsp;
do business in this space tend to um be one-trick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:56.600
ponies and you know banks in particular like to&nbsp;
deal with strategic vendors that can help them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.000
with the whole portfolio of problems and not just&nbsp;
one problem and that works to our advantage is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:12.040
your customer base primarily a us uh institutions&nbsp;
and and do the com compliance issues I would guess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.760
that they're they're different depending on&nbsp;
what Market you're working in so we do have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:24.760
a slight um you know slightly higher number&nbsp;
of us-based Institutions than International&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:31.080
but we have significant presence in Europe and a&nbsp;
growing presence in the Middle East in particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:39.680
um most of our customers are Global in scope so&nbsp;
you know even if they are headquartered in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:46.200
US they have divisions around the world so as a&nbsp;
result they're all all subject to you know this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.920
multi-jurisdictional regulatory regime so when we&nbsp;
work with these large companies that it helps us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.200
when we're working with a smaller company that's&nbsp;
in a more limited set of jurisdictions because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:02.720
we've already got it cover yeah on the sanctions&nbsp;
of tracking sanction companies are there many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:10.480
examples of financialist Institutions that end&nbsp;
up getting fined heavily because they didn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:19.880
their customer or or you know ended up processing&nbsp;
a transaction uh that unbeknownst to them was with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:27.440
a sanctioned entity yeah uh failing to enforce&nbsp;
sanctions results in big fines but what results&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:33.680
and even larger fines is having material&nbsp;
weaknesses in your um enforcement regime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:40.520
right so you know if you're not doing something&nbsp;
that's considered a best practice um then you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.000
going to be in a lot worse trouble uh than if you&nbsp;
were doing everything you could and someone made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.200
a mistake it's after all still a human business&nbsp;
uh at the end of the day um we also see you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:53.200 --> 00:41:00.280
the reputational risk is pretty big right being&nbsp;
associated with money laundering or you know drug&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:05.560
trafficking or you know Terror financing is&nbsp;
not something anybody wants to see their name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.640
and prints around uh so there's these kind of&nbsp;
non-financial hits that are also quite so good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:18.680
thing I think the last thing is people in trying&nbsp;
to you know respond to margin pressure um you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:25.880
without automation they wind up trying to drive&nbsp;
investigators to do casework far too fast to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:33.200
responsible so we've had people that we've helped&nbsp;
that before we arrived we're trying to process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:39.320
hundreds or even a thousand cases a day and if you&nbsp;
just do the math on that I mean per investigator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.560
you just do the math on things like that even if&nbsp;
you're just looking at a particular transaction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:50.200
to see if it's a sanction entity you can hardly&nbsp;
watch a screen paint and click no that fast you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.640
right so Regulators pay attention to that as well&nbsp;
and so one of the things that we're doing is we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:02.800
eliminating all these you know noise hits so that&nbsp;
people can have the time to focus on doing a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:11.560
job on the investigations that are risk yeah is&nbsp;
there a periodic auditing by Regulators or is it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:20.240
when something slips through and and there's a&nbsp;
fine that The Regulators then go back and look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:27.120
at the proceeds processes and decide whether or&nbsp;
not the the bank was was doing things correctly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.400
it's it's annual reviews that get done um&nbsp;
and they also uh you know there's different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:39.080
government entities that do the Audits and they&nbsp;
rotate the different audit teams in into customers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.840
so that they don't get too cozy and so that they&nbsp;
don't deepen the ruts right of the invest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.080
audits so this really provides you know excellent&nbsp;
compliance checking on the part of our Regulators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:50.080 --> 00:43:00.840
is your sense that with the increasing power and&nbsp;
pervasiveness of AI not only generative AI the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:08.920
financial system is is getting buttoned up so that&nbsp;
it's increasingly difficult to perpetrate fraud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:15.240
or to for a sanction to entity to to operate&nbsp;
in in the mainstream Financial system it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:20.360
increasingly difficult and that's great news&nbsp;
for all of us right because these sanctions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:27.600
and um anti-money laundering Etc are in place to&nbsp;
catch a wide variety of deep ills in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.880
but the thing that it's not all good news um&nbsp;
it's a double-edged sword these Technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:39.040
and these Technologies can also be used to help&nbsp;
cover tracks um so it's an arms race you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:45.520
stay really on top of it to stay one step ahead&nbsp;
of you know those who wish us ill and and do do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:51.720
you track crypto transactions is that in your&nbsp;
