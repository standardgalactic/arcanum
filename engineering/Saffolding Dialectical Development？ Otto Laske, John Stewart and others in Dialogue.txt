so good morning good evening how wonderful to see you all here we're having another wonderful
um discussion dialogue with otto laske and john stewart uh you remember we had two parts before
so there was one salon with john stewart another with otto laske and now today we are coming to a
dialogue together the question of the series as you all know is around the question of scaffolding
the electrical metasystemic development and the title already is it a good metaphor to scaffold
the title already is being part of the dialogue i think so it's not only um how to do this etc but
already is it a legitimate metaphor to scaffold or is there something else that would be more
appropriate to use as a metaphor to approach this topic i was requesting otto and john not to give
another presentation at the beginning and have a short dialogue at the end but rather maybe we could
start a dialectical dialogue here in the room together and maybe you john and you otto could
ask each other questions um so that we can deepen our understanding together so this is a um something
that we cannot prepare right and this is i think exactly what we are looking for a dialectical firework
of ideas together so otto do you want to start
yeah yes i would like to say that for me there is a big difference between teaching dialectical thinking
or mentoring it and talking about teaching um because as soon as we get to about we are getting into
interpretations and scaffolding is one is an interpretive term um so there is a risk in talking about
um interpretation of what john and i are doing rather than speaking about what we are actually doing
for instance i mentor dialectical thinking very differently depending on whether the learner
um the learner um the learner's native language is english or spanish or japanese or german
um so i was just sent out this warning that we are getting into ideology
and interpretation rather than what actually happens in teaching
and that's important to me so i would be delighted to answer questions and also ask questions and um
since john has put forward the metaphor of scaffolding if i
i am supposed to begin asking a question i will ask you john what are you scaffolding when you are scaffolding
okay well i'll i'll start by talking about self scaffolding um self scaffolding of cognition
or self scaffolding of cognitive development um so i've been self scaffolding for over 50 years
and i got into that by accident my by my predispositions um not because of any you know great
intelligence or insight or whatever uh so i was about i was in year 11 at school
and did very badly on a physics test and prior to that i'd done very well in all maths and science
um and it occurred to me mainly because of books i've read one called psycho cybernetics which was big in
the 60s um and also books by gurdjieff that that i needed to uh work out uh or understand how to solve
problems um so i had to develop a meta understanding uh of how to approach physics problems in order to
solve them so i started off by interviewing the top students in the class and asking them you know how
does your mind work when you you um address the physics problem how do you get it how have you
been so successful how you've got it right i want to appropriate their their what now i might call
movements in thought um they're so so that i could do it in myself um what i found was that they weren't
aware they weren't they didn't have a meta perspective of their problem solving capacities
um i was very disappointed at that so i realized that i had to look inside myself um and watch how
my mind worked and see how my mind could be improved uh at solving physics problems um at first when i looked
um i saw very little uh the the and i had to keep looking uh in order to see what as i said might be
called movements in thought and so on and then i had to see how they worked i had to see where they
failed and where they failed um when i found a physics problem i couldn't work out i had to
intentionally modify my thought processes so that now i would be able to solve that problem so that's
that's sort of self scaffolding that's what i mean by self self scaffolding and by recursive
self-improvement the recursive self-improvement is that it's an ongoing process utterly open-ended
uh probably never never ends um and the and as you do it too that's important i think to mention the
phases as i do it when i first looked it was very hard to see anything then i started seeing my thought
processes i could play with them modify them see the consequences of that then they became automatic
um they come up to consciousness and they go down they become automatic and and like any procedural skill
um that's over learned so to speak um they become they become automatic no longer conscious they're
fluid and they can be operated quickly so that self scaffolding was basically at the analytical
rational level it was it wasn't you know at the metasystemic level um and as a result of that i
found you know physics maths and everything very easy i went from the middle of the class to the top
of the class and then then i was fourth in the the state in the public year 12 exam examinations
and critically importantly for me it was easy uh yeah it didn't require much work in science and
mathematics to do that so in any event um i went i moved from there uh i had always been interested in
complex phenomenon and i uh i had work and i had science science challenges in developing a big picture
theory of evolution that demanded the understanding of complex phenomenon so that moved me into the
self scaffolding oh and recursive improvement of my uh models of complex reality then in about 2009
uh sorry i just should mention that that gave me intuitive capacities um i didn't have a comprehensive
scaffolding system at that time i didn't i had good intuitive capacities and so on so in 2009 i came
across a review of otto's um hidden dimensions book volume two that that included uh amazingly for me um
a manual of dialectical thinking uh that sort of hit me like a brick particularly when i saw what he
what he had um done and how comprehensive that was what it was was to me a fully formed
comprehensive framework that identified the movements in thought uh that would enable one uh enable one to
use a scaffolding to uh improve and further recursively improve one's one's ability to develop complex
models of complex phenomenon uh so it that that was what i had done originally for analytical rational
cognition and problem solving uh now i had a comprehensive framework um that could work for uh
metasystemic thinking and by metasystemic thinking i just mean the ability to develop mental models of
complex reality and complex phenomenon i i mean it that broadly and as i said this development is an
open-ended process so when i saw that i i saw that there was that uh i'd been thinking of there's very
little complexity thinking in the world in science and evolutionary theory and so on very few people
have that capacity i saw that the the thought form framework gave a tool to intentionally uh scaffold
self scaffolding in others uh and i uh co-organized a meeting which was the first planning meeting for
the second enlightenment because it was based on the the belief that the scaffolding of metasystemic
cognition would produce a new kind of science uh new kinds of humanities uh and would lead to a second
enlightenment uh where the limitations of analytical rational cognition which is mechanistic thinking
that only works for limited parts of reality that can be approximated by mechanistic models uh would be
that those limitations would be overcome by this metasystemic cognition
um so anyway i hope that that gives you some indication of what sort of what's going on in my
head uh and then i use words to try and describe that and of course the words are pointers um when
you're trying to describe what's going in your head it's particularly difficult to um uh communicate
with another individual about it because they're not inside your head uh the words you use as pointers
uh you know uh and if they haven't shared the experiences then you can't do what witgenstein
talked about as a language game it's very hard to develop common language for common experiences
um but that gives you a more fulsome sort of account hopefully uh of what goes on in my head what i
mean by scaffolding uh why i think it can be enhanced and i think i should probably just add one additional
thing and that is that vertical development is extremely difficult um the when i came back from
the first planet at the first planet made into the second enlightenment i work with uh victoria wilding
um to develop a program for uh scaffolding uh metasystemic thinking and in in that uh a key concern
was that for an individual to be able to uh develop a capacity for self-scaffolding they had to be able
to see their thinking as object uh they in addition they had to be they had they had to be
escaped slavery to analytical rational cognition and they had to move vertically they had to move
vertically so that what previously was part of the subject becomes object in keegan's sort of metaphor
and therefore the first half of the program was designed to use meditation like techniques
to uh enable that vertical development enable the disembedding about enable the the instruction
of a new subject that could then use the thought forms seeing the use as object in one's own head
seeing the analytical rational cognition and its limitations and so on so i'll stop there i've
gone on long enough i'm sure yeah thank you john it's good to know about how you
came to
asking questions about the structure of your own thinking and what is complex cognition and so forth
uh as you said in the beginning at the beginning what we say about dialectical thinking and teaching it
is filled with assumptions that we are making about the nature of mind and so it's indeed very difficult
to talk so i would to talk about uh what we have chosen as a topic um maybe i could um following your
example somewhat uh but maybe a little shorter uh speak about how i came to what i call dialectical
thinking by the way i would like to clarify that in dtf there is a difference between dialectical and
metasystemic thinking because only when we use transformational thought forms is dialectical thinking
metasystemic in context process relationship we are not dealing with metasystemic issues but with
metasystemic issues that's why i prefer the term dialectical thinking because most people
never get to metasystemic thinking they never get to using transformational thought forms but that's just
nomenclature um so in response to you um john i would like to share that i think i learned um
what we call dialectical thinking here or metasystemic thinking as you do um had to do with
following the text analysis made by two
very deep minds working in real time together in a seminar at frankfurt university
uh horkheimer and adorno would put would invite people into a haupt seminar or main seminar in which we
would read hegel and i did that for about eight years and if i think about what that meant uh today i would
see i would say i would say this that we were provoked to think about not just hegel but how he moved
from one thought to another and as we did that over two hours every week for eight years of course we were
waking up after one or two years it's a long journey to the structure of our own thinking
and um even then um when i when i left the haupt seminar
of course i made the mistake to think that i had the world in my pocket i was a complex thinker
nothing could um you know hinder me from doing what i wanted to do um a big mistake
but anyway i would think what it means to me today is to have been challenged to think about my own
movements in thought as a second step away from thinking about hegel's movements in thought as
interpreted by adorno and horkheimer in a dialogue they would dialogue they they would which meant they
would um discuss what is the most appropriate interpretation of a movement in thought in hegel
from one sentence to another and so for me that kind of thinking became something very personal early on
and um and um in the sense that i thought um of course i think i think everybody thinks that that nobody thinks like you
you know that and you are you are unique and you're thinking and indeed you are um
um but since you are thinking in concepts and most people neither realize that they are thinking
know that they are thinking in concepts know that they are constantly engaged in internal conversations
and that's the main difficulty in mentoring people they are not aware of of being
uh of thinking um well i lost the thought i was going after so maybe i could say this for me today um thought forms and
are ways of first of all making people aware that they are thinking in real time unceasingly
and i think that awareness is a precondition for them to begin to be interested in thought forms
because once they have an inkling of their own thinking which arises from dialogue with others
they can then having asked what is the other what is the thought form structure of my partner
begin to think of what is the thought form structure of myself as i am in dialogue with somebody with the other
so obviously for me at least dialectic and dialogue are so are almost identical because the dialogue
dialogue that occurs in us um is is i should say i'm thinking of hannah arend's wonderful description of the mind
as being a an unceasing putting oneself into in question uh the mind she says
uh at incredible speeds uh it's the same mind that asks itself questions and answers them
in an incredible speed makes it difficult without thought forms i think
thought forms i think to realize what is going on um and so for me thought forms have become
the most important function i see in thought forms is that they are mind openers and their mind openers in a double sense
they are opening my mind about the thought form the thought flow in another person
and in myself so every thought form is the origin of very very many different questions you can ask
you know if we take thought form one unceasing motion um there's an endless number of questions you can ask somebody
about unceasing motion and you can ask yourself so that is one function of the mind opener
of the mind opening that you can ask questions formulate questions the other one is that you can listen in a
at a level of depth to others once you master the thought forms as to what is going on in others mind
and so these two functions both of the mind opening functions one practiced in listening and one practiced in asking questions
is what i try to bring to life in my teaching um and so listening to each other or listening by reading a text
a text for me in my teaching is as important as being able to ask questions from others and oneself
the the two uh processes really dovetail the listening and the asking um i think i will stop here i've tried to
point out not as briefly as i hoped i could um how the germ was so to speak put into me to begin questioning
my own movements and thought and their structure but uh at that time uh of the frankfurt school i didn't
have any tools uh to analytically investigate um and um it was only through becoming involved with
passages and bascar especially passages i should i should just say as to the manual you were finding so
important ron the manual is a total survivor it was begun to be written in 1978 by a student of
passages called michael bob and michael bob wrote a dissertation that was the ur manual the first version of
the manual which got never published which never got published um i took over bob's manual or ur urschrift
in 1999 and made and expanded it um and that became the manual you are now seeing
so it took from 1978 to 2008 for that manual to take its final form and it could have gone lost it could
have you know if i hadn't picked it up it would have gotten lost so that's 30 years um well anyway that's a
point uh historical point um perhaps bernhard you can help us find a commonality or common ground
or anybody else in the audience between what john has said and what i have said
well yeah john uh yeah the what i think is a common ground that um points to the central issue in
scaffolding for me is that you said you said that a significant um event process in your
the seminars of adorno and so on was that it opened you up to your own thinking so that and that began
then you working on your own thinking that that enabled you to uh to an extent i don't know to what
extent exactly but to self-scaffold to examine your own thinking to see limitations and presumably you
use the you're being able to see hegel's thinking as object to an extent uh you know to improve to
apply that to your own thinking where where it was lesser than hegel so to speak so and then you
mention further that um that in you know your subsequent experience yes it's that becoming
aware of your own thinking that that's critical um and to use thought forms in that process and the
thought forms uh you enable you to catch hold of these high speed yeah that are going on and so on
which is what what i say when i first you know stumbled onto something like this in year 11 at school i
looked inside and yeah there was nothing there i interviewed other people yeah there was nothing
to catch hold of but but with persistence in any event that that seems to me that's the you know to me
uh that is and was the key issue how do you open people up to their own thinking and yeah and that's
where you know what i've called the disembedding process which which i don't think you'd like i've got
the feeling but it can be described in many different ways but in essence that is the purpose
of the you know the first half of this program that victoria wildin and i worked on it is to achieve
it's to open people up to their own uh thinking and feeling basically to see it as object so you know
the the keegan sorry please don't worry whether i like it or not it's not important no but i i throw
it in there yeah just because i don't if you don't like stuff then i'm quite happy no it's not about
liking it it's about i think for me it would be about the assumptions made if we use terms like
disembedding and scaffolding but we don't have time for that here right yeah right okay okay so
so but yeah feel feel free to you know be critical because the it it's that's part of
the beneficial process of this dialogue so um but in any event this key issue you know what technology
what psychotechnology exists for achieving in a short period of time not eight or nine years
this opening oneself up to one's own thinking being able to see it as object and so on yes
perhaps i can tell an anecdote from my japanese cohort that i'm teaching right now so there we work in a
second language and whatever we do or the materials i use in that class i ask the members of the cohort to
translate into japanese and to work in their native language it's a very interesting process because a lot of
translation is going on on their side unfortunately i don't know any japanese it it's it's really
a highly a highly interesting process that one could probably write a book about um i want to just um
tell this story that what happened um initially these people as all the students i've taught were not aware of
of their own internal conversations uh and that is for me the greatest difficulty in starting
and in that sense there is nothing to disembed except to disembed them from their not knowing that they are
constantly uh and unceasingly uh involved in their own thinking so that i i i indeed try to disembed
them from and um for two for for four weeks i didn't think that i made any impression on these japanese minds
in terms of what dialectical thinking is it is only um i think the japanese are very dutiful students
they adhere to protocol and of course they did that with my materials too uh and so they were worried
whether they had the right thought form and the correct thought form until i told them
um the thought form really doesn't matter you just need to begin somewhere with some thought form and
then if i asked you to justify why you think this thought form shows up in this interview text
if you have once you have to justify it even then the thought form doesn't matter what matters is that you
begin thinking in your own personal way of what the thought form means for you
and uh actually i told them any thought form you choose uh in analyzing a text or in listening to
an interview is only kind of a launching pad for going to other thought forms so that you begin
seeing that in your own mind not on paper but in your own mind the thought forms are all related
they they they are part of a network they are not uh separable into different buckets
as classes of thought form it's it's a terrible term class of such ones so it's only once the students
the japanese the japanese my japanese students began to be um liberated by me by saying forget about that
thought from your beginning with just go from there and see what happens in your mind that they felt
personally empowered to engage with thought forms i think that was the turning point and it happened i think
in session five so right well i think we're yeah that's that's something that we're completely aligned
on as well and that is you know i describe it in different terms i describe it as yeah yeah the
translation from declarative knowledge to procedural knowledge so the the thought form is is in declarative
knowledge and but the object is not to insert that declarative knowledge into your head as a declarative
statement the object is to turn it into a skill to you know something in motion something in in your in
your thinking uh which which is you know i use the example of learning a serve how to serve in tennis
or ride a bicycle um declarative knowledge about how to serve you know in a written page uh
one one instill your body with the procedural knowledge needed to actually implement the serve
so the so that again brings us back to the question i mean how do you uh promote that that
which i i'd say is part of soft scaffolding that is using thought forms translating them into your mental
processes and exercise uh exercising those so so really what what you sort of hit on there is
you know is a teaching method you know that that uh help them make that transition and and the question
is that that teaching method seems to me would be yes critical and needs to be in any uh psychotechnology for
scaffolding you know higher cognition then that needs to be a an intentional clear
uh part of the process the teaching training process but i i wanted to just come back to the
this issue of disembedding because i see now um a bit how i've misled you with you know that term so
uh because the and you say well you can use it as disembedding from uh the notion that they can see
their own thinking that they're not aware of it and that's a precondition to get them to see their
own thinking so i i use it in the term of keegan's model um of vertical development so the because
he we are talking about vertical development here it's no simple thing to move from analytical cognition
it's so how do you so his model of vertical development and he doesn't have a mechanism for
it he doesn't have a it all is what i've looked at he doesn't have a psycho technology for it um the
the keegan's model is simply that vertical development consists of um the that what is part of the subject
at one level and that therefore you are not aware of becomes object to a new subject at the higher level
and the and where that's relevant to vertical cognitive development just as it's it's um relevant
to vertical social emotional development is that you need if if you were to you know train that
train that shift you would need a psycho technology so to speak uh that um created a new higher level
subject to which the previous level was object and yeah that's the opening up to one's own thinking
that that i talk about and that's where i use the term you know the word disembedding but it's not a
technical term or anything else so yeah that's what i'm getting that's what i'm pointing to yeah it
strikes me john that this process by which people become aware of their own internal workplace and
internal process happens in two different forms that are of course related one is social emotional
the other is cognitive um because uh in the sense that as you mature social emotionally in your meaning
making you are increasingly becoming aware of the structure of your own meaning making process
which is no different from what happens in the cognitive domain and so the structure of both processes
is is is is very similar in addition i would think that what is going on in social emotional
development is already cognitive except that the social structure of this increasing
uh depth of meaning uh depth of meaning making is not is something the person is not aware of
so there is an intrinsic relationship between the two ways of
disembedding if you want you know um and i think that's important for understanding
um vertical development yeah yeah i i think i think john then you and i agree on one thing and please
correct me if that's not so in your mind that initially thought forms are a kind of foreign object
that one has to make one's own in order to see the reason for using them or the the benefit they
bestow on you as you use them they are foreign objects in the sense that they are just concepts as
any other concept they're high level concepts um which can be articulated by very many different
concepts for instance uh salt form one unceasing emotion is a concept but in my sense it's a high
level concept because you can render it in many many different ways you can articulate in many many
different ways now so initially it is an object that one has that the learner has to make his own
so to go back to this japanese story when people finally understood that they could just run with any
thought form um i told them your mind is a galaxy and you can go from one star in that galaxy to another
and it's no different in the network of dialectical thought forms they're they are they form a network
they form a galaxy galaxy so you can jump from one sort from to the other and and you do it in your
very personal way depending on your level of vertical development your psychic system and your life history
and so forth yeah so i i agree that yes we're totally on the same uh track there that um the it's
about uh that i loved your metaphor that the thought forms are a foreign object if they're foreign to the
skill part of the mind um they're they fit into they fit into the to the declarative part of the mind so you can
ask an exam on all the thought forms and and so on but they're foreign objects in relation to the skill
part and the question is how you move how you how you do that and that's why central to the scaffolding
process that um that that i uh have designed is the uh the um that the that it centrally involves the
practice of of building complex mental models so it's all about practicing implementing moving from the
thought forms as foreign objects to skills that are part of a meta model a skill meta model that
is then applied to develop and understandings of complex phenomenon you know for particular purposes
i i have to say i don't like the term skills for me dialectic i think it's not a skill set
it's more of a personal stance in encountering the world
so what happens in for me what happens in developing thought form understanding is a change of the
personal stance towards the world because the world is beginning to show up differently for the person
using thought forms than it did before the person feels liberated to follow their own thoughts
once they engage with thought forms and as a result of that this is my hypothesis
the world beginning with the social world shows up very differently
um that means you listen to those around you who speak to you differently
that's of course also the case when you learn
about stages of social emotional development you begin to ask yourself is my boss talking to me from level
level three or level four is this three slash four or is it four bracket three you know that's what i teach in social emotional
cohorts so it's very similar socially emotionally and cognitive yeah and for me to just wrap this up
for me the the important thing is
that i can bring people to a point where they realize that the world will show up according to
how they think about it that how the world shows up for them is entirely in their hands so to speak
well that's that's uh was behind the the notion that i outlined that the emergence and spread of
metasystemic thinking throughout uh humanity will lead to a second enlightenment it'll entail a new
science people will do the world differently they'll see different phenomena and so on
then then someone at say the analytical rational level just coming back to this critical issue of um
moving vertically you raise the issue of your social emotional as well as cognitive development
and pointed out that in both those uh vertical moves it's necessary for the individual uh
to what i would say disembed from the the previous level and see it as object so seeing it as object is
the you know the keegan notion and the social emotionally um you know in the first half of
the program that victoria wilding and i developed um it involves you know meditation like practices that
engage that that involve practicing disengaging from feelings and emotions and being able to see them
as object it's not suppressing them or anything they're still they're actually seen and understood
more clearly and their their importance is able to be uh seen more clearly and taken advantage of but
that transition where uh they are now seen as object leads to what keegan described very aptly as moving
from a state in which emotions have you to one in which you have emotions now cognitively it's also very
apt it's also very apt because the and this is you know the to me the reason why a psycho technology
is needed to uh to to scaffold vertical development in relation to cognition um because the the individual
needs to move from a circumstance in which analytical rational thinking has them
to to being a person who has analytical rational for cognition and can use it as a tool and and
and embedded in a wider framework and so on of um metasystemic thinking so the that's that's so i
emphasize again that keegan was very good at aptly describing this vertical process in my view but
he didn't have a technology for actually achieving and that's what i that's a major interest to me
because it's the key leverage yes and so he was in my view keegan was actually trying to reduce
development uh cognitive development to social emotional development which is absurd um yeah yeah so um where are we um
um i think we agree john that what we are doing when we help people make thought forms their own
their own is we are changing the frame of reference uh from which they construct the world both social
emotionally and cognitively i think so i would always yeah i would always link the two ways of
of disembedding as you say yeah what have we not talked about and should have talked about
what's what's absent what has remained absent just nominate a thought form we haven't covered
you know that's an important point for me that i think what i was able to do
is to put dialectic back on a platonic level because in plato the late plato
timeos and so forth dialectic is not used to construct the world
uh it is a point uh i mean plato the late plato points to the fact that everything has has its other
uh every thought has its other everything has its its other and it is this other this negativity that
pervades everything and then the history of philosophy if i look at it following you nick
is an attempt to use dialectic ontologically to construct the world and to interpret just about anything
and so dialectic moved away from the marketplace where it was really used by socrates he he used it to
question people uh regarding the use of they made of a certain concept like love or the good and so
forth so he um elicited from them how they thought about the good and then critiqued them or at least put
doubts in their head about the way they did that so he was a listener at the same time he was a challenger
and i think for me that is the core of dialectic not the philosophical ideologies that have been built
around it i think that's what you were pointing out right
i think we are speaking from a point of view of human exceptionalism when we think that thinking
uh people's uh people's changing people's thinking will save the world uh and and that's a risky
position to have uh yeah i in my last lecture i distinguish between a psychic system and the
reflexive system meaning by the letter the link between uh social emotional and cognitive and so
um you know we can um we we should entertain some doubts um regarding our assumption that thinking
will save us uh but to the extent that we i mean maybe it's the amoeba that doesn't think that will
survive and humanity will not survive right so um we know that logical thinking will not make us survive
but we are not sure whether dialectical or metasystemic thinking will let us survive either or as
lawrence wallersheim would say at least half of humanity
by 2050 to be concrete so yes what research program
nick do you mean research program beyond
the one that we know about and have been part of
geared to understanding cognitive development
what research program do you actually mean
i fully agree that that is needed that instead of um yes indeed
we need controlled experiments of the effect of different ways of mentoring
dialectical thinking following a very narrow protocol of using dtf i think
because if we well i should be much more specific about it but you know the three houses is a very
narrow protocol and it's meant to keep an anecdotal data out of the interview not to make interviewing
simple but to keep anecdotal subject matter out of the interview and i think something like that
something like an economic constraining device in those experiments is needed to compare different
teaching methods and their result on people over a year over two years and so forth i fully agree
at this point universities don't even teach dialectical thinking and so it's kind of
kind of bizarre to think that they would undertake experimental programs in dialectical thinking but maybe
that's the way to go i don't know
you know i mean i have made experiments in different teaching methods regarding dialectical thinking for over
20 years now but they have remained personal they have not been explicit the assessments i've made are not
you know are not have not become subjects of research but yeah i couldn't agree more
if we want to think analytically in logical terms then we might as well also think of
how to measure the effectiveness of different ways of teaching dialectical thinking or thought forms
yeah one path to that um that will happen fairly naturally i think is that a diversity of approaches
will be spawned yeah scaffolding dialectical thinking and that's what i see part of this series of salons
is about you know i mean hopefully it has ripple effects uh where it inspires people to go and develop
their own schemes and and enter the marketplace and and offer them uh you know to make a living out of
and so on and then then academia can come in and it'll have three or four different uh methods that
have grown up naturally and it can compare them and have a control group and so on so i'd say that's
where it goes the the great problem in in academia is is is that any hierarchical ranking system
um yeah that ranks people in cognitive levels tends to be offensive to you know post-modernist
uh sensibilities so that's sort of that that's retarded development in you know in adult development
in general uh despite the fact of its enormous importance just on the issue of the other your first
question which was about the importance of of metasystemic dialectical thinking uh yeah i come from
a science background um which is yeah it's probably come from a left brain dominant perspective rather than
right brain and the and i saw in science particularly in evolutionary theory which is
um what my great interest has been in uh i saw that you know analytical rational science uh or even to
an extent if you look at behaviorism concrete operations science um held sway and it's ineffective
at understanding complex phenomenon and and to a large extent gives gives rise to the difference between
science and the humanities so uh so i've always had my mind since i started scaffolding soft scaffolding
at a young age um i've always had in mind the goal of expanding science with a higher level of cognition
that can adequately model complex phenomenon because existing science can't and it seems to me that you
you know the great problems that that confront the world today um including the variations on the
tragedy of the commons which drives our economic systems to in turn drive uh you know the destruction
of the planet and possible ending of civilization um that those problems are a highly complex phenomenon
can't be understood without metasystemic cognition and strategies for dealing with them can't be
understood without metasystemic cognition so i do see it as as absolutely central to the evolutionary and
human project you know on this planet um that's a good belief system to have
yeah it could but it is a belief system yeah yeah i understand
yeah
since i'm the culprit you know in pushing scaffolding and and so on yeah i mean i use
very analytical rational language in describing you know what what we're talking about here
and basically i do because that's that's the level that you know the majority of people are at in the
world and if you want to communicate with them you you have to do it to a certain extent additionally
it's very hard to actually translate mental models of complex phenomenon into linear language um you
i've always found that uh where i recognize a a um metasystemic thinking and read their books
then i can't get their models from you know the the words on the page i have to put the book aside
when i when i read um for example otto's hidden dimensions book it took me probably months to get
through it because i'd read a paragraph and then reflect on it and so on and have that space you
know that you're talking about because you because i have to build my own models from the linear writing
uh and what a what a complexity thinker does is is they they have their complex model they convert
parts of it into something that they can write on paper that's acceptable say to science um and the
they don't write the model on the on the page and for you to get their model you have to do a creative
effort um on on this issue of you know space and not scaffolding it's an engineering kind of term and
and so on uh again i'd come back to what i see as the necessity of um
um you know a meditative kind of process because metasystemic cognition to me uh must is basically
the marriage of the the bride and the groom the right brain and the left brain the male and the
female and you know and so on so it is it has to to to able to apply the thought forms in a way that
is not analytic just analytical rational um you need to access the pattern recognition facilities of
the brain intuitive capacities and so on and that essentially means you know in a again in a mechanistic
description switching off the left brain thinking or you know the incessant analytical rational thinking
or disembedding from it or whatever language you know yes what are you and the uh so um sorry i just
lost my train of thought with it i think pointing to the what so-called right hemisphere if we've yeah
if if if we follow for instance mcgilchrist yeah so that's that's what i was going to just finish
up for me also a very important uh notion of what dialectical thinking is able to do
that as he as mcgilchrist points out the left hemisphere is in a very different mood or relationship
to the world than the left hemisphere in that it is empathic holistic um and and and uh and systemic
in some sense although not in the linguistic sense of the left hemisphere and as as adorno always said
concepts um um are unable in the end to render the richness of what they are describing
let's take the the term the term dahlia dahlia is a flower and this flower is very different whether
we look at it as something we want to sell or something we want to grow or something we want to
cut or something we want to study it is never the same dahlia and i think dialectical thinking in terms
of thought forms allows us to look at an object like dahlia from all these different points of view
and so in that sense we we can using thought forms demolish a concept like dahlia showing that it has
so many different perspectives or dimensions and we can go into all of them so we are opening up we are not
just opening up the mind we are opening up the object world uh what we see it seems to me and that's what
i also implied when i spoke of a dialectical thinker adopting a different stance towards the world
so just just coming back to the that uh because i agree i'm completely completely with what you're saying
again i'm always looking for a i'll call it a psycho technology rather than a scaffolding strategy but
but again analytical rational terms but but the issue is what gives us access to the right brain because
that's the other the mcgilchrist like keegan uh doesn't have a um a method for accessing my brain so
we need to integrate right and left brain to do metasystemic thinking uh and for lots of other you
know useful purposes what's the technology for achieving that uh that's why i use the term disembedding
from am i pointing to my number disembedding from our my left brain uh is the technology for achieving
that are appropriately structured meditative practices because they switch off the left brain
that's experienced as peace and silence and out of that silence out of that space uh you know comes the
the essential uh capacities needed um from the right brain for metasystemic thinking and so on
i think also that children have an intuitive understanding of the wholeness
uh of of of the world and we are driving that out of them through schooling them um there's no doubt
about that i mean in a way dialectical thinking i have somewhere described it as an attempt to
construct reconstruct life and thought
and and and and that life is is already with us as children but you know we are moving from earlier
heaven to later heaven to speak in terms of the chinese and although we have a chance to return to
earlier heaven once we have done our job in society not everybody does that takes that journey back
and in that sense i always say i'm not teaching you anything new
you already know dialectical thinking you're just not aware of where it sits in you and how it works in
your mind so it's an awakening an awakening process i'd refer to the you know the wilbur pre-trans fallacy
mistaking you know lower levels of development with high levels of development i would agree completely
that pre-rational pre-analytical rational children adults and so on um they their thinking
will tend to go for example to the the the four quadrants naturally and unrestrictedly and yes
uh so i agree totally with that but that's but that isn't that doesn't give them metasystemic
cognition what metasystemic cognition requires is this process of violence by which that free-flowing mind is
constricted down to analytical rational thinking and then then it is in a position to integrate
to or to use that analytical rational thinking as a platform that is then integrated reintegrated with
the right brain processes in order to produce this higher level capacity which shouldn't be
which is the trans capacity which shouldn't be mistaken with the pre-capacity and what distinguishes it
what it utterly distinguishes it from um say children or pre-rational thinking or indigenous thinking
or whatever is that you know it's enabled it is able to build um rigorous models of complex phenomenon
as they evolve through time and use those for example to understand societies how they're organized and
what sort of interventions in societies can can change the way those societies unfold including by
for example um you know stopping the headlong rush to destruction that's driven by our current
economic system and the way it's arranged you need complex mental models to be able to understand
how our economic system is driving us to destruction even where there are corporations or people within
corporations that have that are well-intentioned and have um you know good outcomes the dynamics of the
system in which they're embedded uh prevent them from doing that and drive destruction
um yeah and that's that's to me the great value of rigorous metasystemic cognition
wonderful um thank you very much to um to otto to john for starting this rich dialogue and thank you to
the other participants for widening it and bringing in your perspectives um this is what i'm hoping for
that we do not just add one thought to the other but that we have a um kind of bringing something
together that together is more complete than the parts um my personal metaphor again and again comes
from gardening so we have and today i was thinking about seeds so if there is no seed we can water and
it and we can put soil to it and there nothing will grow but the moment there is a seed there
something can grow but if the seed doesn't have the right circumstances it won't grow either so the
seed grows by itself i cannot force a seed to grow but i can enable circumstances and maybe the circumstances
listening eight years uh to a perfect dialogue and electric or maybe it's something else that is
the perfect circumstance or maybe it's the space that we are giving people and the listening and the
the warm appreciative atmosphere or if it's just an intriguing improvisation space that is sparking
and unfolding what is already there so that so i'm very grateful for this conversation i thank you
very much it is a journey it is a journey to which we are inviting people yes thank you all thank you
for staying up so late beautiful i'm looking forward to having follow-up conversations we are planning a
salon in december where i will share my my attempts on using artificial intelligence
and now i don't call it as a coach but rather as a sparring partner for dialectical dialogue and we are
looking forward to more events in december and then in january so i'm very grateful to you otto to john
and to the others for enabling this rich field of dialogue thank you goodbye good night good night
