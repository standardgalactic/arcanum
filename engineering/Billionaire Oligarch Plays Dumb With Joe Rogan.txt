all right let's talk about some billionaires here because and this guy's just a hundred
multiple hundred millionaire right joe rogan he's not quite a billionaire yet but he's probably like
at least in the past couple years made a couple hundred million on one deal probably a hundred
million out there i don't know his spotify deal is like 250 million uh and you know but
there's over taxes and you know you got to pay your agent uh so you know you may only have 150
million dollars so his job is to bring on billionaires and have them uh articulate some type
of like grievance one that is about like you know whatever free speech maybe because they're you know
these tech billionaires are so uh enamored with free speech or about how they're being forced to be dei
and the solution is to get the federal trade commission or the consumer financial protection
bureau to stop uh suing them because they're monopolies here is um joe rogan doing his work
as the butler to the billionaires uh sir uh how should we uh deal with your problem with these pesky
little um uh government regulators um forcing you to um uh comport with antitrust laws oh why don't you
come on and complain about how someone swore at you well what was the premise like what what would
they were they're saying was your offense was it that you were allowing information that was not true
that was getting out there i know there was also they're saying that you guys were allowing hate
groups to speak there was a lot of this yeah i mean the the trend the tough thing with politics
is that there's like well when you say who someone's coming after you are you referring to
kind of the government and investigations and all that i mean so the the issue is that there's the
there's what specific thing an agency might be looking into you for and then there's like the
underlying political motivation which is like why do the people who are running this thing hate you
and i think those now pause it for a second i just want to see because like this billionaire baby
brain here and he's understand he knows exactly what he's doing he knows he's talking to somebody who
doesn't really know what they're talking about and he knows that it there that this guy's got the
biggest audience out there and so he's gonna make it about hate you the government hates me
the government hates me i mean like what child would think this this guy's a billionaire this guy has
destroyed companies bought competitors they uh they um they have lied to reporters they have uh you
know they're in the business they they caused a genocide they they like like yeah that's what facebook
that i'm not i'm not being facetious here um look up uh miramar and so this guy knows what he's doing
the government doesn't hate him and he is going to divorce his argument's not going to be like
they hate me because we were putting up we were allowing covet disinformation and we wouldn't take it
down so they hated me like and they wanted they wanted to sit next to jenny at the um at the in the
cafeteria and i wouldn't let him and they thought that jenny was too friends with me and therefore
no that's not what's going on here when biden got in because of of a growing movement within the
democratic party about antitrust and the fact that antitrust laws have not been in any way enforced
since the reagan era that this behemoth facebook meta whatever you want to call it had uh and google for
that matter and apple for that matter these tech behemoths have acquired so much market power they
are breaking antitrust laws they are um uh and they're incidentally not only are they acquiring so
much economic power but they're acquiring so much political power and he doesn't want you to know
that but he doesn't want to know that this is the reason though i'm sorry just like right now meta is
under to you bring up antitrust meta is under in april there will be a if if i don't know the the
trump appointee if they kill this case which is literally what zuckerberg is trying to get happen
to make happen right now with this advertisement on free advertisement by state media joe rogan
meta faces april trial in ftck seeking to unwind instagram merger they acquired instagram in 2012 and then
whatsapp in 2014 the accusation is that they overpaid for them because they wanted to kill a competitor
instagram and tick tock by the way tick tock is instagram's biggest competitor by far and you know
what the supreme court may uphold a tick tock ban which will just inflate this guy's net worth so he
and elon musk are in a race to loot all of us right now uh by killing these actions that would benefit the
general yeah and he leans into the fauci thing because anti-vaxxers are because that's where the
market that's where he's sitting on that's he's on the show that's what i'm saying that's what they
want to hear they're hurt animals that are easily led but again these were the same people that are
talking about save the kids the other day another reason that the fdc is looking at mark zuckerberg's
facebook is because of spying and and profiting off data from kids all right so just remember the
timeline here right uh trump wins uh zuckerberg uh basically announces hey we're gonna allow hate uh
talk on our site uh now we're not going to do any disinformation checking you know all that push
that we had to have actual like journalists do any fact checking we've decided we're not going to do
that anymore and we've hired basically our our global affairs guy is a former bush administration
official who was part of the brooks brothers riot in 2000 long time republican operative and then once
they do all that this guy goes down to florida to visit with the uh the the new monarch um trump
donald trump and i wonder if joe rogan's gonna go like well wait a second what do you say the
government hates you like like in the same way that i hate this guy who you know i bumped into it uh you
know real dick to me in junior high yeah um is this anything to do with the federal trade commission um
antitrust actions against you let's see if he does who wants to put a bet and see if joe rogan's gonna
ask that question i just want to flesh out the timeline that you've just laid out because it's
really important right this the new york times had reporting from over the weekend that they decided
after the election before thanksgiving in those weeks after zuckerberg was consulting with meta board
member billionaire vc mark andresen uh that they were going to wind down all of the hate speech
protections and the fact checking mark andresen went on joe rogan oh my gosh yes i knew i recognized
that name yes he was the one who told us that the consumer financial protection bureau was going after
and debanking people that it was elizabeth warren's personal agency targeting him and other companies
i wonder what it could have been talking he could have been talking about on the 26th of november which is
the exact timeline that the new york times reported on that andresen and zuckerberg were working
together to come up with this new right-wing terms of service and i'm sorry i'm gonna make a really
stupid aesthetic point the freaking broccoli haircut and the oversized t-shirt with the chain dude
you're not a 15 year old tick tocker i i would not be shocked if this guy's getting a divorce because
of this new look that he has going on here oh my god andresen incidentally went on and said that
people are being debanked the consumer financial protection bureau actually has gone after banks
for debanking in this way the complete opposite of what he's saying i remind you also that when peter
thiel's uh mentee um uh jd vance was chosen as president as uh to be the vice president nominee andresen
immediately endorsed donald trump and then elon musk immediately gave uh uh millions of dollars
hundreds of millions of dollars
and then there's like the underlying political motivation which is like why do the people who
are running this thing hate you and i think those can often be two very different things so and we
had organizations that were looking into us that were like not really involved with social media like
i think like the cfpb like this um financial i don't even know what it stands for it's the
the positive this guy you telling me this that mofo doesn't know what the consumer financial
protection bureau stands for are you like how effing dumb is joe rogan how how effing dumb or how much
of an accomplice is he to what these billionaires are doing i mean honestly this is disgusting yeah
what is it the uh the uh listen i'm a businessman al capone doesn't do this this uh fbi what is it
the mark andreessen sure knew what it was federal band incorporated coming after me for my taxes oh he's
above it he's not concerned at all are you 20 21 launched uh investigation by rohi chopra the head
of the cfpb into uh facebook potentially illegally using third-party financial data to target their ads
if he doesn't know about that major government of course he does look you know the name of that
agency head looking into his company then he's just really bad at his job this whole consumer financial
protection bureau thing that he just pulled and go back understand this is the tell that this whole
thing is a performance that this has all been written by his crisis uh um you know his pr firm
this is how you approach joe rogan this is how you go on this is how you dress this is what you say
these are the verbs that you use they hate me says the harvard grad billionaire do the gritty oh my god go
ahead two very different things so and we had organizations that were looking into us that were
like not really involved with social media like i think like the cfpb like this um financial i don't
even know what it stands for it's that it's the financial organization um that elizabeth warren had set
up oh great and and it's basically it's like we're not a bank the deep banking good sector yeah no so
this we're not a bank right it's like marketplace what does meta have to do with this but they kind
of found some theory that they wanted to investigate and it's like okay clearly they were trying really
hard right to like to like find find some theory but it like i don't know it just it kind of like
throughout the the the the party and the government there was just sort of i don't know if it's i don't
know how this stuff works i mean i've never been in government oh my god it's just like a quiet consent
um the the uh consumer financial protection bureau is uh started to investigate and incidentally
they did this in um 2024. let's just be clear here they've been investigating and probably for a year
up to that so it's not like oh they came in in the day and they hated us um because facebook and this may
come as a real surprise because this guy i'm just up there i just created this so people could connect
with each other and check out if somebody else was hot i had no idea that we were scraping everybody's
data and that's the way that i became a billionaire i just woke up one morning and i got this big check
from the business people and now all of a sudden i now know that elizabeth warren is coming after us yeah
what they have this theory that um that the uh financial products and services that are being
sold on meta uh may be problematic and scamming people i mean right that's what they say an effing
break they first requested that information in 2021 and then brought the the uh basically the probe in
2024. so he has those two things he has the antitrust lawsuit that he's staring down the barrel of
um that could basically threaten his uh control over instagram and whatsapp uh at meta and then to
that cfpb probe about potentially uh illegally uh using third-party financial data to target ads
and this is exactly what andresen said almost word for word when we covered that in november
on joe rogan's podcast the thing about elizabeth warren and the cfpb
um and like the natural follow-up to when he goes on the screed here would be like
what are they saying they're investigating you for does he ask that question another thing we should
find out i don't know how this stuff works i mean i've never been in government i don't know if it's
like a directive or it's just like a quiet consensus that like we don't like these guys they're not doing
what we want we're gonna punish them but um but it's uh don't piss down tell me it's really it's
tough to be at the other end of that what was it like um well it's not good i think the thing that
i think is actually the toughest though is um it's it's global right so and really when you think about
it the u.s government should be defending its companies right not be the tip of the spear attacking
its companies so when we so we we talk about a lot what is the experience of um okay if the
u.s government comes after you i think the real issue is that when the u.s government does that
to its tech industry um it's basically just open season around the rest of the world okay first off
like now it's not just that the american government hates us the european governments also hate us for
no reason how come for no reason everybody hates us and all i'm doing i don't know about this
business stuff i'm just trying to go out there and have some fun we're a good old american company
mr trump don't you love us joe you want to come let's go let's go watch a ball game or something
come on everybody they're defending the american people from you and your predatory business practices
which on top of other things are spying on their kids what is predatory what is that big word i don't
know what that means you hate me this is just like honestly like this is this feels like a movie like
there was a movie made it might have been even too generous to him at the time i know but this feels
like uh what's that movie where they have the kids play all the gangsters uh i mean it's from the 70s
it's uh it's like they have the kids play all the gangster all the roles are played by kids right
it's just like this is so baby brained and yet andresen oh hey man i'm just like uh i mean it's
just this is so such a pipeline all of these guys incidentally all these guys also spy the out of you
bugsy malone thank you all these guys spy i mean this is like you know you can have all of these sort of
like conspiracy theories about the cia the fbi and all this here it is all laid out in front of you
we just have this guy come on do a performance pretend like the government regulatory whatever
that means agencies are coming after us for you know uh allowing fraud and us profiting off of the
fraud that uh financial scams that we basically advertise on our thing or the data scraping we do
of all their material whatever i don't even know what all that means man it's like we're just trying
to have the party tick tock tick tock was banned for the same things that facebook and all these
other american companies do but what the price that tick tock wasn't willing to pay is to have their ceo
bootlick the incoming administration this gratuitously that's the only difference and honestly
does what facebook does like when i think about like american technology companies protecting american
technology companies well you know you got like uh elon musk who got billions from the american uh
taxpayer and then when basically built all his stuff in china these guys um it seems like tick tock can be
replicated it seems like social media can be replicated i'm not saying like we don't have this like
proprietary like all of the american industry you just fired how many thousands of americans i mean
give me an f how many did did did can you search the transcript did rogan ask zuckerberg about h1b
abuse at any time in this three-hour conversation with a uh billionaire we should uh search that
is that to its tech industry um it's basically just open season around the rest of the world
where i mean the the eu i pulled these numbers the eu has fined the tech companies more than 30
billion dollars over the last i think it was like 10 or 20 years holy oh my god that's it
i'll pause it for a second 30 billion dollars oh my god that's almost five percent of elon musk's net worth
uh holy cow meta is worth 1.53 trillion dollars holy cow man one of the tech companies whoa that's crazy
all the tech companies combined worth multiple they've been fined for no reason right just because
they hate you and you know what the eu's reasoning and the fun and the fine mechanism that is being used
there is also their equivalent of antitrust so perhaps this is because you guys are way too big
and have way too much control over everybody's information and what people are consuming and
they have nothing to offer physically all they do they've they've reached a saturation point the the
glasses and the virtual reality or whatever these are like things that rich people can buy because
they're five thousand dollars now they're at a point where they don't they have to continue to grow
their market share for their shareholders and they can't do it because they're not offering for
anything for anybody except data collection and now i guess hate hate speech and let's be clear
if facebook did not exist the number of tech companies in this country would be exponentially larger
because all the companies that they've bought to kill so they didn't compete against them all the
companies that they bought subsumed and then laid off all the people would exist or would have had a
better chance to grow yep so all this is just and incidentally he's also this is he's also now telling
you what the tell is what the ask is from trump because he knows trump largely speaking is not going to
pursue the antitrust stuff that they that the biden administration did but now he's also like saying
well they're not protecting american companies the u.s government is they should be protecting us
whoa whoa gee how would they do that mr zuckerberg well i don't know maybe if trump wanted to threaten
tariffs on european countries unless they lay off us there that might be something to do but i don't know
all that international stuff let us spine your kids europe yeah i don't get all that complicated
stuff 10 or 20 years holy when you think about it like okay there's it's like you know 100 million
dollars here a couple billion dollars there but what i think really adds up to is this is sort of
like a kind of eu-wide policy for how they want to deal with american tech it's almost like a tariff
and oh really tariff did somebody say tariff well maybe we should it's almost like a tariff you mean
these fines for breaking european laws like a tariff so why do we have tariffs too i mean this is just
well it's for an audience of one it's for an audience of one and but there's 20 million 25 million
people who are being dumbed down by this stuff and that and in rogan again either is an idiot or just
like willfully playing along you know the only thing that it gives them a reaction and all the sort of
lies it's like literally talk about like uh you know uh baby bird feeding this is like this is just gruel
and it's just like pouring into uh rogan's you know system and just pouring out the other way this
is so this is one of the most disgusting things i've ever seen honestly so grossed out by this yes
and remember this is the guy incidentally rogan who when i went on uh uh patrick bett david's show
to say that people making over three million dollars annually should get taxed 90 cents on each
dollar after three million this idiot doesn't know anything about what it is to make three million
dollars unbelievable it's almost like a tariff and i think the u.s government basically gets to
decide how are they going to deal with that right because if the if the u.s government if if um if some
other you know country was screwing with another industry that we cared about the u.s government would
probably find some way to put pressure on them but i think what happened here is actually the complete
the intent the u.s government led the the kind of attack against the companies which then just made
it like the eu is basically in all these other places just free to just go to town on all the
american companies but incidentally he's got the clock wrong it was the opposite that happened
eu has much better rules on data scraping and data protection and whatnot and we have followed their lead
he's lying oh yeah the truth is like this is the only uh place that billionaires can
go with this stuff because a social network at that size it frankly should be under the post office's
jurisdiction and uh all the growth things and algorithms get that out of there just have a
place where people can find the people that they know online but he has this and we have to like
make it be some massive profit seeker so now we're going to try to like farm the hogs anti-vax hogs
and all these other places just free to just go to town on all the american companies and do whatever you
want but i mean look obviously like i don't want to come across as if like we don't have things that
we need to do better obviously we do and when we mess something up we deserve to be held accountable
for that and and just like everyone else um i do think that the american technology industry is a
bright spot in the american economy i think it's a strategic advantage for the united states that
we have a lot of the strongest uh companies in the world and i think it should be part of the
us's strategy going forward to defend that okay no no it's not it's actually not true these companies
the amount of useless speculation that has been poured into these social media companies that are
just there at this point in their like gestation are just there to suck your data away and sell it to
advertisers the amount of money that is invested in them is completely unsustainable i mean we have
a bunch of just like speculative bubbles that could be cropping up and just things to look out for
whether it's in we saw there was some fears about the commercial real estate bubble before but
cryptocurrency and all that speculation is going to be a huge issue for our economy i think as well
this too if the american economy is reliant on these on these companies that have nothing again
physical to offer except what i just said then we're in deep trouble it's actually gonna we
create much more resiliency in our economy to break these people up but he's lying because
he has his own wealth to worry about i mean western capitalists they look at the america and the tech
sector because that's where profits can be made by people who just want to make money with money and
not actually do any work um i think it's a uh huge dead end um because you look at what say china is
doing putting money behind important things like uh d fossil fuel high-speed rail exactly or electric
cars and we're not doing any of that because people like this are around about ai and cryptocurrency and
free speech and you know it looks good to investors so that's what we're going to continue sinking
money into is this dumb it's unbelievable all right well we we're gonna have to play more of this uh
yeah uh zuckerberg stuff tomorrow but he honestly it is it is it's beyond gross how the multi-millionaire
rogan brings these uh multi-millionaires on and um simps flates them uh in such a way and while these
guys are just lying and so obviously lying and uh so that they can ultimately screw all of rogan's listeners
that's what's going on here and i don't know if rogan is a willing participant or just too dumb or
just too odd but i've got billionaires hanging out with me now i got billionaires in the green room and
mothership man yeah all of a sudden no longer interested in ubi because people don't want to
work hard exactly exactly the everyman he's an everyman you're a fool if you believe that or even if
you like pay lip service to it he's a loser um we got we got more clips we got we'll get it's 246.
but yeah i wonder if uh speaking in the green room i wonder if jared kushner was there backstage
