Human brain size has been declining for the last 10,000 years.
We distribute the overall brain power amongst the society,
so it could be that we're becoming more of a superorganism.
The rise of the Industrial Revolution in Europe
has to do with the consolidation of Europe's collective brain.
The key event is the spread of a particular form
of Christianity into Europe.
The destruction of the kinship group
opens the floodgates to people moving around.
In a world where the Roman Empire never existed,
do you still have this collective brain in Europe emerge?
Really, human history is a story of these different expansions.
The Dorset probably had better technology,
but they expanded, they spread out, their languages diversified,
they lost contact, and they began losing technology.
The way human bureaucracy's institutions work
is they kind of corrode from the interior,
just the way cancer spreads in a cell.
So you just got to kill it and make a new one.
Today, I have the pleasure of chatting with Joseph Henrich,
who is a professor of human evolutionary biology
at Harvard University and an author of two of my favorite books,
The Weirdest People in the World, and before that,
The Secret of Our Success.
And I was just mentioning to you that I remember reading this,
I don't know, many, many years ago when I was in college,
and at the time, I didn't think I would get a chance
to ask you questions about it.
I recently had your colleague David Reich on,
and we were discussing certain things in the record
of human history where he said, like, look,
eventually you just got to have Joseph Henrich on
and ask him these questions because he's the one who would know.
So let me ask you one of the questions which I was super intrigued by,
which he raised, and we didn't come up to an answer to.
So one of the things he's discovered through his genetic evidence
is that 70,000 years ago, across Eurasia,
there's so many different human species
from the Denisovans to the Neanderthals to the hobbits.
And then, apparently, there's this one group,
which was potentially the size of 1,000 to 10,000 people,
in the Near East, which subsequently explodes,
and now everybody who's descended from Eurasia
descends from this one group.
And so I guess the question is, like, what happened?
What did they figure out?
Yeah, so a typical assumption when people think about this,
if you put it in the Paleolithic,
they assume that it has to do with some kind of genetic changes.
Now, Reich's lab, you know,
there's no obviously big changes in the DNA,
so it's a little bit of a puzzle.
Neanderthals, for example, had larger brains.
And in primates, larger brains usually goes along
with more computational abilities,
more ability to solve problems.
So the expanding variant out of the Middle East,
out of Africa, might have actually been less able
at an individual level to process information.
But if you look back over the more recent period
of human history, you can see that it's a story
of expansions of different populations.
So, for example, in Africa,
we have the Bantu expansion about 5,000 years ago,
which actually eliminates a whole bunch
of hunter-gatherer populations
that previously existed in Africa.
We have the remnant populations in parts of the Congo,
in the Kalahari, in the Hadza, for example, in Tanzania.
If you look at the Austronesian expansion,
so that's the peopling of the Pacific.
That was the expansion of one group of people
at the expense of others.
And, of course, the Neolithic expansion into Europe
is another example.
So really, human history is a story
of these different expansions.
And it could be that this expansion across Eurasia,
which then led to interbreeding,
so we know it's the same species.
Humans interbred with Denisovans and Neanderthals,
as well as probably other species.
There's a ghost species in there.
This could be just institutional changes.
So if you have institutions, for example,
that interconnect your population,
you can maintain more sophisticated technology.
And some paleoanthropologists, for example,
have speculated, with some evidence,
that the expanding populations had projectile weapons,
so bows and arrows.
And humans have periodically gained and lost bows and arrows
in different parts of the world.
So in Australia, for example,
bows and arrows are never invented.
In the New World,
when the arrivals populations
probably didn't have bows and arrows,
but then later developed bows and arrows.
It's also really interesting
how some technologies you would just think of
as extremely,
I don't know what the word is,
but the New World,
like not having the wheel or something,
is, I guess,
it kind of makes sense
with like no domesticated animals,
but again, it's like such a...
Right.
Although the New World,
everybody has dogs,
and you can pull carts with dogs.
Yeah.
So I've never really bought that.
And of course,
you can use llamas in the New World
to pull carts as well.
People do that today.
Yeah, so what's your explanation
for why there's no wheels in the New World?
So my...
Well, so there were wheels on Mayan carts
or Mayan toys.
My explanation is just the collective brain.
So almost every single first invention
of something big
that we think is important for humans
was invented in Eurasia.
And Eurasia,
as Jared Diamond famously pointed out,
building on other people's work,
it's the largest continent by far.
It has the biggest population.
It's also oriented along an east-west axis,
which allows ideas and people
to more easily flow.
And there's a belt,
which the historian Ann Morris
calls the Lucky Latitudes,
which runs from basically southern China
all the way through to the Mediterranean.
And ideas are just flowing
back and forth there.
Hmm, interesting.
But you also ended up
with more complex state bureaucracies
and the kinds of things
that allow you to organize
and move people around and whatnot.
Hmm.
And what's the explanation
for why the collective brain
leads to state capacity,
or is it the other way around?
Well, you can think of institutions
that eventually lead to state capacity
as just part of the innovative process
of the collective brain.
So if you have more groups
experimenting with more different ways
of governing groups of people,
gradually you get the accumulation
of the pieces
that you can put together
into different kinds of states.
Got it.
Okay, so going back
to what happened 70,000 years ago,
is the basic answer like
it could be something like Bose,
but we don't know exactly what it was?
Or is it-
Yeah, we definitely don't know
exactly what it was.
So we know that this population expanded,
and there does seem to be
some tool indications
to suggest more complex technology.
Probably technology usually goes along
with social organization.
So for example,
if you look at Australia,
which is a continent
of hunter-gatherers,
there's an expansion
about 6,000 years ago
out of Northern Australia,
which eventually takes up
seven-eighths of the continent.
And they had a new social organization,
including rules about who you marry.
You had linguistic exogamy.
And rituals
that interconnected populations.
So rather than having local rituals
and local myths,
many communities would get together
periodically to initiate the young men.
And this would help bond
that whole group.
There'd be an exchange of technology
and teaching that goes on at these.
They'd spend a few months
in the same place.
So there was a lot of time
for transmission.
And then in terms of mechanism,
so if it's the case
that you have these sort of
convalescing waves
of expansion,
and David Reich's lab's evidence
suggests that this expansion
was quite violent
based on, you know,
whether the genes are passed down
through the maternal line
or the paternal line.
When you think about the mechanism
in which technologies develop
or the social institutions develop,
how much of it is like,
look, there's all these different groups
that are trying different things,
and one of them
maybe figures something out,
and then they just kind of explode?
And how much of it is
that within each group,
they are experiencing
sort of accumulations
of learning over time.
And it's not necessarily
a selective process.
It's more a sort of
accumulative process.
Well, eventually,
the groups have to meet
and they're going to compete
over territories.
And a bunch of different things
can occur.
So groups can copy each other.
So we know that
from the ethnographic record
and historical cases,
sometimes a group will say,
oh, those guys have
really good technology tools.
Maybe they'll get some migrants
or something like that.
And then they can adopt
the practices.
So that definitely happens.
But there's also plenty
of evidence of violent conflict.
And the Reich Lab's evidence
and lots of other ancient DNA
suggest that there are
these dead-end genetic lineages.
So, I mean,
the Neanderthals are dead-end
in a sense,
although we interbred with them,
so they're in us in some sense.
But they don't have
their own pure lineage
or anything like that.
And if you had to guess,
so whenever this big wave happens,
is it more of a sort of
concrete technology
or is it more of a,
I mean, especially if you consider
the range of expansion
that can often happen, right?
It's like literally
that same group
goes from Siberia to England.
Maybe it's like,
it's hard to imagine
it's like a single technology
that lets you explore
this wide range.
But it's also like
the idea that like
some cultural artifact
is enough that like
it gets transmitted
over tens of thousands of years
and that's what gives you the edge.
I'm curious how you think about like
what could possibly be
this like driving engine?
The way I describe it
in The Secret
is that it's a package of things.
So another good example
would be the Inuit expansion
out of the north slope of Alaska.
And they expand
all the way across the Arctic
and eventually get to Greenland.
And they have a whole package
of social practices
which helps keep them interconnected.
And then they have bows and arrows
which the group
they're exterminating
as they go along,
the Dorset,
doesn't have.
They have dogs and sleds.
They have,
along the coast,
they have boats.
So they're doing whaling.
So there's a whole package
that puts together
that allows them to out-compete
and eventually exterminate
the Dorset.
And one of the things
that happens though
is the Dorset probably
had better technology
but they expanded,
they spread out,
their languages diversified,
they lost contact
and they began losing technology.
So you want to see this
as a dynamic pulse.
There were probably expansions
and then collapses,
another expansion,
another collapse, right?
Oh, interesting.
It's not one giant
long march to victory.
And then this process
which has happened
many times
where the population
gets cut off
or something,
is that,
when you say
it's a sort of cycle,
is there some reason
why the,
over time
that knowledge
gets fragmented
and breaks apart
and populations disperse?
Yeah, I think
there's a cultural evolutionary
dynamic that's part of this
because languages
will naturally diversify
and then as that diversify
there's less contact.
People sometimes
get inclined to marry
endogamously
and especially
if there's enough people
around locally,
why go all the way
over there?
And those people
are getting more
culturally different
so they're seeming
a little bit like outsiders
and then, yeah.
Interesting, okay.
So the tough part
that humans have always had
is to stay unified
because of the natural effect
of geography
and learning locally
is going to tend
to fragment us.
So in The Secret,
you describe this interesting
startup problem
where if you don't have
that much accumulated
cultural knowledge,
developing the ability
to do social learning
isn't as valuable
but if you don't have
the ability to do
social learning,
you don't have that much
accumulated cultural knowledge
in your tribe or group.
So how is this problem solved?
Yeah, so before I get
to solving the problem,
I just want to sketch
for the listeners
that the question is
why is this cumulative
cultural evolutionary process
that is so important
for humans
relatively uncommon
in the natural world?
It seems like just our lineage.
I mean, there was a bunch
of splinoff lineages
but now it's just us.
So to understand that
is this idea
that you just mentioned
where you're imagining
an increase in brain tissue
that's going to be costly
and I can put that
towards individually
figuring the problem
out for myself
or I can put it
into learning from others
and in a world
without very much
cumulative culture,
there's not going to be
very much useful information
in the minds
of everybody else
so I should use
that brain tissue
for individually
solving problems
and so it's hard
to get this runoff
where our brains
get bigger
for the purposes
of learning from others.
So, and then the question
is how do you get
past that valley?
So the case I make
in secret
is that in the,
say, 3 million years ago,
2 million years ago,
there were several factors
that came together.
The first factor
is the rate
of change of environments.
So you get this increase
in the fluctuation
of environments
so you're getting
more environmental changes
and in cultural evolution
a lot of theory
shows that
there's a certain
rate of change
which is favorable
to cultural evolution.
It's got to be slow enough
so that the information
is of your parents
and the previous generation
is useful
but not so slow
that you might as well
just encode it
in the genes.
So that's one.
Second thing is
we're a ground dwelling ape
which means we have hands
like chimpanzees
and gorillas
and we can potentially
use tools and whatnot
but unlike them
our ancestors
may have been
savannah dwelling apes
which meant
we may have lived
in large groups.
So in mammals,
mammals live in larger groups
when they have to deal
with predators
and the predator guild
in Africa
at that point
was quite thick.
There were a lot
of deadly predators
so paleoanthropologists
think that our ancestors
may have lived
in large savannah dwelling apes
and if you have
a lot of individuals
if the culture is sparse
the bigger the group
the more chance
that there's someone
doing something useful
in the larger group
and so that means
it's easier to get
across the threshold.
So those are three
of the main factors
that might have allowed
our lineage
as opposed to
all the other lineages
around to cross this.
We were already
a big brain primate.
We had hands.
We're living in these
large groups on the savannah
and the climate change
during this period
so as to make us.
Yeah.
And how big
were these groups?
Well, I mean
nobody's really sure
but maybe
a few hundred individuals.
And before
the agricultural revolution
was there still
this transmission
of information
across different groups?
Yeah.
So, I mean
lots of different evidence
suggests that groups
were moving
trade goods.
So well back
in the Paleolithic
we see trade.
Often we see
some genetic transmission.
Right, the expansions
and so forth.
And so
talking about
the expansion
like that's something
where the ancient DNA
is useful
because the Neanderthals
in Europe
the DNA suggests
they lived in
very small groups
but the DNA
of the expanded group
suggests a larger population.
So those would have been
two different
collective brains
there as well.
So in The Secret
you discuss
a lot of these
lost European explorers
with modern technologies
as of at least
a couple centuries ago
encountering peoples
who have for tens
of thousands of years
discovered ways
of hunting
and processing foods
and so forth
without which
even these people
with modern technology
will starve.
And as I was reading that
I was wondering
I'm still not sure
how I understand
the process by which
if you need
there's like a 10 step process
to making sure
this bean
is actually nutritious
and without it
without any one
of those steps
you might like poison
yourself or something.
And it's like
at no point do you understand
why this process works
you don't have
a scientific explanation.
How do you even like
learn that
in the first place?
Right.
So if you
I mean one of the things
we know
even in young children
there's a tendency
to preferentially learn
from healthier
more successful individuals
and so
if you're processing
it better
so something like
bitter cassava
which has cyanide in it
if you just eat
bitter cassava
it won't taste great
so if you then
rinse it somewhat
it'll taste better
and maybe you could eat it
but you're going to
accumulate cyanide
over the long run
so it doesn't kill you
right away
but if you do
this whole long process
that the populations
in South America
develop
then you're totally fine
you never get
any accumulation
so you can imagine
that initially
this is going to be
very strong
and people are going
to sort of do
sensible things
but then it gets
a little more mysterious
and we know this
because bitter cassava
gets transported to Africa
and Africans immediately
begin eating it
improperly processed
and getting goiter
and the cyanide processing
that goes along with it
so then that's going
to be a slow evolution
where groups that do this
are going to be
more successful
and individual families
are going to be
more successful
so for example
you might have a household
where they process
the cassava
more seriously
than another family
and they're going
to have more kids
and they're going
to be like
oh that family's
really good
and then people
copy what they do
in all kinds of ways
but one of them
could be copying recipes
but I guess it depends
on the mechanism
of selection here
because when you consider
the different ways
in which two different
individuals might be different
or two different households
or even two different groups
I guess it makes sense
why cyanide poisoning
is such a deleterious effect
that it is like a noticeable
or you know
like quite a strong signal
but something
I mean I think
you discussed some other ideas
in The Secret
where it's like
the sort of spices
in a region
sort of match
the antimicrobial properties
or the antifungal properties
you need
for the
you know
to like stay
I guess clean
or whatever
in that particular region
but when I think about
like okay
so it sounds like
a small effect
and how could
such a small effect
actually
create a strong enough signal
that when you're deciding
who to copy
you notice that like
this family is healthier
because they like
spice their food
in a certain way
or this like group
like takes over
the area
because they
Yeah I mean
it has to be
a big enough effect
to matter
but I think
if you go back
to a world
where you know
there's a lot
of improperly processed meat
people don't have
refrigerators
and the leading cause
of death in children
is diarrhea
people carry
high pathogen loads
if you can knock
that pathogen load down
we know from
modern research
if you know
you want to make
people healthier
and even smarter
right IQ goes up
if you knock
the pathogen load down
Got it
so
this process
of cultural accumulation
you're talking about
you think it like
is not strong enough
to pick up
minor
increases
in fitness
and like
it actually has to be
like quite a significant
thing for it to like
I think it operates
a lot like natural selection
in the sense that
natural selection
will pick up tiny things
if you give it long enough
right
so cultural evolution
will do the same thing
if you give it long enough
because you know
just small differences
in who you're paying
attention to
will affect things
but it might take
a thousand years
as opposed to decades
right
yeah
but we know culture
can spread
adaptive traits
super quickly
if it's a really big effect
yeah
so this
the situation
in which our ancestors
found themselves
in some ways
it's sort of like
epistemic hell
in the sense of like
you don't know why
certain things are working
but you do know
that if you
break a tradition
you might just
doom yourself
and your family
and that maybe
as you discussed
like causes these
like religious beliefs
and taboos
and mystical
understandings of the worlds
to arise
where you just like
think like
look you're gonna burn in hell
if you don't do this
ten step process
for refining your beans
or something
like in some sense
this like requires you
to abdicate reason
because you have to just be like
I don't understand this
this is the way
it's been done
so we're gonna do it
basically
how much of reason
do you necessarily
have to abdicate
to survive in the
ancestral environment
I mean one of the ways
we research this
is by going out
to societies
that make bows and arrows
or have food taboos
that protect them
from dangerous marine toxins
and ask them questions
about why they do it
and see if they
and they don't understand
the underlying causal stuff
right
but then why do they say
they do it
well because that
for what typical answer
is that it's our custom
um yeah
or it's for you know
important to people
around here
to do it this way
so we do it this way
so just Hadza bows
for example
you know
I didn't do this
with Sir Jacob Harris
and Kim Hill
and Rob Boyd did it
but they asked Hadza
about their bows
and about how they work
and what the mechanics are
so they understood some stuff
so you use the bow
and you get some
mechanical understanding
but if you ask them
you know
what if you used
a different wood
uh different materials
and they had never
tried anything else
but what they learned
how to make this bow
so they didn't
you know
they couldn't speak
to a lot of that stuff
and the things about
the compression of the wood
is very important
I didn't understand
okay so that's quite
interesting right
because you would think
that you have to
transmit cultural knowledge
over time
but you also need
to experiment
in order to innovate
but it sounds like
because of the belief
in these customs
you would be less inclined
to innovate
right
and the thing is
once something gets good
doing it differently
almost always makes it worse
right
so
and then
there's also
some things are just different
because people do it
randomly different
like they make a mistake
so
I think people often
underestimate the power
of error
in generating novelty
one question I have
is why this process
of cultural learning
so you know
humans have extended
childhoods
presumably as a
to give us more time
to accumulate culture
and then
we live after menopause
presumably because
older people
our grandparents
can teach us about
the situation
we find ourselves in
and
like
18 years is such a long time
and when I think back
to like
I mean obviously
I didn't grow up
in the ancestral environment
but when I think back
to like what I was doing
as a teenager
I don't think I was like
learning that much
I was just like
less productive
for no sort of like
obvious biological reason
so I guess I don't
intuitively understand
why this process
of cultural learning
is
it takes decades
and
yeah
why it can't happen
more rapidly
well you probably
as an adolescent
were in school right
so you were probably
accumulating some stuff
in school maybe
and here's an interesting
fact about
hunters
so
anthropologists
have studied hunters
hunter gathering societies
in different places
and
the physical peak
that at least males have
is in their early 20s
right
that's when they run
the fastest
they got the best eyesight
but the best hunters
in the community
are 36 to 40
right
they're not as fast
as those guys
but they just know
they know the track
they know the animals
you know
they know exactly
what to do
in these different
and then hunting skill
begins to decline
because basically
the physicality of things
begins to catch up
and so there's this
kind of cycle
and at 18
young hunters
aren't even producing
enough food
to feed themselves
so it's not until
they get into their 20s
that they're actually
in surplus
and bringing food home
for everybody else
so there's just
and you need to know
hundreds at least
animals
you need to know
animal behavior
you gotta be able
to spot tracks
and spore
and there's just
we're just very
knowledge dependent
in terms of our
hunting and gathering
given the
I mean
what you just said
and also the experience
of these European explorers
suggest that like
you just gotta know
a lot of shit
to make it in any sort
of environment on earth
but then like
there's all these
other animals
and they seem so dumb
and they seem like
able to get by
so like
why did humans
have such a hard time
of it
yeah well so I think
we offloaded a lot
of stuff into culture
so in one of my
lost European explorers
there's a case where
they're in Australia
and they have camels
and the camels escape
and now central Australia
has lots of feral camels
so the camels survive
the lost European
explorer challenge
because they have
innate instincts
they can smell water
a mile away
they can detoxify foods
in their own
they have a complex
digestive system
that detoxifies
we've lost all that
and we're worse
than chimpanzees
at detoxifying foods
because we have
all these cultural practices
that do the work
so we've externalized
detoxification
and a lot of digestion
actually
I had this
independent researcher
and internet writer
called Guern Franwen
on my podcast
a couple months ago
and we were discussing AI
and I asked him
so his theory is very much
like the brain became bigger
more intelligence
and so then I asked him
like look if it's this simple
why did it take so long
for evolution
to discover intelligence
in the first place
and he had this
interesting answer
which is that
there's a very narrow
in terms of like
the signal that evolution
is giving you
there's a very narrow
gap between
skills that are so useful
that they should like
just be distilled
as an instinct
into your genome
and then skills
that are so worthless
that they're not worth
learning in the first place
and so this narrow gap
that's like
you need that
generalization ability
like it's like
not so primal
that like
you know
you're not going to
culturally learn hunger
you're just going to be
in your genome
I don't know
if that sounds like
an interesting explanation
or helps explain anything
well
I mean
in cultural evolutionary
models
there are
a typical thing
would be to let genes
compete with individual
learning
to compete with cultural
learning
and it turns out
the rate of change
of the environment
affects that
so if the environment
is changing slowly
then you should
put it all in the genes
and if it's changing
a moderate speed
then culture
is the best way to go
and if it's fast
then individual learning
and the idea
the individual learning
is favored
because if it's changing
too quickly
the previous generation
doesn't know anything
worth knowing
because the world
you're dealing with
is just so much different
from their world
and so it's this
intermediate range
so myself and others
have argued
that the increase
in the frequency
of change
during the
Plioplaistocene transition
2.5 million years ago
is a change
that increases
the value
of cultural transmission
of learning
from others
I'm not sure
what your guest
was thinking
I mean
but as
our brains
are not very good
at solving problems
otherwise
they lost
European explorers
could survive
and human brain size
has been declining
for the last
10,000 years
so we've actually
been getting dumber
fewer neurons
less computational power
yeah
why has brain size
been declining
well
the collective brain
argument suggests
that
you
at a certain size
you'll begin
farming off specialists
so because
not
we have
there's a store
of knowledge
in the society
and we can all
be generalists
and learn how
to do all
the different skills
but at some point
it makes
efficiency sense
for us to specialize
in different skills
in order for that
to be the case
though we have
to have social
agreements of some
sort that allow us
to trade or exchange
things like that
so but then
once we're specializing
we don't necessarily
need as large a brain
because we distribute
the overall brain power
amongst the society
so it could be
that we're becoming
more of a superorganism
and you see the same
thing in ants
when ants get
specialized
occupational casts
their individual
brains shrink
interesting
what do you make
of I think
David Reich's lab
had a result
a month or two ago
where they showed
that the selective
pressure on
at least the European
samples
which is the samples
they studied
was that there's
been selection
for greater intelligence
over the last
10,000 years
I don't know if you saw
that or what you make
of that
well they didn't say
anything about
intelligence
they did use
the polygenic
score for education
but there was
no education
8,000 years ago
but then the question
is we don't know
what goes into that
is that actually
computational software
or I mean
people do well
in school
because they stick
to it
and they can sit
in the same place
for long periods
of time
I guess it would
be interesting
for them to
sort of deduct
the docility
polygenic score
from the education
because we don't
have a polygenic
score for
intelligence yet
well there are
IQ
so there are
polygenic scores
for IQ
I think they
actually did that
one as well
like you said
it's correlated
with education
and yeah
but that doesn't
have anything
that the things
that go into
giving you an IQ
I mean the
correlation between
brain size and IQ
is only about
well across populations
it's 0.24
so it's not
very big
so the other
thing is I mean
IQ is massively
misunderstood
so the way
to think about IQ
which has been
going up over
the 20th century
by quite a bit
so if you rescale
modern scores
to 1900
it's about 70
it's called
the Flynn effect
I think that
those are
cognitive abilities
for navigating
the institutional
world that we've
constructed
and a huge mistake
would be to assume
that those are
the right cognitive
abilities for the
next century
so it'll be
a different
constellation
if you study
we study herders
and cognitive abilities
of herders in
northern Namibia
and if you're
in northern Namibia
you gotta be able
to move through
the landscape
so being able
to just pick a direction
and know where
you're going
and not get lost
is super important
so different
suites of cognitive
abilities are favored
in different environments
this idea that
there's this generalized
thing applicable
across all human
environments
just doesn't
I mean
education massively
increases your IQ
right
if you're uneducated
you have a totally
different IQ
and then
is the way
in which your
horsepower is directed
is that a thing
that you think
is basically set
by the time
you're an adult
or like
if somebody's 30
now and the AI
thing is going
to happen
next
and they have
to like
totally reorient
away from knowledge
work
is that a thing
well so
I think it's a
it's a continuous
scale
so if you look
at human brains
they're developing
and continuing
to add new
connections and stuff
at least into
the mid-20s
now there could be
even more plasticity
after that
unlike chimps
we're still not
totally myelinized
for our whole lives
so there's
definitely room
it's just
there's less room
yeah
a quick word
from our sponsor
Scale AI
publicly available
data is running out

slash Dwarkesh
the kind of social learning
for which our learning biases
are fit right
like where you pay attention
to elders
because they've survived somehow
and they've accumulated
the knowledge from past generations
how much do you think
that actually
basically applies
to the way
in which the modern
knowledge work economy
accumulates knowledge
and how much do you think
it's just an artifact
of the kind of environment
our ancestors found themselves in
right now we're in Silicon Valley
or in San Francisco
and it's very common here
for a 20-something
to make a new product
or service
which without that much
they don't have that much context
in how the world works
but they can make
big innovations
and big changes
at the same time
people on average
maybe are more productive
in their 40s and 50s
in terms of wages
or something
so yeah basically
this sort of social learning
you're describing
how much does that
actually describe the world
as it exists today
yeah
so super important
so we'll take the patent database
and if you're
same-sex parent
it has to be same-sex
patents in a particular domain
you're nine times more likely
to patent in that same domain
and how do you just separate
the genetic versus cultural effect there
well so these are very fine domains
so we're talking about like
natural adhesives
versus synthetic adhesives
so unless you think there's genes for that
and same thing with transistors
and electronics
so very fine domains
and if you grow up in Silicon Valley
you're much more likely to patent
in general
but you're probably going to patent
in computers
but if you grow up in Boston
it's going to be biotech
so having a father or mother
who did biotech
and then growing up in Boston
you know it's an increasing
you're even more likely to biotech
and this is true
even if you move to New York
so if you look at people in New York
who are from Silicon Valley
and from Boston
the Bostoners are more likely
to patent in biotech
and the Silicon Valley kids
are more likely to patent in computing
so all the same rules apply
well I'm not sure
because maybe the
so maybe the like the location
you like learn a lot
from the environment
but the fact that it's just kids
and so you know
if you think these old rules
of cultural accumulation
and collective brains apply
you would think like
ah you're 50 by the time
you're writing your first useful line
of Python code or something
when in fact it's like
often a lot of these big innovations
come from people
who are much much younger
before they should have
accumulated much of the
know-how that this theory implies
well I guess I was thinking
so the model here
is what to focus your efforts on
so it's that
it's the throwing model
yeah
so if you grow up
in Silicon Valley
you focus your efforts
on learning how to
code or whatever
yeah
and so that means
that's where you're likely
to make the innovation
but in terms of
you know when there's
like 2% growth a year
and a lot of the technologies
that are dominant
in the economy today
or a lot of the industries
didn't even exist
many generations ago
basically does that
suggest this model
of like
or should we just
like mistrust
our instincts
of who to give prestige to
and what kinds of people
we want to pay attention to
whether it's professors
or elders
or whatever
yeah
so that
that's definitely
something I've thought about
and I wrote about
in Secret
which is that
and as the rate
of cultural change
gets faster
and we sort of talked
about this
with environmental change
the value of older
and older members
of the previous generation
declines
because the world
that they grew up in
and that they honed
their skills to
is quite different
from the current world
so you would expect
the degree to which
I mean optimally
you would look
less far back
or you would look
to relatively younger
individuals
to get your inspiration from
because the world
they adapted to
is closer to the world
you're going to need
to adapt to
speaking of Silicon Valley
let me ask you
a little bit about AI
so one of the reasons
to suspect
some incredibly sharp
discontinuity
from you know
the world
doesn't exist today
to a world
with AIs
and by AI
I don't mean
just like GPT-4
I mean like
replacement at least
for you know
anything you can do
on a computer screen
the AI can do
one of the reasons
to expect a sharp
discontinuity
is that
they have
potentially
the step function
increase
in social learning
and the ability
to accumulate knowledge
that maybe humans had
or the magnitude
of which
maybe humans had
when
between them
and non-human primates
and in particular
the fact
that you can just like
copy everything you know
like you don't have to like
teach a young person
right
you can like
because the constraints
of biology mean
you can't just
replicate brains
and also that
you have much more
efficient communication
you don't have to
communicate through words
you can just like
shoot your brain state across
the population size
can grow arbitrarily large
so to the extent
of the collective brain
is the size of the population
and how interconnected it is
do you just expect
this like
you know
we wouldn't even recognize
the kind of world
these AIs can make
as a result of their
cultural skills
yeah no I mean
I definitely think
it's pretty interesting
and holds great potential
for expanding
the collective brain
there are little things
in there
which might make one worry
so if you study
the history of innovation
you find out that
for example
serendipitous meetings
are super important
so there's a great paper
on Silicon Valley
showing that
you know
companies will cross
cross reference
each other's patents
more likely when
the people at those companies
tend to frequent
the same coffee shops
and they track people
on their cell phones
and stuff to figure this out
so serendipitous meetings
are important
and improper copying
so a huge number
of innovations
are mistakes
where somebody copied
incorrectly
and then got something better
I read this interesting theory
that maybe evolution
designed transcription
and translation
to have more errors
than it might not
it might
it could otherwise have
just so that
you know
you can have this
like sparse reward
when you're close
to the right sequence
yeah yeah
so I think
that's a very interesting
area of research
and it makes good sense to me
I'm not sure
of the current state
of the evidence
but there are
different parts of the genome
are more or less
susceptible to mutation
which is kind of interesting
yeah
so going back to AI
maybe another way
to phrase it
is look
you're talking about
these serendipitous meetings
where you can learn
something another person knows
and the great advantage
these AIs have
is that
they can sort of like
meet with everybody at once
like you know
future versions of AI
as you can really imagine
like holding the whole
internet in context
right
so everything that
maybe these human groups
I mean will be equivalent
to like those people
isolated in Tasmania
according to the AIs
right
because like they just like
have everything in context
if you get a PhD
you can get a PhD
in every single field
and you can amortize that
across all your copies
right
yeah
so I mean
are you sort of like
banking on in the next 10 years
the you know
you're just going to be living
in the singularity
or something
because of your belief
in the value
of cultural knowledge
yeah
although I'm not
I haven't totally seen
I see there's various potentials
and I'm particularly interested
in using AIs
to augment
problem solving
in human groups
so you can imagine
getting the humans together
because the humans
have the big advantage
of having stuff
they care about
right
there's stuff
they want to invent
so I mean
the AI is still a tool
at some point
so I'm interested in that
but I'm interested
in how these things
like running out
of training data
is going to be dealt with
the value of making mistakes
and serendipity
if you get rid of
all those things
or how you're going
to reintroduce them
those kinds of things
yeah
I mean it's quite funny
because until recently
people were saying
the big issue with LLMs
is that they hallucinate
and make mistakes
and at some level
hallucination is no different
than creativity
maybe there's a way
to harness that right
but maybe we just
didn't know how to harness it
that's right
what do you make of the idea
that you could have
AI firms
or AI tribes
whatever
the right way to think about it
is if like
the effective population size
that can communicate
with each other
is such an important contributor
to how much progress
a group in history
was able to make
if you could just like
literally run
billions of AIs
and they have
this immediate ability
to communicate
with each other
and again I'm not talking
about current models
I'm talking about like
future like human equivalent
basically I guess
I'm just throwing out
a bunch of different
intuition pumps
and I'm curious
which one you find
most promising
or most interesting
or do you just find
all of them
not as convincing
yeah I know
I don't have strong opinions
about any of this
but I do think
that one thing
that in order to make
all that work
is you know
humans are constantly
getting hit with shocks
right so there's
economic shocks
there's weather shocks
there's conflict
with other groups
there's pandemics
and the shocks
have big effects
on how things go
they inject new information
into the system
so I'd worry about
a system that is
too homogeneous
and doesn't have
enough noise
adding shocks
and new challenges
and things like that
one of the things
missing from our
conversation
is the kind of
creativity
that cultural evolution
has figured out
so to give you
an example
at some point
in human history
religions invented
big powerful
moralizing gods
and this may have
increased the
people's ability
to cooperate
so the kind of
forget about
the technological elements
some of the most
important features
of innovation
over human history
have been institutional
and things that get
people to cooperate
so in my work
I argue that
one branch of
Christianity
resulted in the
transformation
of the families
in European societies
into small monogamous
nuclear families
I'm not sure an AI
would have thought of that
cultural evolution
thought of it
because of how it
affected
how the societies
operated
so it sorted this out
over historical time
yeah
can I play with that idea
because that's quite interesting
so again
I think this might even
reinforce the
advantages of AIs
in this sense
so you know
to the extent that
this sort of
random fluke
by the
by the church
led to this
you know
modernity
and the great
divergence
or whatever
and it was a result
of like
there's a bunch
of variation
and then you can
select over
some group
that's doing
the right thing
the advantage
you have with AIs
is that
you can just
you can have
much more
high fidelity
replication of culture
and much more
sort of like
you can explore
a wider range
of potential cultures
sorry
and it sounds
really vague
when you talk
about AIs
in this way
so what do I mean
like one problem
companies have today
is that
suppose a company
is working really well
maybe it's like
early Apple
or early Tesla
or SpaceX
or something
and suppose it has to do
with the culture
or the people
or something
it's not clear
how you replicate
that culture
not only across
different institutions
right
it's like not clear
if I'm like
running a company
I don't know
how to copy SpaceX
you can't even
not only can you not
replicate it across institutions
you can't even
replicate it across time
so over time
many institutions
tend to decay
their culture fades
as people leave
or die
or something
and then imagine
if all of SpaceX
at least maybe
at the time
you thought it was
like the most effective
are just like
AIs where you know
every single byte
and when you
you can make a copy
of it a thousand times
and you can put it
against every single
hardware problem
we have in the world
and then you can
if you think
there's another team
that might have
some different culture
which is like better
you can do the same
thing with them
and culture here
includes not
only how they think
about their work
but also even
like how does the board
make decisions
right
do they do this
like Monte Carlo
tree simulation
do they
there's so many
different
things you could do here
so because of the
wider range
of possibilities
you can explore
and the fact
that you can have
higher fidelity
transmission
of cultural information
maybe the ability
to do this random
evolution
also increases
but I'm curious
to get your take
on that
yeah I mean
as a kind of
broad sketch
I think that
is pretty interesting
I mean
in the case of
I worry about
too high fidelity
replication
just because
it's important
to take like
the details
of historical context
and time
into account
so that same thing
if you fix it
it might not really
work a decade later
when everything else
around it has changed
right
so it's kind of
a moving target
but you could fix
that just by having
lots of different variants
that are different
versions of that
so yeah
that would be cool
sorry that gives us
a good opportunity
to go into weird
but before we get there
one more question
about before
the agricultural revolution
you know obviously
many groups around
the world were different
and many of those
differences were
probably inspired
by the fact that
they were living
in different environments
so they needed
to come up with
different technologies
and adaptations
to survive best there
how much
just random
differences
that had nothing
to do with their
environment
do you expect
there to have been
you know in terms of
I don't even know
what the right category
would be like
but in the modern world
you might imagine
something like
does a society
have slavery or not
and maybe
pre-modern societies
all had slavery
so that's not the
right way to think
about variation
but that kind of like
yep
so I think
there's lots of
reason to think
there was lots of
variation
and one of the ways
that researchers
study this
is they look at
ecological variables
and they compare it
to phylogenetic variables
and here they mean
cultural phylogeny
so if your ancestral
populations
had matrilineal
matrilocal social
organization
how likely are you
to have it
controlling for ecology
and it turns out
both of these things
matter
people adapt
to their ecology
but you can still
see the signal
of past society
so some degree
of fidelity
of transmission
of social institutions
how we make
our baskets
those kinds of things
there's lots of
examples in the
modern world
and we see this
all over the place
so if you look
at gender inequality
in the modern world
you find that a history
of the plow
leads to greater
gender inequality
so males had a particular
advantage in using the plow
because it requires
upper body strength
this meant males
became the dominant force
in economic production
at the household level
and that even today
in populations
where nobody
most people
aren't farmers
this persists
so this is cultural
persistence
that has to do
with whether you
had the plow
so this is work done
by Alberto Alicina
and Nathan Nunn
a former postdoc
of mine
now at the Harvard
Business School
Anke Becker
has done a similar
thing with pastoralism
so if your ancestors
were pastoralists
you tend
and pastoralists
for various reasons
have quite strong
gender norms
that persists
into the modern world
and still shapes
for example
female entrepreneurship
interesting
and the reason
I'm especially curious
about this
is because it informs
the following question
if the industrial revolution
didn't happen in Europe
but started somewhere else
how different
would the world
look like today
so obviously
you discussed
the fact that
breaking apart
these kin ties
was necessary
for the industrial revolution
but to the extent
that was necessary
whichever place
had the industrial revolution
first would have had that
right
but I mean
separate from
the technologies
or cultural practices
which were necessary
for the industrial revolution
in the first place
still how different
would the world look
like how much variation
was possible
given our level
of technology
yeah I have a lot
of trouble
trying to answer that
because so say
I mean China
or some place
in the middle east
might have been
the obvious alternative
place for the industrial
revolution to happen
but I feel like
you have to give
those places
a lot of stuff
that developed
only in Europe
so for example
universities begin spreading
in the high middle ages
so you'd want them
to have universities
you'd want them
to have universal schooling
which began to spread
and wasn't present
in these places
prior to that
so that begins to spread
in this
well 16th 17th century
and so
by the time
you add all this stuff
it basically starts
to look a lot like Europe
so
interesting
and these are all things
that are global now
right
so the universal schooling
that we find
around the world today
you know
begins with the
Protestant Reformation
you know
in Germany
and then later England
right
universities models
are the European
university
and globalized
I guess
one obviously
very salient example
of variance
which might not
have been replicated
but I'm curious
if you think
it might have been
is
it seems like
the British Empire
was like the first
thing in history
first major institution
which decided
like slavery
is just morally wrong
and we're gonna
throw our weight around
to eliminate it
and it seems like
I don't know
if you think
that sort of
just naturally follows
the development
of social technologies
that the Industrial Revolution
would have brought about
but that seems
super contingent
but I'm curious
if you disagree
well so my story
is that
the rise of the
Industrial Revolution
in Europe
has to do with
the consolidation
of Europe's
collective brain
and one of the things
that requires
is trust in strangers
and at least
the beginnings
of moral universalism
and it's that
moral universalism
that eventually
causes the British
to say
we've got to stop
with the slave trade thing
and you know
it's a moral decision
that they make
because it's no longer
consistent with the
changing moral values
over time
right
okay so we've been
dancing around
this
the thesis of
your book
following the secret
which is
the weirdest people
in the world
and before we just
sort of like
really jump into it
maybe you can give me
a summary of
what the thesis there is
yeah
so the
first observation
is that
there's a great deal
of global psychological
variation around the world
so European
American
Australian populations
tend to be highly
individualistic
they're inclined
towards analytic thinking
over holistic thinking
they have a lot of
impersonal pro-sociality
so trust in strangers
they're against conformity
willingness to cooperate
with strangers
so the question is
how can we explain
the global variation
in these features
of psychology
and towards the end
of the book
I actually connect
these features
of the psychology
to economic differences
including the
industrial revolution
that happened in Europe
which reshapes the world
and the story is
is that
the key event
is the spread
of a particular form
of Christianity
into Europe
where the Catholic Church
what becomes
the Catholic Church
systematically dismantles
the intensive
kinship systems
in Europe
leading to small
monogamous
nuclear families
and this transformation
leads to the creation
of new institutions
so by the high middle ages
you get the rise
of guilds
which are voluntary groups
of craftsmen
and self-help societies
because people don't have
their families
to rely on
people begin moving around
there's occupational sorting
into different occupations
you get urbanization
is rising
charter towns
are on the rise
universities pop up
new kinds of monasteries
pop up
and then Europe
begins to urbanize
and you get
new kinds of law
that are based around
the individual
contract law
and then eventually
this leads to a lot
more innovation
because ideas are
flowing around Europe
and then eventually
the industrial revolution
so that's the
argument in a nutshell
can you explain again
what exactly
the church did
which led to the kin
based existing system
breaking down
yeah
so the church
outlaws polygyny
and so that
stops elite males
from having multiple
wives and concubines
and what not
and creating kind of
a giant family
through that
it outlaws
cousin marriage
going all the way
out to sixth cousins
at some point
and that included
spiritual kin
and other kinds of
sort of
non-genetic relatives
as well as the cousins
it frees up inheritance
so it has inheritance
by testimony
rather than normal
patrilineal inheritance
and a simple example
here is
in most societies
you get
you inherit access
to land corporately
so which means
you and your brothers
and stuff
all own the land
and it might be
your uncle
is actually in charge
of the land
your father's brother
and so you can't sell it
you can't move it around
and you're also tied to it
it's where your ancestors
are buried
so there's this big
importance of land
so the church allows
people to
give land to the church
the church becomes
the largest landowner
in Europe
because you can do it
by testament
so those are just
some of the examples
of the ways it transforms
the family structure
and eventually you get
these monogamous
nuclear families
which are basically
unheard of
around the world
at least if you look
at the anthropological record
and you can really see this
when you can compare
individuals can move
to European cities
as individuals
or nuclear families
in China
when you move to the city
you maintain contacts
with the folks back home
in the village
and people flow back
and forth
and you get these
little enclaves
of different clans
and stuff in the cities
and the connections
and this is really important
because you're ancestors
and there's rituals
that have to be done
back in the home community
but Christianity does away
with all those
ancestor rituals
okay great
let's jump into it
by starting before
much before even the church
I wonder how much of the
things that let's say
make Europe weird
existed even in antiquity
if you read
about like how Roman society worked
or how these Greek polities worked
already you have
like emphasis on nuclear families
you have these sort of
like universal norms around
hey we believe in republicanism
or we believe in democracy
and we like
the sort of like
the structure of the system
matters more necessarily
than I guess
at least before the empire
right
so yeah
was Europe already weird
before the things
this church did
well there were certainly
some interesting things
going on in Greece
and Rome
but I don't think
there's good evidence
that you had the kinds
of monogamous nuclear families
that you would find later
I mean even European law
is built around
patrilineage
so if your father's still alive
you are not a full citizen
you are under
you're in the patra house
so these large families
definitely intensive kinship
for sure
patrilineal
patrilocal
women of course
don't have any rights
and you know
republicanism
but the formation of Rome
is built around
a series of elite families
so it's a clan operation
and they call it republican
because the clans
all have some say
in what's going on
so people sometimes see
representative government
where it's not really
individuals being
representative
but families
and so this fools
a lot of people
into thinking
there was a lot more
individualistic voting
and things like that
there was actually
no voting
but yeah
so
and so in Greece
in Athens
Athens is unique
because it does
a bunch of things
in the laws of Solon
that break down
the intensive kinship
so for example
in Greece
you get monogamy
for the first time
and Athens
is considered unusual
so males can only
marry one Athenian woman
which has potentially
positive effects
among the competition
among Athenian men
but they can have
as many slave concubines
as they want
so when Christianity spreads
it ends the whole
slave concubine thing
which was also common
in Rome
and that's another effect
on this whole thing
I guess the extent
to which these practices
were already formed
hundreds or thousands
of years before
the church's intervention
maybe this suggests
that Europe was already
on the trajectory
and the church
didn't necessarily
move the needle that much
or what do you make
of that thesis?
Well we know that
I mean in the book
I talk about data
where we can look
at contemporary
kinship practices
and we can look
at the number of centuries
that that part of Europe
was under the church
based on the diffuse
so we have a database
of the diffusion
of bishoprics
and there's a clear
connection between
the intensive kinship practices
and the number of years
under the church
and then if you think
about like what the church
basically did
I think your work
is often used to justify
this idea of
Chesterton's fence
where if you don't
necessarily understand
a cultural practice
you should keep it around
because I mean
the stuff we were talking
about the secret
where you don't understand
why the ten steps
lead to the bean
being edible
but you know
you should trust
the sort of wisdom
of the ages
if you think about
what the church did here
right
like isn't this
sort of like
not necessarily a justification
but at least an example
of just like
breaking down
Chesterton's fence
the church doesn't
really understand
why these kin-based
networks that have
existed for thousands
of years
might have utility
it still just gets
rid of all of them
and that results
in this lottery ticket
that leads to
the great divergence
so is there evidence
for anti-chestersen's fence
from the weirdest people
sure sure
so I mean
that all
what you're talking about
is just the idea
that culture
has imbued institutions
and various practices
with a logic
that we might not understand
so it's not calling
for never changing
the institutions
it's saying
make sure you figure out
the logic
and the costs
and benefits
so I've been
I was an expert witness
in Canada
for the
Attorney General
of British Columbia
asked the Supreme Court
of British Columbia
whether the
statutes against
polygyny were legal
and so
my job
is just to inform
the court
that polygyny
has this
unfortunate effect
of the elite
and high status males
tend to get
a disproportionate
share of the wives
and that creates
this pool of low status
unmarried men
now you can decide
what you want to do
with that
but you need to understand
the kind of
underlying social dynamics
that you're going to unleash
if you
if you
you know
legalize
or decriminalize
polygyny
right
but again
like going back
to the church
like the church
didn't understand
the sort of like
positive or negative
effects they're going to have
right
they're just like
let's rip the band-aid
let's see what happens
that's right
and it actually
benefited the church
because it released
people's responsibilities
to their families
and allowed them
to migrate in
and join the church
and more heavily
invest in the church
and these later
prohibitions against
priests marrying
and stuff
was all an effort
to get greater
investment in the church
because you weren't
torn between
you know
helping your son
and then investing
in the church
and then
was that end result
which benefited the church
was that their
conscious intention
in breaking apart
these kin-based ties
or was that just
the accident
or byproduct
yeah I mean
in the record
I've never been able
to find much evidence
that they were thinking
about the destruction
of kinship ties
there is a great quote
from St. Augustine
where he talks about
the benefits of
forcing people to marry
more distantly
but you know
this is something
that was debated
repeatedly in church
councils all across Europe
and yeah
it doesn't seem
to pop up
very often
and
the church
doing this
and you know
just like
I mean for obviously
like selfish reasons
was that
was that
in any way
related to
why the church
spread
through Europe
in the first place
or
did it end up
spreading for
separate reasons
and it won out
over the other
potential religious
competitors
for separate reasons
and then
this
it did
you know
basically
was this part
of the selective mechanism
which allowed
the catholic church
to become dominant
in Europe
in the first place
I think so
although
it's hard to
it's hard to know
there was a lot
of randomness
going on
in the diffusion
of the church
but also
as the church arrived
these places
over a period
of time
became more successful
so you can see
rising urbanization
in the wake
of the church's
arrival
that would have
meant more trade
there were
citizens rights
began developing
because they were
trying to attract
citizens to the towns
that would have
given the church
more cachet
ability to move
there's also
the appearance
of these
voluntary associations
which are new
kinds of monasteries
and so the monasteries
begin spreading
throughout Europe
but they're all
linked in a network
because like
the Cistercians
they're all connected
and they have
big meetings
so they're actually
spreading a lot
of knowledge
around Europe
as well
so that's part
of this kind
of collective brain
story
and if you compare
what's happening
in Europe
at this time
to the rest
of the world
so starting
with China
you know
in 1500
the population
of England
where a couple
centuries later
the industrial revolution
starts
is 3 million
and then in Ming
dynasty China
it's somewhere
between 100 million
to 160 million
and if we take
your previous
perspective
of the size
of the collective
brain really matters
a lot
the size of the
collective brain
in China
just seems like
so much bigger
so what is the
best way to understand
what went wrong here
why weren't they
able to use their
right
so when you're
thinking about China
the first thing
to remember
is that
for a lot
of the history
we can actually
see that size
difference
mattering a lot
so a lot
of European
invention
or a lot
of stuff
used in Europe
is flowing
in gunpowder
paper
printing press
stuff
is flowing
into Europe
and so
okay
so then
what happens
after about
1000 CE
well the argument
is that
the destruction
of the kinship
group
opens the floodgates
to people
moving around
so a recent
analysis
that we've done
is
after a bishopric
arrives at
a 1.5
by 1.5
grid cell
in Europe
people begin
flowing in and out
of that grid cell
more
and what we do
to calculate that
is we have a big
database of a few
million famous people
and we have birth
and death locations
so we find out
that the church arrives
and suddenly people
are free to move around
so you have a flow
of individuals around
and you have
rising urbanization
so Europe passes
China around 1200
in the percentage
of the population
that lives in cities
and cities are where
a lot of the action
is cities and towns
and you have
the diversification
of occupations
so normally
clans would specialize
in different crafts
and you'd learn
from your clan brothers
and clan fathers
how to do the occupation
in Europe
you get guilds
and you get masters
and apprenticeships
developing
where strangers
will become
an apprentice
to a master
learn from him
move somewhere else
as a journeyman
learn from that master
and then eventually
set up a separate shop
lots of opportunities
for a flow of ideas
so it has to do
with how the kinship
system transformed
the movement of people
the rising of urbanization
the nature of guilds
and then eventually
you get universities
and things like that
so it greatly intensifies
the interconnectedness
of the collective brain
and the amount
of cognitive diversity
what do we know
about India
during this period
because from what
I've read
it's sort of a history
from a sort of
perspective of like
how much written history
we have
it's kind of a black box
but we know
that there was trade
between India
and other parts
of the world
and we know
it had a big population
do we know why India
before the Mughal period
or before the British period
wasn't
yeah
what was the effect
of like not having
maybe Abrahamic gods
or the kind of
other cultural practices
India had
yeah I mean
definitely not an expert
on this one
but I mean
some of David Reich's
evidence suggests
that the caste system
is quite old
because you can actually
see it in the
genetic system
and the caste system
is not good for innovation
because you can't
you know
if you happen to be good
at another skill
but your caste doesn't
do that skill
you can't switch over
yeah
so it's going to prevent
the sort of availability
using the genetic diversity
complex families
intensive kinship
there's reason to think
that those things
were all important
yeah
so patchwork apologies
yeah
but there was lots
of interesting ideas
actually that are developed
in India
and they move into
Central Asia
eventually end up
in the Islamic world
and then get into Europe
so for example
Arabic numbers
are actually Indian numbers
right
zero was probably developed
I mean Indians
were huge with numbers
it's kind of interesting
yeah
perhaps related
to the religion
not that this would be
a justification
for the caste system
but is there any
is there any way
in which the specialization
it engendered
would be good
from the perspective
of this collective brain
perspective
yeah
so specialization
is good
and so the interesting
thing about most
human societies
is specialization
automatic
well not automatically
it tends to evolve
along some kind
of kinship line
so in Oceania
there were different clans
in each clan
there'd be like
a canoe building clan
and a warrior clan
so that allows specialization
but it doesn't allow you
to harness the genetic diversity
because it's not like
the canoe building clan
had special canoe building genes
it's just that you
would pass down
this cultural knowledge
now a better system
but it seems hard
to evolve
is one in which
we all opt
select into
occupations in which
we think we're good at
but for that world
to exist
you need a world
of voluntary associations
with emphasis
on the individual
rather than on the group
so this is the world
that evolves in Europe
once you demolish
the intensive kinship units
because otherwise
you're going to get
castes and clans
and all these things
we see elsewhere
where we see
a division of labor
but it's transmitted
through a kin network
the knowledge
and why wasn't there
another sort of
stultifying
because we began
the conversation
by talking about
there does seem
to be this cycle
where over time
because of cultural
differences
because of kin
whatever else
over time
groups will tend
to diverge
languages
culture
other things you mentioned
tend to diverge
over time
why didn't the same
thing happen in Europe
where let's say
in the 3rd century
or 5th century
the church starts
doing this stuff
and then by a thousand
years later
you know if you're
like part of this
guild or whatever
now that's become
like the new kin
and now there's
actually less
mobility again
well so there was
a lingua franca
latin
and so intellectuals
would all write
and communicate
in latin
for a long time
so even though
they were speaking
different dialects
of french and german
and what not
they were able
to communicate
in latin
and christendom
basically formed
an overarching network
that helped
and one of the key
things that this
world religion does
and other world
religions do it too
is you have to
marry other christians
but it dissolves
the tribal line
so Europe has tons
of tribes
in the pre-christian
world
but because of
how you have to
marry other christians
you had you know
celtics marrying
franks
and in fact
the early arrival
of christianity
into england
is when a frankish
princess is marrying
an anglo
an angle
in kent
and so you know
they're marrying
back and forth
and this is going
to dissolve the tribes
because intermarriage
what's the kid
you know
so that's how
you get rid
of the tribes
but you need
a world religion
to do that
right
and so it seems
like there were
two very important
features that were
relevant here
one it seems like
well obviously
the competition
between different
european groups
which gave incentive
for monasteries
or universities
or cities
to attract the best
people
and make all
these advancements
but secondly
the fact
the fact
that they
were descended
from a common
empire
from the roman
empire
basically in a world
where like the roman
empire never existed
do you still have
this collective brain
in europe emerge
yeah no so i think
the roman empire
plays a big role
uh because for example
there were roman roads
in parts of europe
which allow people
to flow
and you have
communities which
were part of rome
and relatively
sophisticated
now they go
into a bit
of decline
but there's still
the memory
of the empire
so you know
charlemagne wants
to be crowned
emperor of the
holy roman empire
in 800
even though there's
you know
not very much
left of it
but it was still
you know
an ideal
and that carolingian
empire actually
had real effects
because they worked
with the pope
in order to
enforce a lot
of the marriage
and family program
and the carolingians
had their own agenda
because they were
trying to use
these marriage
and family practices
to weaken some
of the other
aristocratic families
but they had
the religious tools
that they could
put to work
and if you didn't
have those religious
beliefs then you
couldn't put them
to work
and what's your
take on
sometimes people
defend ancient
conquerors
based on like
a similar idea
of like
they spread
different
they spread
knowledge
around the world
and they set up
these lines
of communication
people say that
about Alexander
and then like
causing Hellenistic
expansion
and trade
and so forth
they say that
about Genghis Khan
and the Silk Road
they say
I mean obviously
that's led to
the Black Plague
so it's a tough
word that nets out
they say that
about Napoleon
and the Napoleonic
codes
and so forth
where do you
basically come out
on that story
of like actually
this sort of
like
yeah
have the great
conquerors
been good
for the collective
brain
or bad
for the collective
brain
well I've never
actually focused
on that
I mean I guess
my immediate
reaction was
there must be
a better way
to transmit
the knowledge
than the whole
conquest
and so
and then I guess
there's also
the open question
of how
the disruptions
that are caused
by them
right
how much
did they set
back the
population decline
spreading disease
and stuff
so certainly
it could have
been done better
right
and going back
to David Reich's
work
if we do see
if your theory
implies that there
should have been
a decrease
in genetic
similarity
in Europe
as a
after you know
the 5th century
or something
as a result
of the culture
the church's
practices
do we see that
in the genetic
record
yeah
yeah
so Europeans
are quite well
mixed compared
to other populations
and so we were
talking about India
you know
if you do
a principal
components analysis
so there's two
dimensional plot
of the genetic
similarity
you can actually
see the class
and people are
pretty spread out
if you do
put the Europeans
on the same plot
they're you know
they're well mixed
right
but what about
do we see the
period of greatest
mixing starting
in the 5th century
yeah good question
I don't know
the answer to that
question
so that would be
that's a nice
piece of evidence
so you know
there's a couple
of groups working
on medieval
ancient DNA
so hopefully
we'll have more
answers on that
question
I mean there is
enough now
for a pre-Roman
burial
so Bronze Age
type stuff
showing that
you know
early Europeans
definitely had
complex intensive
kin groups
patrilineal
patrilocal residents
that kind of stuff
polygyny
and then stepping back
you know
I've read
there's so many
different theories
of the Industrial
Revolution
and of modernity
and you know
there's like
Robert Allen
and the economic
historian who thinks
it's a result
of higher wages
because of the
black death
there's Gregory Clark
who thinks it's
because of this
positive eugenics
in England
where the upper
classes were having
more babies
I mean you just
go like there's
like you know
20, 30
probably hundreds
of different theories
of why it happened
where it happened
and when it happened
and so
each one of these
when I read them
sounds plausible
I don't have a
knockdown argument
against any of them
but I'm not sure
how to think about
which one is correct
and so
yeah
if we're stacking
all of these
up against each other
why I think
this story
is any more accurate
than any other story
that people tell
is it over determined
well I mean
the first thing
to think about
is those
other authors
I mean possibly
Greg Clark
is an exception
but they don't think
about the psychological
variation that exists
so there's good reason
to think
there's all these
psychological differences
and you have to believe
they don't cash out
and if you think
they exist
then you have to
explain them
and so you need
a theory that explains
them
so Bob Allen
has I mean
he's a blank
he's a blank
on the psychological
variation
so let me give you
some evidence
that I think
is some pretty
good evidence
so we have a database
of the diffusion
of Roman bishoprics
through Europe
and then what we do
is we look at
what happens
when a bishopric arrives
and I mentioned before
you get a flow of people
but another fact is
if you look at
the production
of famous people
these places
where the bishopric
has arrived
start producing
more creative individuals
relative to non-creatives
so there's an uptick
and it keeps going up
for centuries
so the relative increase
and so that suggests
you're producing
more authors
and inventors
and writers
and whatnot
and then if you take
each of those
and you look at
you correlate it
with modern patents
places that spent
more time
under the church
produce more patents
between 1980
and 2014
based on European patent data
and this holds
if you just compare regions
within the same country
so you can see
long-term effects
of this
and you can see
immediate effects
in the historical record
on the production
of creatives
and then
so what would you make
of a theory
that says like
all of these theories
are basically correct
all of these stories
are basically correct
and it's like
it's them stacking up
that leads to
the industrial revolution
rather than
any of one of them
being the most important
proximal cause
and maybe there's like
reasons
like
there's like
I don't know
let's say like
there's 10 of these stories
and you had to stack them all off
and China had like
five of them
but they also had like
maybe independently
like three other ones
but they also had like
two stories
which go against them
or something
and it's like
no one of them
is that
proximally important
it's their combination
right
so like
I guess your theory
seems compatible
with Robert Allen's
that like
coal being cheap
and wages being high
was important
well
so he's
I mean
I guess one of the things
that I think is a mistake
is to focus
too narrowly on England
cause
I mean
England was benefiting
from ideas
that were flowing in
from France
there's a lot of great science
being done in France
and
I mean
I don't think Gregory Clark's right
I can explain almost everything
he explains
with cultural evolution
and he doesn't even really
take that seriously
oh interesting
yeah
so patience
so one of the things
he argues is patience
so in the
in Weird
I use the exact same data
I actually get the data
from him
to show that you have
this increase in patience
but we know that people
can culturally learn patience
and this can all be
culturally transmitted
and in this world
it leads to more success
so if you're the kind of person
who doesn't
you know
waste a lot of his money
and we begin to value
thrift and stuff
which Protestantism does
then we should expect
there to be an increase
in fewer murders
and lower interest rates
what's the reason
to think that
I mean
his main explanation
I think is genetic
right
is there some reason
to think that
that is less likely
to be as important
a factor as culture
well we know
that populations
migrants into the US
and Europe
shift their psychology
over a few generations
of being there
and we know
there's been like
natural experiments
done by economists
like Chris Blatman
where you actively try
to teach people
train them essentially
to discount
the future less
and that seems
to be culturally transmittable
so this suggests
that you know
I can't rule out
that there's been
any genetic evolution
but I can show
that culture
can operate on this
quickly and powerfully
right
I think one of his
key pieces of evidence
I don't remember
the exact numbers
on this
even the particular detail
but it was something
like
if you look at
the inheritance
of wealth
or titles
or I forget
what the exact thing is
the sort of like
correlation
across generations
points to
the kind of pattern
you would see
with genetic inheritance
rather than
cultural spreading
yeah
he doesn't actually
fit any cultural
evolutionary models
and if you include
that people are
learning from parents
and learning from
their social milieu
your parents determine
where you are
in the social milieu
so you're surrounded
by people
who are being more
patient
and behaving
in certain economic ways
and that's going to
have a huge effect
I just told you about
how if you grow up
in Silicon Valley
you're going to
patent in computers
it's not because
you have genes
for computers
yeah
given the persistence
of these cultural effects
how should that change
how we think about
whether it makes sense
to have more immigration
from societies
that are already weird
or whether that matters
or not
right
so we just
we have a paper
under review right now
in which we show
that from
the 1850 roughly
to 1940
a big driver
of US innovation
both the quality
and quantity of patents
is the cultural diversity
of counties
and we actually use immigration
as a kind of way
of showing
the causal effect of this
so what you want
is a lot of cultural variation
now if you get people
from societies
that are more distant
from whatever
the current US culture
is at the time
it's going to take
more time
until they're able
to fully integrate
so if they're coming
from a very distrusting society
they're not going to be able
to latch into
the collective brain
immediately
so you see this
in early
around 1900
there's data
from people
mostly coming
from southern Italy
and coming from Germany
and Britain
and the southern Italians
are coming from a society
that has a high distrust
of strangers
so their immediate effect
on the patenting system
is low
but
the strength
of these cultural traits
seems to go down
by an order of magnitude
each generation
so the second generation
you can still see
where they came from
but they're a lot
more like
the majority culture
than their parents
and then it goes
down another
order of magnitude
so
yeah
so you just have
to do more work
essentially
to assimilate people
and culturate them
but the potential value
of having
diverse ways
of thinking
different ideas
can be really valuable
I think
what do you make
of Gerard Jones
so Gerard Jones
is an economist
who has this
he calls this
spaghetti theory
of assimilation
I don't know
if you've heard of this
the idea is basically
like look
immigrants do assimilate
but they also assimilate us
and so whatever
cultural practices
they have
will
in proportion
to their size
of the population
have an effect
on
wherever they migrate to
and his example
is like
when Italians
came to America
spaghetti
which is like
traditionally
an Italian dish
also became
an American dish
right
so they assimilated
American culture
as well
and make
you know
sub in like
traits like
trust or whatever
there
basically
this like
sort of
reciprocal
assimilation
has implications
of whether
we want
immigration
from
non-reward societies
what do you make
of that idea
so
I mean
I think
that the
spaghetti example
is
or the pizza
pizza or spaghetti
both good examples
is a great thing
right
because
I mean
American food
is a fusion
of like
cuisine
from lots
of societies
and that leads
to quite good food
same thing
you can see
music
so
things like
jazz
come
have African
rhythms in them
and so
rock and roll
you know
is along
that lineage
but we don't want
like
do we want
the diversity
in low trust
and high trust
well
but
the question
is
do social
interactional
traits
operate the
same way
as these
things
and
if you have
ethnic
enclaves
then you're
going to get
low trust
in those
ethnic
enclaves
you get
things like
the mafia
right
so you don't
want that
but if you
had an
immigration
policy
that
distributed
people
and in
a high trust
society
you benefit
by being
higher trust
because you
can do things
like collaborate
and you know
start companies
and stuff
which you have
to be high trust
to do that
otherwise you
don't do it
in a very
effective way
so there is
a pressure
to for
low trust
people to
become more
high trust
but if you're
in mostly
high trust
people
there's not
an incentive
for you
to move
down
so in
social
interactional
traits
are different
than
things like
food types
yeah
in psychology
there's been
this problem
of the
replication
crisis
where a lot
of the main
results
are hard
to re-replicate
and it's not
clear how much
of this is real
science
have you
looked into
how many
of the
results
the weird
results
are based
on
of the
differences
in psychology
between different
populations
and so forth
how much
of that
actually
replicates
yeah
I mean
my sense
is it
replicates
quite well
so you know
we published
our paper
in 2010
and in
late 20
aughts
Armin Falk
is an economist
and a bunch
of others
Achenbecker
Ben Anki
published a paper
where they
measured economic
preferences
in 80,000
people
around the
world
and that
just showed
big variation
in things
like patience
various kinds
of reciprocity
altruism
so the kinds
of things
we would expect
so and then
other large scale
projects have
similarly shown
lots of variation
the groups
we have today
which are not
weird
when you study
them
do you think
that the fact
that they have
resisted modernity
for so long
suggests that they
actually are weird
in their own way
which is to say
that like
this is not
representative
of the way
that Europeans
might have been
thinking in the
second century
rather it's like
the Hasda's
particular weirdness
leads them to be
averse to
modernity
in a way
that is unique
well that's always
a concern
and it's especially
a concern
when you're
studying hunter
gatherers
because a lot
of the hunter
gatherers
that are left
in the world
today are
places where
agriculturalists
couldn't easily
move to
so that you know
that's something
we're thinking
about all the time
the ways around
that are to go
to places
where agriculturalists
didn't go
or couldn't go
so we have a lot
of good ethnographic
history on
people in Australia
and then we have
the arctic
populations
which you know
big sections
of paleolithic
Europe
were probably
kind of like
northern Canada
is today
so at least
environmentally
it's not a crazy
because you know
ice age Europe
and places
like the Aleutian
Islands
the west coast
of California
we have lots
of ethnographic evidence
and there was
no agriculture
there
so yeah
so just putting
together all these
different lines
of evidence
help us develop
a picture
I wouldn't want
to bank everything
on the Hadza
of course we can't
do experiments
with some of those
groups
but we can see
whether the Hadza
look like these
other hunter-gatherer
groups
okay speaking of
the ice age
do you have a take
on why before
the ice age
agriculture didn't
develop even though
genetically there
probably weren't
that big a difference
between like 20,000
years ago
versus 10,000
years ago
yeah I don't have
a clear picture
of that
it is the case
that the Holocene
was a particularly
long stretch
a particularly
long interglacial
there were some
long interglacials
but the soonest
one before that
was 120,000
years ago
other than that
they were getting
broken up
I sometimes wonder
if we may
someday figure out
that there were
actually a little
bit of agriculture
and it would have
all been destroyed
by the ice age
right so it's not
clear that there
would be any
heritage of it
left
so we would have
to find some
remnants of some
domesticated crops
although I was
asking David Reich
about this
and I forget
the reason he said
but he did say
that if there were
societies before
the ice age
we would have
evidence of them
in the archaeological
record or the
genetic record
or something like that
yeah if they had
gotten to any scale
but we know
from modern societies
there are groups
for example in the
Amazon that have
root-based agriculture
that wouldn't leave
any archaeological record
this is a question
I also asked
David Reich
there's
you know
with modern LLMs
and just generally
with newer techniques
for processing information
and understanding evidence
there's a potential
for answering questions
that maybe we couldn't
have done before
especially from maybe
a cultural perspective
where you can actually
consider lots of
different cultural artifacts
at once
in the context of
you can like run
cultural simulations
or something
maybe those are
more fanciful ideas
but maybe there's
more practical ideas
but if there's sort of
like one question
you have
which
it's sort of
bottlenecked
by having the right data
or being able to
process the data
the right way
and future LLMs
or AIs
could help us there
does something
immediately come to mind?
Well
this gives me a chance
to tell you
something we've been
working on
so we were talking
about this
the kinship hypothesis
the idea that
kinship intensity
affects psychology
and when I presented
the ideas that are
in the weirdest people
in the world
I get hard times
sometimes from historians
who will have
some kind of
very European
specific story
about why this happened
that has to do
with European royalty
or coal
or something like that
and so my move
is to you know
not try to get
into the weeds
and start reading
Latin text
but to go test
it somewhere else
so if it's true
that kinship intensity
should work like this
then we should be able
to test it somewhere else
so we have
a large corpus
two different corpus
from China
and so we have
late imperial China
something called
the gazetteers
which were produced
across the prefectures
and they had
a stylized content
so this is the same genre
thousands of books
and then we have
about 7,000 books
going back 2,000 years
in Chinese history
and the techniques
that the AI
is allowing us to do
is to get measurements
of psychology
from the texts
so we take
a questionnaire
this is a technique
developed by my postdoc
Muhammad Atari
we take a psychological
questionnaire
that's been validated
it's in English
and we want to get
an equivalent
in ancient Chinese
so we run it
through
a kind of
semantic similarity
comparison
and we look for
quotes
from the ancient
Chinese corpora
that match
each sentence
in the English corpora
and then we rebuild
the questionnaire
in ancient Chinese
so that's our
psychological measure
for something like
individualism
or collectivism
or moral universalism
and then we take
each book
or each paragraph
in each book
and we do
a comparison
cosine similarity
comparison
between the two
sets of text there
and that allows us
to stamp each paragraph
with a measure
of individualism
for example
and then we do that
for the entire corpora
and this allows us
to track psychological
change across space
and time in China
and then we can correlate
that with kinship intensity
and we get the same
correlations that we do
in Europe
interesting
how worried are you
about the fact
that
if you think about
modernity was a result
of finding this one
very cultural variant
at least according
to your story
which then
helps us develop
better technologies
all these new institutions
and so forth
how worried are you
about the fact
that the modern world
because of the spread
of weird
has just much less
cultural variants
and because of this
monoculture
a potential variant
which might be useful
in the next transition
just wouldn't emerge
yeah I am worried
about that
because just the destruction
of languages
so we're losing languages
left and right
English is a particular form
that you don't find
in lots of languages
so that's
you know
that's just an example
of the kind of
cultural diversity
we're losing
yeah so that's
definitely a worry
I do think that
we're getting new variants
so if you look at
so Japan adopts
a lot of weird institutions
but it's really creating
a new third unique thing
it's got a bunch
of weird elements
but you know
Japanese law
despite being the same
as the US
operates very differently
so unlike Americans
Japanese don't tend
to sue each other
and they tend to use
mediation and things
like that
even though the
superficial law
is pretty similar
so I do think
there is creation
of novelty
which could be useful
but yeah in general
I worry about
the loss of novelty
yeah and
I also should say
that I think
that the
sort of impersonal
world of impersonal
institutions
and weird psychology
is quite fragile
so for example
in the US
in rural areas
you see moral
universality declining
over the last
since 2008
this is based
on John Heights
yourmorals.org data
and so
there's an increasing
difference in the
morality of urban areas
versus rural areas
in the US
I'm sure you get asked
about this a lot
but fertility seems
to be declining
around the world
and there doesn't seem
to be any existing
cultural variants
other than maybe
the Amish
who can resist it
do you have takes
from a sort of
cultural anthropologist
perspective of what's
happening here
and a follow-on
question here is
should we
should we really
encourage these
cultural enclaves
like the Amish
to the extent
that this like
anti-fertility meme
is so viral
that like
they can't be part
of the common culture
and still preserve
fertility
you really need
this like
closed off societies
in order to preserve
fertility
how seriously
do you take that idea?
well I do
I definitely take
declining fertility
pretty seriously
because especially
if you're like
a collective brain
guy like me
just having fewer
people
it's going to be
a big problem
and I think
that there will be
spread of ideologies
or religions
or something
which are pro-natalist
and those groups
will have a big
advantage in cultural
evolution
because a community
that is pro-natalist
tends to produce
more pro-natalist
babies
and so
I mean that's
Christianity spread
using that
Mormonism spread
in the 19th century
using that trick
so
I just feel like
where cultural evolution
is going to find
the combination
and there's going to be
some pro-natalist
groups spreading
there are a lot
of different societies
in the world today
and
is there some
explanation of why
like none of them
have the existing
variants
necessary to keep
fertility high?
well I mean
from a cultural
evolutionary perspective
this is
relatively new
right
so the demographic
transition is only
really like
late 19th century
lots of the world
is just getting hit
after 1970
and we also have
things like
rising female
labor force
participation
which is going
to stifle it
rising female
education
and so once
that stuff
you know
maxes out
then we'll
you know
there'll be
you'll see
variation among
different groups
in terms of
the number of
babies they produce
right
so
and this thing
unfolds in
demographic time scale
so
we're not going
to see it
for a few
generations
but there'll be
there'll be
some group
somewhere
that will be
producing more
babies than
everybody else
and the reason
why I think
religion is the
likely one
is because
you know
people might
people do things
because they
think God
wants to do it
and if people
come to think
that God
wants them
to have more
babies
because it's
a way of
worshiping him
or getting to
heaven
or whatever
the religious
configuration is
then that'll
be a group
that produces
more babies
I mean
Catholics
were defying
the demographic
transition for a
while
they just
seem to have
stopped
right
how worried
are you
about the fact
that I mean
you discuss
in weird
that throughout
this period
in human
European history
European states
are at war
most of the time
how worried
are you about
the fact
that because
of a decline
in war
between great
powers
that you know
this like build
up in sort of
cultural mutational
load that you
were talking
about or maybe
where things
just get less
efficient over
time and there's
no selective
pressure to get
rid of that
inefficiency
how worried
are you about
that just
making governments
or nations
less efficient
over time
because there's
like there's
no sort of
like outer loop
loss function
that says
like if you
mess up enough
your country
might not exist
or your group
might not exist
which you were
talking about
the waves
of Yamnaya
or the
Anatolian
hunter-gatherers
just like
conquering everything
if that doesn't
happen
will we just
see culture
and nations
and governments
degrade over time
yeah
so I think
the answer
to that
is yes
the one way
that countries
or whatever
the political
institution is
could address
that would be
doing this
thing that I've
variously called
like domesticating
the competition
yeah
so sports teams
constantly renew
themselves by
competing
firms live and die
and renew themselves
over time
like you said
companies will start
off being super great
and then they get
too big
and then they get
kind of inefficient
and then eventually
they disappear
yeah
none of them
last forever
and that seems
to be true
of political units
but in principle
you could have
at least some
renewal processes
so democracy
potentially provides
a renewal process
although there are
things like
the institutions
that the government
builds that are
hard to renew
so like one simple
political idea
is I think
when you create
a new department
it should have
the same thing
that cells have
where at a certain
time they time out
and you got to
make a new one
yeah
and that's because
just the way
human bureaucracies
institutions work
is they kind of
corrode from the interior
from the inside
just the way
cancer spreads
in a cell
so you just got
to kill it
and make a new one
so we could
institute that
but I guess
the idea
hasn't quite
caught on yet
I mean there are
bits and pieces
of it around
so it's not
like it's unused
yeah I mean I guess
maybe the thing
that's like
less understood
or is not
appreciated
is that
the reason that
over time
in history
institutions have
improved
is because of
the selective process
that at least
at certain levels
of selection
no longer exists
yeah
I mean you know
the Roman Empire
didn't say
you know we got
to redo everything
why not adapt democracy
and we could have
a republic
you know
just nobody does that
right
things fall apart
yeah
the researcher
Stuart Armstrong
has this idea
called Chesterton's
Metafence
and here's what
it states
in our current
system
democratic market
economies
with large governments
the common practice
of taking down
Chesterton's fences
is a process
which seems
well established
and has a decent
track record
and should not
be unduly
interfered with
can you say
any more
about what
the author
has in mind
I would like
an example
yes
so I think
this is a rebuttal
against this
common idea
that
we shouldn't
you know
like
we shouldn't
be arbitrarily
like
suppose a new
technology comes
about
and we're
worried about
the risk
it might pose
to society
suppose
some
the young
kids are doing
something different
culturally
and we're
worried about
what effect
that might
have on
the culture
and so forth
he's basically
saying I think
look this has
been happening
for five centuries
and
this process
by which
new cultural
variants enter
the mix
and so forth
has worked
really well
for us
even if it's
happened at a
rapid clip
and we shouldn't
interfere with it
well I don't
think I have
strong feelings
on this
I mean I'm
I'm always
focused on
trying to
understand the
process of
cultural evolution
and it is true
that people
often resist
cultural change
that in retrospect
we think is good
but of course
when you know
you begin to
make cities
you led to
all kinds
of epidemic
diseases
so if you
had anticipated
that you might
have worked
on some of
the public
health procedures
before you
built the cities
right
so foresight
can be good
right
I guess
the sort of
bigger question
here is
it makes sense
in the kind
of environment
our ancestors
faced
why they'd
have intuitions
against progress
because if you
already have
technologies
that are well
fit to the
environment
any change
is likely
to be deleterious
and whether
we find ourselves
in a world
that's different
enough
where we can
just like
very intentionally
disregard
our worries
about changes
in culture
or technology
or whether
it's similar
enough
that we should
actually like
I mean
there's like
two ways
you're going
to interpret
the secret
right
one is like
oh look
this is why
we should care
more about
culture
and so forth
another is just
like oh wow
they're living
in such a
different world
like I understand
why my intuition
against progress
where it comes
from
and now I can
totally disregard
it
right
so I would say
that the lesson
from secret
is not to
disregard it
but just to
be cautious
because we could
be dismantling
things that are
really important
for the structure
of society
and you shouldn't
do that
you shouldn't
just dismiss
valuable cultural
practices
as you know
the relics
of a medieval
age
or the relics
of a pre-enlightened
age
or something
like that
so ritual
is a good
example
because rituals
seem to have
real psychological
benefits
and binding
people in community
and helping
develop self-regulation
but it's easy
to be an atheist
like me
and say
our rituals
are stupid
we got to
stop doing them
it turns out
they're doing
a bunch of stuff
and if you don't
want to lose
that stuff
you've got to
figure out
another solution
yeah
a question that
arises in my head
is look
we began this
conversation
talking about
all these societies
in the past
even when they
figured out
something successful
they did not
themselves know
why it was
successful
and so they just
had to ascribe
it to custom
they just say
like oh this is
the way we always
made bows
or hunted
or something
why do you think
that we have
an answer
for why the
industrial revolution
happened
why do you think
it's any different
than the Inuit
trying to explain
why they make
their bows
a certain way
oh you mean
how or what
we're up to
is different
yeah
well I mean
we're trying
to apply science
which has been
very successful
in all these
different areas
yeah
so you know
evidence
and we all
put out our
arguments
and we go
through the
process
and some
evidence
is better
than others
and you know
that's our
epistemology
right
right
and I do
think you know
I'm interested
in the cultural
evolution
of epistemologies
so societies
have varied
over time
in what counts
as good evidence
and what counts
as a good argument
so one of the
psychological changes
that we see
emerging in Europe
compared to other
places
is how much
how important
is what the
ancients say
so in lots of
societies
you're really
if someone says
something
and you can say
Aristotle or
Confucius
didn't believe that
then it's like
oh gosh
I guess I'm sunk
whereas at some
point Europeans
decided actually
who cares what
Aristotle thought
we know a lot
more than he did
so this is a big
epistemological change
and then the emphasis
on empirical evidence
in science
is not something
you find in earlier
traditions within Europe
and it's quite variable
across different societies
so you should think
of the very standards
by which we count
a good argument
and good evidence
is itself culturally evolved
yeah
and how much
do you worry about
the lack of cultural
variation
in science in particular
where
look we have
like one big institution
the NIH
which funds
most science
and there's similar
processes
of consensus
and a peer review
and whatever
that educated
whether you get a grant
whether work is accepted
whether it's considered
for
considered worthy scholarship
and so forth
should we think
that maybe we should
have more variation
in those methods
because maybe
like the scientific method
isn't complete
there's
epistemic tools
could be improved
or could be different
and so forth
yeah absolutely
so polycentricity
there should be
lots of different
competition amongst
these groups
no single funding sources
lots of different priorities
one thing I point out
in this book
I'm working on
is that
scientific papers
tend to be more
impactful
when the authors
are more
from more diverse societies
but interestingly
people are biased
to work with people
from their own society
so what we actually do
is different
than what would
maximize innovation
yep
I'm sure you're going
to address this
in the book
but I'm already
curious now
it seems like
the internet
hasn't been
as big a deal
as somebody
who's thinking
from this
zoomed out
collective brain picture
might have anticipated
in the 90s
maybe it's boosted
the rate of innovation
somewhat
although it's not clear
just looking at
growth rates
or productivity
growth rates
or something
that it has
why didn't
the internet
just like cause
this
the equivalent
of another round
of urbanization
in our ability
to do research
or economic productivity
or so forth
yeah
that's something
I'm really interested
in figuring out
and one thing
that is
I'm still
I don't have
a full answer
to this question
but one thing
that is clear
is that
there's something
special about
face-to-face
interactions
so something like
whether even
in the 21st century
whether two cities
have direct
long-haul flights
between them
or direct flights
between them
increases the flow
of ideas
between those places
but we know
these places
are connected
by the internet
whereas that effect
doesn't seem as good
and part of this
is that people
have to build trust
probably
before we start
sharing ideas
and we're more likely
and the more
different someone
is from us
the more you need
that trust
so some of the research
suggests that this effect
is even bigger
when places are more
culturally different
and this is interesting
because they're probably
more valuable to each other
when they're more
culturally different
but that's then
the face time
and being in the same place
is even more valuable
so that's the kind of
direction I'm going
and I also
I'm not satisfied
that I still think
that there should be
exactly what you said
which is that
the internet should have
caused more innovation
I'm just not satisfied
that we fully
determined the best way
to figure that out
yeah
you had a very interesting
chapter in weird
where you talk about
a lot of innovation
through history
is more serendipitous
than we imagine
and it's a result
of the collective brain
being big enough
to discover these things
but if you look at
the sort of track record
in science and research
there do seem to be
certain individuals
who make independent
discoveries across
many different fields
that are each
quite important
your Newtons
and Einsteins
and John von Neumann
and so forth
and if it was just
the result of
the right person
is in the right lab
who sees the right
observation
at the right time
this repeated excellence
by certain people
seems less explainable
so I'm curious
if the collective brain's
theory can explain
what's going on there
right
so I mean
I definitely
sometimes I'm interpreted
as saying that
there are no
like genetic differences
among individuals
definitely think
there are genetic differences
among individuals
that affect their likelihood
but I think
when we take
the individual
we often import
into our thinking
about them
the person's life history
so for example
Einstein
when he was a patent clerk
so he wasn't succeeding
as an academic
he and his friends
got together
in something called
the Olympian Academy
they called themselves
which was just a group
of like five people
who would get together
and they would read
the interesting books
at the time
and if you look
at the books
that they read
and historians have done
a lot of work on this
all the major ideas
that go into special relativity
were read and processed
by the Olympia Academy
before they do it
so the idea that
you know people think
that time is relative
well people were kind of
talking about that
and they were talking
about multiple dimensions
and like Henri Poincaré
at the same time
comes up with the same
equation as Einstein
but he doesn't give it
as radical an interpretation
as Einstein does
he was thinking
of the equations
as kind of fudge factors
trying to make the math work
so there was
an almost simultaneous
invention of special relativity
and the ideas
were all circulating
and Einstein happened
to be in a place
which allowed him
to put all those
things together
as a patent clerk
he was actually
processing devices
to synchronize trains
in different parts
of Europe
and so he had to think
about the amount
of time a signal
coming from different
parts of the world
and there was a bunch
of these
and you know
we know the patents
that went through
and we know
that he had to look
at these
there was only two guys
so he happened
to be in a particular
place in time
in terms of the ideas
circulating
and what he was doing
on a day-to-day basis
that really did give him
an edge
now you could then say
well what about
general relativity
well there was a couple
other guys who were
probably going to get
general relativity
and Einstein himself
was worried that he was
going to get scooped
because once you get
the one
it's just a matter
of figuring
I mean it's just
a matter of figuring
out the math
the math is really hard
but there were
a number of other people
who probably would have
gotten the math
yes I guess
then there's also
still the question
of why in 1905
Einstein himself
discovers not only
special relativity
but Brownian motion
and what was the
other two other things
right
but I guess you would
just say it's the result
of he had the right
reading group
well I guess
with the point
I mean obviously
he's a special individual
although there's a
he did spend
the whole second half
of his career
trying to show
why quantum mechanics
was wrong
yeah
so his Brownian motion
paper is foundational
in quantum mechanics
but then he decides
you know God
doesn't play dice
with the universe
and he doesn't like
the stochastic nature
of quantum mechanics
which is you know
more or less
proved true
and it's part of
our modern technology
and stuff like that
and he's
he spends the whole
second half
of his career
fighting it
so that's a case
where his intuitions
didn't serve him well
right
and he turned out
to be wrong
for decades
sorry I think
that's also a case
in which your point
about having the right
ideas available to you
is important
because obviously
I don't know much
about this
but from what I understand
the people who believe
in the many worlds
interpretation
believe that Einstein
was on the right track
and he just didn't have
this idea
of the Everett
multiverse
available to him
which would have
explained his
that were there's
this branching thing
it's just a matter
of figuring out
which branch
right
and so there's
no probability
or there's no
yeah
okay so we were
just discussing
look Einstein
was reading
the right things
and making sure
he had enough context
to come up
with these big discoveries
you're somebody
who has connected
ideas across
many different fields
how would you
describe your
the input function
for the way
in which you come up
with new ideas
and how much
has it been informed
by I mean you were
like you started off
as an aerospace engineer
and you've done
anthropology across
so many different societies
on field work
and so forth
how do you basically
think about the
Joseph Hendrick
production function
yeah I mean
I try to implement
the ideas
of the collective brain
so in my lab
at Harvard
I have postdocs
and graduate students
with backgrounds
in evolutionary biology
psychology
anthropology
economics
I mean some of my
favorite collaborators
are economists
and we're just bringing
ideas from very
different places
but across the social
sciences
even the biological
sciences
we're often trying
to explain the same
kind of phenomena
economic decision making
cooperation
you know
things like ethnicity
why does it exist
stuff like that
so
yeah
the way we silo
science is a big problem
and especially
in the social science
I think it's even
a bigger problem
one of my experiences
so I've been a professor
of anthropology
psychology
economics
and evolutionary biology
and just even
the standards of evidence
and what constitutes
good research
and how you tackle
a problem
really varies
so the academic
disciplines
are like different
cultural worlds
different tribes
and just pulling
the best from them
has kind of been
my approach
and do you
among the sort of
more polymathic
scholars
do you guys have
I don't know
do you and David
and a couple of the
other ones
like
in this category
is there like
some shared group
you guys have
or is it
yeah
no it's a series
of different networks
so David Reich
and I for example
are always talking
about how to
I mean
you know
we want to read
culture from the genes
so if humans have had
a long history
of gene culture
co-evolution
and we want to understand
what paleolithic
populations were doing
we might be able
to see imprints
of it in the genes
so in my own work
for example
we've measured
cousin marriage
across different
populations
and shown you
it correlates
with runs
of homozygosity
in the genes
something like
polygyny
can be revealed
by looking at
the ratio
the variance
in Y chromosomes
to X chromosomes
fire probably
has some
we probably have
some special
genetic adaptations
for dealing
with the toxins
in fire
so if you want
to know
when humans
got fire
and you see
the gene
that gives us
immunity
to toxins
in fire
then we can infer
that fire is older
than that
right
interesting
and
so obviously
the input
from different
scientific fields
in your work
is obvious
but from a more
philosophical perspective
people compare
your work
in the same tradition
as Burke
or Chesterton
or something
do you personally
find that your
philosophy
has been informed
by reading them
or is it just
independently
converging
on some of
the same themes
yeah
I mean
all that
any convergence
is completely
independent
because I haven't
really spent
much time
at all
I mean
I've gone back
after people said
your work
is kind of like Hayek
I went back
and read some Hayek
I did read
The Fatal Conceit
in graduate school
but aside from that
I didn't read
very much
and then same thing
with Adam Smith
I mean
I've tackled
the wealth
of nations
and I eventually
read The Theory
of Moral Sentiments
but it was pretty
far into the process
I had become
I picked up
on themes
they developed
before I knew
they had developed
them
yeah
I want to suggest
that maybe you should
add a couple of AI people
in your rotation
okay
just because I think
this perspective
actually has
is incredibly informative
what I think is
maybe the most important
question of our period
of like
what does this transition
towards
a society of AIs
look like
and
sorry to bring it back
to AI
but one other
consideration here
that your work
has really informed me on
is
I was sort of
maybe hyping up
how big a deal
I expect
societies of AIs
to be
but
something your work
informs is the idea
of like
a single super intelligence
is not the place
in which to expect
these big impacts
of
John von Neumann
times 10
the
but then again
there is a key advantage
in the scope
of social learning
they can do
as a society
but like
the idea of a single
super intelligence
being super powerful
is maybe less likely
as a result
of your work
and I
anyways
I don't know
what you think
about the interpretation
but
yeah
I think that's right
because the assumption
the sort of model
that people seem
to carry around
their heads
is that
humans have
done all these things
because of our
individual brain power
when really
it's been the power
of cultural evolution
and a network
of minds
you know
gnawing away
of problems
over long periods
of time
and gradually
accumulating
not just
the obvious tools
but also
the cognitive tools
for addressing
these things
yeah
look I
I buy the idea
that individual IQ
isn't the most
relevant factor
to understanding
why discoveries
are made
it's not about
having the right
genius or something
but what's the reason
for thinking
that the average
IQ of a society
isn't super important
in how much progress
that society's gonna make
not just the population size
right
so the first thing
that we need to do
though
is to zoom back out
and think about
what we mean by IQ
and so Michael Muthu
Krishna and I
have made the case
that IQ
is just
a set of cognitive abilities
that leads to success
in 20th century
contemporary institutions
that have come
to dominate the world
so it's a set
it's a culturally
evolved system
and we talked before
about the Flynn effect
which illustrates that
and the fact that IQ
is associated
with all these
positive outcomes now
but certainly
wouldn't be
in pastoralist societies
right
so that would mean
that you know
if you can raise
if you raise
the average IQ
of your society
it might lead them
to have more
abstract thoughts
and do better science
and so that's
that certainly fits
but the interesting
thing for me
is that
the world of the future
is going to be
quite different
than the one now
so the set
of cognitive abilities
which is going to be
favored in the new AI world
is not going to be
the same set
that was favored
in 1900
when they designed
the IQ test
so for example
you know
in the IQ test
they ask you
to remember digits backwards
I'm not sure
how useful
remembering
lists of digits backwards
it was in a previous world
where we had to
write everything down
and remember a lot of stuff
but in some sense
we're interfacing
with our technology
and we got to figure out
how do we
what are the set
of cognitive abilities
which is going to
make people
best able to solve problems
and like we talked about
it's even the case
that the most creative people
aren't the highest IQ people
right
I guess
one of the things
I'm trying to say
is that
the minds
that might lead us
into the new world
might not
might not be the ones
that have the highest IQ
because the specialized
once you're
you know
sort of augmented
with AI
and all these kind
of technological aids
we have
the specialized thing
that leads someone
to do something creative
probably not going to be
the same abilities
that did it in 1910
yeah
I guess my real opinion
is that
if in the world
where that's true
and I think that's
probably going to be true
then there's like
no sort of
then it really doesn't
matter at all
because AI
is going to be doing
everything
but in the world
where like
let's say AI plateaus
or something
then I would expect
roughly the same kinds
of skills
that have mattered
for the last couple
of centuries
to keep mattering
for a modern
technological society
which is analytical
thinking
and the ability
to understand
science and technology
and so forth
but maybe the AI world
you're imagining
is different
than the one I'm imagining
but I still think
that people are going
to figure out
what problems
we need to solve
unless we're just
going to tell the AIs
to figure out
what the problems are
and then solve them
yeah
they might not be
that good at that
I don't know
we'll see
you shared with me
this draft
of work
about collective brains
where you show
that ants
have developed
many of the
sort of
technologies
that humans
have
of almost like
farming
and livestock
and you know
division of labor
and so forth
and so
maybe there's
some amount
of
look
it's just like
blind selection
and it doesn't matter
if it's natural selection
if it's cultural selection
it's the size
of the group
which can
go through this
learning process
that matters
and how many people
are available
to experience
the learnings
or get the selection
process acted upon them
but
I guess the big difference
and where maybe
individual IQ
comes back into the picture here
is
I don't expect there
to be any amount
of natural selection
which will allow
ants to land on the moon
or make a computer chip
or do
you know
make a nuclear fusion plant
or something
and so
is the kind of
broad generalization
we see with humans
and we might see
to an even greater extent
with AI
a product of
you're really bottlenecked
by the IQ
of the individual
there's no amount
of collective learning
that can get you
to the moon
if you're an ant
right
well
one thing to keep in mind
is that most human societies
over most of human
evolutionary history
didn't get to the moon
right
so this is one particular
group of humans
and
one of the things
we talked about earlier
in this conversation
was the cultural evolution
of epistemology
so it was the improvement
in our
what constitutes evidence
what constitutes a good argument
that allows us
to get to science
and accumulate
this kind of knowledge
to do these kinds of things
so I see that
as part of the
continuous trajectory
but it's just that
we have new cognitive tools
right
I guess
but I don't imagine
a world in which
so it's a really interesting point
that even the epistemic tools
which let us get to the moon
are themselves a product
of cultural evolution
but
again
that seems bottlenecked
by the fact that
like
if
if you're like
you know
if you're like
just dealing with
chimpanzees or something
there's no amount
of cultural
evolution
that will result
in the scientific method
that
it needs some gene culture
co-evolution
right
so you mentioned
in the secret
that tool use
started something
like 2 million years ago
and fire
we started
domesticating fire
closer to
800,000
to a million years ago
intuitively
it doesn't seem like
tool use
is that like
that much simpler
than fire
but is that a misunderstanding
why was fire so much recent
well
so
what we know
from other species
is that lots of animals
use tools
and particularly chimpanzees
use tools
so we can assume tools
in the common ancestor
now what we see
in the paleoanthropological record
is the increasing use
of stone tools
yeah
and these are pretty
simple stone tools
like you can define
you can see a cutting edge there
but not very much
fancier than that
and then fire is
a lot of animals
are afraid of fire
and they have to run
from wildfires
and stuff like that
so whatever your story
about humans is
you have to overcome
the fear of the fire
in order to tame it
probably humans
first found wildfire
and somebody approached
the fire
instead of running away
which is the usual
thing to do
right
and then got some of it
and then put it to use
I guess
yeah
so
so I think it's the innate fear
that animals have of fire
which is we don't hang around
when things
right
okay
final question
what's the next thing
you're working on
well the big thing
is this book
on collective brains
so I'm gradually
working through that
one of the ideas
that I really
am excited about
in this book
is that
we evolve to think
in collectives
there's this assumption
that psychologists
have had
that understand
human decision making
and how our minds
solve problems
is that we should
put people
in by themselves
in experiments
and see how they do
but real human societies
hunter-gatherers
they actually work
in groups
and when we want
to solve a problem
the first thing
we want to do
is check with our friends
or ask other expert members
of the community
so it's the idea
that we think
collectively
and solve problems
collectively
in a kind of
naturally distributed brain
and Hugo Mercier
and Dan Sperber
for example
have argued
and shown
with various lines
of evidence
that many of the sort
of irrational biases
we have
mitigate
or disappear entirely
when we solve
problems as groups
so it's almost like
we evolve
to have that
positive interaction
and correct
each other's errors
right
that's quite interesting
that you're uncalibrated
like you care more
about the portfolio
of intelligences
than any one person
being calibrated
excellent
this is super fun
thanks so much
for coming on the podcast
great to be with you
