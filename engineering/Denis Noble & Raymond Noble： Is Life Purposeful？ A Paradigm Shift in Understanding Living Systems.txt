There's absolutely no reason why attributing purpose to organisms is non-scientific.
That's rubbish.
We are effectively saying not only are organisms purposive, and evidently so,
but very interestingly, as physiologists, we know also that a purposive explanation
actually predicts downwards towards the molecular level
as to what kinds of mechanisms must exist for that purpose to exist than the other way round.
What is interesting here is that purposive explanations actually lead to good science.
What is this doing?
Why does it consume 20% of the total energy that we use?
It's got nothing to do with whether there's something ghostly out there
that, as it were, is a goal that is somewhere out there dragging us towards something.
That sort of causation is not involved.
All it's postulating is that there is anticipation of what might happen in the future,
and that has nothing to do with backward time causation or anything ghostly like that.
All it's got to have, any organism, is the ability to anticipate very many different reactions
rapidly to crisis situations, and that can only be done by having an anticipatory process occurring inside here.
Consciousness to me is like a readiness, if you like, to act, and thereby anticipatory.
And it goes back to what Dennis was saying earlier, that the key thing there is anticipation.
It's the state of readiness and anticipating what it is that's going on in the world,
regardless of whether we're right about it.
We cannot function without that.
And that is consciousness.
That is demonstrating, isn't it?
There are what are called readiness potentials in the nervous system that have been recorded
as inevitably what happens when you are in the process of making a decision.
It's fascinating.
It really is.
They are readiness potentials.
The system is getting itself geared up.
And we feel that consciously, too.
Well, that is the feeling.
That is the consciousness, Dennis.
That is the consciousness.
But, you know, I'll say something really highly controversial now,
something that Dennis and I have been discussing more recently.
Ray, Dennis, is there anything particular you'd like me to touch on while we go through this conversation?
One of the things that I've been thinking more about in recent times, as Dennis knows,
and Dennis and I have had discussions about, and, of course, you must understand that we never have closed minds,
Dennis and I, on anything.
I mean, our whole approach is to try and be as open to ideas as possible,
because it seems to us that the only way you can begin to understand,
particularly problems like the mind-body issue, is to be open to ideas.
What we've been doing is sort of focusing on, I think it's fair to say,
on one or two areas that I think are somewhat mistaken in approach, if you like.
You may be wrong on that and correct it.
But one of those is that the idea of consciousness as an emergent phenomenon,
that it depends, as it were, on higher order functionality.
And our approach to that is more, as we've expressed in one of our papers,
in terms of a title of one of our papers, emergent.
It's just simply, actually, you can remove the word A altogether.
It's emergent.
And it's emergent through levels and across levels, if you see what I mean.
Within levels, it's emergent as well.
There's a mergence going on.
And that mergence, we feel, is something which is true of all cells.
It's as true of unicellular organisms as it is of higher level,
a horrible word, higher, more complex, more organized entities.
Multicellularity, for example, will involve some kind of coming together
of what we would normally look at in relation to individual organisms,
unicellular organisms, as what I believe you could refer to as conscious,
in the sense that it is to do with the state of being of that organism
in relation to its readiness, if you like, to respond.
And they are conditional states.
So, in a sense, consciousness is a conditional state.
And conditional states exist, although with different levels of faculty,
what has evolved as a result in large part of that motivational consciousness,
if you like, that changing of states and responsiveness,
are the different faculties that we see in all sorts of forms of life.
And life has explored different ways of being engaged with the problem
of maintaining its integrity.
So, I think that sort of encapsulates, I think, where our thoughts are.
I mean, Dennis might want to correct some points,
but I think that really sums up where we are.
But we're not closed, if you see what I mean.
I mean, one of the things that we're probably more closed about
is the idea that there is a mind-body separation, as it were.
Yes, that's another aspect that I think we think is mistaken.
And it leads to all sorts of problems of regarding organisms
as sort of mechanistic, not just material.
I don't think there's a problem in regarding it as material,
but that's different in regarding it as mechanistic.
And it was the change to looking at life as mechanistic
that I think created all the problems back in the Western sense
in terms of the Enlightenment and so on.
That for some reason, we wanted humans to be different
and started to treat organisms, other forms of life,
as being simply material in a mechanistic sense.
And it led to another kind of dualism.
I'm sorry, I'm banging on here,
but I just wanted to get you to feel of where our thoughts,
I think, lie.
It led to another kind of dualism, which we've referred to,
which is a mechanistic dualism.
In other words, you look for the bit within the system
that is driving the system.
And we don't think there is a bit within the system
that drives the system.
The system drives the system.
That's the whole essence of life.
It's the distinctive feature of living organisms.
And so I think that's where we are.
And then, of course, on top of that,
the idea that we've kind of developed over the years
is this idea that the system at its different nested levels,
nested functionality from the cells to the tissues,
to the organs, to the organ systems and so on,
and to the body and to the social interactions
and this inter-species interaction, the ecological,
leads to different levels of intelligence, if you like,
different ways of using information about what's going on.
So cells will influence cells and communicate it with each other.
It's absolutely vital to the functionality.
And a lot of that has got lost, we feel, in medicine, actually,
that we've stopped looking for the way the system controls itself
and the way that that control of itself can be a fundamental
in what goes wrong with health.
And then, of course, you reach the sort of rather more outer level,
if you like, which we regard,
that is regarded as the psychological self, if you like,
which creates all the sort of problems of the mind-body,
which is, of course, how on earth can this apparently immaterial
aspect of our lives influence the material?
And, of course, in a sense, it's not as immaterial as people think it is.
And that's the key there, I think, that there's no...
And it's an open system, of course.
It's exchanging what is fundamental about that outer layer,
that outer cultural level, if you like,
psychosocial, cultural level.
It is what exists beyond the materiality of us as individuals
and therefore has a kind of spiritualism,
if you see what I mean, but without a dualism.
It has a spiritualism in the sense that there is something,
some aspect of maintaining the integrity of the system
that is not necessarily the maintaining of us personally.
And that is, I think, a crucial understanding.
And in a sense, we commune with that as part of it.
Some people ask me when I express this that, you know,
are you talking about panpsychism?
I don't know whether I am or not.
I don't think there's any need necessarily to sort of label it.
But I understand why they ask that question.
You know, depending on how one defines a psychological state,
there are certainly social states.
And those social states are to do with the way we behave as ensemble,
as groups, as opposed to as individuals.
And it's not just simply an aggregate of individual behavior.
What happens when we behave as groups?
That becomes a kind of a communion,
a different way of communicating.
We don't have to do what we're doing now,
which is to explain ourselves to each other
when we're behaving in that kind of way.
In fact, the vast majority of us, you know,
we just don't have time to do that.
We behave in that way.
We create psychocultural norms, if you like,
in terms of normative behavior.
And they will differ from culture to culture,
different kinds of cultures.
And over time, they will change in responsiveness
as a way of solving the problems.
I'm going on far too much.
But I think that encapsulates where we are, I suppose.
Sorry, I went on a bit long with that.
And you probably didn't.
There are so many aspects to it.
It's not surprising, therefore,
that I think that people can get so muddled over it all,
including us.
And I think it's great
because it shows your passion towards the topic.
Dennis, anything about what Ray just mentioned
that you'd like to add on or clarify?
I don't think I need to.
No.
The fact is that we can finish each other's sentences.
I mean, this is a ridiculous communion.
It's true.
I mean, ever since ages ago,
we know where the mind is going of the other one.
We could easily finish.
I was waiting to finish any of those sentences.
So, this pins down where we are.
And you might as well begin whenever you want, Tevin.
Look, I think the best place to start,
you guys have both been in this field for such a long time.
And over the last few years,
I've noticed a nice shift or transition
into the philosophical aspects of it all.
Sort of bringing this all.
And I appreciate that
because it fits then perfectly within this podcast.
Because as a doctor,
someone who's deeply ingrained within biology, physiology,
I'm very fascinated personally
by the philosophical elements that our work entails.
And I want to first start with definitions, guys.
So, let's try and define
your philosophical idea of the mind-body problem.
And obviously, the problem of this mind-matter dichotomy already.
And thereafter, let's define life and consciousness.
Anyone can start.
I'll do a beginning.
I think I come from a long period of interacting
with a number of very good philosophers.
And it's been a privilege to interact with them.
And I think what I've come round to
are two things that matter.
One is that many have felt
that given the way biology was developing
in the 20th century,
under the influence of Francis Crick's central dogma
and various gene-centric interpretations,
that they somehow had to position the mind
in a completely determinist world.
And I don't think it's possible.
And, you know, I've discussed this with,
for example, Anthony Kenny many times.
He did his best as a philosopher
to approach these questions
accepting that biology had shown
that it's a determinate world.
Well, it just ain't.
That's the first thing.
There is massive stochasticity.
There is almost virtual impossibility,
computational explosion and all of that
to account for things in determinate models.
So that's the first thing I would say.
And the second thing they did
was, therefore, to become too captivated
by the need to either go with Descartes
or against him.
And we don't see the need
to bother with that argument at all.
That would be my gloss on the way Ray began.
Yes.
Ray, anything about that you'd like to add on?
Yes, just to continue on from that aspect
of the stochasticity, the variability,
the almost unpredictable variability
at that very basic level,
is that nothing can work without that.
If it is both a problem for life
and the reason for life in a sense.
And what the system does, as we express it,
is that it harnesses that energy
from that stochasticity and that variability
to create the things it needs to create
in order to solve the problems it needs to solve
in order to maintain its integrity.
The distinctive feature of life, I think,
is that there is this self-maintenance
of integrity.
It doesn't do that by meaning the same.
It does it by adaptation, by change,
at various stages and times.
So it can have an adaptation,
which is transgenerationally,
in response to longer-term changes.
And it can have, which, unfortunately,
the sort of modern view put aside,
because it had this inherent view
of inheritance of acquired characteristics,
as it were.
In other words, the use of information
in one generation to solve the problems
in the future, knowing in a sense
that you can't solve them immediately.
But if some of you can,
if there is sufficient variability
within the system for the systems
to explore different ways
of dealing with a problem,
you can develop faculty.
And that leads me to another distinction,
which is the distinction between,
and it's not an absolute distinction,
and I'll come back to that in a moment,
but the distinction between
the development of faculty on the one hand,
both in terms of development
and also in terms of evolution,
the ability to do something,
and what one does with it,
which I will call facultative.
So the distinction between faculty
on the one hand and facultative.
And if you focus just on the faculty,
you end up with kind of just looking
at the anatomy and physiology,
if you like.
I mean, here is my,
it's beautiful, no doubt.
I mean, look at it.
These are my fingers
and my hands and my arms.
And if you look at the fantastic relationship
between the muscles and the skeleton
and how it works,
or if you look at organisms
that are arthropods, for example,
the extraordinary beauty
of the arrangements that they've got
to do similar kinds of things,
which is to move.
The reason why these are there to move
is not so much inherent in the faculty,
but in the facultative.
In other words,
what are you doing with them?
And in a sense,
these are tools of the system.
Society, the scientists
don't seem to have much problem.
If I point to a hammer and say,
you know, that hammer is used
to knock nails in
and hold things together,
or that screwdriver
is designed to unscrew things
or whatever,
an implement that has been made
in order to do something,
because it's created to do something,
then you can see reason in it.
And this is important, reason.
See, reason is, as it were,
the non-material bit,
because it's the situational logic.
Why has that been created?
It's been created in order
to solve the particular problem
of holding things together
or unscrewing things
or doing things that we need to do.
What's really odd is the fact
that here I have this pencil,
which I use to write down notes.
I'm going to be doing it
while we're talking,
in case I need to make a note
of something.
And it's a curious kind of thing
that somehow or other,
they want us to divorce the idea
that this has reason behind it,
but this hand that uses it doesn't.
And it makes no sense to me
because this cannot do anything
without this.
And this can't do very much
without this, you see.
So I don't know what happens
to science when it's somehow or other,
the more it gets into this,
the more it becomes hard
and says, oh, you know,
you can't have reason.
You can't have why.
Of course, one of the difficulties
of why is that you can't measure it.
I mean, the why is certainly
immaterial in that sense.
It's not something that can be
clearly weighed on a scale.
I mean, what is half a reason?
I don't know, you see.
So it's terribly difficult
to partition and sort of say
what it is.
What it is, of course,
is the situational logic.
And that situational logic
is created in large part
by us, by life.
Life is both problem solving
and problem creating.
So it creates the reason.
The reason, we don't have to create
some reason from somewhere else.
You know, it's a Plato kind of,
you know, platonic kind of sense of,
you know, there's an ideal out there.
If only we could find it.
And, you know, the philosophers,
of course, have the skill
of being able to tell us what it is.
That somehow or other,
the essence of being,
essences of being what we are.
And if only we knew what they were,
we'd know the real,
the real Ray Noble, you see,
is the essence of me.
And this kind of concept
of an essence of that
that really drives the system,
it either leads you
to the hard materialistic view
or mechanistic view of the,
you know, it's the genome.
I mean, I've seen people refer
to Aristotle's view of the soul
as being almost like the genome,
which I think is bonkers.
It's not like that at all.
And in fact, he saw
some of the fundamental problems
with dualism,
which is, again,
how do you partition it?
I mean, how do you,
if you have a faculty to act,
why are you creating a faculty
for the faculty to act?
Why can't the faculty act
without there being a faculty
for the faculty to act, you see?
And I mean, you can find that
in Aristotle's writings as well, you see.
And so why do we need a genome
in order to act?
In order to, you know,
no gene is involved in this
when I'm using my pencil.
And no gene certainly determines
what it is I'm thinking
when I'm writing
on a piece of paper with it.
I mean, it's very important
to clarify there, Ray,
just to interrupt a moment.
Yes.
A very important to clarify there
is that it does take time
to change gene expression levels.
So there is inevitably
a block on being able,
if you're doing something quickly
like playing the piano,
no genes are varying during that.
And indeed, you know,
the heartbeat,
which is what I modeled many years ago,
there's no time for gene expression
to change during each heartbeat.
That's something that people
seem to have missed.
Largely, I think,
because Dawkins is so utterly convincing
with his simplistic explanations
of a gene-centric view.
But once you abandon that
and realize that there's massive stochasticity,
even at the molecular level,
that, of course,
comes from the water-based system,
which has naturally got huge stochasticity.
We'll never model
all the trillions of water molecules
there are even in a single cell,
let alone doing it in a whole body.
So I keep coming back to that fact
that we have to recognize
that organisms are operating
within an effectively infinite space
of possibility.
I love the fact that,
I know, Dennis,
when you speak about this whole issue,
you talk about how
if someone can create
an artificial intelligence,
it'll be more impressive
when they make one out of water
because then they've basically...
Exactly so.
I think it would be necessary
because I can't otherwise...
You see, their answer would be,
look, Dennis,
you've made a huge fundamental mistake.
The software is not dependent
on the hardware.
And I say, wait a minute.
What are organisms?
They're not software dependent
on the hardware.
They are integrative holes.
There is no distinction like that.
What is true is that
what you sometimes refer to
as the hardware,
the genes and the proteins
they can create,
are immensely fluid.
We know, for example,
that the proteins can multitask.
You can have a protein
that goes into a membrane
and act as a channel
and the same protein
can be an enzyme
in a different context.
And most proteins are like that.
We know now about 70%
have got variable...
Well, what has happened
is easy to understand too.
It was shown in the first sequencing
of the human genome in 2001.
If you compare the different species
for a particular type of protein,
let's say it's a chromatin,
and you look at what's happened,
bits have been added on.
There's been accretion
of functional bits.
But that means that sometimes
in a complex protein,
there may be seven or eight
functional bits
that can be used
for that purpose
or this purpose.
And they can be totally different.
It's different between
controlling iron
moving in and out
of a cell membrane
in a red cell
or enabling a conitase
to do the enzymatic work
that it's doing.
It's as different as that.
You know,
so we've got to recognize
that there's a much more
fluid situation
that life encounters.
And that's true
even in a single cell.
If I represent a nucleotide
nucleotide
is the size of my fist
and here
in Oxford
it's the nucleus,
this is the edge
of the cell
that will be way up
in Scotland.
It's that huge.
It's quite astonishing
when you think about
when you guys think
about the current
state of biology
where do you think
there's been a fundamental
misunderstanding
with,
for you brought up Dawkins
and he's played a huge role
with his Selfish Gene book
and the way people
are able to absorb that book
because the content
is quite accessible.
Where do you think
there's been a fundamental
misunderstanding
with how we perceive
concepts like life
or mind?
Sad to say
it's the unfortunate
interpretations
of molecular biology.
There are several
key facts
that just don't
fit
with the
current
theories.
First,
DNA does not
replicate like a crystal.
It does not
self-replicate.
It relies on
the organism itself
to be able to
correct many errors
in the replication
process.
Second,
there is no
Weissman barrier.
There is
what's the word
we use sometimes,
Ray?
The boundary
between the SOMA
and the germline.
Yes,
but it's a functional
boundary.
And we know
that control RNAs
can just pass
across that
very readily.
We know
that many
examples of that.
I do a paper
that I published
with a colleague
just last year.
Well,
2023.
We're now
2025.
2023,
I think.
Anyway,
it simply
shows
the many
examples
of little
vesicles
of RNAs
and control
proteins
and so on
crossing
that boundary.
So Weissman barrier,
I'm afraid,
is gone.
Inheritance of
acquired characteristics.
But we're now
then into the
epigenetic area.
And here again
is a major fault.
What Richard,
I think,
would say
is,
okay,
some of that
is an
honorary gene.
He uses that
expression,
actually,
in his debates
with people.
Yes,
I'll accept that
as an honorary gene.
But once you do
that,
you're changing
the definition
of a gene
such that
the whole theory
becomes a
tautology.
There is no
way you can
test it
experimentally.
And that,
I'm afraid,
is true
of the
selfish gene
theory.
He's very
clever.
He's produced
a structure
that seems
to make
extraordinary
sense
if you stay
within it.
But as soon
as you realise
DNA does not
replicate like a
crystal,
that there is
no Weissman
barrier,
and that
inheritance of
acquired characteristics
can occur
through epigenetics.
And we can go
into the detail
of any of those
if we need to.
But those are
the three main
things that are
just misinterpretations
of the molecular
biology.
And believe you
me,
over the last
20 years,
we've furrowed
in that area
to such a degree.
When I put
all of those
points to Richard
Dawkins two years
ago in a debate
at the Institute
of Art and Ideas
Festival,
he didn't answer
any of those.
He simply
repeated his
mantra,
genes are
causal.
Genes are
causal.
And genes are
causal because
we can measure
an association
between the
two.
To a
physiologist,
association can
be zero and
it can still
be causal.
That's right,
Dennis.
And I think
there's also
been a fundamental
reaching out to
your philosophers
now.
There's also
been a fundamental
philosophical error
made, I think.
And it goes back
to what we were
saying a little bit
earlier that
there's a concept
that if you
abandon
materialism,
that you're
suggesting that
there is something
which is
supernatural.
Yes, exactly.
What we've
tried to do is
to show people
that this is not
necessarily the
case at all,
that reason is
not supernatural,
it is natural.
It's the only
way nature
can work
because all
organisms, we
say in our
little book,
Understanding
Living Systems,
all organisms
have to assess
their environment
and they do so
by sensing it,
but also by
anticipating it.
All organisms
are dynamically
engaged in their
environment and
continuously
assessing it.
Now, perhaps
in the simplest
of organisms,
unicellular
organisms, that
assessment is
relatively simple,
although actually
when you look at
it, it's rather
complex.
And it involves
an enormous amount
of changing of
state and
exploratory
behavior.
And, you
know, as you
going back to
this idea that
as it were,
systems are
nested within
each other,
organelles are
nested within
the cells and
the cells
integrative
function, and
each cell is
nested within
multicellular
organisms.
Multicellular
organisms may
have come
together in a
sense through
the same kind
of variabilities
that exist within
the cells
themselves, that,
you know,
cells will come
together, merge
to create new
organisms.
organisms, and
in the early
period of
evolution, that
may have been
a fundamental
in determining
the way different
species were
created, until
what we see
now are very
much more
definitive
species and
groups, but
the sort of
symbiotic
relationships that
can exist.
But going
back to this
philosophical
thing, I
think another
mistake that
the selfish
gene makes is
regarding the
gene as an
immutable
bit.
Richard makes a
great deal of
this in the
selfish gene
itself, in the
book.
book, this
always reminds
me a little
of Plato's
idea, if you
like, of, you
know, that
there has to
be some pure
thing that
maintains itself
that isn't, and
of course the
problem with
being is the
fact that it's
continually
changing.
The world is
full of flux, so
what on earth
should it be?
What is the
essence of being
a horse, or a
dog, or a
cat, or a
human being, or
a chair, or
whatever?
And of course
it isn't like
that.
There isn't a
system that
exists outside
determining what
it is that it
should be.
But curiously, I
think that
Richard Dawkins
and others have
made a similar
kind of mistake,
but in a
mechanistic way,
of saying that
what it must be
must be determined
by something
which is pure.
And their whole
mathematics, in a
sense, their
whole kind of
maths approach
to it, is to
assume that, you
know, the whole
existence, you
know, is to
maintain genes in
a gene pool.
Well, genes don't
exist in a gene
pool.
It's a figment of
imagination in any
event.
There isn't a gene
pool.
The genes are in
us.
And yes, you can
regard us as a
pool, but once you
decide that they're
in us and not in a
gene pool, the idea
of maintaining genes
in a gene pool
evaporates.
I mean, why on
earth would you want
to maintain genes in
a gene pool, when in
a gene pool they can
do absolutely nothing?
The only way that
genes can do
anything at all is
by being used by
systems that they
exist in, which are
organisms.
And the crucial
thing is here not to
maintain the
integrity of the
gene, the
immutability of the
gene, it is to
change it.
And when you look at
how this works in
practice, the genes
are, yes, they're
right that genes are
a problem because the
errors are occurring
all the time.
And those errors have
to be corrected.
And there's a whole
machinery that exists to
correct those changes.
If we didn't have that
machinery within
ourselves, we would
soon fall apart.
In other words, we
will fail to do what
organisms do, which is
to maintain their
integrity and their
integrative function.
And how they do that
will change with age
because with age, we
do maintain our
integrity in somewhat
different ways.
And so we have to
adapt to the fact that
we're not doing it in
the same kind of way.
When you reach the age
of 70 plus, for
example, you're no
longer doing it by
generating more brain
cells or you're not
generating it by
altering the synaptic
sort of connections in
the system other than
perhaps losing more of
them and so on.
So you're having to
adapt to the fact that
physically your
faculties are not as
supple or as
as responsive as
they were before and
you adapt to them.
But this is not not
about keeping
everything the same.
It's adapting and
changing.
And that's true at all
levels.
It's true as a
cultural level.
Cultures have to
adapt, otherwise
they cease to exist.
And any system that
seeks to say what
something should be is
problematic.
It creates a closed
system, which is then
unable to adapt.
And that leads us to
the sort of
philosophical problem
at the social level.
Is there a better
way of being?
Well, probably, but I
don't know what it
would be.
And I think that
attempts to define it
probably lead to more
likely breakdown of
social existence than
it does enhancing it
because we're
dependent on the
variability, not
maintaining things the
same.
And I think this is a
major philosophical
mistake that the
materialists made in a
sense by honing in on
the gene as the
immutable bit.
And that's the
logic.
The immortal, that's
extraordinary.
Yes.
The immortal gene, not
immortal at all.
Yes, that was the
name he was, when he
was considering to name
it initially, before his
publishers told him to
name it the selfish
gene.
That's right, yes.
Yes, I think
something that in
itself created another
philosophical problem of
a moral kind, because
see, it kind of, I
know that Richard wouldn't
have intended this to be
the case, but it led to
the acceptance of the
notion that we are all
born selfish.
And this is fundamentally
philosophically flawed
because you can't be
selfish unless you have a
choice not to be.
And that is
fundamental, you see.
And I don't understand,
you can't be regarded as
selfish.
As a baby, a baby cannot
be regarded as selfish.
I mean, all organisms,
of course, as I've said,
you know, we're
definitively seeking to
maintain our integrity.
But that in itself is not
selfish.
And none of us could
exist if we didn't do
that.
None of us could exist
without helping each
other maintain our
integrity, which leads to
mutualism.
It leads to symbiotic
activity.
It leads to communal
activity.
It leads to social
activity.
It leads to give and
take.
It leads to a kind of
morality, if you like,
that is certainly
fundamentally different to
the concept that we're all
born selfish.
selfish.
And it also leads to
situations like in packs of
wolves, for example,
where equity matters.
And, you know,
individual members of a
group, of a pack in
wolves can be punished
if they don't behave
correctly.
In other words, they don't
behave for the sake of the
group.
And, but at the same time as
that is the case, you've
still got to have the
outriders for evolution to
be able to occur.
You've still got to have
those within the group that
are going to behave
differently, who are going
to be out slightly outside
the norm.
And that at the social level
is also fundamentally
creative.
And if you don't have that,
you're not going to be able
to evolve culturally and
adapt readily as groups.
So even that moral
normativeness, if you like,
in wolves has variability at
the edges.
I mean, it will allow certain
kinds of,
certain kinds of behavior
which is, is, is not
conducive, so conducive to
maintaining the organization
of the pack.
I think it's, it's, there's
almost a, a beautiful
mirroring here when you're
talking about that sticks,
putting, sticking out and
doing something creative
because you guys are doing
something similar in that
regard with your thought
processes and trying to bring
back some sort of a, a
holistic view of everything.
Do you guys find that when
you approach your work,
you're attacked from two
sides, let's say.
There's one group, let's say
materialists, reductionists,
because in, in a sense, you
are not necessarily reducing
us to our parts, but
acknowledging the extreme
layers of reality and then
bringing them all back
together, which is
beautiful.
But then that means there's,
there are going to be people
out there who still call you
reductionists and don't like
it.
And then on the flip side,
the reductionists who are
fundamental reductionists don't
like the fact that you guys are
almost bringing this holistic
aspect.
So you're almost stuck in the
middle, kind of, kind of like
politics when someone's either
extreme left, extreme right.
You're kind of in this
relational in the middle zone.
Do you find that makes it a
little bit harder to get a
point across?
Well, you're putting your
finger on a very important
divide.
So let's first of all get the
divide clear.
Just read page 18 as the
biggest textbook of evolutionary
biology, Futuma and Kirkpatrick's.
book just called Evolution.
Page 18 there, there's a, I
think it's page 18, I could be
out by a page or two.
Anyway, it's quite near the
beginning.
It's the only page in the book
that is devoted to philosophy.
And it is to dismiss it.
And it ends with the statement,
there is no room in science for
purpose.
Full stop.
There's no justification, no
argument as to why that statement
is necessarily true.
That needs exposition.
It needs a philosophical argument
for why that should be accepted.
There's none.
Now, we are effectively saying,
not only are organisms
purposive and evidently so,
we don't really need to bother too
much about precisely what that
range of purpose is.
We can see the purposiveness.
But very interestingly, as
physiologists, we know also that a
purposive explanation actually
predicts downwards towards the
molecular level as to what kinds of
mechanisms must exist for that
purpose to exist than the other way
round.
What is interesting here is that
purposive explanations actually lead
to good science.
Good reductionist science, if you
want to call it that.
That's the strange thing.
So by making that blanket statement,
as happens in Fatuma's and Kirkpatrick's
book, we are actually closing off a
major scientific question.
What is this doing?
Why does it consume 20% of the total
energy that we use?
It's got nothing to do with whether
there's something ghostly out there,
that as it were, is a goal that is
somewhere out there dragging us towards
something.
That sort of causation is not involved.
All it's postulating is that there is
anticipation of what might happen in the
future.
And that has nothing to do with backward
time causation or anything ghostly like
that.
All it's got to have, any organism, is the
ability to anticipate very many different
reactions rapidly to crisis situations.
And that can only be done by having an
anticipatory process occurring inside here.
It's all good science.
There's absolutely no reason why attributing
purpose to organisms is non-scientific.
That's rubbish.
And by learning.
And by learning, too.
I mean, one of the crucial things about that
enhances anticipation is learning to
associate different levels of activity.
Now, in the old days, behaviorists used to
treat this in a reflexive kind of way,
associated reflexes and so on.
That if you, you know, if you ring bells and
things and then stimulate the organism, the
organism learns to do whatever it needs to do in
order to do, you know, prevent being electrocuted
or whatever this is, excuse me, the
behaviorists wanted to do to them if they
didn't press the button or press the lever.
And then they started measuring, measuring
the behavior, the intelligence of the
organism, how well it responded in that
kind of environment.
I mean, if I bung you in a chamber and then
give you a lever to pull and you accidentally
pull it one day because you're starving, you
haven't been fed for a whole day and a half or
two days or three days or even a week and you
accidentally press this button or even just
simply sit there as a human being, cogitate a
bit and say, I wonder what will happen if I
press this button and you press the button and
lo and behold, a peanut arrives or something.
I mean, and you go on pressing the button to get
the peanut.
I mean, is that really a definition of human
intelligence?
Up to some point, it might be.
And the fact that we learn, we learn to press
things and do things to create and so on.
But what we're doing there is reasoning.
And it's a curious thing that people want to leave
the reasoning out.
Oh, it's all reflexive.
Well, it isn't all reflexes.
I mean, if you look at the way a crow solves the
problem of getting food out of a jar of water and
it starts doing it by doing all sorts of creative
things.
I mean, there were some, you know, extraordinarily
imaginative things.
For example, I mean, it was the person, Dennis, who was
the chap who weighed things by the displacement of
water.
Remind me again.
Who?
Are we talking about Avogadro?
I don't know.
Anyway, he decided that you could measure things by
seeing amount of water that was displaced.
Who was the chap that did the Eureka thing in the bath,
Dennis, wasn't it?
A displacement of water.
I may be wrong, but I think there's Avogadro.
Well, I can't remember.
Anyway, whatever, whoever he was, you see, I mean, it's
a bit like the crow.
I mean, the crow knew that if you could displace the water
by putting...
Oh, yes, that was very clever of the crow.
Yes, that's right.
I mean, then the water rises and the thing that's floating
in the water gets to the point where it can put its
beak in and collect it.
Now, indeed, that's a measure of intelligence.
And it's the reason for the action.
Why is the crow doing that?
I think what you're getting at, Ray, yes.
Sorry, just coming quickly on this.
I think what you're getting at is that the learning is unlimited.
Yes.
That's the point.
It's no longer reflexive because it's unlimited.
Yes, unlimited associated learning, which is a crucial
ingredient of it.
And so I don't understand why they have such a problem with
a reason that they would seek to dismiss it as a fundamental
of causality.
When you look at what we've termed in our little book,
Understanding Living Systems, Ecological Intelligence,
Ecological Intelligence is precisely that understanding
of what is happening in the environment and why.
And the why is as important to all organisms as it is to us.
If Jack and Jill go up the hill to fetch a pail of water,
and I ask you, why did Jack and Jill go up the hill?
You might say, because you now know, they went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
And I ask you, why did Jack fall down?
You don't answer that simply by how did Jack fall down?
Although you might try.
You may say, well, he slipped on a stone and lost his balance.
And I might say to you, but what if Jill pushed him?
They were playing, having fun, flirting with each other.
And she pushed him and he tripped on a stone and fell down the hill
and broke his crown.
The only way you can understand that situation is by reason.
The reason, and this is the problem, and it's a philosophical problem,
no doubt, the reason may be wrong.
And what we do with that in practice as organisms is to try
and work out the probability of it being wrong.
And even then, we may not be right.
When we see a chimpanzee pick up a stone,
because we have learnt that chimpanzees use stones sometimes,
not all chimpanzees do this,
but groups of chimpanzees use stones to crack nuts.
And it's good for them because they can crack nuts
that are harder to crack just by their hands alone.
And so they find and repurpose stones.
They even reshape the stones in order to make them better suited
to cracking nuts.
They'll even secrete a really good stone
so that they can go back to it and use it again when needed.
All these are reasons.
How can you possibly understand chimpanzee behaviour
without knowing those reasons?
You can't.
Now, you may be wrong in your anticipation
when you see a chimpanzee pick up a stone
and you think, ah, he's going to crack nuts.
Well, I may be wrong.
He may crack heads with it.
He may throw it at you.
He may be fed up with you as silly behaviourists
trying to understand his intelligence
by not taking into account the fact
that he has reasons for doing things.
And the chimpanzee also will look at other chimpanzees.
And when they see them picking up stones,
they might think also, ah, we're going to crack nuts.
But they may have already learned too
that sometimes some recalcitrant chimpanzees
use it to throw at them and do other things with it.
And the problem is that it's not easily measurable.
It's not easy to know when you're right.
And philosophy teaches us that that's true of so many problems.
You know, even the problem of understanding reality
in perception is a fundamental one.
And unless we understand the difficulties inherent in it,
I don't understand how we can be good scientists, as it were.
Because science is, to some extent,
looking for better ways of measuring
the reasons why something happens
or the purpose or the causes.
And if reasons are part of the cause,
we need to find ways of seeing how they can be.
Yes, that, I think, is part of what we were trying to do
in one of our articles, Ray.
And our tentative solution there is an alignment issue.
How is it that the processes occurring here
can align out of many behavioral options,
which it's already got
because it has a huge behavioral repertoire there.
How does it align that best
with what the social context,
as it were, dictates,
but we'll use the word dictate carefully,
doesn't mean to say determined,
but rather encourages certain ways of acting
better than others.
And I think it's hard to deny
that we align our behavior
with our moral and other social convictions.
Otherwise, how does a social group hang together?
That is part of the social hanging together.
And it will be different in different cultures.
There are some cultures that forbid kissing in public.
There are others that accept it.
It's as different as that.
And that, of course, would be,
let's say, Paris at one end
and Japan, Tokyo at the other end.
And they will have their own differences
on what they regard as it being desirable
to align yourself to.
But they are necessary
because they're allowing that alignment.
And because there is cohesion.
Yeah.
And also, the other thing that this leads to is,
which I think is significant
in what we've been trying to say to people,
which is that
materialism is not incompatible
with free will.
Materialism isn't the same as deterministic.
Exactly.
Mechanical system is deterministic.
If you look at how clocks work
and the clockwork works as clockwork
and it does it in ways that it's going to do it.
Once you've wound it up, it'll do it.
And it's readily predictable
because it does it in a deterministic way.
But that is not the fundamental of materialism.
As we made the point clear earlier,
that one of the fundamentals in life
is the extraordinary stochasticity.
And much of life functions by harnessing that.
The very nature of our functioning of our brains,
for example,
is dependent upon harnessing the stochasticity of ions,
different ions within the nerve cells.
And with the synapses,
there's a huge amount of variability
which is harnessed.
And when you look at nerves...
I mean, I was a neuroscientist for many years.
I trained as a neuroscientist.
I trained as a sociologist and a neuroscientist.
And I'll tell you where,
you know, some people might think,
well, you know, you were a reductionist
because you were looking at
what individual cells were doing
in the nervous system.
Because I did.
I'm quite proud of the fact
that I was able to record intracellularly
as if this was some grand...
Like landing on the moon.
You know, great kind of achievement.
You land inside the cell with an electrode
and you record the potential difference
across the membrane.
And I was doing it with particular kind of cells.
I was interested in receptive fields in the skin.
How do...
Our symmetocentric system.
How do we sense the environment
in terms of touch?
And there were various ideas that we had
as a background to what we were looking at.
And one of those was that
how we locate a stimulus on the skin
depended on the lability
of the receptive fields of the sensory cells.
That they could be...
Those sensory...
Those sensory fields,
those receptive fields,
moment by moment,
could change in their size.
in the area,
moment by moment,
by using a combination of excitatory
and inhibitory processes
within the somatosensory system.
And so when you record the neurons,
you find that this is exactly the case.
You map out the receptive field
under certain conditions.
And then what we did was to see
what happens to those receptive fields
if you do touch the skin.
And if you touch the skin,
the receptive fields shrink.
And what this does is to enable
the system to have greater acuity.
And by doing that,
it is more able to locate
the stimulus on the skin.
Now, that doesn't mean
that the answer was self-evident
in what we were doing
by recording the cells.
When you record the cells,
you pop inside a cell
and you hear this terrible waffle
going on all the time.
Waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle,
in sound.
We translate the electrical activity
and sound.
And what all this waffling is
are the electrical potentials.
And what those electrical potentials are
are the exchange of ions
of charged particles
across the membrane
going waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle.
Sometimes the waffling,
waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle,
gets closer to what's called
the action potential,
if you like,
the threshold for generating
an action potential.
And then the cell
will generate an action potential
or more likely
a burst of action potentials.
And you get a different
kind of sound, you see.
It's full of sound
in terms of what we translate it as.
But the point here is
that waffling is going on
all the time.
This is waffling.
All this waffle
and spurting and splashing
is going on in our brain
all the time.
If you were to monitor
what's happening at the synapses,
billions of them,
billions of synapses
going on here all the time.
It's waffling.
But that waffling
is kind of like,
it's like having a lump
of soggy clay
on a potter's wheel
that it can be shaped
and changed
in response to various states.
States.
And in a sense,
this goes back to this idea
of states as consciousness.
What is consciousness?
Consciousness is a state of being.
It is no more than that.
And in a sense,
it is far more than that.
But because it gives us
the ability to sense
our own sensing.
To be aware of our integrity.
Consciousness to me
is like a readiness,
if you like,
to act
and thereby anticipatory.
And it goes back
to what Dennis
was saying earlier,
that the key thing there
is anticipation.
It's the state of readiness
and anticipating
what it is
that's going on
in the world,
regardless of whether
we're right about it.
We cannot function
without that.
And that is consciousness.
That is demonstrating,
isn't it, Ray?
Yes, just briefly.
There are what are called
readiness potentials
in the nervous system
that have been recorded
as inevitably
what happens
when you are in the process
of making a decision.
It's fascinating.
It really is.
They are readiness potentials.
The system is getting itself
geared up.
And we feel that consciously, too.
It is.
Well, that is the feeling.
That is the consciousness, Dennis.
That is the consciousness.
And, you know,
I'll say something
really highly controversial now.
Something that Dennis
and I have been discussing
more recently
and also with other colleagues,
I have to say.
A lot of this comes
from discussions
with a group
that we interact
with in Edinburgh
or based in Edinburgh
that looks at choices
and the biology of choices,
choices in systems
and organisms.
And obviously,
anticipation is a vital
aspect of choice
because
you can't really make it
without some anticipation
of what the result
will be of any decision
or action that you take.
So there's an enormous amount
of anticipation
involved in how organisms
make choices.
But all organisms
make choices.
And all organisms
have states of readiness
to make choices.
and all organisms
to varying degrees
indeed
have an ability
to identify self
in some kind
of functional way.
They don't all eat
their own backsides,
for example,
because they recognize
the fact that it is self,
as it were.
Now, they don't do it
in a linguistic way
like I've just done.
They don't use the word self.
That's me.
And I am who I am.
They don't do it linguistically.
But we do.
And that is another level
of doing it.
But it doesn't mean
that consciousness,
as it were,
has simply emerged
out of that process
of doing.
You know,
one can just as readily
see things like readiness
and a sense of integrity
at very, very low level
forms of life.
I don't like the word
low level.
They're extraordinarily
complex and,
you know,
and have an enormous
range of functional capacity.
And what we tend to do
with the lower forms
is to just simply
regard them in a robotic,
excuse me,
in a robotic kind of way
that they just
an algorithm could
explain their behavior.
In large part,
yes, indeed.
I mean,
if you look at a paramecium,
it sort of moves forward
and bumps into something
and then comes back
and changes its angle
of approach
and moves forward.
And eventually
it gets around the object.
That's a kind of intelligence
in a way,
but they'll say,
oh, well,
that's just simply
an algorithm.
When you get very,
very complex algorithms
that involve
a choice
between algorithms,
how do you choose
which algorithm
to insert,
if you like?
And we don't like
the idea
of inserting
an algorithm.
Variability
isn't just inserted
within a various system
to create
decision making.
The variability
is existent
all the time,
throughout,
everywhere in the system.
it's variability,
it's stochastic.
The problem
is not
so much that.
The problem
is how does
the system
constrain it?
And it
leads to what
we've called
boundary conditions
and the way
the boundaries
function
as molding
this stochasticity
into
reasoned function,
objective functionality.
functionality.
And
but not only
do we say
that it does that,
but we actually
say that that
definitively is
what reason is,
if that makes
any kind of sense.
What do you have
to do here,
Ray,
just to come in
briefly on this,
what you have to do
is to distinguish
between the different
forms of causation.
Much of it
in the social
context
is causation
by form,
not by mechanism.
and that was
a fundamental
distinction
introduced by
Aristotle
in his
De Anima
2,000 odd
years ago.
And that's
again to come
back to
dear Richard.
I call him
dear Richard
because I've
known him
for so long.
But you know,
he just ignores
this distinction.
He just simply
says,
well genes
are our causes.
But he doesn't
clarify what he
means by a cause.
I say they
are effectively
as sequences
causes of
form.
It is the
form of the
sequence that
is used to
translate into
an RNA and
then into
a protein.
The DNA
itself doesn't
do anything
about that.
It gets
read,
yes,
but it
doesn't actually,
it is not an
active process.
And this
distinction between
active and passive
causation is
utterly fundamental
in physiology.
If I measure,
for example,
the association
level between
knocking out a
particular gene
that's responsible
for pacemaker
rhythm and
observe a change
in rhythm,
maybe 10%.
I also know
as a physiologist
has worked out
the full
dynamic causation,
that the actual
contribution can be
80%.
The difference
between active
causation and
associative score,
which is what the
GWAS people are
measuring,
is fundamental.
You can have a GWAS
score of zero and
there can still be a
huge contribution to
causation.
It's just that the
system is very
robust.
If one mechanism
doesn't work, it
uses another one.
And that is
fundamental here.
And it's the reason
why most of the GWAS
scores are very low.
The only ones that
are high are the
ones that occur for
the monogenetic
diseases where
everybody would
agree that if you've
got cystic
fibrosis, the genes
for that, you'll
have cystic
fibrosis.
Not much you can do
about it.
But they affect
only, roughly
speaking, 5% of
the population.
That's not to deny
that that's important
to that 5%.
It is.
But for the great
majority, 95% of
the association
scores are so low
that they're almost
useless for medical
purposes.
Does anybody go and
take their genome to
their doctor?
Do I go with a
great big book of my
CGs, A's and T's and
say to my doctor,
Joe, could you take
a look at this?
He would laugh me
out of court.
You're touching on
something quite
important there,
Dennis, in the sense
that when we
consider twin studies,
and I think you guys
also touched on this
on your paper, can
reasons and values
influence action or
how might intentional
agency work
physiologically, which
we'll touch on.
Because I do want to
focus on that macro
level causation versus
micro level causation,
how you're able to
bring this up with
harnessing
stochasticity.
But the one thing
you guys touched on
is the fact that in
twin studies, you'll
notice how the genome
there is fine, prepped,
ready to go.
However, both twins are
not actively getting the
same information from
the mother's womb.
So while one might be
receiving a little bit
more blood flow, the
other one might be
receiving a little bit
more nutrients, there's
a varying, there's so
much complexity here and
so many variables to
consider that it's
impossible for us to
actually just say that
you can take a CTA and
combine this to have
someone produce a
certain outcome.
It's not fixed.
It's very, very
variable.
Do you want to
touch on that, any of
you guys?
Well, briefly, from my
point of view, the
egg cell, of course, is
critical in determining
which genes get
activated initially.
It isn't the DNA that
determines that.
It is the egg cell that
has the right mix, if you
want to call it right, a
mix, let's put it that
way, a bit more neutral,
of control molecules, RNAs
and transcription factors
which are characteristic of
that particular egg cell,
which is why I don't think
anybody's going to
recreate the my mother's
egg cell as it was in
February 1936.
It's as simple as that.
They're all different.
And so the idea that
somehow or another you
can get away from the
contextual form of
causation which triggers
the beginning of
development, I think, is
just nonsense.
You need to know the
initial conditions for
the development.
We don't know.
That's a big issue still.
It's an open area of
physiology that needs more
more experimentation.
It is an area of
physiology that I was also
involved in.
It is an area.
As well as having been a
sensory physiologist.
I became a joint director
of a fetal and neonatal
research group at
University College.
And one of the things
that the group were
looking at was the way in
which the maternal system
influences the
developmental choices of
the fetal system and the
way the placenta, largely
through epigenetic
processing, can be
changed in order to
adapt to different
states of nutrition, of
maternal nutrition.
And the outcomes can be
extraordinarily different.
And remember that we're
dealing with, in a sense,
genomes that would be
precisely the same, other
than those early
developmental conditions.
And a group in Southampton
have looked at this in terms
of human women and looked at
this transgenerationally and
found that, for example,
liver function, which is
determined within the womb,
the metabolic strategy, if
you like, of the developing
fetus dictates the metabolic
strategy postnatally and
through to adulthood.
And that also can be passed on
further generationally.
Depends very much on the
circumstances, but they have
found transgenerational changes,
even within humans.
And to me, this was the key
evidence to show that
there can be acquired
characteristics.
And many of those acquired
characteristics operate when
the system is much more
open to change.
So, and there are certain
periods of development when
that is the case.
One is the developing
embryo and the fetus.
The other, of course, is
during adolescence.
And another, curiously, is
when we come to older age.
This is why I referred to
this earlier, the fact that
the system adapts differently
as an older system, but it
is nonetheless a dynamic
adaptation.
It's not just simply a
deterioration.
It's taking account of the
fact that one's faculties are
now, as it were, not as
adaptable.
And, you know, we know that,
for example, I suffer
tremendously from
hypertension.
And that's not going to go
away, but it can be treated
if we know about it, if you
see what I mean.
What's occurring there
physiologically and
functionally?
And we know also that
different people will have
different degrees of that
kind of problem as they age.
And a lot of that is
epigenetically determined,
curiously enough, by what
happened to you in the womb.
And that is an
extraordinary.
So working out what's
cause and effect depends on
the time, the way in which
the organism subsequently
develops, the range of
possible outcomes that can
be, for example, produced
through exercise and various
other things.
and all on the basis of the
same genome.
Do you think that it's
quite, it would be almost
impossible for someone who
does consider this to be a
deterministic world, that
the immeasurable amounts of
variables to consider, I
mean, it's incalculable.
So it's something that at no
point we're ever going to be
able to do this.
So there's almost an
argument here, assuming that
it's possible.
Well, we're never going to
do it because it's not too
difficult to calculate that
you'd need for some of these
potential computations like
computing the activity of all
the water molecules in a single
cell.
That would require
computational power that would
probably require most of the
material in the solar system to
build it.
I mean, it's not too difficult to
see.
Once computational explosion
is rampant, as it is in
systems made of water, you
simply, you're never going to be
able to do fully molecular level
computations.
People try.
And even computing, let's say,
how an iron has its water
molecules surrounding it because
they're all polar and they will
line up like magnets and how far
out this goes and how far you have
to go out and also what state is
the water in?
There are more than just frozen and
fluid.
There are many states, as we know
from the snowflake issue in which
water can, as it were, form
itself.
And again, it's an interaction
between what is in the water, the
proteins, the RNAs and goodness
knows how many metabolites,
hormones and other things, each of
which will in a relativistic way
determine partly what the water is
doing and the fact is that it's
it's incomputable at a molecular
level.
I think it's as simple as that.
There's a very funny thing here
that comes about as well, which
you see, you see, and obviously,
you know, we're physiologists.
I mean, sorry, another hat.
Again, you keep wearing different
hats.
But it's a very interesting thing
that one of the criticisms that we
do receive sometimes is the fact
that we're not, you know, well,
what do you know about evolution?
And they also say to it, they say
to us how mathematics works, how
computations work.
Well, only because you decided what
the end product should be, which is
maintaining genes in a gene pool.
But once you've done that, yes, you
can get a result and show that, well,
they behave like this in order to
maintain their genes in a gene pool by
behaving like that.
But our answer to them is, well, we're
physiologists and our computations work
as well.
But they're fundamentally different from
your computations.
Exactly.
Yes, that's right.
Most of the population genetics
computations are not dynamic.
They're looking for to what will the
system tend to go, which is a valid
way of looking at things.
I don't deny that.
But we as physiologists are necessarily
concerned with how does it move from
where it is to where it might go?
And that requires dynamic differential
equation models.
And also we're concerned as
behaviorists as well as physiologists
with why does it happen?
And again, you need different kinds of
computation to understand that.
So this idea that there's one way of
calculating things and then having a
system that works because it works.
I mean, we've had this said to us at
meetings, you know, that why fix
something that isn't broken?
Well, we say that's fine.
It does what you want it to do.
And it gives you an explanation within
a certain bounds.
But it isn't applicable to either the
physiology as such and in terms of
purpose for something to occur.
I mean, the function of a cell, for
example, within a system can be
differential within the system.
And so you could then say as a
physiologist, the purpose of that cell
is to do whatever it's doing.
So some cells might be filtering in, say,
the relation to the kidney and functions
of the renal system.
And other cells may be concerned with
creating osmotic gradients and so on,
you see.
But you can identify.
This is what's so wonderful about
physiology and anatomy.
You can see the most beautiful
arrangements in order to generate
these osmotic gradients, which are how
our renal system functions.
And then the way it utilizes pumps in
order to create these extraordinary
gradients.
the ways nerve cells generate electrical
gradients, which they can then use to
generate signals, the way the signals
are used in order to generate the
release of chemicals held in packets,
membrane packets, in quanta that are
released at synapses to cause these
things.
And we as physiologists see those things
happening, as it were.
And so we understand reason within that
context, too.
And then at the behavioral level, we
understand reason in the same way as we
were referring to the chimpanzee using a
stone to crack nuts.
And you don't go into a different realm
by doing that.
You're talking about the same problem.
How do we understand behavior?
And we can understand it at various levels.
And those levels are interactive in causal
functionality.
They're not all one way.
They're going backwards, forwards, sideways.
Some of them are just simply conditional.
The beauty, I mean, plants, if you touch
them, it can generate this extraordinary
calcium transient within the cells of the
leaves and so on.
And this spreads through the system.
And what that does is to create a state of
readiness, a preparedness that something is
happening.
But if you look again at plants, you find
that it's actually extraordinarily exquisite
because plants respond in different ways
depending on what it is that has touched it.
Now, that is amazing.
And so you can, in that context, you see,
context, you see, say that the plant responded
in this way because it was touched by
that organism and not by that kind
of organism.
There is reason, you see.
And you cannot understand that ecological
context without understanding the reason.
You can't explain it without that.
And that's, in a sense, that's all we are
saying.
And why it is that people get so cross about
it, it goes back, I think, to the fact that
they want to either, they want to have this
strange, you know, duality that the one
never meets anywhere and can explain the same
thing.
We're explaining the same thing.
Actually, it goes deeper, doesn't it,
historically?
Because once they inserted the Weissmann
barrier as an absolute barrier, that
automatically excluded any physiological
influence on the next generation.
It's as simple as that.
Once you know that that barrier doesn't stop
the control processes from influencing the
next generation, everything is open again.
And you cannot exclude physiology from being
part of what determines the direction of
evolution.
And that's just straightforward.
It's, again, coming back to the fundamental
molecular biological detail that I outlined
earlier.
Once you admit that DNA is not a self
replicator, so it cannot replicate accurately
independently of the cell itself.
In other words, there's no replicator separate
from the vehicle.
And once you've also abandoned the Weissmann
barrier, you can no longer exclude physiological
processes from having a role in the evolutionary
process.
Now, I was told many times by Richard in the
debate with him two years ago, Dennis, your
physiologist, I'm an evolutionary biologist, and
the two are not the same.
I say, you cannot exclude one from the other.
It doesn't, unless you hang on, as it were, at all
costs to the Weissmann barrier and to self
replication.
And neither of those are true.
It's a beautiful gap if you think about it.
A physiologist, and even, so for me as a medical
doctor, I mean, without physiology bridging that gap,
that biological gap to the psychological system,
physiology plays the most fundamental role here.
It has a holistic picture.
I mean, as you guys, to quote you guys, organisms
do not behave as rational calculators.
That's a fundamental process.
Darwin spent the last 10 years of his life collaborating
with the physiologist, George Romanes, because he was
determined to see whether his idea of, well, he didn't know
about the supposed barrier because that only came in 1883 when
he had passed away.
But he was clear that there had to be processes that communicate
from the soma to the germline.
And he spent a lot of time interacting with George Romanes to try to prove
that with various hybridizations.
What was missing in the 19th century was the knowledge of epigenetics.
Once you've got epigenetics, you've got the environment through
physiological processes of epigenetic nature controlling the way the genome
is interpreted, and it doesn't even need that it should be transmitted
by the genome because culturally it can be transmitted without any
bothering with the DNA.
And if an environmental change lasts a long time, which is the only
environmental changes of interest evolutionary wise, then so will the
epigenetic effects exist for a long time, even if there's no assimilation
into the genome.
These are fundamental facts, which I'm afraid our neo-Darwinist rivals
have just simply missed, haven't seen the significance of it.
What they will say is, oh, it all dies out after a generation or two.
But that's only true if you have a point influence from the environment.
If you maintain the environment, it will maintain the epigenetic change.
It's so obvious as to hardly need to be expressed.
Another thing I really enjoy is the way you guys have incorporated music into this
understanding of life and this beautiful synchronicity of the both of them.
Do you want to explore that a bit?
Well, I did that in the music of life deliberately, of course, but that was done largely to produce
a different metaphor from Richard Dawkins' metaphor of the selfish gene.
And so that was its main function.
But actually, I've come to think that there's more to it than just an alternative metaphor.
What is being synchronised when respiration is synchronised with heartbeat variation?
What is being synchronised when the processes of circadian rhythm are synchronised with various hormonal changes?
This is all harmonisation to various degrees.
You can argue about what kind of music this might be, and it may not be Bach-like, it may not even be Beethoven-like.
It may be more like avant-garde than either of those.
But nevertheless, there is there's a sense in which there almost has to be that kind of resonance across different processes within the body,
because it's continually seeking for, well, you might call it the best compromise, because they will all want to go off in different directions.
You've always got to have a kind of compromise on what is regulated this much with the kidney function,
what is regulated that much with the circulatory system and with the hormonal system and the immune system and so on.
And they're all having to be regulated within certain constraints, but not in a terribly deterministic fashion.
It's a hunting process.
Yes, hunting.
Again, you've got the idea of a musical sequence.
So I actually come now to think what I used in the music of life all those years ago, nearly 20 years ago now,
what I use there as just an alternative metaphor to selfish gene, has, as it were, got more mileage to it than I thought initially.
Absolutely.
Absolutely, Dennis.
And in fact, the harmonization, if you like, of the physiology with the behavior is significant in the way in which organisms use music to do that.
It's not, it is in itself harmony, because organisms harmonize.
And as a curious thing, whales, for example, I mean, we can think of other kinds of organisms as well, but they sing to each other across huge distances within a pod.
I mean, a pod doesn't have to be in close proximity to act as a pod, and they communicate with each other by sound, and they will sing, essentially, to each other.
They make, they phrase, they create phrases, and it's creative process.
This is what music does, of course.
They create these phrases, and I'm not going to try and mimic one in any event.
But what is interesting is that they reply to each other, but also add to the phraseology, a bit like it happens when you get extemporization in music.
There's an enormous extemporization going on in behavior in organisms, and that is significant in maintaining the integrative function of the group or the pod or the family or the community or whatever.
And I think resonance is a lovely term for it, and it's almost creating that kind of readiness, if you like, for the group to act as a group.
So that, for example, when you get a hunting, a pack of lions hunting as a pack, whatever is going on there is in harmony.
Each is anticipating the behavior of the other within the pack, within the pack, within the troop, in their hunting behavior.
There will be one that will go for the jugular, as it were, another that will go to the back, another which will hassle at the legs, another that will hassle at some other vital organ system, and so on.
And it's extraordinary looking at that harmonious kind of structure within it, and it's a bit like, you know, a major piece of a symphonic work.
It's also the case when you look at the opposite, too, which is looking at the way the herd behaves to the presence of a troop of lions.
There is an alertness, a readiness, a kind of a communication going on between the members of the herd, and the lions also are feeling for which of them is not actually functioning sufficiently well within that harmony.
And they will go, if they can, for that stray, because they don't want to risk their lives going up against a massive great big bull who could harm them.
And so, first, they'll prefer to hunt as a pack if they can, although they will hunt singly.
And, but equally, the herd know that there is a way to defend themselves as a herd.
You know, birds create the most extraordinary shapes and patterns.
There's so much that we still don't understand about what is going, shoals of fish acting as a shoal of fish.
It's extraordinarily the case that they are acting as one.
And we humans, I think, do it as well, sometimes to a disadvantage in the sense that it's so easy for us to act as a pack, in a sense.
It's very alluring.
It relieves you of an individual responsibility, of individual fear and hate and so on, and you act as a pack.
And as a pack, you can become extraordinarily dangerous.
One to each other as well, it seems to me, worries me immensely.
I hate being part of herds, if you like.
I don't like that herd instinct, but there's something to be learned from it.
And I think it's also how politics can influence our behavior in a way as well.
We want to be part of a herd.
We want to be accepted.
And so there's a psychological element to the music as well, Dennis, that is not always as beautiful.
And I see that within this niche of this podcast, when you see the different thinkers, the minds, and you can almost tell when, once they get into a philosophical mindset or a headspace regarding their theory of consciousness, it's very difficult for them to get out of it.
That sort of herd mentality gets you.
And then you fight for that value or that belief throughout your entire career, perhaps, without looking back.
So it's very interesting to see how this even plays a role within academia, because it's a big part of our lives.
It is indeed.
And it's very difficult as an academic.
You know, we're trained to be critical, but we're fearful of the criticism.
It's a very strange dynamic.
There is so, I mean, people often say, why are you saying this now?
And it's a damn good question.
And I think one of the reasons is because we're free to do so.
That freedom doesn't exist for many, many, many academics in different parts of the world.
That freedom can be extraordinarily restricted.
And as students coming through, they will experience dogma.
And they will experience also scientists and academics having to operate within those dogmas.
And that is extremely difficult.
We find very often that we are, we can be profoundly misunderstood.
And our position can be misused, misapplied.
We worry about that quite a bit.
Because of the reasons that I've said, which is that not all academics are in a position of freedom, if you like, to critique.
But it is all what we are doing, really.
We don't, I don't think we ever set out to create another dogma, really.
I mean, we suffered under dogma.
You know, when genetics gained hold as a primary causal, it was inevitable that money started being diverted to looking for those causes and looking for the golden bullet, if you like,
that was going to help us understand disease in a way that would produce inconceivable solutions to the problems of human health.
And it was at the expense of systems work.
And because if you, if you do believe that genes are primarily causal, then inevitably politicians in particular are going to look for easy solutions and they're going to look for, that's where they're going to be best investing their money.
And we're trying to get across to people that what you need to do in academic life is to fund the thinkers, to critique, to ensure that you've always got people at the edges that are showing that variability,
that are challenging the central dogma, if you like, that is, that is prevalent.
So we never set out to introduce another dogma.
We don't have another dogma.
I mean, we have ideas that we hold precious, which is the fact that, I mean, you know, I don't know whether you can call free will a dogma.
Maybe you can, but I prefer that dogma, because without free will, you can't challenge dogma.
So I prefer the dogma of free will to the dogma of determinism.
And I can ask, I would ask those determinists, if you like, who don't believe in free will and think it's an illusion.
I'd ask this question, why are you telling me that?
You know, I mean, they're telling me in order to influence my behavior or my thoughts.
They don't like the fact that I really sincerely believe that we have a reasonably large degree of free will.
I think we have to have, otherwise we can't be adaptable enough to survive as humans.
It reminds me, I posted a, I just posted a clip a few days ago for an interview I had with Dom Chomsky.
And I asked him about free will and he said, everybody, just like Coyne in one of your quotes,
says, irrespective of what we believe, everybody acts as if we have freedom of the will.
So there's no point in denying freedom of the will because of that.
If we're always going to act in this way, then most certainly it doesn't really matter philosophically.
No, and we assume, and we make the assumption that we each have free will.
And we do that, of course we do it, because our whole judicial system is based on the fact that people have freedom to act in different kinds of ways.
And if you choose to act malevolently, then you're responsible for acting malevolently.
Without free will, you wouldn't be responsible for it.
I mean, you'd be a self-driving car.
And if you had an accident, then you'd have to find something wrong with the machine.
Rather than the fact that you made a judgment based on your wishes, your hopes and fears and loves and hates.
And, you know, and you killed that person because, quite frankly, you didn't like them and you got in your way and and so on.
And yet we have strange kind of devices called morals and ethics and behavior that we shouldn't behave like that.
And so we start imposing them as much as possible on each other.
And we do that because we know that people do have choices.
So, yes, I find, I mean, in any case, even if we accepted it as an illusion, it's a fantastic illusion.
I'd go with it all the time.
I mean, I'd rather have that illusion than not.
And what do they mean by an illusion?
They mean that it doesn't really exist.
But then I go back.
Why are you telling me this?
They're telling me it because they know damn well, actually, that the illusion matters.
Is the illusion is free will.
I mean, if it's an illusion, it exists.
Okay.
They may, my, I can, I can acknowledge to them.
Okay.
You, you can have it if you like, call it an illusion.
You only have to call it an illusion because you, you, you can't understand how something immaterial can influence something that's material.
I find it fascinating.
I mean, I see, I see two brothers and one perhaps looking at a microscope, looking at neural cells.
The other one looking at maybe the SA node, looking at all these action potentials in different parts of the body, physiologically, obviously, all intertwined at some point.
One looking at EEGs, one looking at ECGs, and then somehow you guys managed to almost develop a, like a hive mind together.
And it's very inseparable.
You can sort of see how one of you can think of something and the other finishes the other person's sentence.
Do you guys disagree fundamentally on anything regarding this field?
I don't think we do because we don't, we're never trying to establish a dogma.
I think what we've done is over a period of, what is it now, getting on for about 20 years of interaction in a sort of fairly rigorous way, publishing papers together after all is pretty rigorous.
We've, we've, we've come to hone a lot of our own rough edges in how we interact, but that tells me that you, you need academic communities that can interact in this kind of way, because that is the way in which we get closer to an analysis, which we can defend, because a group of people can think of many more reasons
why one might be wrong about something than a single person can, I don't think it's possible to be a really good thinker, academically, alone.
That's my explanation for what has happened.
If people interact over a long period of time, there is some kind of honing away of the minor differences that might have existed.
And you see it in other communities too, monastic communities do the same, they, they, they, well, particularly some traditions like meditative traditions, they're continually hacking away at each other's so-called misperceptions of the world.
And they even have sutras to remind them the fact, you think you understand the world, no, you don't, that's the diamond sutra, you think you understand the nature of the person, no, you don't, that's the heart sutra.
And so you can go on with the different ways in which it has been expressed, but there is a strong sense, I think, to how long people interact together to the process by which you come to be able to finish each other's sentences.
Because we've, as it were, danced and created a harmonization of the way we think.
I think that may be an illusion of another kind.
It may be we should have a third person doing this with us, or a fifth, or a sixth, or a 20th, you know, but, but the group is, groupthink matters is what we're really saying.
It is also the case that if one or other of us comes up with an idea at the boundary, as it were, at the edge, and, I mean, one might think, gosh, you know, should I really say that?
I mean, should I really go there?
I mean, is it too, is it too far?
We would bounce that off each other, in a sense, I mean, you know, and, and build on it, rather than reject it, see where it goes.
And if you do that often enough, you begin to understand how the other mind works.
It's also the case that we bring to the table completely different experiences.
That's right.
And I don't, I mean, many might, many people might not know this, might not understand that, because they might think, well, we're the same family.
But we had completely different trajectories in life.
And those trajectories mattered in how, what we brought to the table.
I mean, I kind of had an introduction to philosophy before I had an introduction to science.
I had no idea I'd be a scientist.
And I, I mean, I left school when I was 15.
I grew up in a one-parent family on a council estate.
And I left school at 15.
And my school headmaster said of me in my penultimate school report,
that he could see no reason, I'm quoting now,
no reason why public money should be wasted on the attempted education of this boy.
That's harsh.
So you see, I left school.
Well, I couldn't see any reason either.
And I, I don't, I didn't want to stay there, because they couldn't see in me the potential, actually, to be fair.
I mean, there were one or two of them, my teachers, who could.
And so I left school, and I left school very young.
I did not know then that I would become an academic.
I didn't know, certainly didn't know I would become a scientist of any kind.
And my first interests were in politics, philosophy, and economics.
When I say my first interests, because that's not quite true.
I mean, you know, as they developed, my, my instinct was to tend towards philosophy, actually.
And at one time, I thought I might study if I could get into university.
In those days, back in the 1960s, and early 70s, and it was extremely difficult to get into university.
If you'd left school in the circumstances I left in, very few people in the United Kingdom went to university.
About 6%, a very tiny percentage of those that had qualifications went to university.
I mean, we hadn't experienced then the sort of massive expansion in higher education, which is wonderful, incidentally.
You know, the more we have higher education, the better it seems to me.
As long as it's doing the right thing, which is creating people who think, and not willing to think outside the box.
And protect them, because that's one of the other crucial things about universities.
So I was outside the box, really physically outside the box for a long period of time.
And one, one, for some reason, I read, I started reading Karl Popper, for example, which in a sense was one of my early introductions to science.
Because I was fascinated by his approach to scientific thinking, and methodology, and conjectures and refutations, and so on.
And how did we unravel problems?
But I was also fascinated by his concepts of open society, of open systems.
I didn't know then, incidentally, that what he was going on to say was very similar to the kinds of things that we were saying.
I had no idea then.
I don't think even he had any idea then, when I first, I was back in the 1960s, you see, late 60s.
And I started reading that.
So I came, I came at this, in a sense, timed with an interest in philosophy, rather than with science.
When I eventually went to university in the 1970s, I went to study zoology.
And the reason for that was because I got so fascinated and wanted to understand how living systems worked.
But I came to it, you see, because I felt the need to do that.
I needed to understand it.
It wasn't so much that I had necessarily a love of zoology or whatever.
It's just, I had a, I wanted to understand how this system worked.
And when I did so, when I started studying zoology at Manchester University, this was at the very moment when things were beginning to pivot towards a more gene-centric view.
And I saw more behavior being explained by maintaining genes in gene pools and so on.
I actually, even as a student, repeated some of Richard Dawson's experiments that he did when he was doing his PhD.
And then not long after, he actually had done them and so on.
And looking at bird behavior and things and pecking regimes and things and interpreting everything in terms of peck, peck, peck, changing angle, peck, peck, peck, all very algorithm driven, you see.
And this dissatisfied me inherently because one of the reasons I'd gone in to study living systems is because I wanted to really understand reason.
Why did they behave like that?
Why did they make that decision?
How do they make decisions?
And, you know, because I'd come at it from a completely different angle, if you like.
So what I'm saying is, and I'm very, I try and shorten what I'm saying.
After giving us, we didn't come to each other in, by sitting around a family table.
I mean, in the end, we did, as it were, but we didn't, in that, it wasn't a natural sort of thing that, you know.
And curiously, while you were encountering the gene-centric explanations in Manchester University, I was examining Richard Dawkins' thesis.
Yes.
It's a strange interweaving, one thing after another.
It's, it's, um, Dennis, at that, what was yours like?
What did you bring to the table?
And at what point did you guys sort of come together and coalesce in such a beautiful way?
It is the last decade or two that has really seen the coming together flourish.
Um, but there have been other things that encouraged it.
We, we both like music.
We both, even sing and play guitars.
And we both have, um, have acquired also through creating a music group together, um, an interest there too.
And so, it's, it's a complex, uh, pas de deux, as it were.
It's a dance.
And it's had many aspects which have come together the more it's gone on.
I think that's the best way I can describe it.
But as Ray said earlier on, our initial trajectories were miles apart.
There was no, no foreseeing what was going to happen.
There were one or two events that one might look back on.
I mean, one was, uh, a, a, a debate that just shortly after Selfish Gene was published at Balliol College.
And I, I came way down from Edinburgh.
I, by that time I was now starting to do my PhD in Edinburgh.
And I, I came all the way down from Edinburgh to Oxford to this debate.
Um, uh, uh, and I think it was Anthony Kenny, wasn't it, Dennis?
I think it was, it was part of that.
And Anthony Kenny was the two philosophers and Anthony Kenny was absolutely brilliant.
And he asked Richard after he'd presented his case for the Selfish Gene and his, uh, his theory.
He said, look, I want to know the following.
If all I knew of the English language was its alphabet, I would not be entitled and would not be able to understand Shakespeare.
Now, I was listening very carefully because I was chairing this meeting, but Richard then said, well, I'm not a philosopher.
I'm just a scientist.
I'm only interested in truth.
And that lost him.
You did.
That was the break point.
I don't think he knows that, but I broke with him there because what Tony as a philosopher was getting at is
that if all, you know, is the sequence, you cannot know its meaning.
I, I happen to have almost fluent reading of Hangul's script, which is Korean script, but I don't have a command of Korean language.
And I would never be able to understand a play or a poem in Korean without a considerable amount of explanation.
And that illustrates the point.
And he missed the point.
He didn't even see what Tony was getting at.
And I did.
And, and, and, you know, that, that, that was so influential on my own thinking, uh, about all this.
Uh, I, it, it, it just resonates in my mind, just listening to Anthony Kenny make that point.
And then the surprise and shock at Richard's reply, um, to it.
I then later experienced a similar kind of dismissal of philosophy.
To me, that was an example of how philosophical thinking can be so helpful in unraveling a problem.
Um, uh, and, um, because there's a facility of saying that something is like something, uh, and then saying, but wouldn't you say this about that, as it were.
And it's that preciseness that I was, it was, I found it very impressive.
And, uh, and, uh, and I thought it just so fundamentally destroyed the notion of, of the gene centric view.
And so it was very influential that they're so curiously, if you, if you like, you probably discovered something very interesting here, which is that I think that, that meeting at, uh, Balea was significant, was probably the term of what subsequently came to be, uh, our, our, our sort of collaboration.
That's a good point, Ray, that's a good point, and it's come out of this particular discussion.
Yeah.
Exactly.
So it's served a very useful purpose for us too.
But I'm, I have to say, I'm beginning to watch the clock because I was lecturing all day today and I've been going since about five o'clock this morning.
There are, there are even limits to what philosophers and scientists can do.
So we're in your hands, Tevin.
When, when, how are you going to wrap this up?
I was just enjoying listening to you guys reminisce.
It is beautiful.
Sorry, guys.
I got caught up in the motion there as well.
Okay.
Let's, let's, let's wrap this up a little, guys.
The one thing I wanted to ask just before we close is, um, I was speaking to Professor Terence Deacon and Michael Levin recently about teleodynamics and teleophobia within science and philosophy.
A lot of philosophers and scientists hate talking about this.
They hate it.
They absolutely hate it.
Yes.
On the purpose, meaning of this universe of life and, uh, final thoughts from your side, Dennis, and then, Ray, you can end as well.
Just briefly, the break occurred between Wallace and Darwin way back in 1866.
Um, Darwin was utterly shocked when, uh, Wallace decided he would go on a different route completely from Charles Darwin.
Charles Darwin was working on his idea that the peacock was really trying to impress the PN and that was an intentional conscious choice.
It's in the 1871 book, I quoted almost verbatim from it, Wallace went off in the opposite direction and said, no, um, Charles, natural selection explains everything.
Full stop.
That's the break.
That's where purpose was eliminated.
And I have one statement to add to that, which is, I don't think you can fully understand life, uh, by excluding reason, uh, and, um, I think that that is such an important ingredient.
We tend to dismiss, I, I, I remember a discussion, I, I, I, I won't remember, I won't say names, um, with a colleague who was shocked by my interest in philosophy and by my interest in the significance of psychology.
Um, we create our niche as well as adapt to it.
All organisms do that niche creation is a fundamental in the way life works.
A major part of that is the psychological aspect.
We've referred to some of it in terms of the way things work in synchrony, the way things work in harmony and so on.
That is, is so significant to our wellbeing, to our health and wellbeing and understanding how things can go wrong with the system.
With health consequences.
That if we eliminate reason, uh, it leaves a void of understanding for humans to cope with what it is that having to cope with, which is this extraordinarily difficult psychosocial environment that we have to be adapted to and adaptable within.
And, and that is increasingly difficult because it changes so rapidly that it, we find it harder and harder to find the normative within which we're going to work.
Ethically, this is extremely difficult.
Ethically, this is extremely difficult for us, um, because, um, as we gain more reason, more understanding, if you like, the more we challenge those very things that constrain our behaviour, constrain us in the, in a, in a, in a, in, at that psychosocial level.
And provide grounding, if you like, things that we don't have to question or, you know, accept as given, and those things that are accepted as given are getting, are now becoming smaller and smaller and smaller.
Which makes it very hard, I think, for people to be so easily grounded.
Uh, and, and that creates a psychological problem.
So it's, it's, it's no surprise to me that so many people experience, certainly in, uh, the Western world, um, so many people experience some kind of mental problem, uh, in life at some point, have some kind of breakdown, even whether they don't realise it.
I mean, I think many people go through, uh, mental health issues without realising that that's been a major problem to them.
Having stable relationships becomes harder and harder, uh, and, and working with others becomes difficult too.
Uh, and, um, so, so it, it matters.
Reason matters.
So the psychology, that, that level, if you like, the psychosocial level of causation is so significant, um, particularly in, uh, an organism like us.
That uses it linguistically.
We use it to express ourselves, to understand ourselves.
Our, our, our, um, dependence on cultural transmission of information is as strong as our dependence on anything that might be regarded as genetic.
Um, who we are, our identity matters.
Uh, and, um, so sometimes that is challenged.
Um, it can breed hate or it can breed love.
It can breed all sorts of, create all sorts of problems.
And so maintaining integrity within that psychosocial, I'm going to call it space, but you know, really, I'm not wanting to create a kind of dichotomy like that.
But this psychosocial space, it can be extraordinarily difficult.
Um, and it's a challenge, I think, to humanity, um, at the political level, it's a challenge because I think that we, we are getting to the point where even, even in what we say to each other, we can challenge the foundations of it in terms of reality in a way that perhaps we wouldn't have done in the past.
Mm.
Uh, so what is truth becomes a fundamental question.
Um, and that's, uh, I, I think, uh, perhaps a nice point to end if it is a philosophical question, but curiously, it's a fundamental, I mean, what is truth on social media for heaven's sake?
Yeah, it's the relativistic view of it all.
And this, the way people are approaching this becomes very, very fishy territory at this point.
But, but gentlemen, this has been such a pleasure for me.
Thank you so much.
It's an honor and privilege to chat to both of you, big fan of both of your works for many years.
And, uh, I hope that in the future we can discuss and dissect certain papers and books in detail and, and heart and like focus and hone in to specific topics.
And it's been such a pleasure.
Thank you so much for joining me.
You've been a terrific host, Tevin.
Thank you very much, Dennis.
Well, you've made that, you've made us think of some things that we probably hadn't focused on.
Absolutely, yes.
Yes.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
I really appreciate it.
Okay.
Well, bye-bye all.

Cheers, guys.
Okay.
