um so my pleasure to introduce peter uh who i've known since 2007 uh from the senate institute um
you know peter is currently spends his time between well i guess you retired from university
of connecticut but he still spends half his year there and half his year in vienna at the complex
complexity science hub um peter is you know revolutionizing history by turning it into a
science and i think he'll tell you something about that yeah thank you don so um let me explain the
title i'm here actually at the end of this whole week i've been promoting my book i'll send it
around and i forgot to say i've read most of this book this is a really excellent book it completely
changed my view about the current situation in the world so sorry you can reorder the book is coming
out next tuesday so uh you can pre-order in uh you know this one or even audio version so end times is
the title of the book including dynamics is what we call this particular site that don't uh mentioned
cleo uh is um reviews the greek news of history and uh so that's where the name comes from all right um
so um what what i plan to do uh is to give you a more academic talk uh uh of the science under my
the book the book is popular there's not a single equation or a graph there so i'll have some graphs here
in my talk all right all right uh let's see oh did you click or simply oh that's big sorry
now try okay
that worked um all right um so the i started the story in 2010 uh when um i published uh
a forecast in nature uh about the next decade where i uh said that the next decade is likely to
be a period of growing instability in the united states and western europe um that would be during
the 2020s so um what happened to this um forecast is that uh 10 years later i and my colleague
andrey koretaev we have revisited it um and it essentially turned out to be uh in um uh essentially
accurate i mean uh we we submitted this article in uh january 2020 right precisely 10 years after the
forecast and uh during the time when it went through the review of course old hell broke was
so it was obvious by by the uh by the summer of 2020 it was obvious that things were happening but
you actually could see it happening even um before in the decade before so here we are at the point of
the forecast this is there too uh what i'm showing here i'm showing here um anti-government demonstrations
but you can do the same thing for violent riots so uh there is incidence for five uh largest uh countries
um in um uh democratic capitalist countries and things has been have been declining and by 2010
everybody thought i was crazy but um i was not crazy i was i was quite uh uh ready to be wrong because
this was really it it was a scientific prediction uh you can't really predict future you know details
all right you cannot predict whether more than 10 days ahead right and human uh social systems are
uh complex systems which uh we'll be talking about in a minute so uh they are not necessarily amenable to
very precise uh predictions but um as i argue some features of uh social uh human social systems change
relatively slowly and are relatively predictable right so that's what i will be capitalizing on
but mostly i was interested uh in scientific prediction we had a theory and i wanted to know
whether the theory um could capture the reality in any way and so what we have to see what we see here
we can see a trend reversal you have declining trend of uh uh let's say anti-government demonstrations
and am i showing you uh no yeah well there's a similar graph for riots uh for violent uh riots and in fact
in fact at this point uh people like steven pinker for example uh they were proclaiming that you know
the violence is declining things are doing well max rose and roser would be showing you how uh life on
the earth is getting better all the time and uh and there you know um uh come i and say things are
actually gonna get um you know it's not uh going to be linear uh decline of violence as uh as predicted
by alternative theories so this was a scientific prediction to see um whether um the theory that i
and my colleagues have worked on uh does a better job uh than uh uh predicting uh out of sample data than
alternative ideas um and um of course so uh maybe yeah okay yes i'll just use the arrow yes digital
it's always better than analog all right so and then um by uh january of 2021 it won pretty much
everybody uh agreed that uh something uh real is uh going on all right so what i want to do is um
in my talk is to uh try to explain to you at least give you the highlights of the model from which the
this forecast came
and four things that i want to do is first of all um make the point that human societies can be uh uh
analyzed as uh linear dynamical systems and i'll talk about some important uh concepts like the wealth
pump uh and a little of production and then we end up with a crisis and after that all right so uh
let's start by going back in history and uh taking take a look at um dynamics of um human societies over
the long term so here's for example i'm using data from peterim sarokhan who essentially counted uh the
numbers of different outbreaks of the numbers of different outbreaks of violence such as uh peasant
uprisings uh um uh inter-elite uh you know uh uh uh infighting uh lethal infighting um
coups and uh overthrows and civil wars uh and things like that so it is a semi-quantitative um
uh uh index and um it is resolved at 25 uh uh so uh at uh time step here is 25 years and quarter of
the century what you see here is there at some period sometimes century or here in a century or uh
uh or uh uh or longer when violence is uh quite um quite uh low and then there is this period of
enhanced violence and they this uh period of uh of uh instability have been obvious the historians uh
as a result of which they've got names so we have the the general crisis of the 17th century
uh the late medieval crisis and so on and so forth the other thing you notice is that uh the crisis
seemed to be jacked because the the time step was 25 years there is seems like a roughly 50 year or
something like that during the crisis period it's slightly differently when they go back and forth
like you can see it here too this is the rome so also uh also um similar data to uh sarah's index
um all right um and uh here you you see actually transitions typically these are essentially by the
way end times i did not come up with this title myself um but it was always the publishers who do that
but it's uh you know i'm growing just the acceptance because it seems to be connected with people by the way
end times these are end times right republic ends but end times are also times of new beginnings
so and republicans the principate uh principal starts principate uh period of uh ancient rome
ends the dominant period uh so don't think of this uh uh end times as necessarily very um
you know sometimes they're dias i'm not something it's not we'll talk more at the end i'll talk more
um uh concordatively about uh that um something else i wanted to mention in this
relation okay you know come back to me so um these are not really cycles uh but uh because uh the
periods uh um are variable quite variable and uh uh but uh and in different societies this is the
dynamics could be faster i mean in the book i actually talk about uh one particular factor
that explains why sometimes cycles only one century long or boom bust dynamics or a typical uh one uh
why in some societies the typical um time scale is about a century and in societies like this it's
typical scale about two or three centuries so there are some uh good reasons for uh explaining the uh
typical uh typical uh time scales all right uh but it there seems to be some idea of systemness
and um and if you go to uh batteries of data now this is the data that i have collected myself
for the united states it's published as a u.s political violence database and here i am
uh collecting data on lethal rights so at least uh at least one individual had to be killed uh lynchings uh
terrorism and then an overall uh dynamic so um american civil war is of course here uh but uh it was
just two orders of magnitude greater than anything here but you can see that in fact um the smaller scale
events provided to you with a good uh idea that something might break um by the time you get uh
so starting in very uh low uh instability period uh called the this is called the year of good
feelings by um the historians of united states and then around 1830 things start to get bad and in a
variety in the variety in the variety of this uh uh types of uh violence collective violence and then
of course um the civil war happens so uh what you see here uh you see here this is uh here's a period
of stability this is another the second year of good feelings that post-war all right interrupted by
the late 60s 1970s peak which did not get sustained but overall you see uh this is what
uh this is uh similar to those secular cycles that we saw in the previous graph and also you see
here the 50-year spikes all right so this was published uh i did this before my book that i
published in 2016 uh when we didn't know what would happen in 2020 of course now we are we um we are quite
uh quite uh quite um it's quite clear all right so um uh so what my claim is that we are uh looking at uh
uh complex dynamics here with at least two periodicities superimposed on each other there's a long
secular cycle um right here and then there there is this 50-year uh or uh peaks on on on that i
won't be talking much about uh 50 here at least we can talk about it later i just don't have time
i'll be more interested in why do we have this uh long waves okay
all right so my uh claim is that uh that we can study complex human societies as dynamical systems
which means that uh we need to uh uh represent them as a uh as a set of parts that are interacting
amongst themselves their uh feedback loops uh uh perhaps going in um uh various directions and the
approach that um i and my colleagues uh have adopted was that we can represent uh the uh the state space
here by first of all focusing on the general population and its characteristics uh on the elites uh the
state and uh how uh instability uh how instability changes in time as a result of various uh interactions
all right um so that's uh that's what i was trying to do so what i am planning to do now
uh is um to to walk through uh some of these feedback loops all right i'll go like this all right
and uh try to uh give you a story actually so how uh i see the dynamics unfold why do we get into these
these enzymes what are the uh drivers and uh how they all interact and this is um a more holistic
way of looking at societies than just econ just economics or just political science uh
or just sociology it's uh because uh all those things are important that's what
leo dynamics tries to do is to um include um uh everything that's important but no more than that
seriously okay so let's start with the population uh well-being and here i'm showing you the
economic aspect of well-being here we're looking at real wages so these are wages adjusted for
inflation for two classes of workers unskilled and manufacturing and what we see here is a very
interesting dynamics so we start in 1927 and up until late 1970s very robust growth of real wages i
mean we get to four times for manufacturing workers who are actually uh their real wages increased uh
fourfold and slightly less for uh for unskilled workers and then boom some kind of a break point
happens and then we see stagnation um or stagnation or even decline uh in uh in fact if we're uh when
the fact for as skilled wages at this point to uh to uh 2012 we are they're worse off than at the peak
and they have come up a little bit now down again because of inflation in the last uh year so um what
um uh what is happening here is that if you think you've seen similar graphs where you see the um uh
productivity of american workers which keeps going up and it just does that's like this right um and the
wages that first keep uh place with productivity then boom is tough and so all of that uh extra uh uh
through through all those fruits of economic growth above they had to go somewhere
and so one way to look at this is to scale wages not in relation to uh baskets or consumables
especially because um uh the estimates of um um of uh inflation get really bad when you get into the
19th uh century so let's exclude that let's take the gdp per capita in nominal uh and wages in nominal in
nominal dollars uh and divide the wage uh scale the wage by gdp per capita and then you can because you
have data going back uh for more than 200 years uh this is what we'll do so the thin line is the year
to year uh changes and the thick line is simply a smooth trend so what we see here right from roughly
speaking 1910 to 1960 early 1960s there is a this is the increasing uh part of the graph yeah why is
the uh original light so wobbly now why is the original what yes i didn't quite see why it would be so wobbly
straight up uh i mean you smoothed it oh because there is a lot of types of you know for example here's
wobbliness this is uh the great depression here then um uh this is the long depression uh and so on
so there is a uh what i'm doing i'm looking at sort of uh what's happening over a period of more
than 200 years all right but uh the economics were quite uh especially back here uh it's uh there's also
also possibly measurement noise which probably gets worse all right so but overall um um we see this
is the um you know the civil war um um effect on uh wages because of inflation rapid inflation uh and uh
well let's not get in let's not get bogged down in details here all right so this part corresponds to
what we saw before so this is the part where the wages were growing robustly and essentially what
you see that workers were gaining they were gaining a greater share of uh gdp as uh during this period
and then something happened they uh started declining
and um this is the uh this is for me this is for unscaled labor but similar
um uh dynamics for uh for um manufacturing labor and here is uh you see here here remember this is
the period of good feelings again the workers were gaining um income uh salary faster than the economy
and then um it just went down uh and sort of associated at this low level before resuming growth
so um so um so we see this uh interesting boom and bust type of dynamics again i don't want to call it
cycles because they're not very precise in uh period and so on but we see this uh up and down up and
down two cycles so very interesting so what's happening here is that um uh that uh gdp grows but the workers
get a smaller small share where where does it go well the government was getting uh pretty much the same
uh chunk of gdp of gdp about between 20 and 22 percent plus minus one percent right so all of this
went to their uh economic elites their owners and managers of uh corporations
uh so i i call it uh uh the wealth uh pump uh because the wealth uh pump is essentially it's a
perverse wealth pump it's not a nice thing at all it's a nice thing if you are an economic elite
obviously but for the majority of the population it's not a great thing because um uh the wealth from
the uh ninety percent of the population gets pumped to the one percent uh or even uh even higher all
right and um why um why does this happen and we see this wealth pump actually operating all the way
uh through the uh last five thousand years since the complex since complex human societies organized
the states arose in mesopotamia in egypt about five thousand years ago first of all for ever anywhere
we have data the goals of this integrative and disintegrative phases as you saw for the france and
the rome are a few size ago that's one thing and secondly they are these uh integrative and
these integrative phases are associated um with a wealth pump which which doesn't which is shut down
uh during the integrative phase and then towards the end of integrative phase uh suddenly starts
operating in the past uh in the reasons how why the wealth starts upgrading can be quite various
it depends on the society so for example in many um in medieval societies yeah it the wealth pump was
turned on by coercion uh peasants would be um uh and served or even enslaved um and that would be that
would be how the uh elites would extract um you know um uh income and wealth from them um later on uh we
see more economic ways uh so for example in the american um situation uh uh with uh this
uh we see uh a huge labor over supply developing during this period partly because of the movement
of uh people from rural areas which like connecticut where i live now got completely overpopulated by 1850
and people were moving some people were in uh west but many of them went to the eastern eastern seaboard and
there was a massive immigration from uh europe at that point as a result of which um the uh economic
um laws of supply and demand depressed the price of labor and that was actually encouraged by the capitalists
but um the more general um explanation of why this happens is that um it's really a
important decision to do with decisions taken by the elites all right because during the integrative uh
periods when uh uh the societies enjoy internal peace and order all right just keep notice that i'm
talking about the absence of internal wars external wars essentially it was a constant um uh and
unfortunately still uh are uh we are talking about what's happening um inside societies um and um uh what
happens to the elites is that um they um are tempted to uh reconfigure the economy in their own uh favor
so um why this happens is uh because they keep right uh because they have the power
so counter-arguments what you're saying is that you could argue that inequality is the driver of
wealth and has been backed from mesopotamian times and actually if you include the wealth of
poor people across the world in the same period that the average worker in america was losing out versus
the elites being workers in china and in numerical terms they even outnumbered the workers from america
the net net a huge number were driven out of poverty in that same period so yes it's bad in america but
overall the inequality is a driver of wealth it's not the other way around the person okay i'm gonna
have a question so two points first of all um my model is state-centric um and the reason we have to
do it this way because uh different countries go through these cycles at different times china for
example had a century of humiliation from 1850s to through 19 early 1960s all right and uh so china
is um right now in an integrated period and they are bringing um you know uh they are reducing poverty
and so on and so forth but why would you want to average uh this over the whole globe where different
parts of the world are in different phases of the cycle that would be my first argument um and the
second argument um um that you raised which i uh um i forgot uh um oh yeah inequality what's inequality
um uh how can you look around how do you measure uh inequality in fact it turns out there's good uh
um research research research shows that uh people um for people uh even quantitative people uh it's very
difficult for them to gauge the degree of inequality in their society the gini index what the hell does it
mean um yeah people are uh uh usually underestimating inequality all right um and so the only way you can
get inequality is by collecting a lot of data but um if you cannot see it right then how could it affect
human behavior so what i argue is that what affects human behavior is uh first of all immiseration so
when you grow up um in your household of your parents this uh sets uh some idea about your view what
should be what is the right way of uh income right and then um if uh during all these periods
when uh two or three generations go and each generation is doing better their parents people
sort of get uh used to that but now we are in a situation where uh people who uh grew up uh in the
1990s for example uh uh who were born in 1990s their lives are um worse off than um uh than the people
than their parents i in my book i do a surgery on this uh so you can you can see the details uh of
that is because this is especially uh has a big effect on the 60 percent of american population who
have uh who don't have college degrees maybe let's save the questions i don't want to run through the
talks so they're talking happy to stay as long as you guys have questions um afterward so what i'm
arguing is that inequality is a useful proxy for things getting um uh out of whack but in um my
thinking uh the drivers actually are the immiseration because that makes large swaths of population
discontented and also increases what you call mass mobilization potential i'll talk about that in a
league and a little production about which i am about to to talk so um essentially um the uh this
is this is actually a pretty good description in the united states uh by the 1970s uh the uh selfish
segments of american elites have uh gained power and uh started reconfiguring the economy uh in their
favor it took many ways for example uh you know taking the uh taking power again away from workers
uh stopping uh not increasing the minimum wage so in real terms it was increasing they uh uh stopped uh
you know they decreased taxes on themselves and so on there was a variety of ways and what that did that
turn on the uh wealth pump all right so uh in popular remiseration is uh uh defined uh in uh in uh terms of uh
decreasing relative terms because you are comparing your uh well economic well-being to um to uh the previous
generation but it also has a strong effect on other measures psychological and biological measures of
currently being this is very uh well known the deaths of despair all right uh so uh this is uh from uh
from case and deaton great book uh actually recommended so you can see especially uh they started uh increasing
uh yeah it's very sensitive so yeah it started uh increasing around 1960s and in fact this uh follows
a little bit those ups and downs of uh real wages and then really took off after two thousand um and
it's a result of the nation of things and um uh and uh case indeed and make a great uh argument uh explaining
why this happens this is this is what immiseration uh looks like all right
and of course um i i was uh i started giving talks about this in fact uh don't sorry uh in the talk
in 2007 which was very early version and i was saying that okay yes i see the trends turned around in
late 1970s but unlike uh previous historical societies that i started you know life expectancy has not uh
uh uh you know become worse because we after all live in the post mouthless uh world yeah here it is
post mouthless world in fact uh um average expectancy life expectancy started decreasing in uh 2016.
all right uh that's when uh and uh and it's they are still uh in 2022 they're still way below
uh you know that it's just it came back it bounced up a little bit but still we have lost like um 30 years
of uh progress all right okay so uh so now the second uh let's talk about the elites who are the elites
all right simply put it's the small proportion of the population who concentrate social power in their
hands so think about you know uh uh military nobility in medieval england of france you know uh the
mandarin class in uh imperial china and a proverbial one percent in the united states although that's
a bit more complex i'll talk about that uh uh later uh uh the elites in the united states all right
um so when the wealth pump gets turned on for a while things are really teaching for the uh elites
because they uh experience essentially a golden age although in reality all those historical golden
ages typically are gilded ages because as the elites are doing great the population is in fact getting more
more work immiserated all right um and um okay and um that results uh depending on the social uh
arrangements that results either in higher higher rates of biological reproduction but more importantly
it's typically higher rates of upward uh social mobility uh so for example in the 19th century uh what
happened was that uh as the wealth pump started operating many energetic um and uh skilled mechanics
would start their shops all right and because uh labor was very cheap it would be quite easy for them
to bootstrap themselves into the millionaire class and that's what we see we see suddenly uh over like 20
years between 1830 and 1850s uh the numbers of millionaires increased by like tenfold
in the united states all right and uh this is the same thing in um uh america in more recent america so
now you have much better data this is uh the percent of household with net worth exceeding there
um the net worth here is uh uh is uh adjusted for inflation so we comparing the same thing what you see
here for um you know very wealthy so 10 million or more um the proportion of them in the population
has increased by uh seven eight uh forward right so actually the the the numbers of them increased
more than tenfold but of course the population has also grown by 40 percent over this period of time
so so this is the effect of the wealth pump you suddenly start getting a lot a lot more wealthy uh
people the whole society becomes um top heavy this is what happened in the united states during the
19th century for example viewed the age remember was the uh result all right and so now uh this is
what happens in the let's call the second view the page it's interesting see how history repeats you
know first uh um age of good feelings second age of good feelings first view of the age second beauty
age first age of discord second age of discord uh so this uh these are certain case uh repeatable
all right so what happens now uh why does this uh okay if you don't care about workers like like
gordon gecko he doesn't care about the workers he's doing great all right um so um so maybe uh you know uh
uh uh so maybe that uh uh is uh a sustainable thing for the millionaires just to keep doing these steps
no why because uh there are two other effects the two effects on the elites
um one of them is that we have our production of uh wealthy people and many of them um decide to uh to
uh so for one of these go well but it's a dynamical system as the as you keep pumping the wealthy
eventually they overcrowd their uh their resources but more importantly since uh many of these wealthy
people um decide uh in the united states they decide to convert their wealth into political power
so of course donald trump is uh the shining example of that but then you have many millionaires michael
bloomberg you know and a few others who have uh uh successfully or unsuccessfully tried to
to to do this and uh what this does is that because the supply of power positions in politics is uh
sort of fixed right we still have hundred senators you know only one president and so on and so forth
but now you're getting uh ten times as many uh potential elite aspirants so elite wannabe's right
and so what that does is that first of all you see this clearly in the number of self-funded
companies who are called millionaires all right so uh so we see uh them increasing and also the the
greater increasing demand that drives the price of elections so we see several um signs of how this
a little production um happens and then um at certain point um what happens is that uh because we have
more and more elite aspirants is huge and more more more of them are frustrated in getting the position
so it's like a game of musical chairs right except that you keep the same ten chairs you can change that
but you bring more and more players so initially you have like a dozen players uh that's competition
that's good but they have 20 players 30 players 40 players and you can imagine the chaos that would
ensue you know um in this game so if you were to play which i don't suggest you have to play this
game with your children right what uh you know uh these children then what uh i can predict what
will happen which is why you don't want to do it so some children you figure out that um you have to
break the rules right humans unlike agents in models they actually don't necessarily follow the rules
so so if i was the child i would stop right here and wait until the music starts against brother and
other people figure it out so it will be a shock at each other and then somebody will hit me and give
the assist and so all kinds of things will uh happen so this is sort of what happened in 2016. um in
2016 we had 17 major candidates in the republican uh primaries okay um and uh uh it was just amazing
to see how they started breaking rules of course this particular individual uh was the best at breaking
rules he was breaking all the rules right and his uh and uh poll numbers were just exploding go up you
know and others tried to uh to uh to uh you know to do the same but they were just not as good at this
thing so this is the game of um aspirant cheers um in action the as a result of it is the breakdown of
social norms and institutions that uh that govern the functioning of the democratic democracies all
right um so um uh so um the wealth pump creates immiseration that's a bad thing for the majority of
people but it is not necessarily a dire thing for the stability of societies because non-elites have
really no power and they really have very little power even to overthrow governments it is a fairy
tale that revolutions happen because of discontented masses my good example since here here in uk would
be the pleasant rebellion what tyler in 1380 so there was a huge amount of discontent they were
with out there with pitchforks eventually what happened that a small group of armored uh knights
just rolled them down and slaughtered them uh you know executed what tyler and nowadays um um if you
if you were to try to rebel against the united states which i would not recommend uh the uh we have
very strong coercive apparatus fba is well staffed um and in fact fba is so effective
uh in suppressing internal uh insurrection that they essentially have to invent it uh you know as we
saw on several occasions they actually have uh fba agents suggest things to do so that they could
actually show that yes we are on the job so if you were uh essentially the rule of thumb is as soon as
a conspiracy gets like three people one of them is going to is likely to be fbi agent and so they don't
get all uh put in priesthood into prison for a long period of time so um what does it mean that
means that for stability of societies it's really the elites both the elites and the counter is so
counter these are those who are on the losing side and uh they decide to start breaking rules and
start and they can choose violent ways of doing it they start right so think uh vladimir lenin and his
both right uh think um um castro and los barbudos uh and uh um and uh and and here's a startling
startling uh way for you to think about counter is think about the um middle of 19th century the ruling
uh ruling class antebellum ruling class are the slave owners with their plantations
selling cotton primarily and the northeastern merchants who uh who send cotton overseas and bring
and uh bring uh uh finished goods from there and we have um a rising so i should end by 11 30 right
yeah or even a little before let's yeah no no i would like to have that type of questions i'm
so uh but then we have this wealth pump and suddenly we have um i forget now the numbers it's
in the book like from eight millionaires to like uh 50 millionaires in 20 years and where are those
millionaires uh they are in the north and especially northwest so they make money from
mining you know smelting uh iron uh railroads all right and they have their own champion uh a corporate
lawyer uh whose name is abraham lincoln um and essentially they uh start an insurrection uh using
the legal uh ways because lincoln gets elected um as president uh uh legally even though he gets on
the 38 percent uh of the popular vote but legally that's all good but uh the southern states
succeed and then we get there so counter elites in this case are those uh wealthy um magnates in the
north plus their uh the politicians uh with whom they are in coalition such as lincoln and so on and so
forth okay um so um so so far uh we have talking talked about two outcomes from the low spot immiseration
and all the production of wealth now the other the third and final thing i would say is in terms of
uh what the wealth pump does is that by immiserating everybody uh not everybody uh only the 98 percent
all right um uh there you create um a huge incentive for people energetic and ambitious people from the
90 percent to escape the free guarantee all right and so um how do you if you there are two routes to
power in the united states either you have wealth inherited or you might self-made or you get
credentials the best credentials of course is law degree but you have to first start getting a college
degree and so we see that you know in if in 1950 less than 15 percent of um of um uh youth went to
college nowadays it's 60 actually it was 67 a few years ago it came down a little bit so two-thirds
uh would go uh to college and i talked about advanced degrees in the united but um the natural effect of
that is that is that if you look at the expected wealth uh premium of the bachelors right so here's
1950s it's pretty good if you double essentially you're by uh 1980s these are people who are born
you know so that uh that collapses and now there is uh you know it's really uh it's not if you take on
uh debt it's really economically it's not really feasible all right so let's talk about one advanced
degree lawyers if you want to become president and you don't have wealth then the best route uh is to
go to law school and um actually you should go to uh yale law school that's uh it's not here if you
want to become prime minister you go to oxford all right uh in the states states you go to
yale law school like harvard that's not so not so bad either all right princeton but you want to go
there so uh uh uh so this is what essentially happened uh this graph shows the enrollment per
100 000 population in um uh law school and this uh is the number of lawyers per 1000 population so
you see it's pretty flat uh the number of lawyers was growing together with population which makes
sense right the more population you have the more legal services and then around 1970s it goes like this
um and so we have exactly the same thing now we have not only too many wealthy people competing for
the limited number of uh political positions now you have huge numbers of lawyers competing for uh
fixed number positions now this is the most uh uh remarkable uh graph that i found so if you look
at this is this shows the distribution of uh annual salaries in thousands of dollars for um
uh in recent law school graduates if you this is for 2010 it still looks like this but uh if you look
at 1990 you would see sort of a typical distribution where there would be one mode and then long uh tail
to the right all right so uh something which is uh quite familiar to people who study distribution of
uh wages uh wages and then uh between 1990 and 2000 suddenly it broke into two peaks so by uh 2010 you
have one huge peak around 160 now it has moved to 190 by the way and another big around 50 now it has
moved to 60 thousand um so uh so this is sort of a graphic illustration of uh winners uh of that in that
game of uh aspirin chairs and losers because those uh most of those people have debt of like 200 000
dollars or something like that so essentially you're crushed by that and you're not making enough money
to even pay that off right uh so uh this is about 25 uh this is about uh from here 50 almost nobody in
between uh i've never seen uh such uh uh distribution of uh such uh bimodal distribution so this is um uh
you uh so what you've been doing over the past uh 20 or more years we are creating a huge pool from
which counter elites will be generated so these are people uh ambitious well-educated uh networked um uh and
uh and uh good organizers and that's uh what you need that's the second ingredient you need in the
successful revolution you need uh discontent amongst the masses and then you also need uh leaders
lawyer lawyer lawyer lawyer lawyer lawyer
second um popular profession for revolution is teacher by the mao was teacher and so was hung the
leader of um of typing rebellion but lawyers are the most dangerous uh perfect
all right so i won't go through this uh in great detail just say that i only covered i was only talking
about um how uh wealth pump leads to immiseration that uh increases mass mobilization potential how a
little production leads to internet competition there is also straight uh fragility which is connected to
that i'm trying to work my way through this uh feedback loops between different parts just to
illustrate my idea that it is really a uh a system all right and then uh of course international
environment you may have it i talk about all that in the book if you want so i won't spend much time
here let's just get to the last part quickly i only have six minutes so all right the crisis and aftermath
my good colleague uh walter shagel wrote a very nice book which i recommend all right called the great
leveler death is the great leveler here there addresses inequality as i just was explained i think
inequality is not a driver it's a good proxy right if you have um you know a little reproduction
immiseration inequality has necessary to grow so uh since this those numbers are readily available
that's a good proxy that society is getting into ill health but um um but he talks about inequality and
he's basically sees that the end game and times usually end in uh some kind of a really uh violent uh
uh turbulence and uh either like mass mobilization warfare transformative revolution state failure collapse
leading to civil war a little pandemic is another way to uh take this and so he he is basically very
pessimistic right so he is the doomer in fact i'm like me because i actually um think that um
things are not quite as dire so um so uh entry into the crisis it seems to be pretty channelized
right uh it's quite remarkable even though each society is different over the last five thousand
years where you have good data they at an abstract level right um they develop the same um uh immiseration
and uh editor production uh and state weakness uh problems but then you once you get to the crisis
this this is a cusp and then a whole bunch of um different uh roads open to you so the road to hell
is quite narrow but um once you uh get to it you have the many options so that's another way of thinking
about it the progress is trajectory and you have a revolutionary situation and then you you may have a
revolution a civil war collapse right uh it could be continuing instability or it could be
recovery and we have now we've built um we are building a crisis uh it's a database of past
societies sliding into crisis and then emerging from it and uh here is a crude semi-quantitative way
of um of quantifying the degree of uh crisis and we look at severity components here they are listed
you know whether there is population decline or not whether it's catastrophic population decline
you know it needs dispossession or extermination so uh uh you know um uh the civil war short
civil with long civil war territorial fragmentation and so on and so forth so if you score each crisis
you have now 170 of them and eventually we'll get 300 it takes a while to do this so if you score the
crisis that you have in the database unfortunately it's not quite uh symmetric as uh the ginkgo leave
suggests because uh the great majority of them are pretty dire there's some few outright collapses here
but uh most of the crisis so this is sort of uh walter shayadel territory right but um there are maybe
10-15 percent where um uh you um uh something happens the elites pull through uh uh and get population
on their side and they resolve situations without those uh uh dire consequences um and um i'll just give
you just run through a few examples so once that i studied very carefully was the um progressive era
through uh new deal that's when the united states was a sort of huge peak in the 1920 the united states
was in the revolutionary situation the elites got very frightened um they thought that both revolution
was even some some of them um but um all right then uh and because it was very frightened they actually
uh adopted a bunch of uh everything to uh to greater situation the charges here is here in um
in uh british empire at that time um interestingly enough you go back to uh early roman republic it's
something very similar and it also uh solved it uh in a uh in a uh in a uh internally peaceful way
and then uh another example i discussed in the book is the reform period in uh russia russian empire
1860s which was quite successful in uh postponing revolution by about 50 years
so all of those um uh they're always it's like riding a bicycle even
you have to constantly balance and so um uh the next two generation next generations have to also
make sure that uh the wealth pump is not working and um a little production is still open so and so
forth all right um so um uh this is uh what i'm passing around is the uk version this is the us version
of the book um uh so inevitable plug is that if you want to know more read my book um and um i uh yeah
and i've been giving this talk since 2007 already the first time again it was actually in sfi um and
it got it got much better of course but after um because i learned more and i every time between
2010 like 10 and 2016 i was uh saying that uh look again at what's happening to the median wages you
know what's happening to uh production of uh people with advanced degrees in wealth you could see that
in the wealth table they just keep getting more and more of them um and i was saying that we are still
on track um and of course then now we are in crisis we have been in crisis and the question is uh whether
we can and i think we can in principle navigate out but uh the future will show so thank you very much
much and i think it's your answer yes please in the back um you mentioned scheidel and um
yes and um he i think overlaps to a large extent with picketing in attributing the greater
equal outcomes after the second world war to the two world wars i mean and while you're focused on the
state um this seems to be an external factor so how would you position yourself in relation to people
who explain as a rise in equality in relation to external factors yeah so picketing and scheidel
they um actually it's a good uh problem because picketing essentially uh the main thing that uh
he's talking about is what i call the iron law or regard to why uh the wealth pump gets always turned
on right uh this is his famous equation in little r and things like that scheidel talks about it doesn't
have a good story um uh about he's here um in his data set he only looks at the period of great
compression which is from uh 1920s to uh to 1950 let's say uh all right uh has a much uh greater uh
speed of examples going away to the action history and so on and so forth and so essentially if you
look at them at those two you'll see that integrated phases is when um you know the pkt mechanism works
right these integrated phases when the scheidel method is resets uh the situation all right now i disagree
um um with uh the external war idea the world war one and the world war two uh because um we have
nearly 200 ages of this crisis but external wars uh is essentially a constant background there is huge
uh traumatic external wars during that during the integrated periods all right uh think about um roman
republic in the uh second century dc it was in the they solved the conflict of the orders
they reconfigured economies so that they shut down the wealth pump uh the elites there was huge degree of
cooperation between the elites and common people even they also had some approach to democratic things
and then um honeycomb comes around and he kills uh in four uh uh disastrous battles he kills 30 percent
of the population of male population and he kills even more of the elites the sanitary population was like uh
huffed as a result because they were fighting with that one and nothing uh this there was no collapse
nothing because because the this is the idea of uh of not stability but resilience it because the
society was in balance right it was very resilient to such uh shocks so um essentially um assigning
the big effect to world war one and two is a result of having a sample size of one
uh yes a couple of questions um first is i would like to suggest to you that uh your data doesn't
include any or maybe just one or two cases where there's been universal suffrage for men and women
in society yeah and i wonder if you have a prediction about how that is the outcome uh yeah that's
that's a very good question see because this side this um um uh it is integrative periods that came to
come every couple hundred years the last one we all have experienced was the middle of the uh 19th
century so in the continent it was the revolutions of 1848 in the united states the civil war england was
the only one that escaped uh uh which was uh which is why it was uh to the left of the scale in china you
had the most uh bloody uh civil war in human history probably 50 million people died here in the
uh tally being rebellion and so on and so forth so um so so then uh this revolution revolution has
petered out by earlier 20th century and for a century so we had uh uh uh the religious societies uh
that we are familiar with work in this integrated period so um what i'm trying to say is sorry this
section is that this new development of uh woman's suffrage came about uh just at the end of the
previous uh age of discord and so we there is no historical analogies that we could use and so
that as well yeah so it's just sorry i think also men suffered yes yeah yeah yeah uh but uh so but
uh so uh speculate um uh you can argue either way um women are certainly less prone to violence than men
that's uh that's been shown on average uh that's been shown by a number of studies so maybe having
more women in power positions uh would have uh an effect of making this conflict so that's the violence
that's the theory that i like because you have to leave through this but on the other hand um you
know um i think arguments are going the other way so let's let's let's let me answer the question is um
who knows and we'll find out yes very interesting talk i'm a historian dealing in engineering in
spaternia in particular and as you probably know there's a spectacular collapse of society across
the pension world they have of the bronze age about 1200 people yes um the current view is that
with new climate change very very external you see climate change exacerbating existing situations or
causes um so um so the way i'm thinking about it here is actually let's talk about uh predictability
and uh and drivers um uh i i think that the structural conditions such as i described
focus in my talk they are to a certain degree predictable and they are the ones who either say
that your society is uh resilient to such challenges or not now we are we have we have collected a
lot of climate data and we are currently doing a statistical analysis so the results are not in yet
but what uh seems already to emerge is that when societies are in integrative phases they uh you
know pretty horrible climatic uh things happen and they weather them so think about china during the
integrative phases this is sort of the good dynasty the good dynasty the first the first good half of
dynasty people get to the bed uh they have like um uh huge granaries full of rice and uh wheat all right
so uh climate event that comes is that is dealt with by uh giving peasants that um they are great
also at that point there is a favorable uh ratio of peasants to land and so they are not uh at the age of
starvation and so on and so forth so what happens is that uh structural drivers my thinking structural
drivers determine the society gets from the resilience to the fragility state and then climate
can be and then we see climate could be could serve as a trigger but there could be any kinds of
triggers triggers could be a pandemic you know for example we saw that very clearly uh with
got it because that was clearly uh the trigger uh for the outbreak of uh violence because you know
people were sitting cooped in and then suddenly they uh they were let out and they were very angry and
uh and it was very easy for um uh for to uh to get into rice and things like that so there are many
different uh triggers some triggers are you know like was easy muhammad was emulating himself in
Indonesia which triggered uh so triggers come i don't know i think i don't think they're really
predictable and so what you need to know is uh but on the other hand during in 1968 was it there
was uh i forget the name but there was a u.s veteran who self-amulated himself right uh and that
didn't bring about uh uh any kind of evolution or anything so um it's it really depends on where you
are what uh structural drivers any other questions have you looked at how severity changes over time
the prediction would be severity is decreasing because we have better institutions to deal with it
and similarly are socialist countries more than vulnerable to this debate so um yes that still
be the first part of the question yeah talk about this in the book um uh essentially uh again this
is not yet formal analysis but at first blush it looks like uh the severity of this uh crisis as
you measure them they uh decrease with time and but it's really not time it's really the more
institutions so you have some democratic institutions is one of those also you know uh a world religion is
actually uh seems to have a positive effect probably because they're constrained rulers
from being uh too selfish and uh and uh things like that so that that is one of the reasons that
gives me hope that um hopefully maybe and also you know um uh it's one thing when you are starving
and desperate and you're willing to kill right uh another thing is that uh you're you cannot afford the
house uh right you have to live with your parents so it's sort of the incentive uh for violence well
this is all uh i'm waiting uh so maybe it's useful thinking but uh but the pattern is that the more
institutions you have the uh the less severe the outcomes and what was the second part uh socialist
countries yeah well um you know uh you it's just uh so socialist countries like i grew up in the
soviet union and it was a remarkably um egalitarian society um uh but um elite overproduction uh does not
have to happen uh only by uh the wealth throughout what happened in the soviet union if you look who was
there in the squares uh uh the crowds that over that essentially overthrew uh the regime the great
majority of them it has a psychological status the great majority of them was the technical
intelligentsia these were people with uh engineering degrees that were hugely overproduced by the state
essentially it was a mistake made by the party rulers all right but um it's it's a very natural mistake
and we all think that education is um is it is a good and i and i think so but the credentials part
is the problematic part so same thing very similar thing happened in egypt uh they uh the mubarak um
regime increased the number of uh college uh students by a factor of four over like 10 years
but did but there was no there were no jobs for them so tahrir was basically those um uh frustrated
elite aspirants um you know who overthrew the regime any other questions yeah please thank you for the
great talk um i have a couple of questions first uh how do you apply your approach on more
uh authoritarian regimes and for example based on my own experience in iran yeah um so the uprisings are
massively oppressed by the regime can we look at the number of political prisoners or the number of
executions in your art or other uh similar countries uh in order to discuss how the trends are
are and um the other point about the education as you said about the egypt uh it's the same in iran um
and the over production of people with degrees they encourage people to uh go mostly to medical schools
but they arrest massively the um people in in political sciences for examples and lawyers so people
are discouraged to um go to these liquids uh and my uh second question is how let's let's deal with them
so yeah um my in my theory um uh democratic institutions um have a positive effect on stability
um mainly because they allow indeed rotation to happen in uh non-violent ways but it's not automatic
to uh that they will take care of themselves like you know i don't go to bed every night
happen that i live you know in the united states that i live in a country and therefore things somehow
will take care of themselves also if you read my book you'll see that i argue that united states is not a
democracy it's a democracy all right but um uh but um but in autocratic regimes uh beginning remember
they are oppressive but it's not the uh peasants with pitchforks who overthrow states it's counter-release
so um uh absolute modernities and dictatorships and so on they breed uh country leads uh that could
stand the leader uh in the back or overthrow them uh and this there's tons of examples of that so uh so
it's uh it's really uh as long as you know when an autocratic regime starts typically they have um first
of all they all fought together perhaps in the revolutionary war or some kind of a war right so they're all
good um uh they're all uh linked by uh uh uh but experience by their shared experience also they are
small and they are um not very greedy but that this is even i don't cycle essentially you know if you
familiar with this the second uh generation three generation rapidly lose all of that they become
greedy and also you have more and more of them and so a little production happens and the regime is
going down so uh so that's what's your second question yeah yeah the second question is uh how
do you see the influence of social media and these trends yeah i talk about this in the book many people
think that social media uh social media yes of course it's a um uh it's an enabler for people to
organize and uh you know uh uh uh and uh uh to protest for example against the regime so on the other
hand the regimes have been uh learning how to control social media to their advantage um i think
there are many ways that um that our society is different from the previous wave of revolutions
but in my book i do this little uh calculation i compare the uh speed with which uh the arab
spring of 2011 spread so it took about six months and i compare it to the spring of nations
uh 1848 it's about the same speed it turns out that i think that um that um uh using um uh
communications like telegraph and the media like newspapers works quite well and before that it was
just the word of mouth and uh you know uh so um i'm i'm not dismissing it but um uh to me this is
one of the secondary factors really uh in the theory and also all these types of uh in times have
been happening uh for the past five thousand years before i use social media and thanks so
sounds like i can have run out of questions
