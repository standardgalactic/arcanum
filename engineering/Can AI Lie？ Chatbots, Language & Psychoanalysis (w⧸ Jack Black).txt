in this episode so bearing in mind that ai in its you know it's in in in the language model format
is it's is using language that for me is one way in which we can start to bring in psychoanalysis
into this discussion because it's clear that our interactions with ai is through language
um uh in you know we're not i'm not obviously we're talking i'm talking here about the chat
bots in this paper you know i'm not talking for instance about robots or other forms of
uh machinery which is something i mentioned in the paper uh but yeah it's that relationship
you can have or that interaction you can have through language which is where i think you know
this more call it you know psychoanalytic more of a philosophical perspective can come through because
i do think you know i think i've had this discussion before i think you know particularly within
sociology and perhaps even more so obviously with more the science-based discipline disciplines is
that there's this assumption that we communicate freely and that we just need more communication
you know between different groups between different cultures or you know it really boils
my blood when sociologists say well everything's socially constructed through language and yeah okay
yeah we know that yeah that's true but also communication is incredible is an awful lot of
miscommunication because you know if we if we you know if we communicate freely then i'm on i'm so much
certain the world would not be the mess that it currently is and i would also think that if we
communicated freely we wouldn't have developed language as subjects i think you know language
emerges from the fact that we talk through miscommunication i think if there's a anything
that haunts the subject it's the fact that we have to try and make sense of this world and ourselves
through language so it's always mediated therefore it's always separated and it's often a very confusing
way of making sense of the world despite the fact that it's all we've got to make sense of the world
is hey everyone welcome to my conversation with the philosopher sociologist and psychoanalytic theorist
dr jack black not the actor although as equally cool as the actor uh when it comes to this conversation
around ai or perhaps more the philosophy of ai uh the research of codes is multifaceted and myriad
uh and i think there are the people that kind of theorize on probably the kind of work that i'm doing
uh on how can we have sentient ai or or ai that has some sense of human level intelligence dealing
with uncertainty uh without being pre-trained on a massive data set uh and how can we develop systems
that are robust to the extent that we humans are robust and adaptable and on the other side there
are people kind of working on what you would call the relationship between ai and human beings perhaps
a more classical term and more analytic philosophy would be um hci human competing direction now this
field of course has a lot of scientific uses of course in the neuro and cognitive sciences and then the
social sciences but at the same time and here's where i find uh jack's work very interesting there's
these more metaphysical questions of what does ai tell us about human subjectivity or subjectivity
as such and i asked jack when psychoanalytic theorists or people coming from more of his
lacanian jake and hegelian tradition when they speak of the subject what do they mean by the subject is
the concept of subjectivity akin to what someone like dave chalmers would call consciousness or someone
like and clark would call the extended mind so there are all these questions around subjectivity and
i'm glad that at the outset of the conversation i did ask jack this and we discussed this and the big
thing here of course is the unconscious a very in certain area certain fields are very controversial
terms put out there but i think the way uh jack particularly walking off the theory of lacan and
zizek does introduce a very distinct and interesting uh set of ideas into this dialogue around um
consciousness or subjectivity or or our relationship as in the subject's relationship uh to ai and machines
and it's along those lines i reached out to jack when i came across this paper can ai lie because he
does make a very interesting claim in the paper that something very innate and unique to subjectivity
is the ability for us to lie there are all these questions about ai alignment and ai ethics so
when are we gonna have super intelligent ai and this conversation is ongoing and sometimes the topics
are discussed ad nauseum um however you wouldn't think that what makes humans particularly unique to
any other entity in the universe would probably be uh how we lie and the kind of the way we use language
and how a lie is intertwined into how language works and functions for human beings uh so there's a lot
there and certainly if you are not coming from this camp of lacan jack hegel this might seem a bit out
there but jack i found was a very sort of down-to-earth just like speaks in very colloquial terms uh no
big jargon so uh i think and also more importantly i think he does make a lot of sense and he cogently
kind of articulates these these points uh with all that being said before we get to the conversation of
course a quick psa as you may know i've mentioned multiple times i'll never have advertisers or
sponsors on this podcast frankly i think we live in a society of excess and over consumption and i don't
want to contribute to that by selling you more things that being said though forgive me for the

all right back to the episode dr jack black is an associate professor of culture media and sport
at shuffled hallam university uk where he's affiliated with the center for culture media and society
and its research lead for the anti-racism research group he's an interdisciplinary researcher
primarily focused on freudolucanian psychoanalysis media and cultural studies authoring numerous books
including the psychosis of race racism and political correctness in comedy which was published with
ratledge and co-authored the edited collections of sport and psychoanalysis dr black has also written
about the relationship between ai and humans which was a central subject of the discussion as i was saying
it was a really fun conversation with jack and i hope to talk to him again soon and i think hopefully
when his next book is art which is on the relationship between um sport and psychoanalysis
i'd love to invite him on again soon uh with all that being said without further ado here's my
conversation with dr jack black jack thanks for being here man it's really privileged really enjoy reading
your paper um let's why not start with a big meaty metaphysical question um
what is a subject and can a machine ever become a subject okay good yeah no that is the the best
question to probably start with um so for me for me a subject is is read in in through lacan so in an
in an arcanian register so for me the subject and we could probably expand upon this uh with further
questions later on but for me the subject is a being of lack uh and it's obviously it has an unconscious
uh and it's self-divided so if we start from those sort of premises that's where i sort of was really
interested in looking at whether or not ai and obviously one of the debates in ai ai technology is
can it replicate or become you know can it create or or can it establish a level of intelligence which
is replicable to to the human being uh to the human subject um so these were nice questions that i could
ask in relation to that with regards to ai so for me can can can an ai be a subject at present no
because i think there's a number of important characteristics uh which define the human
subject which through lacan can allow us to unpick that question in relation to ai and whether or not
ai will ever have you know consciousness on a level that as i said is is similar to the subject so yeah
they're two ways yeah two two two good positions i think to start from yeah i agree i mean i like the
delineation you make uh in the paper between um kind of the let's call the positivistic sciences what
they study is the cartesian subject more the conscious side of the subject however i believe
for you something like a human being has this other more of the let's call the the negative side or the
the split side the unconscious which you can't capture at least as far as we know through the the natural
sciences like you i think you say computer science mathematics neuroscience and so on which kind of
encompasses the uh the ai research world yeah no definitely and that you know that for me will
always be the ultimate crux of positivism is that it assumes that cartesian rational subject and
obviously you know you know call it the beauty of psychoanalysis and you know the freud and the
introduction of the unconscious but just more widely you know i'm in my 30s and nothing of my experience
of the world has proven that we are rational subjects or that we wrap or that we act rationally we may make
conscious decisions but they're obviously reasons and desires and fantasies and unconscious uh elements
to that which which fuel and and choose those decisions for us perhaps so for me yeah um there's
something really interesting there that we we that we can explore um uh you know and and critiques
particularly when we look at positivism and those type of things i've done that more recently actually
in the context of sport i've really sort of tried to take the task a lot of sports science research
and in particular sports psychology which for me is is is really sort of indebted to that positivistic
outlook and uh doesn't really appreciate that there's this thing about sport that might actually
speak more to the unconscious so yeah it goes across as i say various it goes across numerous topics and
i think it's an interesting way of looking at the world and approaching these types of debates
as a matter of fact if you don't mind uh i think jack it's worth mentioning this because
i will be talking i mean in the introduction the the listener would know that i'm going to give like
i'm going to talk about your work in yeah in theorizing sports through psychoanalysis but perhaps
it's a good concrete example on how you explore this through your work in in in analyzing sports so
maybe just give us a bit of a brief um outline briefly for us yeah it's kind of weird so i bought so
so my back my background is actually in sports science so my undergraduate degree was in sports science my
master's was in sociology of sport um and then i did my phd rough you know my phd was essentially
a sociology uh phd um but it was really from about uh 2015 2016 onwards uh i had numerous colleagues
and friends say to me have you read she jack um and uh i i'm once i just remember that this incredible
summer where i went right uh i've got to start well what i actually did there's a bit of a lie i tried to
read plague of fantasies in the third year of my phd i i got through four pages and i sat there and i
thought to myself i don't understand a word of what is being said um i didn't and there was the only
point i said to myself i just thought well perhaps you're not mentally mature enough to understand what
it is he's trying to say um and i think that's probably a good thing to say to any you know undergraduate
students or postgraduate students you know if you don't understand anything it's not you know it's not
because you're stupid or anything like that you're just not at a point in your life where these things
are going to make sense to you um because then you know a few years later you know probably what would
it have been like four or five years later i returned to plague of fantasies and i remember
i think i got through the first 40 pages and i you know i looked at the note and i was like my god how
have i because it made sense it made you know the things he was saying were sort of there so yeah it was
reading zizek and then reading lacan uh and then a lot of my researchers tended to focus on media and
cultural studies um and then it was only about uh it was probably about four years ago i you know i
started thinking hold on a sec i really am missing something here i i've got a background in sport i work
in a sport department i really should start applying psychoanalysis to sport so uh in particular with my
friend uh joseph rinosso uh with sort of work together on various projects trying to trying to bring
together the world of psychoanalysis to sport uh we're both lacanians so we tend to draw upon
the canyon theory but we've done an edited book and a special issue which have both explored those
connections so yeah so i always have you know i think the good thing about this ai stuff is i quite
i tend to read something and then that gets me thinking about ai and then i sort of you know i
don't know perhaps there's something wrong with me but then i have to write a paper on it just to get
the thoughts and ideas out so i tend to have this sort of these two streams to my research i tend to have
a sport and psychoanalysis stream and then a more call it media and cultural studies stream which
obviously was referring here to to ai so and the beauty of lacan is these things cross over so
different different concepts make sense i think in different topics or you might not for instance
understand uh uh so for instance i was yesterday i was at a conference i was talking there about uh
lacan's the language uh language and you know it's been a concept that i've struggled with or had to you
learn over the last few years but in the context i was speaking about it it kind of made sense it
for me it was helping me understand it so again i think that's one of the fun things that i can is
that there's this wealth of concepts and ideas that all interrelate but can also be applied to
different topics and projects yeah no doubt i can't think of lacanian theory kind of the way
uh how kirk god speaks of religion where it's not that you look at different kinds of it's like
you know i'm obviously paraphrasing here kirk says that again different religions and i'm like okay
christianity has these things and islam is these things buddhism is these things and i tick all the
boxes i pick christianity uh but he's like no if you think you're an idiot that's not how it works you've you
see the truths of christianity by in fact first becoming a christian and i think zedek writes on
how pascal kind of takes this into the the past column of age oh wager um so i view the canyon
theory kind of like that where if you want to like if you think okay i'm just going to try and
juxtapose cognitive science and lacanian theory or i'm going to try and compare
jungian theory with the canyon theory and see what what what works out best i don't think that
works i think you need to kind of become a lacanian first to see what like yes no i think that's a
great connection yeah i think you're completely right and um i think we were discussing it before
as well i mean you know if anybody wants to understand the car that well i think that you
know there's the reference there to zizek isn't it who essentially says if you try and read lacan
on his own it's it's gobbledygook it's very it's very difficult find a key find someone to help you
into it and whether that's someone like bruce fink whether that's someone like zizek elenka
shapanjit and madeline dola or other scholars such as todd mcgowan mary rooty there are ways in which
you can get in and as soon as as soon as you see the way in which they present it you then then read
lacan and it just comes alive and yeah for me it's like a drug i think there's there's yeah actually
you know it's you just devour the seminars after that because they just make they just make so much
sense and and and they really shed light on the world in in ways that ways that i weren't taught
to look at the world put it that way um which i quite that's it yeah i completely agree i mean for me
it's funny like a lot of people getting you like going through zizek because i'm just like he's a big
charismatic huge figure but uh for me it was mary rudy uh and i really i threw her books um funny enough i
picked up a book um on i think it was it was marketed as an anti-self-help book but i thought
right self-help book and i when i was like 18 19 maybe um yeah and i was like oh what's who's this
lacan guy like you know and then i googled it and then one of the jack's videos came up and that's
kind of how i fell into it that's it's not the you know one of the only books i think i think there's
only about two two of those i haven't actually read but i'm one of which it's not the penis envy
book is it no it's not penis anyone no this is all right i'm literally reading this one at the minute
i was yeah this was uh that's i hadn't read penis envy before so i'm reading that now uh but as i
said i was at a conference this week and as i was getting on the plane like one of my uh one of my
colleagues sort of said you know what you're reading and i just went into this 15 minute discussion on how
brilliant the book was and how wonderful yeah you know what you know was as a writer and i think you know
what he's you know i yeah i was i was worried everyone in the queue like was thinking who's
this crazy person but yeah right it's yeah we we lost her too soon man it's sad i mean she was great
because she was even and she was fantastic as you said at kind of articulating in a very almost like
common sensical way lacanian theory i mean she had a conversation with the physicist uh sean carroll
for instance who's like very you know empiricist that kind of thinking but she beautifully outlined
what psychoanalysis is all about uh and lacanian theory to to even a person like him uh the book
yes by the way it's yeah this sounds just like a soft book the call of character living a life worth
living so you'd think that this is a you know subtle book but no it was a really fun book to read um
no yeah no a beautiful a beautiful writer as well i didn't actually i didn't know her i i saw her
present at a conference online but there's something yeah so i don't i never want to speak too flippantly
on these but there's something beautiful about the fact you can just live in her books now so she's
always like there you know like there's something quite i always think there's something quite wonderful
that about writing books in that respect that they sort of yeah you can return to them and she's like
i said she's such a brilliant writer you do feel like she's like talking to you it's quite a lovely
i agree yeah yeah yeah yeah well uh jack so to kind of uh yeah sorry i'm kind of taking off
off course here but that was a good fun i guess uh tangent to go on um the the question of ai and
psychoanalysis i mean it's obviously the kind of the theme of this conversation i'm hoping is going to
be can ai lie but again just to build a bit of groundwork let's say um how about maybe you could you
could tell us for those working in the philosophy of ai or kind of uh let's call it the sociology of
ai or kind of analyzing ai outside of purely just like the engineering building programming sense but
even for those people who are kind of thinking about this what insights in your view does psychoanalysis
in particular i have uh for thinking about uh artificial intelligence yeah i mean just you
know to not repeat what we've all what i've already said but i think the way it sends or well in many
ways psychoanalysis de-centers the subject but in the way in which it puts the subject forward as a topic
or a point of discussion or inquiry so for me what i think that and if you're looking at lacanian if
you're looking at the lacanian subject you're automatically starting to look at language you're starting to look at
at the ambiguity of the subject and how that is often reflected through language so bearing in mind
that ai in its you know it's in in in the language model format is it's is using language that for me
is one way in which we can start to bring in psychoanalysis into this discussion because it's
clear that our interactions with ai is through language um in you know we're not i'm not obviously
we're talking i'm talking here about the chatbots in this paper you know i'm not talking for instance
about robots or other forms of uh machinery which is something i mentioned in the paper
uh but yeah it's that relationship you can have or that interaction you can have through language
which is where i think you know this more call it you know psychoanalytic more of a philosophical
perspective can come through because i do think you know i think i've had this discussion before
i think you know particularly within sociology and perhaps even more so obviously with more the
science-based discipline disciplines is that there's this assumption that we communicate freely
and that we just need more communication you know between different groups between different
cultures or you know it really boils my blood when sociologists say well everything's socially
constructed through language and yeah okay yeah we know that yeah that's true but also communication
is incredibly an awful lot of miscommunication because you know if we if we you know if we communicate
freely then i'm on i'm so much certain the world would not be the mess that it currently is and i
would also think that if we communicated freely we wouldn't have developed language as subjects
i think you know language emerges from the fact that we talk through miscommunication i think if
there's a anything that haunts the subject it's the fact that we have to try and make sense
of this world and ourselves through language so it's always mediated therefore it's always separated
and it's often a very confusing way of making sense of the world despite the fact that it's all we've got
to make sense of the world is language so yeah for me that's one of the conundrums of the subject which
those sort of you know distinctions you can start to bring in um i remember saying this once i work
on a project with a statistician uh a great academic but you know very statistical comes up with like ai
formulas to identify online hate uh and and forms of on expressions of online hate and i remember saying
this to him and he went jack please no language has to mean these these terms have to otherwise i can't
train the computer and that i thought was really interesting because you know there was there was
no room for ambiguity in what he was doing and that itself was being sort of you know put into this
algorithm and this machine would therefore scour you know certain events and on twitter in particular
four forms of online and hate but you know we were you know we learned out very quickly that language
wasn't as clear as perhaps he was assuming so okay so let's let's kind of try to speak a little bit
here now um you take an llm now any really most of the llm is a big problem and there's like in fact
i think billions of dollars invested just on researching this particular area where hallucinations
in llms so they talk about how llms randomly hallucinate i mean when uh i remember when i think it was gpd 3.5
when it came out with uh chachi pd the the initial versions were hallucinating like crazy um and i i i
so i don't know uh i i think i'm being a bit pedantic here but i'm being pedantic i think more for the
sake of someone who's not familiar with this notion of miscommunication so what if uh yeah someone says
hey look i mean ai kind of already is a mess uh you know large language models already do hallucinate
they already do lie and they already do uh deceive not deceive intentionally but at least give um
unfactual information uh or spew complete utter nonsense at times so yeah maybe delineate what do you
mean by miscommunication in the context of how lacanian theory and psychoanalysis views language
as opposed to all these other examples i just gave yeah no that's a that's a great link and a great
question so yeah obviously they uh ai chatbots can get things wrong and they often do so they're clearly
inconsistent machines and they can also lie as well so in particular my paper that that the paper emerged
from i think an article that zizek had written and published online where he was trying to test the
ai or asking the ai should i be a communist um and you know the ai gave you know a very sort of ai
response um and you know it said um i can't and i can't remember exactly what the way it was so i'm
paraphrasing but the ai essentially said something like you know i'm not a real person i can't give you
advice on which you know whether or not you should be a communist or not and jizek says um he says
that's that's a lie and it fundamentally relies upon what he often refers to as the i know very well but
nonetheless uh from octave manoni so the argument here is that although uh the the ai is technically
telling the truth it's not a real person there is no button but it doesn't have that but nevertheless
so in that sense there is a lie at play there because despite the fact that it is telling the
truth in actual fact it's talking despite the fact it says i'm not a real person it is talking like a
real person and expressing a statement so in our interactions with it we have to assume on a certain
level that we are talking to some type of person you know or something in the just to have the basic
interaction so what this got me thinking about was how important lying was not just to the unconscious
but also how important lying was to distinguish and what it is that makes us subjects so yes ai can lie
what i argue in the paper is it doesn't lie like a subject it doesn't for instance lie authentically
now i use that term authentically not to say that there is some higher level or pure form of lying
but to say that actually when we as human beings when we when we talk when we communicate there's
often lies embedded in the way in which we talk and to discuss about things that actually we lie
in various different ways just just as being subjects so this again just got me thinking
about so many different issues you know the link between truth and lie isn't isn't so demarcated you
know it's not so split but actually the two are sort of uh i think this is the length of the
subhanic argues is that they're actually asymmetrical so there's actually a connection there between
the two between the two so for me that's that's one way in which we can start to distinguish what
makes subjects different is that subjects lie in a particular way and that you could explore through
some of the khan's concepts and ideas um as i said the the lie from the the you know the the chat gpt
is you know it's it's almost like a very i don't know what the terminology is you know it's almost like
a robotic lie you know i mean but in itself you know it might say it's not a real person but it is
acting and interacting as if it is a real person in the way it asks you little prompts the way it
discusses and gives its own little opinions on stuff yeah that that was i thought something quite
interesting and then when we a human being engages with the ai would you say it's some sort of to use a
term by like fetishistic denial where you know because you mentioned the i know i i know a real
but is that is that kind of where the fetishistic denial comes in or yeah i am i kind of off course
there no no i think i think you're wrong i think i think you're right because i'm the argument you
know is making this is that there is no but nevertheless or i know very well but nevertheless and
it's actually the but nevertheless which is really interesting in in any sort of exploration of that
idea or that concept um obviously supanjic has written more recently in a book on disavow that
there's a fetishization of i know yeah there's a fetishization of the knowledge but it's where that
but nonetheless is for me where the uh where the ambigu ambiguities of the subject start to come out
that's where you get expressions of disavow that's also where you get the ambiguity of perhaps the
subject um it's also where it ties in with ideology so you can make that broader social link as well
so for instance you know we you know the most obvious one would be you know our current ideological
position which is clearly one of cynicism you know i know very well that capitalism is awful
with all these problems but you know nevertheless you know i'm embedded in it i still have to get
a job i have to pay the mortgage i have to go to the supermarket um you know the way in which
it sort of embeds you in its sort of structures is the way in which ideology is played out so
yeah so that so that button there that there is no but nonetheless or but nevertheless there's none of
that in the ai which is really interesting i think and that's that was kind of the crux really the
jumping off point from where i wanted to explore this concept this notion of lying you know from gizek's
original piece yes so i don't know if the term is a dialectic but in a certain sense there's a
dialectic between truth and lies right so you say in the paper like you say ultimately what is true
is is itself accessed via the uh full city of a premise a truth that is brought to light
via the means of a lie now that is going to be really people are going to think that that's just
like unnecessary obfuscation what do you mean by uh oh yeah that is brought to light by the means of
a lie now i know very well what you're saying there especially because gizek makes the he kind of makes
the other point where you can you can tell a lie by means of truth and he uses the famous example of
the jews here you know the the nazis were saying kind of empirically you can say yeah the jews they you
know they were exploiting workers yeah probably they're probably some capitalist jews yeah the jews
were seducing german women in the 1950s yeah oh my gosh i hope they were yeah that's good if they were
but yeah but still anti-semitism is nonetheless a lie so it's like and so how do you make the point that
well yes by but by a truth can be brought to life by our lies yes so this is again and i it took me
i i did spend a couple of weeks sort of going through this it can it is because it's quite
counterintuitive so the example you drew upon was brilliant there and that's actually the example i
always refer to so you often have this distinction between lying with truth and telling the truth by
the means of a lie so in the first instance is the one you highlighted there which zizek often draws
upon so it's lying with truth so for instance as you quite rightly said you know uh what did the nazis
do in 1930s germany where they said look the jews are all in these positions of power they're in
banking they're in you know media they're in politics um and that's the reason why this country's
you know you know that's the reason why germany's struggling they're the problem now the crux of that
is actually that there's a truth to that because the uh jews were in those positions and they were in
those jobs but the lie comes from the way in which it was used and the way in which the uh the truth in
that respect is um uh is is undermined or through the lie if that makes sense so i'll try to think
of various different examples of which we could do this the only one i could and again i sort of
jumped to a sporting example whereas you know if someone said um you know we never lose at home we
never lose when we have a match at home okay well if you've only had one game at home then that is
that is lying with the truth in a certain respect now you're true you've never lost at home but the lie
comes out in the fact that actually you know you haven't really been very clear there you've only
had one one match at home so that's one way in which lying and truth don't seem as separate things
but they're sort of interrelated i think in the the point that's coming that's coming out of that
and the next one is obviously like telling the truth by means of a lie so this is where you have
a falsehood that reveals a deeper truth and this is one i think that's really quite interesting because
i think this comes out in so many different ways so you know you might have it with you know you
might say to your partner i don't know i i love you to the moon and back or something or i love you
more than you know all all the whatever in the world now obviously i can't love anybody from the
moon to the back that's that's a ridiculous thing to say it's a lie but it tells a truth it highlights the
love you have for somebody um you might have again a football coach who says you know our team never
gives up um but they might be on a bit of a losing streak and they lose and the results aren't very
good so again the team might not give up but it's it's a lie in that respect so this for me opens up
a whole you know telling the truth by means of a lie um opens up this whole world in which we can
approach various different issues and one of the things i was i've looked at i i looked at this in
regards to um counterfactual history something that zizek's written uh a lot on and um yeah so i was
interested in how this asymmetry between truth and lies can come out through the way in which we often
approach the past so i think i was often i did read a book i read it through my phd i was trying to
find it the other day actually um in preparation for this so i can't remember exactly what the title was but
i think it was an edited collection um written by the historian nile ferguson and it was essentially
you know at any historical moment what if some what's the opposite had occurred so for instance
what if what germany had won the first world war what would have happened so it was counterfactual
histories um but the book was really good because it sort of grasped what what zizek is getting at
here and it sort of highlighted the importance of this this this relationship between truth
and lying because the argument there that zizek makes is that it's only from a counterfactual premise
so something that didn't happen or something that is not true that you can actually find a path
or find the truth of the factual so this doesn't mean that you can just come up with any sort of
version of anything and just you know talk completely out of nonsense what it actually means
is you need to find the right lie to arrive at truth and that for me was a really interesting
a dilemma or a really interesting way of approaching certain things so you know regardless of what you
you know you think of the film i became really interested in in sort of you know when i was
reading this uh quentin tarantino sort of historical little era of films you know where he had uh jaguar
untrained and glorious bastards and there was the hateful eight now obviously um you know it's they're
not true history really in any true sense i wrote i wrote a paper on jango unchained the film jango
unchained where i explored this obviously the film it doesn't draw upon any historical uh uh truth in
any real sense it's not it's not like 12 years a slave for example but actually what i make the
argument is that you can actually through that counter creating this counterfactual world this
this fictional world that there's truths about slavery uh that actually come out of the film that
we can really explore so for me that was one you know a good example of how you can make this
counterfactual argument perhaps and i do say this in the paper perhaps in a perhaps in a way that
12 years a slave fails you know because 12 years a slave is obviously you know you know very well
produced well directed film but um you know the lead character i always found the film so strange
because you watch that film 12 years a slave and then you i don't think this is a spoiler in any sense
and then you finish the film and you realize that actually um i can't remember the first it's
northrop is i think the main character it's based upon but um you know he's you know he's a free
man he's then uh uh kidnapped turned into a slave it becomes a slave in the south and then he's freed
but actually he dies in really mysterious circumstances like he essentially i think he
disappeared like i think he then became like a like an abolitionist uh uh speaker and you know
clearly became a sort of a political political whatever figure to try to prevent slavery but
then you know there's the argument that you know was he murdered because he does just disappear and
just died i think his family just he just never came home one day and that is just like a title
card at the end of the film and i always thought my god that's the film i've just sat through 12 years
a slave but that to me is that to me is perhaps says more about slavery and you know black oppression and
racism in america than what the the film just did in all those narratives and scenes that it created
so you know i'll make the point there i think i would argue django on chain is a better film about
slavery for that reason because it uses a fictional premise to make better truths and better insights
into uh uh you know the you know african slavery in the u.s during that period and and you know perhaps
still today and especially the way in that very post-modern way that quentin tarantino mixes uh
mixes genres but also past and present sort of a temporality aspect there so i hope i know that's
very roundabout way and i know we move away a bit from there but it's good they use concrete examples
there good so so for me you know if we're making this distinction between lying with truth and telling
the truth by means of a lie there's clearly an ambiguity there which speaks to the subject it speaks it
gets to the subject and i don't think ai can understand that that distinction or it doesn't
perform that distinction in the same way that a subject does um um i mentioned it before yeah yeah
yeah but now you finish it please no no go on no because i was going to mention about the lies
paradox so i don't know if that's one way you want oh yeah we're going to get we're going to get there
for sure yeah that's very yeah because the thing is jack i think i had this thought in fact last week
when we originally planned to do record this before i got sick it was a notion of i mean what you're
saying here this is kind of the kenyan notion that truth is structured like fiction kind of as like a
truth in like a symbolic world that can appear in some sense uh but it's a bit different to like a
metaphorical truth isn't it because because i think the problem with the metaphorical truth is it kind of
it kind of points so it kind of says there's a thing in itself there's like a substantial truth
and metaphor is kind of like a signifier or it's something that symbolizes this substantial truth
this ontologically real thing somewhere whereas correct me if i'm wrong here maybe i'm just putting
words in your mouth what you're trying to argue in this paper is in some sense it's in the split the not
working or let's call it in the contradiction as such where the truth appears it's not so i think
jack makes this point when you behind the veil there's nothing there's nothing there's no uh
nothing but that you can speak of in any meaningful sense yeah yeah brilliant yeah you're right so
yeah for me there's a contradiction in truth so in a weird way like truth can can only be
access or mediated in this case obviously we've been drawn upon fictions and through lies but the
truth there is like you said there's nothing behind the veil there's a gap there's a lack that is
obviously inherent to reality i think that's the link that zizek's made or the improvement of the
development that zizek's made of lacan whereas the lacan lack was obviously ontologically embedded in our
sense of beings as subject it's from lack that we desire it's from lack that we that we speak you
know with lack in being hence we need language to try and make sense of that lack or to cover it up but
then it's also something that is then retroactively created as well you know we we have this sort of
it's always the subject is always working backwards in that respect the connection today
yes yeah yeah and that's obviously this is yeah that's the brilliance of zizek bringing in hegel
into these lacanian discussions so so for me metaphor is quite interesting because for me you
know i'm i'm a i'm a fan of metaphor in the sense that metaphor is one way in which you can expose lack
in or you can expose that ontological lack um matthew fliss fliss flader has a brilliant book algorithmic
desire where he says that we should we should uh um use the social media metaphor use you think of
social media as a metaphor because what it gets us thinking about is that idea of creating a media
which is in itself social so there's nothing inherent to social media but through metaphor and through
obviously fiction or or just through the symbolic and through political action we create the media we
want and i think it's one way of always you know the thing to get there is you're never you know
you're never fixed now this is a key bit of lacan meaning is never fixed he's not a you know i would
say like a daft bloody post-modernist where you know everything's fluid everything you know meaning
could be anything all right no no there are for a bit if you could just that's a really important
point you do touch on that even in the paper that the lacanian which is different to the post-modern
subject so just if you could you know as maybe as an addendum comment on that too
important definitely yeah so i don't you know i don't i don't think lacan is a post he's not
post-modern yeah he's not you know um i wonder you know that wonderful comment that tom mcgowan
says like post-structuralism no post-structuralist they refer to themselves as a post-structuralist
like it was just a way of defining i think he says it's a way of a it was the way americans defined
the threat like european theory essentially um so i don't even think there's post-structuralism for me
lacan is a structuralist um and you know what what uh what i think is exposing the card is actually
you know he's a he's like a funny sort of structuralist because there's there's a lack
there's negativity in this positive structure or whatever so i think this is an important thing
because um it ties to a number of things in the sense that you know whereas a post-modern argument
would be that um you know someone like derrida uh uh i read something brilliant the other day which
someone was saying i think it was lacan who said that derrida just plagiarized him and
that's really like reframed how i approach uh derrida now um uh yeah so you know where meaning
is fluid nothing's fixed you know we're constantly reinterpreting things in various different ways
it's all about multiplicity well the important point there to think of lacan is i don't think
he's like well he doesn't deny multiplicity but where you know you know where does that multiplicity
come from because because to have the multiplicity it's like you need a stable ground you need you
need you need something presupposed for all those different interpretations to run off and be made
and be created whereas the point that lacan makes is that actually no it's lack there is no stable ground
the lack the ground has holes in it it's fractured it's inconsistent there's a lack in the in our ontology
in the notion of reality in our sense of being that is therefore expressed through these multiple
different ways and also lacan approaches that through the signifier the sliding of the signifier
um you know if you think of a sentence and if you think when you read a sentence you move from word to
word you know and then the punctuation the full stop is you know does fix a form of meaning and then
but then meaning works retroactively you only really know what the sentence was saying when you get
that full stop so there is meaning and things can become fixed um you know ways and you know forms
of authority i have a god daughter who's at that stage where she's just asking question after question
after question and i think the last time i was with her i just went i don't know i was like i don't know
that's or i think i was like because it is because it is you know i mean i had to punctuate the master yeah
yeah yeah i was the master i was yeah you know scansion i just stopped it there boom done right
we're done okay that's it now stop asking questions um yeah so i think and and that for me is the
difference a very you know perhaps a subtle difference but a clear difference there in the
way in which lacan's viewing language in the world and reality in a way say a post-modernist would um and
obviously if we're talking about the sliding of the signifier i like to think that you know that's
where you one way in which you could approach the unconscious as well um you know the unconscious
is structured like a language it's not yeah it's not language it's structured like a language so the
same way signifiers move from signifier either you know if you look at a sentence in front of you
you know don't forget the gaps between the words and that for me that's where the unconscious that's
what he means about it being the unconscious is the gaps the inconsistencies that come out through
through being um yeah before i interrupted you i think we were talking about metaphorical truths
um and i think that's where this connection is made where yes the kind of the the the kind of the
the fiction that gives rise to truth that you speak of is more in the realm of the the gap the
contradictions the antagonisms uh as opposed to some kind of like metaphorical truth because in
it's funny enough you said it's like if you take someone like jung you know jung speaks of like
archetypes and whatnot and for him you could say yeah archetypes are metaphors for some deeper psychic
structure all these stories and myths speak to some substantial reality out there but for account
like hon it's now that's not the case no yeah yeah there's nothing there's nothing deep inside of us
there's nothing you know there's this is this is this is the weird this is the beauty of psychoanalysis
is that like i think if you speak you know most popular perceptions of psychoanalysis is that you
go some you go into therapy they often call it therapy don't they or you go into psychoanalysis and
you're fixed you know because you find out something deep within you or something like that no no no no
you know i can't say that there's nothing there's there's you know if there is this rubbish and there's
shit or there's you know there's nothing there um and that's kind of it about you know think of truth
in the same way truth is a distortion of of our own desires and fantasies but there's still a truth
to that if that makes sense we can still approach the world in that relation um and it's and you know
and certain truths work quite well in that regard but often the way in which if you want to explore them
and if we want to um i think take a more considered truthful perspective on how it all works um and
you're looking at the ambiguity there perhaps more between truth and lies and correct yeah i mean
i'm not a bit of an agentum here but i spoke to stan when healed and he made a really good point that
in some sense this is why not that we kind of uh give it a salience but if you could let's say uh
put put it in a topology or like a hierarchy you probably can put the hysteric a bit at the top
because hysteric does in many ways the hysteric that's the historical subject is in some sense
most sensitive to this gap the antagonisms the incompleteness whereas you know sin when he said that
the neurotic is kind of an idiot he kind of he accepts he's kind of being a he's stupid he accepts the
kind of symbolic reality as it is yeah no and you know just to add and the psychotic is completely
like you know because they they've completely different relationship to language and obviously
they're not questioning because for them there there are these sort of immediate whatever these
immediate truths and everything so yeah that's a great way i think yeah and i think you know he's
completely right to make that argument you know it's that questioning of the other you know what what
you know what what am i of you know you know who is the what am i of you know to you to the other
that questioning of desire and i think you know i think jesus very clear on this that you know we we
should be in the position of the hysteric for that reason to question stuff and that again that starts
to bring in really interesting topics around knowledge around desire around how the these different
things are portrayed because it highlights that you know nothing's ever fixed or stable but we're always in
this this sort of um this relationship perhaps to truth to that is this is always being distorted by
our own questioning if that if that makes sense and oh no no doubt well i mean i certainly discuss this
the subject of knowledge versus the subject of desire i think that'd be a good place to to in fact
maybe perhaps and conclude but before that to this very fun bit in your paper which i really thoroughly
enjoy reading it is it's this the paradox you bring up between i am lying and i thought
and perhaps this even beautifully articulates the split subject so you say yeah the paradox of i
am lying that sentence there it's a contradictory statement over a sentence and then you kind of
outline like hones uh the subject of enunciation and enunciated uh and so yeah please just outline
that bit jack yeah i absolutely love this i've used it across a number of different papers and different
ideas this the subject of enunciation and enunciated because um uh you know for me if you know if
you're saying if you're following lacan's account of the subject the subject is divided the subject is
split um i think particularly if you're talking to someone from the social sciences they're like well
hell you know show me what do you mean how does that work and this for me is a great way of sort of
expressing that so so there's two things there's the enunciated and then there's the enunciation uh that
lacan refers to and there's the eye of the enunciated so that's the statement that's made by the subject
so i am talking now and i am making statements i'm using language and that's what's being enunciated
there's an eye in that because these words are leaving my mouth and this is my interpretations and
my expressions that are being expressed um but then there's also the eye of the enunciation and
that's the position from which that is said okay so that's my that's where for instance the uh um
the position of oneself or the position of the subject is being made and one way lacan highlights
this is is through the the lies paradox so for instance if we say i am lying that's where the
ambiguity or the contradiction between the enunciation and the enunciated and the enunciated comes out or
becomes performed because these two things can never really align with each other so for instance
if the person if a subject says i am lying um then then they can't for instance uh then in a certain
respect if they're equal you know if they're if they live up to that then they can't be lying because
they're telling a truth about themselves so there's the statement i am lying and then there's the eye the
position from which it is said so if that you know and so i am lying is this weird con you know
contradiction because if if if you if you follow them they're lying so they're not lying but then
if they're if they're not lying then they're not they're not a liar if that makes it it's kind of
weird when i often find you know it's easier it's easier to think this through when it's written down
so that's the way in which the split subject comes out you have the split between the predication of the
statement the enunciated i am lying but then the position from which it is said so the position of
the person and the two never in the case of the i am lying paradox the two never they never connect
they never they never meet up so you can see the the where with the path i took here you know
zizek saying that uh ai lies but but not like a subject so then you look at the subject and then
you know it's lakana has this brilliant example of the the liar's paradox that actually gets to the
heart a little bit there of what is a subject um so yeah so that's one way i tried to explore that
explored it in other ways i looked at i did a paper on um uh on uh examples where people have
apologized for racism so um yeah so i was looking so i looked at how uh yeah at the outset of the
conversation yeah yeah so it was just yeah it was two it was two british it was that well three british
comedians but two of them are like a a double act um and both had like performed racist uh scenes
racist comedy scenes and both were now having to apologize for it um but what i think got played out
there was this ambiguity of the subject the fact that you could never really truly apologize because
there was this split between your apology the statement but then the position from which it was made
so yeah i thought it was just an interesting way of exploring again the same dynamic but also it's
it's clearly there being portrayed in in in the ai because the ai would say i am you know the ai might
say i am not lying but then it's you know it's only ever really talking there from the enunciated it is
it's ignoring the position from which it said which is that often you know it's a machine so it's always
in a certain way lying because it's not a real person well the problem yeah the problem here i
think you know i really like that you get at this even in the paper but you interject makes this point
is that in some sense because the ai lacks this the split that subjects do have they can't include
themselves into the equation right because it's a machine they can't put their their subjectivities and
caught up or entangled in the mess so to speak yeah yeah they can't they can only speak from the
they can only speak from one or the other or perhaps you know they can i i can't remember how
explicitly i think in the paper i say they you know they only ever talk from the enunciated in that
regard so they they're in language yes they have language and they live in language but they don't
live in it in the same way that a subject does um following this localian argument that it doesn't
it doesn't it'll never probably truly it might express ambiguity and inconsistency but does it
understand itself as as being ambiguous and inconsistent because the subjects you know we
are always we are always expressing ourselves with that ambiguity and inconsistency it's there all the time
you know um there's a point i'm making the paper about uh from mcgowan who says you know sociality is
based upon the lie you know you're going to work morning that was your day and people say yeah
but you really want to know about the day yeah yeah yeah you couldn't care less about it and it's
yeah i even you know i find you know i don't want to you know i have probably shouldn't say this oh no
they won't listen to the podcast but you know i have friends and colleagues who have kids and i always
have to tell myself don't forget to ask about the kids just say like you know other kids you know
that are boys getting on or whatever yeah and i'll be honest with you know i don't you know they're
lovely parents i wish nothing upon the kids but i couldn't care less what the kids yeah and the truth
is it's going to be the other way around for us i mean i don't know if i'll ever have kids but if my
partner we have i'm sure people are going to ask us about our kids and then yeah yeah yeah no definitely
definitely i have you know you know you know i say that but then i always think like uh you know
like i have i have a great friend who will say oh he's being a little at the minute or something
or like oh they are doing my and i can't it's almost like when they say i'm like oh wow this is
a we can have a friendship you know this is you've just made the conversation sexy now uh yeah when you
get that sort of honest response but yeah you know these you know these things are based upon you
know our whole sociality is predicated on these lies and these things that we might not you know
might not necessarily uh have any attachment to it's one of the things why you know i tried saying
this to a manager at work i was like they were making the claim we should all be back in the
office and i was like you do know i will do more work at home purely based upon the fact
i won't have to talk to anybody like if i if i go into the office i'm gonna say hello to people and
chat in the bloody in the resource room and stuff like that like at home it's just me and the cats
like you know i mean i'll be okay right yeah yeah well i mean okay here's a a lovely quote from
apropos stupidity you say here more importantly what this more readily says is a lying like a subject
more importantly what this more readily reveals is that it is not a better knowledge and here's where
we're beginning to the topic of knowledge that distinguishes us from the ai chatbot but that it is
in spite of our knowledge uh and full view of what it is that we are doing that the subject is both
forged and enveloped in the capacity to lie instead where truth is an effect of surprise triggered
by its enunciation important to jack here for the chatbot there is no truth to its enunciation no gap
failure or surprise for which the truth of its position can be averted and he is important by
important as previously noted we can now assert that in all its stupidity the chatbot is not stupid
enough to fall uh to fall foul to the truth of its mistakes and i i this is kind of why i really like
dialectical thinking you see i love that for instance the dialectic between ignorance or stupidity
and knowledge and you think you can speak of uh artificial general intelligence and then
comes in and says no no it's not about intelligence it's about stupidity that's what makes us
sense this is this is brilliant uh philosophy that it's wonderful yeah it's brilliant yeah
no it is good it is good because you said it just it completely utterly reframes like in that
wonderful way as you does it completely reframes the discussion and sort of spins it around we're
looking at ori now at the problem at the top because you know he so often says but yeah you know
rather than think of it you know you know we're we're different to ai because we're cleverer than
the ai or alternatively perhaps ai is going to be cleverer than us he's like no the true crux of it
is is can it be as stupid as us because the sheer subject will always have you know a level a claim to
stupidity that ai will never have because their stupidity will always be um uh well created
structured you know i mean programmed in that regard it won't it won't recognize its stupidity
which i think is the real crux of the point there it won't recognize what it's doing it won't have
that unconscious element to it i think which is key no doubt no doubt yeah all right chuck i want to touch
a bit on um your paper i didn't read this carefully so i can't comment much on it the it's the the dialectic
of desire uh chat bots and the desire to know however before we get to that just again to
probably be a kind of now repeating this point i'd notice him here perhaps he could outline how you
would differentiate um a subject of knowledge and a subject of desire yeah okay cool so this was
actually as again you know i've kind of fallen into writing these papers on ai uh as i said i read the
zz article and felt inspired to explore the argument in a paper um this was this this this was from the
very first paper i actually did on ai um and i was trying to think about the way in which i wondered if
if we still use it this way i'm not sure if i think the theoretical arguments i make hold up but
i think there's perhaps more of a debate that could be made about its sort of relationship to ai
um one of the things i you know when i was first using ai to me it was almost like a brilliant google
like you know you use a google search and google's great you know we've had it for years we love it
we all use it um but you know you get you get millions of responses you get you get loads but
what was quite nice about ai was that it was like this source of knowledge in the sense that you could
say you know where's the best restaurant or somewhere or other or you could ask it summer
and most of the time it was just giving you a one you know one response it was giving you the
knowledge that you were looking for so this got me thinking about how this works because
obviously there's the famous you know lacan says that we want to know nothing uh that you know the
quiz the subject wants to know nothing more about it i.e that we don't want to know our symptoms we
don't want to know our unconscious which is part of the sort of um what would you call it the sort of
the paradox of psychoanalysis is that actually we probably don't want to change the fact that we keep
choosing the wrong partner because we get that sort of unconscious enjoyment out of
yeah we get the juicons we get the you know the fun of being with them and you know that's that's
where our uh our enjoyment our juice ones lies so that made me that really got me thinking because
i thought well hold on you know ai has been framed as this source of knowledge but we don't you know
according to lacan we don't actually want knowledge in that regard we're subjects of desire so i was i
was really interested in that and i couldn't make the connection i think i was looking back through my
notes and and lo and behold uh tom mcgowan had a chapter in his book on uh christopher nolan where
he explores the relationship between the subject of knowledge and the subject of desire in relation
to the film mementos and christopher nolan's film memento so for me that was this was again two ways
in which you could explore ai so one of the things to bear in mind with the subject of knowledge uh is
that the subject of knowledge is inherently uh somebody who's always looking to the future there are
there are hopeful subjects who is out there trying to engage with the world to get to garner knowledge
about it and collect that knowledge and become more knowledgeable okay so and again that kind of
makes sense is that not what academics are doing through their research you know scientists um even
you know late you know even somebody's non-academic who just wants to have more of an understanding
about a particular author or topic you go and you research it but lacan again just messes with that a
bit because he's saying we don't want knowledge of the truth we don't want knowledge of uh of certain
things so this starts now moving to desire and this is where we get the subject of desire for lacan
we're not knowledgeable subjects we are subjects of desire and by that what he's getting at is it's not
saying that we don't for instance uh seek the truth we don't for instance just live in ignorance and
you know stupidity and don't want knowledge some of us perhaps maybe do um but that actually our
path to knowledge and truth is distorted by the subject's desire um you know if i was to go into
psychoanalysis so you know i would probably you know and what was it about like it's not the fact
that i started reading g that's interesting you know what was the desire to read g jack that is more
interesting what was the distortion in the in the exploration of knowledge that played out um in in
that regard so this is really interesting because what it's saying is we're not like subjects here
trying to garner all this knowledge and understanding about an objective world that sits outside of us
and we can just collect objects and know about them but actually what it's saying is the two are far
more sort of implicated or interdependent that actual fact the subjects of desire our path for truth
and knowledge is distorted by that desire okay um and they started got me thinking because actually
it got me thinking about how you know desire and enjoyment and actually it's often what dissatisfies
us is where we get the most enjoyment from and what maintains that relationship to desire moving
more into the drive as well and in the paper yeah you start enjoying the failure yes yeah knowledge
yeah and this is this is wonderfully this is the argument i make in sport you know sport is you
know the win is not what you want it's you know you really okay everybody wants a win i'm not being
stupid but like you realize actually the failures of the fun of it type of thing um uh yeah i just i know
a bit on tangent but it was the most beautiful example so i was in double conference i was in dublin for
this conference and there's a team in the one thing i didn't get i think it was i didn't get it
was a gaelic sport i think it was hurling i think it was hurling the irish the gaelic sport they play in
ireland and there's a team in mayo that have lost a final i think 11 times 11 they've lost a final 11
times they got to the final they won it in 1951 and then they've been in 11 finals since then and
they've lost every single one they lost six in like a decade or something or other like these finals
and like they they and i was speaking to these uh these irish colleagues and they went it's even
better than that because like the most recent one in the semi-final they beat the unbeatable team
they just beat they were fantastic they beat the best team and then they went in the final and they
still lost so you know it was it was a bit it's i suppose a bit like the red socks isn't it you know
they didn't win the city the you know the the the what you call it the the baseball world championship
whatever uh you know for whatever 100 how many it got so yet so many years but you know i was trying
to say look like the second they do win it then they're not good they've lost what made it fun what
made it enjoyable um so it's that dissatisfaction it's the failure we enjoy but you know to get it back
to ai what i realized was the the whole premise of ai was not as a source of knowledge
you know it encouraged you to carry on it was actually playing or the way in which it was using
desire our desire not in a sense that it's like some being that can read our desire in the sense
that it's like it knows what we're thinking but what it was doing was it was an outlet for us to
read or to express our desire because you can ask it a question but then often it will come up say you
know do you want a bit more about this or you know um you know show me the best restaurant give me
the best 10 restaurants in toronto you know uh okay here's 10. do you want any more do you want
me to elaborate on one of them okay actually elaborate on the third one that was an indian
restaurant i want to know what that's you know why is that one good you know what's what's the food
there um so that for me was this really we had we don't we don't use ai as a source of knowledge but
we we relate to ai as subjects of desire uh our desire our knowledge is never fulfilled i agree i think
that's a very perspicacious point there because it's funny though like i think now uh because my
day job i'm a software engineer i do sometimes i remember i used to use when ai came out i used it
a bit for programming because it was a bit fun to ask it to you know write a function that divides an
array or whatever so something simple like that but then eventually i realized oh man this this thing is
making me deeply unproductive because what's happening is because it kind of hooks in your
desire you end up just prompting it questions all the time okay can i optimize the loop here can i uh
make this api call out this function use this uh whatever you know library and then you end up not doing
any work because it hooks in your desire whereas sometimes you just sit and focus and write the program
and it's still a really good program but you you're still a lot more productive writing the code
on your own because at least in this case it's just your stupid self doing the stupid programming
so i i found and after that i canceled all my air subscriptions i mean now more for like political
reasons i don't use it but i realized there's something very the way it yeah you're right i think
the way you point out in the paper it does uh expose a certain psychic structure and as the way we
engage with these ai agents yeah no that wonderful yeah perfect example yeah that's exactly you know
the lines i was thinking on and and i suppose if it's doing that then i suppose perhaps a more hopeful
point that i was trying to make the argument is okay you know and i i do i do borrow this a lot from
sort of like um like matthew fisleder who's like a great critical scholar of social media but it's also
like saying it's not inherently bad like you shouldn't just give up on social media like it is it can be
quite brilliant and wonderful um uh in that respect and i was kind of thinking the same about ai a little
bit i was like well it's not inherently bad ai so you know and it's clearly going to be something
that's there um you know it's now be it's now it's it's almost coming in well it's now inbuilt in
laptops isn't it so you know it i've had this discussion with with academics you know or you
were sort of pulling their hair out over students using ai and i'm like wow yeah but christ almighty
like it's like asking a student not to use you know i remember i remember you know when i was younger
you were told like if you did your homework you can't use the internet like you had to
so like well yeah this is ridiculous well okay we had encyclopedias i would go look at a book
but my god like if you said to us you now don't use the internet for research yeah and all that i
think here todd mcgovern i really like that he said this one of one of the streams he was on where
he doesn't care to use ai like he's like it's like use what we want to use um
oh god there's a no it's not sure i wish some students bloody did use
like i've had so much i've had some work from
all right give me some give me some name name and shame now i'm joking
i love almost yeah i despise people that criticize students i think it's the worst thing an academic
can do but there's some and i'm just like good god just run it you could have tidied your that
paragraph up you know i mean or so you at least got it you know checked and so i've tried to like
integrate it into my teaching there and i think yeah i don't really care yeah you could do what
there's some brilliant things so i do i have an assessment at the minute where the students have to
do um it's on a sports journalism module so they have to do like a feature article and i sort of said
like look they'll bloody ai can write them a phenomenal feature article so what i've incorporated
as part of the assessment is they have to then reflect on the article so they have to tell me
why they're using particular sources why they chose that opening why the narrative is that way what's
that building towards so it's getting to think critically of this you know of what it is they're
doing and i think that can still be used in academic essays all right okay fair enough ai might have
given you that source but what's the source doing you know i don't care what they're quoting i want
to learn the formal aspects of writing a care and our critical argument and again you can still
yeah yeah and perhaps because that's what ai won't be able to do if you know what i mean or that won't
it won't give it that that that personal you know that's what you assess in a student so i mean look
i think it's important to make that because i see we're talking about split subjectivity we're talking
about all these the contradictions in the subject desire whatnot and i think sometimes i find
now you may disagree with me here but maybe perhaps a caricature of kind of lacanian
psychoanalysis as we're talking of like desires and lack and all of this it can be a very it can
be a very cynical view of human nature oh well we don't we don't say those words like human nature but
of human beings i i i don't think that's the case though i think at the at the end of the day
i find at least with my very superficial understanding of these things is that psychoanalysis
is all of it's a very humanistic discipline it's in fact it's you could even argue it's a continuation
of the enlightenment project it's about reason it's about the ability that human beings have to
yes as you say kind of like to put it in just like very colloquial terms to reflect to kind of
be self-aware to a certain extent yeah no no yeah and i i think you're completely right i think if you
yeah if you if you was to take it at face value i think i think uh and because Patrick says something
yeah Lacan is a poet of lack like he's just a poetic of lack he's just he's just again pushing forward
lack you know nothing's nothing's complete nothing's whole and it you know that can that can be quite
negative i've you know i've really tried to like you know when i've tried to share psychoanalysis in
the sports world you know with with sports scholars okay it's take it takes what i find is you you know
it takes like a good 15 minutes just to get them to know what i mean by that like i'm not saying we're
all like you know you know idiots or we're all like we've got something missing or something like that
but it's to see it as a generative force in in our sense of being there has to there was there was
nothing for there to be something and that's where i think you know when you view it on an ontological
level that you know that makes that makes some really good points and i think one of my frustrations
with with sociologists is they don't ever really they're brilliant epistemology but they don't ever
really make connections to ontology and um in any in a sense that isn't just a post-modern sort of like
you know well there you know there isn't one or there is no one reality and they're all there are
all these constructions oh yes okay we know that but again as we were discussing earlier that it
might be because the reality is inconsistent that you get all those correct yeah i think it's where
again the slovenian school is just brilliant and yeah where they bring in and give in philosophy
because i mean mostly the whole my my understanding of it is from the you know bit of reading
phenomenology and bit of the science of logic is that it's this sort of the dialectic kind of moves
through the failure and the failure is what gives rise to something radically new you know to use the
term by i think this is johnson or the ontological incompleteness it's a it's a true thing and you put it
beautifully where yeah it is a it is an ontological reality that there's something new that can come out of
this what on the surface looks like something negative or perhaps even cynical no yeah yeah
yeah it's face value negative it looks cynical you know you know i mean it's the samuel beckett
quote i think isn't it you know fail again fail better like so yeah you know i mean you know and
that i mean that was fail again fail better yeah that's it yeah and that that to me was just
revolutionary like in how i looked at you know it's the argument i've made in relation to sport sport is
all about failure you you lose far more than you ever win in sport and when you do win the second
that trophy is won the next the next tournament starts technically and there's got to be a new
winner so you never really you never really accomplish anything like you know i've felt it
with writing and books as well that you know when i'm writing a paper like in my head i'm thinking best
paper in the world you know got to shut down the discussion this is it but actually then i read i read
it and then i finish it i read through it i absolutely ate it and then i know when i ate
it i have to send it off and then i have to write the next paper because when i read that paper when
it is out i think i just said that wrong or i didn't say that actually how i wanted to say it
so everything or it's a generative failure in that regard it's never nothing is ever complete or finished
or accomplished in that regard and that to me was just i can't express how on a personal level that
has that has helped me uh uh just just just relate to the world and it goes out beyond that
yeah if you if you if you engage with lakhan if you truly engage with lakhan you know we were talking
about you know mary riti mary rooty earlier you know look at her books you know i'm as i said i was
reading the book on penis envy at the minute yeah and it was just the way she talks about her own
personal relationships there with her mother and her father and how they have changed over the course
of her life like yeah it's it's it's it's it's not self-help but my god there's there's things
that have happened to me personally where i sort of you know you've got all the emotions and all
the anger and all the frustrations and all that and then you just sort of think well psychoanalysis
would say just look at it or you know or perhaps there's this is occurring for this reason or
perhaps you need to appreciate from this perspective because that's going on and it's just basic stuff
like that that it yeah it can be yeah it's it's a yeah yeah and again it helps it bloody helps and
yeah you can apply that theoretically to all the problems i believe that academia is exploring
i'm not sure if it was a pun you just used there you said it's uh generative so generative
ai we're talking about yes that's good yeah yeah it is generally well in our case the kind of uh
generativity we are talking of is what's it's really generative not the kind of the ai way just
takes information and kind of synthesizes and spits something out but this is something that's
radically generative it's funny uh i was i don't know if you know she's a great yeah hegelian scholar
uh katherine everett she does great oh yeah i had on the podcast uh recently she i saw a tweet by her i'll
put it on as an over for the for the viewer you'll see it now uh it's uh where there's like a meme
where there's this very depressed guy um that's saying uh dostoevsky novels uh nothing is solved
the world is a mess nothing is solved and then she says well make you you view the nothing is solved
optimistically and continuously and then you have hegel that's it so with hegel it's nothing is solved but
that's a good thing yes no she's brit yeah no no that that's a great that's it that's it that's
exactly it and that's i suppose that is the lubilana schools hegelian take on lacan which to me
just make look on they just made you know it makes it makes like hard make sense and then you understand
hegel as well it's like two for one it's brilliant and you can you can now and then you read these
these philosophers and scholars and you're like bloody hell that this is this is great but yeah no x twitter
is an awful place to be and i've i wonder if everyone should be following katherine everett and
i wonder if the only reason i'm still on is to see her memes like that i've i have noticed that it's
it's quite you know you know i think i stay on for i stay on for like egg and hamza's links uh because
there's always something there to like zizek or some new some new link which is great but um yeah and
katherine everett yeah there's still there's still a little bit of hope perhaps on twitter because you
you can still get great content like that but yeah yeah for for as they say for better or worse
um but uh look to weave this in yeah back to the your paper on on ai i think this is an important
point because we really didn't touch on this sort of how the technology is changing the modern subject
now i kind of want you to touch on that in this sense of course oh my god like this is probably discussed
ad nauseum the uh impact of the internet and social media uh human beings and yada yada right so
but you make an interesting point in fact maybe i'll just read it out though the way you conclude
uh the paper so it's a bit of a bit of a mouthful here so bear with me it says here
while it is under present circumstances while they acknowledge that sharp thoughts continue to lack
the intuitive understanding of social context that humans possess what ai chatbots reveal is that lying
is not simply about deception it is instead a very human tool for navigating complex social dynamics
maintaining relationships and preserving social harmony ultimately when faced with the straightforward
responses of the chatbot we are confronted with its ignorance of these social nuances whereas the
honesty and ongoing improvements in ai technology may offer advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency
such uh embracement belies certain uniquely human qualities namely our capacity to lie and i this is how you
conclude it but then you also make this point you say i i think i can't get find that except i try to find it
well while you're talking but the notion that well by us interacting with ai bots or ai agents in some sense
this uniquely human capacity to lie we might lose it and that for you would be in some sense a tragedy
because by losing that capacity to lie we also miss out on these social nuances that very much makes us
human and kind of puts up and puts us in this uh interconnected symbolic network yeah no yeah i think i
think yeah i think if we end up lying like like for everything we said in this talk for everything the
paper says is if we end up lying like ai then there's we've lost the subject the authentic lie the the lie that
makes us subjects uh yeah that to me would be well it'd be the end of the subject that yeah then then
ai is one and i suppose the only you know we talk i'm talking there we're talking here about something
that you know might it could happen say whatever in the future but you know i think it's there for
instance when you know i have said to colleagues before they were like well are there any ai checkers
out there to see if like to use the example of students again are students using ai and i sort of said
look if you play around with ai you know you know i've been teaching for over you know like easily over
like 10 years now like i can tell i can tell when they've used ai because there's a tone to it
they they're not writing like you know subjects they're not writing like students um they all
write like people on linkedin yes yes yeah there's a real yeah to me there's a real tone to it to me
the only way this is no disrespect to any north americans but it does have like an american sort of
like hey there you know sort of like little tone to it that sort of kicks like is there in the
writing style you know it relies upon certain words it loves the word dell doesn't it like
you know i had a student who i know uh phc student who i know wasn't using it but and she'd used
dell and i went you went expel expel that word from this you know because you know it to me it's like
i'm thinking uh yeah and and then she was like oh god right is that really true i was like yeah it
loves the certain words and obviously it might get better where that's the case but you can you know
what's being lost there is the capacity to write and and speak and articulate yourself like a subject
which comes with all the nuances and the inconsistencies of of being a subject so you
know each writer has a certain structure and form to their writing that won't always necessarily
you know and i'm not saying you know we'll have a tone to i you know i'd argue you know for me you
know one of the problems i'd argue my writing is i tend i might i might elongate a sentence a bit too long
but that's but that's how you know it's me writing okay that's how you know it that's my and i work
on it and i'll try and make it clearer uh but at the same time you know other writers can write very
clearly but for me i find it a bit like it's a bit sentencing it's a bit you know what i mean
there's there's little bits like a human resources person it writes yes yeah and i think if we yeah
yeah definitely linkedin i'm on linkedin purely purely for because i have to be professionally
but it's what my good god what are these like how do these people do it some people are so
on there and it's all like it's all like the way people talk and like congratulate each other it's
it's it's i can't you know and the point there is that if you spend you know i've got people at work
i want to go to them be like you don't sound like you do when you're speaking to me you sound weird
like when you're on linkedin and then they'll probably be like oh i know i know very well but
nevertheless i have to do it because i need to promote this project or you know i'm having to do
that yeah that's yeah i'm like you know someone will do something they'll be like congratulations
great i'm like you hate that person i know for a fact you hate that person yeah it's very it's a
very it's an ai world really linkedin um oh yeah yeah um and i think you know people talk about
yeah i will take our jobs and all of that i mean i hope it does i wanted to take our jobs i mean
those kinds of jobs who want a job like that to make linkedin marketing content posts yeah and it's
i mean this is i mean this is you know i mean the was that not the purpose of technology like you know
i mean i mean my parents i don't know like in the uk like my parents you know the big thing in the 50s
and 60s you know there would be a three-day week as time went on we'd only have a three-day working
week because technology would be doing most of this for us and that you know doesn't happen we
actually we work more now yeah we are thomas piccoli writes on this we're busier than we've ever been
yeah yeah and you know and that's because these things have become they're privatized you know that's
the problem with ai it's privatized you know if you were able to you know perhaps if they were like
nationally or socially or you know makes the argument communistically owned like there was a
world ai then yeah the money you know then we would the ii would be making profit and we could share
the profit out and we could work less you know we'd have a we'd have the end with each yeah right
this is not this is kind of delays in view of technology kind of yes you are but i think here's
where i mean just to connect todd mcgovern capitalism and desire comes in i mean we probably need
need to kind of analyze even ai through which kind of is what you're doing through the uh the mcgovern
desire lens in in this case um yeah yeah so i haven't i haven't actually read i haven't read his
new book he's got his new book and he's that the capitalism and desire books yeah it's supposed to be
part two for capitalism and desire the yes yeah i've read capitalism and desire so i will say i will
i will get around to reading it but yeah i mean yeah yeah the brilliance of his work there is that
he makes yeah he links he links obviously uh he links desire to capitalism but what i think he's doing
there and obviously he's drawing upon lacan is he's sort of developing marks in the sense that he makes
that psychic connection there to to to capitalism uh obviously you know surplus value surplus enjoyment is
is this is the is the is the the brilliance of lacan and yeah opens up a whole new world of
relating to of exploring capitalism in that way as well um which is really interesting um all right uh
jack i think to kind of maybe conclude with a bit of a fun speculative question yeah since we're talking
about ai and of course psychoanalysis i have to ask this uh if you could imagine this do you think a machine
because okay let me let me rephrase i still believe that psychoanalysis is a very much materialist
discipline it's a materialist uh it's not this and there's no idealism or platonism it's very
materialistic uh or materialist sorry in that sense so therefore i've got to ask a do you think a machine
can have an unconscious oh uh my god uh a fun speculative question yeah no this is wonderful
you know what no no i don't think it can but i do think that we sort of uh i do think we we're
creating we create films like films have explored that and we somehow seem to just be creating them we
we somehow seem to be on this path where we're creating fantasies and fictions that eventually
come true i saw a brilliant meme today that was saying like don't look up you know the film don't
look up is it is adam mckay i think directed it um i got the name wrong uh obviously the one and the
one where the the the name was like you know that i can't remember when that came out was it during
covid or whatever but uh in that also you've got the power you've got the tech billionaire who's
telling the president american president and the cabinet what they should be doing so what's going
on now elon and trump yeah i mean i i just hadn't thought that's all this meme and you know you don't
you just stop and go you know like jesus yes it's happening so so i don't know uh i mean blade
runner 2049 like the most is it 2049 i forget again i'm gonna get the title wrong yeah the most recent
blade runner um i think yeah yeah yeah 2049 yeah i've got it yeah um i mean my god yeah i mean if
that if that film is not about a machine garnering some form of not necessarily consciousness but you
know there's so many bits in that film that i'm almost certain vilna's red lacan because he makes
so many reference to like gaps and cuts and stuff like a cut i think there's a line in there where they
talk about it you know if if this you know if if the robots have been able to have children then
you know that is devastating for the subject so i don't know yeah probably maybe a machine will have
an unconscious in the future and yeah i mean it's a fun thing to kind of just speculate on because
it's really interesting i in fact have had many people working in uh embodied cognitive science
that right yeah sing on ai uh through even phenomenology you know mary small pointy
and they very much bring the notion of uh embodiment the body and the notion of inactivism
but what's funny is we have in lacanian theory it's it's it's so much about language it's it's about
it's about free association and psychoanalysis and language and then currently kind of big
almost paradigm in ai is in fact language models but nonetheless there's something really odd that
we these language models are nothing like what you'd think a human subject would be in how we use
language so it's like yes you can talk of ai through these other uh let's call it a philosophical
lenses or cool kits like phenomenology or cognitive science but uh the the thing that is most practical
in some sense is at this moment language and then maybe you you went through the kenyan theory we're
like oh wow the what we thought language was was something totally different to uh to what you know
perhaps what something like linguistics would tell us no definitely yeah definitely and you know the
hegelian point to make there is everything's mediated like i do struggle with like embodiment
work um in in the book on sport i actually really critique like embodiment and phenomenological
perspectives of sport because for me it ignores or bypasses or doesn't give enough attention to
the fact that these you know that phenomenological asset is always mediated so it's always symbolically
mediated it's always you know it goes through a symbolic order in that respect
so yeah no no i completely agree that like uh
you know lacan lacan focuses on language so he's looking at the mediation but it's not it's not like
a it's not like a as he he's saying he's like specific about language in relation like to what
we've been discussing and that's slightly different and i think yeah that's interesting to look at that
in regards to ai which is yeah i agree i'm glad that you said i mean obviously i haven't read your book on
um sports and psychoanalysis it's not it's not i've only just finished it it's not out yet oh yeah
i thought it was already out gotcha yeah this is yeah sorry this is my problem so it's under review
at the minute i finished it in i finished it in november or i think i finished it in november that
was last year's project really um so it's just under review at the minute so yeah it's a book on sport
and psychoanalysis specifically lacan and sport how can lacanian concepts be used to understand sport
um yeah i'm glad you mentioned that because i was going to ask what are the kind of your
in-flight projects and what can you expect from you in the future yeah uh yeah so there's so
there's that the book as well is actually like probably most books it's it's a
i don't know i'm not i'm not i'm not esteemed enough to have two volumes to a book but there
is actually a so the first bit is essentially introducing lacanian ideas so i look at all the
unconscious desire drive juissance uh fantasy and i also draw a lot upon i was heavily influenced and
absolutely love uh uh robert fallon's work on interpassivity um and in particular well i was
quoting so many times i should have it on the tip of my tongue probably behind us uh but he's
the pleasure principle in culture uh that book so i i draw yeah i finished drawing upon interpassivity
because i think that's a great way of exploring sport and our relationship to the other of the
big other being another concept that's used so that's that's sort of like setting the stall that
book where it's these are all the locating concepts we can use and then the next book where
i'm working on is i want to focus more it's going to be more like um well the idea at the minute
it might change because i haven't actually started writing it or anything yet is i want it to be more
like essay based so i want to take like topics in sport so for instance i want to look at like uh
var um apologies just need to plug in my laptop it's going to go off so i want to look at like var in uh
in particular it's used so that that's the video assistant referee uh in football at the minute in the
and how a topic like that can be explored through lacanian concepts so it'll be more topic based the
second the second book so i just want to yeah dive into an issue yeah there's one
through lacanian theory have people really analyzed the phenomena of sport because i mean
for goodness sake and forget ai sport is just it's it's something almost
innate to what it means to be human there was there was um
um the thing i'll say no no one's used like lacanian sport before it's been dribbled in in
certain respects um but it was wonderful it's how i got to know him you know everyone please go and
read um there's a great paper by joseph ronoso uh uh boston sucks in psychoanalysis culture and society
and uh he had that published and in that he's looking at the relationship between lack desire and drive in
relation to sport and in particular like sporting rivalries and at the time i just um it was at the
time it was in publication it hadn't come out yet but um previously that i've been asked by a friend
to to write a chapter for a book on football and i wanted to do something on english like being an
english football fan of the english national team and the fact that we always lose on penalties or we
always lose finals and so naturally i was thinking i was thinking in very similar ways to joe i was
thinking how you know there's something about the drive of the old the desire the fantasies and
that so um when i saw it it was beautiful i read joe's paper and i was just like oh my god like this
is exactly what i've been thinking so from that i ended up emailing him uh we ended up meeting online
a few times and i said in my work and from that we were like look let's let's put something together
on sport and psychoanalysis so we did the special issue in psychoanalysis culture and society and then
we did the edited collection uh sport and psychoanalysis what sport reveals about unconscious
desires fantasies and fears um and i know he's still working in the area we've got to be presenting
at the lat conference in march uh next month where we've got a stream on sports we're going to be
presenting with ryan lengley uh as well looking at that so you know what we found when we did the
special issue is that there's there's a there's a space for it because we you know the reason why we
did the special issue and then the edit collection was because we had so many article submissions um
to the special issue that there was there was enough to continue it into into an edited collection
as well and what was quite nice was when we were doing the special issue you want i think you know
we we could only take through i think 12 articles or 13 or 13 articles and our first 13 i looked at it
and it was all american sport i was like look we can't have a special issue that's just american sports
so we really have to like yeah so we it was a real what i'm trying to get you know there was
under the article the submissions we got was so good but it was like finding a a decent collection
because we needed you know we didn't want it all to be like calm so we needed to spread a theory we
needed to spread a geography but then we also needed to spread a sport as well because we couldn't
have it all about i think one of them like the first again a second round it was all american football
and i'm like again like that's too much so yeah we were able to spread them out across the two
publication outlets the the book and the thing but so is anybody doing yeah people are doing it
now and then there's a world out there i think of people you know i don't i think one thing i'm
trying to do is bring psychoanalysis into sport into sports research into scholarly you know more
sociology perhaps sports psychology as well through sociology it's a fantastic yeah yeah so try to make
yeah yeah try to make those sort of links and bridges i think the thing that the thing is that
but there's but there's loads of psychoanalysis psycho analysts out there who who have who like
sport and i think hopefully what this is collection is doing is like you can use those ideas that you
might be using in the clinic or you might be using in other work to make sense of sport in that regard
i think i was told i think i'm told by yeah person that loves this theory stuff it's just i mean i
especially the drive i can't think of a better arena to apply the concept of the drive than sport yeah
yeah well i i was speaking to a lacanian and and they actually said that they were like how do you
apply in lacan to sport and i was like the drive yeah i was like i know you know the drive and i was
like just think about it like and and they were like oh right yeah i suppose you know yeah and uh so
yeah i think it's ripe for psychoanalytic investigation so yeah there was i think there
was in the 80s there was like i forget the author there was a book written in french that applied i
think were con to psychoanal but the book is like way out of print like i couldn't get a copy i don't
speak french either so um yeah so i i feel like awfully you know due to poor publication you know uh that
book's been lost a little bit but hopefully you know in that case i will just pick it up yeah you can
relay back and drop and we're just picking it up you can resurrect it um yeah great i mean i'll email
you afterwards chuck and then certainly would love to leave the links in the show notes uh for any of
the obviously interested uh which i'm sure there'll be a lot and again even the book is out because you
said it's still the publication i'd love to invite you on again to discuss specifically sports and
psychoanalysis because again for someone that's kind of i always think of this i always think of people
that are kind of interested in maybe let's say jack or icon but really what are these guys talking
about if for me i always think of where where can the phenomena where can we apply it into a phenomena
in the real world so i think of let's say film or even interpersonal relationships certainly but then
sport is a fantastic arena to apply this to yeah definitely definitely it's it's you know i say the book
you know sports all about failure it's all about the inconsistencies it says something about being
a subject sport that necessarily perhaps hasn't been looked at in that way before um and you can
hate sport as well like i always say my work is sport of a little s because you know there's so much
about sport that i actually despise yet why on earth am i going to see my team on sunday you know
what i mean like why why what is you know why am i handing off over money to um to you know especially
in a period of very bad form that i'm just like oh like what is that that drive to do so that that
jouissance that i'll subject myself to um yeah but then the direct response to that would be
well you if you think oh what is this silly thing where people are kicking a ball around and like
why are you obsessed if you start asking that question if you don't see why people do that it
makes you the idiot to not see why people are in the symbolic uh kind of the fiction exactly and
i'll get this in this probably worse like like gx you know a master you know uh you know the one
thing i'll always adore the man was he's he's opened up this theoretical door for me into lacan and
everything but he's made that claim he's he hasn't followed his own like he says he refers the only
reference i think he's ever made to sport was in like an interview on like slovenian radio where they
were asking him about like slovenia i think slovenia were in got into the euros european
championship that year and he says our sport it's just stupid you know he talks about ski
and he goes you go up a hill and then you just go down it what a stupid thing to do like
i know i know and i was like i was like are you kidding me man like this is you know this is but
yeah that's and that's his brilliance but um yeah of course but it is a stupid you know it's absolutely
you know i was at this conference and i said i said i said they were talking about online abuse
and i went well sport is no wonder sport is a site for online abuse sport is abusive not only to
ourselves you know no one tells me to go run 10 kilometers like but i'm gonna damage my you know
okay yes it's good for my health but i will damage myself eventually like doing like like running like
you see any former athlete they don't walk properly they never that's one thing i always notice they
never walk properly and uh yeah and i i know people that i know two people that have nearly
killed themselves from running and that's not like i don't mean like running into a car or getting hit
by no from the actual act of running they have nearly killed themselves like so you know i'm sat there
going well i don't think we should be running so i was like sport is abusive like coach relationships
are abusive you know what i mean like don't you know go faster like like work harder like when you're
sweating and on the way yeah um yeah jack this has been really fun thank you so much for your time
today this has been nothing but absolute pleasure pleasure thank you so much for inviting us the
questions were brilliant it's been yeah it's been brilliant as i said i've been i've had a flu for
about five weeks i was so this has really cheered me up so that's hard that's great to hear in fact
back to felix mutual because as you know i have a sign of the weather too uh but now as i was saying
uh for sure i'd love to do it again yes i will get in contact with yeah i'll keep obviously the
book's under review so whatever will happen will happen with that book but yeah more than happy to
