And let me begin by saying that you will notice the presence of a number of cameras in the room.
This is being recorded by a project called Voices from Oxford.
And nearly a decade ago, the Voices from Oxford project, that's one word, Voices from Oxford, you can find it easily on the internet, recorded an absolutely seminal debate between two great dinosaurs of evolutionary biology.
In the blue corner, Richard Dawkins, and in the red corner, Lynn Margulis, the great champion of symbiogenesis.
That debate went on for four hours without a resolution.
And as I said, it's all recorded by Voices from Oxford.
And we're very grateful to the Voices from Oxford team for recording today's lecture too.
I'm going to tell you that physiology guides evolution.
You see, physiological scientists were almost excluded from evolutionary biology by a very simple idea, which is the blind watchmaker.
That the processes that generate change in organisms which can be inherited are totally blind to function.
And, of course, physiological and medical analysis inevitably has to deal with function.
So how did we get into this situation?
And the way I'm going to explain that is to compare the 20th century reductive approach in biological and medical science.
Blind chance for variation, followed by natural selection.
Evolution, therefore, has no foresight.
With what inevitably I call a 21st century approach.
And I call it an integrative approach because I think it is much more integrative than reductive.
And the take-home message I'm going to give you is very simply this.
That there is, of course, blind chance.
The variations at a molecular level are indeed unguided.
But organisms harness that stochasticity, that randomness to produce function, as we'll see.
And the talk is divided into two parts.
First of all, harnessing stochasticity, then how that is used in enabling organisms to respond to stress in the environment in which they live
or produced by other organisms to lead to genome reorganization.
And then I'll finish with the question, was the watchmaker at least one-eyed rather than blind?
So, the question with which we'll begin is how did the integrative approach to life become sidelined during the 20th century?
Let me make clear that I greatly admire the reductionist approach.
I've been a reductionist myself in very much of the work that I do on ion channels in cells in the heart.
But it's an oversimplified view of living organisms.
And we all use this mantra, don't we, from molecules to man.
And you notice the directionality in that, a one-way process.
And the problem is, this can't be true.
Because molecules are not alive.
If I took the DNA out of a cell, and I put it in a Petri dish with as many nutrients as you like,
I could keep it for 10,000 years, it would do absolutely nothing.
Same applies to heart rhythm.
If I take all the molecular mechanisms that generate the transport of ions across the cell membrane,
together with, again, as many nutrients as you like, there would be no cardiac rhythm.
The rhythm is generated as a consequence of an interaction.
So, it's cells, tissues, organs and systems that are alive through the processes that they generate.
So, how do we ever get into the situation in which people thought otherwise?
Well, it goes all the way back to the great French philosopher Ren√© Descartes in about 1664.
In a treatise on the fetus, he wrote,
If I knew enough of what was in the semen,
I would be able to predict the behaviour of the adult organism.
That's 1664.
And then Laplace repeated the same kind of message about the universe as a whole.
If a highly intelligent being, of course, some people might think of that as God.
I don't know what your theism is.
I don't want to worry about that.
But if a highly intelligent being could see the equations of motion going forwards,
they could also see them going backwards.
Such a being would have a view, a totally clear view of what has happened in the past and what would happen in the future.
And so, this leads us to the great quantum mechanician Schrodinger.
And Schrodinger, in 1943, gave a famous set of lectures at the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies,
published as a book called What is Life?
And he pointed out, first of all, that physics is the generation of order from disorder.
And what he meant by that is this, that at the molecular level, like the gas molecules in this room,
there would be stochasticity, the random motion that is produced by any molecules that have kinetic energy.
In other words, not at an extremely low temperature.
But, of course, if the gas molecules are constrained, as the ones in this room are, by the walls of the room,
or in a balloon, for example, something very interesting happens.
You then get the beautifully smooth, determinate laws of thermodynamics of pressure, volume, and temperature.
So, physics, he said, was order from disorder.
But then, he said, but biology is different.
It's order, at a high level, from order at the molecular level.
Now, how could he think that?
He thought that because he made a very important and an absolutely correct prediction,
which is that the genetic material, when it was found, it wasn't known in 1943 that it was DNA,
but when it was found, it would be found to be what he called a non-periodic crystal.
And if you think of a long polymer, in this case, of course, of the nucleic acids,
as it were a kind of crystal, then it's certainly non-periodic.
That's how it contains information.
And so, I think, remember, these were the days in which x-ray crystallography was being used
by people like Dorothy Hodgkin to work out the structure of vitamin B12,
and many other people using x-ray crystallography,
as indeed did Watson, Crick, and Wilkins, and Franklin later on to determine the structure of DNA,
to determine the structure of molecules.
So, I think he thought that that means that the reading of the genetic material
would be a completely determinate process.
Now, there's no way in which that can be true either.
Does biology generate order from order?
Or, if you take the opposite view, which I do in both of my little books on this,
Music of Life and the book that's just come out,
and available at the back there, there's the end of the advertisement.
Anyway, if you take the view I take,
it's that biology also mostly, and most of the time,
has to generate order functionality from disorder at the bottom level,
because there's no way in which the molecules of a biological system
can avoid the stochasticity that molecules generally show
if they have kinetic energy,
which means that they are at a high enough temperature.
And we can prove that with physiological and biochemical experiments,
because stochasticity is a key feature of gene expression.
So, I'm going to come on now to harnessing stochasticity.
Very interesting study done just a few years ago by Sui Huang and his colleagues,
in which they investigated the amount of gene expression of a particular protein,
doesn't matter what the protein is, actually SCA1,
but you can do this with almost any protein,
and you look at how the gene expression levels vary
in the different cells of the same population.
So, they've all derived from the same genome.
It's a clonal population.
And what you find is, as you can see at the top there,
that there's great stochasticity.
How great? In this case, it's 1,000-fold.
The expression at the highest expression level
is 1,000 times the expression at the low expression level
in different cells.
Moreover, we can prove that this is a cell,
or rather, multi-cell level attractor.
Because if you go on to do these interesting experiments,
in which you take populations, for example,
that have a simple bell-shaped distribution curve,
and you clone from the high expression cells,
you will find that initially, they indeed do express at the high level,
but within a week of the cells reproducing themselves,
and producing a larger and larger population,
you're back to the original population.
It's an attractor.
It's the property of the population as a whole.
The population as a whole,
I don't know why this particular population
is producing this particular distribution,
but it's as though it's saying,
and I'm anthropomorphizing here,
I need this distribution.
Why should they, why should cells need that?
Just incidentally, if you have a population that is bimodal,
and you clone from one of the peaks,
again, you get the same result.
Initially, the cells follow the peak
from which they were generated,
but eventually you come back to the bimodal distribution.
That also, therefore, is a population attractor.
So, the question then arises,
how can stochasticity be used by organisms functionally?
And the answer is very simple.
That provides a range of expression
to enable response to stress.
So, organisms with populations that are diverse,
just through natural selection
of those cells that are most appropriate
for the challenge that they find,
those will survive and reproduce.
So, you only need to add natural selection
within the organism, in this case,
to arrive at a clear way
in which the range of expression
can be used in turn to produce functionality.
But then the question is,
how do cells feed information from the environment
to control the genome?
You see, if we represented a molecule
as big as my hand,
and you ask the question,
where is the cell membrane
in which that molecule sits,
it would be somewhere up in Aberdeen
or down in Bordeaux.
Cells are that big
viewed from a molecule.
So, how on earth
does a signal
right up at the cell surface
several on this scale
hundreds of miles away
get transmitted down to the genome
to tell it what to do?
And, of course,
people once thought
that was impossible.
That's why people like Richard Dawkins
write, you know,
sealed off from the outside world
as what you can say
about the genome.
Well, the answer is
that physiologists and biochemists
have beautifully worked this out.
I'll take only one example.
This happens to be an example
from one of my former collaborators,
Dick Chen,
now working in New York University.
And what they did
was to show
that the entry of calcium
through some channels
right at the surface membrane,
so that's way up in Aberdeen,
can then trigger
a biochemical cascade
which then produces
is a molecule
that can be attached
to one of the motors
that goes down
on the tubules
to be transmitted
right the way down
to the nucleus.
And that can be,
that information
can be specific.
So the answer is
the microfilaments
form the roadway,
the communication line,
and it's possible,
and it's possible,
therefore,
for, in this case,
the genome
to know
about microevents
right up there
in Aberdeen
or way down
in Bordeaux.
So there's no,
there are many other studies
of this kind.
I just quoted one.
So there's no problem
any longer
in understanding
how cells can sense
the environmental challenge,
as they do,
for example,
with the immune system,
and how that can be
triggered
to produce change
in the genome
and in gene expression
and even
to direct mutation.
And that's the big thing
that was forbidden
by the modern synthesis
neo-Darwinist view
of evolution.
And we all know
how that happens.
It happens
in many cases
by targeted
hypermutation.
I'm going to give
one example
from the immune system
and then
indicate
with a few examples
how it also occurs
in whole organisms
and how does it work.
Well, immunologists
have known this
for very many years.
If you take
the sequence,
either the genome sequence
or the protein sequence
for an immunoglobulin,
there are two parts to it.
One,
V,
is the variable part
of the protein.
The other part,
which gives its
immunoglobulin
characteristic,
enables it to function
as an immunoglobulin,
doesn't change.
The mutation
that is triggered
by the signal,
in this case
by an antigen arriving,
of course,
is restricted.
to the variable region.
That's where
the functionality
comes in.
It's stochastic,
so far as we know,
you know,
as the wheel
turns there,
it's random.
But what is not random
is the targeting.
It's only
to that region
of the genome.
Now,
one other thing
to say,
that change
in frequencies
looks like a simple
curve here
at the moment,
but that change
in frequency,
of course,
can be up to
100,000 times normal,
even up to
a million times normal.
So it's a huge
hypermutation.
If that was happening
in the genome
as a whole,
the organism
wouldn't survive,
and you and I
would not survive
because our
immune systems
would not be able
to be sufficiently
selective.
If you want
to follow up
on that,
I got that
particular diagram
from this
beautiful review
by Odegaard
and Schatz.
As they say,
somatic hypermutation
needs to be
targeted specifically
to immunoglobulin
genes,
and moreover,
to only the
variable part
of the immunoglobulin
genes.
It's not targeted
every way.
You can begin
to see,
therefore,
where my concept
of there being
a kind of
one-eyed view
of the situation,
a directional view,
is coming from.
So,
I see this
as a bit like
the old-fashioned
fruit machine.
This is a fruit machine
opened up
to reveal
its cogs and wheels,
and of course,
what you used to do
was to put a coin
or two in,
spin the wheels,
hoping to get
three lemons
or three pineapples
or whatever it is.
And of course,
if you've got
two lemons,
let's say,
and you wanted
a third,
what you would do
would be to hold
the two lemons
constant.
You'd put more coins
in to spin
the third wheel
until eventually
you've got a lemon.
Well, of course,
you might find
that you spend
more money doing
that than what
you get out.
Evolution is a bit
different, though.
It always wins.
Well,
not quite always.
Of course,
species die out
and so on.
So,
you take my
remark
there with
a pinch
of salt.
Now,
we come to
that in,
of course,
evolution
of cellular
genomic
information
in response
to stress
in cells
in a particular
organism.
That is not
necessarily
transmitted
down through
future generations.
Now,
I'm coming on
to the last
examples I'm
going to give
in the talk,
which is
examples that
organisms
do rearrange
genomes,
and we've
known that.
They do so
in response
to stress.
We've known
that for more
than 70 years.
The great
American
biologist,
Barbara McClintock,
showed that
way back in the
1930s,
working on
corn,
she was able
to watch
how parts of,
of course,
she didn't know
about DNA
in those days,
not that it was
genetic code,
but she observed
parts of the
chromosome here
moving to
incorporate itself
in a different
chromosome,
in corn.
In 1957,
she was warned
that the papers
she was publishing
on this were not
to be believed,
and it would be
better if she
no longer published
on that.
30 years later,
at the age of 81,
1983,
she received
the Nobel Prize
precisely for
mobile genetic
elements.
If anybody ever
tells you that
the genome is
actually isolated,
as Richard Dawkins
tells us,
from the outside
world,
the answer is
it was shown
that it is not
as long ago
as 70 years ago,
and it won
a very important
Nobel Prize
for medicine.
Why did
the Nobel Prize
committee end
up giving her
the prize?
Because everybody
else had found
it too.
And she wrote
a very perceptive
article in
Science.
This was her
Nobel Prize
lecture.
She wrote,
we will
have a greater
appreciation of
its,
that's the genome's
significance,
as a highly
sensitive organ
of the cell.
She got the
idea right.
Something,
she didn't know
what was
responding in
those cells
and enabling
their chromosomes
to rearrange
in response
to a challenge
in the environment.
If that sounds
familiar,
inheritance of
acquired
characteristics,
you can see
where I'm coming
from.
And we can
prove that
that must have
happened in
evolution.
Because if you
go to the
paper published
in Nature
on the
sequencing
of the
human genome
celebrated in
2001 with
great fanfare
on both
the American
side,
think those
were the days
of presidents
like Bill
Clinton,
and over here
it might have
been Tony Blair.
I think it must
have been.
You know,
they both
announced this
great achievement.
At last we're
reading the book
of life,
the genome
was sequenced.
Well,
deep in those
papers you'll
find a very
interesting comparison.
This is actually
from chromatin
protein sequences
and each of
these little
icons,
if you like,
is a particular
protein domain
and of course
has a particular
DNA sequencing
coding for it.
Each of those
is functional.
Now the
interesting thing
is you go
from yeast
to worm
to fly
and right
the way
up to
the human
you observe
not just
gradual
accumulation
of point
mutations,
whole domains
have moved
around the
genome.
I'm going
to highlight
them now.
They are
ones that
have been
as it were
brought in
by accretion,
by a response
to the
environment,
a reorganization
of the
domains
that make
up this
kind of
protein.
And here
they all
are.
There are
many of
them.
Now what's
the significance
of that?
I like to
think of it
rather like
giving two
children
Lego bricks
and to
one child
you give
the original
Lego bricks,
the little
ones,
that had to
be laboriously
put together
to build an
arch or a
column or
whatever it
might be
as an
architectural
feature.
And to
the other
child you
give preformed
arches and
you ask them
to build a
bridge.
This is
indeed
incidentally
is an
image of
a Lego
bridge.
You know
it is
blindingly
obvious that
the child
that's got
the preformed
bits will
get their
fastest and
that's exactly
what evolution
has done.
That's why
evolution does
what Eldridge
and Gould
showed way
back in
about
1972
with their
concept of
punctuated
equilibrium
because you
see what
the fossil
record shows
us is that
over long
periods,
even hundreds
of millions
of years,
species can
stay pretty
constant.
That's the
period of
stasis.
But there
can be
periods,
10 million
or so years,
in which
there's rapid
mutation.
I think
that evolution
is playing
just like
the children
with the
Lego bricks
and getting
there much
faster.
So it's
not, as the
original
neo-Darwinist
synthesis said,
always gradual
accumulation of
point mutations.
Now, there are
examples where
that is true.
Hemoglobins are
a very good
example where
we can trace
the accumulation
of point
mutations.
The point is
it's not always
like that.
Now, one or two
examples to finish
with.
I'm going to
take this
mostly from
bacteria.
This is a
lovely example
where the
response to
stress leads,
in this case,
in response to
chemotherapy,
drugs and
antibiotics,
to the rapid
evolution of
genome change
in response to
unfavorable
environments.
And we know,
as medical
people, that
this is what's
giving the world
a health scare.
The antibiotics
are producing,
precisely,
this kind of
response.
And I'll show
in a moment
how rapid
the change
can be in
response to
a challenge
from the
environment at
the level of
bacteria.
This does it.
This is a study
that was published
just a year or
so ago.
It's actually
a team working
in Reading.
And what they
did, they took
bacteria that
have got
swimmer for
jelly, swimming,
around, with
their flagelli
waving around
to swim around.
And they
removed the
DNA for one
of the
regulatory
proteins in
the network
that switches
the flagella
production on.
So, you get
bacteria with
no flagelli.
They can't
swim around.
You then allow
them to breed.
within four
days, the
flagelli are
back.
Now, remember,
they didn't
knock out
the DNA
for the
flagelli
themselves.
I think if
they'd done
that, you
could predict
it might be
a thousand
years before
they came
back.
Four days.
How was that
done?
a totally
different
regulatory
network
normally
involved in
nitrogen
synthesis,
sorry, nitrogen
metabolism,
was, as
it were,
recruited with
indeed some
mutations, but
here's where the
targeted hypermutation
must be coming in
because those
mutations weren't
everywhere in the
genome, which
enabled that
regulatory
mechanism, that
regulatory network,
to take over
the function of
triggering the
production of
flagelli.
That's four
days, and that
gives us pause
for thought, and
that's why bacteria
can manage to do
things very
quickly.
One final
example, this
is from another
very recent
paper.
Quite a lot of
this work is very
recent.
I'm referring, you
see, in this
talk to one
work that was
shown way back
70-odd years
ago, as with
Barbara McClintock,
but also showing
how recent
experimental work
has fully
confirmed many
of the things
that she and
other biologists
claimed was
incompatible with
the standard
theory of
evolution.
And what
Jack and his
colleagues conclude
in this article
in PNAS is that
cells possess
specific mechanisms
to optimise
their genome
in response
to the
environment.
So, I'm
going to
conclude now and
leave plenty of
time for
questions and
comment and
discussion.
Was the
watchmaker
blind?
Well, you
know, watchmakers
usually don't use
both eyes.
they are usually
squinting down
a tiny, you
know, playing
around with the
mechanism to
see.
And so, I
rather think that
we can say that
the watchmaker,
well, he was
one-eyed, he
knew whereabouts
in the genome he
should work.
And here's
another one,
again, using
the one-eyed
approach.
I say one-eyed
because, of
course, this is
not somebody
saying, well,
we need to
evolve arms
and legs in
creatures that
need arms and
legs that used
to have fins,
and therefore we
will do it in
the following
way.
It's not full
vision in the
sense that
somebody can
draw up the
blueprint and
give that to
the evolutionary
process.
The reason I
call it one-eyed
is that organisms
themselves did
the seeing, but
they didn't do
so in a way
that made it
possible to see
immediately what
to do.
They saw how
to harness
stochasticity with
targeted mutation
in order to
produce the
consequences which
we see today,
which is the
evolutionary process
that's produced
us.
So, one
final advertisement
which is to the
book that's
available at the
back.
It's only just
been published a
month or so
ago, and
you're welcome
to purchase
copies or just
take notes down
about it, if
you wish, after
the lecture and
discussion.
And that's the
end of my talk.
I could say much
more, and there's
much more in the
book, but I hope
I've said enough
to convince you
that the world
of physiology and
medical research
is back and
seen to be
highly relevant
to the
evolutionary
process and
therefore to the
study of
evolutionary
biology.
Thank you very
much, and I'm
open to questions,
criticisms, comments,
and so on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
applause
Thank you.
