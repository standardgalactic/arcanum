welcome everyone to another episode of the lectern i'm john vervakey and i'm joined here
with somebody who's become a good friend he's a colleague we do quite a bit of showing up
together at places where neoplatonism is a topic of discussion he's written an amazing series of
books on the imagination i'm using his text the iconic imagination in my upcoming course
on the cognitive science of the imagination realizing the imaginal and and we are going to
discuss reflect upon and this is part of an ongoing sort of ad hoc series this astonishing book by
james filler heidegger neoplatonism and the history of being relation as ontological ground that is no
as many of you know i've been making the case for this and how it sits well with our best cognitive
science our emerging cutting-edge physics and um the non-dual interpretation of mystical uh experiences
so i'm gonna i'm gonna welcome douglas and then ask him to tell us a little bit more specifically
about himself and then we'll take it away so welcome douglas uh thank you john for your very kind
invitation so i'm douglas headley and i teach the philosophy of religion uh at the university of
cambridge and i my intellectual career started off i suppose with a book about samuel taylor coleridge
and it was really through coleridge that i discovered a certain platonic tradition that i think
was uh in my bones anyway as a as a um from quite an early stage and then my work on coleridge
uh led me on to a group of thinkers called the cambridge platonists so forgive me for this
shameless bit of no plug away uh self um aggrandizement um and and generally is my interest is in the uh the
great metaphysical tradition of the west the um uh so the philosophy of religion in a in a broader
dimension i would i suppose and shaped particularly by the platonic tradition and if i may again
advertise that's another recent yes yeah participation in the divine uh which is about
this in a way i think it's it's profoundly relevant to the excellent book that we will be
talking about today thank you douglas i hope to have douglas back on at a later date to talk about
that book he just held up uh because uh it is a a wonderful anthology and thank you for uh helping
to put that together douglas that's it's a really wonderful book so we're gonna we're gonna i'm gonna
refer to i'm not gonna refer to filler uh i know james he's a friend and so i'm gonna call him james
but i'm talking about james filler throughout um and so i i i will give what i take to be sort of an
overview of the core schematic of the arguments that are made and then i'll i'll ask douglas to
where he wants to chime in where he wants to challenge where he wants to elucidate so james
is making the following argument he's making first of all he makes a conceptual uh uh analytic argument
to the effect that substance ontology and let me quickly explain that because we have changed the
notion of substance in some ways from what james is talking about um so he means it in an aristotelian
sense a good way to get a sort of a a good approximation of something that gets very technical
in philosophy is think about how language is divided up into subjects and predicates nouns and verbs um
and the subs the sub the idea is that reality is kind of divided up in a similar fashion there
are the noun things those are the substances and they they have verbs right and so the structure
of language and the structure of logic is the fundamental structure of reality and then this
is the idea that reality is actually made up of substances that are in various relations to
things just like you have subjects in a sentence that are related via the predicate the verbs to other
things um and and then aristotle of course famously built a metaphysical vision on this and it gets
taken up into various streams within the middle uh medieval periods scholasticism it gets taken up
in the scientific age by descartes but he fundamentally changes it and he moves it more towards our
understanding of substance as sort of the foundational stuff of reality but let's think of it more as a
critique of the idea that the world is made up of self-standing things that bear relation uh to other
things um which is a very common sense way of looking at the world so james's argument goes to the
following he says the problem with this is if you think that re that reality is ultimately made up of
these substantial things you have a problem accounting for relations because if you make a so let's say there's
two things a is related to b okay if you make the relationship a property of a then you don't need
b for to have a relation and that makes no sense because you need both entities so if you say you know
a is taller than b and you don't need b a can just be taller on its own that makes no no sense and of
course my similar same exact argument the relation can't be a property of b so then where is the relation
then you have to have that it's some independent thing existing and then you've already undermined
your claim that the world is primarily made up of uh substantial things because now these relations have
to exist in their own right and then how can the relations exist in their own right what are they
how are they existing and so once you get to that point then then james makes an additional move he says
but we actually have to use the relations to understand any of the things because if anything
we want to say about a thing immediately puts it in relation so if the thing has any understandability
the more technical word for that is any intelligibility if we have any information about the thing
that it's immediately in relation we set up a relation it's you know uh whatever we want to say
about the thing even saying it's on its own is to differentiate it from everything else and put it
into relation so then james says you can't get relations out of things and things uh the relations
are necessary for us to have any information or intelligibility about things and then he's making use
of an implicit premise which is we judge the realness of things by how much information or
intelligibility we have of them and so he says look you can't get the relations from the things
and the things are only real to us from the relations so relationality the relations have to be
primary they have to be the what reality ultimately is now i've pushed james a little on this and he he
he doesn't uh he doesn't he doesn't he didn't challenge me um i said uh james isn't it the case
though that uh you've made a great great argument that you can't get i'm going to use a technical
term relata means the things that are in relation you can't get the relata from the relations but i
said i can make an exactly symmetrical argument exactly like the one you just made showing you
that you can't get relations uh you can't get the relata out of the relations exactly the same a
symmetrical argument and he said oh and i said this points towards a more primordial notion
um very much like a zen notion of shunyata that the relay the relata and the relations co-emerge out of
something more primordial what i call pure relationality and then i you know this lines
up with is convergent with the way you know the particle and the field co-emerge in science or matter
and energy co-emerge or the wave and the photon the wave and the particle of light co-emerge or space and
time co-emerge etc um and he said oh that's a very powerful argument and that argument to my mind
doesn't do anything uh to undermine his his other two arguments which i'll quickly go over
one is that the neoplatonic tradition especially as held by the cappadocian fathers and held into the
eastern orthodox version of christianity actually captures this notion with a purely relational
idea of the trinity as ultimate reality and where the relata are themselves inherently relational
beings because they are roles father son spirit and they they're begotten or proceed from each other
and and you can get the gist of this argument the argument is that the trinity is a participatory
symbol it's not just a sign it's something we can experience right uh is a participatory symbol of
relationality as the ultimate uh ground um and that's his second core argument and then the third
argument is and this is one that he's joined by a a growing host of uh uh scholars uh stephen gerrish
um uh uh alexandrov alexandrov um uh robert kappa bianco arguing that heidegger is basically a
neoplatonist although he doesn't admit it uh and this is largely because heidegger has a serious
misreading of plato and then he sort of villainizes plato and then that gets taken up by postmodernism
the one thing that holds postmodernism together is the hatred of plato um and so all of that is
seriously under uh under uh important revision james uh joins in on that chorus of uh argument saying
that the neoplatonic tradition which has been very important about bringing us back to a proper
orientation of being um especially the later heidegger um is uh can be properly understood
as something very if not if not a species of at least deeply convergent with neoplatonism
and then that allows us to propose strongly neoplatonism as both a response to modernity and post
modernity um and i try to summarize a lot uh with uh just so we have you have a context in the
background you can watch the video we'll make a link here where i discuss this with james but after
doing this and i propose this to james i i said there's a bunch of people i need to talk to i'm
going to talk to bishop maximus who's an eastern orthodox bishop he's reading the book and then i said
i have to talk to douglas uh douglas is one of the great scholars about um the neoplatonic tradition
and one of the strong advocates for its revival as a response to what i call the meaning crisis
and other uh issues at work um so douglas that's my initial setting the stage and now i'll allow you to
take center stage where you want to make comments challenges uh moves wonderful well um thank you
for your your beautiful and lucid uh account of james's book um could i uh just say from the outset that i
am in agreement with the you know what the the germans might call
the original the original insight of uh james's book but um i'm i have some questions about some of
the moves and some of the emphases so i just want to uh so preface my remarks with um lauding this
remarkable contribution to the literature and i think part of a you know a broader revival of interest in
this this neoplatonic tradition uh before i go into my uh queries about james's account i'd just like to
note that there's probably another perspective which is worth mentioning in relation to our common interest
in the imagination and that is that one of the differences and this is of course rather schematic
between plato and aristotle is that claim that plato and this was very important for the neoplatonists
claims that the good is beyond being epic in artistus yes of course there's an enormous amount of inks
built on what that what that means but one implication could be that rather than for aristotle where philosophy
is the categorical determination of the t of a particular item so what it is uh so this conceptual analysis of
the nature of the nature of reality for the platonist because the good in some mysterious sense transcends
being uh whatever he means by being then we are forced into this dialectical relationship and
sometimes perhaps paradoxical relationship between what he calls nogos and mythos so we need the language of
the imagination we need symbols we need um myths perhaps you know uh in order to give a full account of
the reality that we uh encounter so that and i think that's one reason why platonism has been so
important for the poets for the artists um it's there's a sense in which the platonic tradition is already
linked into a caution about the power of the purely conceptual to delineate the nature of reality so i
just want to throw that in as a um as a uh preliminary thought so um first of all i'll start from the the
end of your uh analysis so with the heidegger because i mean when i was a student the tendency was either
to uh imitate heidegger and to write in a rather baffling heideggerian mode that you know so you're
either in the club or you weren't you know so you so the heideggerians would uh sort of imitate the the
master or they would uh ignore heidegger altogether um and we'll and many of us will be familiar with
the attacks on heidegger uh linked to his uh you know rather unfortunate uh history in that very
difficult time of of german german politics i mean i think that's more confusing than the and more
ambiguous than the critics make out but that's i think one of the reason for uh a downplaying of
heidegger's significance now it seems to me clearly he's uh a momentous figure and one of the great
philosophers of traditions i think there's no doubt about that um and he's also interesting
in terms of the profound theological dimension to to heidegger i mean i think this is one thing
that a lot of students of philosophy for maybe cultural reasons fail to realize just how significant
theology is as a backdrop for understanding our intellectual inheritance and heidegger is a typical
instance of this there's a very fine scholar called kiesel who has written a book on the theological
roots of being in time where he explores in great detail uh figures like schleiermacher and
luther and augustine and how um these figures were very important for the uh the writing of of being in
time and i'd also mention the figure that uh is little known but i think was important for heidegger's
uh upbringing in as a student in freiborg and this was a figure called karl bryg and bryg um
actually wrote a book called from zion uh so about being right so that's a bit of a giveaway yeah and
bryg was a sort of neoplatonically influenced romantic um so i think there are if you look into
the the history of heidegger you can see why this theological uh element is is there it's complicated
but it's i think it's no surprise another figure by the way i think whose significance is shelling and
uh particularly the later shelling heidegger of course writes a commentary on shelling's book on
on freedom so that would be the um my first point about this this deep um theological backdrop to
heidegger however one should also realize that um strangely enough germany when heidegger was uh
studying uh was not really uh a center of neoplatonic studies yeah and in fact the curriculum was
dominated by a sort of romantic i mean in the worst sense romantic view of the history of philosophy
in which you have an organic view of the philosophical tradition of the west and particularly
antiquity whereby philosophy ancient philosophy in its infancy is that of the pre-socratics
it comes to its adulthood in plato and aristotle it then develops into a rather stolid middle-aged
and hellenistic philosophy stoicism and then collapses into decrepitude uh mysticism and emanation in in late
antiquity now that was basically the view of philosophy that heidegger was inheriting at a time when
there was a revival of neoplatonism in england with dean ing uh the gloomy dean of london
st paul's in london who said my right my name rhymes with sting um and emil breyer who who uh
wrote a pivotal book on platinus so in a way we shouldn't blame heidegger for the fact that he didn't
know very much about about neoplatonism uh that i think was part of the context in which he
emerged so even his book on augustine doesn't have very much to say about the influence of plotinus or
or porphyry on on augustine so but um the the influence of heidegger's uh you know i would say
lack of knowledge of of neoplatonism on his epigones uh has been extraordinary yes yes both of the sort of
left-wing heideggerians uh and indeed the sort of right-wing heideggerians i won't mention any names
here but there are some you know uh theologians who say yes of course we have to avoid ontotheology
as heidegger presents it but if you understand dennis the areopagite then you can see that he
wasn't uh committed to ontotheology and he escapes uh heidegger's critique so i i i i think that um
there's uh uh uh one of the the interesting aspect of james's book is that he takes heidegger
seriously as a philosopher uh he doesn't go into this rather schematic well heidegger's given us all
the answers uh and i think wants to uh read heidegger in a rather neoplatonic way malko louis so i i
think that's a uh you know a very uh interesting aspect of james's book thank you for that yeah um
yeah most of the the authors that i mentioned don't claim that heidegger is a neoplatonist they claim
that there is a convergence uh between what heidegger is doing especially the later heidegger
um and um uh certain neoplatonic themes um so
are you largely in agreement with his proposal though that that reading of heidegger well not you
know totally perhaps exegetically uh accurate because we're we're sort of foisting a responsibility
on heidegger that he couldn't meet as you just clearly nevertheless um and that's why i use the
word convergent there's a convergent reading uh of that that then says you know given the centrality of
certain heideggerian arguments like the ontotheological critique um and that there is um
um um there's a viable neoplatonic response to the ontotheological critique and i see james's
core argument as being exactly that which is no there's a way to respond to the ontotheological
critique that nevertheless is you know um found within the tradition or at least precursors within
their tradition and it is also a viable framework for a rich religious and spiritual life namely the
neoplatonic um how does how does that proposal land with you yes no no i think i think that that
sounds uh right to me and i think it's also tied up with heidegger's complicated relationship with
christianity yeah actually i mean father bernhard welter actually gave a requiem mass
for martin heidegger in the church of saint martin uh i mean that's that's uh that's interesting i
mean and i think you know of course we're not talking about some ascent of the soul to the one
in heidegger so and so he's not a sort of card-carrying neoplatonist i mean i think that's what we
mean but i think um what james does very plausibly is to um explore ways in which there's a genuine
affinity between heidegger's thought and this uh neoplatonic tradition that he inherited through a
certain christian transmission you know meister eckhart yes glass and height and yeah and to some
extent totally so i mean the very i think the idea that you know dasein is the receptacle of the
yeah and this is some of this is difficult to translate but you know that the heideggerian
notion of the the unkuven designs you know the the being as as uh emerging the um the idea in the
early you know being in time that the stimmung there's this beautiful idea that uh the the mood
uh which is pre-conceptual yes uh there's another term in german the befindlichkeit so it's the
way that you find yourself in the world i mean this beautiful critique of the cartesian subject uh but
that that stimmung or that mood is the way in which you grasp the ungraspable you know you become
attuned to reality i mean it's it's very powerful and and i think drawing um in a creative way on on a
certain um you know uh genuinely neoplatonic tradition i would i would say that's good douglas i appreciate
that let but i want to pick up on a point you just made i mean capo bianco and others have pointed
there and you know john caputo did his book the mystical element in heidegger's thought you know
because of the influence of eckhart and others um and of course there's a conversation with
probably dt suzuki the japanese uh person zen um and so there is a mystical dimension but there is an
antipathy um so maybe uh in addition to a hatred of plato one of the things that unites both modernity
and post-modernity is an antagonism towards any strong sense of transcendence and let me explain what
i mean by that we we of course have we have a we have a reduced notion a merely psychological notion
of transcendence as self-actualization kind of maslow even though at the end of his career maslow was
proposing self-transcendence as beyond self-realization many people don't realize that
so we have this notion which is largely a nietzschean notion of well we can actualize ourselves we can
overcome ourselves what i mean by strong transcendence is a sense of transcendence in which there are
epistemological and ontological important consequences that that transcendence discloses
truths to us about the world that otherwise can't be known so it's not just we get increased
self-knowledge aspects or dimensions of reality disclose themselves to us and then ontological
we have a sense of knowing not as merely representational but as you know as contact
epistemology as conformity as participation and so we get a strong we become in some ways different
um and i and i think strong transcendence is one of the central claims of the neoplatonic tradition
that this is not of course it's not excluding the psychological but the transcendent is
not just psychological it is right it is both it has epistemological and ontological significance
and what i what i want to put to you is modernity rejects strong transcendence because they have a
very flattening ontology and they they there's a largely a drift towards you know a nominalist idea
that there's no there's nothing out there but sort of individuals and that sort of thing
um and we can get into reductionism if we have to but the modernity doesn't like strong transcendence
hence why we we get this push towards you know merely psychological transcend uh transcendence transcendence
and of course uh post post-modernism hates the word transcendence um and the idea of it being anything
beyond the nietzschean prospect is very troublesome to them because you know it seems to invoke a metanarrative or
a reality beyond the propositional text and all these kinds of things um now you said that neoplatonism
really emphasizes the ascent to the one which i think is a way of uh and i'm going to use your term
imaginally or mythologically talking about strong transcendence and and that i would put it to you that
you're right about this about heidegger that i think there's an antipathy towards this i mean he
talks about ecstasis but if you'll allow me a metaphor it's it's vertical i mean it's horizontal
it's ecstasis to the world but there's no ecstasis this way there's no verticality and the verticality
i mean rosen made this argument a long time ago in his critique of heidegger the verticality is missing
and that seems to me to be one way in which he strongly is not a neoplatonist i'm sorry that was a
rather long argument but how does that land for you yeah i think that's um i i think that fits in i
think with the the view that he was a sort of mystical atheist yes yes yes yes uh and i think there's
certainly but another way of looking at let me put another view to please yeah yeah we can debate so
um on the one hand there's this sort of rather i would say clunky narrative of the the ontotheological
constitution of metaphysics where you've got the influence of nietzsche's you know is yeah yeah
regularly strong and then the view of you know metaphysics is this you know decadent forgetting
uh and so um now um that of course is is is so crude i mean so for one thing um the idea that
metaphysics is uh ignorant of the the the difference between zion and zion yeah yeah yeah being and being
so well i mean as you know uh plotinus says quite explicitly that the one is pro two t it's before
any categorical uh determination you know yeah so there's the difference is is you know quite
explicitly and also i know that you're particularly fascinated by the relationship of you know actuality
and potentiality how we think of those two together well the one for platinus is the dunamis pantone
it's the the the potential of all the the the the mightiness of all the the capacity of all you
know i mean so far from platinus representing some uh sterile static substance metaphysics uh as as jim's
as james says you know this is this very dynamic yeah yeah conception that heidegger himself is is
basically oblivious to or simply replaces with this rather schematic um nietzschean caricature but in a
way heidegger is a correction of his own thesis because he shows himself how tempting the neoplatonic
tradition is because even though he doesn't quite come out with something like the full neoplatonic
story he's nudging towards it um so i i would say that um even more so in the later heidegger you have
aspects that come very close to the neoplatonic you know metaphysical uh uh drive yeah alexandrov's uh
really excellent book i recommend it uh the other platonist beginning uh he does this very tight and
deep exegetical uh uh uh hermeneutics on the late heidegger and then weaves it into exactly what you
said and then goes into plotinus and proclus and shows these themes it's it's it's also an excellent book
i mean schopenhauer has this great quip about you know count he says he says you know counts like a
man at a mass ball and you take the mask off the off the lady that he's been dancing with and you really
you find it's theology that i think you could say the same about heidegger that you know uh in a way
like count you think you've got this this secular philosopher who's who's uh uh operating with this severe
critique of the inherited theological tradition of the metaphysical tradition but when you dig away
you find that uh it's this this metaphysical theological tradition is is animating so much of
what he's doing i i i really appreciate that and i know that that's a a a prominent and well
articulated and developed theme in a lot of your work um and i've been talking about and we'll not go
down this this rabbit hole i've been talking about how theology is going to be the discipline
of the future with the advent of uh agi and things like that because the the the the pre-conceptual to
the post-conceptual dimension of our being and how it relates to ultimacy is going to become more
and more pronounced as what distinguishes us from these sort of techno-economical intelligences
and so i think theology i've been literally publicly saying that but that brings me to the
james's sort of second argument which i want to know yeah get moved to which is so he makes this proposal
um and you know my my eastern orthodox friends are jonathan pageau and bishop maximus of course to love
this but he makes this proposal um that um and i think this is at least partly in in agreement with
you just said is that this never went away this way we're talking about uh you know relationality and
and strong transcendence and a proper place for mystical experiences of non-duality etc that never went
away because we had this other tradition at least in european civilization of uh uh and i know you'll
be able to say the west has this too so i i i i'm not i'm not i'm not denying that but i'm just i'm
just saying what james's argument is that eastern orthodox christianity especially through the
cappadocian fathers right really like grasps this holds on to this keep and bishops maximus said he thinks
that you know eastern orthodoxy is the place where you you get you know the best sort of living
version of neoplatonism so these are these are theses on the table for us to discuss and and and
and the idea that particularly that you have a non-onto theological understanding of the trinity
running through that tradition thoroughly uh that you know and eckhart of course talks about it uh you
know the no thingness of god and and things like this um and this is you know this is you know
pronounced but this idea that the trinity properly understood is is not the pronouncement of right um
a substance thing as the most appropriate model of god uh but as a uh as a representation of ultimate
reality um and i i'll you i'll say symbol meaning a participatory symbol of the fact that ultimate
reality is this kind of pure relationality that lies below the relata and the relation and i think
there's something uh right about that but and i said this to james and i want to i want to hear what
you said but i had a bit of a pushback um first of all to compliment james that was the first time
in my tortured relationship with christianity where the the the trinity resonated with me and it wasn't
just sort of some third thing that i was forced to assert to um that just made no sense it was like
oh i get what this is pointing to now or could point to but i said but there's the notion of person
and i said you know i granted the greek you know hypostasis is different i'm already giving you that
latitude but i said you know prototypically aristotle's examples of substances are persons uh that's a
prototypical example um and and and is it not the case that understanding the trinity in terms of person
binds you back into a substance metaphysics and then undermines the argument you're making and i want
to hear what you think about that because i know you've already got a lot of you've got a lot of wiggle
room but you understand the challenge that i'm posing if you're invoking person and person is a
prototypical example by aristotle of what a substance is right the bear a subject that's never a predicate
and of course we build morality around that idea of personhood they are subjects that should never be
reduced to being predicates um and you can't categorical imperative is just a version of that i would
argue um so you know people are are always ends never means only etc um what do you say to that it's like
are isn't there a problem with understanding the trinity as persons that undermines the claim
of it as pointing to pure relationality as ultimate ground so did is that did you understand the challenge
i'm posing yes yes i suppose that um the uh the thought is that um if if this aristotelian notion of the
person as the bearer of certain properties uh that's then that seems to fit right into the the model that
james is rejecting exactly exactly exactly but i mean even in aristotle i say we might um disagree
about this and again it comes to my one of my sort of queries about the about the project and uh
here i'm sure i'd have jonathan pageau and others on my on my back but um i mean i i as you know i'm a
great fan of the cambridge platonists and in many ways they were they were greek thinkers so then so
they were attuned to the to the greek legacy and i think you might find some of their reasons uh
appealing because they were reacting to a uh rather dogmatic calvinistic theology particularly one of double
predestination and they felt this was sub-christian um and they felt that this dogmatic
predestinarian heavily augustinian theology was uh ultimately incompatible with the spiritual life
um and with what they regarded as the necessary fusion philosophy and and theology and of course
they were criticized at the time for being latitudinarians the men of latitude or wide birth
i.e they were being far too liberal in their theology and and were attacked vigorously um by both the
high churchmen and the uh the the reform tradition but um so i'm very attracted to the to the greek
tradition but first of all um there is a i don't think i'm being unfair if i say that there is a very
strong anti-intellectualist uh dimension to the the greek and russian orthodox uh tradition very often
you have to tell uh uh orthodox students that neoplatonism has played such a strong role in their
own tradition and i've had the experience of both orthodox students and muslims come to me and say
thank you for showing me that neoplatonism is part of a tradition that uh i'd sort of intuitively
accepted but wasn't aware that it was uh really uh part of the intellectual structure of my own
inherited theology so there's a strange sense in which there is a somewhat moribund aspect to to
eastern orthodoxy that contrasts unfavorably i would say with a lot of the dynamism in in western
theology i would say i i'm sure a lot of people will be unhappy with my my saying that but i i think
that's uh that's significant so even though i was uh very impressed by that section of james's book
where he's talking about the cappadocian fathers it's interesting that he should exclude saint augustine
uh now uh books nine and ten of de trinitate i think that constitutes one of the most important
parts of uh western philosophy and there's an interesting article by a eminent german philosopher
called kurt flash and it's called the rehabilitierung der relation or the rehabilitation of relation
and he sees that as based in augustine's de trinitate and then in john scott erigena so the article is
mainly about john scott and of course then scott is important for um for james's book um of course john
scott uh wonderful character living in the court of charles the bald um uh the great irishman who's brought
over to to translate uh dennis the areopagite into into latin and he is a thinker who is deeply
influenced by by the greek fathers and and dennis and maximus but also by by augustine so i think if
if i don't i think it's a bit unfair to artificially uh exclude this relational metaphysics from the western
tradition um as much as i you know i'm a great admirer of the the eastern christian church and
i've become increasingly fascinated by it in the last in the last few years the other thing is um i just
want to raise this in terms of the idealistic tradition which i i as you as you know i'm i'm
interested in i've been influenced by this in in my studies in germany and in fact i'd say one of the
characteristic differences between the german reception of neoplatonism and the french for
example is that the germans are much more deeply influenced in their interpretation of neoplatonism
by hegel and schelling and the the idealistic tradition now that's interesting because it means
there's a greater emphasis on the intellect in plotinus than the one i mean one of the key
issues in the interpretation of neoplatonism is um how do we understand the relationship between
the one and the intellect and in a sense christian theology trinitarian theology
we telescope the one and the one and the intellect so that the absolute principle
becomes a relational principle uh and you could now there's see that in terms of a interesting uh
influence of marius victorinus uh via porphyry uh and his influence on saint augustine but
there's i think uh as james is suggesting a distinctively uh christian influence upon the
neoplatonic tradition um but to leave out that other strand i say from porphyry to various victorinus and
and augustine seems to me just in terms of the history of philosophy to to be short-circuiting something and of
course via that tradition we have a legacy uh into figures like hegel now uh the fact that uh hegel
should be just as adamantly rejecting a sort of substance accidents metaphysics uh as any of the greek
fathers is uh is uh significant yeah now uh i take the point of james's argument that uh heidegger is
putting a stress on relation that uh is intriguingly novel uh i think one could see it as a radicalization of
husserl uh so i think yeah that's fair um but in a way there's a sense in which uh he's part of a
saying of a broader strand and this is something i learned from reading james's books i never really
even though i was conscious of these uh sort of covertly neoplatonic elements in heidegger i hadn't
thought of it in terms of the centrality of relation um but now i can see through james's book this link
between a centrality of the of the this this notion of relation that is not the dominant strand in western
metaphysics but i would say emerges um uh from time to time and of course it's no accident that hegel
should think that the doctrine of the trinity is absolutely key to his own metaphysical system i mean
it's linked to the fact that he's not proposing a substance ontological uh system but one in which
uh you have a uh geist ontological or a spirit ontological uh that of course what's decisive
for geist well it's the by si selber sein im anderen as he says it's the being yourself in the other so
that's why uh he thinks that the the trinity is this uh central uh
forstellung or imaginary or or in your language symbol
yeah uh because it is capturing a truth about reality that the traditional substance metaphysics
cannot capture so this these would be just a few remarks about the the kind of history of philosophy
in in the book um that that's good i mean and i think your point comes out well uh in the fact
and i'm not totally on on board with james's critique of uh whitehead because whitehead is is in some
ways hegel plus a recapturing of platonism yep and process philosophy trying to put it in deep dialogue
with the scientific world view um and i i'm not i'm not so sure uh that you know i i get james's
critique that you know whitehead seems to still privilege actuality over potentiality and that's
losing some of what the neoplatonists were on about as you said being is more you know the deepest
possible potentiality but it's also a power um uh so i i take that point well but before we turn to
that i i i just want to make sure we close off this this previous point so i grant you everything i
and and i would put whitehead like i said in that that line you're pointing to in the west no there's
been this and whitehead is clearly birthed out of that whole tradition he's he reads it quite deeply
he references it uh so i think and the fact that that shows up in james's book and and it's i think
there should be more of a critical engagement with whitehead there that's one of my criticisms of the
book um but putting that aside i'm not putting it aside acknowledging that and then going further i
want to go back now now i'm asking you to now step out and answer uh as as a a a as a profound teacher
about the imaginal uh the imagination which you've invoked a couple times here as and it's not a
faculty you make that very clear but as the our cognitive capacity uh for coming into strong
transcendence uh realization of the one uh etc i still didn't hear what you think about
uh how standard christianity has tended to understand the trinity in terms of persons
and the model of the persons are like entities like us um and um and that of course is interesting
and there's a whole tradition of us being the image of god that's at work there
um and like i said this seems to me to be antagonistic to the proposal of relationality
unless you move to a non-aristotelian understanding of the person as uh which you're already getting
in dasein and you're already getting in hegel and you're getting in 40 cocci that the the person is
inherently dialogical yes right yes not not monological not mono sub not substantial but
inherently dialogical horizontally and vertically and so you understand a person that way and and so
i'm asking do you see that move as the way of like of responding to mike you say no no we don't have
to abandon the person language we can go back and go back to hypostasis and then what we're doing is
giving up the the thing model of person and the monological model and moving to a dialogical do
you that's what i was right in fact rejecting the the atomistic yes of the person yes yes exactly exactly
i mean the great the great goethe says um that of us to this become what you are yeah yeah that paradox
of course which is um such a profound paradox of the spiritual life uh doesn't make sense
on this atomistic exactly the person yeah it doesn't account i mean if when you think that
way you hit it you hit galen strassen's paradox of self-transcendence right if it's if it's just the
self-growing there's no transcendence and if it's other than the self then it's transcendence but not
self-transcendence and you yeah because she's you're bound into this particular model of the the
self as a thing um yeah that's one reason why um later this year i'm i'm looking forward to talking
to you about theosis and yeah and this you know mysterious and uh rather puzzling notion that's so
central in the eastern church and i say something that uh we don't uh think of in quite the same way or
with the same centrality in the west but that's a really baffling and yet core idea of the self um
with intriguing parallels with asian thought i mean deeply i think yeah that thou art yeah yeah how do
how do you understand how do you understand um that well uh the question of of the person is
well one of the the the great metaphysical uh
mysteries um but it's but it's it so it's not a you know to use marcel's uh distinction between a
problem and a mystery uh yeah it's it's i think it's not one of those issues that we can we can solve
with the um the analytic intellect but it's not um simply some dogmatic uh stipulation i think
the the idea of the person is is um a profound idea that uh accompanies the great metaphysical
tradition and of course the the great spiritual traditions of the of the west yeah and you're
right it makes deep connections to vedanta i'm studying vedanta quite deeply right now sarah
uh you will get to meet uh uh you know she just got her certification as a yoga teacher and a proper
yoga not just exercise but the pranayama the meditation the advita vedanta right philosophy
the whole package and so we're actually reading the upanishads together and we're talking about this
wonderful wonderful yeah i i i'm lucky to have such a partner uh i i appreciate that move i think
i mean not to get into this because we will be talking about it later but i do think a dialogical
model of the self with strong transcendence makes theosis more understandable i think if you're in
a monological uh and all you have is a psychological a monological model of the self and all you have is
a psychological notion of self-transcendence theosis cannot make sense to you so it's completely
unintelligible yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so and i like you invoking uh uh marcel uh i think love is
actually a commitment to the mystery of something in a profound way um yes um so i i take that i take
that uh very well and i think indeed that that um i mean we've spoken about this before but the
the question of love uh in western thought uh that is uh profound and and beautiful contribution of
i know you're going to object to this john but uh i say of of of the christian inheritance i don't object
to it i i think no i i don't object to that i i this is what i mean when i say i prefer christian
neoplatonism over pagan neoplatonism not because there is not a lot to be learned uh from uh from
platinus and proclis and iamblichus uh there is and you know and our mutual colleague uh gregory shah
has done a lot revived that for us and there's a whole ritual way of life associated with it but i
think the development of eros especially in dionysius um and taken up in maximus dionysius is aware of
the distinction we sort of retrospectively impose on people between what we call eros and what he
calls agape but he prefers the term eros because eros is the wanting to be one um and he has this
wonderful thing about the relationship between eros and agape and you don't get that deep profound
reflection um in uh pagan neoplatonism and and i think it's odd that heidegger who has care
at the centrality of dasein of human being doesn't get into deep discussion about love
uh because again and this is a neoplatonic argument i think love requires strong transcendence and right
not just horizontal but right that's the symposium that's the main argument of the symposium
right and without that uh you can't talk profoundly uh about love so i think that's why there's this
telling absence in heidegger you know the grandfather of existentialism of this and love isn't an emotion
or a feeling it's a profound existential mode and so how is this profound existential mode largely missing
well i think that's again i think the the absence of a deep discourse uh about love is part of the the
hostility towards strong transcendence as a real possibility yes i wonder whether also
nature it's the the the the legacy of this sort of aristocratic contempt for the uh christian
inheritance that is an inheritance that is stressing humility and compassion and love and the emphasis
upon um and schlossenheit and entscheiden i mean all this language this tough language which um you
can put into context of the you know the horrors of the early 20th century but um yeah i wonder
whether there's part of this sort of aristocratic tradition of machiavellian nature which uh stresses
pagan virtue um manly fortitude rather than this uh christian compassion and love yeah i think that's
a good argument as well douglas i think that's a very good point i think the nietzschean uh rejection of
love uh especially as his pejorative sense of the feminine uh exactly and i think that's all part
of nietzsche's very profound and complicated relationship with both schopenhauer and and wagner
yeah yeah so again that brings us into the the eastern tradition where uh you know nietzsche wants to
go back to the pre-socratics what he sees as this more primordial greek affirmation of life and
rather than the the resignation that he associates with uh schopenhauer and tinge in religion and
christianity well said well said uh that's interesting again the absence of the reflection
of the hard work that it was already done within neoplatonism back in plotinus of separating itself
distinctly and cleanly from a kind of gnostic attitude i think would have also uh helped uh maybe
attenuate that nietzschean influence on heidegger to some degree that that's interesting because i
mean we we are we're we're in this we're we're double bind about the body and embodiment right now
we in one sense we it's almost it's almost a fetish and an idol in our bodies and our bodies and our
bodies and then on the other hand there's this there's this gnostic desire to liberate ourselves from
the confines of the body and you know transhumanism my avatar there's this weird weird um and and i
think that's also partly because we've lost touch with the christian neoplatonic tradition that really
tries to wrestle with um a profound sense of um embodiment um uh copper bianco and um
he talks about this the the crucifix that was beloved by saint francis
and he makes a proposal for it of uh uh as one of the best icons of finite transcendence
um that finitude and transcendence are completely held together in this icon i don't know if he's
aware of hyland's argument that this is the core thing that plato keeps trying to get us to
don't lose your finitude or you'll become hubristic and tyrannical don't lead you you don't lose your
transcendence or you will become servile and despairing right uh you have to hold the two
together and of course this is the metaxu that william devins william desmond is making so much uh
makes makes so much with and and i and that was another moment with me where i was looking at it and i and
and i got oh wow right christianity did something really powerful about right about the the inhabitation
of finite transcendence um and and are something that is both humanizes us and also vectors us
towards something greater than us i thought that was just a profound uh thing and so i think nietzsche
again and and heidegger i think heidegger's wrestling with finite transcendence um and trying
to understand how to hold them together i mean there's the thrownness and the finitude but there's
also you know there's being and but he doesn't it's hard to what am i trying to say it's hard to get
that into something that is can be enacted by the imagination that can be imaginal for us and i
saw that that that christian icon uh of of the crucifix was very powerful i actually purchased a version
of it um and it was very interesting uh to see that in place so um i think that the rejection uh i think
that we are we have this two-way double bind disastrous vacillation around the body because we can't properly
get um something analogous to embodiment in the incarnation the crucifixion all how all those
are bound up together as this rich ecology of symbols for helping us properly like identify
inhabit our humanity sorry that was a long argument but i just wanted to no no and i think it's no
accident that the later heidegger is fascinated by poetry yes yes yes yes you know and and then this
contrast between denken dichten or thought and you know that the i mean those strange utterances like
die Wissenschaft denkt nicht you know that science doesn't think yes yes yeah of course it's you could
take that as a sort of philistine rejection of of of science which of course it isn't it it's but it's a
thought about the significance of poetry i think which is at the same time so profoundly bodily yes it's linked
to our music to dance um rhythm uh and at the same time poetry is archaic it touches uh the roots of
our humanity but it's also of course the most precious articulation of transcendence yeah yeah yeah
yeah that's that's an excellent point that's an excellent point um and i i do see christian
neoplatonism with the liturgy as enacted poet poesis enacted poetry as also offering i i mean i get i get
gregory i get greg's argument about theurgies also doing something like that but right uh christianity
seems to have developed it uh very thoroughly douglas we're running out of time and i wanted to give
you the opportunity for any last words you'd like to uh to give us uh before we we wrap things up but
before i pass it to you uh this was thoroughly uh enjoyable i just i had a wonderful time i hope you
did too no i did yes and i hope i hope we do this again i do want to have you back and talk about
your anthology uh participation in the divine um and so yeah yeah well um i'm very grateful for this
opportunity to uh talk about this book and i think it's a sign of a good book that it it makes you rethink
mm-hmm yeah yeah your own position and i certainly found um this work uh you know a profound stimulus
and so even though i i don't agree with everything that uh james philip is saying um i think this is a
genuinely transformative work and i think is part of a groundswell of interest in that rich metaphysical
and theological tradition that we need so urgently what a beautiful and almost precise way to end it
thank you so much my good friend and i look forward to seeing you in person soon in multiple locations
and having you on again to talk about your anthology thank you so much douglas thank you john
