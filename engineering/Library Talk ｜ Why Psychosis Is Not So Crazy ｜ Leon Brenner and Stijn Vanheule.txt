so let's kick it off here's the book uh staying new book why psychosis is not so crazy the second
title is a road map to hope and recovery for families and caregivers and i finished it just
a few days ago and had a very good time reading it and i'm very excited to talk to you staying
about it today so thanks for joining us yeah it's my pleasure and thanks a lot for the invitation of
course yeah so so i'll begin by saying um that well it's clear that your contribution to clinical
psychology particularly psychoanalysis and particularly the lacanian perspectives are
renowned worldwide and i think people already know some of your writings those that are joining
us here um and i think that your writing is always very clear very concise to me it reminds something
of the freudian scientific rigor but this book stands out um i think in in your effort to connect
with a broader audience um and well it seems to me at least after reading the book that you've done
a remarkable job translating uh complex insights uh that clearly come from the lacanian orientation
into a language that is accessible to people who are not familiar with psychoanalysis with lacan
and i really find that truly commendable so i wanted to start by asking about the intended
readership of the book um the title also already suggests families uh caregivers uh but i'd like you
to if you could elaborate in your own words who uh in our audience uh you believe would benefit most
from reading the book yeah so maybe i can tell you um of course by practicing and because of the fact
that i teach um at university i in the in recent years i've been talking to really different kinds of
audiences um and for example in clinical work when working with like maybe someone who has been
struggling with the psychotic episode or maybe working with a parent or a partner who has a relative
who has had psychotic episodes or struggling with acute psychosis um i have to say something um i have to
speak um because in in in the treatment of psychosis it's not just a matter of like um like just remaining
silent and and having a poker face and um and and not giving answers to specific to specific questions so
in my practice i i had to give answers to people about questions they were having and the same is
true um like when i teach to clinical psychology students um most of them don't have a specific
interest in psychoanalysis the moment they start their psychology studies um but um i think it's my duty
to to talk with them in in a language that is not frightening them um but rather triggering some
interest um and and talking about clinical problems like psychosis for example i think helps people to
to um to join um a psychotic way of thinking and and and speaking so it was by doing all this
um that i kind of came to the conclusion like why why wouldn't i write something for these for this
broad audience of of many different kinds of people who have an interest in psychosis
um and then more more specifically it was also triggered by the fact that um there was one person
um branda fruion who was a flamish activist with psychosis vulnerability and she at one point when
i was having a discussion discussion with her she mentioned me like okay when i had my first psychotic
breakdown and i went to the library to read and to find books on psychosis these were so depressing
it were either like very biological books um that were giving advice like you will have to take
medications the rest of your life and like a very deterministic uh line of reasoning or work that were
very incomprehensible and for example she had tried to read the alien leaders um what is madness and she
said like after 50 pages i had to stop because it's about case studies and things like that and that's not
really my background i'm not a clinician and so um that comment also by her was for me like okay but
what if someone who has a psychotic episode or a relative or maybe a nurse or a social worker who
is working in the clinic is asking a question about psychosis what exactly is it that maybe me as a
clinician and maybe me as a psychoanalyst can start answering that question and it's a different kind
of answer that i give compared to for example a biologically trained psychiatrist and i thought that
this psychoanalytic lacanian voice needed to be articulated in a clear way um and and that's how
i decided to to make this book and when you made it um did you have a particular audience in mind um was it
um mostly for those uh experiencing psychosis those they know it it was like for for the different kinds
of people that have been mentioning like for patients for for their relatives but also for mental health
care workers um who have hands-on questions uh when working with psychosis and maybe also because
for for for more for people who have an intellectual interest in in in in in the status of for psychosis
and society um so i wanted to go like very broad and and and this was new for me because i tend to
write for or for other academics or for other psychoanalysts and that was my safe zone this this other
way of writing so for me it was like um like something exciting and dangerous and very new
to to try to do this um but i had this very broad audience in mind i think you you did a very good job
and i've already talked to some people uh in the crowd today that had told me they've read the book and
found it uh very compelling um let's get to it let's get to to one of let's say a profound idea i think
that's important to explore uh and this is something that you mentioned already at the outset of the
book and this is the idea that psychosis is an inherent part of being human you say that it reveals
something fundamental about the human condition and here comes the lacanian twist particularly at the
very edge of our freedom yeah so i was wondering what does psychosis teach us about the human
experience if you can tell us a little bit and maybe also about the limit uh the limit we encounter
within it yeah yeah yeah um well that's a very broad question i could talk an hour about but i won't do
that but actually um it it's it comes from a discussion between lacan and hardy a who was like a
contemporary of a psychiatrist in in paris um who had more of an academic career they they were trained
together and at a certain point they have been discussing the question of psychosis and harry a
was like um a bit more at the side of like we have to be careful in giving diagnosis because it's limiting
people's freedom because maybe it's stigmatizing and and then lacan's point was no no no we have to give
the diagnosis of psychosis because it touches very specifically on the question of human freedom so
it's it's kind of a bit the paradoxical lacanian intervention in that field and um when when i take
that quote um it is in my view so interesting because it shows that um for lacan the human being is free to
the extent that we are not determined purely at the biological level which is already an idea from
freud of course like the distinction between the instinct and the drive and the drive is something
that puts us on the scene with a living body um that has impulses that has a certain jewry sense but
that jewry sense is not directed um in the sense that we don't know exactly how to deal with it and
at a certain point i refer to nietzsche who said like the human being is a sick animal um um well in a
certain sense we are all a bit have this same sickness in the sense that we are lacking something
very fundamental already biologically and this is this is a challenge but it opens um a domain of
freedom because it opens the possibility of choice if if i in my sexual behavior i'm not completely
determined by my hormones then that means that there is an ethical thing at stake like i have to take a
decision and when i have to take a decision there is some possibility of freedom it's not that everything
is possible but there is some freedom and that freedom is ethical and then i would say like okay
this is a starting position then what is neurosis what neurosis is actually the choice for convention
the neurosis means that you adopt the the law of your culture the law of your family the law of your group
um and you take it as your frame of reference to kind of frame these existential challenges
these aspects of a non-existence i would say with the later lacan we we deal with these questions
of the non-existence by making use of the law of culture and we try to translate it into something
of an existence how to exist as a saturated being as a parent and that's the neurotic solution and in
neurosis of course we know it it results in division subjective division because there's there's doubt do
i make the right choice or not but what is then psychosis well psychosis is the inability to make
use of convention and simply because convention is not compelling convention is not appealing convention
is not speaking to someone so it's not of a help it's not that convention is not known but it might be
and that's the possibility of psychosis that it's just not saying something for you and if convention is
not there as as a source of inspiration you're there in on your own and that then you're at the point of
freedom and for me that's the exactly the point where lacan is situating madness madness means that
you don't have like the conventional way of of making up reality at your disposal which means that reality
tends to go crazy which also means that you will have to invent and so at that point you're very free but
it's very challenging as well it's anxiety provoking and that's a contrast with the typical neurotic
solution which is more conventional and which in a sense is is is stupid um because you don't think
you you don't use your possibility of freedom um at that level so stupidity uh and and being an idiot
is in lacan's later line of reasoning very typical of neurosis whilst like being more free but it comes
with the cost um of of of loneliness and of having to bear these very difficult questions yourself is
is typical of psychosis but let's uh maybe try and nuance this a bit um it is not i'm sure uh that you mean
that uh psychotic experience is utterly um detached from convention um i think we might say you know
someone can follow the law it is follow rules okay follow rules but then know nothing about the law
i was wondering you can maybe nuance this relationship to convention um uh when we think about uh psychosis
versus uh neurosis yeah well in indeed convention of course here i mean like the idea um of indeed the
loud like the trust that what is being said what is being articulated is true is like this is how it is
and i think that neurosis is an attempt to believe and to accept that there is something of a lawfulness
uh as if it was a law of nature in the things that that we take from culture like for example the way
we think about romantic relationships we we think of it for example in in neurosis people think of it in
terms of of of a law the law of love and they try to believe in it although they know that it's not
exactly a law but they try to behave as if it is a law and it's this way of acting that in in psychosis
i think that lacan is pointing to that very specific point that in psychosis is not operating
the same way so it's it's it's what freud called the the ungloben so it's it's it's almost an
impossibility to to believe that it is true because it's already seen as okay this is just one way of
thinking about it but it's not acting as a support from for me and of course that does not mean
that the stories are not known and that the contents and the and and and and the figures that
are all there in our cultural narratives um that they would not be there but they and and this is
typically what happens during psychotic experiences these elements all return but in in in a bit of a
a different way like in a delusion for example take schreber god is also there in in his delusion and
where does god come from well from our cultural narrative but schreber's god is a different kind
of god and why is it is he different than lacan's line of reasoning it's because he's not behaving
according to the law of how a god behaves and therefore schreber experiences for example as an abusing figure
um and i think there is there is something of of of of of that so um in that that is so typical of psychosis
well let's try and give it another twist of the screw but i'll i'll ask you in advance and because
i'll ask about symbolic imaginary to tell us also a little bit about this for people who don't know
uh because um you rely on lacan and it's very clear i think in the book that a linguistic theory
uh stands behind um these developments in psychoanalytic technique and metapsychology
and you explain i think quite very clearly in the book how in psychosis a a gap in the symbolic
creates a gap in the imaginary so there's a certain disruption in language that disrupts the continuity
of mental life so if you could tell us a little bit about your connection between psychosis and language
and how how do you view this relationship as shape shaping our understanding of psychosis yeah yeah so
maybe let's start with these three registers the real the imaginary and the symbolic um the real well
what i um earlier discussed about the the questions of existence or the dilemmas of existence that are
connected to the drive register um like our sexuality but also like being a parent being alive having a body
um in lacan's line of reasoning it's precisely because there is it's just a biological impulse
but without an inherent knowledge it is real and why is it real because we don't know how to deal with it
um it's perplexing in a certain sense that that's the real and then the idea is that the human being
uses the imaginary and the symbolic to kind of treat the real to try to
do something with it and then the imaginary refers to the the register of images
meaning like mental representations that we built about reality and often we then we when we think
about our consciousness consciousness means that we have like a cinematographic representation in our
minds where we could for example think about breakfast this morning and immediately see what we
have be have been eating and we maybe we see a little movie-like thing we like putting the food in our
mouth uh well that is the imaginary like this kind of filmic construction that we have in consciousness
uh so that that's one that's the second register and then the register of the symbolic is the register of
of language use and here we could say that the human being treats the real with words or as lacan would
say with signifiers and these signifies function in like web-like structures and my idea is that
um we cover up reality with such a web-like structure of signifiers and these signifiers these of course provoke
meanings and ideas and that's how there is an interaction between the symbolic and the imaginary
but generally speaking the symbolic and the imaginary are our ways of dealing with the real and that's in
lacan's theory like the universal idea any human subject is functioning that way and here what is
then typical of psychosis then the idea is that there is something of a whole of of something that is
missing that is not functioning at the level of the symbolic so there is an impossibility to kind of
create something of a narrative around certain dilemmas in life that you've been confronted with
um and and and that's that that results in a very specific way of experiencing because if we
traditionally link the symbolic to the imaginary and we kind of create representations and not just
cinematographic images but like little scenarios about life um then in a freudian perspective we are
doing secondary process thinking and what is secondary process thinking in freud's line of reasoning
well that's exactly trying creating logically coherent ideas about the world
but what happens then if this is failing like like like is the case in psychosis
well when we can switch to freud freud would say like at that point you will see primary process
um thinking or this primary process thinking well that's the very associative way of dealing with
the elements of mental life where it's no longer no no no longer about the the logical coherence and
the comprehensibility uh in terms of what i can share with someone else but like a very associative way
of connecting elements that have formal similarities like similar sounds or similar colors or similar letters or
numbers that that that return and freud's idea was like this is dominant both in dreams and in psychosis
and with lacan i would say like well it is this way of spontaneous associative thinking
that will come to the fore at the moment of a psychotic breakthrough um and this is kind of my general
like conceptual tool in the book to situate as you could see like many different kinds of psychotic
experiences as as operating at these levels of of um well of making sense of reality or having
having a difficulty or something not at your disposal in in making sense of of reality
yes i think both the theme of the primary and secondary processes
as well as the metaphor of the film is a thread that repeats in the chapters of the book and it's
very helpful to to ground the different notions and ideas that you present even when you engage with
more complex concepts like imaginary symbolic and real um i'd like to maybe focus on one thing that you
mentioned this whole uh and in this sense uh there it it reminds me of course of some notion in the
lacanian framework uh that speaks of a distinction between um a a structure of psychosis let's say is
some structure that bears a whole that whole a whole is a a hallmark maybe of of this type of of
of this type of of structuring and then on the other side a manifest psychosis or in a psychosis psychotic
crisis um so i think it's quite an important distinction i i wonder if you can clarify the
difference between the these and explain how they relate to each other yeah yeah um well in the book i
make this distinction between um discrete psychotic experiences and manifest psychotic experiences to
to differentiate between both um and discrete psychotic experiences are like the things that people can
um feel or start to experience in in in in in their being in reality where something of of me using
language um to master reality and me creating images to to to construct reality when something strange is
happening to that process where something of an automatism for example comes in um and this is for
me typical in in in line with what lacan also says of course like um of discrete psychotic experiences
and it's discrete because here we don't have hallucinations here we don't have delusions but reality
itself starts to behave in a strange way and it can be the outside reality but it can also the inside
reality and here in the book i describe like how some people's bodies act to start to act in strange
ways in the sense that that suddenly things can happen in that are felt physically in the body that
people are perplexed by or it could be at a mental level where for example words start jumping around or
you've suddenly you start having ideas uh imposed thoughts of which you don't have the feeling that
you have been thinking them but nonetheless they are in your mind um or it could be like behavioral impulses
like some people be a witness to the fact how they tend to be aggressive but they don't want to be
aggressive but they can have an aggressive tendency in themselves for which they are afraid and so these
are my line of reasoning are like the discrete psychotic phenomena um which indeed we can see as um
as as as just the encounter of how the symbolic and the imaginary don't kind of function in the
confrontation with something of the real but at that point you won't see like this triggering of the
the primary process associative thing and this is exactly what will happen in manifest psychotic
experiences when we have delusions and when we have hallucinations and typical there is that it will
always start from a revelation um and what is a revelation it's really the experience of a concrete
thing that is being manifested to me from outside like a voice for example in the context of of a
hallucination or in the context of a delusion a sign uh like something that happened something that
says something to me a revelation of of of of of an element that i kind of give an interpretation to
of course in like a very specific way but then it's when something of an action coming from outside
is experienced that we can talk about um manifest psychotic experiences
and and these phenomena um commonly i think uh in in films in popular media books these phenomena
delusions hallucinations they often portrayed as something that is um a a a sign of illness a sign of
of of degeneration uh a a dead end but i think something that's very important that you stress
in your book is that actually these phenomena delusions hallucinations provide a way out of
nothingness and this is how you you write about it in the book so i i want you to maybe say a little
bit about this stabilizing function or this productive function uh that you identified delusions and
hallucinations yeah so it's precisely because when we see that um what is really like destabilizing is
the confrontation with the real uh if you're being confronted and as i described in the book it's
usually through specific moments incidents in life specific events in life these trigger us as a human
being being to kind of act and biology biology is not learning teaching us how to how to act so we need
ideas and if there is no idea to guide me i tend to disappear i tend to disappear into something of a
nothingness and um well in the discrete psychotic experiences um often confront people with this
nothingness where they tend to lose everything like their thoughts but also their self image
and there there is a threat of a certain kind of a disintegration and then the idea is that if
there is indeed like this primary process generated mental life again that this is already an attempt
to do something to treat that that that difficulty and that was a very early idea that jung and freud in
their early work on psychosis were were already articulating like it is something of of an attempt
to survive in in a world um so they are kind of these phenomena are treating the basic problem which
for me as a psychoanalyst also means like we don't have to remove these phenomena we have to think of
course like how to how can we help the treatment because it's something of a spontaneous treatment how
can we help the treatment and then two important things i guess are like on the one hand
trying to listen or helping to listen to what is being articulated
because often hallucinations and delusions they don't deal with random topics it's it's it's it's very
frequent that people have religious content so sexual contents or like things that have to do with
government and with the police um and with being alive or being death uh and so these are like
specifically the the existential topics that every human being is is struggling with but in in in an
eccentric way these topics occur in delusions and hallucinations and then my point is but it's not
random it is because you can also notice that the content is because they are working on a specific
topic so somebody who has like i'm again returning to schreber although i talk only a little bit about
schreber in the book but um schreber for example he's treating the question of authority and of being a
father for someone and his entire delusion is is is around that so it's not random it's because he's
being confronted with that problem um that was challenging for him and for which something of a more
lawful way of thinking a more common sense way of thinking was not operative so delusions learn and
hallucinations learn something about what people are struggling with so there is a story to be told
there is that something can be created so and i think that stimulating people to do something with it
to create to speak um and to to give shape to to what they have um been experiencing and to
that this is an important track to follow but on the other hand it's also helping people to limit the
experience because often it's overwhelming so helping people to limit it and to make it bearable to make it
human for for themselves and and not like devastating is is is another clinical challenge and i think it's
important to stress both and um therefore psychosis is both something a crisis psychotic crisis is
something that produces suffering but on the other hand it's also something that has the potentiality
of illuminating something of of of teaching something to a person about their lives um and i think
this is very important to take into account and and very different from how in our western context we
tend to kind of of of think of of of psychotic experiences as as the disease itself and the content
of a psychotic experience as nonsense and as dangerous to talk about because the more you
talk about the psychotic uh experiences the more you move away from reality this is often like a more cbt
like contexts the case that you have to stay with reality whilst i i think that psychoanalysis offer a
possibility to also listen to to the craziness so to speak of of of delusion because it's not just
crazy it's it's it's it's saying something and it's it's an invitation for the person who experiences it
to to do something to create something out of it yes you know i i think foucault who has never said
something good about freud or psychoanalysis said one thing good about it in his history of madness and
this is exactly that freud is open to listening to madness at the level of its language and i think it's
really distinguishes as you were saying the psychoanalytic approach to psychosis and the
psychiatric approach to psychosis also taking account that medication while useful on many cases it also
sort of reduces the uh the depth and the um the the the content that actually appears a content that
can be worked with but i want something i really wanted to talk to you staying because we just have
a few more more minutes i have two more things i want to ask you but the first maybe i can uh rip on
what you've said that you don't only speak about shreba in the book and that's very correct you mention a
lot of figures and especially figures uh from the world of art like rené magri james joyce uh kusama
sven unik id i hope i'm saying his name correctly and elene sacks among others and you suggest that
creative and inquiring minds like these um on the one hand are quite vulnerable to psychosis
but also you say that art plays a role in uh their experience of psychosis
and in this sense well it might even be used as a means to cope uh during a psychosis psychotic crisis
yeah if you could tell us a little bit about this country on art yeah yeah yeah but about about the
cases um when writing the book i decided to uh on behalf of schreber to go for all kind of all the others are
cases that are not commonly discussed within psychotic literature and lacanian literature in
particular so i wanted to go for new cases because otherwise we always talk about the same
and so i wanted to go for for new cases but indeed my key idea here is that that creation and creativity
is is is crucial and i think this maybe brings us back to your first question about the freedom because
so what is artistic creation what is artistic invention it's like it's like taking a little
distance for from convention like a painter like margaret for example or yayoi kusama
they kind of started like an own style they they don't copy they don't take convention
and and just reproduce no they they they they take it as a point of departure to go an own way uh and
here i think that it's it's a that artistic creation is a certain use of freedom that the non-artistic
person an individual in the world is is is is not so not so in touch with so therefore i think that
artists creation and and freedom are really connected and also particular is that um an artist's
a creation is framed he's typically for an artist is that they they work in a workshop uh meaning like
it's limited in time and space and that's why it is possible to create something because it's not
everywhere but it's it's it's it's in their local space that that they are working and here i i i see
a link with psychosis because when we have this problem of freedom and psychosis and this out of
the box thinking because there is the boxes is in a certain sense there there are holes in the box so
it's open box thinking is there um so here there is a also a possibility of of of creation and invention
and um i think within the lacanian approach we we tend to stress this as a possibility um because
the psychotic experience like a delusion and hallucination isn't already something of a creation
that's already an invention of something um and my idea is that this dimension of invention should be
stimulated and people should be encouraged to to to find a register for themselves that is sufficiently
in line with how they way of having primary process thinking um it should be enough in line with that
so if you are like a poetic mind it could be poetry or when you're seeing images and having
um imaginary associations it could go in the direction of painting so i think there is a possibility
and they can learn also something from the artist in the sense that um like trying to limit it in time
and space the moment you start working with it creatively with this way of of using your thoughts
and imagination that's the challenge i i i think for people in in psychosis like limiting it on on the
one hand but on the other hand like trusting it and and and doing something with it um as well
and this brings us to a very important figure that appears in your book
and i think it's one of my favorite chapters on the book it's a chapter about carl jung and you refer
to jung um maybe not maybe he is but not in the terms of a a sublime analyst but as a sublime psychotic
and you describe how his work are it actually did this remarkable balancing act it's it's exemplary
you say to the way an individual experiencing psychotic crisis can find a way to treat themselves
you also connected to a very interesting concept from jacqueline miller the concept of bricolage
so if you could and i think we'll end our discussion we'll open it to questions after if you could just
say a few words about about jung and bricolage and we'll wrap it up there yeah yeah so um i'm not the
jung specialist but um at a certain point i discovered his red book and the red book by
jung is like a very big manuscript um in which jung had been painting but also using um calligraphic
writing and the calligraphic writing that is there is something that was spontaneously revealed to him
um and um then i started to like researching the history of that book and and and of course it all
began with him breaking up with freud um when both guys broke up jung started to have um what i would
call psychotic experiences um like um lucid dreams but also hearing voices in the night that were whispering
things to him um and jung had the very good or in creative the idea to note these things down and
to keep like little diaries to write these things down and to start drawing and painting um and and and
writing the text of it um of what he has been experiencing and then we have this red book in the end
that is visually impressive just impressive and also the style of it is very much in line with how he
has had his revelations with this tone of wisdom that that is in it and then my idea is that jung did
two things with it so on the one hand jung um takes the content from what he has been uh experiencing and
makes a theory out of it and here we can see that jung is a true creative thinker he's really thinking
out of the box compared to freud so there is an innovation in in jung's work um and where does the
innovation start from well from the from the revelation in his own experience um and my idea of
course is also that it is because jung did this and and and dared to to interact with how the unconscious
was speaking in him that he he didn't go crazy he had his very peculiar experiences but he didn't go
crazy he he kind of found find the stability around it and and and maybe like a certain
savoir-faire a certain wisdom of of of how to deal with it but at the other hand jung kind of keeps
having his entire life this eccentricity which was already there in the way he was um making that red book
but in in in in in my book and in in in the yellow book um i described how jung in his later life was
building a um a castle um at the at the border of of of lake um zurich where he kind of recreated
a medieval-like atmosphere and um well for me it's it's it's a kind of atmosphere a creative micro
universe that is very much in line with how in his mind primary process associations were working
and so for me like jung is a very sublime uh illustration of how when you move away from
convention uh and all kinds of strange revelations come into your world how nonetheless you can find a
stability and be very creative because that's what he was um and how do we see bricolage here
it's it's it's it's because it's like in the creative combination of things that that something
happens um and therefore i also think that psychotic experiencing and psychotic creation
is actually very good for our culture and why is it very good for culture because it is there that new
ideas are born for example yeah so it's of course not all creation comes from psychosis but i do think
that psychosis is a really creative force at a cultural level and so here again i return to the
first idea about uh how madness is linked to human freedom um i think that um freedom of mind and out
of the box thinking and um letting go conventions and experiencing something new is often related to
to psychotic creating um okay yeah it's a nice way to wrap it up i think but let's open it up to the to the
people joining us today um first first uh come first serve let's say
