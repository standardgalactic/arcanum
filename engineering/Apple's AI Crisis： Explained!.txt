Giant company is late to massive technological shift,
fails to adapt, falls behind and never recovers, dies.
That is a tale as old as time, and it does repeat itself.
Now, Apple is the biggest tech company in the world.
They're worth $3 trillion.
They have more cash on hand than anyone can ever spend.
They are extremely successful in many categories,
and they've taken down many other tech companies along the way.
But now, the year is 2025, and between missed deadlines and deleted commercials,
it seems like even they are having some troubles with an emerging technology,
and it is fascinating to watch.
So, artificial intelligence.
You guys don't need me to say it.
You already know.
The explosion of consumer AI in the past couple years has been nuts.
How many times have you heard those two letters next to each other?
So, suddenly, everyone for the past two, three, four years
has been talking a lot more about AI.
And two years doesn't even really sound like that long.
But tech moves fast.
Remember Skype?
Remember how Skype was, like, the default for online video calling?
And then the pandemic happened in 2020.
And then, like, two years later, everyone used Zoom.
How did they blow that?
Like, that's how fast tech moves.
Now, Apple is a lot bigger than Skype was,
but none of these companies are immune.
Like, every one of these big public tech companies,
all these companies are beholden to making as much money as possible.
They have shareholders.
They have investors.
And if they don't think you're doing everything you can
to grow as much as possible, they're not going to be happy.
So, when a certain ChatGPT comes along
and gets 100 million users in two months
and seems to prove that AI is definitely
the next frontier of consumer technology,
well, then, you start seeing a lot of tech companies
suddenly talking a lot more about AI.
So, now you're Apple.
And this is all happening.
All eyes are on you.
There's a lot of pressure to show some sort of AI something.
Now, there is some conventionalism that would say,
hey, Apple, take a second, sit back, relax,
do your typical second mover thing.
You don't have to rush this.
Because there are a lot of examples
where Apple is not necessarily first to something.
They sort of sit back and let someone else do the working on it
and the maturing of the technology happens.
And then they jump in and implement it their own way.
So, they were not first to do OLEDs in their phones.
They were not first to do wireless earbuds.
They were not first to make a tablet.
The iPhone itself is a perfect example.
There were so many other smartphones before the iPhone,
but they just executed on it in a way
that differentiated them so well that people wanted theirs.
The thing is, this second mover strategy
is very much a hardware strategy.
At least it typically has been.
And this AI thing is different.
It is very much just been these companies
iterating as fast as possible
and just moving and trying to implement
as much as they can with these little on-device models
to give people whatever useful features they can come up with.
And just throw them out there.
So, on a Google device, that looks like Circle to Search
and Gemini Assistant and Gemini Live
and the Add Me camera feature
that lets you take two pictures and fuse them together
to get everyone in the group shot.
Stuff like that.
On a Samsung device, that's Galaxy AI.
You know, they have things like
that really impressive object removal.
On a Windows 11 computer, that's gonna look like Copilot.
You know, adding an AI editor into Microsoft Paint.
Stuff like that.
Now, certainly, not all of this has gone super smoothly.
There's been plenty of weird, rocky launches
with companies like the recall feature from Windows.
They got some backlash and people didn't love.
Lots of stuff has not been ideal.
There have even been whole startups
that were born and died
just trying to jump on the AI bandwagon as best they can.
But at this point, basically,
every big tech company has something that they do
that they can point at and be like,
all right, look, see, we do AI.
You can see we're being useful to our customers
so you investors can relax.
We're on the forefront of it now.
So then, what does Apple do?
Well, same idea, right?
At WWDC 2024, they announced Apple Intelligence,
which, again, is just a branding umbrella term
for all the AI stuff they're gonna do
across iPhones and iPads and Macs.
Things that involve using generative models
and large language models.
On the surface, it's kinda along the same lines.
A couple silly features here and there,
Genmoji, Image Playground
to just generate random cartoonish images.
But there have also been some useful things
like writing tools and chat GPT integration,
and then big promises of significant upgrades
to make Siri actually good
because it's been lagging behind and bad for years.
So on the surface, you know,
feels right in line
with a lot of these other companies are doing.
A lot of it, kinda silly and easy to ignore,
especially if you're not an investor,
but some of it, potentially really cool.
I know I, for one, would like Siri to be decent.
So I remember being there at WWDC in the summer
when they announced Apple Intelligence
and thinking, oh, okay, great.
I would like to review this thing
when it all finally comes out.
So a couple months go by,
September rolls around,
the iPhone 16 launches
and it's built from the ground up
for Apple Intelligence.
And so it has iOS 18,
but it doesn't have any Apple Intelligence features
at launch at all.
Like literally none of it.
It's all still pending with software updates.
Oh, okay.
But at least, you know,
there's some betas coming up in the pipeline.
So a few weeks later,
iOS 18.1 comes out
and then it's got some of the features.
It's got writing tools, notification summaries.
So it's starting to have some stuff that I can test,
but it is missing a lot of the bigger stuff.
And also notification summaries
kind of turned out to be not that great all the time.
A few more weeks go by
and then iOS 18.2 drops in beta
and they added Genmoji and Image Playground.
It also added that ability
to kick out more complex queries to chat GPT.
So, I mean, okay, it's progress
and I'm glad it works
and people can generate cartoon images on their phone.
But like, is that really the core of Apple Intelligence?
Have we really seen that yet?
I'm still thinking, no, I'm gonna keep waiting.
I'm not reviewing Apple Intelligence yet.
So a few more weeks later, we get iOS 18.3.
At this point, we're months away
from the original iPhone launching
built for Apple Intelligence,
but this time they flipped the switch
on visual intelligence,
which I think is the first genuinely really useful,
interesting thing, using the camera feed
to answer questions about your environment
or add an event to your calendar from a poster,
things like that.
But it also did disable notification summaries
for news and entertainment apps
because of all the mistakes it was making.
But there is still no improved Siri.
This new Siri is supposed to have all this great stuff
like on-screen awareness and being more conversational
and having more in-app controls,
but none of that is launched.
And at this point, I just don't know when it's coming.
So I eventually just did a review
of all of the Apple Intelligence features
that are out so far
because I don't know when the rest are coming.
And I thought that would be helpful,
but at the same time, it's frustrating
because they promised so much and yet...
So this is where it gets kind of weird,
not to get too existential,
but this job that I do,
that we do, these tech YouTubers
and tech journalists, things like that,
you can kind of boil it all down
to just going around
and just doing endless tech demos.
Like we just go from tech demo to tech demo
and it's other people's jobs professionally
to give us cool tech demos.
And then we can point a camera at it
or write an article.
And then our job is to,
one, decide if the thing that they're demoing
is a good idea or not,
but then two,
to try to understand
how real that tech demo actually was.
That's really what it is.
It's just cool tech demos left and right.
So like a new product might come out
and get announced
and they show it to us
and they're like,
check this out.
And part one again is,
okay, are these new features in this thing
actually a good idea?
Would people want that?
And then part two
is to try to listen to the words
coming out of their mouth
and look at what's happening
and understand,
is this tech demo real
or staged
or completely fake
or somewhere in between?
So then Apple,
you know,
I would say is typically,
they do a pretty good job.
Like in the spectrum
of how crazy things can get,
like they're pretty realistic about things
like the new iPhone comes out on stage
and then they shepherd everyone
to this hands-on area.
And then we get to point a camera at
and demo in our own hands
a lot of the new features
that they just announced.
So in general,
pretty good,
but it's not always perfect.
Fun fact,
I don't know how many of you remember
air power,
but that was one of those things
where I remember that event,
they showed it off on stage,
whatever,
and then we go out
to the hands-on area
and there was a single air power out there,
just one wireless charging pad
among all the chaos,
but it didn't work.
So you could put your phone on it
and pretend it charges,
but it didn't.
And maybe that should have been
a red flag right there
because of course,
as we know,
air power never came out.
I think Tesla's robots
are another pretty recent,
like famous one.
We all remember that show
that they put on.
They had those humanoid robots
walking around their event,
interacting with people.
Tesla would never confirm
or tell people exactly
what was going on behind the scenes
to make that all possible,
but there were plenty of theories
about them being remote operated
or human controlled.
Anyway,
Apple intelligence
is one of those things
where they've had this slow,
continuous rollout
where the most interesting
and possibly most important things
are at the end of the rollout,
but there's no timetable.
They're just kind of coming
at some point.
And Apple's never demoed them for us.
It's really interesting.
John Gruber pointed this out
in his piece a little while ago
that this could be
an even more glowing bright red flag.
Apple has never shown
these features working to anyone.
And I mean,
you'd think if they could
demo it to a reporter
or YouTuber or something
that they totally would.
They'd love to show
it's almost done,
just here's how cool it is,
but they haven't.
And the fact that
they haven't even gotten
to the cool tech demo part yet
kind of makes it feel like
this is a lot farther away
than we think it is.
Now,
all of this is true
at the same time
that Apple is literally
running commercials
and billboards
and plastering Apple intelligence
all over their website
and every announcement.
They talk about it all the time
to the point that you'd assume
it's like the most important
new feature of their devices.
They even had to delete
a commercial that they made
and published.
They had to take it back
because it was literally
just advertising a new feature
of this big Siri update
that doesn't exist yet.
It's like looking into your phone
and using context
to tell you something.
That straight up didn't work.
Siri,
what's the name of the guy
I had a meeting with
a couple of months ago
at Cafe Grinnell?
You met Zach Wingate
at Cafe Grinnell.
Hey!
Zach!
I didn't think
you'd remember me.
Yeah, of course.
Since I saw you,
I'm like,
it's Zach.
Nobody looks like Zach.
I am genius!
You know,
I think it would be cool
if Siri actually could
look into your phone
and into your apps
and calendar
and actually tell you
things about it,
but it can't.
And we've never seen
a demo of this
outside of this commercial
or Apple's official videos.
So yeah,
this disconnect
between how successful
Apple would like us
to believe
that they are with AI
and how poorly
and delayed things
are actually going,
that is the crisis
on Apple's hands right now.
It's fascinating to watch.
And you know,
it's totally fine
to delay products.
Like,
that happens all the time.
It's actually very normal.
But just with AI,
with how immediate it feels,
with it being this
paradigm shift
of technology
and all of their competitors
shipping things,
it feels like things
are moving very quickly.
So that's how you end up
with apparently
internal meetings
and reorganization
and people inside of Apple
calling it embarrassing.
To people paying
close attention to Apple,
I think Apple Intelligence
has from the beginning
kind of always felt
more like a nice thing
to please investors
more than an actually useful
revolutionary set of products
that regular people
are going to love.
But now that it's so delayed
and the disconnect
is so obvious,
it's never been more apparent.
Remember Nokia?
They were huge.
And then they kind of
just completely missed
the jump to smartphones.
And now,
we don't think about Nokia anymore.
I'm sure you remember Blackberry.
They were also once thought of
as way too big to fail.
And then virtual keyboards
came along.
And Blackberry just continued
making phones
with physical keyboards.
and then everybody
just moved along
and now we don't talk
about Blackberry anymore.
There's countless examples
of huge tech companies.
We thought they were
way too big to fail
but then they failed
to adapt in some way
to the changing tides
of technology.
Something happens
and then they're just gone
and we don't know
what happened to them.
And so there's no way
to tell the future
on this one.
Maybe,
maybe everything's fine.
Maybe Apple ships
the new Siri
in two months
and it does everything
they said
and it's great
and we just forget
any delay ever even happened.
But there's three things
that have been on my mind
that kind of make
that feel unlikely.
So,
number one is just that
AI is just not
at the core
of Apple's business
right now
and if you're just looking
at it from a business
perspective,
they make a ton of money
selling hardware,
selling the services
and the things
attached to that hardware
and they will continue
to make tons of money
iterating and doing all that
like they usually do.
Financially,
they'll probably be fine.
Like it's kind of hard
to draw a straight line
from Apple intelligence
is successful
to Apple making
way more money,
especially when they're
such a privacy-focused
company as well.
Like a lot of these features
don't go hand-in-hand
with that.
But then two,
their usual advantages
don't really work here
as much as they usually do.
So like the second mover
advantage thing
that I talked about earlier,
like that's typically
a hardware technologies thing
and so AI being software
with software,
Apple's usually able
to just rely on
their massive,
enthusiastic army
of developers
to support things
and give it a kickstart
and get it off the ground
to get people using it.
And with this,
it's kind of the opposite.
I don't think
they're interested in this.
Like to think if I'm Uber,
if I'm developer for Uber
and this new Siri
is supposed to be able
to reach into my app
and perform an action
like calling a car,
so the user just goes,
hey Siri,
call me an Uber
to the airport
and then it does it
without ever opening my app,
that's,
I don't actually like that very much.
That gives me less control.
I don't get to do as much
with that experience,
even though it would be
really cool for the end user.
But then number three,
just the lack of demos
is like really,
it's actually very hard to ignore
just from someone
who's seen so many.
Remember,
remember the Bixby speaker?
Like all those years ago
at a Samsung event,
they announced the Galaxy speaker
is what it was called.
It looked like this little
mini barbecue grill
and in person,
we all go to this event
and then we go down
to the hands-on area
and they had a bunch of them
on display
and they were lit up
and nobody could actually
touch them or use them.
And then I think
we maybe saw them
one more time
at a display at CES,
but then we just
never saw them again.
Samsung canceled it.
They never shipped the thing.
I don't think
Apple wants to pull
a Bixby speaker
or an AirPower
with this thing.
Like Apple Intelligence
has gotten so much PR
and it's clearly
so important to them
that it just feels like
it's got to get there eventually.
It's got to be frustrating
for them to not have
the ability to show it off
or ship anything yet,
but it would be pretty cool
if Siri was good,
but we'll very much
just still have to wait
and see.
They're still Apple.
They're still just going
to keep shipping
new computers,
tablets,
software,
phones,
the whole thing
and they will continue
to iterate on other stuff,
but this is just something
to be keeping our eye on
for the future,
especially as this whole
AI thing continues
to ramp up
and as they continue
to put billboards out there.
So here's the video
with someone who needs
the explanation.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys
the next one.
Peace.
