critical is realistic carbon budgets because they are out of date and they're not realistic
and they're not going to achieve the Paris goal so even if we get to net zero by 2050
we're going to be way above the temperatures we're aiming for as we talked about that means
way more risk than people expect and it's a bit like a broken record on this but
where there is uncertainty there's a thing called the precautionary principle if you think it might
be a crocodile don't get in the water and that's kind of what we're doing the opposite of the
precautionary principle where there's uncertainty we're excluding it and crossing our fingers and
hoping everything goes in our direction
hello and welcome to planet critical the podcast for a world in crisis my name is rachel donald i'm
a climate corruption journalist and your host every week i interview experts who are battling
to save our planet my guests are scientists politicians academics journalists and activists
they explain the complexities of the energy economic political and cultural crises we face today
revealing what's really going on and what they think needs to be done these are the stories of
the big picture go to planetcritical.com to learn more and subscribe my guest this week is sandy trust
sandy is an actuary he's the head of organizational risk at mng the chair of the financial resilience
nature work stream for the climate financial risk forum and he's also the lead author on a number of
papers which have been published by the institute and faculty of actuaries in the uk in collaboration
with the university of exeter and these papers explain the link between our economies and the earth
systems revealing the extent of the risk to both if we continue as we are this is sandy's second time on the show
he joined me last year to discuss the emperor's new climate scenarios a paper which showed how climate
change modeling was dramatically underestimating the risks both to the earth and to our global economy
today he joins me to discuss their new paper planetary solvency which builds on the original paper to
show the underlying assumptions that are baked into climate change modeling the flawed risk methodologies
underpinning climate policy the failure to understand and communicate risk with regards to an
increasingly uncertain future due to our changing climate the necessity of modeling and what the impact
to our economy human mortality nature and society will be if we continue with these flawed climate change
policies a future which they model could see one-fifth of the global economy lost by 2050 on this episode
we discuss this report in full with sandy really going into detail about how risks should be adequately
calculated unsurprisingly to listeners of this podcast it's all about a systems approach and
understanding risks in relation to one another rather than understanding them in isolation we then go on to
explore how government-led policies have tended to have a positive impact in countries around the world
and that our market-led approach to dealing with the climate crisis has failed to address the root causes
and failed to actually mitigate against any of the worsening risks that we're facing we discuss whether or not
people's ability to confront the reality of the risks of this century is due to willful blindness ideology
or even deeply flawed economics some of which still underpins a lot of climate policy around the world
sandy talks about the difference between scientists job with regards to certainties and actuaries job
with regard to possibilities and risk management and if you read this paper you will really see how
it was obviously written by an interdisciplinary team of actuaries and scientists who are using their
combined expertise and understanding earth systems and then understanding risk to reveal just how much danger we
are possibly in this century if we do not change course finally we end with sandy explaining what
needs to happen to our net zero policies if we are to adequately mitigate risk and confront the
challenges of this century which could include widespread mortality widespread loss of human life
widespread loss of the natural world catastrophic societal upheaval and the worsening collapse of our earth

planet critical it's a real pleasure to have you on the show again rachel thank you i'm deeply honored to be
invited back so thank you very much great to be here well when you contacted me with your new report
obviously we had to get you back on because that first episode about your report that we did last
year went really really really far and so hoping this update provides a little bit more data to people
and also encourages them to send it send it to your local mp everybody who's listening
yes dude that's exactly what they should do yeah right sandy first question as usual why is the world in
crisis such a good question um i'm going to try answering this with some poetry rachel
rather than rather than face into reality deny distract obfuscate absurd of course bizarre even
not to avoid not to avoid not to prepare not to change change course perhaps it has always been too much to
expect this shift of consciousness to expect wisdom from the sapiens a civilization built on energy and
materials and shared stories of collaboration just needed to heed the science to harvest
energy from a different source to harness that ingenuity and adaptation all the busy endeavor and drive to
change the great systems of humanity food education finance economy transport energy to change the beliefs of the humans those
those oh so carefully and expensively curated beliefs before they change the great systems of the planet
that great miracle the entry anti-entropic planet gaia the world system billions of years of life gathering energy and
creation creating order building organisms ecosystems biomes species metabolisms life insanely complex
delicate and delicious in its beauty a gift a bounty a resource to be exploited conquered even for planes holidays
netflix celebrities and mangoes in december this is success wealth life billions of years for this
things stuff distractions ease gossip social media forget the yawning precipice of climate change
catching all the fish and replacing them with plastic forget the obesity loneliness sadness and suicide
the migrants and the cities running out of water forget space junk and the sixth great extinction
who needs the amazon when you have amazon forget all this and more because well because the economy
silly forget the economy needs a society until ai trades bitcoins for the robots society needs somewhere to live
and food air water shelter community meaning we saw a way at the branch we're sitting on ignoring warnings it could bend or break
it hasn't yet stop your wolf crying antics why can't you be happy for the progress look at all the people
the wealth the wealth the technology well why can't you see the future distress heat fire flood food and
water shortages the mess quiet the football is on and the celebrities are dancing rather that than face reality
Sandy that's brilliant when you said you were going to do poetry i thought maybe you're going to like
quote ts elliott wasteland or something but that's fantastic you wrote that right i wrote that i wrote
that that's a sandy trust original that is brilliant and really i mean it encompasses everything and and
i love that the first person to come on this show and answer in poetry was an actuary because that
is the kind of interdisciplinary thinking we need yes more poetic actuaries oh more what actuaries yeah i
just i was i don't know sometimes you feel need to get something out and this we've talked about this
parallel reality of living your life being keenly aware of the risks we're facing so i just wanted to
try and capture some of that because i think it's astonishing how much trouble we're in and how
little mainstream knowledge there is at the level of risk which is probably a neat segue to the next
report oh you stole my line oh sorry that's a very neat segue now when we discussed this last time
you had a report out that was all about climate models essentially and the impact on the economy
and um i went with the title of a global economy won't survive because that's the leverage and the
freedom that i have as a podcaster now in the past year you and some of the core members core authors of
that report have been working on a new report about uh risk and how this is what actuaries do like looking at
the risks of what these models um are likely to play out how risk is being underestimated and the
diagnosis has not gotten better in the year since we last spoke in fact it seems to have firmed up that
we are currently on a trajectory that will see our current economy civilization our expectations
dramatically change by the end of the century yes yes yes i i guess as actuaries um
it's um it might it might sound a bit weird but the the real primary each of actuaries what actually
are legislated to do is actually to to stop failure to stop the failure of pension schemes to stop the
failure of insurance companies because uh society has a very low appetite for those things failing you
know if pension schemes fail people run out money that's really uh all sorts of societal um consequences
if insurance companies can't pay claims in the future likewise so really actually he's paid to think
about um risks what what could impact a pension scheme what might cause it not to have enough money
10 20 30 40 50 years into the future um not just risks but also combinations of risks which um might
might come together to cause that pension scheme to become insolvent to running funding in the future
um and and this is not a new idea for actuaries uh maybe we could take those techniques and actually uh apply them to the global risks we face and actually that might be quite quite powerful so rather than thinking about a pension scheme
running money money um the framing for planetary solvency is that uh our economy as you say that's the big hook needs a society and society
needs somewhere to live and that's what we call think of think of as the earth system
and that provides inputs to the economy energy raw materials but also food food water uh regulates the
climate breathable atmosphere etc so it really is the branch we're sitting on so planetary solvency
as opposed to financial solvency is assessing the ability of the earth system to keep providing
us with the things we need to have our nice nice society and netflix and planes and all that stuff
and um i mean give me the top headline uh if we continue as we are will our earth systems be able to
continue supporting our nice society yeah uh i think it's i think it's eminently plausible
that if we continue as we are we will experience what you might call extreme or catastrophic risk events
um so what do i mean by that what do i mean by by extreme or catastrophic um risk events there was a fantastic
paper written by luke kemp luke kemp was the lead author climate end game and that was published in 2022
2022 um and climate end game um said we we thought lots about climate change but we've thought mostly
about one and a half and two degrees maybe a hot household but we haven't thought very much about
what happens when it gets hotter and we haven't come up with what you might think of as kind of a risk
impact scale so if we get to two degrees of warming three degrees of warming um what what sorts of things
might be might be happening um and so luke and his co-authors um came up with a set of societal
impact terms so they said well we can't go around thinking that things will never get bad or there
isn't the possibility that things can get bad and referencing the actual work again um we're not saying
things will definitely get bad we're not doom-mongering the the very essence of risk management is
imagining things that could go wrong so that you can take action to prevent them so luke luke and his
co-authors said well we really need to kind of a taxonomy of risk so they define some terms like
systemic risk extreme climate change um three degrees on war by 2100 extinction threat societal collapse
global catastrophic threat global decimation risk also 10 percent of population or major disruption
and said you know this isn't this isn't um uh scaremongering this is just good risk management and
actually uh if you look at insurance regulation uh actually you have to support insurance companies
to do something called reverse stress testing sounds a bit weird doesn't it but what reverse stress
testing is is um come up with a scenario or scenarios which would cause cause your organization to become
insolvent and and see how you how you would survive and actually organizations have to go further
than that and actually have to provide a plan for if they do become insolvent so it's unorganized
fashion so so this isn't doom-mongering it's it's not fatalistic it's good risk management so planetary
solvency we said well um what if we took luke's work and we then expanded it so um rather than just
looking at climate change we looked at some other risk dimensions so you talked about the economy
so let's look at economic impacts and rather than limiting ourselves let's think about to use luke's
language what would a decimation event be a 10 percent hit the global economy what would
catastrophically a 25 percent hit global economy so we've got a climate dimension economic dimension
let's do mortality like there could be major mortality shocks if we don't change course so let's
put that on our scale and let's put nature on our scale as we have a dimension for nature and let's
put um societal impacts on our scale as well so if you look at catastrophic um people can see this in
the appendix reports we're saying so climate two degrees or more of warming by 2050 that's in my view
quite likely if you look at the current temperature and the pace of warming we cover that in the report
um what would nature impacts be so we'd say catastrophic might be breakdown of some critical
ecosystem services for people who are not sure what those are those are things like raw materials climate
regulation fresh water provision breakdown over some earth systems major extinction events in multiple
geographies and ocean circulations fairly impacted catastrophic societal impacts severe
socio-political fragmentation in many regions low-lying regions lost heat and water stress driving
voluntary mass migration of billions catastrophic mortality events from disease nutrition thirst and
conflict so again we're not saying this is a nailed uncertainty but we're trying to come up with a
sensible risk taxonomy for assessing global risks and communicating them to policyholders and the the
headline is that catastrophic or even extreme risk events uh are eminently plausible unless we change course
and what do i mean by change course i mean that we need really immediate policy action um because the
market-led approach we've had in place so far it is simply not delivering
moral suPer rain in place so that Habchi Venla
Florian just playing well honestly that's a it that's a the whole play of the climate policy
of climate which is virtually um that could be 이동 at that context than a shift of climate policy
for climate policy where climate policy deeper according to climate policy chính
and climate policy frameworks and climate policy plans more of what is climate policy itself
female action that's happening at one point five we can handle the fallout
andrewуб vamos or is it friendly for 2030 to comestrong Tok WINTHIS
model and a scenario as well for two and we're heading there so we can handle the fallout i mean
the idea that we could be pushing towards three degrees warming um which i don't think is implausible
either considering you know we've shot past the paris agreement in less than a decade um means
that on a policy level there's a kind of implication of like well things are going to happen
but there's you know that that's an acceptable risk but what you and your co-authors have shown
is that policymakers are dramatically underestimating the risks that they are accepting
through these frameworks and a part of that is because of this methodology that they've used
which you point out which is now i'm going to use the wrong language here i'm going to use more planet
critical language here but the methodology that they're using is not systemic like they are looking
at risk of certain things in isolation rather than taking into account tipping points for example where
there's a sort of cascading effect through the earth systems and then through society and thus
through the economy so could you speak more to that methodology that is typically baked into
climate policy and why you and your team think it's flawed i guess the first question is why does
risk management fail and it's a fantastic expedition exposition is margaret heffernan's will for blindness
risk management fails a lot perhaps it's because risks aren't understood so if you think about the
complexity of climate change and tipping points and the interaction of tipping points
a lot of people just don't understand that you have to be quite deep into it and perhaps it's because
risks aren't communicated well the challenger shuttled the last of its well established for that
that people were aware of weaknesses in the challenger's shuttle and had written about those risks
not being communicated the urgency was lost in scientific detail global financial crisis nobody saw that
coming and her late majesty queen elizabeth ii famously asked the london school of economics why why did
nobody see this coming um and they responded and said well really it was a failure of imagination we could
see individual risks we couldn't see risks to the system as a whole um so so there are there are a lot
of reasons why risk management fails um plus willful blindness you know often we just don't want to see
the risk you know much better if climate change wasn't happening so uh that there are lots of reasons risk
management fails and actually when you when you look at climate change and nature risks uh quite a lot
of those are present um the western reductionist mindset looks at risk in isolation so if i'm an
insurance company i will typically look at my credit risk my equity risk my insurance risk blah blah and
then sort of fudge them together a bit but i'm not looking at risk systemically um as you as you well
as you well know nature risks are a multiplier for climate risks and vice versa and they interact with
society and society's reaction can both make the risks worse and make the impacts worse by failing to prepare
so by looking at the risk in isolation you're understating them because you're you're excluding
the systemic effects so you're perhaps really considerably understating them a really good quick
example on this one the amazon forest tipping point best estimate temperature if you look at it from a
climate perspective it's three degrees warming if you take into account deforestation it's one and a
a half degrees of warming wow holy crap that's where we are already right deforested 17 of the amazon so
so the impact of taking into account the other risk drivers is massive so fairly to account systemic risk
um and i'm gonna and i'm not being pejorative here but science thinks very differently from risk if you
think about scientists um they typically won't publish something until they're quite sure of it and they
have the evidence and we have the scientific method and that's a good thing risk is the opposite risk you
want to talk about things even if they're highly uncertain particularly if they could be very severe
um and that's that word imagination you're imagining that there could be an iceberg and taking precautions
rather than saying i'm not going to say there's an iceberg until i've seen it and tasted it and
touched it licked it so so those factors um have meant that um rather than treading cautiously
when we're uncertain we've simply excluded the uncertainties and made decisions on
on those estimates that exclude the risk so last time we talked about that very famous economic estimate
of climate damages produced by nordhaus in 2002 and that came up with two or three percent gdp damage
by 2100 if we hit three degrees of warming and then you look at the methodology it was tipping points
nature impact uh human health impacts conflict migration um and it also excludes 87 of the
economy because they work indoors it might be impacted by climate change just every time i hear it
it drives me mad now for anybody listening that might not know i mean that astounding assumption that
you know 80 87 of the economy uh will not be affected because it's indoor he won the nobel prize in
economics for that work in 2018 which is just i mean it makes you want to cry really yeah and he was
floated um for that and um the original estimate was 2002 and actually it was a it's an important
question right important question for governments um what what might the economic impact of climate change
change be because that's going to determine how much of a priority it is now if you're a busy
politician or policy maker someone says to you rachel i've got the results back from a very respected
economist it's been peer-reviewed and the economic impact of climate change is going to be two percent gdp
your not unreasonable response is going to be right okay this sentence much less worse great exactly
thumbs up than what the scientists were saying um so it's a lower priority so we don't we don't need to
maybe move as fast as we ought to be moving um and that um estimate has proven to be remarkably sticky
so there's a really fantastic document produced by a company you may have heard of liberty energy so
chief chris wright's president elect trump's energy secretary and it's a great document it talks about
energy bettering human lives and how important energy is and all that kind of good stuff um and it does
talk about climate change clearly it's happening and it quotes nord is and that's the justification
for climate change being a low priority now i don't know chris wright but he's clearly a busy person
chief executive energy company is it reasonable to expect him to critically examine the assumptions
underpinning that estimate i don't think it is and i don't think it's reasonable for many people to do
that but that's what actuaries are trained to do so unfortunately that combination of what you call
scientific reticence and economic estimates of climate change that exclude uncertainty rather than
making a sense of assumption um have meant that policy makers by moving making decisions based on very
flawed risk information making decisions based on information that simply excludes the risks and
um i kind of call it climate modeling land and if if everyone listening blinks and open opens their eyes
you're now in climate modeling land it looks exactly like the real world because we're modeling the real
world but it's magical because as i've talked to you there are no tipping points no human health impacts
no nature impacts blah blah blah blah now now what has happened over time is the economic estimates of
climate change have got more severe as people have loaded more stuff in so i think the recent um
paper i think cots at al we reference it in the report um that's now saying i think something like an
expectation of a 19 gdp hit by 2050 on current trajectories so way way more damage than the
investment cost of executing the energy transition um but that that's hot off the press so policy makers
that hasn't yet reached policy makers circles i think that's really the whole thrust of this report is we
need policy makers to be presented with risk-led information informed by science not not science-led
information and the difference there if i use the analogy of crossing a river imagine you had to cross
a river i'm conscious you're about to head off to all sorts of exotic places so imagine you have to cross
a river a river in africa and you'd be interested in the depth of the river um particularly any deep pools
and you'd be interested to know if any crocodiles river and you might see something that looks like a log
but maybe it's a crocodile tell you what you're not going to go into that river until you've ascertained
it's a log now risk-led communication would say it is possible there is a crocodile in the river and
there is a deep pool science communication would say the average depth of the river is half a meter
and there may be other factors but we're not sure about them and so the science-led information would
simply exclude the crocodile whereas risk that information would major on the crocodile maybe
it's unlikely but the impact if it does happen is so significant we wouldn't enter the water
i think that's such a good analogy and i actually have to say your report is littered with good
analogies one of uh my favorite with regards to understanding how risk is currently calculated versus
how it should be calculated was um about the titanic and saying that you know in our current assessments
it's sort of like um you know think about the risk of hitting an iceberg rather than understanding
the risks of what hitting that iceberg would mean and how many people would end up in the water and
how many you know what would be the impact of hypothermia what would be the impact on you know
the ocean environment around it like really getting to grips with the wider system and all of these
these into connections now sunday i have to ask because it's been about a year since we spoke maybe
a little bit longer and that report i mean my audience um reaction to that report was i mean everybody
was sort of amazed i think it was very helpful that it has you know university of exeter stamped on it
and the institute and faculty of actuaries stamped on it um but did you manage to get it in front of
policy makers it it's been a year this isn't fresh off the press as you just said key key question um
i think we're making traction i don't think we're there yet um i've been working with the coalition
of finance ministers climate actions they're really trying to push this concept of risk-led messaging
into that group and i think finance ministry is really important and we have had some conversations
with labour mps but i think there's there's more to do and actually that's what we're calling for
in this report is um realistic systemic effective global risk management to be to be put in place we've
developed a set of principles the resilience principles are going to be a checklist of
principles for how to actually assess these global systemic risks effectively my real concern is that
if we don't get effective risk management practices in place delivered to the very highest levels of
policy makers we will continue to um you know go blindly go blindly forth towards these risks it's uh
yeah we've had some traction but we're not there yet it's just amazing when you think about the
contrast and i'm going to use um british examples um although there are characters like these everywhere
if you think about the contrast between what you're saying and you know the the possible risk to gdp
and you contrast that with characters like nigel farage and other tufton street you know proxy
employees going on mainstream television and and saying that you know we can't afford to do the
energy transition or net zero is going to cost us too much money like that's the radical message
that's out in the mainstream public consciousness which is you know gaining traction all the time despite
mounting evidence and then you compare it with this um and you know it would suggest that if gdp really
is the thing that we all care about and it should be the thing that is protected then you would think
that people would want to have this information in front of them would want to understand the risks
that were being taken um and would be keen to implement a series of policies that would protect
the economy at all costs because for the life of me that's what our you know politics seems to be
centered on in the west protecting the economy at all costs would they just it's just another one of
these cognitive dissonances that i cannot make sense of right and 100 agree but i mean i've not met
Nigel Farage um my my working assumption and maybe i'm being naive is that people who are not uh is
people well people operate to a set of beliefs and if in your circle you've seen the north house work
and actually a bunch of other works which show climate damages to be relatively small but you believe
you strongly believe it's all about the economy then it's it's not unreasonable now i obviously
disagree with that message i think we need to change the narrative to nets who is an economic and
financial imperative not unacceptable cost there are two parts to that uh one the comparison with the
damages as you've talked to you know is it conceivable well you can paint a scenario
uh where global warming continues to accelerate exacerbated uh by nature uh loss nature impacts
the significant socio-political consequences we have significant uh mortality events and gdb loss
um so the not having that outcome makes it much more positive but even uh the costs of a renewable energy
system are much much lower than uh a fossil so so you really need to change that narrative um but and
that's something we put in the report and that's where uh this risk-led messaging makes it very clear you
you know if we don't change course then these extreme or catastrophic impacts are eminently
plausible whether on on those dimensions we talked about economy population climate nature disruption
um but we also call for what they call education training etc because as you and many of your listeners
so our current economic model is energy blind and it's climate blind and it's ecosystem blind so although
the economy is literally built on raw materials and energy our current economic model doesn't see that it
sees labor and capital so we have a deeply flawed model and you know a generation of leaders who
have mostly been educated on that economic model so yes we have to have the risk-led messaging but
we also have to have that consciousness shift because currently we have these two kind of parallel systems
the earth system our life support system and the economic system which now has kind of a loose coupling
over the earth system but has very different objectives from most of the humans and other
creatures that live in the earth system so um well planetary is very much focused on the risk message and
putting in place these kind of risk management principles and reporting and that very strong message
that if we don't change we're also heading for extreme or catastrophic risk levels um we're also strongly
pointed to the the need for that education that mindset shift that shift shift in consciousness because
we've western reductionism has created a world where the financial system sees itself as separate from the real
economy which sees itself as separate from nature the earth system etc which actually provides everything
we need so there is work to do there's one final point i want to tease out here sandy and that's about net
zero um you referenced before we started recording james dyke who came on the show uh a couple of months ago
talking about entropy you know his episode uh and some of his work has essentially shown that you know and i'm
going to paraphrase here but like net zero was in a sense like a kind of misleading goal because it's
actually you know facilitated the continuation of of extractivism um exploitation and it also just
hasn't worked um you've said in your report that um current climate models aren't fully understanding
risk but you also just said that net zero is a financial imperative so what are the changes that need to
be made to be made to net zero policies broadly to make it effective for mitigating against the worst
risks that we face this century oh what a great question cut so i'd go with a couple of things
if you look at transition success stories they are policy driven norway has over 90 of new car sales
electric and that's due to policy um britain has lots of offshore wind and that's due to policy
you know britain doesn't have offshore wind because this is 20 years ago you and me and a lot of other
people said let's build wooden farms it was a government energy policy decision so um perhaps uh the biggest
and you look at the pace that china is moving this might be a big emitter government policy um so it's it's
very clear to me that the market-led approaches will not deliver and government policy needs to deliver
i'm gonna go down a a tiny rabbit hole here and you'll be familiar with the personal carbon footprint
concept and you'll probably know exactly where that came from came from fossil fuel companies and
brilliant because you you distract from government energy policy decisions if everybody's talking about
personal carbon footprints playbook copied by the plastics industry in response to us congress
first talking about plastics in 19 in the 50s in the 50s and they created this narrative that it's about
recycling and that's very embedded even today so so that's the biggest shift we need to see is that
this needs to be led by government policy um the other big shift which is critically important
is we need to be realistic about carbon budgets um edinburgh has done some big infrastructure projects
recently built built a tram built a new parliament building uh the budgeting for both those projects was
absolutely horrific they cost you know 50 or 100 times what they were budgeted for
now carbon budgets are very uncertain because the earth system is very uncertain so you have lots of
feedback loops potential tipping points i was reading a report this morning that says that the arctic has
tipped from a carbon sink to carbon source in in 2024 um i know right i know so the amazon might tip etc so
so carbon budgets are predicated on no tipping points no surprises and a range of other assumptions
like are the greenhouse gas levels not increasing but we know that methane is increasing blah blah blah
so if you look at the assumptions underpinning carbon budgets they're heroic heroic to say the least when
you take them take them together and and again borrowing from actuarial work if you run an insurance
company you have to make assumptions about the future and every year you test your assumptions and
adapt them uh uptake them we're not doing that with carbon budgets so we're at one and a half degrees
of warming so for either carbon budget has to be negative now are you worried what's called overshoot
no people will say but that's all right we're going to come back to one and a half degrees by 2100
well again check out the plausibility of the assumptions of the overshoot scenarios scientists
looked at 1200 overshoot scenarios this was a few years ago now i think they found six
which they felt had plausible assumptions many of those right yes the antibodies are raised
like a stunningly small amount i think we wrote about that in climate scorpion and if you look at the
assumptions in many of the overshoot scenarios they assume things like we will draw down from the
atmosphere every year more carbon than we ship fossil fuels annually nuts so um the the the policy
support is absolutely critical to kind of accelerate the technology disruption there's kind of positive
s curves of technology disruption which we're starting to see in many locations a fantastic
report out from rocky mountain institute but equally critical is realistic carbon budgets because
they are out of date and they're not realistic and they're not going to achieve the paris goal so even
if we get to net zero by 2050 we're going to be way above the temperatures we're aiming for as we talked
about that means way more risk than people expect and it's a bit like a broken record on this but
where there is uncertainty there's a thing called the precautionary principle if you don't know if you
think it might be a crocodile don't get in the water don't assume it's you know and and that's kind of
what we're doing the opposite of the precautionary principle where there's uncertainty we're excluding it and
crossing our fingers and hoping everything goes in our direction so uh the uh a specific recommendation
we make on climate changes that should be an annual process to update carbon budgets and because because
currently there is increasing awareness over one and a half degrees and but it's kind of nobody's job and
everybody's job to work out what to do about that but it's going to become it is already i think very
clear that net zero would deliver the paris goals and we need to update those budgets sunday thank you
very much this is um fascinating as always uh grim as always but the fact that yeah i'm quite a cheerful
person i know i'd like not to be doing this wouldn't we all wouldn't we all like to be doing
something just quite nice all just reciting you know poetry together on a saturday night
not reading reports about our ed systems collapsing now um now am i correct am i fair to say sandy in a
you know in a previous conversation this was a figure that we came out and i really wanted to pull this
out in the episode if it's correct are we looking at possibly a 50 drop in gdp by the by 20 70 possibly
yeah i mean that's we've we've published that previously other organizations have published
analysis showing that level of gdp gdp impact these what's important for people to understand is
these are models there are lots of ways of doing the modeling depending on how you do the modeling
um you get different answers um every model is a simplification you have to decide what to include
what not to include there are various ways to do the to do the math um we think though it's much more
sensible to work backwards from ruin than working forwards from unrepresentative past and excluding
all the risks from your model and we'd much we'd suggest it's much better to
adopt a prudent approach and more severe damages than it is not to so that that particular
um analysis i'm like i've got it in front of me um i think we said 50 damage at maybe three
degrees of warming and depending on how quickly you warm that was the 2017 to 2019 piece right depending
on some of the assumptions you make so um at the current rates of warming is is it possible we could
hit three degrees by 2050 well some people might say that's very likely but it's certainly possible
um although it would be very bad um so could you see based on that rationale 50 gdb damage by 2050
well potentially now i've put that forward to people as this this should be our downside stress
that this should be the measure that is we're using to incentivize action and the response i get is
well how do you know like well i don't but this is called risk management let's imagine multiple
tipping points catastrophic food system impacts water shortages and bodily mass migration how can you
justify not having really significant impacts um and you know fully accepting this is not all about
gdp clearly there's potential for immense human immiseration and natural catastrophes not to mention
the natural world so so yeah i mean my my strong views it's um better to be sanguine and prudent
about the potential downside risks and use that analysis to guide the action you take than
continuing to stick your fingers in your ears ignore the difficult stuff and hope for the best
but it's so much easier no we could go back and forward
um sandy this is really interesting thank you so much for this um i will make sure that the links to
the report are available for everybody so they can go and download it and read it themselves
my final question for you is who would you like to platform
luke camp
luke's been a fantastic co-author i think he and some of his colleagues in the existential risk space think
deeply and carefully about this sort of stuff this sort of stuff so and he's a in particular
in particular a scholar of societal collapse so i think he would be
have a lot to say brilliant sounds like just the kind of guest for fun at gridsville
yes he's a pretty upbeat guy as well i love that i find that we all tend to be because
if you're not laughing you're crying right right you have to be
