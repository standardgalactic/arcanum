there we go hello mike good to see you yeah so how have you been oh i've been pretty good um
getting around the world too much but otherwise you've been very busy i mean you're always very
busy but um the reason we're talking now is because you sent me that um remarkable paper
which with your permission um i put up on my subset um and uh which i think is is going to be the
contribution to to that book uh from the conference about my stuff in california last year um so i'm
very grateful for that and for the ideas and i thought there's just a lot of richness in it and
it would be worth talking about it absolutely absolutely thank you so much um i i value very
you know really really value your uh your opinion and uh taking the time to to read it so that's
that's great um i hope um i i so i hope you i'll send you the latest version for the for your um for
your site in a reading because i'm not sure oh okay i'm not sure i'm not sure if i had the you know
whatever what what what you had at the time you put it up i'm not sure if it's the latest one so
so i'll send you the latest one but um i think it was version 23 if that's anyhow yeah that's that's
pretty good close enough close enough but no i'd like to have it and then i can put that up instead
yeah yeah yeah yeah yes so and i saw you did something with my friends alex gomis marine the
other day i did i did yeah we had a we had a very good yeah we had a very good discussion yeah yeah yeah
yeah i love i love i love talking to him yeah he's great he's a good man yeah there was a whole lot of
things that um i think it would be interesting to talk about i mean mainly on a philosophical level
but then i mean i'm glad to say you're not frightened of philosophy which is which is
completely wonderful because it's not true of every biologist and i do think that philosophy and science
um need to need to walk hand in hand really i mean either of them is lacking if it doesn't have the
other so um so what what would you say about the idea that um i think you you would agree with you
seem to say that intelligence uh goes all the way down really i mean in in everything not just in life
actually is that right i mean the whole cosmos is is imbued with a kind of intelligence i yeah yeah i
think that's i think that's fair and so would you say you're a pan psychist i i am um with a with a
little bit of a twist in that i i think the typical pan psychist position which is one thing it gets
critiqued a lot for is is the is this idea that well the the the consciousness or the mind of the
collective has to be in some way a sum of or you know creative so there's some sort of addition
problem right so so right so i think that's not a thing i i think i think yes the parts have it and
the whole has it and and it's not a it's not a it's not an addition problem oh thank goodness you said
that because a lot of people have said to me because i think in a way i'm a pan psychist you know
but what about the combination problem and i said well it's only a combination problem if you think
about it in the wrong way if you think about it as having to be the sum of a whole lot of different
parts but in fact it's something that as you say both in the whole and in the parts is pregnant with
if you like to put it that way with some some kind of mind some kind of intelligence um which i think
is also characterized by by goal directedness and and that by that i certainly don't mean that there is
a determinist outcome there is a deterministic outcome but there is nonetheless direction and
direction doesn't doesn't close down possibility at all but it seems to me that we now have to give
up the idea that um that which was given up by by by physicists i guess some time ago but the idea that
really everything is just random and has no sense of order or direction to it yeah yeah i you know i think
this i think this combination problem comes from from two underlying motivations one is that i think
people really want to as as is for example codified in iit they want there to be only one mind in
anything right so if you have a system you you the you know the parts it's if it's made of parts well
let's you know show us the one you know kind of mind it has and the part we can forget about what the
parts are doing so so i think that's a problem is that you try to write i mean i i like i like a continuous
heterarchy of overlapping minds right and then and then the other and then the other is the even
more pervasive thing that we we somehow make minds and so the idea is that from from these things
we're going to create this uh this uh you know this thing from sort of from from scratch and then and
then you have this combination problem because you have to say well how did you how exactly you know
was yeah yeah so yeah i think if we can if we avoid those two things then then i don't think there's a
combination problem no no i i completely agree um and it it's a relief because i hadn't read you
saying that and as i say it's a constant um uh gripe i have said that this is this is the thing in
in some ways it's a thing in my terms very much as the left hemisphere will construe the world that
it's made up of bits and uh the bits um i have you know everything that you find in it can be accounted
for in the in in the um in the putting together of these parts we put it together in in the way that
we put machines together and i know you i mean we need to talk about that but i know you say that
effectively there is no difference between the machine and the organism i mean i think
i i don't know whether you deny that but i think that there are profound differences between
mechanisms and organisms but i draw the line i don't say that there is a a sharp line that divides
in what we call inanimate matter from animate matter in other words life i think it is a matter of degree
and i think like you that there is um a a a wholearchy if you like in which things are nested
and in that wholearchy um we we have the inanimate as well as the as the animate and the difference is
that the animate is just somehow a billion fold more responsive to whatever it is that we find this
intelligence this directional um process this lure towards things um another very important idea that
things are not simply pushed blindly from behind but actually are attracted towards things i mean
you say somewhere the the sort of the important attractor in the morphosphere i think is the word
probably um that that draws things towards them do you want to say anything about that
yeah um a couple things well we can we can talk about the machine uh organism thing and i completely
agree with you that on that spectrum there are regions which we have become which we have named
which which have vastly different properties and and and and of course it makes sense that to to
distinguish these things as a as a kind of a large um uh large categories of things but i think also
but anyway we can we can talk about that i want to talk about the just just for a second the attraction
bit um this is this is very much uh in progress so i don't have anything concrete yet to show you
although there's other people that have done relevant things but um i've been working on uh this scenario where
we have we we view um so let's say you have an agent that's that's sort of exploring some problem
space so they're trying to find a solution um i've been i've been working on us and on a on a
formalization where the solution is basically reaching out to the agent as much as the agent is
reaching out to the right so a symmetry in this great and the weirdest and the weirdest thing about it
so so you know we can sort of like it almost maybe people i think people can almost buy that on a kind
of human creativity scale that right that you're you know that these things are like drawing you right
calling to you yes yes exactly right so so create i think all creative people have this this experience
right that the thing is sort of but but um the thing that i want to do is as i like to do is to show
what that looks like all the way down and when i say all down what i mean is for example when you have
um molecular binding so you have right in in the in every cell biology textbook there's a pathway and
they say well this thing you know this this this this protein that's made over here and then it goes
and finds its binding partner and then it kind of and there's your pathway right so so i remember and
i don't know what the latest uh i need i need to figure this out what the latest quantitative
models of this are but i remember some some years back um uh roy frieden did a calculation at a
conference in arizona state of like how long would it actually take for things in a cell given realistic
you know diffusion constants and things like this how long would it actually take for anything to find
its binding partner because because the problem is that you don't get the reward so to speak until you
act so the free energy doesn't drop until you actually get to the thing and then you bind that that's
great but along the way there's no credit right there's no partial credit there's no gradient you
just sort of you just sort of hang out until you find you know what right and according to that
calculation it would be completely unsupportable you know millions of years for anything to find
and so and so so we're working on some things to look at what does that actually look what what would
you know uh synchronicity um this this kind of uh another way you know this library angel phenomenon
right that you know you're you're sort of you're working on some problem you're walking through a
library this you know book falls down you're like oh look and there's the right so what what does that
look like all the way down what does that look like on the molecular level what you know what what
are what could we could we say that there are ways in which um the solution to your problem or your
binding partner in the case of the chemistry or some other things in ai and so on are attracting you
as much as you're searching for them so that's you know these are very early days but that's that's some
stuff we're working that's fascinating and and um for me expresses a very important point about
existence full stop which is that everything everything is relational the the idea that
there are just these things and then either we find they have relations or we make the relations
between them is again this very reductive view that i associate with i mean i'm not just using this
metaphorically this is the way the left hemisphere works whereas i think the idea that things are in
a kind of partnership in other words that there is um interdependence uh to use this rather wonderful
word which is the title of kriti sharma's book on the relationship between an organism and its
environment not that they just interact serially the the organism affects the environment the
environment infects the organism but they literally co-create one another so they're coming into being
together now you could apply that view to the idea of the solution arriving um much faster you think
reaching out to the problem that the problem is really a a manifestation of a felt a potential solution
and the solution is the manifestation of a potential problem and they come together
it is extraordinary how these things do do appear to i mean i i think of a couple of examples um they
may well be drawn from your work that i use in the matter with things um one uh well-known one is if you
take um eyeless the the eyeless gene out of drosophila um obviously the the offspring have no eyes and if
you breed the eyeless flies their offspring have no flies no eyes but after 14 generations without the
gene they have the eyes so something is something very powerful is going on very rapidly that says no
eyes need to be had and simon conway morris suggests that eyes have been evolved i think he says 14
different times in the history of evolution it's an extraordinary thing that they evolved at all because
there's such a complex thing and lots of things have to come together but the idea that this could
have happened separately in different lineages 14 times is extraordinary and suggests that there is
definitely something about having an eye that is that is quite important and the other thing that i think
is is is interesting is the idea and it's closer to what you were saying um about it would take far
too long is that you know when a cell encounters a danger for which it is not in any way prepared
either programmatically or through experience it can it can develop um an enzyme or it can develop at any
rate a a change in its chemical media that will resolve that problem within
as little as four days whereas it would take billions of years if it was just relying on
randomness so this is all absolutely fascinating yeah yeah yeah um absolutely like like that that last
example yeah we we have examples of um planaria uh challenge with the barium um that that basically
causes their heads to explode and then within you know a lot of weeks time they come up with a new
solution uh that that enables them to make barium and sensitive heads out of a um problem space that's
like a 20 000 dimensional problem space you know and and so and so yeah we're very interested in
figuring out um how how they do it and i wonder i wonder what your thoughts are about um i've been
thinking about this just kind of really broadly this this issue of uh having this kind of relationship
with solutions in that space right let's say that i want to talk about the terminology too so maybe
platonic isn't isn't a good term as you pointed out but but but anyway um there's something i think
there's something interesting going on and i wonder i wonder what what you think about this like if you
look at at the very bottom of the level you have let's say let's say photons that um with least action
of principles they find their solution all you know 100 of the time they don't need complicated uh
internal machinery to calculate what which path should i take they just kind of effortlessly do
it right they're in that flow state so to speak like all the time then then then you have creatures
you know like like you know well like well i'm solving some sort of problem methodically plotting
across that space first they do this and then what does this mean and okay well maybe right so you're
fighting it's a lot of effort and you're sort of very carefully um um crawling along that space
and then you have and then you have the people who are creative geniuses and they don't need again
they're back to that initial state they don't need the step-by-step thing they say oh it's it's i
can see it it's obvious i you know i'm already there so what do you think about this this this this
this navigation of that of that space of ideas like how you know why it seems to be like a
strange u-shaped kind of thing yeah that's very interesting point and you quote don't you
um thing about you know it's not that we have to examine all the possibilities only a highly selected
group of possibilities present themselves for examination and in a way in the in the most
exotic examples of um insight by geniuses that they go almost immediately to that solution not always but
they do well i think i mean my view is that for what it's worth is that we are equipped with the
ability to follow algorithms because they are extraordinarily helpful in everyday living and you
know the left hemisphere is very much utilitarian one that does that kind of thinking and for a lot
of things in life you know problem what do i do i do this i do that and the other salt but
i think there is something which allows um a gestalt to to form and to
either slowly or rapidly come into focus rather than to have any step-by-step approach so instead
of thinking of arriving at a solution as the end stage of many steps if one thinks of arriving at a
a solution as the the coming into focus of an outer focus image and for some people this image can
collapse into a i use the word collapse almost advisedly because i think it is something like a
waveform making it a half moment there now we've got it we've got it that that is a a process that seems to
me on i think pretty good neurological evidence to be the way that the right hemisphere prefers to act
and so these two processes need one another but i think if one's over wedded to the left hemisphere's
way of thinking one actually disattends so i think we have faculties that by not using them we are allowing
to atrophy as is inevitably the case and that other other people and people with atypical brains are
able to achieve these things by not getting completely locked into the left hemisphere's preferred procedures
and you know the archetypal case must be einstein you know who was puzzling about something he wasn't
scribbling he was playing the piano or playing the violin and then he'd get up and go i've got it
it so i think and you can carry himself there's this story about the um fuchsian functions and
how he went into town and the very moment he put his foot on the bus to go home he realized what the
answer is having sweated over it in the logical kind of way for two weeks staying up at night with lots of
coffee yeah yeah so so this is you know i think i think this is a very important area for investigation
where if we if we and so so i hypothesize in that paper that basically because the solutions are
they're reaching out and and they're in fact they're you know i say positive pressure they they
want to sort of ingress into the physical world but but i also you know think that we could view them as
as agents as well that are that are like trying to they have they have that they're trying to meet so so
what makes you know what what is it that makes either certain um certain people or certain systems
or the right hemisphere um what distinguishes the cases where you're able to invite in this this this
this amazing pattern versus examples when you're not and you sort of have to slowly crawl crawl to it
you know what what what is right i mean that's that's kind of what what i'd like to know
well i mean come crashing down to neuro psychology of uh on on that one i mean all the the descriptions
involve a not knowing a letting go a potential space that can be filled and it's often said in you know
um in in eastern traditions that there is this idea of emptiness but but not emptiness in the western
sense which is of something negative it's emptiness which is the potential space into which something
rich and new can grow rather like a womb has to be empty to begin with in order that life can grow
so i think everybody um the scientists the artists the sages say that there is an important
period of fallowness in which one is not striving too hard but on the other hand you have to put
yourself in the way of it happening and so it may be necessary to do as wordsmith describe that you have
to strive you have to read you have to think you have to approach the problem and you know you won't
get it while you're doing that but you won't get it unless you've done that and then you drop it
and then the answer comes now why why that should be it seems to me the the most logical way to think
about that is that the right hemisphere has extremely wide um ranging um connective parts and it has a
greater facility for making distant connections than the left hemisphere and when the more one engages
the left hemisphere the more these connections become tightened down into almost like a concentric
into an area where you're focusing your attention so that it may be that what what's happening is that
you need to sort of do that and let it go i mean it might even be like exercises one can do physically
in order to relax which are to tense one's muscles and then actively let go of the tension and that
allows something to does this make any sense or am i just completely way way way away no no it makes it
makes it makes total sense um yeah i i think i think that's uh you know i think it's particularly
interesting uh down at the lower levels where we can say you've got you've got particles and molecules
that uh they don't they're not confused about what to do they they don't make mistakes the chemistry just
does what it does and it chooses the lowest path every single time and it's and it's great then then you
have a paramecium and the paramecium is now in the same bind as we are it has it it has to make
decisions rapidly with limited information um it can misperceive it can make mistakes all kinds of
things that that layer in between right what what happens you know how do you how do you how do you
you know how do you get to that level because because we can see all the you know in these very
simple life forms we can see all the molecular events happening and even you know some of the
things that we're doing in between like we've we've found the learning capacities in molecular
networks and so what i'm really interested in is is is is formulating a notion of this of search of of of
of um of striving of navigation in the molecular networks because we have to you know we have to
have pictures of it all the way down and i think it will be very simple but i you know i don't think
it's crazy to think about problem solving you know we know that happens in cells i don't think it's
crazy to think about it in molecular networks and all of the things that we think of as creative
you know um a creative search for problems and preparing yourself to to sort of um i you know i don't
know i'll be be um in resonance with this with this download of of information that is trying to
get to you if you you know i i think there's a molecular of the story to tell about this that
that i would like to do and it also i think it also links to some of these ideas of um the mind as
a filter you know it's an old idea and and right and you know and for very much my idea too yeah yeah
yeah right so so there's a there's an element of this where the more computational capacity you have
in a certain in a certain sense it's actually uh preventing you right from from from finding
certain things absolutely but of course the negation i mean another point i think is very
rich is that in our world we think of negation as well negative whereas in fact negation is highly
creative and you know an example is you know michelangelo creating a sculpture he doesn't put
anything together all he does for several years is throw stone away and at the end of it it's there
so there is something and for him there must be something calling to him in the stone that enabled
him to do this to find it if you like and so what are your speculations about how this might work at
the molecular level have you got any thoughts at this stage yeah i think i think this well well
there's a couple of things one there's a rich um uh set of uh findings coming from uh from from um
uh uh mesoscale physics and then solid state physics where there's actually there's actually
some amazing papers showing how when you when you vibrate a medium a particular way things that
things that uh belong together in the sense that um you know they're going to bind nicely to each other
actually when you watch the paths they actually sort of are like navigating it it doesn't look
random anymore but but there was you know nobody's guiding it there is at least overtly there's no
there's no algorithm or there's no mechanism for it so there's some stuff coming from from from
from physics around that um for me i i think we really need to think about these issues of to take
seriously this idea that that basically what's happening is that there are various kinds of patterns
some of these low agency things that mathematicians deal with the fact about the prime numbers and
such and then but but other of these patterns are the kinds of things that um patrick grimm was
looking at or beyond that we would recognize as kinds of minds or behavioral propensities or things
like this and that's some of the you know some of these i mean this is this is part of that discussion
about machines versus organisms and all that because i'm completely okay with uh acknowledging
we have to acknowledge that there are the things we call organisms are a completely different type of
pattern than the things we call simple machines there's obviously they're different but i think
we drastically underestimate the the material and the level of complexity that you need for that to
start to happen you know we've been investigating this as you know in the sorting algorithms and some
other crazy stuff that isn't published yet because we're still getting data but there's going to be
some some wild things coming down down the pike on this where we're basically i you know i i just think that
we have to be humble about the fact that um we do we are not good at predicting what kinds of simple
things are going to uh serve as pointers to some very sophisticated patterns and therefore we have
to be really careful before we label things as as just machines and so on that's you know we just we
just don't know and and i think i think figuring out that that relationship between the thing you build
whether it's a physical object whether it's an embryo a biobot uh you know a computer whatever the things
we build and the things that it that that it pulls down because it pulls down things that you did not
expect or or or in fact you know make provision for yeah i mean that would come on to the question of
ethics which you raised and i think is important but we can we can come back to that but i don't see
any reason why if there are not just if you like forms these non apparently non-physical forms that
ingress into phenomenological experience and cause changes in physical bodies um but also
i mean i'm interested in increasingly uh in the idea of goals and values as being
very real parts of the structure of the universe and i think that one way to look at i mean it's
interesting because science has um quite uh legitimately and very productively um stated that
it is going to explore things without reference to uh direction uh purpose or values and and
that's very useful and you know that's been been very important but what science cannot say at the
end of the day is that it has discovered there is no purpose and there is no values because it ruled
them out and it had no competence to find them if you like but if one gets beyond that there is nothing
um anti-scientific it is complementary to science that science sees a world that does have directions
and is lured by certain values and i think those values are and you find them very much in the stories
of mathematicians coming to their conclusions that there is something beautiful in them that they are
beautiful and complex and that generally speaking the universe has a tendency to produce things that
are beautiful and complex i mean one of the one of the things that i forgive me if i'm repeating myself
but i i often think along with whitehead who is an influence on me very much and you know why why is
their life at all and because if it's all about being able to remain in existence and and and beat
other things that remaining in existence then the answer is never to have been alive because you can
live for billions of years as a mountain but once you start really being alive your lifespan is is
limited but not necessarily that limited because there are these actin of bacteria in the base of
the ocean that are single examples of which are about a million years old so evolution has not actually
its purpose doesn't seem to have been able being that of making a single organism last for longer
it's been you know to end up with people like us that stick around for 70 years or so
so what is it about and i think what it is about is
is this drive towards complexity towards responsiveness towards the resonance with whatever
the source of energy that grounds everything manifests there's a resonance between us and it i mean
i'm positing that everybody imagines there must be something that grounds being we may not ever know
what it is and we may have to say well we just leave it at that but whatever that is it doesn't seem
to be entirely neutral because the universe that it has grounded is not just a random set of things
bumping into one another it has order it has beauty it has complexity and i think these are drives and i
think that what life offers is if you like that inter interdependence i was talking about before
in which in which there is um a kind of dance for want of a better word between that ground of being
and the living in which the potential that is stored there that is manifest in this explosive universe
is is being realized in certain ways so that it can can actually
bring something about that reflects something back to the origin the ground of being now the reason why
i think that is important is that i see that potential is extremely important and is often
thought of as less important than actuality and here i'm with forgive me heidegger who who said that
it's quite possible that potential is more important than actuality now yes and no but the potential
is no good unless anything gets actualized i mean an example i give of that is money you know money is
potential there it is and actually it's nothing until it's actualized it is the potential for all kinds
of beautiful experiences and things to be made and happen but it has to be spent in order that those
things can come about so the amount of potential diminishes the sort of free potential diminishes
and becomes an actuated part of experience now i may be misunderstanding whitehead but i think that is
his terminology is an off-putting element for me but i think that is what he's actually talking about
is that when things come into being they then add to the sum of what that is so that when new things
uh evolve from this field of potential those actualities have enriched it and they become more
likely to be expressed the next time around and so i think this explains the continuity and the
persistence of certain forms not the rigid insistence on those forms the general persistence of those forms
over time that they have been they've been precipitated out of potential into actuality and they now
change the nature of the universe ever so slightly if they're small things but nonetheless they do and
that what we are seeing is the unfolding of potential into actuality all the time
what do you think yeah yeah yeah yeah and this and especially um so i've been i've been playing with
models in which would be uh so so if we if we assume that um that there is a set of uh that is a set of
patterns of widely differing complexity and agency that are trying to get into the physical world
then one of the things that happens with evolution could be you could you could you could
easily have this uh positive feedback loop where when when evolution right it benefits from access to
these free lunches you know there's many many useful things you get that you don't need to
specifically evolve because of the these laws of mathematics and computation that just kind of are there for
you the minute you you know you make a voltage gated ion channel and and boom now you have truth
tables and you know all this amazing stuff because they're basically transistors and you don't have to
evolve a truth table you just you just have to make the you know make the protein and and so but but
but the feedback loop comes because as much as you take advantage of those kinds of free lunches
that enables you to build a more sophisticated interface meaning a better a better embodiment which
immediately gives you access to to other other more more sophisticated forms which then immediately
makes you enables you to make another more sophisticated embodiment and so it's like um it's
it's as you said it's a co-creation or a co-evolution of right of of these things that are um
kind of potentiating uh each each other yeah you know no fascinating and i suppose
you know come back to the machines thing it seems to me that if these forms exist and there seems to
be very little little way of accounting for things unless one accepts that something of this kind is the
case and and if they do have um values and direction purpose then why would they not
not for good or ill get instantiated in machines why it would it be unreasonable to suppose that you
know a highly complex ai did not actually itself express certain values and directions and as you say
we might get some surprises because we don't know exactly what we're doing there and so i mean it's not
a reason to to sort of be a luddite but it is a reason to be quite careful about what it is
you know to be aware of what it is we don't know i mean effectively that is the most important thing
for any scientist to be aware of is what it is he doesn't know not just what he does know exactly
and it's funny the the both ends of in my experience both ends of the uh opinion spectrum uh are finding
it very hard to appreciate that point because you have the people who actually make the things and
they say i've had people say to me well i build these ais i know what they do it's just linear algebra
i said well well you're just biochemistry aren't you like like yes of course but you you make them
but if you know you don't know what they do if you don't know what bubble sword is doing then then you
sure as heck don't know what what this thing is doing and and then there's the opposite side i had a
i had the organicists uh who are extremely interested in a very um uh kind of a a sharp uh distinction
right between these things i i gave i gave a talk to um to a group that was like in the kind of
indica philosophy traditions right and they were i i i thought i thought that that some of these
things that i was saying would be right up their alley in terms of these impressions that basically
come to haunt physical bodies and so on uh they were they were they were adamant that um no kind of
ai could be it could you could have any of this because it was as they called the dead matter and i said
well first of all first of all i'm not i don't think there is any dead matter there there are you
know lazy observers but i'm not sure there are any there is any actually dead matter but also you
know given given given the overall world view that you have these this this non-physical mind that
that uh you know is is is somehow um embodied and physical but who are you to say that that that if
you build a beautiful um you know synthetic embodiment some some mind it might not be remotely close to a
human mind it might be some very in fact i probably it'll be from some very uh weird untapped region of
space of minds who are you to say that this thing is not allowed to come you know to come in and and
sort of uh you know animate this uh in a certain sense this this novel embodiment i mean how what
you know on what basis but they were just completely uh adamant about that that wasn't going to happen
you know yeah i mean i think one can't be adamant about anything in this area one has to
keep a relatively open mind and be aware of what that that means so um but yeah it is it is an
interesting point um anyway yeah you said somewhere something i'd like you to expand on i wrote it down
i'll see if i can find it um yeah um
yeah you say the mechanisms by which these anatomical pattern memories are stored recalled
and implemented have been described and i wondered if you could tell me more about that i mean where are
these anatomical pattern memories stored recalled and implemented yeah um i i i i i will tell you
but uh but uh it is not the same as the the additional question of uh where they come from in
the first place and that's that's no good that's a whole other that's a whole other thing yes and i
can see you were you were separating those questions yeah well there's right i think i think there's
yes i think there's separate questions the the the the conventional side of this story is that
we can now see both as a matter of biology biology experiments and also computational modeling how
circuits made up of um biorealistic uh champ elements meaning ion channels and gap junctions so so
these electrical circuits they basically make a uh an excitable medium and this excitable medium can
ha can support as long as it's alive and there's um there's energy to do so they can support a number
of stable uh modes and you can think about this it's like touring patterns and in mixed chemicals it's
like basically um when you create the network it will spontaneously and i think evolution does a very
good job of of fine-tuning the channels that by default when you when the system is up and running
basically embryonic development uh it settles on a reliable pattern and you can see this pattern and
what the when i say pattern i mean it's a distribution of voltage gradients across a set of
cells it's not a single cell thing but let's say you have you know a thousand by a thousand cells
it's a patch of tissue and if you look you can actually see okay well there's a there's a you
know the electric face is that we that we found this one one example of this where where you have
this thing and it's spontaneously uh and we've now um generated a bunch of computation models that show
how exactly this happens it basically settles from uh from from a homogenous state it it it settles
into a state where it's got two spots is where the eye is going to be it's got a spot where the mouth
is going to be it's got some stuff around the outside for the placodes and and and that that thing
that thing is is stored in and um maintained within the electrical state of the cells and it's good
and it's compatible with the biophysical properties of the channels and then it is read out by other
cells which are basically paying attention to this pattern and and using it to determine what genes should
i express where should i migrate what should i differentiate into and and we know these things
are instructive because if i recreate that pattern somewhere else this is how you get an eye on the tail
or an extra leg or a you know you know repair brain defects and things like that so the the maintenance
and the readout of these things are now i mean we've been at it for 25 but but but that that we have
now a handle on um but but yes but then of course there's the other thing which is that for example in
planaria heads so they all have different shapes there's triangular ones flat ones when you perturb and
they're extremely robust so we know that a set of genetically um encoded um hardware elements
spontaneously will settle on one attractor for head shape and it works very reliably but we also know
that if you perturb that electrical decision making process they will just as happily visit head shapes
attractors in the space for other species and so now so you will work on that yeah yeah so so now we
have to ask the question right so so this is my point about mapping up that's that mapping out that
space we have to now understand how many attractors why these and not others are there is it um and
actually i was gonna i wanted to ask you about this too um what you whether you thought the space was
um sparse or um or or just the continuously filled in other words you know there's michelangelo's uh
statue that was calling to him around that are there an infinite number of almost as good statues or
really like there are like i don't you know i don't know not surprisingly i don't know either
yeah yeah okay we had a couple of thoughts about that i mean presumably going to the question but
how does that pattern you've suggested that there is a pattern and you can see that there's a place
for the eyes and so on but how does that pattern arise is that going too close to the other question
and we don't know where these things come from no well how we we know how so if you want to track
basically we can track and computationally predict all the step from zero in other words you start with
much like touring did this is one i think i think one of his genius things is that he was interested in
in uh intelligence but also in the self-assembly of the body right and i think he saw that these were the
same problem and and and in touring patterns it's kind of similar you start with a well-mixed
random uh field of chemicals and before you know what you've got some tiger stripes or some leopard
spots or some things like this and and there's a precise mathematical um uh formalism that shows
you exactly why that happens the same thing is true here except it's in the it's in it's an electrical
um but you know actually um who was it uh i forget who it was but somebody somebody pointed out that
actually the form of the map for um hodgkin huxley and um and some of the um uh some of the uh
original touring diffusion stuff is actually very parallel but but regardless we we have the model
showing when you start with a field where all the voltages are basically equal given the properties
of the channels uh spontaneous symmetry breaking and amplification will give you certain kinds of
patterns and some of them are the kinds of things that that we're interested in such as face and and
so on and you can and you can watch this happen step by step i mean the the the that the how of it
is much like with turing patterns is it's okay you know now but but but but the part where we now have
to understand what what the available modes are and and uh and what the bi-directional interaction is
that i that i think pulled some of these um you know planaria and other things into these attractors
that's that that's that's a whole other thing and there are some other fascinating things that are
wrong not not understood but but the how of it at least we've got now yeah that that's what i was
thinking is that that describes the how but it doesn't describe the why of the thing being like
that at all um or at least so it seems to me well the why i mean this is this is exactly when we get
into yeah i i think we need to know what what we would accept as a proper answer to the question of
why because because you know uh this is where we get into those those those for example those fractal
shapes right the why of any piece of mathematical truth is so so why is it like that as a but because
there isn't the fact of physics that's going to give you an answer there isn't a fact of history
meaning right there's no evolutionary or what else what what are the other tools in our toolbox for
answering why questions that's that's that now we're now we're getting into an area where i don't
even know what a good answer to that would be well there might be an answer of the kind that um
the reason that the the the tadpole's head reconfigures completely as a frog's head
and we can explain some of the step by step of how that happens i'm sure i mean it's just a matter of
not just but it's a matter of very clever observation but it is a matter of observation whereas
where the where the information the information of the the having to go from the one head to
double where is that and why does it why does it in in here or or ingress in the way that it does
it seems to me another kind of question that's all good it it is and one of the reasons why i started
talking about this i mean i've been interested in this stuff for for decades but but the reason i started
talking about it more recently where i never talked about this before is that i think we now
have even more uh practical tools to start addressing some of these questions and for example
what what i'm you know what i'm really interested in are the unexpected uh patterns that manifest in
synthetic uh synthetic bodies that have never been the the target of selection specifically such as
anthrobots xenobots these weird chimeras that we make right yes yes because because because we can talk
about you know people who want to have a very kind of um uh minimal ontology they don't want this a
platonic space they say look the when you say forms these are just stable uh evolutionary these are
these are things that evolution has has learned over time this is a good way to make a frog this is
not a good way to make a frog and that's that's all there is to it and so so i'm interested now in
all of these examples where that there is no history of selection to lean on these things never existed
before there's never been any pressure to be a good xenobot or a good anthrobot or any of this other
stuff and and being able to predict and uh make use of these things for for medicine for for
biorobotics and whatever requires that we give up this this magical notion of emergence as well it's
just a fact that holds about the world we'll catalog them you know as they come up right and and commit
to some sort of systematic investigation of what what are the patterns in addition to the ones that
evolution has found what what what are these patterns can we can can we find them can we right
and can we make new is that um that that will down the ones we want and by the way avoid the ones
don't want which i'm sure i don't want yeah yeah well it's a it's an overlay do you think that
there's a worry in it i i do think there's a worry in it uh because i think we are now in many ways
and i think we have been for a long time which is not good at recognizing it um we're we're
dipping into a pool of patterns that maybe have never been uh we've never exactly maybe certainly
not on earth maybe maybe nowhere have have ever been involved before and no there are there are
dangers in it uh on on both ends there's the obvious thing that people talk about which which
is you know what is it going to do to us right that's one set of things but but but equally important
is the question um what what uh what is its experience going to be what do we owe you know
novel beings that you know novel minds right that we're bringing into the world this is this is the
perennial question it is it is yeah yeah no no very good what would you have to say about the planarial
head having the ability to solve a maze so you can see this form of the head and you can change the
form of the head but where are its memories do you mean do you mean um oh oh behave you mean behavioral
behavioral memories so so you know you know that if a planarian has solved a maze or even a
slime mold has solved the maze and you cut bits off it the the daughters can uh you can destroy burn the
head of the planarium and and the new head will know how to solve the maze have you thoughts about that
how that comes about yeah yeah good point so so so yeah so mcconnell found um this this uh uh memory
surviving regeneration of the brain back in the 60s we actually show this using modern techniques in 2013
so we built a we built an automated device that um uh completely automates the training and testing of
planaria in that in that assay which was important because mcconnell would get like his his um uh experiments
you have to you have to manually someone would sit there with a pencil and say oh i saw this thing
turn right versus left and they would write it down and then people say well you're just you know you're
just imagining things and so and so we made a device it's this it's this giant thing that automates the
process so we have videos now so you can you know that you can't you can't uh you know say it's an
observer but you know affect anymore so and and it does work um he was right and uh uh i think i think
there's a couple of things we can say one is that one of the things this is showing is that memories can
be i i they can it's like a um i i think there are two kinds of uh pointers that two two patterns to
that point these patterns there is that and maybe this maps onto your potentiality versus actuality thing
there are some pointers that are right now um uh connecting us to that pattern and this might be an
existing an existing body it might be an engram in the brain whatever mechanism different people study
different mechanisms right those are things that are that are guiding behavior right now but i think
what's happening in those planaria is that in that uh eight to ten days during which they're regrowing
their brain during which time they have no behavior there's nothing going the tail just sits there
doing doing nothing during that time they they still have access to to that information and we
know this because because the cells have to somehow um well i used to describe it as the cells having to
imprint it onto the new brain because because that's when the behavior is really going to get going is
once the brain is there so so it had to have right the way i used to describe it is that it's it's the
information is moving through the body the cells are storing it they're imprinting it on the new brain
so so now i think uh more more like what it is is that we can i think we can say that behavioral
memories are patterns in that space just like morphological memories and that the engrams in
the brain are pointers to that information and that the rest of the cells are in some way placeholding
it such that when such that when the brain is going to show up it'll facilitate it to reconnect
to the to the patterns that it had before and we actually have lots of data on moving moving
different kinds of memories both anatomical and behavioral into bodies by transplants and one of
the one of the things is that it takes very little tissue to um to to put in a new a new a new pattern
into into a large uh recipient organism it's it really doesn't take very much at all and one of this
this is still unpublished but but we have we have some work showing that if you cut a tiny little
piece out of a two-headed worm and you stick it into a one-headed worm not not every time but but
some percentage of the time that little piece convinces all the other cells which this is what's
mind-boggling why are they you know why are they going along with this they should be they should be
suppressing this this aberrant you know this aberrant but sometimes that that that story of of being two
headed is really compelling and and it and it takes over the you know the recipient worm and you get two
headed worms which never saw the gap junction blocker that the you know the it's it's it transfers
over and um yeah and so there's some there's some clinical cases which you may have seen that that
are a little bit like that of um of some some personality changes coming along with things like
stem cell transplants and hard lungs you know exactly you know i don't know fascinating yeah
it's super fascinating i don't know if the if the if the data set is big enough to make firm
conclusions yet but but i think it's very interesting um yeah so so that's my that's
my suspicion on this is that is that i think i think these memories are patterns just like just
like the morphological patterns and i'm sure you're right to point outside of the the the mere bounds of
the brain that these things can be stored as you say in heart lung other places quite how or what it is
that's stored i don't know but the the literature seems certainly not dismissible on on these these
changes that happen what do you think of um hydran encephalic individuals who i mean just for for
viewers or listeners this is not just um hydrocephalus where a lot of the brain space is filled with fluid and
it's extraordinary that there you you get people with very little brain compared to most people
who nonetheless function normally and have a perhaps high iq and can do mathematics to a high level but
with hydran encephalic individuals there aren't that many of them that survive but they have
nothing in the brain space so basically they stop at the brain stem and vestigial or no cerebral tissue
and yet they can they can in some form see things they can interact with people in an emotionally
intelligent way they can have favorite toys they can appreciate music how the hell is this happening
what is going on have you any thoughts about that yeah yeah it's this this is a real problem and uh um
karina kaufman i just just put out a review of some of that kind of stuff um uh some of the
okay some of the famous cases uh to me the problem is so so i i've i i'm not uh i'm not super super
shocked that it's possible just be in in the sense that you know i've already committed to this idea
that a lot of the the processing as it were happens offline you know outside the physical environment so
it's okay so that's fine yeah but but what is a problem and what i don't have a good explanation for is
is if if it is apparently possible to have proper function without as much brain as as as we think
right if it's if if if if one can access all that stuff with with with much reduced um architecture
why is that not more i mean you know my understanding is that one thing that limits our
are you know the there's pressure on not having a brain that's too big because of childbirth and all
this kind of stuff and and the brain eats up a tremendous amount of our our daily energy rations
why if it's possible to do with less why don't we with less you know that's the right is that right
these examples are showing you that that it can be done with a lot less why it can be done but i mean
of course these are not uh by contrast with with hydrocephalic subjects these are not really fully
functioning human beings this is true i was yeah i guess i was talking more about the hydrocephalic
ones where where where even they don't you know some of them don't even know there's an issue until
they have a head scan they do a scan and oh my god you know so so right so i just right in that case
those cases are are to me very um weird i don't understand why you know why why if if that's possible
why isn't it just that all the time you know yeah yeah yeah yeah i i don't know i don't know no no
you you must tell me when you've got to go uh mike but um if you've got time i'd just like to put
an idea to you please please yeah keep going oh okay good um one way of thinking about this potential
versus actual thing is um even more fundamental which is goethe's i think extraordinary insight
that he said dividing the united uniting the divided is the whole business of nature and then he goes on
to talk about things in other metaphors but i think the point is there that the whole business of nature is
dividing what is united and then uniting what has been divided now to me that is also a phenomenal
echo of the right versus left thing because the right hemisphere sees something as a whole the left
hemisphere takes it to pieces analyzes it which literally means breaking it up and then the right
hemisphere takes back what has been analyzed and recomposes it into a now enriched whole
whole so that is a an important um journey from wholeness to a divided wholeness back to an increased
integrity of wholeness and i suspect that this is actually part of the way that creation in general
happens now if you think about the potential and the actual what is happening there is that the potential
is collapsed into the actual and it has very specific pin pinnable downable qualities but those qualities
having been created in that way are present in a way they never were before so they now get taken back
into the whole in a way that enriches the whole now the reason i'm i'm saying this is that
it seems to me that when we talk about the being forms and and in my case i'm not including you
unless you want to be included in the idea that there are drives purposes directions to evolution not
just biological evolution but the evolution of the cosmos in general and if that is the case
and it may well be that there are analogues of the force for division and the force for union
at very very low levels so going down to single cells not just uh reproduction of course but and
the whole process is interesting in reproduction where i think where the the dance of the chromosomes
where they get divided and recompose in a new form but actually the whole business of
the drives that are for good or ill part of of life can be seen i mean it's a step it's a large
step and it may be a step too far i'm perfectly happy to be told that but it seems to me that there
might be some value in reflecting on that as being of resonating with or actually being present at
different levels in the cosmos both the living cosmos and perhaps the the non-living i don't know
if you have any immediate reactions to that other than oh wow he's gone into some completely crazy space
no i don't think that's crazy at all because this is something we think about a lot in terms of uh
uh how um how collectives form and what happens when when parts join to be a to be a collective
and how uh and and and uh which in in our case oftentimes this is a is a pathology we try to deal
with when there are when there are breakdowns and things are sort of breaking up but but that actually
that that that cycling back and forth and and probably it does go all the way down is i i think i think
i think very interesting we you know we came across this um um um a student that i work with
was doing this model of uh it's um this this will be up uh on on online shortly um uh iterated prisoners
dilemma that is spatialized so so you have a bunch of agents they're all playing they're all playing
prisoners dilemma against each other right but but there's a but there's a twist here uh normally in
all of the analyses that that we have ever seen the number of agents is fixed so you know how many
beings there are they all play against each other there's a payoff table and and then off you go and
then there's things that happen so so we added two things we added yes you can cooperate or defect but
you can also merge and split so what that means is that is that two eight might become one and then
the whole calculus immediately changes so what happens is it's this it's this recursive thing where
your decisions change how many individuals there are and it changes the border between you and the
world right so multi-cellular particularly you can but but strange things start to happen because
because now your choices determine the number of beings in the world which completely changes the
calculus both for you and your parts and everything so so all the math that normally go that goes along
with it doesn't work anymore because because because you know it's it's it's it's all recursive right
so anyway um uh so so there's interesting stuff that happens but one of the things that happens is that
eventually uh you get bigger and bigger regions and eventually you come to a to a position and and i
didn't understand i didn't foresee this at you know at the beginning and and it took us some time to
figure out what was happening what we noticed is that eventually so so the the the um uh the energy
level of these things goes up and up and up as they get bigger and bigger so that's great so we can
see there's a drive towards multi-cellularity fine but then it sort of reaches a cliff and falls off and
we said what the what the heck is this and we figured out what was happening what happened this
when these guys merge to the point where there's one one big agent there's no one for him to play
with there's no one to play against and so now it's kind of like asking what's the fitness of the
entire biosphere to find because there's no one to there's no one to get that you know right and so
and so now you can imagine we imagine three scenarios that that can happen after that the first scenario
and and they roughly kind of match i think um uh the the the scenarios that have been envisioned for
the universe for the end of the universe so one thing is a kind of a heat death where look you've
gotten to your world you've eaten all the food that's it now everything dies there's nothing more
to do that's that's that's that's one thing to do but another thing to do that's interesting is this
as you get big and your energy level starts to drop because there are no more games to benefit from
one of the things that happens is stress stress builds up and when stress builds up you you you
fragment kind of like trauma causing a dissociative state right you fragment into pieces as soon as
you fragmented it into pieces you can start to climb back again because now now so right so now there's
this big bag big bang big crunch thing where you sort of you you start off as individuals you join
together into this thing you fragment back and you come and you sort of can impulse right yeah back and
forth so so so you could do that and then there's a third version which which uh we haven't implemented
yet which is this maybe what happens is that once you do this and you've and you've you've you've joined
together um maybe what it allows you to do is now project yourself into a new space that was not
accessible to you before so in biology we know this happens because individual cells that are navigating
physiological and transcriptional spaces they get together and now i anatomical morphous space now we can now we
can we can do all these things we couldn't do before right so maybe they can escape the now in our
system there was no way for them to escape the world because we coded it that way right but but
but if we if we were smarter we would have multiple layers where this thing can now escape the universe
that it has sort of explored to the edges and and right and go for so i don't know but but but but
i think what about this this this kind of like basal um you know joining and and splitting is is is
fundamental and and i remember i i i remember um uh uh bernardo castrop and rupert spears saying
on one of their on one of their um talks that he he they they thought that we we are all how do you
put it we are all dissociative altars of god that's what he that's what he said that we are basically
you know kind of like this dissociative thing and and trying to sort of work our way back right that's
what so that's how they put it um i love all of that um very very resonant with my own thinking and
although i wouldn't say that we're all i know that what they mean dissociated alters of god but i think
the point is this that that you know in in every creation myth there is the idea of this founding
being the ground of being and it needs an other first of all because it is relational like all existence
it is relational so it has to have something to relate to and also the otherness is creative
so the otherness which seems like resistance or negation of the wholeness and beauty of the original
is also the the path from which the manifest latent beauty and complexity can be unpacked
so it's part of the creative process it's really a very fine idea and i i you know so this is probably
not what you you you you normally talk about on on podcasts but i'm i came across the um the extraordinary
wisdom of the the kabbalah the the the the jewish uh you know mystical uh tradition and in the
lurianic kabbalah there is this primal being called n soft which is the ground of being and um
it wants to create as all these beings do and so it its first act is negation of itself so the first
act is to withdraw in order to make space for there to be something other than in stuff at all which is
an extraordinarily imaginative idea that actually needs to be the negation to be creative and then
in the space that is now vacant there are placed the um these urns which are to be the sephirot and
the the one spark of light comes or spark of fire i should say it comes out of and so and falls on the
vessels and shatters most of them and so that's the second phase of creation called the chef of that
hergelian the shattering of the vessels and then there comes this third phase tikkun which is that
it's humanity's job to take back these fragments that now have sparks of divine fire in them and put
them together to make urns that are more beautiful and more special and living where they have divine
life in them than the original urns had so that again is slightly like again this progression from the
left to the right to the left and the incorporation of this new element that may seem like it's a
negation or a breaking or whatever makes something even more whole and more beautiful than was before
i mean i just put it forward because i think it's intuitive i think these really profound images and
myths are not just you know nothing they are ways in which we our minds contact the shapes the forms if
you like and see something that means something not because we add meaning but because we find the
meaning that is there yeah anyway that's what i'd say do you do you think that um is is it a prediction
of this view that with the wide potential variety of beings out there in the universe that we are going
to find some sort of i don't know if it would have to be physically bilaterally you know sort of organized
but but but that they would have to necessarily contain some component that is that is like the
left hemisphere in its job and some component right like is this is this a general architecture do you
think i i would you know of course uh it's a mug's game predicting things about which one has no
information but but nonetheless i mean that would be my that would be my supposition that this is so
fundamental to the structure of everything um living and non-living that it yes it would have
to be reflected in some way and that quite probably things like goodness beauty and truth would also be
elements that are in this story and there could be good and evil there could be beauty and ugliness
it could be truth and falsehood there we are yeah so so i'll just i'll just say this this gives me an
interesting idea which i probably should have realized before that um you know we have now the
ability to collect uh calcium signaling data from uh from xenobots and soon from anthrobots i i i i'm
going to start looking for a lateralization of uh a function i wonder if in these things which and by
the way we have neurobots now that um uh that have neurons that we put neurons into these things that
have that they don't have a standard architecture they have some kind of crazy novel architecture but but
but maybe maybe we can find examples of this of of of of processing that's associated with
integration versus uh you know versus reductive analysis i let's uh we'll take a look i think that
would be really fascinating i i can't wait to hear what you find and what i love about your work is that
you have for a very long time um not dismissed the idea that asymmetry is extremely important as well as
that there needs to be something beyond the simply mechanistic vision so thank you very much for your
time and your wisdom thank you so much likewise yeah this has been this has been amazing i took a
bunch of notes actually as we were talking so um thank you it's a very okay so yeah so i'll keep you
apprised there was some stuff coming that that should be quite relevant to this so i'll keep you apprised
that that's fabulous thank you very much mike thanks will you will you send the will you send the the
tape to my people yeah thanks very much yeah okay thank you you you know how old i am i know i know
okay i say it all the time too yeah from the tape all right thank you very much we'll see you
