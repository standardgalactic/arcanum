giving an artist who wants to sell their books in a world of five publishers extra copyright
is like giving your bullied kid extra lunch money right that doesn't matter how much
lunch money you give that kid that kid is not getting lunch
and we are here today with corey doctorow who is the author along with rebecca giblin who is a law
professor at the university of melbourne of a fantastic recent book choke point capitalism which
is a a kind of a a wide-ranging traversal of all the things that have gone wrong in the creative world
through concentration of ownership and abuses of power at the mega corporate level now corey is
joining us for the second time he is a prolific polymathic if that's a word writer of science
fiction non-fiction children's books he's a blogger a champion for what i like to think of as digital
human rights a visiting professor of computer science at the open university and one of the
key contributors to the open rights group and the founder of the electronic frontier foundation
and about a gazillion other things um and you can and should read him almost every day on pluralistic
dot net and to put the cherry on the on the sunday he's also a canadian so right welcome macquarie
well thank you um i should note i am the co-founder of the open rights group and an and a 20-year
uh association with the with the electronic frontier foundation just just uh you got those slightly
backwards but that's fine yeah well that that just don't want to steal any valor
let's talk a little bit about about choke point capitalism which um uh despite the title is not
a book about tearing down our entire economic system or at least not overtly it's not by professor richard
wolf uh or some other notable marxist it's really about the arts and the creative professions and how
they've been affected by the concentration of ownership throughout the um the world by which we access
the arts um so it's not really about miners and industrial laborers etc although i suppose a lot of
the principles could be extrapolated and um what i'd like to do is um because not all of us are digital
natives the way you are and because the book covers such a wide range of variations on the theme of how
power is abused um i'd like to to try to look at it from the two perspectives which really are the two
ends separated by the choke points that is the artists and the audiences we we the beneficiary of the
work of artists um it's really a story about um how the platforms that kind of dominate the arts world
um create these um choke points and in some ways it's a very old story monopoly um harming the interests
of workers through abuse of power monopsony the um uh concentration of places to sell your work
um and uh the impacts on the the consumer um so how do you and rebecca actually define choke point cap
capitalism when it comes to the creative fields sure before i answer that i want to just slightly dispute
the characterization of the book because you're right that it is uh uh i think a rather skillful and lucid
dissection of what amounts to some very baroque accounting frauds by very large firms that were
down to the detriment of creative workers but that's the first half of the book and the second half of
the book which i'm sure we'll get to but i want to be clear here the second half of this book is actually
what to do about it they're detailed technical shovel ready policy prescriptions that in just in
case you've just tuned in and you're getting the impression that this is one of those chapter 11 books
where there's 10 chapters about how bad everything is an 11th chapter that just exhorts you to go
vote harder to fix it that's not what we're about we we are proposing systemic solutions not things you
can do individually because you're not going to shop your way out of monopoly capitalism anymore and you're
going to recycle your way out of climate change but but systemic things that that you know the next
time someone says something must be done these are some things that can be done so that's i just just
want to i know that might be pedantic or i might be getting ahead of your uh questions but i really
want to make that point clear in terms of what it is it is a bifurcated book and it does uh basically
rescue us all from a feeling of pervasive gloom and doom yes you know uh one of one of the things
that um i think is a real risk in dealing with um this kind of world is that we find ourselves in the
um the role doll world of matilda where you know arthur wormwood says to her i'm right you're wrong
i'm big you're small and there's nothing you can do about it right yeah yeah that kind of nihilistic
yeah council of despair i got no time for it i i'm an activist i i have hope if not optimism i think if we
materially improve our circumstances even in small ways that we might discover uh new courses of action
that were previously obscured that will improve our circumstances in larger ways and that um there's
no point in despair and the fact that you can't chart a clear path from a to z doesn't mean that
one exists it just means that life doesn't work like a novel where there's just a kind of clear path
through all the adversity of of neatly attained uh uh objectives that lead to a climax in a denouement
where everyone gets a medal from princess leia so that said uh right what's chokepoint capitalism choke
point capitalism is when firms uh that dominate their sector uh gather audiences for uh creative
work or more broadly customers for a product or service inside some kind of fortress so maybe they
have figured out how to coerce people into not leaving maybe they figured out how to tempt them
into not leaving maybe they have technological mechanisms that allow them to prevent third
parties from opening up the walled garden maybe they have legal arrangements that allow them to wield
the power of the state against people who would free the hostages they've taken but through some
means and we can dig into how those work and again they're very baroque scams but they're important
um through some means you get the audience locked up and so then you're a creator and you say you're
a writer there's five major publishers left in the world maybe you're a musician there's three major
record labels left in the world or or you might be a filmmaker with four major studios left in the world
or you know you you might want to uh do advertising supported media with two major ad brokers that control
nearly all the advertising and and to get through to that audience you have to accept whatever terms
these major firms are offering they have a choke point and they control it and the reason this
matters in respect of the creative industries in a way that is slightly different to the way that it
relates to other industries because like uber is a choke point industry people want to drive people
want rides uber sits in the middle and extracts rent from them does nothing um but but uh in there's one
thing that is very different here which is that the law anticipates that creators will be at a
negotiating disadvantage when they come to these intermediaries and it equips them with a tool
copyright that is meant to rebalance the negotiation but when there is market concentration in the arts
copyright is not only not useful to uh uh resolve these negotiating uh imbalances it's actually
counterproductive you know giving an artist who wants to sell their books in a world of five
publishers extra copyright is like giving your bullied kid extra lunch money right that doesn't
matter how much lunch money you give that kid that kid is not getting lunch and in fact the even if
the bullies like take some of the lunch money they've ripped off from all the kids and uses it to fund
like an ad campaign demanding extra lunch money for the hungry children of canada it's not going to feed
the kids and so we tend to take the interests of uh creative laborers and the intermediaries who
represent them as being somehow coterminal like you know we're writers and publishers have the same
interests or musicians and record labels or you know vloggers and youtube they don't they are in fact
class enemies and they have distinct and incompatible interests in in in profound ways that need to be
disentangled um and and that's what this book attempts to do right and uh i really take the point about
copyright because over the past 40 years we've seen copyright extended right the so-called sunny bono
bono copyright extension act which was basically the save mickey mouse from becoming public domain act
um the um you know extension of you know various kinds of of copyright um protections but ultimately
they read down to the benefit of you know record labels and publishers and and various other interests
and as uh one good friend of mine who is a composer has said you know they keep offering us like my
copyright will live you know 70 years after i'm dead how about paying me more while i'm alive
yeah that's an excellent point you know one of the things that we've seen and actually the impulse for
this book because rebecca and i have both been kind of mired on the copyright wars for 20 years
is that we gave this presentation in melbourne together and we're in the cab going to dinner
afterwards and we're talking about how there's just this stupid low quality debate where people are
told that they have to choose between like team content and team tech or you know team creator
and team user and that like these large firms it doesn't matter which one has got the whip hand
they're they're going to wield it identically and that for 40 years copyright has expanded as you say
it's not just that it's expanded in term it's expanded in scope it covers new works it's and new
kinds of works it's expanded in um uh terms of its statutory damages regime so here in the us
there's 150 000 in civil penalties and 250 000 in criminal penalties for um uh copyright infringement
without having to show any damages um and uh and and it's also gotten easier to prove copyright
infringement and it is indeed the case that over those years the entertainment sector has gotten
larger and more profitable but at the same time the share of the revenues from those profits that go to
creators both real terms and and proportionally has fallen and so you know i think that like
this demands a reckoning right if you if you find yourself at the bottom of a hole you got to stop
digging right let's let's try something else because it's not working yeah exactly and again just not to
harp too much on the extension of copyright term but you know those copyrights typically don't end up
you know in the uh with the the descendants of the creators they end up in the hands of large
corporations which means that you know given that they've got a revenue stream from innumerable works
that uh may last for you know decades and decades their incentive to invest in the development of new
talent is actually less because those investments are risky whereas proven earners that they can basically
sit on and clip the coupons for for the next 50 or 100 years um that's basically low risk money just
sit there and and uh and collect the rents so that's true and and it's and beyond that if you're a firm
that has gathered a bunch of these long live copyrights into your portfolio so there's three labels that
control 70 of all recorded music and they own the three publishers that control 60 of all compositions
um the passive income streams that uh come off of those uh um assets allow you to have uh advantages
durable advantages over new market entrance so a label that enters the system does not have this kind
of free cash flow arising from the this uh this this deep and and enduring portfolio and so they're fighting
naked right whereas you've got these like deep supply lines and so this is how the advantage that is
accumulated into these three firms hands um is accumulate still how they how they gain more power
one of the stories we tell in the book is how this power uh fused music and tech in the form of spotify
so you know there was this time when tech entered the sector both uh kind of through the front door and through the
back door so you had napster coming in through the back door and and then its successors napster actually
had a plan to pay musicians they just they went to the labels and they said like we surveyed our users
they'll pay 15 bucks a month for napster just tell us how much money you want we'll just give you billions
of dollars and the label said no we're suing you um but napster successors after that happened were like
screw it we're not going to pay anyone anything uh and so you had nutella and so on so so there was there
was that through the back door but then through the front door there were all of these new innovative
services that were popping up you know pandora and last fm and so on even youtube and they offered
superior terms to the terms that were being offered by the record labels which wasn't hard i mean the
beetles deal their initial deal had them splitting one penny per lp but not the whole penny only 85 of the
penny because 15 went to uh like breakage and marketing and then 10 of the remaining 85 of a
penny had to go to their uh manager and then they split the remaining penny uh four ways the remaining
the remaining fraction of a penny's four ways so it wasn't hard to offer better deals and actually
there were bidding wars where first of all the tech firms bid against each other they had access to
silicon valley venture capital they bid against each other to to lure in top acts and and other acts
and then the labels bid against the tech sector and so you know the the the royalty rose and rose
but you know as consolidation occurred in the tech sector and in the record sector they just stopped
competing this is you know an idea as old as the wealth of nations uh the adams smith says you know
seldom to men of the same trade gather but they they uh you know uh conspire to figure out how to
raise prices and screw their workers right i mean that's that's like just built in so along comes
spotify and spotify wants to go in through the front door they want to they want to license the
catalog obviously to license the catalog they have to make nice with these three giant companies sony bmg
sony umg and and um uh and and warner's water and and so the three labels make them an offer they
can't refuse they demand giant equity shares ownership stakes and spotify so now they have
this like irresolvable conflict of interest because as owners of spotify every dollar
that spotify sends to their suppliers eg record labels is a dollar they can't give to their
shareholders eg record labels there's a difference though if the record label gets a dollar in royalties
it has to give it to the musicians if it gets a dollar in dividends it doesn't have to to give it
to anyone except to shareholders it gets to decide it can give some of it to musicians all of it a
little bit you know it's it is always the case that in in every one of these instances you can find
entities that are getting giant amounts of money in the same way that if you go down to like the cne
uh at 10 in the morning you'll see someone walking around the midway who's one like a teddy bear as
big as themselves from that you know ring it ring a disc uh uh you know booth and the reason that the
carny has let them win the giant teddy bear is because they're going to walk around all day
convincing other people to try and throw the ball in the peach basket so you know there are some winners
here but not many of them um and and so you know they get to apportion this revenue as they choose so
the first thing they did spotify and the labels is they agreed that spotify would pay
just a shockingly low fraction of a penny scale royalty for every stream but that the labels would
get a guaranteed minimum payout so this is another great deal if you're the label because if you're
guaranteed 10 million dollars a month but the royalty rate per stream is so low that only five million
dollars of that is attributable to any particular artist then the other five million is unattributable
royalties you can use that straight in your pocket or you can you can buy a giant teddy bear for one
musician who will lure other musicians in and then put it straight in your pocket right you can do all
kinds of things with this anything you want uh it's yours it's off the books so um uh the second thing
they did though was negotiate what's called a most favored nation clause which is to say that spotify
could not pay any other label more money than the big three were getting but those companies didn't
were not entitled to minimum monthly spends free advertising inclusion on hot playlists all the
special goodies that that the labels uh negotiated for themselves with the company they co-owned spotify
which means that for the 30 of artists who are signed to labels that aren't the big three
their wages were artificially suppressed by this cozy arrangement now it could have changed because just
before spotify had its ipo the uh the standard deal uh expired and it was time to negotiate a new one
and if the labels were negotiating on behalf of their artists this would be the moment at which they
would go for the throat because the the the spotify can't have an ipo without the three labels on board
so they could hypothetically demand any royalty to up to the threshold where the company would just collapse
and spotify would have to pay it instead they cut their rate the reason they cut their rate is because
the cheaper spotify's inputs are the more the ipo would pop and the more those shares would be worth
and so uh here you have you know a baroque accounting scam and it gets worse you know like um
if you if you have a favorite band you know like um when i was a kid in toronto i used to listen to this
band uh uh that would play at larry's hideaway called parts found in c uh it was this like weird
little you know sort of proto goth band if you listen to parts found in c all day every day for
a month and give spotify 15 for the privilege parts found at speed c doesn't necessarily see a penny of it
because what what uh spotify is doing is adding up all of the streams that were listened to
for say sony remitting that money and then sony apportions it based on the total number of
streams listened to not based on uh what each subscriber paid to listen to which means that
parts found in c might never see any money from from uh spotify and so all of these broken baroque
scams just add up to the system where the record labels giant catalogs of uh of recorded music that
didn't expire for 70 years let them structure the future of the of the industry which let them
shift um uh the surpluses from uh their uh labor force to their shareholders and also let them
structure the way that other uh entities would do business as well so they we have in music effectively
a planned economy but it's not planned by a culture minister and it's not planned by a by a bureaucrat
it's planned by the people in the boardrooms at sony universal and warner's right and you've kind of
anticipated part of the direction i want to go in because one of the things that the book does quite
brilliantly is it looks at you know each of the major platforms or business areas um but i'd like to sort of
turn it around a little bit uh from the point of view of both the artist and the audience um because
you know the impacts kind of cut across the different platforms depending on which you are so
um i'm going to do a little a little role playing now um and um so i'm a young aspiring punk rocker
because what else would i be um of course and i write my own material and i want to record it and
get my songs published and i want to get other people to cover them and i want them to be heard
by as many people as possible and i might actually have some physical products because that still is
about 15 or 20 percent of the market and who can afford to throw away that um so there will be actual
cds and even lps um that can be sold over various wealth over the one and only platform um that's out
there and that will be a springboard to touring fame and success so that i can you know basically
keep myself in you know a lifetime supply of you know surgical metal piercings and so on uh so
how do these various choke points basically can not conspire but converge to screw me over
sure well i mean i think that at every level there's problems so for example your compositions
are going to be handled by a right society collecting society and each nation has its
own collecting society they don't share any infrastructure so each one hand codes all of the
uh um uh royalty all the people who are owed royalties in their own way um and often they
claim that they can't find obscure artists like beyonce to give them the money that they're owed many of
them uh also um when they don't uh when they have unattributable royalties they get to use them for like
development which can often mean like cushy staff retreats or bonuses or whatever they're not for
example required and this is one of our proposals they're not required to spend all unattributable
royalties on improving their systems for attributing royalties which is literally just the only thing
they should be spending that goddamn money on um and uh so that's you know that's at the at the kind
of blanket license side um you know the music you sell through amazon um is going to have its own
problems if you're selling physical discs through amazon so the um dc uh attorney general has just
brought a really interesting antitrust case against amazon that lays out a pretty damning fact pattern
about how amazon uh screws everybody so amazon uh likes to lock in its customers that's its kind of
special sauce so at first it locked them in by offering them really good deals it used its shareholder
capital to subsidize the price of delivery and subsidize the price of goods and sold both below cost
um now that uh many high street retailers have gone out of business and it's very hard to buy things
in the real world um it has ceased that subsidy um and instead it offers prime that's the big that's
the big uh uh come on with amazon so prime comes with all kinds of goodies and benefits but it also has
the um sort of psychological and economic effect of making it very unlikely that you'll shop anywhere
else prime prime customers in there about 80 of us households or prime customers um are uh likely
to start their search on amazon and if they find what they like uh that more than 95 of them don't
look anywhere else so amazon is the only place they buy so this is um this is a choke point right
they've corralled all the customers inside the prime corral and so sellers need to be on there
so like the people who are selling your cds to amazon need to be selling through amazon now amazon
will not list you on the front page of search unless you agree to fulfillment by prime which
means that you have to pay fees you also have to pay fees if you want to advertise to be at the top
of a search result if you don't other people will buy the name of your band as a search keyword and when
they search for your band you'll see their discs first and in fact you might go through two or three
screens of results before you see it so once you bid your way to the top of the search results and amazon
now is the third largest ad player 31 billion dollars a year nearly all of that is just amazon's
own sellers bidding so that when you search for their products you find them uh so um once you add
that all up it's it's north of 50 percent in fees now um most firms can't afford a 50 discount their
margins are less than 50 and so they raise prices at amazon now hypothetically this would be an advantage
for everyone else you could sell cheaper at walmart and costco and you know the corner store or
whatever uh but amazon has also a most favored nation clause which means that everyone raises their
prices at amazon and everyone also raises their prices everywhere else so all prices have gone up
because of amazon uh charging these uh junk fees uh to to their customers so right away you're going to get
less money um and your customers are going to pay more money for your cd and while you probably get
away with it technically you're not legally allowed to sell your cds at your gigs for less than they sell
on amazon so now you're now you're stuck selling uh at these inflated prices so you're going to sell
fewer of them and you're going to have kids at your punk rock shows you're going to go why is this cd
22 uh i i know what the cost of a blank cd is and if you explain to them it's because jeff bezos
needs another penis rocket they will be unsympathetic to you right exactly that is to say
those who don't pick the thing up and say what the hell is this and what do i play this sure sure
sure so that's that's that's part of it now your label might rip you off on your royalties and most
royalty contracts entitle you to audit your royalties but if you um do go and you audit your royalties
uh uh typically um you will find that if there is an error it is in your favor so we we cite in the
book a firm here in los angeles that's done tens of thousands of record contract audits
over decades there's only one instance in which they found an error that was in the favor of the
artist and not the label we have no explanation for the statistical anomaly we assume it's some
kind of terrible localized probability storm that makes life very hard for their accountants uh but um
when you find these stolen wages they're going to tell you that you're wrong and that you're going
to have to sue them if you want to get it which of course you can't afford but then they'll offer
you a settlement they'll say if you'll sign this non-disclosure agreement so you can't tell anyone
else where we hid the money we stole from them then we'll give you some of the money you think we owe
you but your auditor has to promise that they will never audit us again so they're going to have to
hire someone else to to dig for bodies in our backyard so that's another way let me just stop on that
because yeah just to unpack that if you can't if you have if you're an auditor and you've just gained
the expertise in knowing where the bodies are buried then the next person if you could use that
expertise who needs an audit could do so much less expensively because you've already invested the time
to learn how to you know correct where to look so what the accounting trick is yes exactly so and it's
not as though because you know i come out of the record label world i had a record label little one
um but it's not like those contracts were so generous to begin with that they couldn't afford to be
immensely profitable just by sticking with the contracts because you get well depending on what
period in history if you go back to the beatles era you know all right one penny or three four or five
percent um minus a breakage fee or in our case it was called a packaging deduction um minus the cost of
promoting your album that was considered to be basically an advance on your royalties uh as well as
the cost of production of the album as well as you know any involvement that the label might have in your
touring um and um and i'm going to guess that one of the the other wrinkles today is that if you are
paying promotional fees as a label to amazon because in my experience powerful retailers always get the best of
labels the labels back in my day it was tower records and they could basically dictate terms to all of the major
labels um they um that those fees would somehow find their way into your recoupables as well um so
you're already behind the eight ball you know and and though that lifetime supply of you know of piercings
seems very very far away right even if they were not cooking the books right and so you mentioned payola
there and you know there's a there's another form of payola so spotify now um has tried to wean uh all
of its listeners off of records if you if you you'll notice that if you try to search for an album you
generally don't find it what you find is a playlist the thing about playlists is that they're non-replicable
if you quit spotify the playlist doesn't come with you whereas if you quit spotify you can listen to
your favorite albums on any of its rivals youtube music has all the same albums as spotify but not the
same playlist it sells access to those playlists and it sells it by demanding that you give up the
absolutely laughable royalty you're entitled to so that's that's going to be bad for you now you're
going to you mentioned touring so you go on the road so uh there used to be two big ticketing
companies they had gobbled up all of their rivals ticketron and ticketmaster and 20 years ago
they were unwisely allowed to merge and take 90 of the ticketing market and then uh another company
live nation that controlled every significant venue that you might tour in all the stadiums all the
major clubs um and also use that advantage to lock up uh the exclusive right to book all of the
largest acts merged with ticketmaster uh and so now you have a single firm that's 90 of the ticketing
every significant club and the the exclusive touring rights to most of the major acts in america
and they're just dirty as hell uh so cbc did a great investigation they went and um looked at a
uh a uh conference that that ticketmaster throws every year where they invite touts who resell tickets
there's a there's a kind of slur that's used that i'm not going to use here it's an anti-indigenous
slur that's used to describe reselling tickets um uh so they they invite these people to a conference
where they celebrate the fact that these people work with spotify collude or work with ticketmaster
collude with them to buy all of the tickets the moment they go on sale and then relist them in a
secondary marketplace that ticketmaster owns so these first sales these initial sales go for a fraction
of what the final sales go for that's the bit that the artist gets their commission out of and then
they're sold again at 10 or 20 or 30 times that rate in a secondary market the ticketmaster controls
uh in the case of like bts there was just a ticket the ticketmaster flogged in a secondary market for
one hundred thousand dollars came with the right to dance on stage with the band there were
fronts front front front front uh row floors um and so bts doesn't get that hundred thousand dollars bts
gets the whatever maybe it was three hundred dollars that ticket cost and then uh nine and ninety
seven thousand ninety nine thousand seven hundred dollars that it sells for in the secondary market
uh over and above that price that's what the commission is is um based on and that commission
is split with the person who ran the bot that got the ticket from ticketmaster so ticketmaster claims
that they are solving uh the ticketing problem uh and that they are four square against these bots but
they're actually colluding with the people who run the bots the bots are coming from inside the house
now people who are listening now probably will have heard about the debacle with the taylor swift
uh ticket sale where ticketmaster servers melted now the the sale that ticketmaster servers melted on
was a pre-sale to people who were pre-registered who had bought tickets to a covet canceled tour
or who were part of her fan club they actually knew how many um buyers there were they had a full year
to plan for it and when they were given merger approval to merge with live nation and
previously when they were given merger approval to merge with ticketron they had said that um the
the excess rents that they would generate from not having to compete would be invested in better
infrastructure so that they could handle these giant ticket sales which they just failed to do
because instead they were doing stock buybacks and giant bonuses for their executives and just about
anything except for paying artists or building services that fans can use to buy tickets so when we
started you said what's wrong with this for fans well here's one of the things you pay more on amazon
your tick you can't buy tickets the tickets come at these hugely inflated prices and so on and then
when it's all done when your pocket has been completely picked you don't even get the satisfaction
knowing that the artist that you love got a dime from it right and um yeah i just see the these
difficult strategic choices in the corporate boardrooms let's see keep our promise and make our systems work
or stick the money in my pocket yeah make make the system work you know buy and buy a new yacht you
know uh so so but the one thing that the artist does risk from this is the reputational damage when
the fans feel that they've been ripped off and they associate you even if they at some level understand
that it's not you know me and my punk band that's you know that's doing this they still associate us with
that kind of rip off they can't help it um so at every level you know i'm on amazon i'm on spot if i'm
on if i'm an artist and i'm signed with an a an independent label you know chances are i'm guessing
that because spotify doesn't have an interest in my independent record label my chance of being on one of
those playlists is significantly less because they're not getting unless you pay payola right
exactly and payola of course for those who don't know it's something a long and storied history it
used to be bribery to get radio airplay there's actually a wonderful book about the golden age of
payola called hitmen i don't know if you if you've ever read it but i have read it yeah yeah you know i
mean the in the old days when uh uh you know like record executives would get confronted by angry
artists who hadn't seen a a dime of royalty after touring for a year and having hit records they'd
basically you know do a sob story hand them the keys to a cadillac and and say i'm i'm going broke
but you can have my caddy and you know the artist would go away feeling they they had been treated like a
favored son or daughter but really like you know the the record executive had a a parking lot full
of caddies because it was the caddy was worth like one one thousandth of of the of the royalties that
they were ripping off and yes yeah it's it's nothing has changed well so actually something has changed
which is that the firms are even more concentrated than they used to be and the reason for that happens
40 years ago uh when reagan mulroney thatcher the neoliberal leaders of the day uh embraced what
was then a fringe theory of antitrust enforcement called the consumer welfare theory and it's got a
long colorful story involving richard nixon solicitor general and all kinds of crazy things but but it
boils down to this that for for most of a century in the u.s antitrust law was enforced against firms that
got too big almost per se like just being too big was itself a reason not because they wanted to
punish success but they understood that if the government was going to play referee in the game
then it couldn't be less powerful than the players and so you just had to make sure that firms were
small enough that that they weren't too big to fail and they weren't too big to jail and the the
neoliberal doctrine said no no firm should be allowed to have monopolies um if they if they can find them
because those produce efficiencies they don't waste money on competition uh and the only time that we
should punish a monopoly is if we can prove that it's raised prices because of its market power
so not even the prices went up but the prices went up because of market power and and proving that is
very hard because the companies will say oh it was like oil prices or labor prices you know the moon is in
venus or whatever and especially when like an industry has got like two or three companies if
you're in canada and paying attention to the uh telus rogers merger you'll have seen this the the
companies claim that they're the way that their industry is structured just doesn't leave any slack
in it and that's why they raise prices and there's not really anyone who gets to say otherwise because
like there's only a couple companies in the sector and and they all tell the same
bullshit story and you know the people who counter it are are small like mom and pop isps like tech
savvy who are great but you know roger says well what does tech savvy know about the cost basis
for a national network they're just like up there they they use these essential facilities deals to
to provide dsl in a couple of big cities like they don't they have no idea they're not qualified
to speak on this we're the only ones qualified to speak on it and so what that essentially boils down
to is just total forbearance for monopolies just let monopolies form let them rip and you know here
we are right that three record uh labels and and two ad brokers and one ebook store they didn't come
out of nowhere that this is the result of forbearance for mergers and for predatory conduct like
uh below market pricing and uh most favored nation deals and the abuse of non-competes and so on
and it's not limited to the arts which is one of the points that we make in this book is that artists
aren't going to fix this because like we're just not powerful enough but if we make coalition with
everyone else who is chafing under monopoly corporate power you know like there's one company
in the world that makes all the glasses you've ever heard of doesn't matter what brand you're wearing
whether it's bausch and loam or dolce and gabbana or coach or or oliver peoples or or oakley they're all
one company it's uh it's it's called lonsotica essalore right yeah and they own every retailer
sears optical target optical uh um lens crafters uh sunglass hut all one company they also probably
insure your glasses the of your eye insurance is probably imed they're the largest insurer in the
world they make more than 50 of all the optical lenses in the world and they've raised the price
of glasses a thousand percent in a decade and they did it through predatory acquisitions and so
you know there are so many different people who chafe under this power one company makes all the
saline bags for all the medical uses in north america they're in they move to puerto rico because
it doesn't charge them income tax and then hurricane maria wiped them out there's no goddamn surgical
saline for a month right right right people people are suffering under this in a hundred ways
and but it's only by making common cause that we solve it right but the arts are are a great
case study because a they're visible even if they're not powerful and second of all um as you i think
you describe them as the canary in the coal mine but but also as especially in you know north america as
we've moved away from a manufacturing economy to a an intangibly based economy we are the arts are
you know sort of the the peak uh the pinnacle of the intangible world right we right we deal and truck in
ideas okay so we we've arguably i would say finance is even more intangible except they they don't get
the shitty end of the stick the way artists do well yeah the thing is that arts may be intangible but
at least they're real and a lot of finances yeah that's notional notional yeah um okay so we we dealt
with with the young musician and by the way for those of you who wonder how this affects you you're
the parents and he's never moving out of your basement because of all of this um okay and also
because of uh house inflation and wage stagnation and the fact that um your defined benefits pension
was replaced with a market pension which means you're going to have to liquidate all of your
assets for long-term care when you get old which will leave him with nothing and he's going to have
to hang around and wipe your ass because you're not going to be able to afford to pay for home care
uh well you know well now we know why that what now we know why governments are promising to invest
in infrastructure because we need more bridges for people to live under we do in fact need more
bridges but we also need more houses that's true okay not on the not on the goddamn green belt though
right exactly you you may live in la but you're uh you're absolutely on top of the pulse of what's
happening on the canadian side of the border that's for sure okay the fords are so stupid that like
the the the stupid just kind of like radiates it's like it's like the blast of a nuclear bomb like you
can see it from thousands of miles away it's like the it's like the the the uh radioactive traces from
fukushima washing up on the west coast like i am still i like like the the doug ford regime is so bad
that it's almost impossible to miss you would have to hide from it
and so it goes um all right i i've now been a punk musician i'm now a screenwriter and i'm
writing for films and tv right what what happens to me in this new highly concentrated world well
well let's talk about what happened and then what happened afterwards because it's uh it's a happy
story it's a good story yeah we've got we we do have five studios uh which is quite a choke point but
even more of a choke point was consolidation in the talent agencies uh they went through an orgy of
anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions uh resulting in four major talent agencies two of
which were owned by private equity firms that had loaded them up with a bunch of debt
and were required to vastly increase their profits in order to service that debt and so the way that they
did that was they took an old practice something called packaging and they supercharged it and so
the way the packaging works is that uh a um agency goes to a studio and says right you're making a tv
show we're going to package you a director uh a writer and a um uh a star and um we will take a fee from
you and then they turn around to those uh to that talent and they say we're not even going to take our
usual 10 because we made it up out of the packaging fee obviously this sets up some kind of conflict of
interest they might not bargain as hard for you if they're not getting the if they're not uh commissioned
but you know as i understand it in the 50s this was not a big deal but under the tender
ministrations the big four it became a very big deal what started to happen in the golden age of
television is that incomes began to decline very steeply for uh anyone who was signed to these big
four agencies which was everyone because they had the town sewn up so you had showrunners who were
getting a look at the books and realizing that the normal 90 10 split where they got 90 of the revenue
and the agency got 10 had become a 10 90 split where they were getting 10 of the money that was being
paid for the writer and their agents were were pocketing 90 and the agencies weren't happy with
that they were building studios and they were going to negotiate with themselves for their for their
clients uh work and this is obviously untenable and so the uh writers in hollywood are organized
under the writers guild in fact the writers guild across america organized in the writers guild they're
in the east coast the writers guild east and here it's writers go west uh and the two unions got
together and they demanded that the agency sign a code of conduct that uh required them to issue these
packaging fees and bargain as fiduciaries for their clients and to not and to divest themselves of
studios and and not set up these conflicts of interest that are irresolvable and uh all four of the
major studios balked and on one day seven thousand screenwriters every unionized writer who could work
in the closed shops fired their agent one day and then they ground out a 22 month strike against these
uh agencies these all-powerful agencies and you know the guy who led that strike who ran the the union
and he he was our interlocutor at our launch here in hollywood at the the the big uh library in beverly hills
and he showed up and he said you know when we started we thought the agencies had all the power
because every job we got came from them but we realized they only had the power because we gave it to
them like you can make movies without agents right you can't make movies without writers yep and it reminds
me of rutger bregman's uh book where he compared the garbage strike to the banker's strike if you
remember right yeah right exactly so the solidarity carried the day and you know wasn't just solidarity
among the struggling writers the writers who'd made it right the writers who were getting the big teddy
bear at the start of the day uh whose agencies weren't screwing them so that they could claim to be
good for their for their talent they saw through that ruse they fired their agents too and so you had this
circumstance this amazing circumstance where for nearly two years agents were represented by lawyers
by managers by themselves and one after another all four of the agencies um caved even the ones that
had been so debt loaded by their private equity financial engineer owners that doing so was an
existential threat to them that it might force them out of business right um because they they could
they could still pivot the business if they had clients but if they didn't have clients they could they
had no wiggle room and so the the solidarity among the workers carry the day for them yep absolutely
incidentally um and and this is something that i thought a lot about in terms of the golden age of
television because you know back when i was a wee squab uh there were you know four or five networks
um if you count the canadian side of the border um and uh and they basically had the entire audience
sewn up so if you you know produce some really schlocky sitcom like bewitched you still get a
gigantic audience um and therefore lots and lots of profit suddenly with the advent of cable and
streaming services you have this incredible explosion of content and you you know you may have a larger
population but not that you know not 10 times larger but you've got 10 times more content and you're
dividing the audience among that much more content so the amount of audience the number of eyeballs
per piece of content unless everyone basically quits their job and does nothing but watch you know tv
all day long is going to get smaller which means that either the ad rates go up disproportionately or
the revenues go down per unit and someone's got to pay and typically it's going to be the low
person on the on the on the pole and that would be the talent right yeah yeah i mean it's a little
more complicated than that because of all these weird uh like um you know broadcast retransmission
fees by the cable operator so one of the reasons that fox is so powerful is that every cable operator
has to choose which of the broadcast signals that they bring in and retransmit are going to be part of
their basic package and which ones are going to be part of their premium package and the fox does not have
a giant viewership but the viewership it has are incredibly uh ardent and they get very surety
if the uh cable operators don't include them in the basic package and so fox understands this
so fox gets i think it's eight times more to be included in that basic package than any of the other
networks and they get it for every single customer because they're in the basic package
right if you're in a premium tier you only get a premium you go to royalty for the people who pay
into that premium and so fox just gets this gigantic subsidy where everybody in america with
a cable subscription is giving three bucks a month to fox um whether or not they watch it whether or not
they agree with it and this is how fox can scare off all of its advertisers and advertise nothing but
like reverse mortgages uh you know mre's for the apocalypse yeah the my pillow pillows catheters you
know catheters and so on these just these terrible like low cpm advertisers and still just be rolling
in dough and paying their their leading talking heads millions of dollars a year right it's it's not
because they have the people it's because they found this this uh negotiating wedge and it shows you
how negotiating leverage and you know back to our discussion of whether copyright can solve things
negotiating leverage is what matters and so if all you're doing is saying here's a copyright
without a theory of how it translates into negotiating leverage you're not going to get anywhere now
there are copyrights that do this and in canada this was a huge issue the last time we reviewed the
copyright act which was whether we would include a termination right which is something that um came
into the u.s copyright system through the 76 act and in the 76 act the original proposal was that
after 25 years even if you'd signed a contract for the full duration of the copyright that uh contract
would terminate and you would get your copyrights back unless you took an affirmative step and sign
it back over your label so for most copyrights this would have no effect because people most copyrights
just don't produce any income the ones that do produce most of their income in the first 14 years
after 25 years most copyrights aren't worth anything but for the small minority of copyrights
that were worth a lot of money after 25 years if you're still producing 25 years later chances are
you started when you were young and when you were young and starting out you didn't have any leverage
and so you signed a bad deal and so after 25 years you can tear up that deal and make a new one
with someone else across the street in the end the deal that they struck uh in congress was 35 years
and you had to fill in a lot of paperwork and actually the record industry got uh uh an obscure
senate staffer to sneak in uh a uh a one-line amendment to a must-pass bill that uh opted musicians
out of copyright termination and it was so outrageous that they amended the bill again to take
it out again whereupon that staffer quit and became mitch bainwall ceo of the recording industry
association of america you you can't make stuff like this up i mean you're you're an imaginative
writer but you wouldn't have come up with that well no it'd be hacky right if you wrote that that
would just be like mustache twirling cartoon stuff right exactly and and unsophisticated you know it's
it's it's like the scams that we unravel in this book they're they are complicated but they're not
sophisticated right they employ a trick from the finance industry called migo which is my eyes
glaze over and it's when it's when you just add complexity so things are hard to understand or or
you know you add like not not complexity but kind of baroque phillips so things are hard to assist
self-reference and so on but once you untangle it's just like oh i see now it's just it's just stupid
and a scam it's a bit like finding out how sandbank been free was operating uh ftx you know it didn't
have some like baroque you know incredible master of the universe plan to rip people off people gave
him money to invest and instead of investing it he stole it right like it's just it's just not that
complicated no but it is but it does have one thing and that is complete shamelessness right you
know like you're you're okay i i we've done two parts of in my role-playing game there's a third part
okay this is the last one okay i'm corey doctorow and i just wrote a novel called attack surface
and i love having good audiobook versions of my work and i also um have cultivated a kind of a
different business model that allows me to thrive and survive and you know develop a relationship with
my readers all right yeah how let's sure do the the audiobook first and then yeah the because what
you've done in your own career is although there aren't individual solutions that is will bring the
walls of jericho down there are some clever ways that people can can thrive in this environment
yeah so i i uh will not allow my work to be released with what's called digital rights management on it
and this is uh an encryption scheme that um you you need to have the keys for to unlock and so
you know audible sells you an audiobook it's encrypted with audible's keys and only the
players that audible permits can decrypt it and play it uh and under a u.s law from 1998 the digital
millennium copyright act it's against the law to give someone a tool to remove this wrapper
so you can move a a an audiobook or or any other drm locked media to another platform so you know you
could you could format shift your cds and you could format shift your records but you can't format
shift your digital files if i give you a tool to do that it's a felony punishable by a five-year
prison sentence and a 500 000 fine and and this is bad in the u.s although it was passed in 1998
when you know i think that the people involved will claim retrospectively that they just didn't
understand how important digital technology would be to canada's uh enduring shame we passed our
version of this in 2012 at the behest of tony clement and james moore although this was bipartisan
because before the tories tried to pass it the liberals tried to pass it in the person of sam
bolte uh and um this these laws mean that if i sell you an audiobook on audible it is permanently
locked to audible you can't leave audible without leaving behind all the books that you bought
which means that i can't leave audible for someone who'll give me more money because there's no way you're
going to leave audible and follow me there which means that every dollar that i earn from audible is
is uh weakens my bargaining leverage against audible and makes things worse for me and you know i saw
that coming from day one the other publishers did not and now audible has 90 of the market and all of
those books are locked forever to amazon's platform you as the rights holder it's the publisher you can't
authorize uh a listener to take their audiobook somewhere else only amazon can do it and amazon's
never going to do it and so you have all this the stock locked in to them and they use that power
to abuse their writers in all kinds of ways so they they operate this um independent platform called acx
where if you're like an indie writer a small publisher you can use acx to locate a narrator or upload
your own narration of a book and then sell it through audible alongside the other books and in theory
there's nothing wrong with this that's really cool in practice these are the writers with the
least negotiating leverage and so some of this has changed in the wake of the scandal that i'm
about to tell you about but when the scandal started if you put a book up on acx even though
you paid for the production you couldn't sell it anywhere else for seven years so every copy had to
be locked to acx forever and you couldn't sell it anywhere else for seven years remember most copyrights
stopped producing at 14 years so that's half the productive life of that work um and uh and so yeah
so it was locked to them for seven years and then audible wants to keep subscribers subscribing because
so long as those subscribers subscribe uh writers will give them audiobooks on preferential terms to
reach those subscribers so they have these subscription plans where for a certain amount of money every
month you get one audiobook every month and what audible would do is when you were done listening to
that audiobook is they would bombard you with messages encouraging you to return it as unsatisfactory
you would get uh pop-up messages you get emails you get the months after you'd finished listening to
the book saying like you know that book that you listened to twice six months ago if you didn't like
it you can return it and we'll give you your credit back you can get another book and now your
subscription becomes more valuable but amazon doesn't have to pay for that extra value because when a
reader returns a book amazon claws the royalty back from the author and so the authors didn't know this
they they they had a vague sense of it but the royalty reporting they got was all on a net basis so
all they would see is oh you sold three copies not you sold 20 copies and then we induced your customers
to return 17 of them and clawed that money back from you and it wasn't until there was like a data glitch
and they they did three weeks worth of returns all at once that writers began to understand the full scope
of just how badly they were being ripped off and a writer in perth australia susan may began a
campaign called audible gate to call them to account for this and one of the writers who joined this
campaign was a british mystery writer she's a retired forensic accountant who now writes thrillers about
forensic accountancy finance scams and she was like i'm gonna i'm gonna look hard at this her name's
calling cross so she looked hard at it she figured out that amazon wasn't just clawing back one royalty
when a book was charged was returned they'd actually double claw you so they'd get they
they they'd take it out of your account twice plus they just weren't paying you the royalties they
promised that the the royalty structure that they promised was not reflected in the sums that were
being produced she thinks that it's hundreds of millions of dollars in wage theft well so long before
i knew this scam was going on i understood that it was not to my advantage to get locked into audible
let audible gain the whip hand over me so i just refused to let my books be sold on audible my
publishers all understood this and after a few not hugely successful attempts to sell them on the
smaller platforms um they just gave up and let me keep my audiobooks and there's an interesting
reason why the books don't sell on smaller platforms which is that there's another choke
point which is um android ios android apple and the android apple choke point extracts a 30 tax on
every sale now the gross margin on an audiobook is 20 that means that if you sell an audiobook through
an app on google or ios you lose money which is why the only stores that you can buy audiobooks through
that come as an app are come from apple and google now you can buy uh through web stores but um although
when both of these devices began they had extensive tools to allow you to move files from the web
to your phone they've removed all of those tools it is almost impossible if you have an mp3 on your
desktop to play it on your phone and so the only way to get these files is through an app and the
only way to commercially successfully or or viably sell through an app is to be the platform so you
have this this incredible monopolistic thing so i'm like i'm just going to sell to the weirdos who
are willing to jump through all the hoops to listen to an mp3 on their phone so after after you
know random house and mcmillan tried it and couldn't make it work i with my uh book uh 2020 book attack
surface did a kickstarter for it it was the most successful kickstarter uh for an audiobook in world
history raised 276 000 pre-sold thousands of copies of the ebook as well which were all sold on the on day
one uh and um and generally did very well uh and what we repeated this for chokepoint capitalism
in fact we repeated it and we did something really funny which is that we took the chapter about how
audible steals from authors and we put it on audible as an audible original uh so you can't get it
anywhere except audible just that chapter it's like an audible exclusive uh at through this acx platform
anyway we raised over a hundred thousand dollars that way too and we we sold print books as well
which which um logistically was harder like i still like i gotta go to the mailbox today and mail another
book because there were some stragglers who filled in their their um their surveys late and our
fulfillment partner is done so i'm like fulfilling it out of my office here but but it was cool to do
and i'm gonna do it with my upcoming books i have some more books in production i'm gonna do this for
as many of them as i can spare the time to do it for because um fantastic it was very cool well so
first of all i love the fact that you gave the the middle finger to jeff bezos with the chapter or
shall i say the middle uh the middle penis rocket uh indeed yeah too we we also put up the spotify
chapter about how spotify rips off artists as a spotify exclusive so excellent excellent the jokes
write themselves absolutely but just again because i want to make sure that people really get this that
if i'm a writer and let's face it writers spend in some cases years to create a book this may be
something that they're going to rely upon for you know for their livelihood and they end up um basically
for it what what is now an increasing part of book sales is the audiobooks i mean it's become
phenomenally popular yeah it's it's as much revenue as you would expect to see from the hardcover or the
paperback so basically you go on to audible because it's virtually the only place to go or one of the
very very few places but it's 90 of the market people can't leave um if they're dissatisfied customers or if
they they decide that they don't like you know jeff and and his and his rocket um they basically
may have invested in you know 50 100 200 audiobooks but they won't be able to play them if they go
somewhere else literally they can't they're blocked for being played so they have to basically burn their
library of alexandria and start a new library somewhere else but that somewhere else will have a much
smaller selection and potentially you know fewer features in the playback because you know let's
face it being a world-level monopolist means that you've got a lot of r d money to to create a good
user experience um and uh at the end of the day they literally are telling people don't pay corey any
royalties return his book so that we can do anything possible to avoid paying him royalties
and presumably their revenue stream is is coming from memberships right correct yeah that's right
so they get their money from the from these uh revenues from these uh recurring revenues right
exactly in other words you know you are essentially a slave working for the privilege of making jeff rich
yeah they figured out how to uh well i don't like slave metaphors because there are actual slaves
but you are certainly uh uh very poorly served in a way that is like manifestly unfair and you know
one of the things that people ask us about this book is like how do you know when a company is unfair
what about this practice what about that practice and they'll pull out all these edge cases and i'm
like you know what let's just leave those edge cases for now right let's just go after like the
thing where they just steal from you yep and and once we fix that part then we'll then we'll like
look at the edge cases yeah exactly now i i i want to get on i mean there's so much to talk about i
would love to talk about the role of private equity in this because that's a kind of a cesspool unto
itself um and um and let's face it the the the um desiccated carcasses of once viable companies
that have been left at the roadside after you know their their blood and vital fluids have been
extracted um is you know now legendary um but i i want to talk a little bit about the the audience
experience before we go on to some of the solutions and i don't want to give the solution short trip
because we we promise that it's 50 of the book uh but sure it is so it's so interesting because from
the point of view of many customers if i can use the word customer let's i like audience members
um arts lovers you know we're living in a golden age you know the convenience has become so and
selection has become so vast you know i can go on to prime and you know find not everything but a huge
huge selection if and if i'm prepared to search beyond the you know the the above the full part
i can find a lot of things that they're not going out of their way to make available one click lets me
lets me uh buy it easily you know delivery is is fast and it's free or seems to be free it's actually
not free but it's been externalized onto others um and you know similarly with spotify you know i mean
i don't have to think for myself i don't have to learn about a lot of music i don't have to hunt
the algorithm tells me what music i want to hear which i think is rubbish but anyway um and takes a
lot of the fun of listening to music out of it um but there is a kind of a toxic side to convenience
um in the sense that you know it makes us complicit in harming a lot of other people including the
artists who are who we claim to love who we want to see rewarded fairly but it doesn't feel that way
because all we're doing is giving into an impulse and pressing the the one click button and you know
um and prices you know well they may be a little less low but they're still relatively low so you know if
you is in other words this makes us as audience members complicit in doing a lot of a lot of bad
things you know and keeps it invisible to us that you know we're part of that complicity
ah so i don't know that that's the case uh so so first of all i think that the benefits are are
uh overstated and short-lived uh you know the the as as we we discussed with the dc attorney general's
antitrust case against amazon those low prices they're not just externalized they actually end up
getting they they rebound they um they end up back uh being forced onto you you just don't see it
because the prices have gone up everywhere because of amazon's most favorite nation so the the prices go
up at costco and you can't see that amazon's charging you more too um so that's that's part of it
there's also you know what i what i call the inshification of online services so if you think
about online services um or you know any kind of venture-backed company they they have these
surpluses right at first those surpluses are represented by their investors capital so it's
you know money that they've got in the bank basically and then later it's represented by their profits
and they like to allocate those surpluses at first to bring in users um because the users bring
in the business customers so if you're amazon you bring in a bunch of users which lures in marketplace
sellers and publishers uh if you're uber you subsidize uh 41 cents out of every dollar in a cab
ride so that you bring in lots of of riders and then once you've got a lot of of um you know users
then you can shift subsidy to your business customers so you can ship those surpluses to your business
customers and you can give them uh free shipping and you can give the drivers big bonuses for
picking people up and you can do all these things to kind of um evince these like deep structural changes
in how people work so uber is a really good example here like we all over the world we had a lost decade
on public transit investment right and other taxi firms failed because the saudi royal family let them
lose 30 billion subsidizing cab rides right and a lot of independent business people aka independent
cab drivers who had invested their life savings in a plate basically were wiped out yeah and i'm not
going to defend the medallion racket it was terrible right but it wasn't replaced by something better you
know uber's story that they were fixing a corrupt system is not true they they got rid of a corrupt
system and replaced it with an even more corrupt system right they squeeze those surpluses out and then
eventually you know like so once they've got the you hooked right once once the users are locked
into their corral and the sellers are locked into their corral once you've got both sides of the hourglass
sealed tight and you got the choke point in the middle then you can just start extracting surpluses from
both and handing them to your shareholders which is why the first six screens of amazon are not the
thing you searched for it's why you can't find the band you're looking for on spotify and you get
suggestions of other bands you don't like because uh they have shifted from showing you the thing that
you want to showing you the thing that makes them the most money and you know that is that is not um
good for consumers or audience members or fans or you know riders or anything none of those things are
good for you right so that that's i think the right way to view it but i also want to say that um
the emphasis on individual responsibility and the idea that it's just through that it's that our
our unwillingness to endure inconvenience that causes this problem is i think ultimately a destructive view
because this is not the product of individual choices is the problem of systemic choices
right uh and you won't fix them with individual choices so zephyr teachout who's a law professor in new
york has a wonderful book called break them up about monopolies and and i think it's in the very last
chapter she says look if there's a protest against amazon and you miss it because you spent three hours
driving around looking for markers at a mom and pop shop so you can make a protest sign you you are not
doing yourself or the movement any favors right amazon just won right right the problem isn't what
you're buying and or where you're buying it and not only that but there is nothing about the parts
of amazon that are convenient that we should dislike you know if amazon so say for example that you could
create a cooperative of local merchants that um normalized all their all their stock keeping units
all their sq skus uh the codes they use to refer to their uh inventory to match them up with the asin
numbers that amazon uses that is in the url of every product you buy and then they reported all that
to a neighborhood database or city-wide database and when you went to amazon you could have a browser
plugin that if you were looking at a product that was for sale locally would just notice that this asin
corresponded to inventory that was local and would rip out the amazon buy it now button and replace it
with a buy it locally button right the fact that you can find everything you want on amazon is not the
problem with amazon and the extractive relationships in amazon are not intrinsic to it right no one came
down off a mountain with two stone tablets that said jeffrey make your drivers pee in their vans
right we we can do delivery without it being inhumane um that the inhumane part is fully separable in the
same way that like facebook doesn't have to spy on you right facebook was the privacy forward
alternative to myspace when it opened up to non-university students in 2006 and it legitimately
was they promised they would never mine your data everyone forgets this right so can you run facebook
without surveillance well i think we have a definitive answer in the fact that we did run facebook without
surveillance so even though facebook wants you to think that there is no facebook without surveillance
that that is not a trade-off that you must make that's a trade-off that they demand of you that
could be negotiated away and i'm not going to say that the problem is that we want more time to spend
with our families or that we are working three jobs and we don't have time to run all over town and get
things i'm going to say that the problem is that our lives have been arranged so that we all have to
work three jobs we don't have enough time to spend with our families and the convenient places to buy
things are incredibly extractive and abusive not because they have to be but because their owners
chose to make them that way exactly and and you know i didn't mean to suggest that you know we're
we're bad human beings but simply that um the systems the way they are set up are very seductive
and it's part of how they've managed to grow and become so monopolistic as well as their you know
predatory practices and their you know untrammeled acquisitions and all the rest of it um their
stifling of competition and you know it reminds me of something that uh that uh michael parenti used
to say that the people who run the system are very modest in in what they want they only want one thing
everything so if there's more that you can extract you know and it involves compromising people's
privacy go for it if you can create locks that keep people you know in you know as your customers
that make it hard for them to leave go for it because it gets you more more and more and then
some more on top of more um anyway that's the problem and you know we haven't even touched on
antitrust i'm astonished that the abiding administration which let's face it is not the
pinnacle of progressivism somehow seems to be that way when it comes to antitrust and has actually
you know appointed people who are you know taking real proactive measures but antitrust alone isn't
going to do it there are other systemic changes and that is a a nice way of shifting to um the other
50 of the book which i hope we'll be able to to not give short shrift to but now that we've kind of
explored the problem and um and how it affects both creators who are basically being ground down
and prevented from enjoying the the fruits of their labors and to some extent you know we as um as the
the lovers and purchasers and enjoyers of the art who are paying higher prices and being you know
deceptively prevented from having all the selection that appear it appears that we have but it's not
real um there are policy answers and there are not individual actions but collective actions that can
help turn the tide and and can you run through a few of those for us yeah so i mentioned one already
um which is the this contracts issue with non-disclosure you know one of the one of the strange things about
about monopoly is that all of the contracts are signed in four states because all the companies
are headquartered in four states california new york seatt washington because of amazon and the
games companies and tennessee because of nashville so contract is a matter of state law if we amend
the state contract law with a short bill that says it's a matter of public policy non-disclosure
cannot be enforced where it pertains to uh material omissions or misstatements and royalty statements
uh then like at the stroke of a pen you put more money in people's pockets than 40 years of copyright
term extension ever did you know it's like a crack in the machine that you can stick a uh a cry bar and
wheel it around money pours out of it and into artists pockets all over the world because all of
their contracts are consummated in those four states uh in the european union the digital single
markets directive in 2019 which was a mixed bag and had some very bad things had one amazing thing
which was a transparency right and not like sort of an anodyne like kumbaya transparency but just the
right to know specifically how were your royalties calculated how much revenue did your work generate
uh you know what um what share was held back what was the gross sale of your work uh just so you can
see right so you can know whether you've been ripped off um and also in the european union the digital
markets act uh requires uh the largest firms uh to have interoperability so apple has just uh well they
haven't announced but they've just leaked the fact that they are going to offer alternate app stores for
their mobile platform now the devil's in the details but to comply with the regulation they're
not going to be able to force their payment processing on those um on those other app stores
which means that if you're an iphone user you're going to be able to get your apps from someone other
than apple and they don't have to charge a 30 app tax to the to the app makers that are in that app store
which means that maybe we'll get more than one audiobook store right ios interoperability
basically means things are portable right you can go elsewhere wearing too right the it's the idea that
the person who sells you your shoes doesn't get to tell you which socks you have to wear with right
right that's interoperability it's like it's you can you can use any forks with any knives to eat off
any plate and you can put any condiment you want on the side of that plate the vendor doesn't get to
decide the fact that apple for now i guess 15 years has had the position that if you buy a pocket
computer from them you you surrender the right to decide which software runs on it is frankly
bizarre and aberrant and shouldn't be the case same with video game consoles it's really actually
fascinating because the entire ethos of apple seems to be telling the customer we know what's
what's right and what's best for you you know if you if you if you just happen to like having
a headphone jack built into your phone well tough we know we know better the thing is that sometimes
they do it with your interest and heart yeah but not always right so you know this is something
that's called the feudal security model by the security researcher bruce schneier although a
historian reader of mine wrote to me and said it's not really feudalism it's manorialism because no one
has to raise an army uh that's the that's the defining feature of feudalism so in this feudal manorial
security um you know there are you out there in the world there are marauding bandits you know identity
thieves and trolls and denial of service people and whatever and uh and if you want to be defended
from them you can move into a fortress that's been built by a warlord like apple or facebook or google
and they have these mercenaries these security experts who stand on their battlements and defend
you from the from the bandits which is great but they won't defend you from the warlord and so
when the when when the warlord decides that your interests and theirs diverge that fortress becomes
a prison so if you're an apple user generally speaking they do a pretty good job of making sure
that there are no malicious apps in the device and that your privacy is respected except in china where
they removed all of the privacy tools and put back doors in their cloud servers and got rid of the
features that were allowing chinese users to anonymously organize demonstrations with airdrop
because not because they don't like chinese people but because they can't afford to piss off the chinese
government because then they would lose access to 350 million middle-class chinese consumers and uh
equally or if not more number of low-wage chinese laborers uh and then they wouldn't be able to make
or sell their phones um and and so one of the things that interoperability does is it changes the
equilibrium right so when a firm is like we could make more money by screwing over our users in this
way and if we don't think they're going to leave if we think the switching costs are so high if we think
they have to leave behind so much when they go you know surrender their media they've bought surrender
their email address surrender all these things that are important to them then we can actually abuse them
a lot before they leave but if users can go then firms have to treat them well not because they're
good people but because they understand the consequences of being bad people right and and that's you know
again a big piece of the story that i guess it's sort of the what i call the hotel california effect
you know you think you can check out but you can never leave or the roach motel right your data
checks in but it never checks out right um okay so um interoperability what are some other things that
that can help i mean we run through a whole bunch of them and they run the gamut from from one weird
trick to deep structural change so you know obviously we talk about labor rights uh in there and and
revitalizing union organizing for creators and we we see how that works but there's solidarity without
unions that works well too so we've talked a couple of times about uber drivers here in california uber
drivers were um subjected to rampant wage theft by uber and uh they wanted to sue but uber had bound
them all over to something called uh binding arbitration which means that you don't get to take
your case in front of a judge instead the company has to hire a corporate fake judge who works for them
who then hears your case and decides whether uh you or their employer are in the wrong it will not
surprise you to learn that the literature is pretty clear that you get less money and you are found
to be in the right less often when the judge works for the person you're suing um but even if you do
eke out a victory uh it's not precedential so the next person doesn't get to to use it and it's
generally covered by non-disclosure so this is a real problem because the sums involved in the uber
drivers lawsuits were so small that they wanted that you know big to them but small in terms of the
cost of suing a multi-billion dollar company that they just couldn't afford to sue they needed to
form a class action and so on and a law firm out here uh figured out how to automate arbitration claims
and so instead of suing you know a million of them getting together and so hundreds of thousands of
them getting together and suing them as a class they filed hundreds of thousands of class of uh
arbitration claims each of which came with a multi-thousand dollar bill for the arbitrator
and uber went to court and said you know your honor this clause that requires binding arbitration
is so manifestly unfair that only an idiot would think it was enforceable please let us get out of
it and the court said no you made this veggie lion and uber gave the drivers 150 million dollars that's
incredible i mean i don't think i've ever heard of a case of the party that wrote the contract
claiming that it was unconscionable you know but there you go yeah you know yeah yeah it's it's
it's quite amazing you know what sauce to the goose is sauce to the gander so you know we we have a
bunch of these uh technical proposals like we should standardize the metadata that collecting societies
use around the world we should have a single pool we should reform how the collecting societies operate
so that they're not allowed to spend unattributable royalties on anything except for royalty
attribution technology we should uh have uh easier copyright termination and it should be international
um and uh and require fewer hoops to go through and cover more kinds of works you know these are these
are the kinds of things that we talk about uh in the second half of the book and you know the the theory
here the theory of change is that crises are inevitable anything that can't go on will eventually
stop and these systems are so iniquitous they're so odious that they are going to provoke crises in
the future and when those crises arise we're going to reach for what what my arch enemy milton friedman
called ideas lying around right whatever it is people have been talking about on the fringes can move to
the center very quickly in a crisis this is kind of the to use a little more can con here this is the
thesis of uh uh the excellent book the shock doctrine uh you know by naomi klein that that you
know when shocks occur that is the time when when profound changes can be can be got in and you know
as i say the other part of this theory of change is that creative workers should have solidarity with
other kinds of workers and vice versa that the people who struggle under corporate power are not limited to
creative workers there are some distinctive characteristics to creative workers we talked
about how copyright is singularly ineffective when it comes to addressing these choke points there's
another thing that creative workers share with uh several other classes of workers which is something
theorists call vocational awe which is when you feel like a duty to do your job and this is something
that teachers and daycare workers and elder care workers nurses doctors they all share and you know our
bosses know this right they you know creative bosses know the joke that when the kid runs away and
joins the circus and the dad goes and finds him shoveling elephant shit and says son come home that
the kid will say what and quit show business but you know bosses and every one of these caring
trades knows this too and this is how you have the fords saying to the teachers what are you going to do
leave these children that you care for all day alone at school and go out on strike
you know we get to abuse you this is why you see nurses going on strike here in california because
their bosses say what are you going to do leave sick people festering in their beds because you want
higher wages and um it is only through solidarity that we overcome the vocational law which is which is
due right there's the it is justified to feel pride and duty but it's only through solidarity that we
that we overcome the abuse of this the exploitation of it my my friend the dear departed david graber
who died during the covet pandemic uh in um well it's still ongoing but at the height of the covet
pandemic david wrote a book called bullshit jobs where he identified an amazing book and he identifies this
problem or this pathology that so many jobs are so empty and soulless that if you have a job that gives
meaning to your life you're expected to charge a discount for it because you know what do you want
you want to be happy working as a teacher and earn a living wage you got to pick just one right you
know it's it's the people who's you know lauded is in life to wear a thousand dollar suit but sit at a
desk all day just being like a box in an org chart for a princeling at a financial services firm
who have no satisfaction in their lives those are the people who need to command these premiums because
what else do they have in their lives and you know that we that is um that is a phenomenon we have to
reverse and we do it through uh reaching across different sectors and understanding the common
pathology that we all suffer under i i guess that means that that riding a penis rocket is the most
miserable job in the world because clearly it's the best paid uh well it's certainly certainly
causing your marriage yeah yeah um but it's very interesting that um that culture workers have
this you know this great strength which gets turned into a vulnerability which is they feel a calling
to their work and they love what they do also they are the vulnerability that many of them have solitary
work you know to be a writer is spending a lot of time in front of a screen with a keyboard which tends
to work against building those um those linkages of uh that foster solidarity solidarity and collective
action but clearly the writer's strike shows that it can be done yeah yeah it you know i i think that
for all the squabbling and fractiousness of of arts gossip and and so on that fundamentally uh
uh we do have solidarity with one another you know if you if you want to see just how how great art
solidarity can be uh read up on the disney animation strike which was just incredible and it and it
featured these wonderful moments like you had tex avery and the other animators from warner's and
the other studios fleischer uh fleischer rather showing up at the uh disney gate at the dates the gates of the
disney studio to stand on the picket line with their brothers and sisters from uh the disney studio
with like giant cardboard guillotines they'd made in which they decapitated the cfo of the disney studios
and effigy i mean it was incredible you know and and like a lot of these guys hated each other yeah but
they they they understood that an injury to one is an injury at all yeah exactly exactly now this is not
to say that um that there isn't an important role for antitrust as well and you know uh we seem to be
you know after all these years of you know this idiotic view that you know the only thing that
counts in terms of antitrust is consumer prices as if you know you can't create costs that are
externalized so that it creates the impression that you know that just because it doesn't come out of
one person's pocket it isn't still a real cost or that there aren't other legitimate interests like
people who want to start small businesses who get crushed um or innovative ideas that get stifled
because they get bought up by monopolistic companies and they that holds all of society i mean these are
such obvious principles that you think how did robert bork manage to graduate from law school let alone
become a judge you know uh i mean well he didn't get confirmed to the supreme court so there is that
yeah that's where the term borked comes from if you've ever used the term bork to describe something
that's gone very bad yeah it refers to his disastrous confirmation hearings for the supreme court yeah but
sadly you know we we don't have the coney barretted uh example yeah not yet well she got she got it
through yeah exactly but the the point is that for people who may you know be of a let's say a a
pessimistic mindset you know okay some of the the things that are described are significant policy
changes so there has to be a policy maker who's prepared to stand up to the lobbies to the lobbies
that don't want to see the the balance of power shift i say surprising things can sometimes happen
like you end up with you know lena khan you know how how did that happen um you know i think that uh
the best way to understand it is it's the triumph of the sanders wing of the party i you know i i think
the best thing that you can say about biden is that he is an empty vessel onto which different factions
in the democratic party can project their will and he is faithful to the to whichever faction triumphs in
some squabble which uh which means that um if you can get your faction to the foreground then he will
he will dutifully uh carry water for them i i think he is i don't think he's all there like i think he's
kind of losing his marbles but i also think he's just he's not um he's never been a principled politician
i know people who know him and people in the white house who say that he's very good i just struggle to
believe it um but but well you know the let's just say though that his that his time in office shows
that it is not impossible for progressive policies to to be implemented so the reality is that an army
of small donors dollar donors and grassroots organizers who spent years building up the
political salience of a popular politics through the sanders wing of the party even though they did not
get their candidate into the white house or into the on the final ballot they achieved significant
goals and that those goals are uh providing momentum for future grassroots organizing and i i should say
that in canada there are open proceedings now on revisions to canada's absolutely useless competition law
uh and that they're inviting and encouraging um uh submissions from the general public and that
you know if you are in the sound of my voice and you are in canada or a canadian you should be
submitting to these hearings to say that you think that the fact that say that shaw and rogers can merge
uh even though the the minister and the bureau are both opposed to it because the law does not permit
them to stop it means that the law is inadequate and that they should not have been allowed to merge
those are things you can say to demand change right and and for those who think that um antitrust seems
like a very arcane and abstract area of activity um you know first of all you know read chokepoint
capitalism but also while you're at it when you've got the bug read uh matt stoller's goliath which
basically talks about the relationship between um antitrust or concentration of economic power
and democracy because you know i've often felt that um you know the american revolution was in part
fought over uh taxation without representation but we now have a situation where an analog to
taxation is completely privatized you know you have to pay this every month in order to be part of
society pay the app tax right pay the app tax yep and so i think that's right and i would also
recommend david bayan's brilliant book monopolized which is a very brisk read and very very good
yeah well i think we've come to to a good a good breaking point but you know for those of you just
just to we've sort of wandered over the over the coloring lines of the arts but to bring it back for
those who care about the ability of artists to get fairly compensated which means that they will be
able to continue and have a career in in the arts rather than give up and you know go and do something
and do something that is much less fulfilling for them and much less fulfilling for us you know it is
in all of our interest to see a healthy ecosystem in which um artists can be properly compensated in
which they're not getting screwed over in which we are not societally rewarding theft and fraud and
you know uh shady dealing but um we can basically let a thousand flowers bloom um you know uh not to
use a an invidious image um yeah and but god sorry about that um but it's it's i that's you know what
the worst was that one time i was talking about this book and and and i was talking about all the
solutions in the book and i got to the last chapter and i said in the last chapter we have a final
solution i was like oh don't call it that no no hey yeah and it was it was rosh hashanah it was the
worst oh dear uh okay well let me let me press rewind and we can all pretend that i didn't say that but
the point is that we can have a healthier infrastructure in which artists don't give up in which they can also
be happier in their work because they're actually seeing some of the proceeds flowing their way
which i think is in everyone's interest you know we don't want to basically get 50 or 100 years from now
and say you know what artists were better off under the medici you know and the uh you know uh the borgia
popes than they were under the era of bezos and and uh and whoever's behind um spotify
i agree yeah i agree and so uh with that i i have to say it's always a joy to speak with you cory it's uh
stimulating and the ideas come very fast and very very thick uh uh but the uh but the point is that you
know um if we really want to be in a world where you know the arts really count um then the artist
needs to get paid and they need to get paid fairly you know if we're if we're prepared to pay you know
x dollars you know most of that x dollars should ultimately end up in the hands of the person who made
it heck yeah yeah well thank you very much thank you so much i really really appreciate the time
um and uh good luck with the next book and it looks like there's a next one after that already in
the works and many others yes thank you all right thanks so much all right the glenn gould foundation
