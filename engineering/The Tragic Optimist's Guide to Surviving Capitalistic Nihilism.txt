The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.
Greed is right. Greed works.
I walk through these cities, the cities of the Western world, London, New York,
and sometimes it resembles the most poverty-stricken cities of the East.
There's been a breakdown, a betrayal of the social contract in Western life.
Are you depressed or is it just C-A-P-I-T-A-L-I-S-S-M?
The I-N-D-I-V-I-D-U-L-I-S-S-M?
We live in a society, and this particular brand of society is dominated by never-ending consumerism,
endless competition, and the pursuit of profit.
Slaves worked all the hours they were awake for their entire lives.
I think, like, if they can do it, so can I.
And while existing in this society, a lot of us have found ourselves grappling with a profound sense of emptiness.
We wake up, we work to survive and consume to feel whole,
and yet the promises of capitalism, prosperity, happiness, fulfillment,
these things seem increasingly out of reach.
In America, consumerism and individual success are celebrated as the highest forms of human achievement.
Yeah, I just want a house in Florida.
But why?
I-I don't know.
And on the surface, it sounds great, but if you just look a little bit deeper,
it can feel as though the very soul of society is being hollowed out.
Once you peep game and lock into the fact that this overwhelming system ties our human worth to economic output,
what normally happens is that instead of feeling like you're the villain in your favorite film
that's glorifying white-collar crime, we're usually left with anxiety, disillusionment,
and a creeping sense of nihilism that questions whether any of it matters at all.
Is anyone else, like, too aware?
Is there any meaning left to be found in a world governed by profit margins and consumption?
The rise of nihilism, and that's a belief that life lacks intrinsic meaning,
has become an increasingly common response to this existential crisis.
So I'm not surprised that a lot of people are so lonely when they're like,
I don't want to talk to anyone, I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any friends,
I just want to stay home and, like, be on my phone and not do anything.
Add in a hearty American-sized portion of unfettered capitalism,
and it doesn't take too long before you start to get that lonely, sterile, millennial beige feeling inside
that hints at the idea that, indeed, yes, meaning has been lost in the endless cycle of production and consumption.
And yet, amongst this existential dread, a counterforce emerges, tragic optimism.
Tragic optimism is rooted in the belief that meaning can still be cultivated, even in the harshest realities.
For me, it provides a framework for surviving and even thriving within a world that often feels void of purpose.
And so in this essay, we're going to explore how capitalism has eroded our sense of meaning,
fueled a crisis of nihilism, and how tragic optimism can offer us a pathway forward.
We're going to lock in and take the time to examine how, through resilience, community, and critical reflection,
we can begin to find meaning and a deeper sense of purpose, even in the most nihilistic of circumstances.
By tracing the roots of capitalistic nihilism, unpacking the philosophy of tragic optimism,
we'll figure out together how to survive and maybe even thrive in a system that seems indifferent to human well-being.
So welcome, dear friends, to the Tragic Optimist's Guide for Surviving Capitalistic Nihilism.
As always, I would like to preface this video that I don't know shit.
And I'm just sharing my thoughts with you on how I've learned to navigate this rock
for the oh-so-brief amount of time that we are here.
I first discovered tragic optimism at nine years old while covering the Holocaust
in my fourth grade social studies class taught by Mr. Bell.
So, Mr. Bell, if you ever see this, MVP.
I won't trauma dump on you, but what I learned in that class has stuck with me
and carried me through the darkness of my entire life.
And so now I will share it with you, dear watcher.
On a more slightly morbid, so trigger warning, but in a very tragically optimistic, hope core fashion,
I recently found out from a cultural perspective
that Black women have regularly had some of the lowest self-opt-out of life rates in the U.S.
despite being some of the easiest targets that get dogpiled on.
Black chicks.
The Black women.
The Black women are the least attractive of all the races.
Black girls.
Some of this Black chick, it's like...
And I don't know.
I don't know.
That just gave me a little affirmation that, you know,
should you also want to get some tea or get cozy?
Maybe fold that pile of clothes on your bed or, you know, load the dishwasher and yap with me about it.
That when it comes to perseverance and navigating through the darkness,
should you want to do that?
Maybe, just maybe, your girl might be on to something.
Part one, what is capitalistic nihilism?
As we touched on a little bit earlier,
capitalistic nihilism is that creeping sense of disillusionment
when you realize that your life, your value, your sense of self has been reduced to transactions.
It's that feeling that no matter how much you work or how many things you acquire,
there's always going to be something that is deeply missing.
It's a hollowness that material success cannot fill.
And we see it all around us.
We see it in the endless amount of ads.
We see it in the grind.
Stop breathing like a f***ing bunny rabbit.
A bunny rabbit is a victim and it breathes in and out so quickly.
You can see its stomach going in and out.
We see it in the obsession with hustle culture or pushing for the next paycheck.
Teens should spend at least five of their teenage years just trying to become successful.
And so before you start hating in the comments, let me say this.
It literally takes $82 a day to make the average yearly income in America.
You need to start three passive income streams
and master the 46 ChachiBT tools that just launched in the last six minutes by midnight tonight.
Generation alone.
Or you can feel it in that emptiness that comes after yet another purchase
that was supposed to make everything better, but it didn't.
This isn't just a feeling.
It's a symptom of a system that prioritizes profit and productivity over human well-being.
A lot of people have been sold the idea that fulfillment comes through what we can buy
or what we can achieve.
But the more that we try to fill that void, the larger it becomes.
Let's take Fight Club, for example.
Fight Club serves as a pop culture mirror into this experience.
The main character shares how his life is a series of consumer choices
and career accomplishments, but none of it makes him happy.
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we don't need.
In his disillusionment, he becomes consumed by a desire to break free from that very system that traps him by descending into violence.
This is capitalistic nihilism in its most raw form.
It's the realization that the system was not designed to fulfill us,
but rather to keep us endlessly chasing a carrot that's always out of reach.
A very brief history.
Capitalistic nihilism isn't new.
So we're going back to the Industrial Revolution,
and this is when people were first reduced to mere instruments of labor on a mass scale.
Happened very much before then, but this is the first time on like a mass scale,
driven by machinery.
We're starting to see more and more documentation of the connection between people and their work
beginning to fray as workers were turned into cogs in the industrial machine.
And so no longer was work a source of identity or a source of pride.
Instead, it became something that stripped people of their humanity.
This alienation, as writers like Dostoevsky and Nietzsche pointed out,
started to breed a profound sense of purposelessness, a nihilism that questioned
if any of it mattered if life was only reduced to production and consumption.
Later on in America, James Baldwin took this critique further,
highlighting how capitalism didn't just dehumanize people through labor,
but also through the racial structures it upheld.
And so for Black Americans, who had long been stripped of their humanity through chattel slavery,
the system was particularly brutal.
Not only did it deny them human rights, but it also excluded them economically.
Baldwin's thoughts on capitalism and race were pretty clear and striking,
but if you actually pay close attention, his ideas go beyond just race.
His critique of the American dream wasn't just about the ways in which Black Americans
were shut out of the promise.
It was also a warning to the entire nation,
to anyone who would listen about the fragility and emptiness of that very dream.
It's been a breakdown, a betrayal of the social contract in Western life.
And people are grabbing for things and holding on to what they think they can get
and stepping all over their neighbors because they have hammocks drinking.
What, they're comforting themselves with material things?
Yes, when people do that, something is beginning to crack.
People hoard all this because they don't have anything else, but they don't really believe in it.
Baldwin understood something that the rest of America is only starting to wake up to now,
and it's the reality that capitalism's dehumanizing tendencies are not confined by race.
Though race certainly sharpens the impact.
When I think of his words, it comes as a great shock to discover
that the flag to which you have pledged your allegiance has not pledged allegiance to you.
Now, if you choose to listen, it's very easy to see that these words don't just speak to the Black experience,
but to the disillusionment that so many are beginning to feel today.
The system was never built for human fulfillment,
and now more people across all backgrounds are starting to realize this,
and the alienation and despair that Baldwin spoke of in the context of Black life under capitalism
are now being felt more broadly as the system fails to deliver on its promises to everyone.
We see this in the growing disillusionment with work,
as more people in American society question the value of grinding themselves down in jobs that offer little to no return,
especially since the pandemic, which I personally feel forced them to sit still for a lot longer
than most people had for the very first time.
And we started to see that disillusionment again in the rise of quiet quitting,
the rejection of hustle culture,
where people are now starting to push back against the idea that their worth is directly tied to their productivity.
It's fairly clear that Baldwin's critique of America was always bigger than race.
It was a critique of a society that defined success in terms of material wealth
while leaving its citizens spiritually and emotionally bankrupt.
And so as America wakes up to the reality that the pursuit of profits has hollowed out what truly matters,
connection, purpose, and fulfillment,
we're confronting that same nihilism that James Baldwin warned us about.
The system wasn't built to serve us, but to exploit us.
And the American dream, though once it was very aspirational,
it now feels like an illusion.
What's different today is that this disillusionment,
once confined to the margins and marginalized groups,
is spreading to the center.
That was the true original definition of woke before it was adopted by right-wing pundits and conservatives.
Would you mind defining woke?
Because it's come up a couple times and I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
So, I mean, woke is sort of the idea that I,
this is going to be one of those moments that goes viral.
I mean, woke is something that's very hard to define and we've spent an entire chapter defining it.
It is sort of the understanding that we need to re-totally reimagine and re-re-re-do society
in order to create hierarchies of oppression.
Um, sorry, I, it's, it's hard to explain in a 15-second soundbite.
To be woke was to be aware of the very reality that people are waking up to right now.
The structures that promise prosperity are showing their cracks
and more and more people are realizing the deep existential costs
of chasing something that was never meant to fulfill us.
And Baldwin's warnings about capitalism's dehumanizing effects
were never just for black Americans.
They were for all of us.
He saw the writing on the wall as many others did.
And now, as more people wake up to the emptiness of these promises,
everyone else is starting to see it too.
Capitalistic nihilism is no longer a fringe experience.
It's becoming a defining feature of modern life.
In many places in America, we're no longer,
we no longer live for community or connection or self-fulfillment.
We live to survive in that system that defines us by our productivity.
And as Baldwin pointed out,
the shock of realizing that the American dream was never truly meant for us
is what fuels this modern sense of nihilism.
So, all this to say, what's happening now isn't new.
It's just a broader awakening.
More people are beginning to see that the system isn't built for human fulfillment.
It's built for economic gain.
And the alienation that Dostoevsky's characters felt in the industrial era
and the spiritual emptiness that Nietzsche predicted are now our widespread realities
as the cracks in the system become impossible to ignore.
As we dive into capitalism's effects, let's examine its personal impact.
Part 2.
The Impact of Capitalism on the Individual Well-Being
In the race for American success, I want to make it very clear.
I live in America.
I'm speaking in the context of America.
I have little experience in other cultures.
But because I live here, I'm speaking of our default particular brand of unfettered capitalism
and what it encourages, which is a never-ending pursuit of profit,
individual achievement, and competition.
We know this.
Nothing groundbreaking here.
Mental Health and Capitalism
Capitalism thrives on the idea that anyone can make it if they work hard enough.
Yet this narrative, while inspiring on the surface, hides the mental strain it places on individuals.
We're told that our worth is tied to our productivity,
that to rest is to fall behind,
and that our value comes from how much we can accumulate.
The constant need to succeed to keep climbing the ladder often leads to stress and anxiety.
When your self-worth is tied to your job performance and your ability to mass wealth,
or if you deserve to go to the doctor or not,
every setback feels like a personal failure.
This is why burnout has become so common, especially in our country where work-life balance is
seen as a luxury rather than a right.
If you really want to get mad, watch the movie Where to Invade Next.
I'm just going to leave it there.
Full stop.
The gig economy, which is often pushed as a flexible work alternative,
often just makes the problem worse.
Because it creates an environment where workers are expected to always be on,
but without the security or stable income or any of the benefits.
And so this leaves the individuals grappling with stress and uncertainty and a deep sense
of exhaustion that just kind of sits on the surface of their daily lives.
But it's not just the stress and burnout that capitalism fosters that'll get you.
It's the growing epidemic of loneliness and isolation.
The drive for individual success, often at the expense of community,
is what leads to an erosion of social bonds.
So in a society that prioritizes self-reliance and individualism,
asking for help is seen as a weakness.
And we have become a nation of isolated individuals,
working harder, increasing productivity, but being paid less and connecting less.
And so the more disconnected we become,
the harder it is to form the kinds of meaningful relationships that foster mental well-being.
And this isolation is exacerbated by the rise of social media,
where we're constantly comparing ourselves to curated versions of other people's lives,
where instead of fostering genuine connection,
we're left feeling like we're always falling short,
which further erodes our mental health.
The rise of individualism and its consequences.
One of the most misunderstood aspects of American culture
is the notion of rugged individualism.
Rugged individualism is the idea that success is achieved by the individual
without the need for community or government support.
And while this idea, the idea of this idea, can be empowering,
it also comes at a cost.
And it's the erosion of community bonds,
because it results from prioritizing individual success over collective welfare
that weakens the social support systems that are vital for mental and emotional health.
There's a common misconception that the degradation of society
is due to a shift away from traditional or conservative values.
But in reality, the unraveling of community bonds
is more about the unchecked rise of individualism.
People aren't turning away from each other because of inclusiveness.
They're turning away from each other because they've been conditioned to believe
that self-reliance is the only way.
They believe that everyone on the block should each have their own lawnmower
instead of everyone pitching in and sharing and maintaining one lawnmower
and then pulling the money that everyone would have spent towards individual lawnmowers
towards something more beneficial for the whole community,
like a community garden, community garden supplies, maintenance, organizing community events,
block parties to foster connections, supporting local schools, youth programs,
creating a community tool library for sharing other equipment, etc.
You get the picture.
We are more concerned with having a better lawn than our neighbors to do anything like that.
This version of American individualism has created a culture where we are isolated
even when we are surrounded by others, where connection is secondary to competition.
This is perfectly evidenced by this clip.
I have a Hindu garb at our neighborhood swimming pool that my daughter is asking.
I'm trying to explain.
She's like, you know, what, like, and I don't even know what country I'm in,
in my own neighborhood.
I just, I don't, I don't know where I am.
It's, you know, I mean, the number of, when we go on a family walk,
the number of Pakistani, Hindu, all these different, not just ethnicities,
but religions with, with visible religious outfits on.
Because at the end of the day, again, it's not about whiteness,
but at the end of the day, if things get rough,
I don't know if my Hindu neighbor is going to fight to save the lives of my children.
It never occurred to him, even as a pastor,
to just talk to his neighbors or just get to know his neighbors.
When a community is sacrificed in favor of self-sufficiency,
people are left to bear the weight of their struggles alone.
And as the gaps between the wealthy and the working class widens,
productivity increasing while wages remain stagnant,
those at the bottom are increasingly told that their failure is their own fault,
further deepening feelings of inadequacy and alienation.
Lack of empathy and ethical considerations.
As capitalism promotes self-interest, empathy begins to diminish.
We start seeing each other not as fellow human beings,
but as competitors or worse, obstacles to our own success.
And so this erosion of empathy can make it easier to rationalize behaviors
that would have once been seen as unethical.
Whether it's cutting corners at work or it's exploiting others for your personal gain,
the drive for profits often leads to ethical compromises,
both in our personal and business.
Question for you, dear watcher.
What happens when a society starts to prize business, STEM, and finance degrees,
while at the same time denigrating degrees based on humanities or ethics?
What happens when we glorify the ability to make money
over the ability to think critically about what's right and wrong?
We end up with a culture where success is defined not by moral integrity,
but by profit margins.
In a country where the economy is separated from social influences,
the values that hold us together begin to break.
The glorification of exploitative success.
In case y'all didn't know, white-collar crime is my Roman empire.
It's no secret that our media glorifies the kind of success
that often comes at the expense of others.
Movies like Wolf of Wall Street celebrate the exploits of white-collar criminals,
turning them into cultural icons.
Whenever I see a movie or a TV show portray these crimes as smart or edgy or fun,
I swear it makes my eyes start to twitch.
What's most troubling to me is how the glorification of exploitative success shifts societal values.
People begin to believe that bending or breaking the rules is just a part of making it.
Resonate with you that what greed is good was going to mean to Gordon Gekko and Wall Street?
No, that whole part was, I mean, I was the bad guy.
I was the villain.
It's always shocked me how many people on Wall Street have said,
oh, man, you're the reason I became a stockbroker.
And I said, I said, I went to jail, man.
I went to jail.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's all right.
You know, going on.
The American dream, once synonymous with hard work and honesty,
is now increasingly associated with getting over on people
or getting ahead by any means necessary.
Here we also have to confront the uncomfortable question,
can billionaires truly be ethical?
When you quantify how much a billion dollars is compared to the average salary,
how many lifetimes it would take for most people to earn that much,
what I have found is that most people who defend billionaires sit in two camps.
Either they don't understand what a billion is,
or they somehow think that they will also eventually be billionaires.
They're just down bad right now, but it's coming.
But peep game and lock in.
If you spent $1,000 a day, it would take you more than 2,700 years to spend a billion dollars.
2,700 years.
Let that sink in.
And hopefully, you can begin to see the staggering inequalities that are built into the system
when America is a country with the most over 800 billionaires, to give you a clearer picture.
Now, is it possible to amass such wealth without exploiting people or resources?
This is a question we have to grapple with, especially when income inequality continues to rise.
Social ramifications and extreme outcomes.
The social fabric of our country is fraying under the pressure of this individualistic competitive system.
We're seeing the rise of the lone wolf phenomenon,
where individuals feeling alienated and powerless resort to extreme actions,
sometimes, oftentimes, with tragic outcomes.
In a society that both isolates people and prizes individual success above all else,
it's no surprise that some individuals lash out in violent ways,
feeling as though they have no way to assert their existence or validate their pain.
It's this individualism.
It's the disconnection from society,
combined with the lack of adequate mental health support and unrestricted access to firearms,
that has led to a full-blown mental health crisis.
Add in the fact that we have inadequate healthcare systems
that leave many people without the resources they need to address their mental health struggles,
and you have a recipe for disaster.
And while, yes, capitalism drives innovation,
it also fosters an environment where profits are prioritized over people's well-being.
When it comes at the expense of empathy, community, and mental health,
we have to ask ourselves,
is economic growth worth it if it undermines the very things that make life worth living?
In marginalized communities, capitalism's failures are even more apparent.
Systemic neglect, this can be seen in the underfunding of schools,
lack of healthcare access, and targeted policing,
lead to a sense of hopelessness that can manifest in violence.
When the system fails to provide meaningful work or opportunities for upward mobility,
young people internalize the belief that their lives hold little value.
The resulting cycles of violence seem like random acts.
They are actually symptomatic of a system that has long abandoned these communities.
Lack of meaning and purpose in a capitalist world.
Whether it's the lone shooter or the Wayans in the hood,
the root cause of their nihilism is the same.
A lack of purpose in a world that values them only for their economic output.
The lone wolf shooter becomes disillusioned with a society that rewards wealth and success,
but offers no pathways for those who don't fit into this mold,
or they haven't received the promise they felt that they were entitled to
because of the unrealized lie of the American dream.
They feel invisible, and their alienation pushes them toward violence as a means of making themselves seen.
Similarly, but also differently, marginalized youth feel that capitalism has nothing to offer them.
Generations of systemic racism and economic exploitation have left black and brown communities disenfranchised and hopeless.
In a world that equates worth with economic success, but denies people the tools to achieve it,
violence becomes a coping mechanism for the void left by the unattainable American dream.
There's a creator I really like, Deontay Kyle.
He has a fantastic interview where he's just outside talking,
and some kids walk past the filming, walk past the set,
and he randomly invites some of this youth to come over and talk to him.
And it's a beautiful exchange, because these kids are initially keeping up like their hard exterior at first.
That is until Deontay begins talking to them like they're humans, and their entire demeanor changes.
They've been invited into the fold.
They're being spoken to, not spoken at.
And if you listen closely, you look with intention, you can see how badly these kids are craving hearing and being heard.
It's the same system that fails them, just as it fails the lone wolves,
leaving them with a sense that their lives have little value outside of economic success,
which is often just outside of reach.
James Baldwin famously said,
The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose.
This observation captures the essence of capitalistic nihilism,
whether it's the mass shooter or the young person turning to gangs.
The common denominator is a profound sense of having nothing left to lose,
a byproduct of a system that strips away their humanity.
The role of media and technology.
Modern media and technology play a significant role in both perpetuating and exacerbating these feelings of nihilism.
This is cultural.
Do not get confused about this.
In the age of social media, we're constantly exposed to a curated version of other people's lives,
making us feel as though our own existence is insignificant.
We encourage comparison, reinforcing unattainable,
or for the most parts, very shallow standards of success and happiness.
Very surface level.
On top of that, a lot of us have just become desensitized,
mainlining violence straight from our feeds in ways that we haven't before.
And I say this to you as a product of like the rotten.com era.
Things are wild now.
You would think that things would be better,
but the internet is actually like a much scarier place.
But all of this contributes to feeling of alienation and fosters the belief that our lives are somehow less meaningful than what we see online.
Take, for example, the phenomenon of doom scrolling.
And as a result, something that another creator has fantastically called the mainstreamification of loserdom.
People are spending hours consuming negative news, social media content,
which only reinforces the feelings of despair and hopelessness.
Instead of using technology to connect us,
these platforms often leave us feeling more isolated and more disconnected from each other.
And as a result of this in the U.S., we crave third spaces,
but we actually have no clue how to talk to each other.
Social media gives the illusion of connection without the substance,
further deepening the sense of isolation that fuels modern nihilism.
Even more unlikely examples of capitalistic nihilism.
Capitalistic nihilism doesn't just affect those on the margins.
It's present at all levels of society,
even those who seem to have, quote unquote, made it.
One really strong example of this is Anthony Bourdain.
For the uninitiated, Anthony Bourdain was a celebrated chef and TV personality.
And by all intents and purposes, Anthony was living everyone's dream.
He would travel all over the world.
He would eat delicious food.
He would have interesting conversations with interesting people.
This is the life that people yearn for.
And even still, it wasn't enough.
Despite his global fame, despite his success,
Bourdain struggled with deep personal demons.
And in 2018, he took his own life.
And his suicide shocked the entire world.
It should have highlighted the internal emptiness
that even the most successful figures can experience under this system.
Bourdain's life exemplifies how the pursuit of success
and wealth and fame can fail to provide true fulfillment
and instead lead to feelings of existential despair.
All this to say that while the lone wolf, mass shooter, and the wyans in the hood
may seem to be polar opposites,
they are actually both products of the same culture,
the products of the same system,
one that devalues human life and fosters nihilism and alienation.
These things don't exist in a vacuum.
Capitalistic nihilism is the thread that ties them together
as both groups experience the same elements.
Their actions are not random,
but they are the symptoms of a deeper systemic issue,
which truly at the heart of it is a systematic failure
to address root causes of alienation, meaningless, and hopelessness.
These individuals are often left behind by a society
that values productivity, greed, and success over human connection.
And their actions, however horrific, are a manifestation of that neglect.
And so I'm going to clarify something here.
Please don't misunderstand me.
This is not an excuse or justification for violent behavior.
But again, none of this exists or happens in a vacuum.
And when people find themselves scratching their head,
wondering how something so tragic,
like gang violence or mass shootings,
could be happening in America,
focusing on the individualist aspects of it.
Why would someone do this?
Though doing so helps us place tragedy
in a nice, neat, little, simple package
that we can rationalize and we can push it to the side
and the very moment we swipe away from the news article about it,
it also creates blind spots for wider pattern recognition.
And of course,
capitalistic nihilism isn't confined to the lower classes
or extreme cases of violence.
Recognizing patterns allows you to see that
it seeps into every corner of society,
affecting even the highly successful,
the wealthy, and the famous.
If you care to look,
you can see it in corporate employees
burned out by endless work cycles.
You can see it in celebrities
whose fame cannot shield them from despair.
It's everywhere.
It's a system that affects us all,
even when we don't think that it does.
The problem
isn't that you aren't achieving enough.
It's that the goalposts keep shifting.
And even when you do make it,
you realize that the promised fulfillment often isn't there.
You have been encouraged to chase,
but rarely to find.
And as more people wake up to this realization,
they're beginning to see that the problem isn't with the individuals,
it's with the system itself.
Now more than ever,
more of us are starting to question the price that we're paying for that.
Okay, all right.
That was a lot, right?
After all of that,
you're probably thinking,
well, the most natural next line of thinking to conclude
should be, probably is,
Deja.
What is the point?
Well, that is why we are here, friend.
In the face of this systemic disillusionment,
I offer you an alternative philosophical framework
as a possible antidote to the chaos.
Tragic optimism.
The tragic optimist's perspective,
finding meaning in pain, joy, and impermanence.
Life is suffering.
Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out, hear me out.
Life is suffering,
but life isn't only suffering.
In the chaos of life where suffering is inevitable
and the world often feels indifferent to our struggles,
tragic optimism offers a powerful way
to face the darkness without losing hope.
This philosophy rooted in the works of thinkers like Viktor Frankl
teaches us that meaning can be found
in even the most difficult circumstances.
Yet to fully grasp tragic optimism,
we must also look back to James Baldwin
who understood the deep relationship
between pain and transformation.
Baldwin believed that our suffering,
far from being something to avoid,
was something to be used.
Something that could be used to illuminate truths,
to fuel growth,
and to ultimately find liberation.
It was Baldwin who told us,
you are compelled,
you are corralled,
you are bullwhipped into dealing
with whatever it is that hurt you.
And what is crucial here is that if it hurt you,
that's not what's important.
What's important,
what corrals you,
what bullwhips you,
what drives you,
torments you,
is that you must find some way
of using this to connect you
with everyone else alive.
This is all you have to do it with.
So with that being said,
let us explore the pillars of tragic optimism
while also getting clear on the difference
between necessary and unnecessary suffering.
We'll also touch on the importance
of embracing impermanence.
Embracing pain as a teacher.
Tragic optimism.
Tragic optimism is a philosophy
unlike toxic positivity, okay?
It doesn't ask us to push away our pain
or ignore it.
Instead, it encourages us to acknowledge
suffering as an integral part of life
while still holding space for hope and growth.
This idea was popularized by Viktor Frankl,
who after surviving the horrors
of a Nazi concentration camp,
argued that even in the darkest of times,
we have the power to find meaning in our suffering.
He believed that while we cannot control
our circumstances,
we can control our response to them.
James Baldwin wrote extensively
about how pain can be a source
of understanding and personal power.
In his essay, The Fire Next Time, he says,
you think your pain and your heartbreak
are unprecedented in the history of the world.
But then you read,
this shows us that pain is not something
to be avoided or ignored,
but embraced and understood.
It's what connects us to being human.
And he believed that through acknowledging the pain,
not running and using our pain,
we can transcend it.
He continued on,
you must understand that your pain is trivial,
except insofar as you can use it
to connect with other people's pain.
And insofar as you can do that with your pain,
you can be released from it.
And then hopefully it works the other way around too.
Insofar as I can tell you what it is to suffer,
perhaps I can help you suffer less.
It's probably really easy to tell by now,
but Frankel and Baldwin have long been
two of my favorite proponents
of the tragic optimism perspective.
And I've kind of weaved that throughout my own life
because they highlight a critical component
of tragic optimism.
And it's that suffering is inevitable,
but it can be meaningful
if we choose to engage with it constructively.
And probably what I want most people
to take away from this video
is that nihilism and cynicism
in the face of suffering or tragedy
is like the downhill flow of water.
It's the easiest, most natural,
the next in line thing to do.
And no one would blame you
if that's what you chose to do
when it comes to navigating
your very short time here on this rock,
no one would blame you.
But I think the most important aspect to understand
is the reality that it is a choice nonetheless.
Nonetheless, you still choose that.
And should you find yourself making that choice?
My very next question would be,
how is that working out for you?
Balancing realism and hope
and the difference between necessary
and unnecessary suffering.
So one of the key pillars of tragic optimism
is knowing the difference between necessary
and unnecessary suffering.
I've talked about this at length in another video.
So if you want to check that out, please do.
But basically, necessary suffering
is suffering that is going to be required for growth.
And unnecessary suffering
is something that is self-inflicted.
In Baldwin's work,
he often speaks of the necessity
of facing uncomfortable truths,
particularly about race, identity, power, status, health,
as a means to personal and societal transformation.
There are things in our lives that are inescapable,
meaning as a human being on this planet,
you will deal with them.
No one gets out of this.
There is no cheat code or anything like that.
You will go through it.
So these are things like grieving,
the loss of a loved one,
taking care of an aging parent,
the emotional pain of ending a relationship,
personal failure, sickness, death.
These are components of necessary suffering.
He argued that the only way to heal from the wounds
was to confront them head on,
no matter how painful the process might be.
This is necessary suffering,
the kind of suffering that leads to growth and liberation.
However, on the other hand,
unnecessary suffering occurs when we resist reality
or we refuse to accept life's inherent uncertainties.
Missing out on a fun time to study for your bar exam
is necessary suffering.
Giving yourself an anxiety attack leading up to the bar exam
because you chose not to study for said exam
would be unnecessary suffering.
A cheat code to figure is this necessary
or unnecessary suffering is if you're suffering
and you were to stop doing something
like going back to an abusive ex
or, you know, eating after 11 p.m.
and the suffering that you're experiencing eventually stops,
you're probably inviting unnecessary suffering into your life.
Tragic optimism teaches us that while suffering is inevitable,
not all suffering is productive.
And the only way to navigate life is knowing the difference
so that when you are inevitably confronted
with necessary suffering,
you can face it forthrightly
instead of being distracted
or having additional stress piled on
by unnecessary suffering too.
I went to a 10-day silent retreat
and you'd be surprised at what you can hear in the silence.
But something that I learned
that has shifted my perspective a lot
is how we as humans tend to exist in two states,
craving or aversion.
We're either craving an outcome
or craving something we don't have
or we're avoiding something.
We're avoiding doing something.
Which places us too far outside of ourselves?
By craving something,
we're probably living in the past,
craving a time that we cannot have
or craving something in the future
or we're avoiding existing in the present,
something that we need to address or do
and keeping us in,
when we're bouncing in between these two states,
we are in our own personal hell.
For example,
the pain of trying to maintain an illusion,
whether it's the illusion of control,
the illusion of something lasting forever,
or the illusion of a life
free from any hardship whatsoever,
it just leads to more suffering.
And Baldwin understood this deeply,
noting that much of the pain in the world
comes from denying the truths
that are too painful to face.
Otherwise, of course you can despair.
Walk down the street to any city,
any afternoon,
and look around you.
What you've got to remember
is what you're looking at is also you.
Everyone you're looking at is also you.
You could be that person.
You could be that monster.
You could be that cop.
And you're deciding yourself not to be.
Running from reality
doesn't shield us from suffering,
it just prolongs it.
In contrast,
facing suffering directly
allows us to discern
what is within our control
and what isn't.
What suffering is necessary for growth
and what suffering we can let go of.
That while we cannot escape hardship,
we can escape the suffering
that comes from our refusal
to accept reality.
The path of tragic optimism
asks us to engage
with necessary suffering,
to allow it to shape and refine us,
and to let go of unnecessary pain
that we create
by clinging to illusions
of permanence or control,
or delusions of grandeur,
or how we feel things should be.
Impermanence
and the importance of not running.
Another key aspect of tragic optimism
is the understanding of impermanence,
the idea that nothing lasts forever.
For Baldwin and Frankl alike,
the knowledge of life's impermanence
was not something to fear,
but something to embrace.
It's through this lens
that we can better navigate
both suffering and happiness,
knowing that neither of them
will last forever.
Running from this reality
keeps us trapped
in that space of craving and aversion.
Facing it allows us to grow
and move forward.
This understanding of impermanence
frees us from the fear of loss,
by allowing us to experience life fully
without clinging to any moment.
Suffering, like joy,
is impermanent.
Nothing lasts forever.
And let's cover a couple ways
that will make it
so we don't have to cling.
Strategies for tragic optimism.
Personal coping mechanisms.
Life often presents us
with overwhelming challenges,
which should push us
to question what matters
and whether it's worth trying at all.
Tragic optimism offers a different way
to engage with these struggles,
providing us with personal strategies
to navigate the chaos.
One of the most effective
personal strategies
for cultivating this,
and it's going to sound super cliche,
but hear me out,
is mindfulness.
Mindfulness is the practice
of staying present
and embracing the moment
as it is.
Not as we want it to be,
but as it is.
Accepting that reality as it is.
And by focusing on
what's happening here and now,
in the here and now,
we can avoid getting lost
in the future's uncertainties
or the regrets of the past.
Craving, aversion,
craving, aversion.
In 2022,
I took a solo trip to Europe
and my luggage was stolen
partially through my trip
and it should have ended in disaster,
but it didn't.
I chose to make it
as much of an adventure as I could
and I turned the trip around,
but by the last day,
I had had a mission
and my mission was
I was going to roller skate
to one of my favorite songs
in, the song is called
Vondel Park by John Craigie.
I was going to roller skate
to that in Vondel Park
in Amsterdam.
That was the mission.
I was like,
this has to happen.
And I ended up going
to Vondel Park
and it was raining that day
and I stumbled onto
this random stage
to skate on.
Even though it was raining,
the sun came out
and I remember in that moment
being so keenly aware,
so keenly aware
that this joy
wouldn't last forever.
I remember trying
to hold so tightly
to every detail I could.
I remember looking around
and being like,
I'm skating,
I'm moving my body,
the sun has just come out,
I feel the sun on my skin
and this little Dutch mom
comes up to me
and she asks me a question
and I can't hear her
and I take my headphone off
and she says,
can my son dance with you?
And I was like,
of course.
And she puts her little child
up on the stage with me
and I'm skating
and this little baby
is twirling around
and this song,
this beautiful song
is in my ears
and I remember thinking,
like I was at the top
of the world.
I felt at the top
of the world
and I remember thinking,
this won't last forever.
And being present
and in it at that time
made it so that I focused in
on every detail
that I could.
The feeling of the sun
on my skin,
the smell of the air,
the laughter of this child
and just the beauty
from the absolute chaos
of that trip
that I was experiencing
in that moment.
I knew in that moment
that this experience
that I was experiencing
was going to be something
I would look back fondly on
that would warm me
in the darkness
because darkness is inevitable.
And to have that consciousness
or that awareness
in the moment
made it so that
I gave that moment
everything that it deserved.
I was there.
I was fully, fully in it.
I didn't want to look back
at that memory
and be like,
I wish I had, you know.
No.
I was fully free
in that moment.
I'm very grateful
to have had that awareness
and to have given that moment
what it deserved
because the darkness came.
And I'm grateful
that I gave that moment
everything that it needed
so that I could pull
from that moment
as proof that life
was an all-minsery business.
I needed that.
I needed to put that
into the bank
of how beautiful
life could be
to get me through
that darkness
because when it came
it leveled me.
Less than six months later
a car crashed
into the new house
that I had just bought
to help my brother
rehabilitate
from his addiction.
But three weeks after
that I got the call
that he would never
get to see the house
because he had died.
And then three weeks
after that
I was laid off
from my job.
So I went from
the top of the world
to being in the absolute gutter
in less than six months
and I cannot stress
how grateful I was
to have been mindful
in that moment
on that stage
to be so aware
of the joy
that I was experiencing
and its impermanence
and giving it the respect
that it deserved
because I knew
that it would not last
forever.
That same mindfulness
that warmed my soul
in the Amsterdam sun
helped me be fully present
in my grief
of my brother
and it helped me
to not run
or try to escape
the pain
when so many
traumatic things
were happening
at once
because I knew
that also
like that joy
that pain
wouldn't last forever.
All this to say
mindfulness
is just
the beginning.
Resilience
is another key
in the Tragic Optimist
Toolkit.
Resilience means
facing the harsh
realities of life.
accepting that suffering
is a part
of the human experience.
You cannot have joy.
You cannot have
roller skating
in the sunshine
in Amsterdam
without the pain
of saying goodbye
to your brother
for the last time.
You don't get to
cheat.
You don't get to
avoid it.
And learning
from these realities
you can do that
instead of being
crushed by them.
In Rick and Morty
Rick Sanchez
exemplifies someone
who lacks resilience.
Despite his intelligence
Rick's awareness
that nothing matters
leaves him
in a state
of deep depression
and self-loathing.
When you know
nothing matters
the universe is yours
and I've never met
a universe
that was into it.
He stops trying
because he believes
it's all pointless.
But compare this
to Jerry Smith
his son-in-law
who consistently
tries to be
a better father
and a better husband
despite constantly
being belittled
by others.
Jerry's efforts
though often ridiculed
and bring him
contentment.
He represents
a kind of
tragic optimism.
He knows that
he's not perfect
but he tries to
find meaning
in small ways.
Acceptance
is another
essential strategy.
Embracing life's
impermanence
not as a form
of giving up
but as a way
to find meaning
in the temporary.
Rick's despair
stems from his
inability to move
past the meaninglessness
he sees in life.
Jerry however
embraces his
ordinary life
and finds joy
in the small victories
like ridding
his driveway
of weed.
This contrast
shows the power
of acceptance.
Jerry's contentment
comes from engaging
with the present
while Rick's refusal
to accept life's
impermanence
leaves him isolated
and paralyzed
by nihilism.
Community
and solidarity.
While individual
or personal
coping mechanisms
are important
community and solidarity
provide a crucial
foundation
for tragic optimism.
Humans are social
creatures
and when we connect
with others
especially in the face
of hardship
we realize that
we are not alone.
The beauty
of tragic optimism
is that it doesn't
require us
to go through
life's struggles
in isolation
rather it encourages
us to seek out
collective strength.
We saw this
widespread during
the pandemic.
Neighbors helping
neighbors,
mutual aid networks
so it is something
that is possible.
In the movie
Everything Everywhere
All at Once
Evelyn Wang's
journey only gains
meaning when she
reconnects with her family.
Despite the infinite
versions of herself
she encounters
it's her relationships
that anchor her
and give her life purpose.
Her bond with her
daughter Joy
becomes a source
of strength
and healing
demonstrating that
even in the vastness
of existence
it's the people
we love
who give our lives
meaning.
Here's a slight caveat
please don't
misunderstand me.
I know that
a lot of us
do not have
healthy families.
I am not saying
go and reconcile
with your family.
That's not what
I'm saying at all
but what I am saying
is that
you can create
your own family
and that
the family
that you choose
still counts
as meaningful
relationships
and interactions
it's still a conscious
choice
so please don't take
what I'm saying
as a means
of like
hey you need
to go reconcile
with your toxic
family
that doesn't
respect your
boundaries
or are just
like abusive
to you.
That's not what
I'm saying
in case it needs
to be said.
Okay back at it.
Ultimately
community and
solidarity are
important
because they
ground us
in the present.
They ground us
in the here.
They ground us
in the now
where our actions
and relationships
hold significance.
Rick Sanchez's
nihilism isolates
him from meaningful
connections
leading him
to destructive
behavior.
He isolates
himself from
others believing
that his
intelligence
translates loosely
to his
superiority
and his
understanding
of all of
the universes
makes relationships
pointless.
He lives by
the idea
that nothing
matters so
why bother
trying?
It sounds
sexy but
this attitude
leaves him
empty and
depressed and
unable to
find joy or
meaning in
anything.
Jerry though
mocked for
his simplicity
thrives on
his connections
with his
family.
In the
context of
tragic optimism
community and
solidarity
remind us
that life's
challenges are
less overwhelming
when we face
them together.
Love has
never been
a popular
movement and
no one's ever
wanted really
to be free.
The world
is held
together.
Really it is
held together
by the love
and the passion
of very few
people.
Yes it's
less rugged
individualist
but even
when everything
feels meaningless
the support
we find in
others can
help us
persevere and
can create
purpose.
It's these
connections that
sustain us in
the face of
adversity not
our rugged
individualism.
Philosophical and
psychological
foundations.
Tragic optimism
finds its
philosophical roots
in existentialism
which is a
school of
thought that
grapples with
life's inherent
absurdity while
still seeking
meaning within
it.
Thinkers like
Albert Camus
and Jean-Paul
Sutt argued
that life is
inherently
chaotic and
without a
predetermined
meaning and
in the end
Evelyn chooses
to embrace
the chaos
finding meaning
in her
relationships and
the small
precious moments
that make
life worth
living.
The act of
trying of
engaging with
life even
when it feels
pointless is
in and of
itself a
form of
rebellion against
nihilism.
It's one of
the most
revolutionary
things you
can do.
Life may be
absurd but that
doesn't mean we
stop trying.
Psychological
resilience.
Psychological
resilience is
another factor of
tragic optimism.
In this context
resilience is
about understanding
that suffering is
inevitable but we
have the ability to
transform it into
growth.
When you're
experiencing something
asking yourself
instead of why is
this happening to
me try what am I
supposed to be
learning from this?
That pushes you
into post-traumatic
growth which is the
idea that individuals
can experience positive
changes after difficult
times.
Back to everything
everywhere all at
once Evelyn's brain
begins to crack as
she is shown different
versions of herself in
other universes and
she starts to succumb
to the chaos.
Her ability to
finally cope with
the multiverse's chaos
comes from her
willingness to not
sit in craving or
aversion but to
embrace the absurdity
instead of yearning
for what she sees as
the more successful
versions of herself or
the version of
herself that was
never married.
She stops resisting
and she leans into
the love that she
has for her family.
Her husband Waymond
is the unsuspecting
hero of the story as
he's already mastered
what it took Evelyn the
whole entire movie
going through hell and
back to find out.
His resilience is not
about avoiding pain
but about confronting
and accepting it
and finding meaning
within both the
suffering and the
mundane.
Rick lacks resilience.
He's undoubtedly the
smartest man in the
universe but his
nihilistic beliefs leave
him emotionally
detached and unable
to cope with life's
hardships in a
healthy way.
Instead he turns into
alcohol destructive
behavior putting his
family in danger
isolating himself even
further.
His inability to
connect with others
and his refusal to
find meaning in
anything leads him to
a place of deep
despair and unhappiness.
Meanwhile Jerry despite
being mocked for his
simplicity demonstrates
the quiet resilience.
His willingness to
try to find joy in the
little things allows him
to live a more fulfilled
life than Rick despite
Rick's intellectual
superiority.
Both Jerry and Waymond
experience a sense of
contentment that comes
not from avoiding
suffering but accepting
it and finding meaning
in those small moments.
To infinity and beyond.
At its heart tragic
optimism is a philosophy
that teaches us to
embrace life's inherent
contradictions.
The suffering alongside
the joy.
The chaos alongside
the meaning.
We can see the
importance of finding
purpose in the small
moments in the
relationship in the
struggles in the
process.
As we continue to
navigate a world filled
with uncertainty with
political instability with
climate change with
existential dread tragic
optimism may be a more
essential mindset for
modern life.
When Dan Harmon the
co-creator of Rick and
Morty was asked if he
agreed with Rick on the
idea that nothing
matters means anything
he said no I do not
because the knowledge
that nothing matters
while accurate gets you
nowhere.
The planet is dying.
The sun is exploding.
The universe is cooling.
Nothing's going to matter.
The further back you pull
away the more that truth
will endure.
But when you zoom in on
earth when you zoom in to
a family when you zoom in
to a human brain and a
childhood and an
experience you see all
these things that matter.
We're at a time and
place where nihilism,
hedonism, apathy often
feel like the easy most
likely answers.
And tragic optimism is a
philosophy that teaches us
that trying still matters.
That you're allowed to
accept the bad while also
still believing the good.
That every moment that we
share with others is an
opportunity.
And that rather than
hungrily searching for
grand sweeping gestures
maybe just maybe meaning is
found in the small
moments.
in the love that we give
and receive in our
relationships, in our
communities.
What if you treated
everyone as if it was the
last time that you were
going to see them and it
was found there?
What if it's found in the
person who waits to hold
the door open for you?
What if it's found in
replaying the song that
makes you think, wow,
this sounds like heaven
at least one more time
before you get out of the
car?
What if it's the biblical
experience that is
everyone singing at the
top of their lungs in
unison at a concert?
What if it's in the belly
laugh of someone you feel
good around?
What if it's roller skating
in the sunshine?
What if it's in the hug
that you let linger for a
few more seconds before
saying goodbye?
What if it's there?
Yeah, well, what are you
going to do?
Life's a bitch and then
you die, right?
Sometimes.
Sometimes life's a bitch
and then you keep living.
Yeah.
It's a nice night, huh?
Yeah.
This is nice.
What if the most radical
revolutionary thing we can
do is be present, give love
and allow ourselves to
receive love while being
aware of the impermanence
of both suffering and joy
and consciously choose to
try?
We're going to continue to
face the complexities of
the future, but I think
that this mindset may offer
us the resilience and hope
that we need to move
forward forthrightly into
it.
I have found that it's not
necessarily about avoiding
suffering or only seeking
joy.
It's about being so
keenly aware of their
existence that you make
the conscious choice to
use them and to create a
life worth living for the
very short amount of time
we are here anyway.
It's like eight minutes in
the grand scheme of things.
I don't think people clock it
enough.
Tiny specks of time.
Here all we get are a few
specks of time where any of
this actually makes any
sense.
Then I will cherish these
few specks of time.
So if this video resonated with
you in any way, then maybe
tragic optimism has something
to offer to you too.
Maybe you've already figured
out that it's not about having
all the answers or denying the
harsh realities of life.
It's about staying present in
the moment, right here, right
now, embracing both the highs
and the lows and finding
meaning and hope in the small
everyday things in the grocery
store trip.
Maybe it's about that.
Can I show you something?
Morty, no offense, but a
drawing of me you made when
you were eight isn't going to
make me feel like less of an
accident.
That out there, that's my
grave.
Wait, what?
On one of our adventures,
Rick and I basically destroyed
the whole world.
So we bailed on that reality
and we came to this one
because in this one, the world
wasn't destroyed.
And in this one, we were
dead.
So we came here and we buried
ourselves and we took their
place.
And every morning summer, I eat
breakfast 20 yards away from
my own rotting corpse.
So you're not my brother?
I'm better than your brother.
I'm a version of your brother
you can trust when he says
don't run.
Nobody exists on purpose.
Nobody belongs anywhere.
Everybody's going to die.
