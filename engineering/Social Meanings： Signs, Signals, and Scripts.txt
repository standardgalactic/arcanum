Sally Haslanger is for professor of philosophy in the department of linguistics and philosophy at
MIT and an affiliate in the MIT Women's and Gender Studies program. Haslanger's works deal
with topics from social and political philosophy, feminist theory and critical race theory using the
tools of contemporary metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of language. She shows that this
is a fruitful combination in her well-known 2012 collection of papers Resisting Reality,
Social Construction and Social Change published by Oxford University Press. More recently, Haslanger
has been working on classical themes from social ontology and social theory, such as social
practices, social structures, social change and ideology, with an eye to identifying and developing
emancipatory perspectives, both in theory and in practice. The title of her talk is Social
Meanings, Signs, Signals and Scripts. So Sally, welcome. The floor is yours.
You're muted, Sally.
Sorry, it's hard once you get the presentation up to find the unmute button. So thank you very much.
I'm sorry about that. It's an honor to be here. Thank you so much. I've really enjoyed all the talks so
far and the questions. I feel like I'm a bit of an interloper because I really do social theory. I don't
do philosophy of action or philosophy of mind or cognitive science or any of those sorts of things.
And so the normative dimension of what I'm going to say is very, very rough and I borrow quite a bit
from Kristen Andrews in doing it. But so it's very drafty what I'm trying to offer and sort of seeing how
these different issues sort of fit together. Okay, so let's see where I am. Here's my outline. I'm going
to have a very brief introduction. I'm going to talk then about social practice structures and systems
so you can see why I'm interested in mind shaping. Then I'm going to talk about social meaning and
signaling and these sorts of things and actually it's going to be about fluency. Then I'll say
a little bit about normativity or my best guess so far about normativity and how it emerges here
and then I'll draw a conclusion. Okay, so let's do the introduction. So patriarchy, white supremacy,
capitalism, cis heteronormativity, ableism, carnism or speciesism where carnism is the ideology that we can
eat and kill and eat animals and treat them and kill them for leather or whatever and other oppressive
systems are exceptionally durable even in the face of pressure to change. So then there's the question
that is really been guiding me for quite a long time is how and why do oppressive systems reproduce
themselves and how can the process of social reproduction be effectively transformed so that
hopefully better systems emerge and in this talk I'm really going to focus on a how and why do the
systems reproduce themselves and more specifically on how social norms contribute to the durability of
oppression. So I'm someone who believes that social niche construction is that you know how to understand
our social lives and there are many different dimensions of the social niche but certainly social
norms are part of it. Okay so this is um if anyone has heard me give a talk before you've probably
heard this so um I apologize for that but it does structure a lot of my thinking. So coordination
happens in social practices um coordination around what I call resources that is things of positive or
negative value is a fundamental human task and our ability to develop flexible forms of coordination
that can be passed down through social learning is the key to our evolutionary success
and I want to include in what we coordinate around negative things like toxic waste or garbage and
such that may seem odd to call it resources but that is what the tradition that I'm part of
has used and so I use that term too sometimes I call them sources instead of resources but oh well
coordination relies on meanings and symbols and default assumptions and associations
that is culture or what I call a cultural technique to shape our behavior we not only learn what is
edible but develop cuisines menus and daily and holiday rituals so here's a cedar wax wing and a cedar
wax wing has a pre-installed module that tells it that it eats little red round things and it will
look for it will try to eat beat little red beads or whatever it doesn't have to learn this from
from its parents or anything where we do have to learn what um what things are edible and what things are
not edible on my account and ideology is a cultural technique gone wrong so it's this these tools that are
part of this toolbox of meaning some bimbals default assumptions it's um it's gone wrong because it obscures or
distorts what is valuable and or organizes us in unjust or harmful ways so any human behavior is
conditioned by multiple factors so let's consider a meal it's constrained by the physical demands of
the human body the geographical context and edible things in it the social political legal context that
makes certain edible salient or available or safe so you know government institutions which make sure
that certain poisonous things can't be included in our food things like that whoops i've lost my clicker
there it is the economic constraints on what we can afford and the social meaning of the different food
stuffs so you know we all know that um what we eat at certain times of day or in certain holiday
rituals and things like that um is really important because that's something that culture teach us
this is you have coffee in the morning when you get up you have in the united states you have turkey
at thanksgiving you know these sorts of things um are are are are very significant um and you know for a
wedding you're you're supposed to have these things and not that at a holiday banquet or a celebratory
banquet you have other things so social meaning um is a an important um factor that conditions are our
behavior so a cultural technique i think of is at this point in my in my thinking about it is just a grab
bag um you know i'm sure that more work could be done to individuals you know make clearer what's in it
but i want to include simple meanings like pink means girl red means stop and other forms of
signaling like greeting rituals do you shake hands or do you bow clothing choices so gendered clothing
choices for example different kinds of logos um default assumptions marriages between one man and one
woman or concepts i think that these default assumptions are often alleged analytic truths about
the concepts i don't believe in analytic truths but i do think that there are these default
assumptions that can be challenged elements of architectural design so toilets designed for men
and women only brick and ivy in the united states especially in new england means an elite ivy league
school facade columns is supposed to connect you to you know the western tradition of greece and our
glorious past um narrative tropes first comes love then comes marriage then comes baby in the baby
carriage carriage and material signs signals prompts um familiar patterns of metaphor and autonomy the pen is
mightier than the sword um entrenched conceptual homologies like reason is to passion as man is to woman
and explicit declarations and coded messages like black lives matter and blue lives matter so what i'm
trying to get at is these are the various parts of culture that we master in order to become uh socially
fluent and so just as they're going to be um bits of it that are kind of semantic so you want to know what
pink means around here there are going to be other things that um are more pragmatic um this is what
uh you assume as a background when you encounter someone who is is marked with this particular signal so
if a girl is if a child or an infant is marked with pink there are certain kinds of and and so that
indicates that it's a girl then there's certain default assumptions are triggered etc etc and the
same is true like architectural design is like a simple meaning it it says this is where where men
or women use the toilet okay so here we are trying to organize we are undifferentiated in along multiple
dimensions so we have to coordinate and so um my account of practices suggests that when we're trying
to coordinate there's the thing in the world that we interpret through various frameworks is it a pet
is it food is it a pelt is it a wild animal and once we opt for a particular social meaning then we
we we develop attitudes um we come to perceive relevant things about it um etc so so so if we're in a
world where um uh the social meaning is that bunnies are food um then we will perceive the bunny as
something to be caught and something to be killed and something to be cooked if that um uh culture if
you move go into a culture where then um bunnies are pets there's going to be a kind of dislocation
a sense of what's going on here because people grow these big fat bunnies and and put them on their
laps and keep them in their homes and you're kind of confused by it um and how we how we
see what could the cultural techne offers us as a way of thinking about the world or experiencing the
world um is reinforced by how we interact with the resources so oops sorry i keep going back um this is
also um connected to whether can you still see me i think i've lost you share the you share the the
screen you share the we can see this okay i thought something happened that was very weird i don't know
what happened is it unshared okay okay here we go um go back to sharing go back to presenting okay there
we are so this you know is this individual a friend a mother or a sex object is this individual a friend
a janitor or a criminal okay so social practices and words are patterns of learned behavior that at
least in the primary instances enable us to coordinate as members of a group in creating
distributing managing maintaining and eliminating a resource or multiple resources due to mutual
responsiveness to each other's behavior and the resources in question as interpreted through these
schemas so notice that learned behavior is a crucial thing here that makes it social um again compared
to the the bird the um you know we learn uh what is edible so this is where mind shaping is going to
start playing a role we social learning is an a crucial part of making something a social practice
as opposed to just an innate disposition
so public meanings are internalized as we learn the languages of our local cultures
this is the basis for our fluency and social skills and capacities for code switching
i share some cultural tools with philosophical colleagues such as all of you across the globe
others with my neighbors and still others with my dog
tools are designed for one purpose and then are used for another purpose
and then are used for another purpose and then are used for another purpose and then are used for
another purpose and then are used for another purpose and then are used for another purpose
so red gets used in all of these different ways and has different meanings it can mean protest
it can mean love it can mean you know aid support etc um and as william sewell says who's a cultural
historian says users of a culture will form a semiotic community in the sense that they will
recognize the same set of oppositions or my term here is meanings and therefore be capable of engaging and
mutually meaningful symbolic action to use the ubiquitous linguistic analogy they'll be capable
of using the grammar i think also the syntax the lexicon etc of the semiotic system to make
understandable utterances so our everyday activities and actions and what we wear and and how we move
through space our embodiment um there is a language for doing that so to speak
so social relations are established in practices so x is the friend of y or the teacher of y or the
parent of y we engage in these practices that are mediated through the cultural techne
structures are networks of relations they consist of places and nodes places in relations or nodes and edges
and the network forms the skeleton of a complex dynamic system and i can talk at length about
complex dynamic systems but that's not my topic for today but i think part of the issue is that these
complex dynamic systems are self-reinforcing so if we want to bring about social change we have to
figure out about how to intervene in them transformative social change occurs when systems no longer
produce the equilibrium um produce the the equilibrium instead positive feedback loops lead to a new
equilibrium and that new equilibrium is sustained homeostatically so to do this to have transformative
social change we need to understand the basins of attraction and tipping points because systems can
accommodate perturbate perturbations and maintain themselves that's the bad side but the good
side is small changes can cascade and make a significant difference so here are these different
equilibrium points so on the left is the bull and so that's going to lots of you can move that ball
a lot and it's not going to make a significant difference it's going to return to the base
equilibrium but if you can change the conditions for the second example then what happens is even a
small change can have a substantial difference and either way you know right or left um and so we're
trying to change the bull to the hilltop um to get social change to happen and then there's an unstable
equilibrium point where you have to push really hard to go one way and a tiny uh tap to go in the other
way uh and so this is like american democracy we're having to push really hard to sustain democracy but a
tiny a tiny push is going to have democracy collapse i think okay positive feedback loops you get the
idea i don't have to go into that so social structures are stable and dynamic our systems are dynamic but
tend to be stable why are they stable well coordination is really important we have to coordinate to survive
and it depends on communication a division of labor and apt usage of the tools provided by the cultural
technique in order to communicate and divide labor without uptake of the cultural technique coordination
falls apart it also is due to intelligibility a cultural technique provides tools to make sense of
ourselves and of others in the world action that conforms to one's place in a social practice is
intelligible to others but if one strays too far one is misinterpreted or punished or viewed as a
questionable member of the community and this is bad right this is for humans not belonging um is
really one of the most upsetting things um that can be done to us and so we're highly motivated to do
what enables us to belong of course i want to talk i want to you know emphasize materiality because in
the social niche practices shape the material conditions in ways that resist change feedback loops
and social needs construction shape our environment to accommodate our practices so i think transportation
systems are a great example it's really hard to change a transportation system once it's in place
and so we are we are shaped to use certain kinds of transportation systems and lose skills about
how to use other ones and it takes a lot to be able to shift that even if we want and need to change
our practices it may not be feasible feasible because it may be just way too expensive um and also power
so practices define rules that come with burdens and benefits this is part of the division of labor
and in doing so they distribute power who has access to the valued stuff who can produce it own it withhold
it and who is burdened with responsibility so here as i mentioned today we're going to talk about social
norms and the cultural techne and i'll say less about materiality and power
so meaning signaling and uptake so what kind of strategy will help us think about
how the cultural techne shapes us right because it's a mind shaping it's a it's happens through the
cultural techne so how does the cultural techne structure our agency so i'm going to begin
with the idea of fluency in a system of signs knowing how to read the signs how to use them to interpret
each other in the environment how to use them as guides to behavior so fluency is a kind of know-how
and so i actually believe that signs are a system of signs are is is a material thing in the world
um and what we do when we so like a language is a material thing in the world has a lot of abstract
um uh structural dimensions but it signs are are material things they're like most of them not all
of them they're they're sequences of letters they are um sounds that come out of our mouths they are
signs that we put on the street and then there's a kind of structure to them that makes them
a system so i suggest that we start by drawing on resources and communication more generally to make
sense of social norms and of course in the bad cases to make sense of ideology semantics or semiotics
relies on a material apparatus of symbols to the sounds inscriptions and meaningful objects and gives
them um a referent or a meaning so here's the terminology of semiotics um i think in some ways it's
more useful than the analytic philosophy of language language uh terminology because it has different
words for sign and signifier so the signifier is like the dog at the bottom and the signified is a
dog you have to imagine that being a real dog rather than a picture of a dog um so dog the signifier
picks out the animal the dog and then the combination of the signified and the signifier is the sign
sign so for althusser and for others you know a semiotics has this apparatus this is going to be
important the signal um and the signal is is the signifier and then it has signification and so becomes
a sign and the signified is the meaning um so here is someone you know the priest holding up the host
that's a little cracker the little cracker is the signifier and what it means is the body of christ
and it is part of a ritual but also part of a system of signs that you know connects this
different things that are signified in relation to each other the meaning of the signifier is what
it picks out it is not in the head so i'm an externalist about semantics it's part of a system
of signs which is the full apparatus of the liturgy we learn the language and become fluent social agents
we learn how to use the language they use the system of signs and the relationship between
signifier and signified is also going to be a potential site of contestation what is the real
meaning of the host is there anything that it corresponds to or is that just fiction is this
system a system we endorse for coordination etc okay so how do you get from signifier to signified
um the standard view is comes from grice meta semantics so it's it's not the semantics it's
how the signified gets its semantic value this is meta semantics so grice
grice says introduces a distinction between not non-natural meaning so dogs means dogs
um and he says of non-natural meaning that a speaker a meant non-naturally something by x
is roughly equivalent to a intended the utterance of x to produce some effect in an audience by means of
the recognition of this intention so note that non-natural meaning requires sophisticated metacognition
it's not plausible that non-human animals can have access to non-natural meaning in the gricean sense
but there's also grice talks about natural meaning so one example is smoke means fire
and the meaning is established through regularity of cause and effect and i think that such meaning
seems to rely simply on an individual's inductive capacities so you see fire and then there's smoke
and you see fire and then there's smoke and they see fire and there's smoke and then you see smoke and
you think oh there must be a fire so it's tempting to think that there's some form of meaning that's less
cognitively demanding than grice's non-natural meaning but more socially demanding than natural meaning
so here is a an idea of meaning or signaling without metacognition
so uh grice you should this is uh from a passage from grice dry says well you know my view is
contrasted with stevenson so grice is going to quote stevenson grice says for something x to mean
non-naturally something y um oh it's not non-naturally uh it's naturally it shouldn't be n and it should
be n so for something x to mean naturally something y speakers have a tendency to produce x and hearers
have a tendency to understand why when speakers want to communicate why to hearers and this pattern is due
to according to stevenson an elaborate process of conditioning attending to the use of sign in
communication so it's just a conditioning process rather than this fancy i intend that you understand
my intention by doing this it's just a conditioning process that's going on um in natural meaning uh grice
has in mind so okay how did that happen okay so brian skerms works on signals um hello hello okay he says
skerm says darwin seems kind of net seems some kind of natural salience operating at the origin of language
at that point signals are not conventional but whether the signal is somehow naturally suited to
convey its content this is the smoke means fire but then there's a kind of further meaning which isn't
just simple you know natural salience or induction um but it involves what stevenson seemed to be
thinking about in terms of conditioning and then so uh skerms goes on signaling is gradually modified by
evolution darwin darwin is thinking of biological evolution but for humans and some other species
there's a version of the account that substitutes cultural evolution or social learning for biological
evolution so what's going to happen here is we can get some kind of meaning that is more than just
you know uh a kind of natural suitedness through induction for smoke means fire but there's a kind of
conditioning that happens um through social learning that enables us to read a signal okay so here's
vervets so vervets are the standard example for um creatures that are non-human that have um culture
and that's what i'm interested here because i think that culture is not something that just humans have
lots and lots and lots of animals have culture in the sense that they socially learn signals um patterns
of behavior scripts and these sorts of things um that enable them to coordinate if they didn't they would
be very easily extinct because climate change and all sorts of other change in the world um uh make it the
case that there has to be resilience and flexibility in animal behavior so an animal coordination so
vervets have distinct alarm calls for different classes of predator a cough for an eagle a bark for
a leopard and a shutter for a snake for each predator a different evasive action is optimal for leopards
it's best to run up the tree and out on a branch where a leopard can't follow for snakes one should stand
tall and scan the ground to locate it and move away for eagles it's best to exit a tree take cover in
the underbrush and look upward to detect the location of the predator and each alarm call
elicits the appropriate behavior so this is the kind of conditioning but it is learned conditioning
so vervets can also learn the calls of burbs birds and respond appropriately to their warnings as
eavedroppers so so what happens is the the vervets learn that when the superb starling makes a certain
call then that means that there's a leopard and so then they give their their um vervet call and
there are also some examples of using these calls deceptively like to get everyone up in the tree
so this is the single signal system the sender sees an eagle and coughs the receiver hears the
cough and runs through the underbrush um etc etc so where am i here um the vervet cough has social
meaning in the vervet group social meaning of this sort does not require sophisticated mental states
and metacognition and neither the carrier of the social meaning that is the signifier fire nor the
information transmitted need be linguistic right it's a cough and it's a leopard right there's nothing
linguistic there if you think of languages as these complex recursive systems nevertheless
information is transmitted specifically information that's relevant to agency and
note that understanding the signal involves knowing what to do what we do what one ought to do
this is part of the question of where normativity comes in
whoopsie no i am okay so normativity my little controllers at the bottom there they are okay
normativity so one way to approach the topic of normativity is to start with a conception of the
psychological requirements i know i'm almost out of time um what does it take for someone to feel the
pressure of a norm or to follow a norm or to follow a norm those are looking at normativity from the
point of view of humans to start with um and this is a human centric because we say look what do i feel
when i'm feeling pressured by norms or when i'm following a norm um but i don't think that this is i think
this is speciesist and i think that we shouldn't take this approach um instead as andrews says this is
kristen andrews rather than defining norms in terms of human psychology it's possible to characterize
normative regularities in a minimally psychological way that presupposes very little about their
underlying mechanism instead focuses on readily operationalized patterns of behavior this approach
would permit researchers to first identify normative regularities and then develop a bottom-up
taxonomy of all the different kinds of psychological processes that bring them about
so very briefly what normative regularities um she suggests are socially maintained patterns of
behavioral conformity within a community and so there's an open question here for example of the
fish um is this pattern sort of uh innately sort of pre-programmed um so when there is a predator then
fish just go into this or did they have to learn it this is an open question um conformity is simply
a pattern of behavior that is statistically common but social maintenance is what makes it a normative
regularity it can come in different forms not just punishment or sanctions but also positive incentives
such as inclusion gains and status success in gaining another common good so
food so an incentive would be we cooperate to get food community is just going to be the relevant
reference cube so socially maintained patterns of behavioral conformity within a community
are the normative regularities they happen all over the place all over the animal world
many argue even in insects and kind of very uh primitive
animals um but this is the beginning and then we say what are the many social and psychological
processes that maintain behavioral conformity conformity within different species
now this next slide looks very complicated i'm not going to go through the whole thing
um so she argues that there are these six different dimensions of normativity there's going to be
whether there's broadly speaking rule following where she doesn't mean just like rule following in a kind of
um kripke wittgenstein sense but just a rule can be provided that patterns um the behavior um behavioral
understanding that is understanding others in conspecifics um when they signal etc um collective agency how
collective is the the participation in this practice what is your motivation is there
punishment is there active pedagogy and she suggests that there are these different levels of
behavioral rules that can be just emergent regularities implicit representations non-propositional
representations etc all the way up to public linguistic representations of rules which is humans
um similarly their behavioral interpretation and prediction of other conspecifics you can have
submentalistic behavior understanding um so some this is is probably the way that um infants and many
animals non-human animals do it but there can be minimal mentalizing so predators will have minimal
mentalizing this is what zewinski calls the teleological stance and then all the way up to humans and
recursive mentalizing um collective agency we can do this just because we all a group of us want the same thing
and we're just pursuing our own self-interest and it ends up that are doing it at the same time is
is productive of something that we want or need um it could be coordinated shared etc is our motivation
immediate self-interest or are we reciprocally reciprocally altruistic um are we concerned about
the reputation do we take it to be intrinsically motivating um what is the kind of punishment just
second person you hurt me and i punch you um third person there's someone else who comes in and says no
you can't do that to them the bystander or is there an institution of punishment and the same of pedagogy
there's going to be sort of selective social toleration so this comes in zawinski's work too so that
i will let you watch me do this and not push you away but that other member of the tribe or the
group or the whatever um i won't let them watch me so i'm just going to let you do it so that you learn
it active feedback etc um institutional teaching so i think that we can say that burvets demonstrate
behavioral regularity such as signaling that is socially maintained but it doesn't seem to involve
explicit representations where it's not even clear it involves implicit representations or metacognition
so on these i think maybe implicit certainly non-propositional and um i think their interpretation
of their this is burvets um learning how to open a box and teaching each other how to open boxes and such
um the there's probably submentalistic understanding of the i mean this is all what we do too to be
honest it's not like they're so different from us we do all this too uh minimal mentalizing uh collective
agency it seems like in the signaling there's coordinated intentionality because one gives the
signal and the other runs away immediate uh self-interest is going to be like you run up the tree because
you have um a self-interest in not being eaten by a leopard but there's a reciprocal um process here
because the signal giver and the signal receiver are reciprocal reciprocally involved and certainly the
parent of the small vervet who is trying to teach the vervet to run up the tree when this call happens
that's going to be reciprocal reciprocally altruistic um there's active feedback active teaching and
correction and punishment there's in some of their activities it seems that there's both second person
and third person punishment so what i want to say about this is that what i think is so valuable about
this approach is that there's this multi-dimensional sort of model so if we go back if i can get back
to that i don't i won't go back to it but you remember the picture there's the picture so the picture
is that you can map different kinds of animals in different kinds of activities as normative in these
you know greater or lesser ways along these multiple dimensions okay almost done if i can get the screen
to work okay conclusion so how and why do oppressive systems reproduce themselves in a social niche an
equilibrium is achieved through the interaction between physical constraints social signals behavioral
affordances power dynamics etc so this is this equilibrium is is well maintained by multiple
feedback loops um between uh our behavior and the material conditions um i focused here on the
cultural technique is it a bucket of signs and signals and strip scripts social fluency in the cultural
technique involves an uptake of these tools for coordination to know what the sign means it's to know how to
act in conformity with it and to do so as a default or at least protanto um sort of dispositions to do it
that way uh because there's a correct and incorrect way to respond to the signal by taking up a system of
signals we become fluent in a normative structure and sophisticated mind reading and propositional
representation is not necessary how can the process of social reproduction be effectively transformed so
that better systems emerge disrupt the equilibrium and among other things we should change our cultural tech day
we should change our material權ố shiny
