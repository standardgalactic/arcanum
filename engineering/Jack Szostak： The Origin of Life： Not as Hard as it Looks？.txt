I'll begin by thanking Laurie and Bengt for inviting me back to speak in this wonderful symposium.
It's a hard act to follow Don, who's given us an amazing overview of the origins of our species.
But what I'd like to do is go back about another thousandfold in time to somewhere around four billion years ago.
When the chemistry of the early Earth was developing and becoming more complex and ultimately giving rise to biology.
So that's a hard thing to study for many reasons, including the fact that we have no actual geological samples of the surface of our planet back then.
So a lot of what I'm going to talk about is a mix of sort of theory and experiments that gives us ideas about how things might have happened.
What we can do is test our ideas.
We can figure out what things don't work and what we're left with, we hope, is a possible path leading from chemistry to biology.
So when I was thinking about how to present all of this, one thing that really struck me, something that's happened again and again,
is that, you know, we see at some point an advance in the field, which usually results from overcoming some preconceptions, some deeply ingrained idea about how things ought to work, which turns out, you know, not to be true.
So it's overcoming those deeply ingrained prejudices, which is really essential for the progress of science.
And what I'd like to do is give you a series of advances from my field, which is the chemistry of the origins of life.
This whole field is actually closely related, surprisingly, to a big part of astronomy, which is the discovery of other solar systems, exoplanets.
We now know that there are, you know, millions, probably billions of other planets, many of which are like the Earth, orbiting other stars.
And that's given rise to a huge hunt for signs of life out there.
I'd just like to ask everybody in the audience here, how many of you, like, really think that there is life out there on other planets?
Just raise your hands if you think there's life out there.
Okay, and how many of you are equally sure that we're the only place that has life?
And I see there are a lot of people like that, too.
So we have these very divergent views, right?
Life, you know, we've seen that it arose here.
It's given rise to this incredible diversity that we see around us.
Some people think that must happen out there.
Other people think, well, it's so, life is so complicated.
Maybe it only got started here.
If we could find another independent origin of life, that would clearly say that it's not so hard to get from chemistry to biology.
But so far, we have only one example.
And so my view is that we don't know.
We can't say.
What we're trying to do in the lab is figure out if there's what looks like an easy path to biology.
But I think it's our friends in astronomy who will perhaps most clearly answer this question.
Okay, let's see.
Okay.
All right.
So, yeah, I wanted to just briefly say, why do so many of us think that life is common in the universe?
So, clearly, one example is there are lots and lots and lots of environments that could support life, right?
We have already in the early days of this adventure over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets, planets orbiting other stars.
And many of those are in the habitable zone where you could have liquid water.
And so it's pretty clear that a lot of these environments out there could support life.
We just don't know if they do.
I think another reason for thinking that life might be common is that there was a lot of time available on our planet for life to get started.
So, in between the time when the Earth had cooled down after the moon-forming impact to the first clear signs of biology,
there's a time span of at least several hundred million years, maybe as much as 700 million years.
And so there was a lot of time for life to get started.
And no matter how hard it is, maybe in the end it was inevitable.
On the other hand, I think what makes a lot of us think that life might be rare and really hard to get started
is that modern life is just so incredibly complicated, right?
So this is part of the metabolic chart.
I mean, every living organism on the planet has thousands of coordinated chemical reactions going on all the time,
catalyzed by incredibly complicated and beautiful enzymes.
But even the informational organization of life is complicated, right?
So from the central dogma of going from information coded in DNA, archived in DNA, transcribed into RNA,
used to code for proteins, which carry out all the reactions of cells,
every part of that system depends on every other part, right?
It's incredibly self-referential.
You can't replicate DNA without help from RNA as primers, protein enzymes that are polymerases
and other parts of the machinery and so on.
Same thing for RNA.
It's coded generally by DNA, but to replicate it or to transcribe it requires proteins and metabolites.
So how could such a self-referential system ever evolve?
There are a lot of crazy theories to account for this, but things didn't get,
progress wasn't really possible until some very smart people like Francis Crick, Leslie Orgel, Carl Loos,
realized in the 60s that it was RNA, that molecule in the middle,
that potentially held the answer.
When the first structures of tRNA came out with its complicated three-dimensional folded shape,
these people realized that maybe RNA could also act like an enzyme,
in which case you have one biopolymer that can both carry hereditary information
and carry out chemical reactions.
And so it became possible to at least think of an earlier, simpler stage of life's history,
where before the evolution of DNA, before the evolution of proteins,
you could imagine simple cells with an RNA genome that was catalyzing its own replication
as well as biochemical functions.
Okay, so that simplifies the problem of how life got started enormously,
but we still have to work out how could the chemistry of the early planet give rise even to structures like this,
which are still quite complicated.
So here is a more detailed view of what we think these early simple cells might have looked like.
We often call them protocells.
They still have a membrane envelope that keeps things together
so that different parts of the system don't just float off into space.
Inside this membrane compartment, we have small bits of genetic material,
which we are pretty sure was RNA or something closely similar to modern RNA,
maybe not identical.
These kinds of structures are actually very easy to assemble in the laboratory,
but the harder part is to imagine how a system like this, a protocell,
could actually grow and divide and replicate its genetic material
before there was any evolved genetic material, right?
We need to go through this stage where we have this self-assembling system
that's complicated enough to actually undergo replication,
but just based on chemistry and physics,
that gives rise to the ability to begin the process of Darwinian evolution,
which can lead to the complexification and diversification that we see around us now.
Okay, so in thinking about how to do the replication of primitive RNA molecules,
I want to begin by mentioning one of the pioneers in this field,
the late Leslie Orgel,
who had been working ever since the late 60s, early 70s,
on how to imagine replication happening without enzymes.
And one of the key insights that Leslie had, out of many,
was the fact that the substrates, the nucleotide molecules
that would be polymerized during the process of replication,
had to be different from what we see in biology today.
So what you see on the top, the nucleoside triphosphates,
are the universal substrates for DNA and RNA replication now,
but they require very sophisticated enzymes
in order to accelerate that polymerization process.
And if you don't have those sophisticated catalysts,
you need molecules more like what you see on the bottom,
those so-called phosphorimidazolides.
These are molecules that are reactive enough
that they can start to polymerize all by themselves
without any help from sophisticated, fancy evolved catalysts.
So that kind of insight gave us our kind of standard view
of how this copy and chemistry ought to work.
And this little video that was made by Janet Owassa
shows how we were thinking about the process.
We'd imagine single strands of RNA floating around
in this chemically very rich environment
filled with activated nucleotides that could find their partners
by Watson-Crick-Franklin-based pairing
and sort of click into place, reacting with the growing chain
and building up a copy, as you see here.
So to look at that in a little bit more detail,
what you can see in the diagram
is that we have a short strand at the top, a primer,
which is growing by copying the template.
And the way we imagine this working
is based on what we know about how this happens in biology.
We imagine a single activated nucleotide
coming in, binding to the template,
the bottom strand next to the primer.
And for those of you who are interested
in the details of the chemistry,
the atomic structure of one of those substrates
is shown at the bottom,
but the schematic version at the top
shows you the essence of it.
So this nucleotide comes in and binds,
the primer attacks, adds one nucleotide
and kicks out the green imidazole moiety
as the leaving group.
And I'll show you an example of an experiment like that.
This is the kind of thing that was pioneered in Leslie's lab.
This is an experiment we did in my lab many years ago.
And it shows the progress of this type
of spontaneous copying chemistry.
No enzymes involved.
So in the gel image
underneath the sequence diagram,
at time zero is the starting material.
After a minute,
you can already see a slower moving band
that represents the primer
where one base has been added.
After a few more minutes,
you see a second base coming in
and then a third base coming in
by five to ten minutes.
So the basic chemistry of copying works,
but there's a puzzle hidden in this experiment.
And if you look closely at the template sequence,
you'll see that there are four Cs,
which Gs can come in and base pair,
making a GC base pair.
But you see in the experiment,
only three of them get copied.
And why is that?
This was a puzzle that was in their literature
for at least 40 years.
And it was just one of those things
that there was no obvious explanation for.
And so it kind of lay there.
Remarkably, really remarkably to me,
in Leslie's lab about 25 years ago,
they did a very clear set of experiments
that showed that when a second nucleotide
binds to the primer,
downstream of the one that's going to react,
it accelerates the reaction.
That second nucleotide is acting as a catalyst.
It just seemed like an incredibly important clue
as to the mechanism of this process.
But that discovery lay there,
unsighted, unseen, unknown,
for almost 25 years,
until a fantastic student in my lab,
Noam Privas,
rediscovered this independently
from his own experiments.
And to me,
this always seems like
a really iconic example
of the fact that
by working hard in the laboratory
for several months,
you can save yourselves
a couple of hours in the library
reading the literature.
So,
we rediscovered this
and we really
tried to get to the bottom of it
to figure out the mechanism
of this catalysis.
And we spent several years on this.
We tried all kinds of things.
Our bias was
that this catalytic effect
was probably some kind
of molecular interaction.
Some part of the second nucleotide
was maybe helping to
pre-organize the structure
of the reactive nucleotide
and to make it, you know,
in the right geometry
for the reaction to go.
But we could never nail that down.
And finally,
a new student came into the lab,
Travis Walton,
and he swore
he would get to the bottom
of this mystery.
And amazingly,
he did.
And what he discovered
was that
the interaction
between these two nucleotides,
the catalyst
and the one that's going to react,
was not,
as we thought,
a non-covalent reaction
involving a change
in geometry,
but actually due to the formation
of a covalent intermediate.
So the process
is diagrammed
on the left
and
the chemical details
are on the right.
But basically what happens
is that
two of these activated nucleotides
react with each other.
They make a strange-looking
dinucleotide
that binds to the template
by two Watson-Crick-base pairs.
So it can bind more tightly,
which means you need less of it,
which is nice.
And
we were able to show later
from structural studies
that that bridge,
that phosphate,
imidazole-phosphate bridge,
is pre-organized
in three-dimensional space
to favor
the chemical reaction
of template copying.
And so I think
what took so long
to make this discovery
was the fact
that we were convinced
that this non-enzymatic copying
ought to work
the same way
as it does in biology.
It just doesn't.
So once we learned about that,
once we got over that barrier,
we were able to
take advantage
of our understanding
of the chemistry
and really learn
how to copy RNA templates
in a much more efficient
and general way.
And that work
is still ongoing.
But this was the key advance.
It came from overcoming
that preconception.
Okay.
Now, I haven't said
anything so far
about where did
these nucleotides come from.
I mean,
these are pretty
complicated molecules.
Why would they be lying around
on the surface
of the early Earth?
And in fact,
30 years ago,
actually,
Jerry Joyce
and Leslie Orgel
summarized
the general feeling
that the way
molecular biologists
were studying the problem
was unrealistic,
to put it mildly.
They called it
the molecular biologist's dream
of some warm little
prebiotic pool
filled with pure,
concentrated,
activated ribonucleotides.
How could that
possibly be?
So,
in fact,
the chemistry
of nucleotide synthesis
at that time
was not very well developed.
And a lot of people
actually came
to the conclusion
that maybe
it was actually
chemically impossible
to get to RNA
in sort of
in one step.
And maybe
there was some
earlier,
more primitive version,
some simpler
genetic material
that would have been
easier to make
and easier to copy
that then later on
evolved into
RNA and DNA.
In the intervening,
that led to
a huge blossoming
of studies
of different
kinds of nucleotides.
A lot of the work
done by one
of the great
chemists of the
preceding century,
Albert Eschenmoser.
But in the end,
nothing as good
as our
ribonucleotides
ever came out.
Still
has left
the problem,
though,
that
in the chemistry
going on,
not in a nice,
clean lab
where everything
is well-controlled.
But in a natural
environment,
it's not going
to lead
to pure
ribonucleotides.
Right?
We are now
pretty sure,
on the basis
of a lot of chemistry
that's been worked
out by many people,
but a lot
by John Sutherland
in the UK,
that the synthesis
of ribonucleotides
is actually
reasonably,
not completely,
but reasonably
well understood.
But it should be
accompanied
by at least
some synthesis
of closely related
materials
like arabinonucleotides,
threonucleotides,
and even
deoxynucleotides.
So any
prebiotic synthesis,
you'd expect
to have some mixture
of these different
nucleotides,
which could then
polymerize
into short chains,
but they'd be
kind of messy,
very heterogeneous.
Right?
And that
doesn't seem
like a good,
very promising
start to something
that could
easily replicate
and actually fold
up into structures
that might begin
to do interesting
catalytic processes.
So this is something
we've been studying
in my lab
over the last 10 years.
I'm just going
to give you
two quick examples
that give us hints
about maybe
how RNA emerged
as the winner
from this primordial
competition
between different
types of nucleotides.
So what we can do
in the lab now,
and a lot of this work
was done by Chris Kim,
Li Jin Zhao,
and others in the lab,
we look at these
other possible
relatives of RNA
and ask,
well, what about
their copying chemistry?
How does it compare?
And if these
other nucleotides
were around,
would it interfere
with the copying
of RNA?
So for example,
if we look at
arabinonucleotides,
which are very close
to ribonucleotides,
there's just one
hydroxyl
that's pointed up
above the sugar ring
instead of down,
we can follow
all the steps
of the reaction,
right?
The activation process,
the formation
of that covalent
dimer intermediate,
the actual reaction
with the primer,
subsequent primer extension.
What we see
is the initial steps
in this case,
the formation
of that intermediate,
it's not really affected,
but the extension
of a primer
with an arabinonucleotide
is slower
than with RNA
and in a competition
experiment,
mostly what you see
is primer extension
with RNA.
Not only that,
but if an arabinonucleotide
is incorporated
into a growing chain,
it's essentially
a termination event.
You can't extend
beyond that.
On the other hand,
if there are arabinonucleotides
in the middle
of a chain,
you can copy over it,
but what you make
is RNA.
Similarly,
with 3O nucleic acids,
where you have
a 4-carbon sugar
instead of a 5-carbon sugar,
they actually look
easier to make,
but here,
every step
on the process
is slower.
So at every step,
RNA is out-competing
this very similar relative.
And yet again,
if you have
these 3O nucleotides
in a template strand,
you can copy over it,
but you're more likely
to make RNA.
And so this has given
rise to the model
that you see here.
We have,
we imagine somehow
a primordial environment
on the surface
of the early Earth
where these different
kinds of nucleotides
have accumulated.
Probably mostly
ribonucleotides,
which make RNA,
but mixed in
all of these
competing species.
They assemble
into these very
heterogeneous mixed strands.
But every now and then,
they can base pair
with each other,
and little bits
of primer extension happen.
And when that happens,
what gets made,
preferentially,
is RNA.
So the idea is,
you keep doing this,
you go through cycles,
what you're going
to end up with
is this messy
early mixture
is going to get
transformed
into strands
of almost
pure,
homogeneous RNA,
just like what we see now.
Okay.
All right.
So we can see
at least bits and pictures
of the pieces
of how to,
from the Sutherland work,
how to make nucleotides
from these experiments,
how they assemble
into the primitive strands
that are RNA.
We know
how to copy them.
What's the next step?
How can you actually
get replication
to work?
So I need to explain
why this
has been such
a difficult problem.
In fact,
it's one of those problems
that was so hard,
we didn't even want
to think about it
for many, many years
because there was
like just no obvious
way around it.
So to explain,
if you have a strand
of RNA
and we want to copy it,
if you have enzymes,
if you have all
the evolved machinery
of biology,
it's no problem.
You can start
at the beginning,
quickly extend,
make your copy
and stop at the end.
But if you don't have
that evolved machinery,
there are all kinds
of problems.
The only way
to start at the beginning
is with a specific primer
that will bind
to the template strand
at the beginning.
But there's no way
to supply a specific
primer sequence,
you know,
in a prebiotic situation
where you don't have
catalysts or any way
to make it.
Even if you can copy
an RNA strand,
if it's above
a certain length,
it gets very hard
to get the strands apart,
even at high temperatures.
It's very difficult.
And furthermore,
as soon as the temperature
goes back down
to a point where
base comparing can happen
and copying chemistry
can happen,
these complementary strands
come back together
thousands of times faster
than the chemistry
that is required
to copy a template strand.
So it just looks impossible
when you view it this way.
There are other problems
as well.
I already showed you
an example of what
we used to call
the last base addition problem.
Now we understand
why it's so hard
to add that last base
because the two nucleotide
real substrate
can only bind very weakly
by one nucleotide.
So that reaction
is incredibly slow.
And, you know,
there are other problems.
If you start in the middle,
then you lose the information
from the beginning,
and that's going to happen
on both strands.
And so replication
looked very difficult.
So we've all been through
a difficult time
with the COVID pandemic.
For those of us
who do laboratory work,
it was a tough period
because the labs
were all shut down.
We couldn't go in.
We couldn't do our experiments.
We had to just stay home.
All we could do
is stay home and think,
which turned out
to be a good thing
in this case.
We could still talk
to each other,
you know, by Zoom.
And so in the middle
of the pandemic,
through conversations
with people in my lab,
we came up with a theory,
a model for how
to do replication
in a way that we think
actually solves
all of the problems
that I just showed you.
So we call this model
the virtual circular genome model.
The reason for that
is we imagine the genome
of a primordial cell
being circular.
That's illustrated
by the green circle
in the center.
But it's not,
there are no circular molecules.
All we need to have
are small pieces,
short oligos,
that map
to a circular sequence,
right,
in lots of overlapping combinations
from both strands.
Okay, so
why is that so great,
you might be wondering?
Well,
the idea is
that since you have
little bits and pieces
of this circular sequence
from both strands,
they can come together.
Wherever they overlap,
have complementary sequences,
you have the possibility
of extending those primers
by the kind of primer
extension chemistry
that I showed you earlier.
So these complementary fragments
can come together
in lots and lots
of different ways.
And some of them
will allow for a bit
of copying chemistry
to go on.
Others will not.
But if you cycle
the process through,
you can eventually
copy in little bits
and pieces
all the way around
the circle.
So by iterating
that process,
we think that it should
actually be possible
to replicate
the entire circular sequence
but not like it happens
in biology
where you begin
at the beginning
and go to the end
and then stop
but in a distributed way,
totally different,
that then we imagine
quickly evolved
once you had
catalytic machinery
into a more efficient
mechanism
like we see
in modern biology.
Okay, so
just to point out again
that when these complementary pieces
are allowed
to anneal with each other,
they can do it
in lots and lots
and lots of different
configurations.
In fact,
this is one thing
that makes it very hard
to model this kind
of process.
Even for a very small
sequence,
there are hundreds
or thousands
of small subfragments.
They can come together
in millions
of different ways
and so figuring out
all of the necessary
interactions
is a little bit complicated
but we're working on that
and collaborating
with some very clever people
in particular
Arvind Murrigan
in the physics department
at UChicago
is helping us
try to understand
this complicated system
but we think
that by cycling
the environment
you can repeat
this process
of doing little bits
and pieces of copying
that will eventually
give rise to replication.
So that's shown here.
We have a cycle.
every time
the environmental conditions
allow these short pieces
to come apart
then the conditions change
to allow base pairing
they come together
in different configurations
that allows
in different places
little bits of copying
chemistry
to go on.
So a lot of what
we're doing in the lab
now is trying
to experimentally test
this model
and actually
demonstrate replication
in the lab.
So we'll have to see
how that goes
over the next couple
of years.
Okay.
I want to tell you
another
actually interesting
little anecdote
of where we faced
a problem
that really looked like
it was a very
hard to get
overstep
in imagining
how this copying
chemistry could work.
So again
the schematic
of how this works
is shown at the top
the chemical details
are shown
at the bottom
of the slide
but here's the puzzle
we have these
activated nucleotides
they react
with each other
to make this
bridged
dinucleotide
that's the real
substrate
for template
copying
but that reaction
is reversible.
Okay.
And the equilibrium
of that reaction
is actually
towards the monomers
which are not
good for replication.
The amount
of material
that gets made
at equilibrium
that can drive
copying
is pretty small.
Okay.
So
it's an equilibrium
process
what can you do?
Right.
Is there any way
to make this
whole thing
work better
to make more
of the molecule
that we need
to do copying?
And of course
there is
you know
if you think
about non-equilibrium
chemistry
it turns out
we've actually
found two ways
to shift the equilibrium
in the direction
that we want.
One is a chemical
process that we
actually don't
really understand
so I'm not going
to talk about it.
The other is
well
you see
the products
there are two
products right
there's the bridge
material
that we want
and then
there's that
leaving group
that little
green bit
the imidazole
if we can get
rid of that
we could shift
the equilibrium
this is something
that we're working
on
we imagine
this working
inside protocells
membrane compartments
if we
allow
mononucleotides
activated nucleotides
to diffuse
in
to this
compartment
we'll get
a little bit
of
the reactive
dinucleotide
that we want
but if we
can wash
out
that
imidazole
leaving group
we can shift
the equilibrium
all the way
towards making
the actual
important substrate
for template copying
and that should
make template copying
go faster
at lower
concentrations
and we know
from other
experiments
much more
accurately
so this is
something we
have hints
that this can
work
we're trying
to work out
a way
to actually
demonstrate this
which hopefully
will lead to
an understanding
of how this
could actually
happen
in a natural
scenario
okay
so these are
the kinds
of little bits
of stepwise
pieces
how we have
to overcome
one puzzle
at a time
to try to
build up
an overall
picture of
how to go
from simple
chemistry
to the ability
to copy
and actually
amplify
genetic materials
okay
so what
kinds of
environments
on the early
earth
could support
chemistry
like this
we need
to be
on the surface
because a lot
of the steps
in nucleotide
synthesis
are photochemical
we need
energy
from the
sun
from ultraviolet
radiation
to drive
a lot
of these
processes
we want
an environment
that we're
pretty sure
is not
steady
but is
dynamic
and cycling
and fluctuating
all the time
to drive
the cycle
of protocell
growth and division
and so
environments like
that we can
actually see
and visit
on the
earth today
volcanically active
areas like
this is a picture
of Yellowstone Lake
in the western
United States
there are many
other regions
that we think
have similar
kinds of surface
chemistry
would be
in areas
after a large
impact
on the early
earth
these environments
are nice
because they
allow us
to think
about how
to both
make
and assemble
the feedstocks
the starting
materials
of which
ironically
we now
think
that cyanide
is the key
ingredient
for building
life
cyanide
is made
in the
atmosphere
it can
come to
the surface
in rain
but is a
very dilute
solution
and if you
have cyanide
in water
at low
concentration
like when it
goes into
the ocean
it's just
going to
hydrolyze
by reacting
with water
in order
to use
cyanide
to build
up the
building
blocks
of life
it has
to be
concentrated
which has
to happen
on the
surface
and there's
a fantastic
way
that that
could happen
and this
comes from
insights
from
John Sutherland
my colleague
Dimitar
Sassilov
and John
Grotzinger
the idea
is that
in a
volcanic
or impact
crater
area
you have
hydrothermal
circulation
of water
through the
rocks
which brings
up ions
including
iron
into
ponds
or lakes
on the
surface
and iron
reacts
strongly
and
instantaneously
with cyanide
to make
very stable
complexes
called
ferrocyanide
and as
these lakes
periodically
evaporate
you could
build up
a reservoir
of cyanide
held in
this stable
ferrocyanide
intermediate
and then
again if you're
in a volcanic
area
lava flows
will come
over this
thermally
process
these chemicals
and release
concentrated
cyanide
ammonia
cyanamide
all the
reactive
starting materials
that we need
to build up
sugars
amino acids
and nucleotides
and then
when they come
to the surface
as rainwater
leaches
these things
out
and through
the groundwater
and up
through springs
they can
flow
for example
over
this is a
terraced outflow
again in
Yellowstone
be exposed
to ultraviolet
light
undergo
chemical
transformations
intermediates
like here
one of the
key intermediates
in the
synthesis
of nucleotides
tends
to crystallize
out
another opportunity
to build up
a reservoir
of a key
intermediate
as a crystalline
reservoir
and again
contaminants
side products
byproducts
can get washed
away
and it's
this kind
of thinking
about how
to
get away
from the
idea
of this
primordial
soup
where everything's
just all
mixed up
together
right
to the new
way of thinking
which is
that you build
up reservoirs
you undergo
a few steps
make a new
reservoir
of the next
key intermediate
that can get
purified
and in that
way
you can build
up at least
an idea
a model
of how
these complicated
transformations
could actually
occur in realistic
geological settings
okay
so
the way we're
thinking about it
now
just to summarize
is that we have
we imagine
very primitive
cells
protocells
whose growth
and division
and internal
replication
are driven
by the
environment
in modern life
of course
all these
processes
are internally
controlled
by highly
evolved
sophisticated
machinery
protein
enzymes
but in a
primitive
situation
we imagine
the environment
is responsible
for driving
a cycle
and so
here's one
idea of how
something like
that could happen
you have protocells
in a pond
you have hydrothermal
vents releasing
streams of hot water
which we see today
in lakes like
Yellowstone
get caught up
in a stream
of hot water
these short
fragments of
RNA can come
apart
the protocell
gets swept out
into cold
lake water
things come
together again
little bits
of copying
chemistry
you iterate
that cycle
you can do
replication
and that
sets the stage
for the beginning
of Darwinian
evolution
which would allow
for the emergence
of the first
RNA enzymes
which can drive
better replication
allow you to have
a longer genome
that can encode
more functions
and so on
and so forth
to a more
and more complicated
and more well adapted
primitive cells
and eventually
over some unknown
period of time
we see the evolution
of metabolism
of energy
transducing machinery
complicated membrane
structures
the origins
of protein synthesis
and so on
which sets again
the stage
for the evolution
to the last universal
common ancestor
of life
which was already
as complex
as a modern bacterium
and then on
to us
okay so
again just to
study I think
from all of these
this long history
of theory
and laboratory experiments
one of the things
that strikes me
as the most important
is keeping an open mind
and being ready
to abandon
your preconceptions
and think of
a new way
that things might
actually work
and I think
that's happened
enough times
that we're starting
we're just starting
now to see
the outlines
of a coherent pathway
going all the way
from the chemistry
of the early earth
up to the beginnings
of biology
okay
so
just wanted to mention
I've just finished
writing a book
with Mario Livio
who's a
fantastic
astronomer
and if
any of you
are interested
in learning
more about
the details
of that process
you can find
it in this book
which will come
out this fall
and so
with that
I'd like to
thank you all
for listening
and thanks
again for the
opportunity
Laurie
to speak here
thank you
thanks
fantastic
fantastic
good
thank you
