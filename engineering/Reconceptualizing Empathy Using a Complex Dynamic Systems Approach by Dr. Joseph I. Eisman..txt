have started recording. I hope so. Okay.
Hello and welcome to our very first webinar of the academic year featuring Joseph Eisman,
who has also contributed to the growth of our SIG incredibly for many years.
My name is Hande Fenerci and I'm a doctoral student at Virginia Tech and the co-senior graduate student
representative for the complexity theories in education SIG. The purpose of the SIG is to apply,
advance and extend complexity theories to inquiry, research, theory and practice in a variety of
educational contexts. And in the meantime, hold on, please. I will start accepting participants.
Yep. Joey is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of
Education and an adjunct assistant professor at the College of Education and Human Development at
Temple University. His research explores the relationships between empathy, emotion, motivation,
identity and creativity in educational contexts using complex dynamic systems theories.
Joey received his PhD at Temple University and he holds an MA from Teachers College Columbia University
and BS from the University of Michigan. Joey will deliver his presentation with an opportunity for
a question and answer session. Please join me in welcoming Joey.
It's funny now to be on the other side where I'm now presenting. Thank you so much for having me.
Thank you all for welcoming back into the SIG in this way. It's funny to think about the language
that's being used from explorer to experts and I definitely want to highlight I still I'm very much on the
explorer side of that language of that identity. I'm going to share my screen. Can you just let me know if you can see my screen?
Wonderful. Thank you.
So I'm very excited to be here with all of you presenting this research and to kind of kick off
the work that both the co-chairs Hyundai, Ali and Yasmeen have been working on and and to kind of give
you a glimpse into some of the work that I've been working on recently especially in relation to my
dissertation work. This actually what I'm presenting is a portion of the dissertation study and which
proposed a novel approach to conceptualizing but also measuring empathy. That work I wanted to acknowledge
Avi who's on the call was my advisor is my advisor and that never goes away. I'm always going to be
I'm always going to have the identity. So a lot of this work has been inspired by and informed by a
lot of his ideas and also Dr. Joanna Garner who's also a member of the SIG and a lot of the a lot of the
ideas that we're going to talk I'm going to I'm going to try and talk about is really empathy and education.
Generally empathy is really associated with many positive outcomes.
It enhances teacher education teacher and student relationships we know that can improve student
academic outcomes teaching quality and a lot more. But as you're going to come to see or hopefully I'll
do my best to present this this important construct which is often touted in things like education policy
and administrators encourage their teachers to be more empathetic. We don't really describe it well.
We don't really describe or measure the authentic empathetic experience. So this led me to suggest
a reconceptualization of empathy through a complex dynamic systems lens. The
the talk today I'll briefly introduce empathy constructs and measures then highlight the value
of complex dynamic systems as the guiding approach then introduce a theoretical framework that I guided the
entire conceptualization of empathy that of course is the DSMRI the dynamic system model of broad identity
and finally I'm going to describe a an application of this approach which constituted a portion of my
of my dissertation study. So really we know that there's many ways to describe empathy
and recognizing as many definitions and constructs which you can see here on the screen
we have this um we these are all subsumed under the umbrella of this thing that we call empathy
and there's many different ways that we can splice and dice this term but we also know that oftentimes
there these measures these constructs align with similar phenomenological experiences which can cause
jangle fallacies and for example you can see that there are two major overlapping phenomenological
experiences that often um are the focus of empathy literature there's the inferring what another
person thinks or feels we often refer to that as the cognitive forms of empathy and then there's the
feeling what another person feels which is often referred to as the affective forms of empathy it's
important to acknowledge that there are other major forms but these are the two that have really guided
most of the contemporary research in fact when we look at the measures of empathy we often see that
they're also um looking to measure latent constructs like cognitive empathy and affective empathy
and here's an example of one of the more common survey materials that is used for the past 40 plus
years and you can see that it's looking at cognitive empathy affective empathy as latent constructs
there are subscales there's uh example items you can see here and these are from the interpersonal
reactivity index which really has been king um in these in the empathy survey world but these are
just one way to look at empathy another major way also uh survey is pictorially we see a lot of
different surveys looking using imagery or metaphor to try and interrogate someone's empathic experience
so here we have what's called the inclusion of the other and self or it's highlighting a very specific
form of cognitive empathy that's called self other overlap and um visually that's really just how much
do you feel interconnected or similar to another person so you could be closer to letter a in this
example it's about yourself and a homeless person very far apart or maybe your g where you share a lot
of overlap and that signifies one of the ways we might try and capture this thing that we call empathy
but as we come to see truth is that even though we know we aim to capture these major phenomena really
we're just capturing um one of these components and therefore we can never wholly capture the authentic
empathy experience which we know is dynamic complex and i think really important to this research is
situated in a role let me give you some examples of what i mean by that so here are three different
roles that someone might have a teacher a parent or a physician um and for example we can anticipate
that the way that a teacher empathizes with their students is different from the way that another
person let's say a parent empathizes with their children those two different forms of empathy look
different and are associated with different actions and beliefs and goals and self-perceptions different
emotional experiences and what is expected in one is not expected in another similarly when we look
when we think about something like physician empathy which has a long um definition has a very stable
definition in the physician empathy literature is often there is where we uh excuse me is where medical
students are encouraged to take on more of the cognitive forms of empathy over the affective or to say
differently physicians are taught to try and understand their patients but not to really feel what their
patients are feeling which does make some sense because we know that affective empathy is often
associated with worse prognoses diagnosis and treatment plans so creating some of this distancing can be
helpful so here we can actually identify that empathy is shifting within set of a role so when we look at
that capturing empathy we have to be specific to it's and acknowledge it is context sensitive it is
dynamic and it does shift moment to moment but this is a challenge because normally when we look at the
major ways in which we capture empathy we look at it through traditional component dominant systems
let's think back to the interpersonal activity index that was that survey first introduced with cognitive empathy and
affective empathy and affective empathy and in this example we um we can we understand that there are
latent variables and manifest variables and that they have these linear uh directionality behind them
and that we're looking at how do these things interact but the truth is to really interrogate them
appropriately we can't use this component dominant system we have to use an interaction dominant system
which is what you see here on the right so let's go through why we're talking about complexity and why
i think this is useful so we know as many of us who are familiar with complexity that um these
approaches are flexible adaptable and that they're um they're more they're able to capture the more of
the complex social phenomenon like empathy and which which allows us to see things from a non-linear
perspective going back to that previous component dominant system this linear this approach so this also
makes sense because empathy is not linear it is non-linear actually um and what that means is that
a change to a system may result in unproportional outcome so we know actually that empathy has
non-linear consequences as an example in a recent paper by aldrup et al they suggested that and i'll
quote them both low and extremely high levels of teacher empathy might be problematic potentially
uh potentially causing a non-linear relationship with the called quality of teacher student interactions
and student outcomes or to say it differently teacher empathy is not always going up or down
low levels of teacher empathy or high levels of teacher empathy may actually be just as as a
negative to the student teacher relationship um sorry uh high levels of teacher empathy may be just as
as impactful negatively to the teacher student relationship as would a low level so this is of
course non-linear in that way and when we look at this non-linearity we're also acknowledging the
interaction between these components these were metaphorically in this example here these are like
the little dots so they're dynamic and that means that they are um interacting uh over time and that
they're interdependent which acknowledges that components of the system are assumed to be
interconnected and therefore they influence each other so when we're looking at all these components
we're then looking what's the macro level emergence or to say it differently we're looking to see what
is the appearance of a complex behavior that develops from these interacting dynamic components in the
system and that when we look at what we look at at this higher level is not um is is irreducible which
is to say um this system is nested and is more than some of its parts and this is really important
because what i'm trying to highlight here is that traditional empathy literature has focused on
this linear approach which is focused on um simple components is often neglecting certain
constructs over others and we're missing the whole picture and this is not useful if we really care
about the entire authentic experience of what we call empathy acknowledging the complexity the dynamics
and the role situatedness of the empathic experience i'm encouraging us to then shift our focus
and then use a different approach this is a complex dynamic systems approach one that is grounded in
the dynamic systems model of role identity the dsmri here's a schematic representation of the dsmri
the dsmri for those who are not familiar is grounded in complex dynamic systems ontologies and is a
metatheorical framework that conceptualizes action as emergent from a person's socioculturally constructed
and context dependent role identity that's the idiosyncratic way of taking up a role and for our
example and most of the people on this call it's really that of a teacher like what is the teacher's
role or the role identity or their teacher role and this framework really stands in contrast to those
traditional approaches i showed you earlier and can highlight the way that we can integrate the many
different constructs of empathy into one single framework this is really impactful because we
can then start to highlight how the dsmri um can capture the entirety of the authentic experience let
me show you how and what i mean by that so we start to focus on the contents or the four role related
factors that are interdependent and these four related factors what what we call the content are
someone's ontological beliefs or epistemological beliefs those are referring to knowledge beliefs
and assumptions that they have about the world their or the level of certainty about those
or credibility which is the epistemological purposes and goals are um a purpose a person's purpose or
their um for action or their goals objectives in reference in their role self-perceptions or self-definitions
are rough our self-references uh uh in relation to a role things like self-efficacy perceived values
interests abilities etc and finally we have perceived action possibilities which are internal and external
behavior in relation to a role so let's put this now in the language of the dsmri with empathy so we know
that a person can have an ontological belief that is empathetic that um they may have a belief about
emotional experience or a teacher can have a goal to be more empathetic they can consider action
possibilities that are viewed as more empathetic for example trying to take someone's perspective
that traditional getting someone's shoes and finally a person can have a self-perception
that they themselves are empathetic now we also not only are interested in these different components
of the dsmri the contents but also the structures and these are a reference to the relationships
between the contents often referring to attention or alignment between and within contents so that in
the dsmri uniquely can capture the emergence of these empathic informed actions and affective experiences
at this level as well so not only are we asking well is that is that empath empathetic goal
um present but maybe does empathy emerge when there's alignment between a goal and a belief
or does it not emerge when there's tension between an action possibility and a self-perception
for example and you'll see me by the way use these these lines that are it's gonna be double-headed
errors again you can see me use them in green in reference to alignment or right when it's intention
and finally with the dsmri we also have the processes which is reference to changes in the content of the
structures that i just mentioned but all this of course is being framed inside of a person's control
parameters so the and these are also empathetic in in content or in in perception so for example a
person's context might determine the type of empathy that they may show the domain might also in inform
them for example in the teacher empathy world we might suggest that uh the type of empathy that a
math teacher has versus associate's teacher might change the cultural immediate means and what is
normally empathetic might also be uh nor uh might shift and finally the person's own personal dispositions
and what is their own dispositional levels of empathy as well so this is my call to suggest
that the dsmri can function well for capturing the entire authentic empathy experience by integrating
all these different components simultaneously to show this i'm going to show you an example this is
just a taste of some of the work that came out of my dissertation and i'm going to show you an example
um that was really highlighting how you can use the dsmri to unpack but more importantly to show the
entirety of empathy emerging from someone's goals beliefs perceived action possibilities and self
perceptions so in this example i'm going to show you data the data for here is only going to be two
pieces of data it is a life story and narrative inquiry interview which is where i asked the teacher to
reflect upon emotional experiences while teaching or tell me about how they became a teacher and then
also a video stimulated recall interview where the teacher in my in the study explicated their actions
and decisions during recorded video segment of their class the two teachers in this uh in this uh uh study
were uh purposely sampled and both taught the same school i'm going to introduce you to kevin
and kelly who taught at windsor tech um windsor tech is a vocational school in the mid-atlantic united states
that primarily serves um students from marginalized identities and kevin identifies as white and male
and is a veteran english language arts teacher who's been teaching in that school for a long time
uh by contrast we have kelly kelly is a multi-racial female who is both a science teacher at the school
and also fulfills the role as the athletic director and we're going to focus on their experiences and to
really highlight their story i'm going to introduce you to a very specific form of empathy that comes out
the work of dr hunter gelback from gelback and mu in 2023 where they were looking at social perspective
taking um which i will argue is a form of empathy where you are trying to understand someone's
experiences and there's two different ways that uh that a person can engage in social perspective
taking according to their paper one is that of a judge and the judge makes assumptions you're judging
someone about existing knowledge which does have an available heuristic if you want to make quick
assumptions about people in value of keeping resources time etc and then we have a detective
the detective seeks out information and is a more costly uh job but is perceived by many as being maybe
a little more adaptive because you are then learning what is actually true and operationalizing these two
inside the dsmri we have the detective is part of the action possibilities so seeking information
i'm going to generally refer to as an action possibility and the judge is generally as an
ontological belief because there's assumptions being made and their belief systems are are um excuse me
and they are then believing things about their students so let me first start with kevin kevin
is our judge and his empathetic judging ontological beliefs we saw alignment across his identity
system so as an example and you're going to see me use color here so the color and the quote will
match the color that you're going to see in the dsmri schematic so for example that whole quote is blue
which is the ontological belief and once again the green double arrows are alignments just to
kind of keep everyone on the same track so he said the students at windsor tech his school come from
all over the city but many from the windsor tech neighborhood many from difficult circumstances
many of the students face tremendous hardships and most have experienced a wide range of traumas
this is an ontological belief that kevin has told us and from from the interview he has made clear
this is something that he believes but doesn't always have the uh knowledge to back that up he
doesn't actually seek out information from his students he's making many assumptions about them
but we see here that his judging his empathetic judging carries through and is shows alignment with
inside of his identity system on the whole so as another example here he talks about where he lowers his
standards to help us feel his students feel better and this is a direct um response to his beliefs about
his students having hardships in their life so for example as an action possibility he talks he says if
providing a snack of success by giving good grades moves the needle just a tiny bit with their own self
image with their own who they are with their own way they feel about themselves he then says as a
self-perception and as a goal i'm one million percent down so we can see here that kevin is highlighting
how his beliefs by the students has led to new action possibilities and knew what is perceived as
empathetic actions beliefs goals and self-perceptions that are in favor of making students feel better
so he's using this knowledge to inform everything else this is not what's going on with kelly kelly is
quite the opposite while kevin is comfortable making these assumptions kelly does not have that same
comfort and while i don't have it here i can tell you that this comes from her own experiences where she
made assumptions about students in the past and as a process changed her her actions and started to
become a detective that is once again where she seeks out information so we can see here as an action
possibility and a goal she says explicitly in reference to seeking information she says in
terms of that for parents i was like hey is there anything i should know that will help me become a
better teacher for your child and then we can see here that in response to that she has an ontological
belief about what her parents tell her excuse me what the parents tell her they say and sometimes
they do open up a lot of times it's like i've had things like oh please know that my son or my
child really likes to move around so once again she's using her detective uh action possibilities
which is an empathetic experience an empathetic action possibility align with the goal and align with
this new um uh uh belief excuse me and then we also see her explicitly talk about how this is part of
both a goal and then also a perceived action possibly um we also see this once again is now an action
possibility and a self-perception so she says i tried to let them know i.e her students if i do not
know your circumstance i cannot afford you the extra grace let's compare now for a moment kevin said i'm
gonna make assumptions and then give my students grace kelly has now telling us i will give my students that
grace when i learn something about them to afford them that grace and that is a different form of
empathy where she's still learning about information she's still creating mental models learning about
them and showing empathy but only where when it becomes appropriate based on what she can what she
now knows so when we look at their data together we can see that kevin is our judge and kelly is our
detective now with the time i have remaining um i'm going to try and show you the way that we then
conceptualize this work um using state space landscapes and once again want to thank avi for
your help in helping me get through this so the first part was we found a set of themes across our
data the major themes were self-perceived familiarity responsive action possibility flexibility goal and
action possibility so specifically self-perceived familiarity refers to familiarity with students
lived experiences cultural knowledge ethno-racial views and personal lives how familiar am i with my
students responsiveness as an action possibility is indicates the warmth or adaptability with this to
the students needs um and then finally flexibility refers to how accommodating am i to my students
um am i so low flexibility would be i really hold my students accountable to do things or high
flexibility would be i really give my students grace so to demonstrate these three um uh emergent themes
we then looked at them and re uh interpret them as dimensions across state space landscapes so i'm going
to walk through these three excuse me how we how to interpret or how we read these together i'm going to show
the flexibility one which once again refers to um how flexible were you were you more accommodating or
or were you more holding students accountable so states-based landscapes for those who are not
familiar are a visualization that um we can you can use to to conceptualize our qualitative data and
their conceptual models that are often used in complex dynamic system approaches that describe all
possible states patterns of a system so in it we look for things like conceptually we look for things
like hills so hills represent unstable repellor states so unstable instability while a valley refers to um
uh sorry a valley is uh requires energy to move out of and is often it refers to an attractor state
um so if we see if we see a lot of uh if we see a valley it's harder to move out of a valley so think
kind of like conceptually i'll show you here with the ball imagine the ball is representative of a person
you have flexibility are they low meaning high which you can see in the bottom there and then you have
energy so if a person has is in a is in a state where they are on a high hill this we refer to once again
as a repeller state and it takes very little energy think back to physics to to move from there so you
and so we're thinking kinetic potential energy so this is unstable state and the ball wants to move
somewhere and if it moves down this way it moves into a uh into a valley or an attractor state and it's
much harder to move out of an attractor state once you're in an attractor state so it takes more energy to
move out um to now demonstrate how we then look to this once again as a reminder we're looking at
flexibility responsiveness and then familiarity familiarity does not exist in x y access familiarity
you're going to see actually as a color scheme so pink is more is low familiarity with students
lived experiences and high familiarity is blue and of course the x sorry the y access is energy so how
easy is it to move conceptually out of this space so kevin kevin once again was our judge he felt
comfortable making assumptions about students and when we look at his identity landscape it's clear
that he that with this alignment in his identity landscape he had a very comfortable uh stable identity
system um we can see here that he had high responsiveness to his students really high flexibility
because he was well he's willing to give them grace no matter what and but even though he had low
familiarity he did not know their circumstances he was making assumptions about them and and we from
his uh stable identity system and alignment across identity system he was going to be stable now that's
not the true it's not true for kelly kelly conceptually when she does not know something about a student
she seeks it out once again she's our detective so we as an example here we have kelly when she
conceptually is in uh misalignment here or having tension across her role identity system we can see
that she is now in a repeller state that's the that's the hill there and she has low familiarity with
her students lived experiences but when she seeks them out we can see that she has identity alignment
across her identity system and she now with inside the high familiarity is in a more stable identity
space and if you look carefully you can see on the flexibility at the bottom she moving from like a
medium low medium to high medium which is to say unlike kevin who is willing to give the grace kelly is
not as willing to give the grace unless she now knows anything about her students and has sought out
information that she then uses um to give to be more empathetic in the way that made sense to her
that's all to say i believe the dsmri as uh as a complex dynamic systems approach and framework is
an appropriate and proper way to capture the the entire authentic empathy empathetic experience
it embeds all the different constructs i mentioned earlier which oftentimes traditional approaches will
neglect or prioritize one over many instead here we can integrate all of the many into into a single
framework look at them as a set of goals actions uh for self-perceptions and beliefs and by doing so
we can more appropriately and effectively capture the entire whole empathetic experience and as i end i
just want to say that um as someone who's been looking at complexity for a while and has only since
really feels like i've found my space in it i just want to highlight that the people who brought me to
systems theories first we have a fourth book forthcoming book coming out on the topic of
relationships of power and systems theories in creativity research with a focus on gregory bateson
both as a case study on his life and also his work and for many of us who are familiar with
cybernetics research and gregory bateson um there's a strong tie to our work i'm in his and with that
i want to say thank you i'm happy to answer any questions you may have thank you for this rich
presentation joey thank you um so uh first i would like to start asking by uh your struggles you've
experienced during your studies before you started before you explored complexity complex dynamic
systems framework to study empathy did you do any quantitative analysis yeah what were what were the
other approaches you have so i've i've have used the interpersonal activity index um that survey i talked
about at the beginning it is still prominent it has been readapted in many different spaces and is
still used today in fact there is a there is an adapted version for teachers specifically it's been
rewritten and um my feeling is that it it doesn't really give us everything and of course as we know
surveyed material is neglect context uses aggregate uh experiences so instead of looking at one
specific situated moment in one role it's often look having a person reflect on the entirety of
their experiences which also only gives us a glimpse into what's going on because they're pulling from
potentially only a handful of experiences that are most salient to them um the approaches that i'm
encouraging of course are more situated in the moment with people um in their experiences and the
other things i've seen with regard to empathy research is when you look at other survey material we do see a
lot more um visual pieces there's a lot of different ways in which people have used affective and
cognitive empathy um survey material to try and capture different people and groups perceptions and
then also there is some people have looked at or tried to look at observation data which i think is also
a bit complicated because empathy is such an internal experience even though there is a relational component
um it can be quite difficult so that's why i have shifted in my understanding of empathy to suggest that
complexity really is the only way that makes sense to me at least when trying to understand how to
really capture the social phenomenon when i really do care about it meaningfully and instead of trying
to say well this one very specific component and neglecting everything else that's the thing that
matters the most and i just i just don't believe that's true anymore or ever really thank you thank you
yes may i ask something um please thank you very much that that is a very comprehensive and well
thought out presentation and you made it very clear thank you so much for that and i can certainly see
where complex dynamic systems applies um and enriches our understanding of empathy i wish you would use
empathic instead of empathetic but i'm losing that i'm losing that battle just a linguistic anomaly
um the my question has to do with kelly you said and it was a wonderful question that she would speak to
the parents i believe you said of the children that she was teaching to ask what they would um suggest
she know about their child what a wonderful question um but you also said that uh not everybody had an
answer for that i believe that you said that not all parents answered the question did i miss that
you're looking puzzled she i don't recall saying that she she did not mention that what what she does at
the beginning of the year is she speaks with parents gathers information in multiple modes so for
multiple modes so for example she's entered a survey when she meets with parents at the beginning
of the year for example back to school nights um she talks to all the parents um to kind of give
some backstory to kelly kelly when she was a young teacher made an assumption about a student and his
lived experiences that were so foreign to her own that she was appalled with her with herself and that
very emotional experience led to a processing and changing of her identity in the form of what was
appropriate and what can i do so she had a student who was sleeping on her class and she kept saying
why do you sleep like this isn't so inappropriate and then one did the student and her and the guidance
counselor were talking and it was saying um you know my father's out of the picture i work three
jobs at night i come to school immediately after a night shift and i'm tired and that was not
something she ever experienced she did not experience that type of um challenge or hardship
in her life so that type of um assuming about people prevented her from in the future making
assumptions about students she often came to them with a bit of um empathy in the way of hoping that
they will respond to her but she's not going to change her actions unlike her foil of kevin
who is just making many assumptions also by the way i would love to talk to you after the fact
about the empathic empathetic i will as obvious smiles that was a question that we also had and i
don't have a good answer for it so happily to entertain i'd be happy to talk with you about it
but can i come back to my question um so i'm i'm going to be giving a talk myself next month at a at a
state conference and um it has to do with identity and so i i was going along saying you know we need
to know about the identity of our students especially with the marginalized population
and i listed all of these marginalized populations that we need to be aware of and be sensitive to
and i believe that um but it also has been pointed out to me that not everybody identifies just
because i call them neurodivergent or uh whatever doesn't mean necessarily that they are comfortable
with that appellation right without that label um and that's sort of thrown this whole thing in my mind
so what you just said now was really important the idea of being a detective rather than a judge
um seems really important when i'm talking to teachers um i mean the the point of of being a judge i
suppose is to help ease the burden of marginalized populations that's what one's doing but um but may
misfire may not connect with the actual feelings of the intended audience there was just something on on
pbs the other night the news hour and i don't know how many people watch it or heard this part but
they were talking about a segment of the latinx population uh called no sabo did anybody hear that
no sabo business and no sabo is um a label that's used for latinx people in this country who don't speak
spanish and they resent the fact that they are and they and they feel ashamed um of the fact that they
don't speak spanish and yet there's a large segment of them they're a second or third generation
immigrants to this country right but because of their culture because of their appearance because
of their names it's assumed that they speak spanish and there's a great example i think where
you can say you know let's not make assumptions um about it let's not and and not necessarily make
accommodations if if they're not warranted um i mean i don't know how you go about discerning
that i mean you can ask them which is what you did the parents i guess i guess there's a way to ask
older learners um do you have a suggestion on that so i have a few actually and
and it's very apropos to kelly once again so kelly does have an experience where she is struggling
to communicate with some of her students kelly is not a spanish speaker um but kelly has many spanish
speaking students and um has found ways to almost as an inverse have her students empathize with her
where she she really starts to introduce her vulnerability with her students
and she encourages them or encourages them to realize like i'm trying we should try together
and it's a very warm space so she has cultivated that i don't think that's a simple i can just do
it and it happens um she has cultivated over some time but she does try and be playful with them in
that way and acknowledge i know you're struggling i'm struggling too there are also many people who
will talk about how do teachers try and learn about their students so there is the detective
what are the mechanisms or the actions a detective should take the most common of course is
perspective taking which is just a general term for trying to learn about someone else and there's
many different forms of perspective taking the common one that is most encouraged especially by
dr chesere warren out of vanderbilt is learning about your students but not trying to step into their
shoes so they're this week referred to as imagine self versus imagine other perspective taking imagine
self is where i put myself in someone's shoes imagine other is where i have to imagine them from kind of
a far it's a it's an outside perspective and the reason why he encourages people to not engage in that
of imagine self is because we can never truly know our students experiences and it is incumbent upon us to
keep awareness and try and be where appropriate equitable culturally conscious and be thoughtful
of how we are doing these things but by not making assumptions about the students at one of his papers
he actually talks about how one teacher tries to use her marginalized identity she's a white teacher who
um um i think identifies as a lesbian and she tries to use that identity to make meaning of her black
students marginalized identity and while there might be some continuity between marginalization as a
general term the experiences in america are very different so there's a there's a question of like
don't try and make assumptions about me ask me questions learn about me let's do this together and there is
also and i will say there's a form of empathy um that's called strategic empathy where teachers are
encouraged to um bring in perspectives that may run counter to their own that may that may run against
their own and which is often very difficult but you're encouraged to also remain skeptical but in that
way you're inviting lived experiences culture knowledge emotions and other experiences that often are
absent from the classroom into the classroom okay i'm not sure that answered all of your question but i'm
i'm just say a little more about that last one please yes i'm happy to also give you the link to a paper
about it okay uh but the the big thing here is that it's a strategic empathy is a very specific form of
empathy uh where you're encouraged to um invite perspectives that might feel um you're not supposed to
condone a perspective but you shouldn't condemn it either it's kind of the big idea that's not
always true of course there are times when it's appropriate um but that's that's like the big idea
and let me try and find the paper for you really quickly thank you i don't want to dominate the
discussion i can i can stand down pedagogies of strategic empathy there we go thank you everyone if you
want to read it wonderful peace thank you thank you i have a question please uh and this is for joy and
avi in your in your work you you went really deep were there any things that suggested any uh future
work toward uh any modifications of dsmri
i'm gonna say no i'm gonna turn to avi though and see if you have any perspective on that
um this specific work has not um challenged um anything in the dsmri um it it's been informative i
mean it has contributed to the development of the dsmr because the role of emotions more generally in
the dsmr is something that we're still exploring the emotion itself as a dynamic systems and how it
manifests emotion is with all its multifaceted components how does it look in a dsmri so in that
sense yes um it hasn't challenged but we all realize that the dsmri is a model in progress
i mean once it stops progressing we can probably throw it away but it's it's um as as um we continue
to progress it so joey's uh dissertation research has brought emotion most explicitly so far into the
dsmri but the other things that we're learning and this is where the dsm is continuing to develop is
um how it is manifesting the social cultural dynamics um as a control parameter or a set of
control parameters within which it is emerging and contributing in turn to the change in the
environment as well i want to add one more thing where i think i found a novel use of the dsmri that i
never thought of before and this work really inspired it which is taking the literature and
embedding it into the dsmri has been very useful the dsmri in that way is becoming the framework but
i can use other constructs so you because you see as you saw from this work really you only saw a
snapshot um but i was able to take existing empathy constructs and embed them inside the dsmri in a way
that felt meaningful to the authentic experience and the teacher's identity their motivations emotions
goals etc um but i also have been um developing obviously we should have a conversation about
emotion regulation because i also know that the emotion regulation has goals has actions has
beliefs and self-perceptions emotional awareness emotion regulation by definition is our goal states
for example is something called hedonic versus uh um instrumental goals we have uh beliefs about
emotion regulation and then there are emotion regulation techniques that are the action
possibilities so what i found really fascinating is many of the literatures that we use fit inside the
dsmri especially if you're interested in the role components and the person's motivation actions decisions
etc and i i'll just add on what joey said so so the dsmri is a meta theoretical framework and in that it
provides provides the frame for theories to both be incorporated but also to inform local theories of
phenomena within that frame um so i think in that sense it's um flexible in that in the way that joey was
describing um but another comment just to uh diane's your your uh um imminent presentation about identity and
how in students identities and how the teachers relate to students identity perhaps the dsmri can
be helpful there as well because what the dsmri emphasizes that identity is not the nominal
categorization and even not the intersectional interaction of various nominal categorizations but
it's how the student constructs their own meaning of who they are in the contextual world they occupy
um and more generally the identity system is comprised is comprising uh the multiple um roles they have in
life so developing in in empathy and being empathic towards a student um is not about like what you know
it's not like being the judge and making assumptions about them because of their intersectional social um
group memberships but rather it's trying to understand how do they construct who they are as a student and
then the the smri could provide um helpful language to think how do these students construct
understanding of their reality what are the purpose and goals what are their self-perceptual
self-definitions rather than um the the external imposition of those and what do they perceive as
available actions for them in that context in light of how they define themselves the goals they pursue
and the construction of reality and particularly to me at least um being empathic towards such a person
you still understand what their dilemmas where are the tensions in their role identities whether they
feel negative emotions and then maybe they don't fit or they don't know exactly what to do so um i i
thought that that might be helpful yeah thank you i just put the dsmri paper in the chat for you
so in case you want to look at it and go a little more detailed there yeah i think you should be
giving the paper next month though not i okay kind of building off of um what joey said and what dr
kaplan has said i'm really interested in um kind of understanding empathy and like joey was talking
about emotional regulation in collaborative group settings what do you think is the potential for these
models especially how you depicted them to show reciprocal relationships of empathy between
students teachers peers all in the same model i think this has a really great applicability to
like i said not just empathy but regulation and um socially regulated emotions or socially
regulated empathy um or like you were talking about at the beginning like emotional contagion what
do you think about depicting all of those things using these brilliant models that you have um shown
us today um can i just have a simple answer of yes um that works yeah thank you so well so i can tell
you that there are ways in which people have depicted um abhi uh has depicted the interaction of different
groups so you can look at the you can look at a group role identity it's not it's not only just the
individuals um or at the group level how does that change of course because we're using complexity
approaches what you do at the group level will look different what you do at the individual level
my research is often just i'm fascinated by teachers um i think that helping t my my goals personal
goals are in relation to helping teachers teach better and this is the way that i think i can help
them is in this form um i think there are people who are more interested in as to your point the
relational aspect of it and there are um i've been working on some of the conceptualizations behind
what does it mean when i start to develop and um another person's identity through that empathic
experience or empathetic experience whatever word you want to use um and um i do believe that you can
then capture where does something like emotional contagion if those who aren't familiar emotional
contagion is the description of when something like uh one emotion kind of is infectious around
a group so for example i smile and you all smile would be an example of that or i start crying you
all start crying um and i do believe that that's also quite easy because it would then highlight the
contextual and relational nature of the empathic experience that is at the heart of what is the work
it's just that i as a researcher have drawn my boundaries around the teacher specifically and
in fact a critique of my work has and is appropriately so this does not include the perception of the
students in the classroom right i'm only looking at the teacher's perceptions of their empathy i haven't
included the students and i will say those who are interested um there's a new there's new work coming
out by um jeff volman at tennessee and his advisor dr miller at um george mason where they have been
looking at um how do we examine teacher empathy but by the students perceptions of their of their
teachers empathy i will say though in my own critiques though it is a survey so it still thought it
has the same follies that a survey has so i think honestly maybe mali to your point jeff and i should talk
you should join us and then maybe we could find a cool way of taking jeff's ideas but then putting
them inside the dsmri making them fit although i will say avi i would like to hear if you have any
thoughts on that as well because i feel like that might be where i've seen some of the work especially
museums also moving if you you have uh sharing uh um privileges if you want to actually show there's
a diagram in the um article you shared yeah we take i mean because it's a you know we we work from
the complex dynamic system it's a hierarchical uh system and as joey said you know his uh research
forms an artificial boundary around the role identity of a teacher and their emergence of
their identity and empathic um elements for that role identity but you can then zoom out and have
the focus be on an interaction between teachers students um or a team members working together and
trying and then each role identity is emerges uh in relation and through feedback loops uh with the
others um you know with with whom they're interacting and we try to capture this with this image um in the
uh in the article let me let me pull it up right now sorry my computer was acting up a little bit
okay um i'm not sure why i keep trying to show you there we go so the example that i was talking
about is you can see the individual a individual b individual c with inside and that's once again
framed by their context their domain their culture and their dispositions and also a key feature as
you can see that there are multiple dsm ris inside the dsm rise highlighting the nested nature and also
the permeability between identities your teacher identity can have can bleed over have influence with
your parent identity and that's that that's kind of what you're seeing here and i think my to your
point this is one of the unique features um once again i just drew my boundary at a very specific
point yeah that nestedness is really interesting thanks thanks for sharing i'll have to explore it
further and talk to you and jeff some more oh we all we'll have to hit up an ara and we'll we'll make it work
um yeah we are coming to the end of our presentation um joey thank you so much uh for this rich uh
presentation and wonderful discussion um hold on i'm sorry this is my first experience um hosting
these presentations so we are looking forward to seeing you in our uh upcoming webinar next month
