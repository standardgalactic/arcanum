one of my experiences which most people have never had is i was witness because of my position at
google and because of you know at the time and because of my history of being a very prominent
businessman in the middle east for a long time so i was very much entangled into what was happening
with the arab spring um not that i had any views on it because i had not lived in my home country
egypt for maybe 20 years at the time but you know i i'd been in a position of i know the internet
really well so almost everyone was constantly reaching out to me the previous government the
transition government the you know the opposition everyone was just talking to me all the time
saying what's happening right and and i have to admit in my mind i think the arab spring seems to
have been a glitch in the system where where you know somehow because arabs at the time were so
offline if you want you gave them a tiny bit of online community and suddenly they go like this is
shit right and and they they organize and they explode okay and i have to say i you know i feel
that leading after the arab spring into 2019 2020 there was there were start that you could see quite a
bit of organized opposition around the world hong kong here in the uk and so on and so forth
and it's i i don't think that this is the reason for covert i you know i'm not into that conspiracy
at all okay and i know you wrote about you know the covert economy if you want but it seems to me
that somehow governments found a massive opportunity to say okay everyone stay home right let's not
organize in the streets anymore no more arab spring and you could actually recognize very quickly that
post-covered everyone's silent everyone's like yeah what was that right and let's talk about that
era a little bit no conspiracy theory here but but two things happened with covet one is actually
society at large was disciplined everyone was ordered to sit home nobody had freedom to add to do
anything but at the same time massive amounts of money were funneled into the system through printing
money basically more debt right uh and i think that completely shifted i think this was a you know
the one big nail in the coffin of freedom if you think about it what do you think of that i think yeah
that is a very interesting and well thought through analysis because you're right it's not conspiratorial
um to say that governments in particular but also big multinational corporations took advantage of a
crisis to strengthen their position and you see this happening over and over and over again you know
naomi klein um talks about the shock doctrine and disaster capitalism the way in which the powerful are
able to take advantage of moments of crisis and uncertainty to embed and strengthen their control
one example that uh she uses which i find really fascinating um is the example of the tsunami um and
the crisis and devastation that took place in the maldives and the way in which that was used to remove
people who had been living on the islands in the maldives for a very very long time settle them all in
a very very small area of the capital and ultimately sell those islands off to big hotels so that they would
become centers for you know luxury tourism basically now no you know no one's saying the government
caused that natural disaster but they took advantage of it to basically kind of redistribute power and
wealth within that economy and i think that you can say the same about the pandemic um and that that takes
place both within individual societies and at the level of the world economy now you mentioned there
um you know having uh been born in the middle east and been a businessman in the middle east for a while
and that that idea of debt as a disciplining tool resonates with you now you can see that at the
level of kind of individual consumers but you can also see that at the level of whole states
nations exactly of course so the name for my book vulture capitalism comes from um this uh vulture fund
basically which was just after the 2008 financial crisis zambia which is a you know relatively small
african nation big copper producer had nothing to do with the financial crisis but because of the
collapse in world gdp after 2008 um copper prices fell its export revenues kind of dried up and its
debts started to look unsustainable so there was an irish fund that bought zambia's debt knowing that
zambia was going to default on that debt so that it could sue the government of zambia for failing to pay
its debts and take vast amounts of money out of the pockets of ordinary zambians and suck it back
into the rich world now this is the kind of what you might call kind of lawfare it's like warfare using
international legal systems yeah that you see all the time in the world economy and debt is a very
powerful tool for basically crushing um entire nations and particularly nations where you're beginning to
see some resistance to the dynamics of global capitalism and i think you're quite right that
we did start to see that in a really big way before the pandemic i think part of the reason for that
was that we were moving from a unipolar world into a multipolar world now you know you can say
whatever you want about the dynamics that underpin that but ultimately when you have two superpowers
all the other countries in the world economy have a little bit more leverage a little bit more room
basically because they're able to exactly put them put them off against each other before it was the
washington consensus which is you know you follow the rules laid out by washington or you don't get
any money and you're kind of ostracized for the world from the world economy now these countries have
more than one uh superpower to pick from they can maybe go to china if they want lending for infrastructure
that's going to come with a lot of strings attached and a lot of problems but ultimately there is
this this choice now what you see over the course of the pandemic is a lot of nations being really
kind of beaten down using the tool of debt because um a lot of countries as soon as the pandemic hit
basically found themselves unable to repay their debts through no fault of their own the global economy
had been shut down you know the factories that were using the resources that they were exporting
were no longer operating suddenly they were unable to pay their debts we had a debt moratorium so a
pause on debt repayments but the the debts themselves kept increasing because of interest exactly
and that has continued to this day except for the fact that it's getting worse because of climate
breakdown so you see you know natural disasters cyclones hurricanes we've just seen in the
caribbean recently that caused massive devastation and caribbean nations come forward and say you know
we as the international community have agreed that small island countries countries at risk of
desertification all of these problems that are going to come from climate breakdown we shouldn't be the
only ones that have to bear the burden of climate breakdown so we would like some of these debts that
we're going to have to take out to reconstruct after this natural disaster that we didn't cause that
basically you in the global north caused we're going to ask for some grace on that debt and what they get
is so tiny it's barely enough to allow them to recover let alone put in place the conditions for
sustainable long-term economic growth
