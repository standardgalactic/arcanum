not going to convince white people to change that's not going to be the way that this happens
you have to deal with the actual problem which is the political economic system
and you can do that without like you can actually you could you could you can have a revolution
without white people welcome back to the tea the show where we dive into the stories behind the
headlines i'm your host miriam francois here in the centers of empire we were long sold the notion
of progress toward an egalitarian ideal but in practice things aren't getting better for everyone
and they are absolutely getting worse for some in the midst of widening inequality it should surprise
no one to see the rise of parties pandering to racist voters desperate to find someone to blame
other than themselves aka the millionaire and billionaire tax avoiders running the country
and with it weirdly impassioned debates about woke having gone too far and political correctness gone
mad have blossomed in other words a nostalgia for a time when white men could speak even more freely
about why they're so superior to everyone else with the return of what some view as an open white
supremacist to the white house but also a growing confidence and pushback from global south nations
racism and race are front and center in the struggle over the very future of our societies to help us try
and make sense of this juncture i'm joined today by a towering figure in black studies and author of
several books including the groundbreaking the new age of empire professor kayende andrews as the uk's
first black studies professor and a fierce critic of what he calls the psychosis of whiteness he brings
his razor-sharp analysis to bear on the latest flashpoints in our ever evolving racial landscape before
we get into it can i ask you to do one thing and to support the show and that is to hit that subscribe
button now and sign up to our patreon details are in the caption below thank you kayende welcome to the
show thank you for being here no thank you for having me on really appreciate your presence at this
complicated difficult what's the word we should be using on this one exciting exciting okay we'll delve
into why you think it's an exciting time you you've i mean you've authored a book called white psychosis
um can you tell us what white psychosis is and are we in the grips of it well yeah the psychosis of
whiteness is it's the delusions right so if you think about that we live in an economy where children
die every day a child dies every 10 seconds because they haven't got access to food and water we have
our mobile devices and we need young kids in the congo to go into to mines to take them out um and the
world is no more equal today than it was 200 years ago but we have to pretend that it is so the psychosis
of whiteness is all of these delusions to make us think that the blood on our hands is actually the
sweat from our hard work that we deserve all these privileges that we have in the west so it's just a
set of ideas which really keep us going down this terrible terrible path and how are those ideas
sustained like how how have we all come to believe in the psychosis of whiteness like what's the
infrastructure to keep us like maintained within that belief the idea for the psychosis came from me
watching movies about slavery in the uk there's been two movies made about slavery bell which was
about the only black woman who was raised in a mansion house because her father was a lord and
her mother was an enslaved african and it's this whole like fantasy tale this jane austen drama of
18th century and you watch it and you go what's happening how is this the story and the other one was
about william wilberforce uh the white guy who ended slavery apparently and those are the two movies and
i'm watching these movies going this is psychotic right this is actually psychosis has two elements
one is delusional thinking but two is that you have to have these hallucinations and the media actually
are give you these hallucinations which reinforce all these terrible ideas that we get in schools
that we get home that we get everywhere happy black history months well don't get me started on black
history book that in itself could be one of the main main problems there's a lot of pushback
obviously at the moment against this idea that actually um diversity has gone too far right we
you know we needed it 50 years ago and today you know the argument goes that black people are
overrepresented on screen the minorities have all of these schemes to support them and that actually
the people who are falling behind even in terms of things like education are white men or white boys
what do you make of that argument i mean that's a perfect example of psychosis right like it's
utterly untrue there is no evidence have you been to meet i mean as somebody who works in media
who works in universities you're going all the top jobs there's so few of us it's crazy dominated by
white men but they're though you have these attempts to try and address that and they haven't worked so
dei edo everyone to call it it's mostly performative doesn't do anything um but that then becomes this
bogeyman oh look we're the real ones falling behind but all the evidence all the evidence will tell
you that it's simply not true that's these delusional ideas what we need to keep everything everything going right
what would you reply to the people who say well you know they're actually over you're overrepresented
in in these spheres well you could you can be overrepresented but that doesn't necessarily mean
it's positive right so for example take the media overrepresented on screen yes behind the screen no
production companies no telling the story is not at all it's kind of like football where there's loads
of black footballers but who actually has the power in football it's not the people on the pitch
so even though yes there's more of us on screen it does not mean that we're benefiting also
people in cities are overrepresented london's overrepresented and actually when you take that
into camp we're probably underrepresented on screen because in the cities we're massively overrepresented
so again it's easy to look at it so you see a lot of black people black faces yeah actually black faces
doesn't mean we've made any progress i think that's and even in politics media the black faces does not
mean we've changed actually if you look at the the fundamental underlying things they're still
they're still exactly the same and what would your measure of positive change be like how would you
assess it because clearly the assessment measures that are being used are skewed you know you refer
to for example the fact that if you look behind the scenes in tv it's very different to the picture
that we are painting in our ads which is you know i guess part of something that riz ahmed had talked
about years ago when it comes to america america exports this really like multicultural multi-racial
uh dream to the rest of the world right the amerocratic um multi-racial dream um and in reality
the society is completely different to that and so the sort of hollywood serves as a to buttress this
notion of an egalitarian society which is at odds with the reality do we have a version of that here would
you say in the uk yeah 100 i mean what's happened is you have token changes symbolic changes so yeah
america's like perfect at this where you'll see lots of you'll see lots of diversity on screen but
not behind not behind the cameras not in terms even terms of the stories that get told and in the uk
we're trying to do we're starting to see the same thing right so you'll get diversity performative
diversity um you know we had a brand prime minister right prime minister of the most racist government
probably ever in the uk but certainly in in my lifetime um and so and so it sells you this this
dream and that dream that's the psychosis because we need that right we need those delusions to think
that we've gone in the right we've gone too well we now think we've gone too far right so we're
actually not addressing any of the actual problems which are about wealth inequality which are about
life like for example if i was going to say one thing we should actually focus on would be life
expectancy and not just in the uk so what we tend to do is we just look at the uk and say well look how
we're doing in the uk which is one measure but actually look how we're doing globally it's
horrendous the life expectancy in nigeria which has like a fifth of the continent of africa is 54
years old like it's horrendous you are far more the eight if you're black you're so more likely to die
earlier even in the uk and in america too um close that gap let's close the life expectancy gap that
will be a start and to do that though then you have to say well actually let's look at these big
economic issues let's look at structural inequality and those aren't those those are just not the
questions that we're having how would you interpret trump's re-election particularly after what we
saw right which is i think a lot of people after what happened in on the 6th january insurrection
you know there was a recognition that white supremacists were literally on the doorstep and in
some cases actually in the white house um and and yet here we are i actually thought he would get
re-elected but that's because of the psychosis the idea that this man is totally incapable incredible
because that becomes president again a convicted felon you just list it all up that's like oh
that's one thing that's the delusions you can look past all of that and still say this should be the
person that leads the country this should be the leader of the free world that is there's probably
no better example of the the impact of the psychosis than trump and how do you sense that he's succeeded
in doing that because on one hand he'll make claims like he supports a quote unquote colorblind
and merit-based society because and again i quote whether you are black or brown or white we all
bleed the same red blood blood of patriots i mean is he selling his own version of an egalitarian dream
yeah i mean that is the dream right that was martin luther king um just my i had a dream that
my kids can play with white kids and that's what it gets reduced to uh which has become such a big
part of america's more broad psychosis around race is it actually martin luther king's used by the right
wing uh used by trump in fact at trump's inauguration they had the black pastor cooning up the place with
his um with his with his telling of the i have a dream speech i mean it really is selling this dream
uh but it is a dream right it is a completely and utterly delusional but it's the reason that trump
and the right more generally win is because they understand psychosis it doesn't need evidence doesn't
need facts it doesn't it's about feel it's about emotion and the left spends far too much time
saying look this is gonna be bad for your pocketbook this is the economic issue these are all the
rational reasons you shouldn't do this but the right no trump knows he's okay he just lies it says
what you want to hear and it says what you want to hear soothes you and that's how you win and now we
also have removed all the fact checking on the platforms where most people are absorbing their
information so that despite the fact that trump is continuously caught actually spreading lies
on social media a lot of people will not even now know that those are liars because we are now
living in what a post-truth world yeah but they don't care that's the thing the fact honestly the
fact checking don't matter they don't care you can tell somebody it's a lie they will not care but why
why don't they care because again psychosis like like we we this is the way i wrote the book about
psychosis because we we we rightly think that these things should matter right it should matter the
evidence it should matter yeah it should matter right it should but when you're dealing with someone in a
psychosis you wouldn't if someone was like at a psychotic episode you wouldn't try to reason with
them right you wouldn't try to explain to them rationally what's going on you'd understand that
would be a dead end and this is exactly how we have to treat this issue you're not going to be
able to you can't reason with whiteness we've been on the right side of the argument for 500 years
it just gets us killed right so we have to actually treat the disease and the disease is the system the
economic base the political order that's the disease and we spend far too much time driving ourselves mad
in these totally not only irrational conversations yeah um and i and i hear that because i think
obviously uh in the la over the last 16 months we've engaged with uh you know kind of the the very
very violent face of whiteness in its military form uh in the middle east and there is actually no
reasoning with any of the kind of traditional markers whether it's international law human rights global
consensus you know democratic majority none of it actually matters because there is you know a policy
behind all of that that is more weighty than anything that we kind of have held up as these
ideals and i suppose that's partly why there is a sense that we are at a period of like a crumbling
old order but the new order that people are trying to forge looks pretty scary to a lot of people
um here in the uk uh just a poll recently shows that if voters went to the polls today reform uk would
win the elections they have a majority of votes today and i just want to remind our international
uh viewers who reform uk are so uh it's a party formed by nigel farage who uh is on the far right of
the right by any standards a number of their candidates um during the elections were outed
and caught on camera making racist isomophobic homophobic comments um the party has kind of been
mired in this reputation for a racist outlook the other interesting and concerning thing is that they
are doing exceptionally well on tick tock so they have over 3.8 million followers on tick tock they're doing
much better than any other party with young men in particular and so i wanted to ask you about
what this rise of like reform uk means for you know everyone but i guess particularly minoritized
communities and is it the same implications for everyone would you say well yeah i mean i think
this is again just a perfect example of the evidence doesn't matter right like faraj was the one who was
pro-brexit was brexit and we know that brexit was bad like we can feel it we can actually economically
feel it in our pockets but yeah still he's wildly popular and a prediction i'll give you is he will
eventually be prime minister oh god no 100 no it's coming really kemi badenoch makes a deal with reform
they win the election he gets rid of her she's probably he's probably there that's what that i
promise you i get this is to see that this is gonna happen give it five years give it next election
cycle eventually faraj is going to be prominent if trump could be president oh if trump could be president
why would we even be surprised i mean i i suppose you're right and we shouldn't be but i guess on
one hand and and i suppose this applies just as much to trump but i look at someone like nagel fraj who is
who is an elite he's a millionaire he's he's from you know public uh you know public in the uk by the
way guys means private anywhere else in the world but basically he's he's he's from a wealthy background
and yet he's out here speaking like he's for the common man and you know he's the representative of
this like white working class underclass that isn't heard anywhere else it's baffling it kind
of i don't get it the job trump's perfectly exactly right rich man comes from that speaks to the common
person it's psychosis again mediocre white men mediocre white men is a feature of history i mean
honestly a feature of history and someone like faraj the fact he can do it we shouldn't be surprised
and the fact he'll use it all the way to get to prime minister i would not be surprised at all
that's where we're headed unless unless the left starts to deal with emotion right you can't deal
with someone like faraj with facts brexit should have told us that the facts don't work facts are
totally and utterly irrelevant it's all about emotion and what they've done really well in both sides of
the atlantic is they blame us they blame immigrants for their cause i mean faraj the big thing faraj is
if you're going to say what class is the most the most culpable for the fact that nothing works in
the country and it just is run down you haven't got jobs it's his class right it's his class that
takes all the wealth yeah tax tax dodges etc um that's the problem but they've turned that and
blamed it on us there's too many of us there's too many immigrants and people are lapping that up and
unfortunately we're lapping that up too right we're black british now we don't care about we don't care
about migrants across in the atlantic across in the uh mediterranean we want to keep them out as well
you've seen that that's been a big thing you've seen in america which again trump getting elected by
uh majority of latinos people how can that be the case yes they think they think they're american
they don't think they're latino and we have this very similar problem here in in britain where we
think we're british and then because of that we act like british like and what do the brits do pull
up the borders keep it for ourselves etc so you'll find far more support for things like reform and
the right uh from black and brown communities than there definitely should be so you're an advocate for
transnational identities um and why what would you identify as being the issue with black british
identity i mean you've hinted obviously at some of it now but there is obviously a growing interest
in this notion of black british identity um and what i guess what does it mean to you
britain is the enslaving nation right britain i'm in britain because um some british people went to west
africa took my ancestors to the caribbean enslaved them for hundreds of years then colonized them and
then we had to move over here because of uh because we were poor right because jamaica's a colony i do
the idea that i want to to feel identified with this terrible country has done this to not just to me
uh but to large parts of the world the largest empire that ever existed that has impoverished the
world to the point that a child dies every 10 seconds because they because they haven't got access
food and water britain is not good right you can make a case yes we are just as we are just as um
everything my family has done has been just as important to building up britain but i'm actually
not proud of that because what britain is is britain is a colonial wicked nation state so why would
i want to identify with it i'm in britain but i'm not british i'm just here but i'm not here because i
want to be here because this this is we we got kidnapped would you advocate for forms of solidarity
based on any things other than the nation state because of course i think we also forget that
the nation state is a relatively new invention right i mean particularly for some parts of the
world it was a relatively new external imposition is your perspective grounded in like a connection
to the nation state just not being any sort of um basis for solidarity um at all yeah no this is not
just a britain argument by the way i'd say the same but jamaicans don't like it but i said the same
thing yeah jamaica is a prison colony well my dad talks about going back home what kind of home is
there's a home you have literally taken to in chains and has impoverished you ever since uh on the
african continent all these countries are made up nigeria ghana they just drew it on a map to control
and contain you the worst thing you can do is identify with whichever nation state you are in the nation
state that we have uh you can directly tie a line to western imperialism and how to control us i'm
black i'm black that means i connect to africa and my my my connection is to africa and the african
descent that that's that's i'm black and i'm in britain i'll never ever ever call me british because
that is not something i'll never adopt and it's interesting because you're saying that at a time
where i feel like there's such a push to um on one hand we're going through some of the most
overtly racist discourse i think i've seen in in my lifetime in the public arena i think there
are things that are said publicly now that um like even when i was a kid when there would have been
more racism on the streets people were a bit more shy to say those things publicly they think the
things that said much more openly now and at the same time we have someone like kemi badnock who's
elected to the head of the conservative party in in this country and that is seen as a huge measure of
success for the country but also for black britishness so what do you say to you know
people like kemi and others who say well no look this is this is progress this is advancement
it's regression there's definitely not progress i mean i predicted before kevin badnock will be the
first black prime minister and no black people will be happy about it like so what is if we're all mad
and we're all going oh my god that's terrible that can't be good for black britain or whatever whatever
that means right and i think one of the things that has changed to some extent uh because it was
always the case like we do forget the british empire couldn't have run without collaborators
like most of the people in india the administrator the administrative level would have been indian
same in african countries you have the chiefs etc like there's lots of it's always been collaborators
right the difference now is because we're here you can actually get to the top top right you can be
obama you can be kemi you can have black faces in those in those places um but if we think that
change if that we think that changes the nature of what the role is that the prime minister of
britain the president of the united states those are white supremacist roles that's what they are
so you can be in the role it doesn't it doesn't matter what color you could be green you're still
going to be white supremacist right and so and so what's actually happened with the right and the
right have understood this they've said well let's let's get in these elected officials let's get in
put people in these highest places possible carry on doing racist policies and we can pretend we're not
racist and that's what they'll do can be better can be better if kemi badnock becomes prime minister she will be
it i guarantee it will also be the most racist administration they will be able to get away
with things they couldn't possibly get away with with the white prime minister in fact if you look
at the immigration legislation that's been passed in the last few years under the tories deportation
flights windrow scandal um putting people in the barge uh rwanda like this honestly is madness
it's not a coincidence that it was asian home home secretary asian home secretary asian home secretary
when the last age no secretary left they had to move the black one from cleverly from foreign
secretary to home secretary so they had cover for their racist policy it actually gets more racist
when you have black and brown people in those positions so this is not progress it's the opposite
well speaking of progress i feel like we've always been sold this notion that in at least in western
societies that history is just a uh you know inevitable progress towards you know a betterment for
everyone right and i don't want to sound like i've drunk the kool-aid but i do think that each
generation's been sold this notion that it's just always getting better we're getting healthier we're
living longer life is better you know and i guess for some people that is the case yeah but we're also
living uh at a time where there's huge inequality and growing inequality so do you think we're also
seeing this dismantling of this um paradigm of the progress narrative and without that
what direction are we headed in because we all believed it was getting better if we're going to
put that aside now where where are we heading better worse you know stagnation different directions
for different groups so i think there's there's there's two two delusions happening at the same time
so one of those is it's actually true so it actually is true that over the last 300 years
uh for some people white people in the west things have been getting better like significantly better
right and that's because of genocide slavery and colonialism they built this they built this economy
that has pulled people up in britain and the west into unparalleled levels of success wealth
technological advancement etc etc etc um for most people in the world actually not got better at all so if
you if you look at um so-called sub-saharan africa it'd be it'd be very hard to argue it's better now
than it was before there's some people doing very well but most people are doing very very very very
badly think about economics talk about food security talk about even and future as well it looks even
bleaker right so there's for in the west it's got better what's happened now for us and this is the
problem for us a really big problem that we have is that when my family came over here we were that we
weren't really in we were just here but we weren't in the west right there was no racial legislation
there wasn't civil rights bills in america there wasn't independence in the caribbean and so we were
really out of it so we were still in what malcolm makes us call the field but the change has happened
over the last 60 years is we're now in it i'm a professor like it would be ridiculous for me to
how can i criticize britain and not criticize myself i i have my wealth because of the same because black
kids die so i'm culpable now i'm in it right so we we're and now we're now in the house and we're now
also benefiting and then and then actually still ignoring the fact that most people aren't benefiting
and i think what we're seeing all we're seeing at the moment is that within the west there's some
people have taken too far right the the the elite have captured all the money and there doesn't need
to be a reset and i think what you'll probably see is eventually there'll be a reset where you get
more like social democracy you get more sharing of the wealth within the within the west not outside
the west though the rest of the world needs to be poor and they're not going to be benefiting all of
this right so we're actually going to end up with a political moment where we'll probably over here
do better in the long run but the rest of the world will still be just as poor as they ever
were because you have to have that poverty to produce the wealth that we're fighting over
that was going to be my next next question so is the wealth of western nations predicate
predicated on the exploitation and poverty of the global south is there a version of the story in
which wealth is redistributed more equally and everyone benefits or are we saying this is like an
inherent feature of the system it's always been the feature of the system right so you needed slavery
in order to produce the wealth that produced the working class we talk about the working class and
that's only possible because of the wealth that became that came from slavery and that allowed
capital industrial industrial progress factories etc etc etc once people in the west got to a level
where they didn't want to do factory work what did they do they exploited right so now it takes place
in the underdeveloped world so there's two areas in terms of the the wages they pay the workers uh in the
factories overseas could never have those here right never have those here but you need those
wages in order to to make commodity prices work and on the african continent it's predominantly about
resource extraction right so we're taking cobo all the all the minerals etc imagine that capitalism
would collapse immediately if you had to pay a decent a decent wage to people in asia and then it had
to pay decent prices for commodities in africa yeah completely collapsed yeah so you need to have that
poverty for us to have our wealth i guess that's part of the bind that we're all kept in like this
devil's packed where it's like none of us want to give up the comforts of the life that we've built
albeit it's largely crumbs for many people compared to what the majority are getting but it's still
better crumbs than nothing on the table at all right and so um i mean i guess the question around that is
is there a a model of liberation that is able to encompass the dignity of all
peoples or is there always a situation of winners and losers no i mean i think we have to believe
that there is possible to have much more equality but you just you you cannot have it in this system
to quote malcolm again because i just quote malcolm x all the time but he says this system can no more
provide freedom justice and equality for black people than a chicken can lay a duck egg right it's
not meant to do it right so if we think we can edit this system which is has always been based on
our oppression to somehow be equal equal it's not it's not the case we have to get rid of the whole thing and
and rebuild and that is going to mean losing things we're not going to be as comfortable
you could create a world where everybody is comfortable that world probably won't have all
the highs all those massive highs of the rich but those are the things that we want right yeah
and my kids telling me oh daddy i want to be a billionaire yeah i was like no we don't you don't
that's banned in my house yes you don't want to be a billionaire yeah you don't need billionaires or
billionaires it's that that that world is a different world we need to build a world where actually we're
saying how do we all eat how do we all function how do we all how are we all comfortable and happy but that's
a completely different world to the one we we have in there good luck on selling that on instagram is
all i'm gonna say because i also have been prior like privy to the rise of the pro-billionaire content
which i have to believe the you know the deepest recesses of my conspiracy self believe is very much
intended uh to to kind of buttress this notion of like well anyone could technically be a billionaire
which of course we know is even less likely than the previous myth of everybody could be a millionaire

you'll find the link in our bio i want to talk to you about the dei schemes which obviously uh president
trump one of the first things he did was to cancel these dei policies um many people are bemoaning
that um you know amnesty international um has written about this as kind of white supremacist um policies
that trump has brought about using explicitly those terms white supremacist um but i also know that a lot
of people are very skeptical of dei i know you are i am quite skeptical myself um is the loss of these
schemes a loss no i mean just be blunt it's not like i can't sit here and tell you that it's not i
mean it is some big loss they don't do anything right the dei equality diversity is is mostly
pointless companies spend thousands of pounds on nonsense okay let me let me put the counter just
for balance here so somebody would say uh well dei allows candidates who would otherwise be overlooked
to be considered for roles that they wouldn't otherwise be considered for um is it not a loss
that there are very talented black and brown candidates female candidates disabled candidates
who will no longer be put forward in certain roles um who will be overlooked for certain roles
because these dei schemes are no longer there so in the uk is certainly not the case that there's any
real deal that ever really happens so affirmative action here is not really a thing right they put on
a they put on a flyer black people please apply and then you don't get the job right even in the
united states i think it's heavily overestimated how many people actually got their job because of
affirmative action it's not that many right people get the job because they're good at their jobs
largely and actually people and people don't get the job because things racist right so you can have
policies um the nfl is a good example the rooney rule so you have to interview two black candidates
for every head coaching job okay they just interview the two black candidates and then hire the white
candidate right so it doesn't doesn't work anyway so i doubt i doubt there's much good evidence to
suggest that removing dei policies will actually lead to people getting jobs then there's the second
thing of who actually gets the jobs anyway um dei in terms of that in that concrete people getting
jobs they have this any black will do right so there's any old black person not even black you can just
be a bit of color come come in and get the job and that's fine and then the idea that that's what
success is that we measure success by the fact it's a few black people and it's only going to be
a handful of black people who get these jobs anyway that doesn't doesn't mean success right
in america has a much bigger middle class than britain has much more black elected officials than
britain and is much more obviously structurally racist than britain at the same time right so even
if it does lead to a few less job people being hired i'm not sure that's that that that shouldn't
be the goal anyway and broadly speaking when you think about what's being cancelled it is these
initiatives that it's just expect i know for a fact because i make this money right so february
comes along now usually america i'm getting invites can you come and do a talk we'll give
you some money i'm always feeling a bit guilty you don't do nothing it's just there's an industry
that don't make no difference like it's not really the end of the world i'll be honest i'm not
saying i support trump on this because trump the reason he's doing it is clearly racist and one of
the negative impacts will be that black people will lose jobs and predominantly black women are going to
lose jobs so that is a bad thing don't get me wrong i'm not saying this is something we should we should
be praising um but i think that if we actually think something's been lost that shows us that we
don't understand what the problem was in the first place and i mean you're you've also been critical
generally of i mean you mentioned they're going to give these talks these di talks i've done kind of
i know exactly the circuit that you're talking about uh we have our own version of that in the muslim
sector um and i wanted to ask you um about the notion that uh talking about race is helpful because
i think you've previously said that you think talking about race is not helpful um and i wanted
to ask you about that because um well apart from anything else i did have a podcast called we need
to talk about whiteness so yeah so why do you think it's unhelpful to talk about race so it can be
helpful don't get me wrong if you're having a productive conversation it can be helpful yeah i think what
2020 showed us is you know george floyd happens it's a massive conversation about race yeah for
a moment it seemed productive actually it did seem like there were different conversations but then
what happened very very quickly was backlash right it's massive backlash and in fact without that
backlash i strongly doubt trump gets elected if it just 2020 doesn't happen it's just a we just carry
on normally we'd have remembered that trump was you know the uh we remembered everything with uh the
capital we don't remember the capital we remembered stuff we remembered all that stuff but this he
basically gets elected on this the resentment wave that comes back because we all started talking about
race right the kkk love talking about race all the time and i think you've seen the same thing in
britain we're having this conversation about race which is heavily unproductive and he's actually
taking us in the completely opposite opposite direction and that's the problem so it's interesting
because i i do uh think that the way that we talk about race despite there being so many
conversations about race does seem to be really unproductive and i guess one of the ways that
seems obvious to me and it applies in debates and again debates is the issue on things like islamophobia
right so people are not encouraged to come on tv and to talk about their experiences so other people
could learn about maybe an experience or worldview that they're not familiar with but more so to debate
the veracity or accuracy of that experience which surely is only as true as the person who's
experiencing it tells you it is um and so i was wondering to that extent whether
the issue is that we continue to look at racism as a debate yeah yeah i mean that's the problem
right so i actually interestingly i much more prefer going on right-wing platforms and talking to people
like um piers morgan that'd make one of us but when you go on bbc it's always this is racism real
those racists watch your experience and there's no and they like close the debate so it's not really
a debate it's just a nonsense conversation it doesn't have any you can't say anything to if you
say anything too content they'll shut it down straight away and they're just not there's nothing
that's pointless honestly that that is we're not going anywhere at least if you're going like piers
morgan is right when you can throw anything you like out there they want spectacle which means you
can really put out some really com um we need we need ideas which disturb people right so when i went on
with piers morgan and said the british empire is worse than the nazis and he was he was like all
shocked but that's the kind of discussion we need to have not does racism exist that's that's a
nonsense that's a dead end let's talk about whether the british empire is worse than the nazis
that's a productive conversation which you can actually have strangely enough but do you think
do you think that you do have like an actual discussion with them about that or do you think because
i have come to the conclusion that those platforms are their entertainment more than anything else
right it's a i call it the circus and i don't know that anyone walks away from those discussions
with views different to those that they held prior and i'm also extremely conscious especially these
days of stepping into spaces where the power structures i mean all power structures are skewed
towards the global majority and in all spaces pretty much unless you're creating them yourself but um
stepping into those spaces um you you're already having to dig yourself up from
minus 15 underground before you can even start talking do you know what i mean you're not you're
not starting at ground zero you're you're having to dig up all of this stuff that they already believe
that you know you're like you know should be paid to help them unpick before you can actually start the
conversation if you even get to have the conversation um i guess the thing is who are you trying to
convince that's the question when i go having those it's not like with peers okay forget that
but there's a whole secondary audience people online will pick it up yeah i remember so i before when i
wrote for the guardian on bbc they would never let me say psychosis of whiteness it would always get
it there it always get no you can't do this really always um when i went with peers they had a whole
section on it what's the psychosis what does this mean and then from that i had so many
conversations about psychosis and this whole on the show is whatever but there's a whole productive
second life of those conversations you just can't have on the left yeah part of the reason i wrote
the book is so that the guardian had to put it in a guardian and then i had to get invited to bbc
and say psychosis of whiteness but it needed a book behind it before they'd accept it yeah so i think
we can use those platforms to get the things we want if we know what we're looking for right you're not
looking to have a debate with peter's morgan you're looking to spark that have a clip share it on social
and then have a discussion with the actual people that matter okay yeah i i suppose there's a
strategic move i can see the value although i still have to say i feel like uh the the white
man gets paid off for all of that is that anyway so they all get paid in it so use the platform to
boost yourself i say most people know me from talking to peter's morgan so yeah so use the platform to
get to get to get what you need right and what about the word whiteness itself because i mean i know
that you know i'm aware that it's controversial when i say the word whiteness i get a lot of pushback
um i get pushback even when i describe piers morgan as a white man um which is what he is both
in terms of his ethnicity but also in terms of his outlook um and i'm just wondering what your
thoughts are on for people who are listening who might be like well i find it offensive i would not
want to refer to somebody according to their skin color why are you referring to me according to
my skin color would you prefer white devil i mean that's what i probably say no i mean
fair what do you want to say it's a reality right whenever i've had people say to me you know the
nation they call people white devils and i'm like fair accurate what do you want me to say look at the
history yeah it's a difficult one to unpick it is in fact so in this Malcolm X book i'm writing there's
a chapter called you wicked race of devils right because i want to deal with that because we yeah
there's a reason why people are so critical of whiteness and white people because historically it's
really bad and contemporarily it's really bad too right um but i think the distinction of white i always
said distinction of whiteness and white people is important uh so whiteness is a is a is a set of
ideas it's an ideology it's a way of going through the world yeah the black people and brown people are
just as just as culpable in right psychosis of whiteness is not just for those with white skin at all in fact you
could probably argue we might be more susceptible to it in total but no i think if the one of the
one of the big delusions is the is this idea that white white people that whiteness is is it's um
does it it's it's invisible right we don't talk about it well if this is just black and brown people
right like you don't have anything like you don't have race quality do you yeah whiteness is the the
key framing thing in the world in fact when i go to do talks at schools i always show a map of the world
by gdp per capita so the amount of money in the country but divided by the amount of people which
is the real measure of wealth and poverty and what you find really obvious the kids always pick it out
darkest parts with the poorest parts where the black people live so-called subscari in africa richest parts
of the west where the white people live and there's this hierarchy in between we literally have a world
of white supremacy today don't tell me you can't talk about whiteness that's nonsense well it's interesting
because i do think that part of it is a resistance to having to integrate uh negative self-perception
which none of us like to do right i mean it's partly why people don't want to go to therapy because
you're going to have to hear things about yourself that you don't want to hear and i remember reading
um bell hooks uh whiteness in the black imagination which uh you know uh describes the way in which white
people often assume that they are perceived or that we are perceived as neutral uh by black people
because we perceive ourselves as neutral and so this flipping uh of of the the the way the one who
looks yeah you know because it's always white people looking at black people it's never black
people looking at white people or brown people looking at white people um projects an understanding
of white people as a group that is you know one tied up with fear and violence and anger and impunity
and that's a reflection that we don't want to face because it's an ugly reflection it's and it's not an
easy one to integrate but it's part of it do you think that there's like a subconscious i mean i know
this might even be falling into like making excuses for it but sometimes i think is it like a subconscious
thing that people don't want to confront that history and and all that then flows from it right imagine
you acknowledge it like oh god yeah we were we did we did do a few things like yeah maybe we do need to
yeah yeah no no it is it's not on purpose again also with psychosis why i like the idea that psychosis
is not something you necessarily choose right yeah but it's something that's important to to in in that
mental health case it's important to hide mass whatever illness you have right yeah and so that if
white people had to look honestly look and say well actually how did we get this wealth where how are we
here what's happening to the world yeah it it it does it's completely dissonance right that's that's
the purpose of the psychosis to keep us keep us deluded that's not really an excuse right you have
to change you have to think but why again thinking about where we go forward and how do we change
things i always say there's no point you're not going to convince white people to change that's not
going to be the way that this happens you have to deal with the actual problem which is the political
and economic system and you can do that without like you can actually you could you could you can have
a revolution without white people they'll come along eventually that the revolution is what ends white
side is the psychosis not the other way around right but for the revolution do you not need as
many people on board as possible i mean you need well i mean i'm a black radical right so i mean i
believe in the black revolution and hey if what anybody wants to help could help but we cannot wait
cannot rely on white people or anyone else right we have to rely on ourselves yeah otherwise we'll be
stuck in the same hamster wheel forever and and the black radical tradition is based i mean that answer is
also based on the idea that there have been previous attempts to reach out and create coalitions
with other like white working class groups and stuff that haven't quite led to the outcomes that
the black radical tradition would have hoped for is that would that be fair yeah certainly i mean
certainly there's i mean black radical tradition is a big term it covers a lot of things uh black
marxies in particular have always always held on to the idea that you know white working class will come
along yeah it's never materialized but to be honest black people coming along and different
materials never materialized either but there is there is a radical argument that says look if you
unite africa and you unite the diaspora that is enough to tip the scales if africa is free capitalism
can't work and therefore then you have to have a different conversation right and that's when you
start to build real solidarity and real coalition so let's talk a little bit about africa being free
because obviously the last few years we have seen some very interesting developments in the global
south more generally but also specifically in africa and i wanted to ask you about for example the uh
elections in senegal which saw a pan-african uh a new president come to power who'd obviously
previously been in prison um do we think that there is um the emergence of a new uh i guess a new
set of elites coming out of africa who are representing hope for the revolution you aspire
to some of them are coming to power through coups some of them through elections yeah i mean i think
i don't have no hope i don't but yeah i will say no i'll say this the the version of pan-africanism
which which relies on these elites to lead it is the one that's a dead end it's not gonna work i promise
you won't work um even think about elections what's the problem what did i say before the problem was
it's countries themselves right so even the problem with pan-africanism uh in the 60s and one of the
reasons why i don't necessarily use the term pan-africanism is there is this version of
pan-africanism which is very nation-state centered um non-interference with different places um everybody
gets kind of attached to their country a bit too much yeah there isn't the cooperation that you
really need and it ends up just selling out eventually to the west um and so i'm not sure that's
not what's happening at the moment but it's certainly better than what it was so let's let's say this is
that this is a good thing um that we're having you know french west africa um bikini faso there's
like you know there's there's things happening and hopefully it's positive i'm not going to say it's
not positive but you have to have grassroots up and i and i haven't really seen it you have a coup
that's not really the case you have a former leader that's not really the case are we actually
building the grassroots mechanisms across the african continent which can really hold people
accountable that's when you get actual freedom and i haven't seen that yet and i and i suppose a
lot of people would say the reason is because a lot of those countries continue to operate on a sort
of neo-colonial model where western powers continue to interfere significantly in their um politics and
in their um day-to-day running and particularly anything to do with trade um i wanted to ask you
therefore about in the case of senegal specifically so basiro diomir fey who is senegal's youngest um
president he uh you know has been pledging systemic change greater sovereignty um and his first state
visit was to china um i guess there'll be some revolutionary figures on the continent um who
might regard china as an ally encountering western imperialism but others may not be quite as hopeful
uh given some of china's um actions in africa can you give us a sense of what you think
of china's role in africa today yeah well i think it's it's we have to understand that the revolutionary
china chairman mao's china is not the china today when african countries were going through you know
the you know places like uh guinea-bissau places like um angola getting support from china that was
revolutionary support right very clearly we want to get we're going we want to topple the west it's it's
this revolution revolutionary moment and china plays off that immensely like china plays off
mao immensely anyway but since mao died this is a different china it is communist china china's
wealth and rise has been predicated on embracing white supremacy right they go into africa and they
exploit in these resources i mean the china is actually exploiting resources worse than europe
i mean some of these deals are insane what are they actually taking away and extracting i think
there's a little bit of a rose-tinted view sometimes of china which i do understand as a counterweight to
u.s imperialism but in terms of some of the actual policies that we've seen you know um the the types
of debts that they've been creating the purchasing of key infrastructures um mines um ports um some would
regard that as its own form of colonialism because africa was underdeveloped it doesn't have the
resources to to mine its own things right it's still mostly conscious deeply poor so they can't
do it they don't want to go with the west the west are terrible the west has the imf and the world
bank who just make everything worse and attach all these conditions whereas china will come in and
say well look we want to do what you like we don't really care we won't interfere in your politics
uh we just want your ports we want your minds we'll give you we'll give you this money right
yeah it's it's just as bad it's it's it's the same pact right and what you see china's done china's
become the workshop of the world they're taking their resources out for nothing they're then
selling them back and packaging them back to africa um i think one uh in nigeria for example when
when china got involved in the textile market they completely collapsed nigerian textiles this is
exactly what the west has done like it's not different like and i think part of our part of
this psychosis is that because they're not white we assume they're better they're not better in fact
china may be worse in the long run i'm not even sure china's not worse um and they'll build stadiums
and you know in fact we're having a convention in gambia in 2026 where we're trying to bring
together a convention of african people we're trying to bring together um as many people in
diaspora and continent as possible and it's in a it's a really nice purpose-built uh convention center
made by the chinese obviously every convention said you want to go to africa made by the chinese
these white elephant projects which aren't really about development for people they just make it look
good their prestige you can it's honestly china's developed china's we have to accept that china is
what malcolm would call a fox the west is the the west is the wolf snarling teeth you know it's racist
you know they want to eat you china's coming in smiling they bear their teeth in a smile you're still
getting a duck house and what about these emergence of these new kind of um organizations in the global
south i mean what are your thoughts about the bricks you know brazil and russia and china um india um and
senegal um and now others who've joined on the idea yeah absolutely who who are sort of uh positing
themselves as a sort of counterweight right to the empire the u.s empire and i guess to the chinese
empire to some extent by by providing a block as opposed to sort of relying on on them exclusively what
do you hold out any hope for bricks i have to say with the bricks i actually don't i think china's
involvement is is is not china china india russia russia russia russia your friend hey russia is not
your friend come on i think if you those three countries in particular have real clear neo-colonial
policies and ambitions um and the the countries are being pulled up on the on white supremacy right
right you need to have people in poverty so if it's involved china i just i and russia i can't see it's
that positive and also going back historically um this isn't this isn't really new so the bangdong
conference in 55 which i even we all grew up like romanticizing these things when you actually read
about it it wasn't what we think at all oh no don't tell me this because i totally romanticize this
this is the third way this is neither east nor west this is you know for people who aren't familiar
with this give us give us a little yeah so mandong brought together it was 55 and it brought together
like um it was the idea of the third world it's not east it's not west you have asian countries
african countries another pan-african leaders were there as well yeah um but it also had the
reactionaries were there too right so the american client states basically had had a whole agenda to
subvert anything revolutionary so anytime they criticized um the west there was some some pro
western stuff and so america was terrified of it at first but then when it actually happened they were
like it's all right nothing changed it's fine we're still in control and i do worry that this is what
you're going to get with the bricks particularly because actually where we're headed is china is rising
but china is not rising as something separate to the west china just taking over the west
right america you think about the way the new age of empire works america took over from europe
and it's likely that china is going to take over from america but the features are still the same
still the same thing and just because china is not white we think it's different but actually the
logic of it is still exactly the same and that's the logic of capitalism presumably even though
obviously this is the maddest thing that we continue to refer to china as a communist country i mean
can you explain this for people who might be confused because i myself i'm confused by it so
so is china actually a communist country no not at all china's not a communist country it's it's
it's a version of it's a version of social democracy right but there's massive so communist
countries don't have massive wealth in them right the idea of communism is that it's all shared ownership
and you just wouldn't have these extremes right um and even you think about the way that the economy
works how is china become rich china's become rich because it's a the the the base point now really
of capitalist production right where do they sell their goods to america oz around the world they
need those markets china needs america to be rich if america gets poor china is also poor right they're
actually together we think they're different they're not different at all and in terms of africa you can
see really clearly what china has done so china joins the world trade organization a cap the most body
one of the most capitalist organization around opening our economy and accepting all the rules of
trade which china would not have done ever in a million years with mao when it was actually a
communist country and it's only since it joined the world trade organization that it started to
invest invest is the wrong word to to releach from africa where it literally has gone from zero
investment at all to massive amounts of investment under world trade organization rules which are
capitalist rules which allow them to completely not only exploit the economy so no china is not
communist internally and globally is definitely not communist it is the foundation stone now of the
capitalist economy and it's worth saying that um it's not just in africa it's also done the same
across asia right oh god is it from the frying pan into the fire like i just feel like you know i
every time there seems to be some aspiration for hope it's like well don't worry the u.s empire is
crumbling there'll be an alternative china china china no so actually for psychologists
the the craziest craziest thing i've ever actually read to the whole book was china which is really
interesting that china in actually it models itself on america economically and consumption patterns
like look at the things that mcdonald's open starbucks all these things open it's just like
a facsimile of america and one of the things that was the most craziest i read was um
in the olympics so it was 84 one of the olympics they watch the olympics and americans doing really well
and they're like oh we need to be new china men like the like the americans we're too small we're
not we're not big enough we need to be like americans and they they basically say this is
because they they milk they drink milk and we don't drink milk and most of the world is lactose
intolerant right most of the world lactose intolerant chinese people lactose intolerance they don't drink
milk so they go and do some research and work out that kids all kids can drink milk and if you
keep milk in the diet you basically can get over lactose intolerance and so they gave this program
to make chinese people non-lactose intolerance so they can drink milk and become like americans
and so you know so now china is one of the biggest milk the milk milk consuming countries
because they want to be like america no that's bad right and now americans all drinking oat milk
anyway what what is going on and it's destroying the world because all these cows they need to produce
his milk it's bloody close the cause of the climate crisis that's i mean if there's anything more
symbolic i don't know what else and milk's even white right like we're literally talking about white
supremacy literally drinking change your whole change your whole population's dietary habits
so you can be like so you can imitate this summer we had the riots across the uk um in which uh black
and brown communities were targeted very overtly uh in racist violence um would you say that those riots
were a symptom of structural uh racism then or and you wouldn't recognize that some of those individuals
should be termed racist or what would what how would you describe those riots then they were racist
rights but the worst way to think about it is they were racist people who caused the racist rights
okay so if we how do we deal with that problem of those rights those are clearly about structural racism
right the the lies that are being told by politicians media etc etc about black and brown people
right the um the economic things which are happening etc yeah um and the targeting clearly
obviously they're racist that's a racist act yeah what we do is we say well look that's because these
these uneducated white people what do they don't know that we've just blamed them put them in prison
that did not solve the problem they are not actually the problem that's a symptom the fact that they're
going out there they're dead they are the individuals are a symptom of the structure right so if
you think you can fix that problem by arresting people that's the worst that's not the problem what
caused it was the structure what caused it was the politicians well cool that's that's the racism
that's what i'm trying to say those people out there they're individually prejudiced um it's
problematic i'm not saying you shouldn't treat it yeah but what we we basically associate we've
conflated actual racism with individual prejudice there are individually prejudiced people out there
yeah um and everything that we've done about racism is how do you stop those individually
prejudiced people i actually think that sometimes the word racism has just become
at least in some people's ears a byword for bad person and so they don't really understand what
we mean well you're just saying i'm a bad person you're just saying i'm evil i'm not evil i'm a good
person okay cool you might be a good person but that at least when i'm using the word racism personally
i'm talking about participation in structures that continue to uh reinforce or maintain uh inequality
within our society along the lines of race right um the people who are devising these policies
are they not themselves also racists i mean i'm looking at the other i was reading an article
about the founder of paypal yeah who is i mean he is an overt racist this man you know grew up in south
africa you know he has he's german he grew up with like a nostalgia for yes born in germany raised in
south africa uh elon was raised in south africa uh these these white people who have a history of
um nostalgia or compassion or empathy for nazism and aryan ideologies they are some of them are actually in
very significant positions of power yeah 100 i think that the elon muslim is crazy you tell
you're surprised the whites in africa does a hitler salute you haven't been to what you haven't been
just in africa i mean i have not that's the least that's the least that's the least surprising thing
ever so i guess i guess the reason i'd say are they racist they definitely look they definitely
prejudiced people 100 yeah and you could say yeah these yeah elon muslim is a racist he's clearly
a racist does racist things the reason i i just don't know how useful it is because then you have
people who clearly aren't prejudiced racist they'll do the same thing yeah right so there's a
participants in the same system participate so for me it's about what is you actually
participating in kia starmer for example i don't think kia starmer doesn't like black people but
i know he'll do policies that don't support black people yeah that's how it is um and i and i so i
think when we say this label of racist it just i don't think it's helpful because it conflates it
way too much as individuals also with white people yeah so if i'm saying well suella braveman she's
clearly like would clearly fit into the she's a racist category but it don't work because she's brown
right so i just i just don't think it's a useful dialogue to say there's racism not racist
okay there's racism there's structures of racism you participate in them you don't participate or
you don't right yeah we had that if we thought of it on that level we just do better things i think
and so just out of interest would you say that um race you so you distinguish between racism and
prejudice right and so prejudice uh being kind of nasty words and opinions that have no material
impact on your life and then racism is something that structurally disadvantages yeah so yeah so as you
go back to that example like clearly elon moss is prejudice he can do racist things though because
there's a system of racism right all these people can only do these things because there are systems
of racism and one thing you cannot get rid of is individual prejudice yeah like there's always going
to be individually i might not like people i've had more prejudice whatever yeah my prejudice is i
can't go out and i can't go at that if i start going around right could be white devils yeah i'll
let them be president right so even in those instances where you have these races these races
right prejudice they can only do these big things yeah because the structure of racism allows them to do it
right and and i mean look i think there'll be a lot of people also looking at the show thinking
well we've had a massive pushback against racism we had the blm process across the world in which you
know thousands of people took to the streets uh you know to protest police brutality um you know
isn't that a sign that actually we as a society are less and less tolerant of racism no we're less
less than that prejudice this is the whole problem right if you think a bit blm what happened it was
all about prejudice even if this the police issue which is a structural issue not not a individual
police officer it all becomes about how do you stop individual police how do you train the police
how do you do this within how do you get more black police officers doesn't deal with the problem
we've all the legal framework that we've had all the civil rights gains that we've had are about
prejudice not actually they're actually about prejudice not racism right and that's been the
problem that's why nothing changes because actually the structure is a structural issue of uh the
role of black and brown people in society which is also not just in britain you can't just solve
that problem in britain it is a much bigger problem i mean and we should know this as britain empire i
mean one of the biggest problems of the way britain thinks about itself is a nation state when it's
not a nation state it's an empire with the largest empire that ever existed so how do we understand
how do we think we can understand racism nationally it's beyond me completely um but yeah the problem is
we focused on prejudice and we actually haven't tackled racism at all in any meaningful way and of
course um i was reading that more people have died uh black people have died at the hands of the police
after the blm protests than prior to that um which you know obviously supports your point um i want to
ask you about these these liberation models that we are uh kind of having to consider given the juncture
that we're at you know i think a lot of people are feeling that mainstream politics is no longer offering
avenues for the the deep forms of social change that are social and political change that are required
um to achieve the ideals that even we as a society uphold as being ours right and uh in that context um
i want to ask you about what those models of liberation look like can we uh rid the system of
structural racism through formal political roots former political roots no right they just not set
up to do it right um we have to understand that the system the system isn't failing it's actually
working right when black people die disproportionately that's the point that's what it's supposed to do
right so every time we see this and go okay well this is this is a problem that's what the system does
every day so the only way to get rid of that is to create a new system this is why we need
revolutionary politics give up on this thing it's not going to work that's why i said don't go be
british give up on it right we need to create different things and i think the biggest trick
that is important on us is to believe that there is no alternative right like when malcolm
was alive 60 years ago when he said revolution you everybody thought yeah maybe right you had
commons revolution panaffering revolution there's loads of solutions and what happened was they
killed loads of people like malcolm uh but the bigger problem is they actually incorporated
enough of us in that we thought everything was better right and so now we don't think
there's an alternative so if we there are alternative models but those models are saying look we need
revolution we need something else that's what black radical politics about saying actually liberate
africa create something new that's actually a solution none of these other things can ever do
can never give us freedom are you saying that beyonce winning a record number of grammys is not a
win for black liberation candy it's probably a loss if i'm honest because you get these tokens put up there
and it just the ludo is actually worse than that and i'm one of the i'm one of the problems i'll be
honest me as a professor is one of the problems 50 20 years actually it's pretty unlikely now that
i'm professor right only 160 black professors in the whole country uh we can't all get a plane
together just in case it crashes there'll be none of us left right that's how few of us there are
so it's pretty unlikely now but then you you make it into these positions and then you get held up as
oh well look you can do it too i promise you if you're watching this saying as using me as a role
model for being a black professor you have more chance of dying in the next 20 minutes probably
than getting into my position that's the unfortunate reality that we live in that's actually nuts um
that's actually nuts um i wanted to ask you about these transnational models of liberation because i
also um am a believer in transnational models of liberation and solidarity
and i obviously malcolm x was a reference both for the black community and the muslim community
um and i wanted to ask you where you see those models of transnational liberation today because
of course you know malcolm x would go to uh algeria he would go to ghana he would travel to places to
create connections between uh grassroots uh liberation movements and create those connections and forms of
solidarity um in order to create a sort of you know a counterweight uh an alternative power base i think
palestine is a perfect example of where you can see this right there's been massive support
across black brand support on this um because obviously we can see what's happening right like
we can see that that what's happening in palestine is the classic settler colonial playbook we know this
we know it's gonna like is this and so palestine is a black issue always has been a black issue
because of that and then that solidarity i think has shown through quite strongly i think um it doesn't
always it doesn't it doesn't always shine through but i think the biggest problem is actually we get stuck
in the nation state right we start to think about you know competing for resources between each other
which is completely problematic right yeah that's that's where you find most of the problems how do
we compete because we because we live in together right we live connected together and we're always
competing with each other that's the main one i keep hearing right is like i've had to fight so hard
hard so this is from um some of my black friends who've done very well who maybe not have not spoken
out on palestine and he'll say things like we have fought so hard to get into these positions
that we can't take these risks where we are today um other people can ask other people but don't ask
us because we've had to fight harder than everybody else to be where we are today and it's easier to get
rid of us than it is to get rid of anybody else and that bit i agree with i do think if anyone's gonna
easily get dropped off flicked off the the board um it will be the newly arrived black elites for sure
um but um i do think that you know that sort of speaks to your point about the ways in which buying
into the system uh you know stops us from being able to recognize those forms of solidarity that bind us
towards a kind of greater goal of liberation um where does palestine fit into the black liberation
movement well as i understand it and i think this is the example you give is really the problem of
getting into the house right when you're in the house that's the house negro mentality right you
can't rock the boat you've got to be within it you've got to and and that's the bigger problem
right and that's why we expect too much of people in that position we might like people expecting
david lammy to be pro-palestine i mean come on i mean he's in tottenham come on we had hopes
the man came on radio said he was english what he said that that was enough for me i don't need to
hear anything else yeah the foreign secretary of the uk is not going to be pro-palestine i think we
just have to admit that that that's that's that's what it is to be in the house right um and so
the question about what sort of the question was what where does palestine fit to black radical
vision yeah always i mean i only care about balestine because of i read malcolm i read
pan-africans i read you know the black panther party you don't even like that when you understand
the world through that lens you understand what white supremacy is you understand the playbook of
it you understand very very very very very very clearly that what happening in in palestine is a
genocide called that genocide for dead for decades and it's and to be honest the only reason the
genocide isn't complete is because of media there is also a huge trend now for black capitalism um i'm
surrounded by uh friends who who have drunk the the black capitalism uh kool-aid and i'm just curious
to hear what your thoughts are on uh black capitalism as the road for emancipation for uh black minorities
in in the west no it's the capitalism is racism so being a black capitalist has been you're a racist
like a racist or racism it's participating in a racist system um i think that's actually one of the
problems with terms like black power they can mean anything honestly you could use black power for
malcolm you could use black power for clarence thomas clearly bad enough might even think she's
doing black power i don't know right so she might literally people might be telling her like you are
winning as a black woman right now i'm joking there's probably a few people saying that oh no that's
that's uh so yeah so i would be specific you say black radicalism that's very specific that is not
capitalism it's not black capitalism that's building alternatives right that's you that's you pull it
pooling our resources not so that we can have like lots of businesses but pulling our resources so
that we can have a different economy right creating i mean the the the long-range program for black
radicalism is um essentially the unification of africa and africa is for now and this is the thing
people really like the mineral wealth is only until the minerals have gone somewhere there won't be any
mineral wealth and then africa is really really really poor right yeah so the goal for black radical politics
is always unify africa africa has enough resources farmland to take itself completely out of the world
system only place in the world that can really do this and if you did that capitalism is over like
it literally ends the next day yeah and so that's the goal for that's that's the radical reason for
and how hopeful are you at uh at the prospect of being able to unify the content uh the continent
given how many you know there have been many attempts uh many proposals what do you see as the main
barrier to the unification of um i guess black people across the world right not just across africa
ironically it's psychosis of whiteness it really is we bought into that psychosis of whiteness that
delusion the thing about all the things you say about education system media they are just as
prevalent on the african continent or in the around the world is there right so we believe that the
west is best we believe in black capitalism we'll get together and have you know we'll do things which
are just bad bad things the african union is a perfect example of pan-africanism gone wrong right like
completely capitulates to the to the west and then to china like african leaders will literally
they'll have summits with europe summits with america summits with china they won't invite
anybody you have to go they have to go chase around the world to each place together all of
them it's like embarrassing honestly ah don't get me started so there are it's it's and it's becoming
worse right and actually you think about migration what people have realized that the african continent
it's not producing for them so what do they do they flee here that's making it worse right because
it's making it even worse so there's so many impediments to it but you still have to be positive
right you still have to believe because the conditions revolution will always be there
i guess you're saying that minorities in general should be doing the opposite of what we're being
told to do in western societies which is to integrate right there's a big focus on integration
and even assimilation as the way in which minorities should behave in majority settings in the west and
you're saying the opposite to that right you're saying don't integrate don't assimilate hold on to what
indigenous or heritage cultures and ideals yeah and always have the the kind of ancestral land as
your reference point yeah what's the point of what we're doing malcolm said uh a better word than sex
a better word than separation is independence so if you look you live in uk you've got to get a job
you've got to do things fair enough but the goal should be what are we how are we actually building
the alternative that should be the goal so even me professor etc the goal should be how can i use my
my platform my resources to build the alternative and that's what we're trying to do harambee
organization of black unity is all about it let's build the alternative we're here we can't not be
here i'm not saying don't get a good job whatever do do what you need to do to eat but long-term
planning long-term thinking should be how are we actually building the alternative because otherwise
we'll just be stuck in this until it ends and that's the other thing this is going to end capitalism
is going to collapse at some point maybe sooner than we think okay i mean you've got the climate crisis
everybody's killed the whole planet like the idea this is going to go on forever is that's a big
delusion in itself yeah so it's it's it's not even it's not even just a case of you should do this
because it's it's a the right the moral thing to do yeah it needs to be done the system the empires
all empires crumble and when this empire crumbles black people will be even worse off if we don't do
something else about you right but so in that sense does what you advocate for overlap weirdly with
what some of these racists are saying that basically go back to your country you're like
yes please hey give me the plate to go god no i mean yeah i mean it is in a funny it's actually
ironic because in the garvey movement universal negro improvement association um had the back to
africa thing and some of the people they had this is why garvey dealt with kkk uh they had these racist
um southern republic republicans were like yeah we'll sponsor a bill to kick you out okay because it did
kind of overlap with that the problem is that garvey had actually and the problem with that that idea
is they it's not just about going back right like i could just go back but
wait like jamaica i mean actually had this on piers morgan said why don't you leave the country
why don't you go and i'm like well what country am i going to because jamaica where i'm from is
probably more white supremacy than it is here uh ghana nigeria any place in africa i might might
hail from is more white supremacy than it is here yeah so it's not about going back it's about actually
fixing the problem and that that is not what they want right that is not you're not going to get
support from uh white supremacy to fix the problem i want to ask you as a final question uh as somebody
who's a big fan of malcolm x that's something we both share and i know that your next book is going
to be about him if malcolm were alive today god rest his soul what would he be saying to us all like
what would he be advocating for well firstly say i told you so like honestly like so the book nobody
can give you freedom i listened to all the malcolm speeches uh interviews and was like this is a
clear theory like proper like lays it all out tells you about white supremacy tells you about a problem
and gives you a solution right and malcolm said look if we follow the civil rights path
token integration what he calls it we're going to end up exactly where we've ended up it's like it's
like a prophet like you listen to malcolm in the 60s like this is what's going to happen and this is
where we are so there'd be a big i told you so uh it also be very angry i think because we do have
access to more stuff now like the idea of unity is so much easier now like internet they all these
things which are kind of terrible also kind of connect us together in a way um and we're just
not doing it right i mean malcolm had to get on a plane for like travel it was so hard to travel around
the country and what we do we're having diaspora wars so malcolm would also be costing a lot of people
like a lot of people and i've cost some of those people in the book so i'm i'm aware and i'm aware
that there was a bit of a backlash yes yes because a lot of people but the big thing he'd be saying
is look the goal is still the same malcolm died he started the organization of afro-american unity
and it was to unite all afro-americans and in the perfect idea of michael means when he said
afro-american he says i mean anybody in south america anybody in the caribbean anybody in canada
anybody in the western hemisphere is afro-american we're all black people we need to unite and then
you unite together with those people in the african continent and you create an organizational
alternative so his vision was basically to build the oau into an organization that subverted nation
state had we all membered in we all paid our taxes into had departments and we ran our own thing
and he left the blueprint for that in 1964. we all ignored it so be like what happened he's like
i told you what to do why no one do it so i think he'd be mad on that sense but he'd still be
pushing the same agenda that's that's the solution for black people anyway that's the black radical
solution how do we build an organization with all of us in it collectively where we can determine
our future and go forward and that's what mac i'm pushing for kayende thank you so much for taking
