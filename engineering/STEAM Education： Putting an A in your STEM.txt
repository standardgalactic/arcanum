so i follow education research pretty closely and something i find interesting is that when
an idea becomes really popular in the education sphere the first place you see it in the world
is usually in like the toy aisle at target like the first time i saw steam so stem is science
technology engineering and mathematics and when you put an a in that we'll get to it it's totally
fine that's steam the first time i saw steam was in the toy aisle at target when all the toys that
used to say stem learning stem now they say steam learning steam even though they're the same toy
it's just that marketers are the first people to co-opt education buzzwords and just shove it
into desperate parents hands be like you want your child to succeed right you better buy the steam toy
like look at this slime it's educational i bet there's a bucket of slime in this box and maybe
a little piece of paper that gives you ideas on how to make it educational but that's that's not what
an educational toy is if something is going to be an educational toy you need someone to have
developed a learning plan like what are the expected learning outcomes for this project and what is the
metric by which you are going to test whether or not the learning goals were achieved otherwise you
know you're just throwing slime at your kid desperately hoping it'll entertain them for 10 minutes while you
get any time to yourself to make dinner and that's fine but that's not an educational toy but they're
selling it to you like it's an educational toy isn't it weird how all the educational toys are the
weird loud goopy annoying toys you would never buy usually but they're educational now
so before we get to steam which is an educational teaching style with a specific set of student
outcomes and goals we have to talk about stem which like funnily enough is not that stem is not
a way to teach science technology engineering and mathematics classes stem it's rooted in immigration
policy which is i don't know that's kind of interesting you can pin this on george w bush in
the early 2000s who like revamped or you could say destroyed public education with the no child left
behind act but also he talks a lot about the importance of making sure highly trained immigrants
don't come and take jobs that americans could not fill which seems like an odd way to phrase that
like i understand specifically as a matter of national security you want to have citizens who are highly
trained and technically skilled and can do jobs and make inventions that can keep our country globally
competitive i understand that that is important it's just a weird way to phrase it as as immigration
policy it's like well no no no we don't want highly trained technically skilled people to come here
and become citizens we want those to be our own people it's like why not both but i understand it
and this is actually how most countries talk about stem you can read about it on wikipedia if you want if
you go to the.gov website on our stem policy that's what you'll see stem in itself is not a way to teach
those classes stem is making sure those classes get taught by providing funding to make sure all
schools offer these classes at the elementary school level all the way up to the high school level uh
schools can apply for government grants in order to like form robotics clubs or get computers in the
classrooms all that stuff so stem by itself is not a way to teach stem classes it is just an
identification of the government's interest in ensuring that we have a scientifically literate population
and we can be globally competitive that's what stem is it has nothing to do with how the courses are
taught when you tell people about steam sometimes they'll laugh at it the person who knows that stem
is science technology engineering and math and they're like so you're just gonna add art
and then you say no steam is about the arts and humanities and they say well isn't that just a
liberal education if you're doing all the science and all the arts and humanities that's just all the
things and i do think that's funny but that's not what steam is so what steam is is a pedagogical
approach to teaching stem courses it takes the critical thinking skills and the creative problem
solving skills you you use in the arts and humanities and it uses those in stem education so it's a way
to design a science course that uses critical thinking and problem solving skills a common complaint
people my age have about their science and math education in high school is that it was just memorizing
fact after fact after fact and there was no understanding requirement it was like if you memorize the
science fact you got an a in science class and steam is an attempt at rectifying that steam wants to
teach you how to understand science how to be scientifically literate a thing that i think is
very important but we'll get into it but that is one of the reasons people laugh when you say steam
it's because they don't really understand what it is yet the second type of person who laughs when you
talk about steam there's a very specific type of person who thinks that they are like morally superior
that they are a better person because they study a stem topic over everyone else who's decided to do
anything creative and i just i can't believe these people exist like it's so embarrassing it's like
pathetic the reason i bring this up is because that type of person who thinks they're they're better than
everyone else because they have an engineering degree also has never read a book in their life so
they have very poor media literacy skills so when i go on to criticize steam education which is a thing i'm
going to do i don't want them to misinterpret this video as me saying artists and humanities are bad
because that couldn't be further from the truth i'm a huge proponent of the importance of a
liberal education like art math science humanities all of it's very important to be a well-rounded
educated person okay so let's talk about steam
i mentioned earlier that people of my generation complain about their education because it was like
rote memorization and that's kind of how science was taught when i was a kid it's just like kepler
did this and so now we know how planets work and then newton did this and now we know how calculus
works and it's just like that is not a good description of science and it's related to the way people
talked about science when i was a child adults would like look children in the face in the 90s
and be like oh you're creative how fun you're gonna live in poverty for the rest of your life but go have
an arts degree and then they would say like oh you're smart go be a scientist like the options were
creative or smart which is so insulting to everyone involved because obviously artists have to be smart
and also science is one of the most creative acts that exists and it's so stupid for people to be
like you know scientists they they don't think they don't think in the open box they just do math or
they're not creative at all like that's such a stupid thing to say steam wants to rectify that
because steam takes this creative problem-solving approach to teaching science the way actual science
works it's obviously a creative endeavor like you look at the data you look at the facts and you
have to envision a solution to that problem that matches all the facts and matches all the data and
gives you an understanding of how the world works i can't state this enough one of the most creative
endeavors a human can do is is to do science okay think of what you learned in high school mitochondria is
the powerhouse of the cell right you have that memorized but what does that mean did you learn
what it means or did you just memorize that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell like
imagine you want an explanation for how human cells have something inside of them that looks a lot like a
bacteria that has its own genome that's different from like your dna in the nucleus of your cell how did
that happen how think about it use your creative problem solving skills how can you go from single
celled organism to somehow having something inside that looks like a bacteria it's one of the coolest
ideas in science i really like talking about that one that's not what this video is about when i first
heard about steam i was like this is brilliant like this is the most important thing that we could do to
improve science education is to teach science how it actually is science is not oh here's the fact
oh i discovered this fact oh i discovered this fact it's all of this information that you have to sift
through and study and understand and put the pieces together like a little puzzle teaching science
as a creative act great idea like think about the boer model of the atom when you learned that you probably
sat in an eighth grade like physics class and they were like here are the energy levels calculate the
energy level at n equals two and then you just wrote it down what if instead someone was like well
here are the facts right they know that atoms are neutrally charged right the the nucleus of an atom
has a positive charge surrounding it are these little boys called electrons that have negative charge
they know that when they look at different chemical elements they see spectra different wavelengths of
photons being emitted how can you take all of those pieces of information and know what an atom looks
like how did boer come up with quantized energy how what a brilliant solution to this problem and you
walk them through the steps why does it have to be quantized little shells why does it have to be
specific wavelengths of photons emitted just what a great way to teach that rather than just like here it is
here's the boer model calculate n equals two please great idea steam education is a great idea
you know um but however let's talk about the bad my biggest issue with steam education is actually my
issue with most hot like buzzword education ideas which is that the researchers have developed this idea
when you talk about creativity and science people remember the science better they remember the
scientific method better they're able to have better scientific literacy skills like later they
can read articles about science and understand what it was happening better because of the way they were
taught these ideas and then that moves all the way to the classroom teacher and how that appears in the
classroom is often very different from how it appears in the research and there's a bunch of reasons for that
and one of the reasons is like education research lag so you have these researchers who work in
academia applying for funding and grants and doing these projects with teachers with students in
classrooms and then they write up a report right they write up some papers maybe they presented a
conference but how does that information travel all the way to the teacher the teacher could get the paper
from the researcher and she could read it um but is she trained on reading scientific documents
probably not like you you become a teacher and you get your masters of education but you're not really
learning education research you're learning how to teach how to do an education right so if she reads the
paper it's going to take her a lot of time to understand when is she supposed to do this so teachers
make like what 47 000 a year they work 7 30 to 5 30 they have to develop lesson plans they have to
develop homework assignments they have to grade homework assignments they have to answer the 75
emails from parents who are like why did my daughter get a 9.7 out of 10 on this assignment
you know and then also they have to teach for seven hours a day all of that in the day when do they have
time to read scientific literature on education they don't right maybe during the summer except
teachers don't get paid during the summer i i'm against people working for free so they should not
but even if they wanted to read literature in the summer they usually have to get other jobs because
rent doesn't stop in the summer because you don't get paid during the summer do you know what i mean
so teachers getting this information directly from the scientists is not as easy as it sounds like i
don't want them to work for free so when should they do that do you know what i mean of course
the academics could be responsible for disseminating their their information to the teachers but
they're also not paid for that they apply for a grant and usually it's like here's the money to do
the research and that's it so on their own time they have to write up the research and present the
research are they also supposed to develop a workshop that they can give to high school teachers and
then they're supposed to travel the country talk they don't have time to do that also they should
not be working for free look at me telling teachers and academics to stop working for free
like that's ever gonna happen stop working for free stop it it's bad to do that whatever anyway
the academics also don't have the time or the money to get this information so there's this huge gap
if you get your masters of education you will learn the latest tools and the latest ideas but then you
just go straight to the workforce you don't go back to school like you're required by states depending
on the state to do a certain number of workshops and all this stuff but you don't go back to school
and start over so there is a lag time between research being done in in academia and that research
appearing in the classroom okay this gap though unfortunately is filled with people trying to
profit off the lack of communication between these two groups you have a bunch of scammers who are like
hey teacher who makes 47 000 a year give me 1200 for this course on steam education and then they
just email out like a bunch of powerpoint slides and stuff that's that sucks like the teachers want
to help the students and so they they look for information and it's just like scammers taking their
money and i mean not all of these people are scammers you also have a bunch of like bossy boss boss
babes who are like i used to be an elementary school teacher but now i make money on instagram
selling courses and like they're not professionally trained researchers they're not they are not the
experts who teachers should be getting advice from maybe they're not scammers but a lot of it's just
really bad information i'm just gonna play one one of the things i'd first like to introduce you to
is using pipe cleaners in your classroom they're not just for little kids anymore pipe cleaners are
great teaching instruments for so many different ways as i talk and i give direct instruction to my
students i know that they're not always going to want to look at my face or the notes that i have on
the board and at times instead of looking out the window i would prefer for them to be looking at what
i'm doing that i don't necessarily need to be paying a lot of attention to but that what i'm doing is
related to what we're learning about so right now you and i are learning about people and teaching steam
so i'm making a little person and maybe if you have a pipe cleaner at your house you might be
following making the little person but if you give your students the pipe cleaners and they make
what you're making then they have a tangible connection now i don't think this woman is a scammer
but saying you're teaching steam techniques and then your technique air quotes i'm so sorry your
technique is to do the exact same science lesson you would have done except hand all the children
pipe cleaners is not steam steam is not adding art and pipe cleaners are not art in that context that's
just a fidget spinner steam is taking the approaches that people do to teach art and doing it in a
science class you can't give the same lesson you have to redo your science lessons and approach science
as a topic in a creative and critical thinking problem solving way handing everyone pipe cleaners
is not doing a steam education and i can't believe she sold this class for money there there of course could
be a reason you hand out pipe cleaners and be like you just do something with your hands while you
watch me talk about science but that's not steam education that's just definitively not steam
education you don't know what you're talking about and you're selling a class this is like 20 years old
i don't i'm sure she's not selling this anymore but it's still on youtube this is the problem right
there is research and there are people who work on the ground and there is a lack of communication with
the two that is just filled with nonsense which is why i think it's not great that we are implementing
steam right now because the teachers i don't think based on what i've seen based on the courses and
things that are being taught and recommended i don't think they know what steam is yet of course
handing everyone a pipe cleaner and saying you're doing a steam doesn't really affect how the course is
taught like you're still just teaching it the same way it was taught before which is not great but i mean
it's not like you're making worse outcomes for your students however my biggest problem with this
widespread adoption of steam is how i see teachers and schools talking about steam because the thing
about public education is that it is not job training stem talks about how to be globally competitive we
need to produce strong technical adults right but that is not how you teach the class you don't teach
calculus and imply to all the students that the only way they'll ever be successful in life is if they
pass calculus and they go on to be a stem career and they keep us globally competitive that's not
what stem says stem does not tell you how to teach the stem classes steam wants to tell you how to teach
the stem classes but people are taking the job search rhetoric about stem and using it in the classroom just
like the 21st century workforce is going to need highly trained steam people we gotta do steam because
we don't know what the job force will be like in 20 years and it's just like i love teachers i really do
do we think teachers should be giving job hunting advice no no we love teachers but the traditional
path of the teacher is like they get their masters and then they become a teacher and they've done like one
job interview in their whole life like your average teacher has worked at their school for 17 years
do you want your 15 year old son to go talk to someone like mr rodriguez who's the best ap english
teacher in the state and say hey mr rodriguez i know 17 years ago you had one job interview can you tell
me about like what employment is like and what a career is like and what kind of job i should get
we love mr rodriguez he's a great teacher but he has no idea he should not be giving
job hunting advice to children because he doesn't know that and we should not expect him to he knows
english and he knows how to teach english and that's what he should be doing have you ever been job
hunting and someone 30 years older than you is like let me tell you what i'd do get your suit on you
know what i mean if you have not been job hunting like traditional first time out of college job
hunting in 20 years you have no idea what it's like and you should not be giving advice and the
way steam education is presented by educators is like we don't know what jobs are going to be like
we have to prepare them and i just how can you prepare them if you don't know what it's going to be
like and also you haven't had a job interview in 17 years this is not your job public school
is not job training like why not just sell all the elementary schools to amazon fulfillment centers
and they can just go to the elementary school amazon fulfillment center and get to work right away
public school is about education it is not job training and it should not be otherwise the
capitalists win okay we want the children to learn the science so they can be good citizens so we
can be globally competitive so they can make an informed choice on what career path they want to
go to it is not the job of the teacher the high school teacher who has not applied for a job in 30
years to tell your 15 year old son how to get an engineering job because they do not know okay it is
crazy to to put that on them it is crazy to suggest that they should they should make predictions about
the workforce no no steam education is not about the workforce steam education is a way to teach science
and math it just paints this like really desperate picture in my brain of like a teacher getting
trained up on steam and every time a seven-year-old student is like i love drawing they just pivot them
into like you know sometimes computer scientists have to make guis that's kind of artistic you should
go do that like imagine how devastating it is for like a child interested in art every time they're like
i would love to write a play they're just pivoted into like you know where writing is important
technical writing for technical manuals you know some people with english degrees can get jobs at like
law firms to write technical manuals how about that like the devastation of taking a child showing
interest in a creative field and just fucking pivoting them every time just like oh you like singing
you know you could sing while you work the oil field they wear headphones no one would be able to hear
you isn't that great like maybe you should go into that you know technical finally this is my very
selfish reason for saying this is a bad implementation of steam education which is that i think art is
important i want children who want to do art to get to do that i want the seven-year-old right now to
write a book or a video game or a movie 25 years from now so that i can read or play or watch that movie
i think art is good hot take and i want children who are interested in that to be encouraged to do
that and i want us as a society to value that art and if we take every single kid and we hard pivot them
into steam because it's kind of art there's kind of art in there that's a real bad i don't like it i want
kids to be able to do art and i want everyone to realize how good it is we all like watching movies
if we get rid of all the artists we won't have any movies i mean we already don't it's just sequel
after sequel after sequel imagine jurassic universe we're gonna have to watch that my biggest fear with
the way i see steam being pushed into schools is that people misunderstand it people think it has art
steam does not have art steam is a way of teaching stem courses to be like creative problem solving we
already talked about it but it is not teaching art teaching art and humanities is separate from steam
but my worry is that six years from now when a school is deciding whether to cut the art program
or the steam program they're gonna look at the steam program and be like yeah there's art in there
that's fine just throw away all the arts just do steam and that's bad i have a fundamental belief
that a liberal public education should be free and easy to get for every single person in our society
and you know civics and calculus and gym class and art class and physics class should all be held to high
standards to make citizens who are media literate and scientifically literate and they have a good
base founding to go on and do the career that they want to do and that includes art and i'm really
worried that this incorrect implementation of steam is just going to shut out art funding and that would
be devastating of course the solution to this problem is to pay teachers more and pay them for
the summer so that they could attend workshops that we pay academics to teach during the summer just like
more money for everyone so that there is time money equals time for these people to learn how to
correctly implement steam into their science classrooms that's the solution but like we'll see it's fine
so i love education research before i went into physics i was getting my master's of education i was
teaching at a public high school like a physics class and after i finished my master's of education i wanted
to do education research like what is the best way to teach science but instead i went and did
physics instead don't i know who cares about physics because i think what is the best way to teach science
is a very interesting question because if you want science to improve and move forward you need a good
founding of science education and what is the best way to teach science what is the research we can do to
discover how to reach the maximum amount of people and make sure they understand how to think
critically and scientifically and when they read a science article they can tell right away if it's
garbage because because they have good scientific literacy skills how do we do that what an interesting
question the problem is it like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the real bad is that it doesn't
matter zero percent of this matters this research doesn't matter if you are lucky enough to live in a
good school district and you send your kids to a safe happy school with teachers who are paid a living wage
and the district has decided they want to implement steam education because it's really important for
the workforce of the 21st century or whatever all that means is that on tuesdays your second grader is
going to attend an hour-long class where they play with legos and do an engineering project i'm not saying
the engineering with legos is a bad project it's totally fine it's just like in the grand scheme of
things it doesn't really matter because republicans have been destroying the public education system
in america for 50 years you can draw a direct line from ronald reagan's attack on college students
protesting the vietnam war to your student loan debt before reagan was the governor of california
college tuition in the state was free his goal was to end government spending on public colleges and
he was very successful the united states is fighting a war which the students in the united
states don't believe in when we set out to try and meet in cooperation with the university the financial
problem of this state recognizing the need to keep the university at its high level we intended to meet
with them around a table quietly when i say we i mean the people of our administration the financial
people the budget department to see how the university which is a large share of the general fund
spending how they could cooperate with us to help us meet this financial problem and not harm the
quality of education and within 24 hours we were being attacked by these people as if we had laid down
an ultimatum and we were out to destroy education and we were out to destroy education you can draw a
direct line from george bush passing the no child left behind act in 2001 to the reduction of public
school funding in every single lower income community in america you ever wonder why you were
so good at math in high school and then you go to college and you have no idea how to study and you
just failed out of the math class you took it's because no child left behind lowered the education
standards in every single school in america you weren't so smart the government specifically
prevented the teachers from providing you with an education you were robbed of your education and
in return you just got a 3.5 gpa george w bush
and we owe the children of america a good education and today begins a new era
a new time in public education in our country
as of this hour america schools will be on a new path of reform
and a new path of results the trump administration passed through school choice reform which was so
far screamily successful as a way to funnel funding from public schools into expensive privatized
unregulated schools and air quotes for rich kids the goal the goal the stated goal which they say allowed
is to get rid of public school education altogether and i would like your your views on uh the relative
advantage of profi measuring doing assessments and using them to measure proficiency or to measure
measure growth thank you senator for that question um i think if if i'm understanding your question
correctly around proficiency i would i would also um correlate it to competency and mastery so that you
each student is measured according to the um advancement that they're making in each subject area well
that's growth that's not proficiency so in other words the growth they're making is in growth the
proficiency is if an arbitrary standard reached a level the proficiency is if they've reached a like
third grade level for reading etc no i'm talking about the debate between proficiency and growth
yeah what your thoughts are on them well i was just asking to clarify then well this is this is a
subject that is has been debated in the education community for years but it surprises me that you
don't know this issue you say a factual statement like the republican stated goal is to end public school
education people are like they would never do that we would never let them do that but they're saying
that's what they want to do and that's what they're going to do if you went to college in california
in 1970 and your total bill for all four years of education was fourteen hundred dollars and i told
you hey in 40 years your grandson is going to go to the same school you did get the same degree you did
and he's going to be six thousand dollars would you say no that's crazy we would never let that happen
because they said that that's what they wanted and that is what's happened when people show you who they
are believe them yes absolutely a person says to you i'm selfish or i'm mean or i am unkind
or i'm crazy or i'm crazy believe them they know themselves much better than you do listen to what
people are saying and it's actually super weird how vocal republicans are about hating education
it's weird right that's what they say out loud republicans specifically hate children and don't
want them to have an education the federal government has provided money and sent it to states
for low-income children to be able to have access to food which they would not otherwise have access to
and the republican governors of those states have decided like no they would rather have the kids be
hungry they don't want the money the money is just sitting there they don't want it they would
rather the children be hungry unless like you know they could just get rid of child labor laws
maybe instead of reading captain underpants the 10 year old could just go work at mcdonald's
i guess like children yearn for the mines the republican stated plan of you know ending public
school education and making children go to work and making sure that they don't have access to food
is in sharp contrast to the biden government at the very start of his administration biden had this
america family plan and it wanted to provide comprehensive paid leave you know like every
other country in the world after you have a baby you get paid leave to spend time with the baby and make
sure you don't die from sepsis it offered universal preschool for all three and four year olds just like
we have public school for five to 18 and this is a huge thing for me problems students have later on
in their education career can be fixed by attending public school because they would have access to a
breakfast and lunch they would have access to trained educators who could recognize signs of them like
needing glasses or needing early intervention for walking or needing early intervention for reading or all of
or all of those things could be provided by people who care for children and got those jobs to do
that by the way here's what the republican vice presidential nominee thinks about universal preschool
universal preschool is literally the one thing we could do that would cost very little but improve the
lives of the vast majority of americans by getting rid of daycare costs by providing early intervention by
giving food to children who do not have access to it and you know there was other stuff like free
community college for two years uh getting rid of student debt increasing the pell grant program but you
know every single republican refused to vote for it so all the good things were stripped and it was just
taken off the table it's weird it's like republicans vocally say that they hate everything that's good for
families and children and vote against it because they would rather the kid be poor and stupid and
hungry which is weird it's like they're not interested in education at all but you know what they are
super interested in children's genitals this is really hard to talk about because it just it's so
disgusting on a visceral level but you cannot talk to a republican about education for more than a few
minutes before they start talking about children's genitals and what bathroom they use and shouldn't
they hire someone to check all the girls genitals before they're allowed to play basketball go to a
school board meeting and there are three people there who are scared of books and also a really
weird guy who just wants to talk about children's genitals and he wants to have access to them so he
can just check it you know just in case i just these people need to be on a list like these people shouldn't
be allowed 200 feet of any space where children are expected to be it's shocking that this is their
platform their platform is i hate children but also i'm super interested in their genitalia hot take you
know but maybe we don't let people who are super interested in inspecting children's genitals make any
decisions about what happens to children maybe they should be on a list somewhere maybe we should check
through hard drives because i i just i don't have words i don't have words let's talk about project 2025
and the future of education under republican governments the things they say they are going to do
i'm gonna read from an education week posting of it but you can just read their wackadoo 900 page document
if you want uh the first thing they want to do is you know get rid of the department of education
they specifically want to close the department of education voting for a republican is voting
to end public school education they want to implement universal school choice a thing they've
already done where you can just funnel federal government money that's supposed to be invested
in the community it's supposed to be invested in children's education and just give it to random
grifters that can suddenly become tax-free education organizations they want to get rid of title one
title one is a thing that was implemented in 1964 by lbj it is because we have this terrible system in
america where public schools are funded by local and state taxes schools that live in poor communities
are going to be worse and be underfunded compared to other schools so title one allows federal funding
to bridge that gap and make sure all schools are on a level playing field it has been in place since the
60s 63 percent of schools are only functioning because title one exists republicans want to close
public schools so they want to get critical race theory and gender ideology excised from curriculum
things that are not in curriculum but the thing about this is like where like a librarian reading
that i have a dream children's book to a bunch of first graders counts as critical race theory
and so they just want to get rid of that they just want to get rid of talking about martin luther king
in school but like do that with everything suddenly talking about unions in a high school history class
counts as critical race theory talking about slavery counts as critical race theory you get it
they can just remove anything they don't want from education because they want you to be stupid
that's the goal but don't worry they're still obsessed with children's genitals project 2025 proposes
defining sex under the federal landmark sex discrimination law to mean only biological
sex recognized at birth instead of you know talking about what the best way to teach science is and how can
we get more kids involved in learning about technology they just want to define biological sex all i want to do
is talk about science and learn science and they want to destroy everything i love if you vote for
republicans you are voting to end public school education sometimes when i talk about politics in
my videos i get comments that are like stick to science stay in your lane science isn't political
and i just have to laugh because that's such a stupid thing to say but also i've just shown you
science is political it's factually incorrect to say science isn't political the people who get to do
science got good science educations the people who get good science educations go to good schools
republicans want to close public schools which means you don't get to do science so many women people of
color queer people have to turn down jobs that just happen to be in states that are hostile to their human
rights if you get into the best school in america to study curing cancer but in that state you're not
considered a human being you don't get to go to that state how can we get to star trek if more than
half the people who want to do science are not allowed to do science science is political because
everything is political anyway i don't want to be a doomer i love america i really do there are so many
great things about the american education system for example i love how our liberal education system
allows children all the way up to 18 to have a broad range of interests other countries
force 12 year olds to decide what career they want to do and qualify for an exam or they just never get
to go to the college they want to in america we have the freedom to follow the career path we want
you know right now so here's just a list of things we can do to maintain this for the future the first
is to vote you know write down the ballot vote for public school education only one party wants to close
the department of education and close 63 of public schools so just vote for the other one also you know
vote in local elections when people run for school board look up when that is on like the random day
look up when that election is and call the people running for your school board ask them how they
feel about steam education and if they start giving you republican talking points you know tell your
friends post on instagram and facebook and say and just say this weirdo wants to close public schools
and he's running for school board don't vote for this guy and get a sign get the sign for your local
election for the guy that knows what steam education is and put it in your yard you have to be
just as vocal as these wackadoos are and this is a big ask but i think we should all make an effort
to go to our local school board meetings because the thing about these freaks is that they are
absolutely a minority these losers drive from town to town showing up at school board meetings and crying
into a microphone about how ramona quimby age eight shouldn't be in the library because she used a
pronoun and i'm scared no one else is there like that insane woman is the only one that showed up
but if we were there to be like whoa it sounds like you need to go to therapy do you even live here do
you even have children here let's stop listening to that woman and let's talk about steam education
this would just go away because this is like one loser driving across massachusetts do you know what i mean
you see if you're there and you're vocal you can just shut them down they are a minority and you know
finally if you're at the school board meeting when one of these weirdos just walks up to the microphone
and starts talking about children's genitalia just have an appropriate response oh my god what the
fuck why are you talking about children's genitals oh my god there are children here why are you at a
school board meeting talking about children's genitals do you think this is appropriate get
out of here and then take a picture of them and call the police because these people need their hard
drives checked
