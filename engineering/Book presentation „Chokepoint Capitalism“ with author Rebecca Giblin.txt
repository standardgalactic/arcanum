creators aren't getting paid that's because powerful corporations have figured out how to
create choke points that let them snatch up most of the value generated by creative work before it
reaches creative workers i'm corey doctorow and i'm rebecca giblin our new book choke point
capitalism pulls aside the veil on the tricks big tech and big content used to lock in users and
suppliers eliminate competition and ultimately shake down creators and producers
we also share tons of ideas for how we can recapture creative labor markets to make them
fairer and more sustainable margaret atwood says we tell how the vampires crashed the party

or read the book for more
oh thank you everybody for coming out um it's so great to be back in berlin and enjoying this
very dramatic weather um yeah so i i guess i'm going to start with march 2020 and i was in melbourne
and my life was cancelled like all of our lives we got a particularly special version in melbourne
with the five kilometers we could leave our house one hour a day and curfew all of the fun stuff but
at least in one sense i was free because i was released of all of the obligations everything i had
promised to do in the grant application i'd written five years earlier because i couldn't do any of those
things and it it was a real moment to ask well what then is the story that i have to tell and i knew
instantly what it was because i had just finished reading this incredible book about monopsony and
this was a word that i wasn't familiar with but it was a concept that i understood very very well
and monopsony for those of you who still don't know the word um it's the inverse of monopoly okay we
know about monopoly because we have a family destroying board game that tells us all about that
it's where sellers are very powerful and they have power over buyers um monopsony is where it's the
buyers who are very powerful and so this this this book crystallized so many things for me and i'd read
it just the previous month but it wasn't like i said it wasn't a new thing i had been in a taxi with
corey doctorow in melbourne about two years to the day before this um and we had been talking about
this same issue even without the word because we found ourselves united with a shared frustration
that you know between us we had something like 35 or 40 years fighting in the copyright wars and we were so
tired of being told that we had to choose like are we on the side of big tech or are we on the side of
big content okay and we didn't that's a false choice we didn't want to choose either of those things
because we knew that whoever won right in the war fought out by those interests all creative workers
would get would be crumbs from the table and crumbs weren't enough so for decades we've had creators
being told that they should devote all of their energy into fighting for more copyright but giving
more copyright to creators in in this economic environment is like giving bullied kids more lunch
money okay you're shaken down at the school gate every day the kid gives up the money the solution
is not to give them more right it doesn't matter if the bullies get so powerful that they can pay off
the principal to look the other way if they can finance an international campaign to say won't
somebody think of the hungry school children right we don't give them more lunch money we give them
guard dogs okay so this is where this uh this this book was born um in in that first month march april
i worked on it by myself and then it was incredible but it was so frustrating because if you tried
arguing with yourself it's not a lot of fun and i just started thinking this would be so much better
if cory doctor wrote this book with me and i don't know if you know this but it's the thing you can do
you can just email him and say cory will you write a book with me and he'll say yes um so good he's not
here he hates it when i make this joke he always says please don't email me a bunch of people have now
emailed him he did say yes to one more so you know maybe have a crack but no um but it turns out he
writes when he's anxious so he has seven books coming out uh it was exactly the right moment
um so i'm i'm gonna start properly now um by telling you a story that i think exemplifies what
we mean when we talk about um choke point capitalism i don't know if this is going to work can we move
forward one thing and see what happens perhaps more pressing we have a one moment signal but i'm
gonna start talking anyway so i'm gonna start by telling you a story that i think exemplifies
and what we mean when we talk about choke point capitalism um and it's a story about the amazon
owned audible so i know in in germany it's a bit less um endemic than it is in english language markets
but in english language countries if if you're buying audio books you're almost certainly doing it
through audible um and a couple of years back authors in these markets noticed that something was up
right their sales were down they were still financing um you know really high quality audio
books but they were noticing that they were getting less and less even though it seemed that the market
for audio books was still growing and they thought that maybe something up was was up with returns
because at this time you know if you were a subscriber to audible you would get these messages all the
time like they would be in the newsletter it's just like oh by the way you know you can return your
your audio books no questions asked right for up to a year after you've bought them right even if
you've listened to the whole thing even if you loved it and people would go on the go and get the the
tech support and they would ask and the the tech people are like yeah it doesn't matter you know it's
it's fine if you loved it so people got the and you know they would finish the book and they would
get a prompt saying would you like to return this book and so people started to think well if i say it's
like a library right i return it i get my credit back i get a new one okay terrific but what they
didn't realize is that every time they returned a book the royalties were being clawed back from the
author right and the authors weren't being told that this was happening so there was no transparency
around the accounting for this the authors would only get reported their net sales so sales after returns
so audible knew that what it was doing was not really okay and it was obscuring what was going on
but then one day there was a glitch and three weeks of returns data showed up in a single day
and so suddenly people were just like what do you mean i sold minus 200 books today right and they
realized the scope of what had been going on that there was this huge heist that was happening
so what was going on here so amazon has actually like this is this is a playbook that we discovered
as we were writing this book we discovered that um that this was a playbook that amazon had had made
famous with a diagram they've they're so proud of it that they've made a diagram about it
but we realized that it was a playbook that was being used in all kinds of creative industries but also
other industries as well so corey and i made another video explaining um first of all how amazon
explains this and then unpacking what we think is really going on
so let's have a little look at that here's how amazon describes its flywheel
lower costs lead to lower prices which create better customer experiences translating to more traffic which
then attracts more sellers and thus a better selection that improves the experience even more
and the cycle continues amazon calls this a virtuous cycle but it's not virtuous it's anti-competitive
here's what's really going on amazon's strategy has always been to lock in its customers
one way it does this is by putting digital rights management on ebooks and audiobooks which
cements readers to kindle and audible another is by offering fast free shipping to prime members
once you pay your annual fee amazon becomes your default whenever you need to buy something
locking in its customers lets amazon lock in its suppliers too
publishers and small businesses can't afford to give up access to amazon's increasingly large
share of the market so they keep listing their goods there even when that's bad for their business
long term amazon's lower cost structure is just a euphemism for shaking down its suppliers and workers
amazon uses its market power to demand steep discounts and high fees from those other businesses
as a cost of selling on its platform it uses that money to subsidize low prices
which has the effect of eliminating competitors who actually pay fairly
as time goes on that means amazon suppliers have even less choice those low prices also lure more
customers who then get locked into amazon's platform as well the shakedown grows more merciless and
damaging as amazon's flywheel spins faster and gains ever more momentum
that returns policy was about locking in users that really generous returns policy was only offered to
those regular monthly subscribers right um not people who just bought an ad hoc uh one every now and
then what amazon or audible was interested in was getting those monthly fees no matter what
and they didn't care who paid for it right they didn't care where that money went and so
if you think about it anybody who starts up a rival audiobook platform and wants to actually pay
creators fairly has really a big hill to climb in order to compete with this um and audible made authors
pay for it like you have to admire the elegance of what they did um but as i said it wasn't until
we were quite deep into researching this book that we realized it wasn't just amazon that was doing
this this is the same playbook that's being used in creative industry after creative industry um can we move
to the there we go um so say what you like about capitalism but competition is supposed to be
fundamental to it but for 40 years we've been told not to worry about increasing market concentration
because anytime a company gets an advantage it's going to be competed away but then what we've seen
over that same time period is this concerted project um of turning those supposedly temporary advantages
into more enduring ones right and they've got really successful at it and to the point where and
and and brazen too to the point where they say the quiet part out loud we have peter teal saying
competition is for losers and warren buffett talking about how he'll only invest in companies
that have these wide moats ie barriers to entry that stop other people coming in and and doing that exact
thing of competing in a way and this is what's taught now in business schools right if you're in business
school you're told that well if you actually make something that people need or provide a service
that people need that'll get you regular rich but if you want to get stupid rich and they all want to
get stupid rich you've got to create a choke point you've got to position yourself between the people who
actually make the things and provide the services right and mediate your ability to control and
position yourself between those people and the people who need them
and then use your ability to mediate access to extract more than a fair share of value okay
and so this is the project right and because um and and it's a little bit different in germany
but because um the globalization of corporations means that what happens in america ultimately ends
up affecting all of us anywhere in the world they adopted something called the consumer welfare standard
right as a a new way of understanding competition law right that sounds like very very boring and
dull you don't want to hear me talk about this very much at all but what that standard said is effectively
is if if it doesn't have um the effect of raising consumer prices the competition regulators aren't
going to care and so what that meant the message that that sent to these corporations is shake down
your workers and your suppliers now of course it has exactly the same end result right when you're being
shaken down right when you're getting that downward pressure on your wages you have less and less ability to buy
the goods and services that you need right it's the same end result as if the prices had gone up
but in a way where there's not going to be any kind of intervention from regulators
and so in the book we show that creative industry after creative industry has been
choke pointed um and they achieve their lock-ins with different tools right um
um sorry oh there we go um recorded music they really use these like massive reservoirs of copyrights
we've got three record labels that control um almost 70 percent of the global recorded music market
and they own three music publishers that control 60 percent of global song rights
um and they use they use that and because they they have these rights for such an incredible long time
um you know it it it can be depending on the right like you know 70 years 90 years over a century for the song rights
um this allows them to control the future of music markets in ways they shouldn't be able to do
because we don't need record labels in the same way as we used to for streaming we see spotify and
deezer these other companies using playlists to try and get us to outsource to them the decisions about
what we put in our ears and then they are the ones um that that that are deciding and that gives them the
power um over the artists ebooks and audio books digital rights management's been very big and there's a
whole range of other tools but no matter what tools they use to choke point the market when they succeed
it always results in the same thing and corey's term coined a terrific like there we go where should
i be pointing to make this a little more seamless in just randomly okay to you guys okay terrific thank you
he calls this in shittification right um and when he coined this term what he explained is that
platforms when they start up they first direct their surplus to users right to get the users to come
there and to want to be there and then once the users are there then they redirect the surplus to the
suppliers and then once they're locked in the surplus gets poured into the pockets of the investors
right and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit right which is how we've ended up with you
know an internet that's now sort of you know five services with all full of screenshots from the other
four um and the aim is to make it just this side of bad enough that you don't leave elon musk has sort
of fucked it up at this point with twitter it's just tumbleweeds now um but mostly people have been pretty
successful at doing that and we focus on the creative industries but once you start looking
around you start seeing that there are choke points and in shittification everywhere so that's the
problem but i think the much more interesting question is what do we do about it how do we widen
these choke points out this is not like we we were determined that this wasn't going to be another one
of those chapter 11 books like we've all read them like 10 chapters about how terrible everything is
and then like one chapter at the end like we don't really have time to get into what to do about it
but a bit of hand waving about maybe vote harder um we get really into the weeds um and it's really
important to know what kind of interventions actually work here because the the traditional kind of
competition law remedies uh don't work particularly well when it comes to monopoly but for various wonky
reasons they're much much worse when it comes to monopsony that excessive buyer power that we've
been talking about but we know that there are some interventions that do work and they're things that
encourage new entrants into markets that directly regulate excessive buyer power and those that
build countervailing power in workers and in suppliers um so i'm just going to briefly talk about some of
these and the the one that gets me really really excited is transparency right you cannot fight an
enemy if you don't know what they look like um and that was exemplified really by that story that i began
with right the authors suspected something was up but it wasn't until there was that data glitch that
shone a light on what was happening that they really knew what was going on and they had something to
fight and that enabled them to mobilize they created this incredible campaign they had a hashtag audible
gate and they put on together enough pressure to get audible which is um you know as one of the
amazon companies notoriously secretive notoriously reluctant to share any kinds of information did get
them to provide more information to separate out returns from sales and to reform some of the most
egregious parts of that returns policy so that the royalties weren't being clawed back in the same way
um we still don't actually know right whether they're paying authors correctly um and there's like
reason to suspect that they're not we need a lot more pressure in order to to to to figure out what's
going on and to try and reform that um but it's better it's the same thing when it comes to record labels
you know one of the the the quotes in the book is about this um auditing company based in the states that had
done tens of thousands of record label audits and only once do they ever find an error in the artist's favor
i don't know it's i don't know what's going on here like some kind of isolated probability storm like imagine
tossing a coin that many times and it comes up heads always right um it's very suspicious
the the music publishers as well um when i was at south by southwest this year the songwriter autumn
row told me her royalty statement is three thousand dollars three thousand pages okay three thousand
pages she can't even figure out what a unit is right and she got such a headache she had to go for a
massage and i think she said that the massage cost more than the amount of royalty she got from that
three thousand pages printing the thing would cost more than like the amount that you actually get paid
and molly crabapple has has i think put it really well when she talks about the effects of opacity
which is that not talking about money is a tool of class war a culture that forbids employees from
comparing salaries helps companies pay women and minorities less we require transparency in a bunch
of different situations particularly for shareholders for investors right um so why don't we require
this for creative workers the systems theorist stafford beer tells us the answer when he says
the purpose of a system is what it does
the digital single market directive has been really welcomely um created new mandates around
and new rights that member states have to implement around transparency i think this is a really great
model the implementation is tricky because you've got these powerful corporations fighting any kind of
meaningful implementation in every country but this is the right kind of thinking
interoperability really important as well right you need to be able to exit the platform okay um that
means taking your books with you taking your audio books with you we want to see we want to be
thinking about minimum wages for creative work right anytime you've got massive inequality of bargaining power
freedom of contract means freedom to be shaken down and creative workers are particularly vulnerable to this
because humans have to create you know we all know the feeling of like you know you have a story
that has got to come out or a poem or a drawing or a painting or a piece of code our people's
people's people's passions are exploited to facilitate their their weaponized to facilitate their exploitation
um we need to see as well more meaningful limits on copyright contracts we need to have people
less to give away there's definitely another slide coming um
really meaningful reversion rights okay time limits on contracts use it or lose it rights again the dsm's
heading in the right direction there
collective ownership really important too and again that's facilitated by things like
interoperability rights to exit um platforms but we need to be thinking about how do we finance this
how do we capitalize projects one of the big difficulties that we face is that there is so little money
right for creative work and when we we look at the trade book industry for example it's particularly
insane it's absolutely bonkers if anyone has ever broken down the economics of this the the answer is
there is no money in publishing but if we have a look at to the retail share right the part that amazon
takes the there's some wiggle room there so we could be looking at um at cooperatives owned by authors
if we were able to facilitate that to get started and collective action i think some of the most hopeful
parts of the book are where we talk the stories about where that's really worked out
and hopefully in the discussion we can talk a little bit about the writers guild strike that's going on at
the moment we worked closely with the writers guild of america when we were writing this book
they were ran for 22 months um a strike after 7 000 hollywood writers fired their agents all in a
single week right and they managed to reform some really abusive practices they're out again fighting
tooth and nail for economic dignity and the ability to keep their their industry afloat right now
um and the final thing that i want to maybe perhaps talk about is about generative ai which is one of
the things that the the writers guild is fighting around at the moment because they're seeing the
possibility that we're going to have writers rooms that are no longer vibrant places but where you've got
a single isolated worker editing scripts that the robots came up with and the idea that we're going
to have the humans doing all the drudge work while the machines are free to make the art this is not a
world that i want to live in um the these technologies are not being developed by people who care about
making the world a better place it's exactly the same stuff right there's they're there to extract
value from the people who make the things and put it in the pockets for the people who already have
the money don't believe the hype man right it's not going to become sentient right it's not going to
take one in every two jobs but there are real threats right these technologies are going to seriously
disrupt a lot of labor markets they threaten to make the work that we do worse right they're going
to be used to surveil us and to discriminate amongst us um and to increase our disconnection
from other humans um but i think they also present a really exciting opportunity and that's
what i want to end on here um synthetic you know synthetic voice models allow other people to put words
in our mouths um generative video allows people to get our bodies to do things that we never consented to
these are intensely personal things and i think they they are personal in a way that focuses attention
on what it means to be human and what's due to us as humans as distinct to what's due to machines
but also as distinct to what's due to corporations and so rights to self perhaps is a thing that we
we might talk about we need to have a world where there's self-determination right where we weaken
and corey put it i want to end on corey's words that competition is about self-determination
that we need to weaken the power of intermediaries who would otherwise take away our ability to lead
our creative and human lives in a way of our choosing who would and do force us to arrange our lives to
benefit their shareholders no matter how badly that works for us it's time that we recognize
our commonalities figure out who really are the class allies and figure out how to live good lives
thank you
all right thank you so much rebecca that was wonderful um we're going to move into the panel discussion part of
the evening now and i'm very happy to be joined by justus trailing the policy director at communia
an organization which advocates for policies that expand the public domain and sandra toster a an
independent filmmaker and digital storyteller as well as of course rebecca um so yeah we've got we've
got a nice combination of people policy expert creator or whatever this is yeah too many things to
say in one in one phrase but you've hopefully read the book you understand what where where rebecca's
coming from um and i want to spend most of the time today talking about solutions and the more
you know the practical things that we can all do um but just to start with i wanted to recap a little
bit on how the structures that you talk about in the book rebecca are affecting how creative products
are made these days i'm thinking about examples that you mentioned like um how music is being composed
with spotify playlists in mind i think it was drake's album that had like 24 seconds long yeah like
25 tracks it's just designed for streaming um sandra can you talk a little bit about how
yeah how that affects kind of the film world and what you're seeing yeah i think it's kind of the
thing and um it's a little bit hidden because um the german system is special when it comes to uh filmmaking
because it's all everything film i think is is funded by public money so um this this is a point what we
have to think about um but it's not it's it's always um it's not um funded um 100 it's a performance
related loan um and uh it's an economic funding so you get perhaps for a documentary 80 percent and you
have to get the 20 from somewhere else so you have to sell it and you have to sell it it's in the law and
the contracts and you have public tv uh which is also not um paying for 100 of the um cost for the
production so and film is very expensive so we really relate on um it's not working no it's not
working so um we really relate also on the people who give us the money to do this and so this is the
public funding and but also we have to sell and where can we sell so um cinema is kind of i don't want
to say it but it's that kind of um the the numbers going down and down and down and so um you only
have the possibility to sell it online and um you don't get the audience if you are not with the big
streamers and they tell you what they want they tell you the formats they tell you the content they
tell you uh the the way how you have to make it the drama and i'm a documentary filmmaker so i think this
is especially difficult because we're talking about culture and um so yeah that's kind of the situation
i could talk about this for the next three hours but you don't want to hear it yeah yeah thanks so
much sandra um justus communia has a set of policy recommendations relating to the policy to public
domain number seven being the freedom to create should be protected at the eu level i feel like
that's ultimately what we're talking about in lots of ways here um could you tell us more about what
that looks like in practical terms and what drove you to come up with that one yeah i think thank you
very much i mean that one in particular is maybe um a bit tricky because it actually um relates to um
you know um different things maybe um in in terms of how we can use platforms etc but i think what we
advocate for and what what i think is really um interesting uh directly connects to what rebecca has
said which is transparency so um those policy recommendations we came up with them um after copyright
reform after the digital market directive was passed uh now i think four years ago and um we
thought okay um what can we can we ask for um for the next decade basically to make european copyright
better for users but also for creators and and i think uh that was really crucial for us because we
also felt that the narrative was pretty much you have to decide and you you get this false choice that
you mentioned you have to decide whether you're on the side of of big tech basically or on the side of
big content because basically um creation was was seen as something that that was only supported by big
content right and and um you had all this talk of the value gap in the eu and that's how we got the uh
the upload filter debate of course right i mean um everybody will remember that that part um and i think you
you you do a great job in the book where you describe this as as basically um further locking us in on the youtube model
um because i mean upload filters ultimately mean that you have to have the technology uh to run a platform
and who has the technology well you know one company has mastered content id and that kind of locks you in
uh on on on their business model and i think just uh to finish my thought here what what we said is
basically we if if we want to break this um this pattern um we we really need to um ensure that creators
can again connect with their audiences and understand who's listening to their content who's watching
their content who's reading their books etc um and that's why we also very strongly push for for
transparency in those recommendations do you want to add um i might mention that actually in the film
industry in the uk they have something called terms of trade which is it was introduced in the early
2000s do you have anything like that here yeah we have but um a lawyer once told me we missed this
kind of we have it but it's not that strong okay so like the the uk i'm going to tell you a tiny bit
about this uk example because it has really turned things around and i think it can provide inspiration
for us in in other areas as well so what they realized is that in sort of the early 2000s the big
public broadcasters in the uk like the bbc and all of those those other ones um they were they were
buying they were commissioning film and then they were like they had these these contracts that were
just really broad um and kind of took everything but they weren't really using everything like just
because you take something and we see this in so many different creative markets doesn't mean
you're actually going to exploit it lots of people have asked us about a german edition of the book
we do not have a german edition of the book i cannot sell a german edition of a book to a publisher
because our our us publisher has the world rights um and they haven't managed to sell a german edition
but in the uk they they they decided that they were going to change the rules and so they created this
thing called terms of trade that said that the the when the the public broadcasters commissioned things
from independent producers they were only able to do it on certain terms so for example they weren't
allowed to just take all the international rights as well they separated out the the domestic commission
from the international rights um and they they also restricted other things so there's other things
you can do like restrict the time that the that they have the rights um change there's the the the
entitlement to to stream it and and the entitlement to put it on the the broadcast television and so
on just separated all of these things out and said you have to bargain for it separately and you have
to keep bargaining for it okay if you want to keep putting this on your your online player for people
to view right you you buy those rights again and this has had a massively beneficial effect on the
independent production sector in the in the uk um they've massively increased their exports of uk
material because those the people who actually make it really care about getting it out there and
they do actually exploit those rights they're out there hustling right and when when the the the
the media is still being um viewed and sold then they've got the ability to keep selling it um
domestically as well and so i think that breaking the rights up like what like that um and that's what
when we're talking about like having meaningful reversion rights um and and limits like freedom
to contract sounds really really nice until you think about what that actually means in practice
um and i'd like to but yeah we have something similar but not that strong as i said before
but at the end um for me as a creative person i uh if i work with a producer i normally produce myself
but if i work with a producer normally i i have also i ever have a total buyout yeah so um it's good for
the producer and they're also struggling the independent producers you know but um then we have to go
a step further and to have also this um terms of trade for the creative peoples yeah exactly exactly
so we're um we're sitting here at wik media um wikipedia is as you know volunteer driven creation of
free knowledge i'm curious how you all see the interplay between volunteer driven initiatives um
designed at promoting knowledge free of charge and creating creating open knowledge in that sense
and the challenging circumstances that you describe in the book
um so i i think what i ended on um i suppose was just hinting at this idea of of what is it that
that makes for a good life right and i think that humans are terrible about knowing what that actually
is we're very resilient okay um but you know did you have this in germany this idea that of the frog
in the pot of water and it gets warmer and warmer and warmer and the frog never jumps out
this is the frog jumps out but do you know who doesn't jump out humans like we we we let our pot
get warmer and warmer and warmer and we don't jump out um and i i think um when i think about wikipedia
and i think about what drives us is this human urge towards cooperatism um to making the world better
for each other people do it um for many many um from many many intrinsic motivations that are not the
things that we're told that we we need to be driven by and i think that's really similar to why a lot of
people create other stuff that that we love um as well and like to me art and culture are the the things
that make it bearable to be human um but somehow even though it's the most important thing it's the thing
that we don't put an economic value on it and it's almost like we have to because humans are inherently
cooperative and and creative um we don't have to pay them to do that but we do have to pay people a
lot of money to to disconnect and to extract and to to be the inverse of that so that's why you need
to give so much money to corporate lawyers and the merger and takeover people and the all of the
assholes and even then when they have enough money right then all they want to do is like start a
candle making business in their bathroom or like give it all the way through a a a a charity or some
such so what i what i think i see the relationship as is that there there is such strong motivations human
motivations to to to connect to be part of a bigger project um and what we have to do is find a path
through that enables us to do more of that and to understand what really is valuable um and i think
that's i'm just going to blame this uh incoherency on the fact that i just arrived from australia a few
days ago and haven't stopped since doing great hopefully there is something that made sense in that
maybe eustace you could uh there's nothing to fix really i think that that's that's true i mean
um i think we have those projects and they kind of stand in in contrast to the the business model of
the the large tech the big tech platforms uh in in a way that we see that as you said people want to
cooperate people want to jointly create content people want to create something for others to enjoy
basically even without asking for remuneration and i think the challenging um and unfortunate part is
that sometimes rules stand in the way of that right not just rules also kind of um societal structures
like you know corporations uh but but also just laws i mean um if we look for example at a copyright i mean
sometimes it becomes very challenging um to use certain kinds of content on wikipedia wiki comments in
particular but um and and and that for us i mean i i think should be um you know yeah that for us is
a reason to to become active in policy work also to remove those barriers and and make it easier uh to
create on on on those platforms because i think ultimately want to further those structures um that
really help us come together as a society and build something useful on the internet and not just consume
the stupid content all over again and i think that really relates to your first question the freedom
to create is kind of our idea is there um that people should be um able to for example remix um and
reuse content that is already there and that is notoriously difficult especially if it's copyrighted
content i mean there are some good reasons for that but there's also some bad reasons for that so if
you want to you know create a hip-hop song use some samples good luck i mean if you're not drake
or somebody like that um i think you're not going to succeed even if it's just for pleasure and not
to generate income off of that so um and and there we can really see i think some some examples where
you know our laws could be better our copyright rules i think in particular could be better
um yeah to to enable um this kind of co-creation could i just i also wanted to add something um i i told
you before that um we really depend on public money so um i did an experiment once with a film and uh i said
to the people okay if it's financed 100 percent so it's something like a total buyout um you know total
buyout is normally more because you have to count in all the social things and um so i said i gave it
away for under creative commons license and um this worked you know the financing but i managed to do
it and um yeah at the end it was really good for me because i make movies um for watching them and not
for the draw of the distributor and uh so um but on the other side uh i tried to uh publish it under
creative commons and for movies it's really difficult at the end i ended on wiki comments but
this was also really uh really difficult because it's not made for it and i think it would be good
all these projects for example like wikipedia um you know to push them a little bit more into into a place
where um where you can ex we can where you can do stuff like this yeah not just being on youtube
uh to find a home somewhere else something good it's not economic driven it's it's uh it's for the
society and uh on the other side we have the public money which is not 100 which is just a little
bit more so we can have have it all you know use the public money to have a public value and uh yeah
but then we have to come together all of us you know the law the state the um the filmmakers everybody
have to come a little bit closer together i did want to just clarify that just because people will
create for um intrinsic motivations that doesn't mean that we should not allow people to live with
economic dignity and to have like the scope for professional creativity and this is i think really
critical and one of the more radical things that we talk about in the book when we get to proposals
is the idea of a jobs guarantee um that provides like it's sort of an alternative
um in in the event that the what's what's what's on offer from the the private sector is so unattractive
that you could step into this this other kind of of world and some of the inspiration for this is
comes from in the us the new deal and they didn't just finance infrastructure it wasn't just that
they made all the highways with this they actually financed thousands of creative jobs during this and
so if this is something we really value and again i think that this this um this emerging era of
generative ai is going to turn our attention very quickly to do we care about having humans telling
stories and making art or is it fine if there are pretty things made by machines do we want to feel
something um then if we want that then we have to find a way of paying for it yeah i mean one of for
me one of the like the most compelling things about the book rebecca was the argument that it's not just
big tech and big content that are that are trapped with choke points it's literally everything
it's it's it's every it's every market it's every it's everyone in lots of ways well if there's
not a choke point there's somebody out there trying to figure out a way how to make one yeah
all right yeah that's a better way of describing it for sure um and you talk about how for this
problem to be solved for big tech and big content we all have to work together um and that's really
exciting that there's opportunities for real solidarity and cooperation um and i'm curious how
you all see kind of like what does that look like practically speaking for all of you i mean
reiki mentioned kind of collect you mentioned a lot of around the solutions but like collective action
you mentioned the writers guild could you say a little bit more about that yeah perhaps i could
start with one of the stories that i i love the most that's in the book is about the the uber drivers
um who turn the tables on uber so they are some of the most like atomized vulnerable exploited workers
that are out there they are surveilled they are rated they are dehumanized um their work just continues
to get worse and again it's that in certification right at the start that they were brought in there
um and it was it was better than the alternative of driving a taxi and it just got worse and worse
and worse and worse but now you know in a lot of places there are no taxis so you're they're stuck
there and one of the things that that was done to them was systemic wage theft but they also had
contracts in the united states that said that they were um they were not employees they were not entitled to
employee protection if you're in the united states you're not and you're an independent contractor
you're not entitled to unionize so like the the weaker and more individualized you are the less
likely you are to have like worker protections um and those contracts said that they didn't have the
right either to bring a class action right if there was anything that went wrong they only had the
right to individual commercial arbitrations so this is already a terrible injustice right because
commercial arbitrations um they are paid for by the the corporation we know that the the arbitrators
tend to find in favor of the people who are paying for them they don't have any precedential effect
um and you can't like work together to make them but these uber drivers like with the deck stacked
against them so intensely right some of them figured out but what if we all coordinate and tens of
thousands of thousands of us at once all bring a commercial arbitration action so it's way cheaper
for uber to fight one commercial arbitration action than a class action but really really expensive
like every arbitrator in california was like taken up with these all right the cost was just absolutely
prohibitive uber ran to the court and said don't let them do this this is really unfair right and in
the end the workers got 150 million dollars um you know through this coordinated action and i think
that um when we come back to the workers guild uh that sorry the writers guild um when when we had
the launch day for this book uh in in the us we we had an event in hollywood and david goodman who was
the president of the writers guild during that last strike and who is the um is the lead negotiator on the
current one he said um he gave the story of saying that we we thought that our agents had power we
thought our agents had all of the power and then my wife said to me actually you can have hollywood
without agents but you can't have hollywood without writers and we re when we realized that
we had the power that that changed everything and i think that we have to realize that we are part
of this greater whole and that's what i talk about what does i mean i suppose when i talk about
realizing who are the class allies here um and working together and rejecting rejecting this
extraction yeah i mean i i fully agree i mean i think it's about changing the narrative and and
also as somebody who's working from users rights perspective mostly i don't claim to represent creators
um but but i think what we what we are trying to do is ultimately to make copyright work for everybody
uh in in the in the kind of and yeah and the whole system uh and that that means users and creators
it's not users versus creators it's not people who want stuff for free it's not us supporting some
kind of you know big tech company or anything uh if we you know speak out against upload filters it's
because we want to protect freedom of expression it's not because we want to see uh the money uh go into
the pockets of you know big company companies it's uh and i think that is something we really need
to work hard on because um that there's still i think a lot of divisionary uh rhetoric uh in in
the space and a lot of difficulties of of building those uh relationships and building those alliances
i just had a flashback of uh you know i think us meeting for the first time at the world intellectual property
organization a couple of years ago uh extremely boring topic but i think you gave a presentation
about reversion rights and i remember that somebody from you know an author's organization was very
angry about this um which doesn't make sense i mean you know reversion rights are very useful for
for artists and especially for writers but i think you know those organizations are they they've existed
for a very long time they're very close to publishers organizations uh sometimes and and that makes it
very challenging to really counter this narrative and and come up with something new and i and i think
um yeah i mean also i mean maybe we have to become a bit better at kind of um you know the solutions um
that we develop but but yeah i think it's it's mostly about changing the narrative on this one
yeah i think you you said all what i what i think um and it's it's really the narration of it and and
the changing the point of view and uh not just um you know um going the traditional way and you know go
more to digital rights management and you know stronger law and uh so this doesn't work and uh but this
this uh digital world is so different than the the old analog world that sometimes i feel like it's
chinese and on the other side it's arabic or something like this and they don't understand each
other and i stood for a long time in the middle of both and i think we really have to find kind of a
language um you know to to help each other and to find a way out of this i think this is really a big
point and to change also the the value of of creative workers is also especially in films it's
also often related to making money but it's not that's not always the main value you have to make
it that's not what i mean it's you you you need money to make it and especially film is very expensive
but um you have to change your mind to get this money at the end yeah um and i guess just to end
on a note of hope before we go to questions from the audience briefly let's say a question for all
of you let's say it's 20 years from now you all got everything that you want rebecca people read the
book it had the impact you're dreaming of justus all of commune's policy recommendations get adopted
sandra everyone watches your films everyone you know you get calls from people that you
asking you to make films with them what does the world look like in 20 years from now if you get
everything that you want related to this topic but does it really happen yeah i mean because i i
actually i want to say if if if all of this happens right i think that there is a broader
thing that we can hope for that people are living lives where they're not super anxious and running
at a million miles an hour always feeling like they're not enough because we have got this growth
mindset and everything has to be more and more and more every time that we are not having to do the
bullshit work um to distract us from the fact that maybe we're not really having the life that is
nourishing us and that is giving us what we need everything slows down there's more love and there is
more connection um and we don't need we don't have that emptiness inside of us that needs to be
filled with ever more production and ever more consumption thank you sandra it's really difficult
you know think big yeah um i hope the world is a little bit better because you know in my case
i'm talking about documentary movies it's not all what i do i also do other stuff but um you know i'm
i'm reflecting the society and i hope um this this kind of a feedback loop helps and if more people
watch this stuff and not just you know mainstream entertainment stuff for you know being calm and
easy perhaps the world is a little bit better i don't know just i mean i think as a policy person
if you do your job too well you're out of a job uh of course uh i mean but but no to be honest i
don't think that all of our policy recommendations will be implemented so i i think i will still have
a no in this question they are yeah yeah i know i'm trying to to accept the assumption but but but
in my world you don't need a job anymore because everything is basically basic income for everyone
no i mean i i won't be spamming corey doctor or to finally co-write my book with them i think
maybe i'll take your uh your hint there but no somebody will have to um to make uh to work to
maintain the system also right i think otherwise it's it's a constant struggle and and and some people
will come up with new technology um as you know you mentioned generative ai but there might be
something different on the horizon and i think we we constantly have to ensure uh that the system
is uh adjusted uh to the needs uh of of you know people and not just to the needs of technology
and so yeah i think that that will be kind of um my job then maybe thank you all right i'm going to
open it up to questions from the audience yes good evening um if there was a encyclopedia publisher
sitting on the on the podium uh they would tell you about the kind of evil monopoly that wikipedia has
created in this market um rendering it impossible to make honest money by selling knowledge and
making any future endeavors impossible to start new projects because um wikipedia's licensing model
has basically and its prominent place in search engine result pages has created some kind of a
monopoly or a choke point um for them so my question is two part first would you um
would you see some of the choke points you described being mirrored in successful open source projects
in some way or are they of a different nature or are they actually beneficial to some extent
and secondly you talked about the generative ai and as far as i can tell uh wikipedia content is
usually at the heart of any large language model um or image creation model uh with its um wikimedia
comments uh project sister um do you have do you all have any recommendations on how wikimedia should
react to being in such a central position um by providing something that might in long term
change society to some extent great thank you so much who wants to well i i think the nature of of open
is like fundamentally contradicts the idea of a choke point right so the fact that it's openly licensed
that means that other people can come and they can do other things with it if they think that they
can do a better job um and so on then they can go ahead and do that so i i think those two things have
to be fundamentally contradictory i do think it's really sad that the some of the best intentioned
projects in humanity have been what have have powered the career like the the
advance of these technologies that um we're now seeing um be used to try and extract um and i'm
talking about wikipedia i'm talking about the fact that that the um the alt text that people put on their
images so that people with um with uh vision impairments could understand what they were missing
from the image that's what's used to to to train um mid-journey and like the diffusion models um and
like things like the the broader project of of the the eu with the the translations as well like the
fact that we have such high quality human done translations between these different languages has also been
used um some of this is i think being put to uses that to really subvert the intention um behind it
and that i think is really sad um as for what wikipedia's response should be what i would really
love to hear is a response from somebody in the room who is from wikimedia because i don't want to
speak for them are there any thoughts about that maybe maybe that's something we can all discuss over
the drinks and food yes later we should i'll just check if these two have any answers to that
question and then we'll go into i like to add a little bit i don't i can't answer your question
totally but it's um um i made the experience that it's really problematic that the licensing in wikipedia
is uh cc by or cc by sa and just this because uh first i um released my movie on the cc by and csa so
it was clearly non-commercial and it doesn't stop teachers to use it or you know we have also open
educational resources and stuff like this so um it was it's really fine for the for for everybody but
then i wanted to have to to do this experiment to put it on wikimedia um wiki comments because
it's the only platform without a commercial interest so i took away the nc and then it started that
other filmmakers once wanted to use parts of my movie commercially and without paying for it and
um big funded more money into their movies than in my one and so i had to stop them and i asked wikimedia
once if they have an upload filter for cc by sa so um that you know that you can find a balance between
the commercial and you know giving it away for society and um not um giving uh something out there
for making more money for other people so i will steer clear of the minefield that is discussions around
licenses on uh wikipedia wiki comments but i think your question is obviously interesting because
i mean digital platforms come with network effects and and such and so obviously they will gravitate
towards attracting the most successful ones will gravitate towards attracting all of the users and
then the other ones become kind of useless at the same time i think what we observe for for the wiki
model is that there's tons of little wikis online on a variety of nerdy topics right if you're a harry
potter fan there will be a harry potter wiki or a lord of the rings or whatever science fiction uh wiki
for your um subject and and i think that's great right there's a proliferation of this model
and also i think in terms of yes okay there's this this paradox of um it it well it it furthers ai
development and if that's something that you intended and you know if that's something you wanted
to do is unclear of course right but um i think there's also something to learn from the wiki model
which is that people will come together to create as humans and use sources and i think that's you
know sometimes not so clear for ai models where it's very intransparent um you know in terms of what
are those models learning from um you know that that's really a lack of transparency obviously and and
i think so basically i would say um you know as wikimedia you can be quite proud of the model you
can show that at least this part is working quite well uh is is model to replicate and uh yeah i mean
you know that that kind of stands in contrast to ai of course i mean there's still this paradox and
that it also you know is is used to to teach the model but um yeah that that's hard to resolve i think
maybe over drinks yeah i think that's a great uh a great place to end because there's so much more
to talk about i'm sure we've all got many more questions for rebecca and justus and sandra all
right thank you all so much for joining us tonight uh we will i think we have drinks and food outside just
here thanks
