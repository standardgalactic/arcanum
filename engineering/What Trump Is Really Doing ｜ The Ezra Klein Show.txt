In 2017, when Trump came into the White House for the first time,
on day one, he signed exactly one executive order.
It was targeting the Affordable Care Act.
In 2025, he signed 26 executive orders on day one.
One withdraws the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord,
eliminating birthright citizenship,
setting January 6th writers free,
declared an energy emergency,
and recognizing just two sexes, male and female.
Now, one of the difficulties of covering Donald Trump
is it's always hard to know where to look first,
or even to look at all.
Back in the day, I used to do a policy podcast at Vox.
Hello, welcome to another episode of The Weeds
on the Vox Media Podcast Network.
I'm Matthew Iglesias, here today with Ezra Klein,
Dara Lynn, The Weeds.
Matthew Iglesias is now the author
of the excellent Substack newsletter, Slow Boring.
I mean, I think that it's...
And Dara Lynn is now a senior fellow
at the American Immigration Council.
I thought it'd be good to have a bit of a reunion
with two of the people who follow the policies
that the Trump is working on most closely
to get into the guts of what is actually changing
and what, as of yet, really isn't.
As always, my email,
Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
Dara Lynn, Matt Iglesias, welcome to the show.
Good to be here.
Good to be on.
It's like old times.
Yeah.
So let's dive into immigration first.
Donald Trump signed about 10 executive orders
on border security and immigration.
When you look at them together, Dara, what do you see?
What we see here is a body of orders
that are pushing the federal government
to take a much, much, much, much, much more aggressive approach
on immigration enforcement,
especially in the interior of the United States,
especially integrating the military into border enforcement
in a way we haven't seen,
but without really prescribing a whole lot
in terms of specifics,
because they understand that that's going to have to happen
at the agency level.
That's going to have to, you know,
that requires the actual machinery of the federal government
to work itself out.
A lot of Biden-era enforcement priorities got rescinded.
It is currently, and this is actually as of Tuesday night,
the U.S. has the legal authority
to deport people without a court hearing
if they're arrested anywhere in the U.S.
and cannot prove to an ICE agent's satisfaction
that they've been in the U.S. for at least two years,
which is something we're going to have to see
how that plays out on the ground.
And there is a push toward building more capacity
for detention, which is going to be very important
if they're going to scale up enforcement efforts.
A push toward punishing other countries
that refuse to accept deportation flights
by putting visa sanctions on them,
which is going to be extremely important
if you're going to succeed in deporting people.
So, like, on the interior side,
there is a very big shift toward
both the kind of expanded legal authority
and the expanded capacity,
which you can't do immediately,
but which they're building toward.
When you read this, Matt,
does it look to you like mass deportation,
which was promised and feared,
or does it look to you like what they're trying to do
is create a climate of fear
and, as Mitt Romney once put it, self-deportation?
I mean, it's...
What's actually happening is closer to the latter, right?
I mean, in terms of the question of, like,
what is the quantity of people who are deported,
the historic peak for the United States
came during Barack Obama,
and the main reason for that,
at least as I understand it,
is that there was really strong cooperation
between ICE and state and local law enforcement officials,
and basically they were picking people up out of jails
all throughout the country,
which is a very efficient process.
If you're thinking of deportation
as a resource-intensive kind of operation,
people who are already in custody
are the easiest people to deport,
and then numbers started to come down
because of policy changes in blue states,
then different enforcement priorities,
things like that.
But what Trump at least would like,
what real immigration hawks would like to see happen
is create, like, harsh day-to-day living conditions
for people who are in the country without authorization.
Very optimistically, they hope people will self-deport.
Beyond that, they just think it's a deterrent, right?
Like, people come to the United States without visas
because they believe that life as an illegal immigrant
in the United States of America
will be better than their life back at home.
So if you can make it worse in any number of different ways,
including by just raising uncertainty
that a person kind of working off the books
and minding their own business might get deported,
you know, that has a kind of an impact.
If you do, like, yesterday, I think Tom Honan was on TV
and he was like, we arrested 308 people already,
which was, like, I think the average under Biden
was about 310 ice arrests per day, right?
So there's a certain amount of, like,
we're getting tough theater that is occurring
and that will occur.
But we don't really know what's going to happen, right?
I mean, we haven't ever seen really tough interior enforcement
in the United States, both because of the logistics,
but also because the politics are tough
the more concrete you get, right?
I mean, you can get right now,
there's big immigration backlash.
And so, like, should we deport everyone?
Polls, like, pretty well.
You, you know, go into a restaurant that you like
and ICE has, like, deported the guys washing the dishes
and now the restaurant's closed
and one of them is married
and he's got, you know, kids who are American citizens
and there's, like, a sad story in the newspaper.
That's where you get into more difficult things
and it's why Trump always talks about criminals
because he's always talking about criminals,
criminals, criminals, criminals,
which is, like, I think an easy sell, right?
Somebody who, in addition to immigrating illegally,
has committed non-immigration crimes.
But the impetus behind these orders
is to try to say nobody is safe, right?
Like, everybody better watch their back.
So, as far as self-deportation,
the immigration hawk theory of self-deportation
has never really been about fear of deportation
will lead people to self-deport.
It's the inability to work
is going to lead people to self-deport.
And as far as that is concerned,
there's a provision in these executive orders
that says that the agencies shall ensure
that no unauthorized immigrant has a work permit.
Now, that's actually not current regulation.
Current regulation is if you have a pending application
for asylum, for a green card, et cetera,
and it's been pending for a certain amount of time,
you can apply for a work permit
and work in the U.S. legally.
If they're going to change those regulations,
that takes people who are currently working legally,
puts them into the illegal labor pool,
and, you know, potentially removes
what would be an impetus for them to stay.
So, that's definitely something to watch for.
And there's this noise about, you know,
restricting all federal funding
from any sanctuary jurisdiction,
which was followed up with a memo sent
by the Department of Justice to attorneys
saying that they should investigate
state and local officials
who refuse to cooperate with the Trump administration.
So, the question of whether places
that would be resistant
are going to be bullied into cooperating
and places that are enthusiastic
are going to have the full support
of the federal government behind them,
if you do both of those things,
then you really ramp up the ability
to do this more frictionless handover.
Do they, Dara, have a legislative agenda here?
And one of the ways in which I mean that
is you make the point that the self-departation theory
is that you can't work here
and it's miserable to be here.
But the theory of the long-time theory
of how to make it hard to work here
wasn't deportations.
It was things like E-Verify.
It was things like holding employers accountable
for hiring undocumented or unauthorized immigrants.
I have not heard them
or Republicans talking that much about it,
but I've been wondering if that's coming
or they just don't want to work with Congress
so they're not going to try.
The extent to which E-Verify,
and I was noticing this
even under the first Trump term,
like that it had just fallen out
of the top tier of the wish list.
You used to hear about it all the time,
under Obama, under Bush.
Like this was the theory.
What happened to it?
I mean, I think it's because
the kind of the traditional immigration hawks,
the Center for Immigration Studies folks
who had put together the intellectual framework
of attrition through enforcement,
which is what got called self-deportation,
aren't the people who are running the show.
They're a different flavor of immigration hawks
who are much more concerned about cultural threat.
And so the, you know, putting together,
the intellectual apparatus of what exactly,
what are the buttons we push
to get people to leave on their own
isn't necessarily what they're thinking.
They're, you know,
the Stephen Miller approach is
what are all of the other parts of the U.S. code
that we haven't been looking at
that can be used?
You know, there's a provision in here
that cites a little-used provision of U.S. law
that says aliens have to register
and says, okay,
so the federal government's going to publicize
that people have to register.
And then we have to do as much as possible
to criminally enforce failure to register.
Now, people who entered the U.S. without papers
have not had an opportunity to register,
you know, in many cases.
And so there's a certain bit of paradox
for, like, punishing people
for failing to do something
you never let them do.
But it's that sort of thing.
It's identifying unused tools
much more than, you know,
the big question for Congress is,
I think, is really a budgetary one
is how much money
are they going to throw at enforcement?
Because, you know, as Matt pointed out,
like, we've never done anything
close to the scale
of what they are threatening to want to do.
And the more that Tom Homan and company
want to spend on, you know,
getting headlines by sending
a bunch of ICE agents into California,
the less money there is in theory
for stuff like, you know,
building soft-sided detention facilities
and other unsexy things
that you're going to need to do
to get your capacity.
But Matt, you seem,
or they seem to have
a much clearer pathway
to working with Congress
than they would have in the first term.
You mentioned how one reason
you had high levels of deportations
and Obama was very strong cooperation
between the federal government
and the states.
Under Trump, after Obama,
you had this huge blue state backlash
to immigration enforcement
and you had sanctuary cities
and so on.
I mean, we're in New York City right now.
I think Eric Adams would love
nothing more than to cooperate
with the Trump administration.
But even among Democrats in Congress,
even among the kinds
of Democrats in Congress
who were resistance Democrats
in 2017, 2018,
you saw the move to working
with Lankford on the Murphy-Cinema-Lankford bill
that then Kamala Harris ran on.
That was a big shift right for Democrats.
And now you've seen a bunch of Democrats
sign on to the Laken-Riley bill,
which is a very sharp shift right for Democrats.
So it seems to me
that if the Trump administration
wanted to kick off
a policy process with Congress
that is trying to toughen enforcement
on the employer side,
it's a very different political alignment
than it was in 2018.
I think, yes, clearly.
Like, the politics have shifted
in blue America.
I think particularly around
removals of people
who've been arrested.
And that to the extent
that Donald Trump wants to,
like, work with people
and get back to an Obama-type
policy agenda there,
like, I think he could get it done
through a mix of political fear
and sincere change of heart
on the part of Democratic officials.
Like, the Riley Act deals
with a basically related set
of considerations.
I mean, the headline,
the thing Republicans would put
in an ad against you
if you voted no on it
is that this bill requires ICE
to detain people,
you know, who've been convicted of theft
and some other list of crimes.
Arrested for?
Arrested, yes.
So the, you know,
objections to it
relate to sort of due process.
I mean, people can be arrested
for things they have not committed.
But also, it creates a lot of,
like, state causes of action
where you can sue
the federal government
for having not done X, Y, or Z.
It was pretty clearly written,
like, when Joe Biden was president,
like, to get Democrats
to vote no, right?
By saying, like,
this is unworkable,
it's going to hamstring
the executive
and then Republicans
could run against it.
Democrats started saying,
well, we'll vote to advance this,
but, like, we're going to,
we're going to, like,
fix that stuff
in the amendment process.
Then because Republicans really,
like, they wanted to get to no
on that bill,
so they wouldn't do
any of the amendments.
And then Democrats
refused to take the no vote
that Republicans wanted them to take.
So now this, like,
probably unworkable bill
has passed.
E-verify
and employer sanctions
are a different kettle of fish
because when Republicans
were putting together,
I think they called it H.R.1.
It was, like,
this big immigration package.
H.R.2?
H.R.2, yes,
when Biden was president.
And initially,
mandatory E-verify
was in that package
because the point of the package
was to be maximally hawkish.
Again, they wanted to get to no
with Biden
so they could complain.
But, like,
that's a, you know,
a sticky point for Republicans
and it raises the question
of where does Trump
want to go with this ultimately
in terms of workplace raids,
other things that are
bothersome to the business community
versus just kind of picking fights
with progressive mayors
and governors
about local law enforcement cooperation.
Dara,
the piece of this
that people, I think,
have heard the most about
is the executive order
on birthright citizenship.
How did you read that?
Just laying out what it does.
The birthright citizenship order
declares that
it is the position
of the U.S. government
that anyone born
after February 19th
of this year
whose mother
is either someone
who does not have legal status
in the United States
or who has
some form of,
you know,
temporary visa
or other temporary protection
in the United States
and whose father
is not a U.S. citizen
or green card holder
is not a citizen
of the United States by birth.
Most of the text
of the executive order
is a defense
of a very novel legal theory
that is not only
is the 14th Amendment
of the Constitution
not as it has been interpreted
by, you know,
the Supreme Court
for over a century
et cetera
but that we can change
that interpretation
via executive action
and simply declare it
by fiat.
You could think
of the birthright citizenship
debate as having
two components.
One, which I think
everybody was expecting
them to go after,
was children born to people
who are not here legally.
And then there's this
other question
that they added into it
which is people
who are here legally,
they're here on a student visa,
they're here on an H-1B visa,
some people have called
this a Kamala Harris provision.
I know many people
who were born
in the United States
this way
and this has not been
nearly as contested
but they added that in too.
Mm-hmm.
Matt, how did you understand that?
I think that part of it,
you saw this back
when during the
they're eating the dogs,
eating the cats
controversy
which is that
the sort of
MAGA movement
has tried to
redefine
people with things
like temporary
protected status
or people with
asylum applications
you know,
in the process
as illegal immigrants.
Right?
When in a
I don't know
like in a
in a legal sense
it is not illegal
to arrive
without a visa
and then benefit
from a grant
of TPS
et cetera,
et cetera,
et cetera.
You know,
I think
Vice President Vance
who's more
cogent
than President Trump
has, you know,
explained that like
in his view
this is like
a loophole.
This is like
lawyer BS.
Right?
And so I think
part of the intention
of this expansive order
is just to
to sweep
all those people
in.
The fact that
it also applies
to people with
totally normal
uncontroversial
visas like
Trump was out
saying that
he loves the
H-1B visa program
that he employs
lots of people
with H-1B visas.
He clearly doesn't
and I think
he's referring
to a different
H-2B.
There's never
been a question
that like
you are allowed
to come to
the United States
on a J-1 visa.
You're allowed
to come on
a student visa.
And then, yeah,
like people
get into
relationships,
particularly people
with employment
based visas
are often here
for many, many
years before
they get a green
card.
And there's
never been
a political
controversy about
that that I'm
familiar with.
And it's
it's quite
I mean,
they really
don't like
immigrants,
at least some
of the people
behind this
policy in a
more extreme
way than
the president's
official position.
And I think
they are
they are
signifying that
and it
you know,
people should
rightly
read into
that something
I think a
little bit
menacing
about the
ultimate
intention.
Are they
just creating
a piece of
this?
It could be
lopped off
in the courts
or even
just in
public debate
where the
extreme
position
is that
you
don't want
to have
birthright
citizenship
for people
here on
student visas
and H&B
visas.
But the
position
then you're
left with,
which is
the one
they really
care about,
is you
get rid
of it
for the
children
of
unauthorized
immigrants.
So I
don't think
so.
And, you
know, the
reason I
don't think
so is
because, yes,
we've never
had a big
political
controversy
around people
on student
visas having
children.
But there
has been
political
controversy
around people
on temporary
visas having
kids in
the United
States.
You know,
when Trump
was running
for president
the first
time in
like 2015,
2016,
there were
a couple
of news
cycles about
birth tourism
and, you
know, the
practice of
getting a
tourist visa,
spending that,
you know,
often spending
that time at
like a
designated
resort for
this purpose,
having a
child during
the time
you're on
the 90-day
tourist visa,
and then
that child,
who is not
necessarily
raised in
the United
States,
but is
raised in,
you know,
whatever their
parents' home
country is,
has the
benefit of
U.S.
citizenship
at some
later point
should they
choose to
act on
it.
And that
is, you
know, that
was a very
big target
of the
kind of
Bannon
wing of
the MAGA
movement,
which is
very concerned
about the
lack of
assimilability
of, in
particular,
Asian highly
educated
immigrants who
are, you
know, taking
jobs that
could otherwise
go to
disadvantaged
Americans.
And so I
think that
it's not
obvious to
me that
if you
bisect that
and say,
well, we
really only
care about
children of
unauthorized
immigrants,
that that
really does
satisfy
everyone
because the
question of
birth tourism
has been
tied up in
the question
of birthright
citizenship
as the
Trump, you
know, as
like Trump
world has
understood it
over the
last decade.
Doesn't the
existence of
birth tourism
suggest there
is something
indefensibly
broad in
the way
that the
citizenship
has been
interpreted?
I am
as pro-immigrant
as you, I
think, can
possibly be,
and I
think that's
abusive of
the rules.
It is
surprising to
me that
this has
continued to
exist because
when you
seek, you
know, there
is like an
entire regime
in place that
is designed to
prevent people
from being
issued visas
that are going
to abuse the
terms of those
visas, right?
And so I
am surprised
that there
hasn't been
more of a
crackdown on,
you know,
excluding countries
from the visa
waiver program if
they have a
history of birth
tourism, more
aggressive, you
know, interviews
at consulates
about like,
gee, I
noticed that
this 90-day
window, it
seems like
pretty definite.
You're really
staying for the
whole 90 days.
Can you talk
more about what
you're doing
during that time
and like more,
you know, because
there's so much
discretion to the
State Department
in denying
visas, like in
theory you could
have an
enforcement-based
approach to that
that doesn't
change the law.
So that's, you
know, I think what
we're identifying as
a policy
problem.
So I like, I
see where you
are.
I just think that
it's reasonable to
talk about like a
solution on the
scale of the
problem.
I take that
point, but
obviously they
don't want a
narrow solution
to the most
egregious of the
policy problems.
What they want is a
big debate about
what it means to
be a citizen.
And Matt, I've
been thinking about
our long career
in journalism.
And you both
probably remember
covering immigration
immigration in
the, I
don't know, I
call this like
the 2005 to
2015 period.
And back
then it was
much more
common to
talk about
illegal immigrants.
And then you
get a lot of
email from
people in the
immigration advocacy
community and
also just people
and say, listen,
that's a really
dehumanizing way to
talk about this.
Can we say, you
know, it's better to
say undocumented
immigrant,
unauthorized
immigrant, sort of
eventually made its
way to yard signs,
right?
no human being
is illegal.
You can talk
about illegal
immigration, but
not illegal
immigrants.
And behind this
linguistic change, I
think really did
come a change in the
Democratic Party's
affect towards
illegal immigration.
That illegal
immigration, unauthorized
immigrants, moved from
a really big policy
problem to solve, then
during the Trump
administration
particularly, to a
disadvantaged class
to protect.
And this feels to
me like the
argument that the
Trump administration
is at a very core
level across both
some of the
enforcement and
some of the
birthright moves
engaging, which
is how should we
feel about these
people who are
here illegally?
Are they people we
should view as
sympathy and try to
protect?
Or are they an
invasion, a horde,
or at the very
least criminals who
have abused our
system and need to
be treated the way
we treat other
criminals, which is
with punitive
measures?
I think that Trump
has basically won
this argument, you
know, that he has
gotten, I shouldn't
actually say Trump
because in a lot of
ways Greg Abbott was
more like the key
figure here, but like
got Democrats to
admit that like they
in fact think it is
undesirable to have
sort of unlimited
quantities of people
arriving in their
jurisdictions in an
irregular manner.
You know, and that's
you see that in the
Lincoln-Riley vote
count, you see it in
the Murphy-Langford
bill, you see it in
the executive orders
that Joe Biden
issued, and you
know, to an extent I
think that was always
reflected in some of
Biden administration
policy, but it only
very much at the end
became like what they
would say they were
trying to do.
The interesting
question for Trump,
I mean, and I think
people who win
elections face this
divide all the time,
is like, do you want
to make the most
durable policy change
that you can, or do
you want to kind of
have fights about
things?
Because I think
clearly if the
president of the
United States really,
really, really wants
to shine a spotlight
on birth tourism and
say like we need a
bipartisan legislative
solution to create
some kind of
denaturalization process
for egregious abuses
of this, whatever it
is, I think it's
like tough for like
swing state Democrats
for anybody, for me,
for you, for anybody
to say like, no,
birth tourism is
amazing, like we want
to encourage this,
right?
The more things you
stack onto the pile,
the easier it is for
everybody to say no,
right?
That like we're going
to basic 14th Amendment
principles, we're talking
about people on
completely normal work
visas have all sort of
been lumped into this.
It's really easy for
Democrats to reject
this order the way
it's been written
because it's so, so,
so broad.
But that also means
that Republicans can
have a fight about
the order, right?
They can pick the
strong cases.
Democrats can pick
the weak cases.
Nothing will get done.
I think they'll just
lose in court.
I mean, the
constitutional argument
they're going with
here is risible,
in my opinion.
But this is the
first time I think
in our long
association together
I've heard you
suggest that the
fact that a
constitutional argument
is risible will mean
it will lose in court.
It's just...
I am pretty cynical
about this, but you've
always been more
cynical than me.
This is just a topic
that has been litigated
like a lot over the
years.
And I've never...
I mean, I mean...
The individual mandate
and the Medicaid
expansion in Obamacare.
I know, but like,
but like, I mean,
Darrell will correct me
if I'm wrong, but I
mean, I think like,
just like very
literally this question
of what does it mean
to be subject to the
laws thereof
has been litigated.
This is not like a new
version of an old
question.
They want to arrest
illegal immigrants,
right?
That's like a big point
of emphasis here,
which is to say they
are subject to the
jurisdiction of the
American government.
There's no argument
that illegal immigrants
have diplomatic immunity
or something like that
or that, you know,
they're sovereign
tribal nations.
Well, is it the argument
that they're an invasion,
right, Dara?
That's what they're
trying to play?
Well, the invasion
thing is, I think,
a separate but fascinating
argument they're trying
to make.
If you were to say
what they think
in this court
they have helped build,
you know,
when Stephen Lohr
goes to bed at night
and is optimistic
about the mourning,
what Supreme Court
opinion he's hoping
gets issued?
I mean,
it's very hard
to tell from the outside
the difference between
we genuinely think
that this question
has never been
properly tried
because when
Wong Kim Ark
was decided
over a century ago
we didn't have
illegal immigration
in the same way.
The circumstances
of Wong Kim Ark
stem from the
Chinese Exclusion Act
which was like
three immigration regimes
ago and so
now that we have
a population
of millions of people
who have no legal
status in the United States
you can make the argument
that they're not subject
to the jurisdiction
of the United States
in a way you couldn't
before and how much
of it is,
but we have the Supreme
Court now
so they can change that.
Like, I genuinely
don't know if we can
tease those two apart
and I don't know
how much it matters
to do so, right?
Ultimately,
the arbiters
on how much
Calvin Ball
were playing
with constitutional law
are the people
in robes
and I agree with Matt
that they would have
to be playing
a whole lot
of Calvin Ball
in order to side
with the administration
on this.
I think the other
question here
when we're talking
about the kind
of broad politics
of how do we talk
about unauthorized immigrants
is that we have
a wave of new arrivals
of people primarily
entering through
the asylum system
over the last decade,
the, you know,
the growing population
of people
with temporary protections
such as TPS,
such as these Biden
parole programs
who are also
more recent arrivals
and you still have
the unauthorized immigrants
that you had
10 years ago
who have been here
10 years longer
and who for the most part
still haven't had
any point of access
into the immigration system
and so as we've talked
for the last 10 years
about immigration
as being a border
asylum issue,
you know,
and I think Matt
was actually really,
Matt was calling this out
years ago,
that that like created
political problems
for Democrats
because it took a population
that had been here
for a long time
and made them feel
like they were being
shunted aside
in favor of more
recent arrivals
but it also means
that they're now
in danger of getting
lumped in as like invaders
and I think that
the invasion,
like the legal aspects
of the invasion argument
are really hard
because they're primarily
military and I'm not
an expert in that
but I do think
that it is very important
for the birthright point
that it is
it's building
the rhetorical case
that they aren't
subject to our jurisdiction
they are trying
to come for us.
So I want to move
to the economy.
When Donald Trump
was running for president
one of his
very strongest arguments
was that everything
got in very expensive
under Joe Biden.
He has himself said
that the price of groceries
was a very big part
of why he won the election.
When you look at
what Trump said
in his inauguration speech
when you look
at the executive orders
when you look at
what they've at least
said they are doing
what agenda emerges
for you
on the cost of living?
Well, they are clearly
hoping that increased
domestic energy production
will have benefits
for cost of living.
I mean, that's
that's the part
that you can connect
the dots on.
I mean, I think
experts have some
skepticism about that.
On the groceries,
you know, there's really
not not a lot going
on here.
In the orders,
there's just like literally
nothing.
I could have suggested
some things for them
if they wanted to.
So like the Biden
administration,
for example,
like raised like wage
floor standards
for agricultural
guest worker visas.
It was like the only
restrictionist thing
that they really did.
And you could you could
put that back down,
make things make things
cheaper.
Well, let's hold on
the energy piece
because he did do
a lot on energy.
And it's not crazy
to say that increased
energy production
would be good
for American growth
and bring down prices.
I think people forget
this, but it took him
months to leave
the Paris Climate Accords
in his first term.
I mean, they moved
much more slowly
in their theory
of what to do
on climate
and energy back then.
Elon Musk was very
angry about it.
Elon Musk was very
angry about it.
Yes, Elon Musk
had some very
different views back then.
The theory now
is you can increase
domestic production.
Domestic production
of fossil fuels,
which is what
they're targeting,
is currently at record
levels.
It has never been higher
in American history.
How much headroom
do they have here?
You know,
this is a tough one, right?
I mean, I think
if you talk to people
in the oil and gas industry,
the thing that they
were really mad
at the Biden administration
about was pausing
the construction of new
liquefied natural gas terminals.
The Trump administration
has done what the industry
wanted there.
I think he's correct
to, frankly,
and this will increase
American natural gas production,
but the reason it will
increase American natural
gas production
is we will be able
to export more gas,
which, as the Biden people
like to point out,
will raise the price
of domestic electricity,
not lower it.
The thing that the oil
and gas industry wants
is more demand
for their products.
That's what these LNG export
terminals are going to create,
and that's what sort of
the federal government
foaming the runway
for permitting
of big data center projects
is going to ensure
that there's a lot of demand
for natural gas.
But is it going to make it
cheaper for you at home?
Like, probably,
it might make it more expensive.
It's just ambiguous
in terms of its basic upshot.
Similarly, you know,
he's going to rescind
some of these electric car
type regulations
that Biden issued,
but I think people
will continue to buy
more electric cars
than they did
in the past,
one way or another.
Again, Elon Musk
continues to be out there
making his Teslas.
So the long-term outlook
for oil production...
Although, you can't stop
on that for just one second.
Please.
For a very long time,
I felt,
well, look,
I don't personally love
Elon Musk's
sharp right-work swing
and all the conspiracy theories.
But it's going to get
more people
buying electric cars.
Yeah, if Elon Musk
can depolarize
electric vehicles
and make it something
not just that liberals
in San Francisco
want to do,
but actually a status symbol
for Texans too,
and maybe get Donald Trump
on board with it
as a sort of symbol
of like American ingenuity
and dominance
of one of the obvious
industries of the future.
And it's not like
Trump is outlying
electric vehicles,
but Elon Musk
becoming the central
consigliere
to the Trump administration
and his central,
in theory,
industrialist concern
is the rapid adoption
of electric vehicles.
And Trump's main policy
on electric vehicles
is to roll back
the regulations
that were accelerating
their adoption
is a...
I mean, I guess
you give Elon Musk
points for being
principled on things
that are not just
his business interests,
but it's a little bit
disappointing
as what the trade
ended up being.
It's odd.
Can I step back
a little bit?
Because like,
I think that
one of the things
that really strikes me
going into this
Trump administration
as opposed to
the first one
is the first time around
it was very clear
that Donald Trump
was a politician
without a constituency.
He had not been
made by anybody.
And so he...
There was nobody
who was going to
haul him into a room
and say,
we brought you here.
If you don't listen to us,
we will end you.
And that made it
much harder
to predict
what he would do.
It made it much...
It made like
the kind of
White House intrigue stories
of who he was listening
to much more important
because you couldn't use
that standard
political calculus.
This time around,
he's coming in
with what looks
much more like
a traditional
political coalition
with various people
feeling they have
claims on him,
which includes both
in this case,
the Musk and company
industrialist policy,
crony capitalist.
It is very important
for the government
to affirmatively subsidize
the things that we want
and the Russ vote
and company
massive deregulatory.
There's absolutely nothing
the federal government
should be doing
to support electric vehicles.
And it's weird
for Trump,
but it's very normal
for politics.
And it's going
to be interesting
to see how this
very traditional
interfactional divide
plays out
when the person
making the decisions
is still Donald Trump,
a man who pretty famously
doesn't really
hold on to anything
consistently enough
to make it
very predictable
which way he's going to fall.
I think that's right
as a political science theory,
but actually
maybe wrong
about the factions.
My understanding
of Musk right now
is like you can imagine
Musk in his Tesla guys,
not his international
right-wing provocateur
and funder
and attention getter guys
as having
like plausibly
two theories, right?
There's always the argument
all he cares about
is saving the world
from climate change
and getting to Mars.
There's this other theory
that what he wants
is for Tesla to be
like the biggest company
in the world
because that is where
the bulk of his wealth is
and his power is.
And getting the subsidies
for electric vehicles
pulled back
at the time
that Ford
and General Motors
and these other players
are accelerating
into electric vehicles
and maybe getting
to a point
where they could challenge
Tesla for making good cars.
Well, Tesla's
a really big advantage.
They've been doing this
for a long time.
They're way ahead
of everybody else.
Their marketing is way better.
People know them.
And so my sense of Musk
at least in part
is that he's really
let's call it chilled out
on the climate change question.
Much less worried about that
than he once was
although he still says
he is worried about it.
And, you know,
he got his
like the support
for electric vehicles
is what made Tesla
into the company
it is today.
But Tesla is fine now.
And if there's no support
for electric vehicles
then it is the other players
probably the legacy players
trying to climb
the electric vehicle ladder
who are about to find
the ladder falls down
under them
before they attain
you know
the sort of level
of quality and production
that Tesla did
again under years
and years and years
of federal
and state support.
I mean I think
that's right.
What will be interesting
when we see
how democratic states
sort of react to this
because Tesla's profits
have been accounted for
by basically credits
tax credits
right this is not
as important
to their business
as it used to be
but it continues
to be a big
kind of moneymaker
for them
because California
has increasingly
strict emissions rules
and then a number
of other blue states
kind of piggyback
on them.
Gavin Newsom
seems to be trying
to see like
can he reconfigure
that as like
a subsidy
for non-Tesla
electric cars
and I think there's
legal questions
and implementation
questions around that.
Big picture though
like I think
the thrust
of Trump's energy
policies
will increase
America's gross
domestic product
by causing us
to care less
about climate change
and certain other
kinds of things.
Whether they will
reduce prices
to American consumers
I think is much
more questionable
right.
Democrats
were going nuts
all throughout 2024.
They were like
why are people
mad about inflation?
Inflation's down
to 2.4
you know
year over year
and then just like
well we didn't like
forget
that there was
9% inflation
18 months ago
and that it was
5% inflation
9 months ago
and so like now
and the prices
did not go down
you couldn't forget
because things
were still more expensive
but you get used
to price levels.
And also we were
I don't want to say
we remember
it was Joe Biden's fault
but the people
who think it was
Joe Biden's fault
remember that they
think it was
Joe Biden's fault.
So like
I don't know
that it's actually
now a lot of
conservative
take-slingers
will be hypocritical
when they pivot
back around
to being like
you can't actually
make the price level
fall
but like it's true
you can't actually
make the price level
fall
and I just don't
you know
it's a shame
for Joe Biden
that we had
9% inflation
when he was president
but like
people were mad
about that
and I don't know
that there's going
to be so much
juice in like
lol
prices didn't get
cheaper
that being said
I mean
when I was
a guest
on your show
previously
we talked
about this
a lot
but like
Trump's
tariff agenda
his fiscal
policy
all of that
points toward
a re-acceleration
of inflation
and that's
you know
perilous
even if it
doesn't get
up to 9
although that's
something we
we saw
Dara
which is that
he did not
come in on
day one
and impose
a bunch
of new tariffs
I was wondering
where the tariffs
were
we're studying
the creation
of an external
revenue agency
which definitely
sounds to me
like the kind
of thing
you do
when you
don't want
to put into
play
your big
tariff proposal
right
we're creating
a blue ribbon
commission
but then
but then
he did say
there's going
to be tariffs
on Mexico
and Canada
starting in February
one of the
questions on
tariffs has
always been
does Donald
Trump
really really
really want
to find a way
to get to
yes on tariffs
or does Donald
Trump love
the ability
to come into
a negotiating room
and say
if you don't
give us
everything we want
will tariff
the hell
out of you
like this
is you know
the arguably
the signature
policy win
of Trump's
first term
on immigration
was getting
Mexico to agree
to accept
large numbers
of people
you know
across the border
who were waiting
for asylum hearings
in the United States
which he accomplished
by threatening
Mexico with really
punitive tariffs
for months
and months
and months
so like
I think
that this
is all
consistent with
we're using
tariffs as a
big stick
and now that
Marco Rubio
is actually
secretary of state
he gets to
play good cop
and go in
and tell
Claudia Scheinbaum
here is the way
that you can
avoid these
tariffs
that the
president
really wants
to put on
you
but I have
your back
but I'm
actually not
sure
like
it's
there also
really does
seem to be
a belief
among
Donald Trump
himself
and at least
some of the
at least a professed
belief among
some conservative
intellectuals
that tariffs
are affirmatively
good for America
so if he
ends up saying
oh we've suspended
all tariffs
because Canada
you know
because we're
taking the win
with Canada
and Mexico
and China
does that
leave a
constituency
unsatisfied
I think
you know
I think
some
foreign leaders
have to
ask themselves
if they
want to
call the
bluff
here
you know
because
you're
right
Dara
right
I mean
Trump
in his
first
term
pretty
effectively
wielded
the threat
of tariffs
as a kind
of negotiating
strategy
then during
the last
six months
of the
presidential
campaign
Trump's
business
community
supporters
were like
everywhere
in the
business
press
and amongst
themselves
telling people
like don't
worry
don't listen
to what
Janet Yellen
and Kamala
Harris
and you
know
Ezra Klein
are saying
about this
like the
president
is just
using this
as a
negotiating
tactic
you know
Trump
during the
lame duck
he just
tweeted
or truth
social
that there's
going to be
25%
tariffs on
Canada
and Mexico
and then
Trudeau
put out
some
announcement
that was
like we're
going to get
really tough
on fentanyl
and then
Trump
took yes
for an
answer
and was
like oh
the tariffs
are off
but now
he says
they're going
to be
back on
and I
hesitate
these people
they've got
to listen
to their own
advisors
they've got
to think
about
what's
what
but you
know
we all
you don't want
to be a sucker
in every
negotiation
right
like at a
certain point
somebody has
to be willing
to say
Mr. Trump
it appears
to me
from your
behavior
that you
in fact
know
that these
tariffs
are a bad
idea
and are
doing
a ploy
and I
can like
read to you
the passage
from the
art of the
deal
where you talk
about how
you like to
bullshit a lot
in negotiations
and make
dumb threats
and like
if you
do this
it will
be bad
for my
country
it'll be
bad
for your
country
the exchange
rates will
also adjust
it's going
to be
political
blowback
on you
though
not me
because people
know
this is
your
stunt
and like
just like
you know
leave us
alone
it's
it's
risky
but
the fact
that they
weren't
in the
day one
right
I mean
it
it does
call
into
question
right
that like
maybe
these business
guys
were
correct
I mean
that's
the question
I think
I'm really
asking
here
were the
business
guys
correct
he doesn't
want to
do this
he's
not
going
to
do
this
I've
thought
it's
been
interesting
that
that Bob
Lighthizer
who was
Trump's
trade
representative
in the
first
term
and is
widely
considered
probably
the most
effective
single
member
of the
Trump
administration
in the
first
term
is
not
anywhere
there
right
there
was
you
you heard
him
talked
about
for
treasury
secretary
you heard
him
talked
about
for
but he's
in
Florida
somewhere
at the
moment
right
there's
a
New Yorker
piece
on him
you know
it's not
that the
people
who are
there
are not
pro
tariff
they've
many of
them
the head
of the
council
of
economic
advisors
has written
you know
positively
on
tariffs
Scott
Besant
the treasury
secretary
has talked
about
tariffs
but
Besant
has talked
about
tariffs
as a
negotiating
tactic
and
Stephen
Mirren
wrote
an
article
for
I
think
he
just
like
did
it
for
his
hedge
fund
or
something
and
it's
like
what
the
article
quote
unquote
says
is
that
like
the
liberals
are
wrong
and
tariffs
are
really
good
but
then
the
analysis
is
that
tariffs
actually
won't
raise
prices
because
exchange
rates
will
adjust
and
that
means
that
you
want
to
so
that
financial
markets
have
time
to
adjust
to
the
tariffs
and
it
all
just
seems
like
a
way
to
say
that
you're
for
tariffs
while
actually
acknowledging
that
they're
bad
one
view
I
guess
is
that
Trump
was
like
tricked
by
these
guys
I
don't
know
I
kind
of
feel
like
I
I've
been
looking
at
all
the
obsequious
flattery
that
different
CEOs
have
been
throwing
Trump's
way
and
I'm
patsy
as
everybody
is
saying
and
it's
like
everyone
knows
the
way
to
Trump's
heart
is
with
like
completely
disingenuous
flattery
or
does he
just
enjoy
this
right
like
as
a
thing
he
thinks
it's
funny
that
he
can
make
the
monkeys
dance
by
putting
it
out
there
that
like
if
you
say
nice
things
about
Trump
he'll
like
you
I
would
go
further
than
this
I
think
you're
missing
an
option
on
that
so
one
of
the
things
going
on
right
now
is
this
announcement
of
Stargate
a
consortium
of
companies
working
on
AI
who
want
to
put
in
huge
amounts
of
money
into
energy
and
AI
data
center
infrastructure
and
Stargate
was
going
on
and
getting
ready
and
people
are
working
on
this
before
Donald
Trump
became
president
then
he
became
president
and
now
they're
like
thank
you
Donald
Trump
we
couldn't
do
it
without
you
which
in
some
technical
sense
is
probably
true
it's
useful
to
have
the
help
of
the
president
but
it's
not
a
Trump
initiative
but
then
Elon
Musk
who
hates
Sam
Altman
and
is
suing
OpenAI
for
turning
himself
into
a
for
profit
or
trying
to
turn
itself
into
a
for
profit
he
tweeted
something
mean
at
Sam
Altman
I
don't
remember
exactly
what
and
then
he
and
Altman
got
into
a
spat
Musk
said
they
don't
actually
have
the
money
and
then
Altman
came
back
and
was
like
you
know
I
hope
that
in
your
new
role
you
mostly
make
decisions
that
are
good
for
America
so
that
was
interesting
and
then
the
next
day
Sam
Altman
comes
out
and
says
I
really
realize
that
I
completely
misjudged
Donald
Trump
in
the
first
term
I
was
thinking
like
and
that
Trump
is
going
to
be
so
great
for
America
and
I
really
turned
around
on
this
whole
thing
and
I'm
sorry
for
underestimating
him
before
but
I
am
all
in
I'm
paraphrasing
him
that's
functionally
what
he
says
maybe
that's
how
he
feels
maybe
it's
half
how
he
feels
but
certainly
looks
like
he's
now
trying
to
outmaneuver
Musk
right
Trump
was
excited
about
Stargate
Musk
is
Altman
tweet
where
Altman
had been
praising
Reid Hoffman
for
how much
he spent
on
defeating
Trump
and saying
that liberals
don't know
how much
they should
appreciate
Reid Hoffman
The point
I want to
make on
all this
because it's
amazing to
talk about
I guess
and depressing
but is it
something
I think
there's another
option between
Trump is
a patsy
who will
believe any
level of
flattery
no matter
how
disingenuous
and
Trump is
a cynic
who just
enjoys
the flattery
which is
that
Trump
understands
speech
as a form
of action
and commitment
and that
whether you
believe it
or not
when you
go out
and you
say
I am
pro-Trump
and he
is a
genius
you have
either
subtly
or aggressively
shifted
who you
are in
public
if you're
Sam Altman
or someone
like that
in ways
that then
change
how you
have to
act
and who
your
allies
are
and
you know
in the same
way that
making Sean
Spicer
say that
the inauguration
crowds for
the biggest
ever
was a way
of you know
arguably
I mean you see
this a lot
in authoritarian
countries
enforcing that
loyalty test
makes it
people who
have taken
it more
loyal because
there are
other options
who become
worse
right
Sam Altman
is probably
held in
worse
repute
in the
Democratic
Party
today
and to
be fair
Democrats
were already
annoying him
by sending
him letters
about why
he was donating
so much
to the
inauguration
fund
but if
you move
Sam Altman
out of the
Democratic
Party
because you
get him
to say
very nice
things about
Trump and
that makes
Democrats
mad at him
and then
he gets
mad at
the Democrats
then you
actually have
increased his
loyalty
whatever the
real content
of the
flattery
was because
to speak
that way
is to take
an action
it's to
reorient
your alliances
and then
your incentives
change and
they change
in a pro
Trump way
I'm not
saying Trump
is a
mastermind
lots of
strongman
leaders
have come
to this
theory
independently
it's just
a way
human beings
work I
mean it's
the way
corporations
work you
make people
go out
and whether
or not
they really
agree
with the
new
corporate
policy
if they
have to
say
they
agree
with it
then they
sort of
have to
act
more like
they
agree
with it
but that's
what I
read is
happening
here
so we
need a
Michael Bennett
Sam Altman
beer summit
where they can
talk about their
letter sending
no I mean
that all makes
sense
I think it's
like a year
ago
I was really
maybe even
six months
I was really
on like
no like
Trump
is a
tariff
fanatic
like that's
why he keeps
talking about
this
that's why
he's having
so much
problems
with these
things
but there
are now
there are
now doubts
significant doubts
in my mind
based on the
team that he's
assembled
because he
has to
your point
gotten them
to sort of
say that
they're for
tariffs
but they
kept enough
caveats
in that
analysis
right like
they didn't
act if you
look at
Besson
statements
Marin
statements
the things
that they've
put on paper
they did
not like
burn their
bridges
with
conventional
neoclassical
economic
analysis
which is
different from
there was
this
Wilbur Ross
paper
where they
were like
net imports
are subtracted
from the
GDP
calculus
so therefore
if we
balance trade
GDP will
go up
and that's
totally wrong
that's like
really bad
economics
and everybody
wrote that
it was like
these guys
are numbskulls
and so that
was this kind
of bridge
burning movement
right where
if you're
willing to
make a
statement like
that you
are not
going to
be like
welcomed
back
in the
polite
society
of people
who
understand
international
trade
whereas like
this
mirin
thing
where it's
like
well it might
generate some
revenue
and the
equilibrium
price effects
are not
actually that
large
that's like
I think
not what
most people
think
but it's
reasonable
all of this
is unpredictable
my wife and I
are thinking
about buying a
new car
we were asking
ourselves like
do we need
to rush out
and get it
before the
tariffs come in
and we're like
I don't know
it's like
exchange rate
might adjust
like we don't
know what's
going to happen
there could be
retaliation that
actually makes
things cheaper
the world is
complicated
and like on
that level of
tariff defense
that they've come
up with
is respectable
enough
that it just
kind of makes me
think like maybe
this is just
just for show
and you know
I'll leave my
words when
imported fertilizer
all is a 20% tax
and nobody can buy
bananas
but
like the question
of predictability
is what like
I cannot get my
head around
though
because like
in economics
as it's understood
like and I didn't
think this was
particularly controversial
like the important
the fundamental
insight of law
and economics
is that firms
require predictability
from the government
in order to make
internal decisions
not knowing
whether there are
going to be tariffs
on your products
or whether you're
going to have to
you know devote
a tremendous amount
of you know
attention capital
to flattering
the president
and having your CEO
do that instead
of a lot
of other things
your CEO
could be doing
like you can
imagine that
being a problem
it does seem
to me that
like at a certain
level there
should that
like the inability
to know whether
there are going
to be these
massive tariffs
has to have
some kind
of knock-on
economic effect
right
but only if you
buy that
it only has
a unpredictability
effect
if the business
community actually
acts like it's
unpredictable
but I think
they've all
persuaded themselves
perhaps correctly
that it's not
unpredictable
that you might
have specific
tariffs
and we've already
been having tariff
back and forth
with China
for some time
including under
Biden
so I think
there's an
expectation
that you're
going to have
tariffs on China
those might go up
that's probably
somewhat priced in
but you know
the business world
is not acting
like we're going
to have 20%
tariffs or 10%
tariffs on
everything
if it happens
then yeah
that's going
to be a hit
but in part
because they're
not preparing it
that's actually
a hedge against
it happening
in a strange
way
like the worst
hit
you can persuade
Donald Trump
it will be
to the stock
market
the less likely
he is to do it
like you can
really imagine
a day
where there's
a big
Wall Street
Journal story
and it says
on Monday
the tariffs
are happening
yeah it's happening
it's on
and then it's
going to be a crash
and then there's
a three and a half
you know
there's a
some significant
drop in the
in the Dow
and then all
of a sudden
they're not
happening on
Monday
right
that's a thing
I'm a little bit
think is going
on here
by acting like
it's not
happening
you probably
make it a little
bit less likely
that it happens
one of the other
dogs that is barking
a little bit more
quietly than it was
maybe a month ago
in between
Donald Trump winning
and Donald Trump
taking office
we heard a lot
about Doge
the Department
of Governmental
Efficiency
sure I did
co-run by Vivek
Ramaswamy
and Elon Musk
and they're all
over X
and having big
debates about
H-1B visas
and you know
what spending
to cut
and there was
a big Wall Street
Journal op-ed
they did
where they said
that they were
going to advise
Doge at every
step to pursue
three major
kinds of reform
regulatory
rescissions
administrative
reductions
and cost savings
Musk talked
to Times
about cutting
as much
as $2 trillion
from the federal
government
that said
you know
maybe you don't
get quite there
be cut
a trillion
dollars
now we see
the EO
on Doge
Ramaswamy
is out
and the
executive orders
mandate is
quote
modernizing
federal technology
and software
to maximize
governmental
efficiency
and productivity
what happened
there
it's a little
bit hard
to say
I mean
so literally
right
it was the
Obama administration
created the
United States
digital service
yes
back when
exciting
Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs
were mostly
Democrats
with this idea
that you could
improve the
efficiency of
government
by having
like elite
tech strike
team
I know people
who've worked
there
Doge is now
going to be
the new name
of the
USDS
which will be
the United
States Doge
service
so that they
can reuse
the logo
which I guess
is efficient
and it is
now
zeroed in
on changing
IT
procurement
which seems
like a good
idea
from everything
that I've heard
about federal
IT procurement
it is an area
that is ripe
for reform
and some
increased
efficiency
I mean
when all these
Doge opeds
were flying
around
I think
if you
looked at
you know
the more
sober minded
people in
conservative
think tank
land
they were
all saying
like guys
like this
isn't going to
work
that's not
how the
government
works
like you
can't
you can't
just come
to the
agency
and say
ah there
aren't
regulations
anymore
because
I mean
I don't know
what to say
like it's
the government
we have
laws
we have
courts
we have
the
administrative
procedure
act
it is
true
that the
government
is not
run as
efficiently
as a
well run
startup
because
unlike
at a
well run
startup
you can't
just
decide
something
isn't
working
and shut
it down
you can't
just lay
somebody off
because you
think they're
super
like all
of that
is accurate
but it's
like it's
genuinely
true
it's not
like you
have to
change it
through
legislation
right
and it's
just it's
not like
it never
occurred to
anybody
that it
might be
more fun
for the
president of
the united
states to
just be
able to
make stuff
up or
tell people
what they
should do
you have
to implement
the laws
that exist
yeah and
I also have
questions about
who exactly
it is who
did that
realizing
right
like it
is clear
that whoever
on the
transition team
was responsible
for drafting
executive orders
related to
doge
had that
realization
has
Elon Musk
come to that
conclusion
that he can't
just waltz
into you know
the bureau of
alcohol tobacco
and firearms
and say 50%
of you are
fired and the
other 50%
have to show
me 20 pages
of code
one of the
things that
as we sort
of come to
a close
here I
have been
trying to
read the
leaves on
is what is
Donald Trump's
relationship
with Congress
and legislation
about to be
compared to
every other
presidency I've
ever seen
come in
this one has
come in
with nobody
really talking
about big
bills they
want to pass
and on
everything we
have spoken
about from
energy to
the economy
to immigration
to IT
procurement
in the
federal
workforce
right
and who
you can
fire
and who
you
can't
all of
that
could be
much more
ambitiously
reshaped
through legislation
we know
in the
background
that Mike
Johnson
with his
extremely
narrow
majority
is working
on a
tax bill
I think
everybody
expects
a bill
updating
and expanding
Trump's
tax cuts
and extending
them to
at least be
proposed
at some
point
but
they seem
just really
intent
on what
they can
do
individually
I'm curious
how
Dara and
then Matt
you all
are reading
what seems
like a very
executive
focused
presidency
but in
being
executive
focused
is
giving up
on a
certain
amount
of ambition
that you
can only
have
if you
are going
to really
work on
a legislative
agenda
I think
that
everyone
is very
comfortable
with the
equilibrium
we've seen
over the
last like
10 years
or so
of
instead of
policy
originating
in congress
with legislation
policy
originates
in the
executive
branch
then via
litigation
it gets
punted to
the judicial
branch
to issue
a thumbs
up or
thumbs
down
on
and half
of congress
is responsible
for turning
the judge
machine
on and
off
like
that is
the
equilibrium
we have
congress
has not
been
super
interested
in
legislating
under
presidents
of
either
party
and so
it is
not that
surprising
to me
that
an
administration
that is
very
focused
on
areas
where
there
is
a lot
of
executive
leeway
in terms
of
trade
negotiations
and
immigration
enforcement
has
the
general
attitude
that
they're
going
to
see
how
far
they
can
get
with
the
executive
branch
and
know
that
congress
isn't
going
to
stand
up
for
its
prerogative
as
the
legislative
branch
and
try
to
stop
them
from
doing
things
that
might
have
been
seen
as
quasi
legislative
action
in the
past
and
well
so
just
one
thing
I
want
to
flag
to
me
is
like
it's
small
but
it
really
signifies
what
you're
talking
about
which
is
that
the
congressional
tax
writers
told
the
transition
do
not
issue
an
executive
order
rescinding
Joe
Biden's
electric
vehicle
regulations
we want
to put
that
into
the
tax
bill
because
since
there
are
tax
credits
for
people
who
buy
EVs
if
you
rescind
it
in
a
bill
that
scores
as
saving
money
and
you
can
use
that
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
tax
cuts
and
then
like
there
were
stories
that
like
it's
all
squared
away
like
they're
not
going
to
do
this
executive
order
it's
going
to
be
part
of
the
pay
for
it
was
in
the
menu
of
spending
reductions
and
then
Trump
just
did
it
right
like
it
was
not
just
that
he's
taking
action
on
his
own
rather
than
waiting
for
Congress
or
engaging
with
Congress
he
did
something
that
congressional
Republicans
like
specifically
asked
him
not
to
do
because
they
were
going
to
do
it
right
I mean
it
wasn't
a
disagreement
and
it
would
make
it
easier
for
them
to
do
other
things
he
wants
them
to
do
supposedly
and
I
think
you
know
I
think
the
paradox
of
changing
American
public
policy
as the
typical
high level
politician
is
it's
been
very
like
politically
potent
of him
to just
kind
of
like
cut
off
the
anti-abortion
movement
at the
legs
once it
became
politically
inconvenient
for him
he's a
very
dominating
presence
in
Republican
politics
Joe Biden
spent
like a
lot of
time
worrying
about
blowback
from
the
left
over
various
things
and
showing
that he
was
delivering
but
like
with
Trump
you
know
the
presence
the
persona
the
lib
owning
the
announcements
kind
of
are
delivering
for his
core
supporters
and
I don't
think
he
stays
up
at
night
worrying
if
they
wind
up
needing
to
settle
for
a
temporary
extension
rather
than
a
permanent
TCJA
like
I'm
really
going
to
be
in
for
it
you
know
but
like
it's
actually
a
really
big
deal
like
there's
a
reason
like
earnest
congressional
Republicans
would
strongly
prefer
to
find
enough
offsets
to
make
this
permanent
because
if you
make
it
permanent
that
makes life
a lot
more difficult
for the
next
Democratic
president
if it's
temporary
and a Democrat
wins in
2028
or 2032
that's
that's like
way better
for the
cause of
progressive
politics
it's
it's
it's
not
like
Trump
won't
sign
the
permanent
version
or
that
he
opposes
this
kind
of
thing
but
like
he's
clearly
not
that
invested
in this
question
of
permanent
policy
change
and again
I mean
I was
saying this
about
immigration
stuff
like
I
think
he's
he's
made
so
much
headway
politically
with
this
that
like
he
could
get
stuff
done
in
a
bipartisan
way
that
overcomes
the
filibuster
that
is
hard
to
reverse
but
it
doesn't
that
doesn't
seem
that
important
to
him
versus
the
position
taking
the
sense
of
action
but
he
genuinely
appears
to be
a
much
more
forceful
presence
who
dominates
the
scene
and
like
he's
really
into
that
and
I
just
don't
I
don't
know
that
he
cares
about
the
permanence
that
comes
with
legislation
I
think
that
is
a
good
place
to
end
always
our
final
question
this
is
like
the
most
good
government
normie
take
to have
on this
particular
week
but
I
think
that
like
the
fifth
risk
by
Michael
Lewis
is
probably
a
good
book
to
revisit
if
you
have
it
and
to
skim
if
you
haven't
read it
checked
it
out
yet
just
for
a
reminder
of
the
innumerable
things
that
the
federal
government
does
that
a
broad
based
attack
on
the
civil
service
is
going
to
end
up
degrading
in
some
form
or
another
Demon
Copperhead
was the
only
novel
I
read
twice
last
year
and
I
think
that
it
is
the
rebuttal
to
all
of
the
pseudo
sentimental
hillbilly
elegy
debate
in terms
of
what
really
happened
to
the
rural
poor
over
the
last
25
years
and
if
I
don't
say
an
immigration
book
I'm
probably
going
to
be
fired
so
Everyone
Who
Was
Gone
is
here
by
Jonathan
Blitzer
specifically
the
first
half
which
talks
about
the
80s
and
has
really
great
archival
material
as
a
reminder
that
like
government
is
made
of
people
and
people
make
decisions
Tim
Schenck's
book
Left
Adrift
is
a
great
sort
of
intervention
into
the
what's
up
with
Democrats
kind
of
debate
looking
historically
at
Bill
Clinton
and
to
an
extent
Barack
Obama
but
also
a
lot
of
Tony
Blair
Ehud
has
a
book
that
is
I
think
not
quite
out
yet
but
I
read
in
galleys
and
that
is
going
to
be
released
in
a
couple
weeks
I
just
read
it
as
well
it's
called
Why
Nothing
Works
it's
not
it
covers
similar
themes
to
your
book
but
more
detail
on
a
narrower
set
of
topics
and
you'll
really
learn
a
lot
about
the
history
of
big
infrastructure
projects
I've
also
been
trying
to
reclaim
my
kind
of
scrambled
cognition
in
the
new
era
so
I'm
reading
old
long
novels
Middlemarch
is
by
many
people's
estimate
the
greatest
English
language
novel
ever
written
I
read
on
the
internet
so
I
read
it
it's
really
good
you
know
it's
the
conventional
wisdom
they
just
like
they
really
nailed
that
one
it's
by
George
Elliot
you
can
get
it
for
like
20
cents
on
an
ebook
version
public
domain
is
lovely
you'll
learn
something
and
you'll
you'll
learn
how to
read
long
sentences
which
is
miraculous
in this
day and
age
