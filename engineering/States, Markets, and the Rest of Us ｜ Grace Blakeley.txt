we used to have mass democracies where politicians were concerned about protests in the streets,
about workers who could shut down the economy, literally. So there was a much more even balance
there because politicians had to consider the needs of workers just as they had to consider
the needs of businesses. That was the foundation of social democracy. It was the fact that you had
this relatively even balance between workers and bosses and politicians in the middle trying to
mediate between these two groups. That's what we lost is a sense of the collective power of ordinary people.
Hello and welcome to Planet Critical, the podcast for a world in crisis. My name is Rachel Donald.
I'm a climate corruption journalist and your host. Every week I interview experts who are battling to
save our planet. My guests are scientists, politicians, academics, journalists and activists.
They explain the complexities of the energy, economic, political and cultural crises we face today,
revealing what's really going on and what they think needs to be done. These are the stories of the big
picture. Go to planetcritical.com to learn more and subscribe. My guest this week is Grace Blakely.
Grace is a political economist. She's a staff writer at Tribune and the author of several books,
including her most recent Vulture Capitalism, Corporate Crimes, Backdoor Bailouts and the
Death of Freedom. She's also recently launched a new project, the What Can We Do newsletter. This
project aims to remind us that collective action is not only possible, but it is already happening
all the time. And this is what Grace joins me to discuss. The imbalance of power between states,
markets, markets and the rest of us, which is deteriorating the everyday economy, our well-being,
our lives, our relationships and what to do about it. Grace explains on this episode that the so-called
divide between the markets and the state is nonsense. That the states and markets have always worked in
tandem to buttress one another. And that after the labor movement was dismantled during the Thatcher
and Regan era, the necessary checks and balances from everyday people were obliterated, unleashing
a system which was always designed for the rich to get richer. We also discussed the fact that we live
in a world of two economies. The ethereal, abstracted economy that politicians and economists discuss,
and the everyday economy that we all exist in all the time. With Grace revealing why it is that
politicians capitulate to that other economy, and why despite growth going up and the economy
allegedly being strong, everybody's lives are getting worse. Finally, we discuss individualism
versus collectivism. The fact that the ruling class are incredibly collective, while the rest of us
are forced to fight over scraps. With Grace explaining that the only way to seize power back
is to do so together. I hope you all enjoy the episode. If you do, please share it far and wide.

on Planet Critical. It's such a pleasure to have you on the show. Thanks so much for having me. It's
great to be here. My first question for you is why is the world in crisis? So my answer to the question
why the world is in crisis centers on the fact that we live in a capitalist world economy. And what does that mean?
It basically means that we live in societies that are divided between a group of people who own
everything and who make the decisions about how those resources are used and then a much larger
group of people who are forced to basically work for a living. And if they're unable to do that then
they're kind of consigned to conditions of destitution basically. Now it's really important to understand
capitalism as this system that is a class divided system because there are a lot of people who will tell you
capitalism is a system that's you know based around free markets and often free markets and democracy
right. And if you understand capitalism in that sense then it's hard to pinpoint why it would have
led us to a point of such significant crisis you know because you could say well the problem today is
that we have big monopolistic corporations that control vast you know swathes of resources and
they exploit those resources for profit and do so at the expense of people and planet but that's not
capitalism because they don't exist in a free market because those are monopolies. Or you could say
you know the problem is that actually governments continuously intervene to prop up big businesses
or you know financial institutions. And that's not capitalism either because the government is
intervening in the free market. And this is the kind of you know the idea that the system that we
live in now is not real capitalism. It's some form of kind of you know perverted
um capitalism that that doesn't kind of ring true to the roots of what that system was supposed to
look like. And actually what I argue in my most recent book vulture capitalism is that it is
functioning exactly as it was supposed to because when you understand how this system really works
and you see that actually it has nothing to do with free markets it's never had anything to do with
free markets all the way back to the origins of capitalism with the East India Company that was a
collaboration between merchants and the British state to set up a big monopoly that could run
the British Empire. Capitalism has always been a system based on collusion between you know politicians
and big businesses has always been a system where corporations have attempted to expand their control
over markets. The thing that has defined that system throughout the entire course of its existence
has always been the fact that there's been this small number of people who control all the resources
make all the decisions and use their power and influence to basically dominate and control
everyone else. And what's been different over the course of those several hundred years has been
whether or not everyone else has been capable of resisting the exercise of that power or whether
they've been so scattered and divided that the elites have been able to basically do whatever they
want and we're in one of those periods now. Is there a period in very recent history in which people were
successful in resisting the enclosure of their lives and livelihoods?
Yeah so I think when you look at the history of capitalism you have to look at it as
shifts in the balance of class power basically. So it's never the case that the power of those at
the top the power of capital is total but it's also never the case that workers and you know communities
have complete control over what's going on. But today we live in a world in which the scales are tipped
like very very sharply in favour of big businesses and you know the powerful states that support their
interests. If you go back in history you know kind of 60-70 years say in the rich world to the post-war
consensus to the period where you had a much stronger labour movement you had stronger kind of social
movements you just had groups of collectives that were capable of resisting the power of big business
resisting the power of the states very effectively. Those were times when our societies were more equal
you know they weren't perfect the global economy was still very unequal although again the balance of
power between rich countries and poor countries was less significantly tilted in one direction
rather than another. But you know if you look at for example the UK or the US you had strong labour unions
you had a strong peace movement environmental movements and at the end of the 60s and 70s
they all started working together really quite effectively and resisting you know arbitrary authority
from the state resisting the power of big business to for example force workers to pay for inflation
in the form of lower wages. And that was when we got the neoliberal revolution which is not a coincidence.
It was designed precisely to push back against that organised power and reassert the dominance of those
at the top. You know this was a project that Thatcher and Reagan free markets that was kind of cloaked in the
language of freedom. It was about privatisation and shrinking the state and creating greater space for free markets.
But that was all really a kind of cloak behind which hid the real mission which was just reasserting
the authority of those at the top of society of the big businesses and the politicians that were working
alongside them. And that kind of that kind of culture of hierarchy and domination I would argue is actually central
to the way that capitalism works even though its advocates claim that it's this nice decentralized free market system.
It's interesting to think about how there's been a capture of facts. I think I think I'm going to call it a capture of facts.
How this collusion between market and state is totally embedded into capitalism and it's
kind of sort of built out from you know the old feudal times in which there were men that were kings and
they had all the resources and yet it was their armies that were going out and extracting those resources
in order to sort of power the kingdoms. And it's so interesting to kind of live in a time now where that
very evident relationship which is evidenced by subsidies or by the very fact that governments
need a fuel source in order to run and typically certainly in the western world that is provided by
private companies that they have managed to kind of both put it on one another and thus obfuscate the
very nature of their relationship. And that's why you can have men like Trump sort of saying like oh
it's you know it's the fault of the big state as a businessman it's the fault of the big state and we need
to reduce it or even governments like our own in the UK sort of saying oh it's the fault of fossil
fuel companies not the fault that we actually haven't invested in any kind of other meaningful
infrastructure since the warnings that you know were first raised in the 60s and 70s. So how is it
that we can go about sort of revealing that relationship more and also what is it that we can actually do
about it given they are so kind of enmeshed now it really does feel impossible to kind of
reform one without toppling the other which could lead further down the line to really
quite dramatic consequences just for everybody else. Yeah look I mean ideology is a very very powerful thing
um and you know the ideas that we we kind of hold on to often subconsciously in which we use to process any
new information um that they're kind of incredibly powerful uh filters through which we see the world
right and the the filter that a lot of people have is one that has been really kind of strengthened and um
and disseminated by basically the right and it's this view that the world is divided into governments on the
one hand and then markets on the other hand um and you know the government is a kind of inefficient
um authoritarian uh unaccountable system and markets are these you kind of nice decentralized spaces
in which kind of free market interactions can take place and that is a kind of a framework that
was spread by the right but it's also something that was tacitly accepted by the left um and if you
think just about the kind of history of ideas you know we had in the kind of um late 1800s
the you know when capitalism was kind of when industrial capitalism was really starting to become
embedded we did have this idea pushed by very early free market economists that there was this natural
market mechanism and the government should step away and allow markets to kind of take their course
it was after um the wall street crash in the 1920s when you had the rise of keynes and keynesianism
who came in and said actually no markets don't function very effectively when you leave them on
their own you need governments to step in and tame them and that ideology became hegemonic it became very
powerful after the second world war and in fact during the second world war when governments basically
realized that they needed to step up and build a war economy and then after that um they kind of
created social democratic states with support from the labor movement and they used keynes's ideas
which was which were also based on this perceived separation between markets and states to then build
a left-wing model right and then you had the 1980s when that was flipped on its head again
and people came in and said well actually the state's gotten too big and too powerful so we need to tame it
and create more space for the market again for over 100 years we've had this tacit acceptance by all of
our politicians all big political thinkers that there is this separation and it's just not true if you go
back to before that period to when for example marx was writing he said things like you know the capitalist
state is nothing but a committee for managing the affairs of the bourgeoisie i.e the capitalist state
does largely what big business wants it to do and this is marx who's often you know uh by people who
don't really understand characterized as a thinker who advocated for a big state doing lots of things
on everyone else's behalf it just shows how much the um you know political ideology has been influenced by
this very very pervasive and wrong idea that you can separate markets and states and you can have a
nice independent government that you know acts very rationally to make sure that the market operates in
in an effective way or you can have markets that exist separate from states and which you know largely
kind of um function according to their own logic it's just not true what happens in markets is determined
by politics and politics is determined by what happens in markets because you know if you have
policy makers who are trying to make decisions about the future of a society you're going to have
big businesses and lobbyists who are working to influence their decision making and then of course
those politicians will make laws will make regulations create you know tax um law all of this sort
of stuff that then affects what goes on in the economy so changing that system it requires more
than just this endless back and forth we've had for such a long time between more market more government
it actually requires a shift in the balance of power within society you know i have this argument in
vulture capitalism which is the problem is not an imbalance between the private sector and the public
sector it's not that politicians have too much power or even corporate executives have much too much
power because the power that big business derives comes in large part from its relationship with the
state the imbalance is an imbalance of power between elites and everyone else you know bosses have too
much power over workers governments have too much power over citizens rich countries have too much power over
poor ones um and all of these forms of domination kind of pervade the society in which we live and the idea
that we could shift from one side to the other and just say right you know we'll get a state that's
a bit bigger so it can manage the market or reduce the state to give more space for big business it's
just for the birds and i think that is becoming obvious now this ideological veil that we've had for
over a century is starting to lift because you just see so clearly when elon musk and donald trump
are working together to manage the us state and manage the us economy it's like okay well you can't
really argue that those two things are separate anymore um and that's actually a very interesting
moment because the legitimacy of the system that we have now rests on the idea that there is an
independent government and that there is a free market and when people start to realize oh we don't
have an independent government and we don't have free markets then that's going to really you know
create quite a lot of problems it's going to mean that people no longer by default accept that this
system is is right though that as we're seeing potentially benefits the far right which says
let's burn the whole thing down and kind of put this charismatic leader at the head of our new
system just as much as it would ever benefit the left there's uh a very interesting kind of
a hall of mirrors effect i feel like sort of existing today existing today and attempting to
be politically and economically aware and you speak to it as well like the tautology of you know
government and markets kind of both being the origin and the end of either and to me a part of this
seems to be like we've forgotten the the very first level of inputs so for all of the talk of economics for
example you don't really read economists anymore or you know commentators anymore talking about what
that what actually is the backbone of the economy you know marx wrote that it was labor or you have
some post keynesian economists are talking about the input of natural resources but it does seem to be
all kind of uh or in the mainstream economics and politics are sort of talked about as if divorced
from the real world as if divorced from people's lived experiences and as if divorced from
the actual kind of uh laws of the universe that make the world go around um and one of those
things is gdp even though gdp was decoupled from you know the the increase of uh well-being or living
standards you know after the 2008 financial crash we still have it's so goddamn boring you know it doesn't
matter if it's one of the tory finance ministers or if it's rachel reeves it's still growth growth growth
growth growth despite the fact that there being no actual tangible evidence for that being a meaningful
goal anymore um and i think it's therefore understandable that the public who are living
incredibly precarious and unstable lives take very little interest or notice of what is going on
politically because there's that sense of it not meaning anything anymore there's that sense of not
just economics not trickling down but economic theory not trickling down and so it's a bit of a
wild card question but what other language plays are happening with markets and government economics and
political theory that are have sort of gone beyond you know the chicken and the egg reality that we're
living in and just kind of into this world of of um oh i don't know just a totally linguistic territory
that is actually you know become meaningless it's such a good point um this the kind of divorce between
people's lived experience about the economy and then the way particularly that politicians talk about the
economy but also you know policy makers in general is so so significant because we've had
largely since the financial crisis let's say um we've had politicians and policy makers
saying you know the economy is growing sometimes it hasn't been growing particularly quickly but it's
been growing we've had politicians saying employment is the highest it's ever been we had record levels
of employment as in the number of people who are in the labor force right we had extremely low inflation
for a very long period of time and we had booming financial markets and so politicians would cite all
of this evidence for the fact that you know the economy was doing really well and people obviously
naturally tacitly assume when the economy is doing well then that must be good for me that must mean
that my life is going to get better in some way you saw a similar sort of thing in the us right um
and there was a bunch of evidence actually recently about the most recent election
um the republicans and democrats were really split on their views of how the economy was doing like
you know whether or not the economy was growing um and basically like republicans uh were more likely to
say that the economy was performing badly and democrats were more likely to say it was performing well
right and this is because it's not because you know those two groups had wildly differing experiences
of the economy because you know that they're um relatively evenly spread out across a lot of
different socioeconomic groups and and their perceptions of the economy were just so extremely
divergent it's because the economy has become this kind of floating signifier of like how do you feel
how do you feel about the future what do you think is going to happen and it's a very kind
of future-oriented thing as well it's like do you think things are gonna get better for you for
example and it is no surprise that that's happened because yeah we've had this very long period of
time of employment's great inflation is low you know we things are growing it's it's gonna get
better in the future and everyone's lives either stagnating or getting worse right unless you're in the top
10 maybe right because living standards have barely budged particularly over the last five years
but even before then we had the longest period in the uk of wage stagnation since like the 1850s
wages just flatlined even as asset prices rose so how are you going to afford a house when your
wages are stagnant house prices are rising we had you know increases in poverty um there was you know
there's lots of debate about whether or not inequality has in fact increased but when you account for tax
avoidance and evasion then yes it has unsurprisingly hmrc statistics say that it hasn't but that's
because surprise surprise the rich aren't reporting their taxes correctly and we just had this like rot
in our society and social fabric which was the everything stopped working public services stopped
working um it became so much harder to get a doctor's appointment um even like things like our public
spaces deteriorated people started to see money like much more homelessness um we started to see
kind of the the deterioration of of nature our waterways obviously became much more polluted similar
sorts of processes happening in the us although the change was much starker in the uk with the shift
towards austerity um and then the cost of living crisis hit the pandemic of course first and then the cost of
living crisis and that made things turn once again for the worst where not only had wages stagnated now
for over a decade but now if you accounted for inflation we saw these huge declines in living
standards and purchasing power um which you know that have just started to recover let's say last year
or the year before maybe in the us um and which now are tailing off again because growth is slowing
inflation is rising again all of these kind of deep rooted problems by the way the economy is
organizing are rearing their ugly heads and in the uk there's a statistic from the national institute of
economic and social research the living standards at the bottom 40 percent aren't going to return to
2022 levels until 2028 and they weren't high in 2022 right in the us you've had um income stagnating
over the last few years and that's you know probably going to continue the us may even enter recession
given the fact that you know this is another subject but the ai bubble is going to pop at some
point and there'll be a stock market crash and then trump's massively increasing joblessness by
trying to lay off a bunch of federal workers so there's just this divorce between our what we hear
about the economy largely from politicians and then the vast majority of people's experience
of the economy that means that it loses reality as a phrase it ceases to become grounded in anything
real and yet it still retains this massive importance in our political discourse and people attach
a load of different stuff to what you know growth is and it creates really really unhealthy dynamics
because you can just say growth growth growth growth growth if i cut taxes it's going to boost growth
i've got an economist over here he'll back it up for me and everyone says great well growth is probably
good so let's vote for this person who's going to cut taxes for the rich to boost growth and then it
doesn't work and then someone even further to the right says oh well yeah but that didn't work
because actually there's too many migrants and they're the ones that are making you poor so because
this is completely divorced from people's actual sense of of living standards because we don't have any
politicians talking about living standards about how they're going to make working people's lives
better our whole discussion around the economy has just become completely divorced from reality
i'm always amazed at how boring living through probably one of the the the worst crisis since the
last mass extinction is um because it's just the same said going you just circle the toilet train whether
it's you know uh climate solutions on mainstream television from politicians that center around
net zero as if the planet can fall for accounting tricks um whether it's you know politicians on both
sides of the aisle just bleating on about growth as if that actually means anything it's like it's like
the neoliberalism has kind of climaxed in this capacity to actually take meaningfulness away also from
language like it took meaningfulness away from our relationships and from our work and from our sense
of purpose and now it's come from the very thing the tool that we use to make sense of the world
of the world in this kind of uh you know last hurrah you to the rest of us
and so i'd like to kind of go back to you know what is an economy how do we tether it to real people
and how can people get this sense that hey you get to make one too that we're all existing in economies
all of the time aren't we yeah there are there are lots of different ways to understand the economy
and i would argue that in reality there's probably two economies right there is the economy in which we
live we work we play we buy right it's grounded much more in our communities it's grounded often in
in place in the place we live and work it's you know going to the shops and buying something it's
jumping on a train to go to work it's going to your place of work all these things are
you know embedded in a kind of reality that makes it easy for them easy for you to kind of see what's
going on you know if the price of milk goes up you know if you know you can't get to work because the
traffic's too bad or you know the trains don't work anymore you know how many hours you have to spend at
work and all of these things feed into these metrics around the economy and you know how much
you earn all of these things have a very real impact on your life and then there's the kind
of economy is like an abstraction which is you know the measurement of wages in total the measurement
of profits in total um and that then feeds into the prices of these things called assets right which
are these kind of legal constructions based on an underlying physical thing like a share for
example is an asset that is a claim on the profits of a company and those shares are traded in financial
markets where investors make bets about the likely future profits of that company now those two things
are linked right if you have a you know sudden crash let's say in investors expectations about the
future suddenly everyone starts thinking the economy's going to do badly in the future so they
reduce investment that reduced investment means corporations have you know less cash their share
prices collapse they think all right things are going to get worse i'm going to lay off workers
then that starts to affect you in your real life in the real economy right um you you know might
lose your job you might have to work a lot harder you have to get a new job whatever the same thing with
inflation that's something that can start anywhere it can start in you know the imaginations of
uh a group of people let's say if they decide i'm going to like in for example the 1970s the oil
producing countries created um this cartel opec and they decided we're going to make oil prices
higher for lots of different reasons that boosted prices throughout the whole of the economy and
created inflation um it might be that countries go to war and that makes makes resources much more scarce
it might be that something very real happens in the real economy like for example an extreme weather
event or a blockade or you know something physical that prevents the movement of goods these two
things are very are closely interlinked but in some ways they've become more and more separate as
time has gone on and we've learned to focus much more on the kind of ethereal fantasy economy
that we have on the everyday economy we kind of don't really care about the everyday economy anymore
no one bothers asking really no one particularly cares in a position of decision making oh you know how
are people's wages doing what's poverty like what's inequality like are people happy you know
what about things like community cohesion that's a really critical factor in determining actually
levels of productivity in an economy like do people feel rooted in their places do they feel
valued do they feel connected all these things are really really important but economists don't care
about stuff like that they care about corporate profits they care about share prices they care about
what everyone else in financial markets think is going to happen tomorrow they don't actually
care what's going to happen tomorrow they care what everyone else thinks is going to happen tomorrow
because that determines whether or not everyone else buys a share and then if everyone else
buys share the price goes up so we you know we are so hyper focused on this you know this economy that is
divorced from what is going on in the everyday and it has i would argue led to a lot of really bad
policy decisions it's the foundations of trumpism right trump's whole appeal is him saying i am going
to come into power and i am going to boost financial markets that's what he did last time he delivered a
huge round of tax cuts for corporations corporations were like great we have loads more money we're going to
give that all out to our shareholders and because we think the economy is the stock market and if the
economy gets better then i'm richer everyone thought great stock market going up even if you as an
individual don't have any shares which most people don't sure you might have a 401k you might have a
pension fund investment but like that's not a direct benefit to you right now that trump has basically
created this short termist model of tax cuts that mean you know corporations are dishing out profits to
to their investors so that that kind of brain rot the like the economy is the stock market
like lie is so central to the way that these decisions are made um and it is really really
problematic i actually remember not that long ago um rachel reeves back in the day when i were when i
worked at a think tank she asked me to write for this um pamphlet that she was creating as part of
the fabian society on the everyday economy she was like the everyday economy is so important um we need
to focus on things like social infrastructure who is providing care um how are communities kind of
working together to manage their local resources can we do things like insourcing um community
wealth building where local institutions work together to let's say buy services from local
firms to create local jobs all of this sort of like not particularly revolutionary stuff but stuff
that would have a real impact on people's lives and now now that she's in power all of that's out the
window and it's not just because she suddenly changed her mind it's because all of the pressure
around her comes from the executives whose wealth and power depends upon the idea that there's going
to be growth and that's going to boost stock prices and that's going to make them rich but it goes beyond
just sort of basic corruption i feel right there's a lot of cronyism um but i'm very weary of the impetus
on the left to kind of characterize everybody else as evil and up to up to no good essentially
i think surely there's a lot more incompetence at play but also this this relationship exactly as
you're as you're talking about between the state and the market the state must also prop up the
market for a reason too like the state is getting something from the market and i worry about this
with regards to um what will happen when the oil runs out you know which is more likely to happen
than we transition away from it that's going to have a hugely negative impact on the on the untethered
economy because it's our resources that feed into the economy they're tied one for one our economy
is our material footprint um and so say we move to a renewable energy source although that word is a
bit dodgy in and of itself um that would therefore decrease the amount of money that is floating around
in the economy to then redistribute so if we can go past the kind of um you know starmer's not got a
backbone and rachel reeves is crumbling under pressure and these people are actually just
pretty boring and lack innovation innovative thoughts and imagination what's the other direction
at play here like the market the the the financial people really enjoy the state subsidizing them and
making sure that their lives get better for obvious reasons what does the state get out of
capitulating to those guys rather than the everyday economy so this comes back to what i was saying at
the beginning about the balance of power in society because you're totally right it would be absurd to
say that you know all the the politicians or the ceos are just bad guys right i would argue that the way
that they think of the world has probably been corrupted by a particular ideology that puts profit above
everything else but on some level they think that this is the right way to do things right and it's
understandable because of that imbalance of power because you know if we're not thinking about the
state as an abstract entity but as composed of particular individuals they know that for example um
if rachel reeves doesn't signal that she is serious about the nation's finances then she is going to face
um a lot of kind of disruption from bond markets if she doesn't signal to investors that she's going
to create a business-friendly environment the cbi is going to come after her and wage war against her
in the media there are going to be all these extremely powerful vested interests who come for her
and try and get her out of power and they've done that very successfully multiple times in the past
right so how do you fight back against that well there has to be a counterforce now what's the
counterforce right if politicians the thing i like to say i think i said in an interview with the
times which they made out to to portray me is very scary was that politicians need to be as scared of
the people voting for them as they are of the people writing the checks and they're not right now because
the only threat to their power are the people funding them the people who are able to kind of
influence narratives about you know government competency who are able to organize very
effectively to make sure that their wishes are enacted we used to have mass democracies where
politicians were concerned about protests in the streets about workers who could shut down the economy
literally if you know work if the bosses said we're not going to give you wage increases workers
were like well fine we're not going to come to work and then things just shut down so there was a much
great a much more even balance there because politicians had to consider the needs of workers
just as they had to consider the needs of businesses that was the foundation of social democracy
it was the fact you had this relatively even balance between workers and bosses and politicians in the
middle trying to mediate between these two groups that's what we lost is a sense of the collective
power of ordinary people both because the labor movement has been crushed but also because and this
is where i told you i'm writing this new book about individualism this is where my interest in this idea
of individualism comes through because yes the labor movement has been crushed and there are lots of
barriers that have been put in place to organizing but that doesn't explain the complete collapse of unions it
doesn't explain the complete collapse of mass democracy and participation in politics it doesn't
explain the complete and utter distrust most people have in political parties and politicians it doesn't
explain the decline in community life and social life it doesn't explain why we don't trust each other
anymore and why we all genuinely believe i have to compete with everyone else to survive and there's no way we
can cooperate ourselves out of this mess that is an ideology it's a very very powerful ideology because
it's what stops us from coming together and going to someone like rachel reeves and saying you have
to listen to us because we're all too busy competing pushing each other out of the way to try and get
what we want to be able to express a collective interest whereas those at the top are very good at
cooperating ironically when we're told we live in this competitive capitalist society where businesses are
constantly jostling to get to the top they cooperate very very effectively and we don't
i think it's such such a good point this idea of um you know big c conservatives actually being like
hugely humanitarian as long as you are within their community and the amount of effort exactly
as you're saying that has gone in to deliberately divide us because the numbers are on our side the
safety and numbers in the majority it's all here um and i can't wait to read your new book because
that understanding had that sense of um solitude has permeated everything we do and even on the left
you know how i think ash ash sarkar's new book is sort of about this and i'm gonna riff on it a little
bit but essentially this idea that like even you know a a politics of liberation has become about self
and identity rather than a communal movement and to benefit everybody it's it's an absolute travesty or on
the left how you know there's so many factions between us rather than again this attempt to
coalesce and come together let alone go to the other side and be like listen we have different
politics but we have pretty similar goals because things are pretty shit aren't they you know why
don't you come on over it's warm over here um so i think that's a great point i am aware that we're
running out of time um and i really want you to talk about your latest project that you've just
launched before we close so please you've been analyzing the situation for over a decade now
uh you're one of the pressing but yes i suppose yeah and things haven't gotten better so grace what
can we do about it i'm glad you asked because i've just started a substack called what can we do
no look i've realized like i get this question all the time and i think i started off my career
analyzing the problem a lot because that's what i found so interesting you know part of the reason
i started doing this it was partly because i wanted to change the world but it was also because
i love the ideas i love understanding the way that capitalism works and i got very very embedded in
communities where that was like the be all and end all and it's been recently that i've been like okay
no understanding things is not enough and it's also not enough to do what i had been doing before then
which was kind of policy work saying well if we could implement this set of solutions then things
would be better and then just handing over a list of policies and saying do this right because if
you don't have a political movement that's capable of making those demands known nothing's gonna happen
so i decided it was about time that i started coming up with an answer to this question what can
we do but i also realized that i was not as a kind of political economist best placed to be able to
do that on my own so i've started doing interviews uh every week with people in different parts of
this movement and i use a very broad understanding of what this movement is it's from you know the
labor movement to climate activists to community organizers trying to save you know their green
spaces and their libraries it's a very very broad understanding of what it means to participate in
any form of collective organizing because i want to give anyone a route in to thinking okay well actually
there's something that i could do right now to challenge the state of the world or actually
to win something because people are winning you know starbucks workers amazon workers taking on the
biggest corporations on the planet and being able to form unions after we've been told that they're dead
like climate activists being able to like stop pipelines community organizers indigenous activists being
able to save their places like all of this stuff is happening and you know it because this is what
you do as well like there are so many hopeful stories out there um but we are so wedded to doom
scrolling that we just don't want to see it so yeah check out my my sub stack what can we do and uh
there'll be a new story up there every week that hopefully will give you a bit of optimism
excellent well thank you grace i think news like that is so important in today's world uh just to
remind everyone that there are multiple worlds all here all the time existing all around us it's not
just this kind of like neoliberal hellscape that's affecting you know actually a pretty small percentage
of the world population if you think about it in a sense um my final question for you is who would you
like to platform oh i haven't thought about this one okay who uh who are my people um so i like
some of my favorite people at the moment and this is just off the top of my head because i have
another chance to think about it michaela loach a wonderful climate activist um and an author
my friend adele walton has just released her first book and she's a really really interesting thinker
um and you those are my my people who are in my brain right now so yeah
well brilliant well i will reach out to michaela and adele and try to get them both on the show to
continue the conversation yeah thank you so much for your time and for all of your work you are such a
