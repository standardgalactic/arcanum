these people are cheering on pro far later than some of the others the brutality of the ussr
at like rand would not have wanted to be in the same room with these people
and because of this and i think that issue made me you know that they're on the opposite sides
of this kind of great divide i think really matters and really matters to how you judge them
like can you have been honestly a supporter of stalin welcome everyone to our discussion of
the visionaries by wolfram eilenberger i have before me today a panel of discussants who
have lots of reasons to want to talk about this book the book i should read the subtitle of
arendt bovar rand they and the power of philosophy in dark times so one of the subjects of this book
these are four philosophers uh all of them women living in the middle of the 20th century
and one of them ayn rand is is someone that all of us have a special interest in uh and that's why
i've assembled this group of of people to discuss the book today so let me quickly introduce these
people before we get into the thick of things uh first we have greg salmieri who is a senior scholar
of philosophy at the salem center at the university of texas he's also the editor of the blackwell
companion to ayn rand so there's uh something that tells you about why he's interested in rand
uh we have my colleague jason rines who's a fellow and instructor at the ayn rand institute formerly a
philosophy professor uh and a expert in ancient philosophy and we have shoshana milgram who is a
professor of english at virginia tech she's written on subjects ranging from nabokov to steinbeck she's a
specialist in ayn rand she's currently working on ayn rand's biography and i am ben bear i'm also fellow and
instructor at the ayn rand institute with jason uh also formerly a philosophy professor and uh i saw
this book uh advertised uh i think a few months ago and i read a review of it in the new york times and i
said well we i'd better read this and part of my interest of course a big part of my interest was
that rand is featured and uh i was interested to see that she was being put into a kind of virtual
conversation with uh these other contemporary thinkers of her day um who are most of whom are
taken quite seriously by uh by thinkers today by uh philosophy departments today rand is not usually
taken so seriously so it was interesting to see an author uh putting her into conversation and wanted to
see what the result was so what do we want to say about this um well i said i think we said we were
going to go around and first ask everyone for their general take on the book and then we'll we'll dig into
the reasons for those takes and i'll i'll share mine once i've heard the rest of you why don't we start
with you greg um i also was attracted to the book because uh it had ran in it it's one of a couple of
books that came out i guess in the last year this one came out in in german before but came out in
english in the last year that um treats rand in parallel with other figures so i was intrigued by
that trend there's um freedom's furies by sandifer which talks about rand along with isabel patterson
and rose wilder lane and um there's the individualists by tomasi and walinsky that talks about
various thinkers that it uses libertarian and so i see it as a kind of part of a literature that's
growing where rand's putting conversation with people i was interested to see that i was pleased
that the author seems to be taking her very seriously and taking all the figures seriously
i didn't feel like he was casting shade on them he was uh trying to be fair to their views and i thought
largely was fair to the content of their views where i knew it um it's easier for me to judge with rand
than with the other figures i was a little there were topics in rand's thought that it seemed to me odd he
didn't bring up given the things he did in the other thinkers thought and i have a feeling if i
knew each of the other figures well i would have the same impression it felt a little bit random what
he included and we didn't and the book felt a little disunified but i uh overall was happy to see it and
um it was thought-provoking uh shashana how about you okay well i i pre-ordered this book i was very
interested in seeing what he would do because all four of the figures are of some interest even though
i'm most interested in ayn rand hana arend would be the second one that i'm interested in and and read
uh what i also noticed that appealed to me from the beginning was the the title in german was different
and the title in german in some ways is better you know it's the it's the the fire of freedom uh the
rescue of philosophy in you know difficult times and i thought oh philosophy needs needs to be
rescued so that was interesting that he was going to be talking about philosophy and not just politics
even though the dark times led me to think that he would be talking about the time i also was
interested in the fact that it was limited by period 1933 to 1943 which does take us up to ayn rand's
first best-selling novel and one that she was always proud to have written when i read it i did
i admit i did look at the ayn rand parts first then i didn't notice what i thought was what some
inaccuracies but i thought well i'm going to read the book from the beginning and see how how it goes
because i was not as expert certainly not any kind of an expert on simone de beauvoir when i started
reading that i thought let me check some of what i see here and i actually had trouble with some of
the accuracy of what he said about de beauvoir right from the start and not even the sort of thing that's
a matter of interpretation but he has a note and then i look up the note and it does not say what he's
just summarized it as being well that was useful because that led me to see what i was going to see in
the book which is a big view by someone who is enthusiastic and exciting and maybe even in some
ways would like to be a novelist himself and a philosopher and so he's allows his enthusiasm to
make him rush by niggling details which some niggling details are important you know you can call it
nick picking to criticize errors but if you don't pick the nits you're going to end up with a head full of
lice so i think it is important to try to get things right and frankly that's important to henna
aret she talks about the importance of truth and what totalitarianism does is that it erases the
difference between truth and falsehood so i have to say that i started reading it more as a novel and
as an impression than as something that i could take as a source jason how about you um so the way he
conceives of this project it's interesting to play off what shoshana just said is he thinks of it as a
kind of non-fiction novel where he's balancing sort of four characters and that's how he thought of
his previous book um the time of the magicians um and he planned a third one in a sort of trilogy we
don't know which four figures it was but he describes it as he knows how to sort of juggle four
balls at once and that's why he does these but he doesn't think of it as a kind of group biography like
biography of the bloomsbury group because they're these figures are not really directly in dialogue
with one another briefly de beauvoir notes vi and they talked once um but uh and there's a sense in
which he kind of creates a axis in which vi and rand are two polar ends and that's sort of obvious in a
way but um uh but he he's he picks a certain period of time which is not the most fruitful period of
time to get the magna opera of these of these women thinkers it's too early and he knows he knows that
but he his interest he said in interviews is the intersection of philosophy and biography and like
how what role philosophy plays in a person's actual lived life um he also thinks that current academic
philosophy is both stylistically and intellectually moribund i don't disagree and he finds it interesting
both that these four women want um all of them when he was in graduate school would not have been called
philosophers now they would um all of them wrote in forms different from the kind of arid academic
philosophical article for professional philosophers and journals all of you know they were interested in
writing fiction and journalism and so on and that's sort of what he does but i think it's ill conceived because
the you know the the the subtitle right as shoshana mentioned right um it's the the salvation by of
philosophy in in dark times now it's it's not so much the people who save philosophy though i think
he partly means that in the sense that they're keeping alive a kind of philosophy that he thinks is
worthy of a name but what he also means is that philosophy was keeping them alive under in a period of
incredible pressure and the thing is is that that kind of comes out i mean all that comes out is
these are three four incredibly intellectually precocious and intense thinkers whose lives are lives of ideas
and writing and sure okay um including the dark times in their lives sure um how it actually sort of
saved them or how it actively changed their personal lives is unclear and where he kind of weighs in on
that i think he tends to with the exception of simone vai he tends to see um a mixture of authenticity and
self-deception um like it doesn't bear out in their lives the way they you would think it doesn't
bear out in de Beauvoir's life the way you would think it doesn't bear out in in rand i think he thinks
why it really does but via didn't save her it her thought killed her um and in a very literal sense
so so i think if you wanted to create a dialogue between four women who three all of them are um
displaced with the events of world war ii um they're all women um intellectuals all born between 1905 and 1909
all writing in a non-standard formal and all of them uh anti-totalitarian in some sense and um all of
them interested in the challenging dynamic between the self and the other um you could do that and you
could make a really interesting conversation but he didn't do that he just recycled some biographies of
these people during a certain critical time period in the world and in their lives and makes hints
suggestions about how you can juxtapose them but neither does the analytical work um nor uh in
philosophically for you nor um does the kind of psychological work in a responsible and really
thoughtful way about how this was actually how these thoughts were actually changing their lives
um and and not just a kind of papering over of the problems in their lives
you know i agree i agree with what you said obviously not a work of scholarship
because in a work of scholarship you show where you've been and other people can follow you there
you document everything what i think and i think i agree with you also that it is not a book that
has a thesis and demonstrates it it's possible that he thinks that that's what other philosophers do
and he doesn't want to do that and partly in some ways one of the flaws turned into a virtue for me
because i could see he was not being accurate so i thought if i want to really know i i have to check it
out for myself and he made the characters seem interesting but i think you're right in that the
whole doesn't add up and that the very the very thing you mentioned about the conversation is only
hinted at in one there's one place where he has just set out ayn rand and her ideas it's around page 306
something like that and he says what would the other three do if they were going to discuss her ideas
and i and would they and he didn't name them but he said would they think this would they think that
and i thought you know that sounds like a really good book yeah you know that that would that would
be the heart of an actual conversation but it's almost as if he leaves that to the reader yeah this
would be okay as notes for a book you plan on writing maybe but not yet the book or background um and
i should just mention um in terms of he wasn't trying to do a defend a thesis and that's maybe what
he thinks other philosophers do i think that's quite correct he his dissertation was on michael bakhtin
and he says that one of the themes he's interested in pursuing in his work is a concept of of polyphony
of just different voices and putting them side by side um and i think one part of that is just having
these different thinkers say what they're saying in a certain period of time or think what they're
thinking but i think it's also sort of leaving it to the reader to make any kind of judgments about
why how they would relate to one another um but in a way i mean you did the work of picking your
subjects and picking your time frame that's most of that's most of the the of the step towards a kind
of editorial or point of view already so so now say something about it and i don't think he does
i will say one thing i liked is that it does he is a he was attracted to these women for i think all
even if misguided sometimes good reasons in in a sense um their intelligence um their uh intellectual
yes they're they're uh they're kind of willing to do figure it out right the way they want to write
um and they're there and i think he thinks also in certain sense their their courage or
maybe it's bravado sometimes that they all they all think you know it's the world that's wrong i'm
right um and i'm gonna defend it before i uh what did you think man before i share my take i think we
should get clear on one important thing which is pronunciation of the second simone's last name
because i've heard each of you say it differently and according to the audiobook version that i
listened to and the wikipedia pronunciation guy it's vee simone vee oh sorry and uh but you know it
you it's to be understood that it would be pronounced it with a spell w-e-i-l um sorry i guess because
it's a german name we tend to pronounce it in a german way and but it's she was she didn't yeah i guess
she didn't write in she didn't write in german yeah okay so i i thought this was a very interesting
book to read especially because of the kind of novelistic quality of it where you're not just
reading about their ideas but you're seeing uh what's happening in their lives especially against
the backdrop of some pretty dramatic uh geopolitical events of the period i mean this is this people
talk about how bad things are politically these days and i was reminded uh how much better things
are uh in comparison with mid 20th century europe uh by reading this book but as to the treatment of
the figures so the one that i knew the most about was rand the one that i knew the least about was
simone vee and so i was interested to learn about all these figures uh and but also to be able to
to make estimates about how accurate he must be in presentations of their views based on
my knowledge of line rand and how well he's presenting her and on the whole i thought it was
better than a lot of other treatments of rand by non-fans uh but still there are definitely things to
uh to critique and we'll hopefully talk about some of those later uh one thing i would say is that i
about that is that i i read this book one and a half times so i tried to finish reading it a second
time that would have to be better in my memory and on the second pass through although i didn't make it
all the way i i was definitely noticing uh more problems with the presentation of rand than i did the
first time um mostly because i think there were double standards uh by which she was being judged uh she
the author is holding her to standards that he doesn't hold others to and i'll maybe mention some of
those examples later um but uh it gave me the sense that he was trying to take her seriously
in the eyes of the audience without necessarily really taking her as seriously as he could have
um but but uh like i said we'll go into some details about that later uh jason in your comments
on the book can i just um uh or if we're gonna go into it later but let me just say that i think i don't
think he's doing it as a double standard in the sense of like he isn't taking her seriously i think
he's very dependent on the secondary sources and what they do wrong he kind of repeats well i think
he also has the sort of style where if he thinks he has something interesting to say he'll say it and
he won't necessarily check his his work um and and so and yes it is more forgiving of vein as compared
to the other three um but i don't think it's like at least from things i've seen i think he thinks he's
he's generally interested in what brand is saying and what she's doing um and is impressed as with her
as a person even if he doesn't agree with the ideas but so yeah it can come off like well that's
more unfair to her than it is on this than he was with some other dimension of somebody else but i don't
it it's almost giving him too much credit to say that it's a double standard i just think it's
he's just sloppy and kind of hit or miss treatment of random nietzsche i thought was the weakest thing
about his treatment of rand he reads her through nietzsche um and doesn't think enough about points
where she's did where she's different including in places where he sort of indicates them once or
twice early on he indicates things but then that just goes by the wayside and rand is a nietzschean
and there's not thought about well how is how she's similar and different from nietzsche
relevant here and that's particularly important if you're thinking about rand's thinking through the
period of totalitarianism what does she make of the nazis what does she make of the communists what
does she make of the right kind of social relationship and again it's not like you could
read the book and not see that there's a difference but it's so in the background um and i think that's
the worst problem in the treatment of her i think for the benefit of our audience and we've we've
referenced simone vee a few times now uh she's one of these four subjects of the book we should we should
say something about the ideas about her what her ideas and maybe this is a way of easing into uh
discussion of what the theme of the book is it came up already once in this conversation that
there's a way in which the author rightly portrays rand's ideas as antithetical to vees they're kind
of perfect antipodes in a way and uh so we know ayn rand is an advocate of individualism of a kind of
ethical egoism and laissez-faire capitalism and jason how would you characterize vee's very different ideas
they um begins as a marxist then becomes a um a non-marxist socialist um kind of trade unionist
and then she becomes a catholic christian mystic um the through line throughout her entire uh intellectual
life is an extremely intense form of of altruism and a notion of um once both more obligations to
others um though that somewhat shifts at the very end towards obligations to god um
she's um she is anti-totalitarian in the sense that she denounced both the soviet union and the nazis and
like rand was one of the early people who was pointing out that these are really the same
i mean that's basic they in a nutshell is for most of her life just intensely um
preoccupied with others and their suffering and that there is just absolute moral obligation to do
something about the suffering of others that nobody really has a right to be happy or alive while others
are dying and suffering um that's the kind of essence of her for most of her life and then it
eventually becomes um i have this god is talking to me and catholicism is the real thing and it becomes
even a kind of platonism where real values are transcendent not of this world um the respective
values of this world including even the ego is an illusion and a sacrilege that's more or less
vey as i understand her and what's what's especially interesting about vey is that she's so intense
about at least trying to practice what she preaches which gets to the the issue of how this book is
part of what this book is about is uh the use of philosophy in life not just in an academic setting
because so she early in her life when she's a marxist she goes to work uh in the factories so that she can
experience what it's like to be uh a a laborer and to deal with the alleged oppression of the capitalists in the
system and then she goes to fight in the spanish civil war in her uh very amateur kind of way but she's putting
herself uh in constant threat in constant mortal peril and then later moves to you know working for if not fighting
for the free french and their uh resistance against the the nazis now she's a she's a slight uh and sickly
uh uh young woman who's not able to handle most of the physically demanding uh tasks that she puts
herself up to but she's she doesn't seem to care about uh her health or well-being and uh it's it's
always about finding the most suffering people and working to fight to fight for them it's more than
that she wants to suffer and she wants it to be very public and seen it's really martyrdom like i
want and and it's it's worse than just she's not up to the task it's i'm putting in danger other
people's careers and lives so that i can be such a conspicuous martyr i'm gonna go and really understand
the workers meanwhile her very well-to-do parents can save her at any minute he buys her bs she's a
tourist right um there's a there's a really nasty moment where de beauvoir is talking to vai the
one time they had a conversation and vive simultaneously it acts like morally holier than thou art and makes
a crack about de beauvoir's appearance and says it's clear that you've never gone hungry well simone vine
never had to go hungry she just refused to eat um in a very conspicuous way and and probably drove
her parents who enable her to desperation hoping that she wouldn't starve herself today which she
eventually did um and and and so and even though she changes her ideas over time the holier than thou
attitude and the i have this i it's the most important thing in the world is for everybody to see me
martyring myself never goes away and i island burger seems to confuse the recklessness of it
with courage and i don't think it's courageous i think it's neurotic but what well i think that what
he what he likes is that she's not a hypocrite okay and you could say look what she's not a hypocrite about
but at least you know she she walks the walk and not she doesn't just talk the talk but she doesn't
i i think that what well what she actually does is she puts herself at risk um she has that accident
with the boiling oil and that's why she doesn't go off to serve but not every single idea of hers
is about throwing her life away she had that idea about a squad of nurses who were trained to go into
the dangerous other women's lives away yeah no no she was going to do it herself and them yeah okay but
the idea though is that that's not for nothing you know going into a dangerous place as a trained
nurse is not for nothing what she wanted to get done in that case as i remember from the text
it wasn't even that she thought the nurses would be able to accomplish anything it was that it would
be a dramatic demonstration of the difference in the world views between fascism and and ultra altruism
where for that to really work the nurses need to need to die or uh well i think it's especially
trained so you know why they throw away the training but actually trained to die i mean like
to do this triage in the middle of battlefields but but i think ben's right like the whole idea is that
this will become they will be martyrs right and they will prove to the world as if the world didn't
understand this nazis are bad um you're good only her notion of goodness is is by say rand's uh
understanding the very thing that caused nazism in the first place yeah yeah that for morality for her
amounts to being willing to suffer you were mentioning the eating um one of the incidents
reported from a friend of hers who also was the one who's the biographical source is that she was at
the table with her parents and the question came up of what would happen if a german landed here would
you turn him in and so on and father said of course and she said okay i'm not eating with you
you know i will i won't share a table with you when exactly this issue of not eating
yeah it's a kind of power assuming power by threatening them with her own suffering there are
two issues with with vey one is is what she's after a kind of self-aggrandizement in people's eyes
watch me suffer watch how much of a martyr i am etc um or is it the literal to be a martyr it's not
so much about people seeing her but but she just wants to martyr herself i don't know which it is i
don't think the the second is any better than the first if anything i think it's worse um but it's pretty
clear there's not a kind of causal thinking about how best to alleviate the suffering of whoever it is
not that i think that's what somebody should focus their lives around but i think one shouldn't uh but
the altruism in general is and becomes it has to be a fetishizing of suffering and i think that's what
we really see in vey's life it's all about the suffering and being around the suffering and seeing
if i could have some of the suffering of the sufferers and there's very little actual even attempt
to better anyone's life including her own it's really gross so we've gotten some of vey's views
on the table uh you can see then why uh the author would characterize her as an as a kind of antipode
to ayn rand ayn rand the author of the virtue of selfishness who was a critic of all forms of self
sacrifice would have certainly uh seen the views of vey as uh contemptible did see that those views
as contemptible um i think that gives us a little bit to say more about the theme of the book because
what does what do these four figures have in common with each other why why talk about them well you
see already vey and rand are antipodes on a certain question they're antipodes on a on a question about
about morality about ethics about life and society on the basis of that they're struggling over what
is the relationship between the self and society uh and de beauvoir and arend are also uh also struggling
with that same question and taking up different kinds of positions on the spectrum of the relationship
between self and others de beauvoir is described as being mostly politically uninterested in this book
but still struggling to understand otherness and its role in defining one's own meaning in life and
arend uh is also as a uh as a german jew living in the 30s and 40s thinking about what is the role
of one's membership in a tribe and a nation uh in making one a victim uh how does one defend oneself
in this kind of situation uh and and what is it possible to define oneself or does history and
position define you beyond yes um any or is any attempt to kind of look beyond that essentially a kind
of self-deception about the facts one of the things i found interesting about the the four of
them is that even though there are big huge differences say between uh they and rand especially
there there's at least there's a way in which the author at least is suggesting and there's a question
is this the right interpretation but there's a way in which the author is suggesting that each of them
has a sort of quasi individualistic street so even they uh who's opposite of rand is described as
being an individualist socialist and the reason that she objects to capitalism is because she
sees it as oppressing the individual by making him into a into the cog of a machine and that's part of
the reason that she goes into the factory to experience what that's like uh and there are similar things to
say about de beauvoir and arend each of them and they're in one way or another put some kind of emphasis
on the importance of defining one's own existence thinking for oneself uh i suspect they mean very different
things by those concepts than what rand means by them for instance but i think this is the part of
the thematic unity and i wonder what the rest of you think about what the author is trying to say about
this general idea about the role of these figures in this idea uh if there's an idea here at all is this
really a thematic unity or or is it is it uh only superficial resemblances thoughts on this
i i think they are all dealing with this question of self and other i think with they it's just the
same old wine in actually the same old bottle um it's just the ancient altruism kind of thing i think
de beauvoir and arend is thinking about it in terms of how history and society may define us and how we may
have to try to define ourselves in light of it the parvenu and the pariah and and what that what what it
means to you when you're not part of any society as a refugee that's part of her thought um i think
beauvoir and rand kind of more more about on the same page at like a deep psychological level how do
you define yourself your thought in regard to the other do you think for yourself does the other affect
you can they defect you all the way down so i think in this formative years random de beauvoir really
coming to grips with very similar questions along these lines and unless we think that it's just
how she's framing it in the fountainhead of sort of the first-handed second-handed the self or other
i mean when she does sketches for a present presentation of her philosophical system after
writing her magnum opus at the shrug one of the things she first says is like basic kind of distinction
like self and other um as as a kind of cognitive step of the the child just figuring out what they
are and when she describes how the you know the worst kind of intellectuals go wrong early on in their
lives it's in part psychologically in terms of their sort of terror and uh obeisance to the minds of
others and things like that so it goes pretty deep i think yeah i agree with that i think that he does
underline a particular question of all of them wrestled with the question of who am i and who am i in the
world and who are these other people now it's almost as if the philosophy is written in the first person
and even when it's not using the first person i think that's one of the reasons when he's talking about
ayn rand he's leading up to rourke and says rourke is speaking for ayn rand which you know that's that's
true uh but i think that's the connection for him between the biography and the philosophy is that the
others are also and he mentions that a number of times are speaking for themselves and whether hannah
is writing about um a she says that rachel barnhayden was would have been her best friend but she
died a hundred years ago you know it's um it's almost as if she also is writing in the first
person when she's writing that that that that treatment of her which um you know becomes the book
and de beauvoir writes herself into her fiction so yes it's uh it is an issue the self and the other
and the individual and the mob or the collective but it comes up in both well actually the way you
iran put it you know individual versus collectives are not in politics but in the soul and i think
you could say not only in politics but in the soul i think that is that's a through line that's something
that they're all interested in and in in a broad sense you know in a broad and deep sense even if
they don't mean the same things yeah i genuinely thought wow a kind of deep comparison of de beauvoir and
ran sort of thought about a number of issues including um we now call gender sexuality but
also just the self and the other but actually be could could be potentially very enlightening um
and i mean i found it interesting assuming he's right about this that one novel de beauvoir was
doing was supposed to be you know self and other in kind of one's personal life and then she wanted to
go branch out and look at that same dynamic at the political social level and that's what rand
sets out to do after finishing the fountainhead and turning to atlas shrugged you know it grew beyond
that sure but you see it's also personal and the way he puts it and i think this is a correct
identification is that all of them noticed that other people weren't like them yeah and that had
conflict that had implications because especially for some of them they wanted to think of themselves as
associated with other people or as immersed in other people or subsumed in other people and
i'm right of course didn't think that but well if i'm different from other people then how can i
understand them and live with them i they he mentioned that and he really had it's right it's
around page 200 or so i mean i'm sure you remember it's it's very striking because that's the fundamental
question of how do they fit in the world he suggested and other people and this is where
he ought to be bringing in the beginning of the fountainhead where howard work is thinking there's
a difference between me and this dean and i don't understand it what is it and uh and um he suggested
also that is um eilenberger suggested not work that this question of i'm different from other people
how do i fit it uh how do i make sense of this is not just a question that these four women
struggled with but it's somehow central to philosophizing or where philosophy begins uh
i think maybe that's too broad a claim but it's a plausible claim and it's an interesting claim that
at least a lot of people's intellectual journeys a lot of the most interesting people's intellectual
journeys include that as an element to it and that's you know sort of one of the things that's
brought up not too much explored but maybe that's your style he wants to drop ideas and get you
thinking about them rather than than work and i thought that was an interesting thought
so there were a lot of thinkers in this period who were struggling with questions about the
relationship between self and others not just these four and one wonders then why it was these four
of all of them who were chosen and especially why why are all four of them women is there something
important about that now you can speculate about uh what's faddish in academia being part of the
reason why he why he chose four women um that by itself might not be a good reason to group them
together but is there anything interesting about the fact that all four of them are women and anything
that we can learn from this and about the fact that four women intellectuals in this period female
intellectuals in this period are all thinking about the same kinds of questions or not i mean so this
comes up and it's coming like in interviews with him and he seems to think like yeah no there may well
be some interesting things to draw out that all being women in this time period etc you therefore see but
he also could think i'm not going to make that call i'm not going to kind of make the claim that
it's relevant in this way or that way i think it is relevant in the just how smart they had to be
to make a kind of impact as as a woman in that time and really be noticed even if posthumously so
that's part of it i think part of it is just that they all of them are likely to be very kind of
determined to to think what they're going to think and say what they're going to say and work it out
and whether or not society thinks that's the business they should be in and that's what draws
him i think to all of them um he admires that in all of them um and rightly so um but he also says you
know um and i think this this explains something for me which is that um in this period
none of them are particularly interested in what it means for their life or thinking that they are
women now eventually de Beauvoir would write the second sex right the most important work of
feminism in the 20th century right so it's not that she didn't think about this stuff
okay so there is a place in this book where it again you probably know more about de Beauvoir's
original text than i do but at least pages 88 to 89 uh the author is saying that according to de Beauvoir
this passage that he quotes from her is a prime example of Beauvoir's lifelong conviction that the
intellectual dispositions of men and women are generically different and uh talks about the
difference between plasticity versus rigidity and it's it's a passage about uh men being more likely to
get sucked into the lunacies known as philosophical systems systems women are not by nature prone to
obsessions of this type so she does have the view that there's this differently female way of thinking
and i have more to say that but let me hear what you have to say oh well if you look right there it
says that she recorded this in the late 1950s okay at a time when the second sex 1949 um you know was
already 10 years old so i think it's fair to say that to read this back into the earlier time is maybe
something like what we call retcon um i see so jason you were making a point about the earlier de Beauvoir
gonna say i don't necessarily think he's reading this passage correctly that is i don't think that
we should think that when de Beauvoir is saying this she doesn't have in mind the fact that all
of this is modulated by the roles that society puts women in um she's acutely aware of that right
now she thinks that ultimately there there is a biological slash historical explanation of how
men came to dominate over women and and de Beauvoir thinks that women are just more victim to the
biological needs of the species that they just have to suffer more for which probably is true um um and
no it is true um but uh um but i don't think she thinks that there are she doesn't believe in
evolutionary psychological differences of men and women how they think that's not i think this is
just another example where he kind of crudely misreads things and again i don't know this passage
from her journals particularly well but everything i know about de Beauvoir's later thought in the second
sex makes me very suspicious of this reading and i can point to lots of places where he badly misreads other
philosophical texts that i know well well that's even more interesting than uh for me because what
thinking about this issue led me to was that if you so if you don't think that there are genetic
differences in the way that men and women think uh as as i i don't uh then there's still a question of
well then why are why does someone like the author fall for this uh idea and more broadly why are men
and women treated differently uh when it comes to their role as thinkers such that a woman would have
to work harder to be taken seriously and i'm reminded of a point that i think some of us
uh must remember from a old lecture by uh dr leonard picoff who's one of uh ayn rand's students uh
talking about differences in male versus female psycho-epistemologies uh where the difference isn't
because of uh genetic difference but because of uh socially culturally uh uh entrenched habits that
that are that that are stereotypically associated with one gender or another and that uh he talks
about how the men who are fans of ayn rand tend to be more rationalistic that and and to be inhabit
realms of floating abstraction whereas the women tend to be more focused on concrete experiences
and that made me think that the i mean that's not just something about objectivism it's about
intellectuals in in in many different fields i think it's significant let me finish the point
though about leonard's lecture that it wasn't a lecture on differences between men and women it was
a difference on a lecture on two bad ways of thinking and then he mentioned you know because
of these various factors of how we're raised one tends to have more men fall into it and one tends
to have more women fall into it right and so i started this conversation with
the question is there anything interesting or significant about the fact that all four of these
figures are women and one of the things that we had said earlier was that they do all have
uncharacteristic ways of doing philosophy they're all very interested in the living of a philosophy and
in the concrete experiences that inform a philosophy and so some of them write fiction and some of them go
and and live out the life of that idea as opposed to in all cases focusing on these abstract treatises
that you get published in journal articles and so it does seem to me you know for whatever reason
because our cultures have decided that men are supposed to be analytical and women are supposed to be
emotional and experience based that this you would expect this kind of philosophy to come with from
women in this period where uh they're not beholden to the stereotype of what it means to be an
intellectual because because they're women and and in in many ways this is for the better because
it it it does bring philosophy down to earth in a way that in the the world of male intellectualism
uh it gets lost i don't i think there is actually something ben to what what you're saying about it it um
um there being um certain pathologies of academic philosophy and it being connected in various ways
to its being an old boys network and so forth but in this book we have two examples of men who forged
this similar kind of literary journalistic philosophical career path we have sartre of course
all the time with the beaufort and you have camus and then of course you have philippa foot um elizabeth
and scone uh so women in the same period who are taking a more academic approach so it's not um
you know one could be too uh one could make too much of that point but i don't think it's entirely
a coincidence that um some of these more iconoclastic figures who are charting a different course are
women when it's harder to do that in the um in the academy yeah and fair point about starches
and there's nothingness sorry but the point about the and in the case of so there are also two
recent books of the kind of of these of four um women from oxford um philippa foot elizabeth
anscombe mary midgley and um iris murdoch um murdoch and midgley had non-standard academic
career kind of things as writers but philosophers um but even foot and anscombe sort of like
acknowledged and midgley acknowledges um that had it not been for the total um mobilization of
men from oxford during the war they would not have come up the way that they did in the academy
um so it may just be the circumstances of being able to get to the u.s or being you know um something
like that really changes the trajectory i think we should definitely come back to the question of
the book's treatment of rand uh since that is many of our entree into the book and we've touched a
little bit already on some of the we've briefly touched on some of what we thought was uh misrepresentative
of her thought uh we should dig a little deeper into that may i offer a bridge from what we were just
talking about to that sure so there's one point at which eilenberger takes a very um kind of critical
or suspicious read on rand's more than one place a relationship with her husband frank o'connor and in
particular thinks that the kind of role she has in the relationship is inconsistent with her own
characters and heroines sort of sense of of sexual gender roles and a woman wanting to have this
dominant man in their life and so on where in fact he thinks she was and he even sort of says she's the
man in the family and i think to bring this back to a question that one of you raised a few moments ago
one of the reasons that i think eilenberger does is he has certain gender assumptions himself about what
performing maleness and female masculinity and femininity would look like and then his reading
kind of ran in part through that interpretation as well
is that is exactly the passage that uh i had in mind when i was talking about different standards for
interpreting and judging these these figures and uh why i think rand is getting the short stick in in this
case so this is this is pages 126 to 127 she shares this uh this letter uh with that rand had written
to her husband and talks about how she misses him but she doesn't really miss him and uh because she's
gone off to to work on her uh on her writing in a separate place a howard work we can say with some
certainty would never have set such things down on paper just as one does not need to have the eye of a
trained couples therapist to detect considerable potential for tension in these lines the role
play is still intact while the roles themselves shifted long ago and it's like well yes one does
need the eye of a trained couples therapist to infer about these kinds of things and why is it that
you are taking on that role mr eilenberger uh of of psychologizing rand in this case when you're not
doing that in the case of someone like simone simone vey's religious experience which is described on page
168 to 169 uh where she experienced herself in the form of jesus christ entirely imbued with divine love
etc asking no psychological questions about whether the fact that she's actually in the hospital for a
neurological condition at the time might have had something to do with uh her uh misinterpretations
where you wouldn't actually need to be a trained therapist to ask the question but it's not asked
and that strikes me as rather and also the kind of commentary on rend and her husband's relationship
when there's a kind of judgment there about a kind of faking involved and there's so much less of that
when he's talking about a dubovar in effect acting as a procurer for um for sartre um and if you're
going to start reading it's not like he doesn't show that there are some things a little dubious about
their uh little family but the there's not the same degree and the other thing was that letter
you should explain what you mean by the procurer there by the way scoping out young students and
bringing them to to sleep with sartre and her um but the pattern the pattern is she took up
relationships with her former students who were younger than her and then often those then became
the lovers not only of her but then of sartre and in one at least case she's explicitly thinking
oh this would be good for him this will get him out of his funk now the first place he brings this
up he describes it as clearly predatory but then he drops that and he cites a bit from her journal
where she's wondering how much she's living up to these existentialist notions of being self-determined
or how much is she just wants a husband and you know and that's and it's most interesting because it
comes from her but there's a lot of uh of passing over some really dark stuff in those in those passages
he's he's he's almost immediately dismissing the fact that she might be jealous and saying no because
she's telling us she's not jealous she's telling us she's just trying to live by the strictures of
existentialism and uh there's at least a pretty good case for the fact that there was a degree of
jealousy there uh which is just dismissed i should say i don't think i read him a little differently
there i think he with de beauvoir he's pretty clear at various points that he thinks she's putting
herself on um my my kind of but i do see a difference between the treatment of de beauvoir and ran that he
doesn't even consider the possibility that ran feels about her husband the way she says she feels
yeah and it's just the other thing is that letter that he quotes um i don't think anybody just reading
that letter would get what he says he gets out of that letter i think the reason he puts that control
on that letter is because that's how rand and frank's relationship is portrayed in um the various
biographies of france whether for for for good or ill whether it's an accurate portrayal or not i don't
think anybody just reading that letter would read any of the things about role reversal or whatever that
he's reading into it i think he has a narrative about her life that he's and about a relationship
that he's picking up from these other biographies yeah whether put aside whether it's accurate or not
and then he's just reading that letter in light of it in a way that i if you just read it it's
uh it's a woman talking to her husband who's just left and uh you don't get any i don't there's not
not objectively in there alone outside of that context anything that would even lead you to suspect that
um and so then we could talk about what is the narrative on rand's relationship that one gets
in biographies how accurate is it but there's something odd that he's doing he's not showing
us why he's thinking the way he's thinking there's definitely a good possibility necessarily even
site where he's getting the information from i mean over on um 180 he said that uh frank
rand says seemed not remotely inclined to provide spontaneous service to rand's increasingly elaborate
fantasies of seizing possession of the world quote like an animal unquote okay i don't even know what
that sort of means except that i did follow up the quotation and it is from the journalist's
description of rourke as being like a healthy animal and in the other time within the book when
he uses the quotation he gets it correct and so here he's and it's not about seizing possession
of the world there isn't anything about elaborate fantasies and so it looks as if he's got a source
but he hasn't even done it accurately and it doesn't say what he says he's it's supposed to be saying so
he's he's made it up um and of course as you say he's made it up because of some things that he's read
but he's not even saying sometimes he says my account of this comes from so and so but he doesn't
he doesn't always do that he just assumes that the reader will go along with him the idea that he's
getting this from these other biographies is definitely plausible uh what occurred to me is that
we're not it's not it's hard to prove that because psychologizing by which i mean uh
uh trying to explain someone's behavior by unfounded psychological speculation psychology
psychologizing is just so dominant and widespread among intellectuals across the board he wouldn't
need to get it from the biographies then again he doesn't do it to some of these other figures in the
same way and so that could either be just bias of his against against rand or or it could be the
biography but it's not just that it's that there's nothing in this passage that i think would lead
anybody to think that you have to have a take on you know frank's this kind of nebbishy guy who just
goes along with whatever his wife wants and she's writing about these grand heroes and he's not like
that and so forth and all that he actually says is that he had a film career that didn't go very well
and then he he went and did some other things which isn't enough to get any kind of read on what kind
of person he is so where is he getting it from and the place where you find it is that's how he's
portrayed in all these books and their assumptions as to what their sex life must be like which
there's no evidence for a little bit of evidence there is pointing the opposite direction but it's
not discussed and um you know so that's why i'm assuming he's getting from it i think maybe he didn't
read the introduction to the 1968 edition of the fountainhead i mean and that's a real source
that's ayn rand's own words and that's also where she explains the difference between herself and
nietzsche just saying i mean i think that with another writer he might have made reference to
that sort of thing and given it some credence and said where he got it from he mentioned it's pertinent
he mentioned that um that ran does okay occasionally use the bon mot of of frank in her novels yes but he
says um add to her uh regularly or typically um humorless prose and if you read the fountainhead like
it's so it's such a sarcastic hilariously snarky book in various places whether you like the philosophy
or not it's it's it's not humorless by any means nor is we the living there they have a dark and sardonic
humor in the kind of narrator and what the narrator says and doesn't say it's it's he's just not a good
reader careful but again there's this rand has this rep of being humorless right and you get it
again in how she's portrayed culturally and he just doesn't where that comes from is a good question and
why do people see her this way but i don't think like a lot of people independently see her this way
i think some book put it that way and people don't bother to look past it well i think that one of the
problems that you know with this book is that he really is so vivid and it's only when you come
upon something that you know yourself right away that that doesn't correspond with the book or the
writer or something then you you realize that you can't accept what he's saying 100 without looking into
it and that's you know it's it can interfere with the reading because you know there are these question
marks in the margin of uh i wonder what i wonder what what this what's really true here yeah he's he's
intellectually he's also i totally agree with that intellectually he's you know like some people don't
want the peas and the mashed potatoes mixing together he does not do any kind of way keeping this sort of
out in in the in the thinkers idiolect in other words you're trying to be careful you wouldn't just
put something a way that your reader might understand but a way that would also be recognizable
and syntonic for the author and there's so much that he will put you know he'll put rand's view in a
way she would never say for various reasons so for example you know that she has the same contempt
like for capitalism as social no she would never talk like that like yes she thought people were
second-handed and had little lives and so on but she would never treat them as morally equivalent or um
he often will use in talking about rand will use the platonic metaphor of leaving the cave now he makes
an interesting observation which is that there is a going underground and finding light bit in anthem but rand
in does not use the the kind of platonic cave allegory language for very good reason because
she doesn't think that the basic sense perception or the way that the common sense people of the world
is benighted and then you reach some higher vision it's i'm just more honest to the starting point where we
all start and i don't mislead myself so she has a good reason to to abjure that kind or to just have
to not want the platonic language but for him it's just like oh yeah this is language like going from
being unphilosophical to philosophical so let me throw it in but he doesn't know how the flavor pal
the flavor textures are changing when you mix the peas and the mashed potatoes and yeah well i think that
he's trying to make connections and there's a section when he's talking about ayn Rand where he
explains about human relationships having to do with treating each other as equals and
consent trade making a deal and you know in which as opposed to force and he was talking about human
relations and then he says but the most flex socially flexible way of achieving goals of exchange
is clearly economic through monetary transactions and that's not what she would say i mean of course
monetary transactions are a form of trade but it's not as if that's the i the best example of trade and
then from there he gets to and of course that means let's say for capitalism as if the way she gets to
let's say for capitalism is because she thinks that all human relationships have to be based on
monetary transactions that are fair she doesn't think that and she doesn't say that and while
we're at it by the way i didn't see i didn't see the capitalism book in his references now i understand
that she wrote that later but that doesn't seem to stop him in other cases and you would think that
that would be if he's going to talk about if he's going to mention capitalism he might mention capitalism the
book that capitalism thing is the same sort of foreshortening as in the copyright thing like
here's a point she makes here's a place we know she gets to uh here's a thread that would connect them
and it's not got nothing to do with how she connects them but it's not in the center of gravity is all off
it's not how she would connect them and it's a sort of rushing to an end he wants to connect it to without
doing the work and without indicating that this is you know one may you might draw them
ran does it differently when she actually sorts it out or something like that
so i've got one that was a pet peeve for me which i want to ask shoshana about because i know she knows
something about it page 177 down to the last details ran sketch for anthem is based on a science
fiction novel we secretly passed around during her leningrad student days written by her compatriot
yevgeni zamyatin in 1920 to 21. i read zamyatin back in college and the things that i know are
similar are the the russians author the author is russian the characters don't have names they have
numbers and it's a dystopian novel but that's about it and we and shoshana can you tell us more about
whether there's any evidence the other the other uh point that people mention is that it is called we
and anthem is based on the disappearance of the singular personal pronouns i i think they still
use them in the book right what the characters right right they still use i in the book uh i think that
what's true is that he he says down to the last detail and he says secretly passed around and you know
the basic impression is that of course she copied it well in fact i think a fair reading would see not
only the point is very different because um we is anti-russian but it's not anti-collectivism in the
way that anthem is it doesn't have the linguistic originality it doesn't have the same theme and the
device of a character talking in the first person that's a detail well duh you know that that's that's
not unique to dystopian fiction it's not new to fiction and it certainly doesn't show that there's
a direct connection now i have to admit i did write about this i mean i wrote about anthem and other books
that you could put in the same category and this is one in which i think that the parallels almost
highlight for you the contrasts that they're quite different uh even even including the device of
going outside the city i mean that also is fairly common if there's if there's a dangerous place
people might leave it as part of their rebellion so i don't i i've kind of looked into this because
it'd be interesting if she'd but she does mention in her interviews some books that she
some writers she knew or whose work she knew in russia she doesn't mention him and i don't think
that she would have said oh i can't talk about that because i copied him so it's a claim that's
frequently made i don't think it would be made if um people read a bunch of dystopian novels and these
were two of them you wouldn't pick these two out as saying they're like each other i i and yeah i think
that's a great point um and uh that like if you just take the scope and the genre like yeah this is
not this would not surprise you it doesn't um it's only when you have just a just you know something
about this one particular and this other particular you're inclined to make some kind of causal connection
that you wouldn't if you knew the genre more broadly um especially since samyatin's book is not
about technology having gone backwards it's about space travel you know it's a technology going
forward and so that's very different now i know it's a detail but there there was a story she read
in the saturday evening post in 1937 and it was called steven vincent benet and it's in the first
person and it's someone writing from a future that's decayed and he needs to discover so that element of it
is indeed similar to what we have in anthem but i mean it's sorry we've yeah i was just going to say
she had the idea of anthem from her childhood her teenage years in russia and the reason that there's
a there is a generic connection here in the first person narrative but she was hoping to get hers
published in the same in saturday evening post they paid well and it was a good venue and she describes
the post piece as having been an inspiration to her in the place where she talks about this in the
biographical interviews the same place where unconnected to anthem she mentions uh that there
were some interesting individualist authors being kind of circulated around right um there's no reason
why she wouldn't have said it if it had been an influence and maybe it was but it doesn't stand out
as a kind of certainly not copy but one of the tropes that you often see in critical literature on
aynrand along with the kind of psychologizing about her motives and the origin of her philosophy
is the idea that she just copied it from uh some other uh some other philosophers there this is
often an implication with her relationship to nietzsche uh and here we see another example of it and i
i mentioned that because um it's it's part of the reason i think that it's a trope is because
the critics have the idea that well here's an individualist who claims that she is a self-created
woman who's brought herself up by her bootstraps and yet she's robbing and stealing all of these
ideas from other figures so it's an attempt uh not just at a general uh diminishment but i kind of
allegation of hypocrisy but then you really better have your uh you better have the evidence for it
if you're going to make that claim as part of this that's the i the aynrand ungrateful aynrand
hypocritical and so on i have an example i don't know if it's too detailed but it really to me was
interesting and because it also ties in with what i was saying what we've been saying at the beginning
about the facts when uh when he's talking about the acquisition of the contract for the fountainhead
he writes apparently out of the blue page 296 but in fact engineered by isabel patterson the
indianapolis-based publishing house bob's merrill showed definite interest particularly from a newly
appointed editor by the name of archie ogden that's the quotation okay now he doesn't give source for
that but i think his source is has to be ann heller so i looked to see what ann heller said and ann heller
said that there were two stories of how she got the contract and one of them is that she knew richard
meeland who was her boss at paramount pictures yet she was writing the synopses for and that he made
the contact with archibald ogden etc etc and then there's this other story and the other story is
that isabel patterson bludgeoned archie ogden into taking it and the source for this other story according
to ann heller is that isabel patterson told it to mildred hall and then mildred hall told that to
ann heller it would have happened in 1941 and isabel patterson would have had to tell it to
mildred hall by 1961 because she was dead after that and then in 2000 in 2004 mildred hall is talking
to ann heller that doesn't that's not and it's not documented and the other story the competing story
is documented in public materials you don't even have to go to the bobs merrill papers which i did
where you you get more information but you don't have to go there you you you can look at public
documents and this other story there's no documentation but mildred hall said isabel patterson would
not have made it up so patterson talks to mildred hall talks to ann heller and this and ann heller
says maybe they're both true and but what he does now this isn't even scholarship this is a game of
telephone right you know all these people talking to each other what he does is he takes this story
which even ann heller doesn't see as definitive and he writes but in fact
how did it get upgraded to a fact and it's a hack a fact i'm very grateful that out that's that's a
really um that's that's really interesting and yeah and and the things i i read that and i thought okay
okay what else is he doing in his other sources where things have been upgraded to facts when it's
a game of telephone and he's gotten it from a source that didn't even say what he's saying so
anyway maybe isabel patterson did say it to mildred hall but it wasn't true
uh i think we should start to wrap up and i'm uh i'm interested just to hear if uh any of you have
any kind of closing thoughts or or comments you want to make on any of the issues we've talked about
before we wrap up there's one topic we didn't touch on that i'd like to at least briefly um
we've been talking for the most part about this book but only a little bit about the the other
women mentioned in it um but i'd like to just think what do we think of these women in particular what
do we think of all of their um attraction to flirtation with devotion to in some cases
socialism and particularly communism stalinism means they both were with for a period of basically
an apologist for stalin um so what do we what do we make of this how do we think about this or
certainly for lenin um what do we you know what do we make of this it's it's it's not unique to them
this was a a widespread intellectual trend in the middle of the 20th century but i don't think you
can if we're talking about rand and these three other women they're on opposite sides of a major
social political issue the major social political issue of the century and what are we to make of
that and how are we to evaluate it okay they actually had leon trotsky staying at her house
and one of the other things that her her parents had to put up with uh though admittedly she i think
had an argument with him on on matters of politics um yeah so we had talked about before the ways in
which rand is an outlier in various ways from these other figures she's the only one who for much of her
life is living in america for instance and thinks of herself as as an american well rent spends a long
time in america uh well at least for the period of time that we're talking about but for the period
of time we're talking about it it's important because uh why is she in america she's in america
because she's the also the only one who has lived under communism and fled from it and took refuge in america
and the i i want to emphasize this because there are places in the book where when you're going back
and forth between the different stories of the different figures you see the europeans living in
pretty grim conditions because the nazis are about to take over and then you flip back to america and
ayn rand's working on her novel in relative comfort and to me the implication the author's trying to make is
she's not having to deal with so much and that's part of what makes her humorous in his view okay but
you didn't get the picture of her life under communism in the soviet union that she fled from
and that she knows a little something about what its implications were and that's why when she writes we
the living uh it's it's it's not just a uh a fantasy novel on her part she knows how socialism and
communism destroy individuals and destroy the kinds of individuals that that all three of these other
women would have been and why they would have been destroyed under this system i mean it is a pretty
important topic he's he doesn't make enough perhaps about the fact that she did live under
this totalitarian system um and but arendt um was a jew in france after the vichy takeover
de beauvoir lived through the whole period of issue france um also uh vey's family right they flee to
america and she chooses to go back but she goes back to england so it it's a little more complicated
because they did live under kind of military occupation it's not the same thing but i don't
i don't think he's he's kind of making i think he thinks both historically it's the same dark times
and his perspective is rand sees the whole world going to um going to hell and is rightly you know
we're wrong but is concerned that america will too um so i think from that perspective he's not taking
her lightly i think he's taking that seriously as a position but um um um i i um
well part of what i'm into is doesn't it matter that we have two wretched monstrous evils spreading
politically at this time um and belatedly uh all of these people come to see some at least something
a little bit wrong with both of them but for a large part of this three of these four women are
advocates of one of these two evils i think if you're giving the biography of intellectuals and uh
intellectuals in a historical period uh when uh there's kind of monstrous evil oppression going on
where they stand on it matters and i think there's a kind of dancing around this thinking of it as sweet
that oh well of course they were idealistic so they were socialists and oh they eventually
you know not not even that long came to think that communism was bad too uh but there's not i mean these
people are cheering on pro far later than some of the others the brutality of the ussr at like rand
would not have wanted to be in the same room with these people and because of this and i think that
issue made me you know that they're on the opposite sides of this kind of great divide i think really
matters and really matters to how you judge them like can you have been honestly a supporter of stalin
uh a support you know could you have honestly had trotsky at your house and what must you be
thinking and what could individualism and life and all these things mean to you while you're you know
so i mean this the the takeaway he makes about vey when she has trotsky in puts him up in her parents
second apartment uh is look at how brave she is to argue with this big man that everybody looks uh uh
looks up to and she's daring enough to like indict the soviet union uh alongside the nazis not hey
she's putting up the commander of the red army so he can have a fourth international and he's
simultaneously defending the soviet state while he does that so you know trotsky looks kind of silly
in light of it but like but not oh god this is a horrible horrible person and you can't imagine
an episode like this with goebbels being passed over lightly right yeah yeah that's right um well
yeah um and i think that uh you know um part of the part of the problem here is in part like what work
totalitarianism does as if suddenly now socialism or suddenly now dictatorship becomes something totally
different than what it was before and that's sort of how arent sees it it's like oh you can't confuse
this dictatorship from totalitarianism and she does point out yes there are some differences but but
then they are a liking kind and um and i mean in on to in origins of totalitarianism which i read just
for this the sake of this understanding better this book um arent's uh so it has three parts the first
part is on anti-semitism the second on imperialism the third on totalitarianism and my take is you know
arent makes some good observe some interesting and insightful observations but gives very crappy
i tend to think explanations and the entire section on imperialism is basically recycled marxist views of
of imperialism like what causes it and what it's all about and surplus goods and surplus labor and
and it's just and and she thinks that the choice of different economic systems is sort of irrelevant to
political liberty but then there's some other weird organizational feature about totalitarianism that
suddenly makes it so much more monstrous and it's just it is you know i don't it's not very impressive
well it's inadequate by the way when i said he doesn't have time for this issue i didn't mean that
he gets he gets a pass because he ran out of pages but that he didn't make time for it and he should
have so i i meant that to be critical um it's interesting you just mentioned about anti-semitism
because that's unless i missed it he doesn't say anything about de beauvoir's anti-semitism yeah
yeah and he's close to it because he's quoting some passages from her war diaries her notebooks
where she makes some very unpleasant comments um about the jews and typical jewish
taking advantage and that sort of thing yeah i mean yeah it's it's right in there and it's in her own
words so it's it's there i mean in arend um in on the origins of totalitarianism makes a claim she
directly takes on the uh conceptualization of the jew that sartre had offered and says no this is wrong
that it's the it's you know you are as others sort of define you and that's what and um but what arend
does because this kind of got her in in controversy in the jewish community was she was willing to kind
of i name what scholars of jewish history serious academic ones had been identifying for the last
generation or two which is that the jewish community had been self-segregating in various ways
and that you know it's not just what they do to us we wanted to be separate and so on so um i don't
know that was another place where you could have brought any of these themes to light also that was
the view of the brand it's not really said publicly but in her uh it was definitely her view of jews
that she knew um that they were racist because they were and this was before world war ii uh because
they were cloistered and staying with one another and not not socializing um that that was something
really wrong and bad one of the things that hannah arendt one of the doctrines or ideas that hannah
arendt is i think rightly famous for uh is her idea of the banality of evil which she uses to explain
uh eichmann in jerusalem uh how is it that this this low-level bureaucrat could end up being
responsible for mass murder he's not the type you would imagine as as the mass murderer the mustache
twitch mustache twi twisting scheming uh uh ne'er-do-well he's he's a a bureaucrat who's
thoughtless who takes the orders that he's given and it's it's it's an insightful analysis of someone
like eichmann but you'd have to think what other if if if it's so easy for uh a low-level bureaucrat to
become a a killer because of his thoughtlessness what other kinds of thoughtlessness uh is there
in the world that everybody takes as ordinary everybody takes for granted that could nonetheless
be responsible for leading us to become killers and one such uh one such example that i think
escapes her notice and that escapes the notice of several of these other thinkers other than rand is
the kind of ordinary moral ideas that we all take for granted the idea that simone vey takes super
seriously when she says let me be a martyr let me be a self-sacrificer that's the idea that rand
thinks is ultimately responsible for the totalitarian regimes both fascist and socialists that they are
simply putting into practice on a large scale the kind of insanity that uh vey puts into
practice in her own life and uh it's it's a it's a banality that people take for granted that
morality consists in this kind of sacrifice but one that you shouldn't be thoughtless about uh that
you have to subject to scrutiny and that was i think one of rand's great insights i agree with most of the
criticisms made of uh of the book and yet i still see it as progress and there's something that's worth
worth reading um for for a couple of reasons so it's it's this category of popular scattershot
um impressionistic history and there's there are books like this and you know one has to know when
one's reading a book like that versus when one's reading a book of serious scholarship that it's fuzzy
it's not too accurate it's not well sourced um but you know that's the genre whether it's a respectable
genre or not um they usually don't quite come to that much but they're sometimes interesting or
thought-provoking uh we can talk about whether there should be such books but uh there are and if you
just take it for granted that this is one of those as opposed to you know high level scholarship uh or
really careful meticulous thinking um i don't think it's bad for that kind of thing i think
it's pretty good for that kind of thing uh it compares some thinkers who are interesting who it's
worth comparing it doesn't go very deep into the comparison but um but it's thought provoking by doing
it and the standard for people writing on rand outside of the people who do it really well
is really really low um if you look at philosophers who publish articles on her even ones who don't
think of themselves as taking pot shots there's no thought there's no appreciation there's no delving
into what might be of value here there's no attempt to compare them thoughtfully to other people
so much of the biography of her is um lame attempts at scandal mongering or being salacious
rather than trying to think about how the ideas develop and i think the project of putting her
in parallel with other thinkers living at the same time living through some of the same events
thinking about what she would have thought of their ideas and what they would have thought of her
ideas the attempts to to give her take on individualism versus collectivism i think are
accurate and fair-minded to the extent that someone who has this kind of a world view and is this
kind of a writer can be accurate and fair-minded it's not precise it's vague but it's not a
caricature either and she comes across as do these other four as interesting thinkers worth sorry other
three as interesting thinkers worth uh worth comparing and i think for good reason because they are and i
think he did a good enough job to bring that out despite um being slipshod in his historiography despite
um having some questionable moral views despite not being terribly deep and uh you know not every
author is going to be terribly deep i think we're better off having this book in the world than not
it's interesting it might lead people to uh see some things of value in rant who hadn't before
and it had led me to some interesting questions about uh to both war and uh aren't in particular that i i
didn't have before i knew a little bit about each of those um so i have a kind of very qualified
positive uh view of the book uh i think jason you have a more negative view but yet i think we
agree on the facts of it so that's yeah i mean i i also i like i don't ask would the world be better
with or without this book in it or let me put it this way it speaks to some good facts that he did
this book the way that he did about you know good about the reception of rand and uh i don't think
it you know it will hurt um the efforts to understand her because so many people will get the wrong
um picture or something i just um i just and i'm not that worried about the person who this is their
first entree to it and you know and then it spoils everything thereafter but i'm worried it doesn't add
value does it add value in some way and i think it does just in a modest way
i mean i i think there were some usually off base but occasion but often daring and interesting
and once in a while ring of truth um kinds of comparisons or juxtapositions of her with something
else and i mean if i discount the the value the negative valence of all the things wrong or bad
and i just count those things and i go yeah okay there are some things that i got out of it um sure
i i mean yeah but um look you know it makes me all the more eager to to wish there was not just a really
competent biography of rand uh you know i i've been working on the same book for 13 years so i have
no excuse um uh no but uh an intellectual biography right the a real biography of how her ideas change
over this critical point i think you know to really get straight when was she where with respect to nietzsche
and etc is just it's very much needed and we've been the companion you know lester hunts has written
on that and it's better than the other stuff that people have said about that but you know like we
really need and daryl wright has written about some of her early moral thought we need more of this and
we need we need the big picture it also gives you a hint of what better work on that big picture of rand
can power and what even the current work on that big picture of rand could power if you had people
taking it seriously because there's a lot of interesting things to say about well how did she
relate to other people writing at the time what are the interesting parallel if you think of particular
current events or particular episodes or issues of moment in the period when she was writing how did
her position fit with the positions of other people who were thinking about that say to both hearts or
whoever it might be and what can we learn about the the issue about each of these figures by doing
these kinds of comparisons and i think it's it's good to see that kind of work that we as rand scholars
maybe aren't in a position to do as well because we don't know all the other figures but that work
starting to get done um hopefully it'll get done better than this and hopefully it'll get done in a way
that makes better use of the really quality research that's been done on rand and hopefully even better
research that'll be done on her in the future but it's early days in uh in that kind of intellectual
work happening and i think if we think about the level of that sort of intellectual work with any
figure in the culture how well aristotle is treated or leonardo da vinci or you know whoever it might be
um it's never done that well i mean so the the standard i mean it is occasionally but the standards by
which we're judging this book i don't think it's um conspicuously bad by the standards of books that do this
kind of thing i think it's probably middling by the standards of books i try to do this kind of
i want to thank you both i thank you all uh for having this conversation and uh look forward to
having more of them with you about other books that that uh that do or don't relate to ayn rand
we'll be we'll be i think talking about a variety of them on multiple subjects in this series so thanks for
thank you for joining me and uh good night to our audience
you
