40 percent 45 percent of the american people believe literally in adam and eve believe
literally that the world is only 6 000 years old i mean that's a shocking figure and you can't duck
out of it imagine being able to decipher the history of every creature ever to have lived on
earth based on its evolution why are men's sect drives so powerful why does this peculiar desert
lizard have such intricate patterns on its back and what does it tell you about its long dead
relatives today we have the extraordinary privilege of exploring these topics and more with one of our
greatest living treasures richard dawkins one of the world's most influential and thought-provoking
scientists genes are predicting the future because they will not survive unless they get the prediction
right richard is a renowned evolutionary biologist zoologist and author a prominent figure in the new
atheism along the other so-called horsemen of the apocalypse past guest sam harris and the late
great daniel dennett he's well-known criticism of creationism and intelligent design you can't opt
out of science because it goes against a traditional faith in our widely ranging conversation we explore
the evolution of sex drive and the aesthetic appreciation of genetics as well as the way
genetics intersect in theoretical and experimental science we talk about the potential evolutionary
outcomes of artificial intelligence as it augments humanity we talk about what it's like to be a
scientist and a scholar with a career ranging over 50 years and we encounter along our journey some of
the greatest figures in all of science i know you're gonna love this episode so let's go richard i've always
wanted to ask you why is the sex drive in men so strong i mean surely we could have gone through the
replication of the species if it were 10 less powerful maybe even 25 less powerful i mean what accounts
for the behavior in men such that they will copulate with female angler fishes in ways that allow them to
be digested or ingested into their female target or say a male human being who buys a
social media app when he already has a quarter trillion dollars and 11 or 12 children what is
make what is the reason the biological necessity that the male sex drive is as strong as it is
i think perhaps you're misled when you say something like replicate the species it's not about replicating
the species it's about replicating genes and genes that are in males have a different way of getting
themselves into the next generation than genes that are in females and because sperms are so numerous
and eggs are rather few in number eggs are economically valuable well endowed with food sperms are not and
therefore they can afford to be much more numerous what this means is that in general throughout the animal
kingdom males can pass on their genes by mating with lots of females whereas with a female mating with
lots of males doesn't benefit her because once she's been in a mammal pregnant let's say talk about mammals
there's no benefit in mating with another male whereas in the male's case once he's mated with a female
there is some benefit in mating with another one because you've got lots of sperms to go around
and therefore the male sex drive is when there's any difference between them the male sex drive does
tend to be stronger males tend to be more promiscuous tend to be more open to mating with lots of different
females males tend to be less fussy about who they mate with etc so that's i think the answer it's about
gene replication not species replication and if it were diminished by a few percent would that affect
the relative fecundity of uh replication of genes or is is that level that we have it at as males does
that seem to be a necessity or could it be diminished a bit it varies from species to species i mean not
not not all species are promiscuous in in the males there are there are many species in which
the sexes contribute equally to reproducing and to to nurturing the young and that's different i mean
different species differ according to their ecological circumstances so you're talking
about diminishing yes it does happen it happens in in some species monogamous species it is diminished
yes we in in physics and especially our friend sir roger have have looked at the possibility of the
destruction of information what's called the the information paradox of black holes where there's
actually pretty vehement disagreement between scientists on whether or not information is
truly conserved or can it be destroyed and um and hawking radiation plays a significant role in that
can genetic information be destroyed richard is is there a sense in the same way that are you know
at some level you cannot destroy genes any more than you can destroy information even when you throw it
into a black hole i think it's less philosophically interesting than in the case of the of the physics
you're talking about the information in dna is preserved in living organisms over millions of years but
if you want to actually look at the dna itself ancient dna uh people who for example uh dig up um
neanderthal people and um look at their their dna that decays so there's no there's no almost certainly
no hope of jurassic park of actually getting dinosaur dna um it it decays you you you're talking
about 10 10 000 years 100 maybe 100 000 years but not millions of years so yes it it does decay some
have suggested that you know dna is is sort of the uh the the the nucleator the or the originator of life
in some sense and i do want to mention talk to you about that i'm here at uc san diego rich where
jeffrey and margaret burbage uh the late great burbage uh duo used to work and they would bring
quite frequently fred hoyle who as you know is a proponent of panspermia which i always remind my
listeners if you're young it sounds dirty but it's not a dirty word um the notion of origin of life is is
is obviously a question i always point out it's not exactly related to to life itself right i mean
i can study cosmology the evolution of the universe without knowing exactly how it came about in fact
we don't know how it came about exactly um can you say something about origin of life is that is that is
that possible to divine or to read the genetica book of the dead and learn about the origin of life
itself or is it merely not merely it's a huge topic obviously but is the genetic book of that
are the encryptions and encoding in the carving of natural selection does that not have the ability to
penetrate the firewall of the origin of life itself there has to have been originally a self-replicating
entity like dna that has to have been the start once you've got a self-replicating entity then you have
the capacity for darwinian evolution to get going but it cannot have been dna dna is what's been called
a high-tech replicator um it needs a sophisticated infrastructure of cellular machinery to to copy
itself and so that wouldn't have been available so there has to have been a forerunner a kind of john
the baptist molecule um a forerunner which um was capable of replicating without sophisticated
copying machinery it's may not ever be possible to definitively prove one or the other the currently
most favored theory probably is it was rna which as you know is related to dna but is a bit different
the reason why dna can't be the origin is that it requires enzymes catalysts in order to replicate
the uh catalyst the enzymes that it requires are proteins and proteins require dna so we've got a
catch-22 rna is a moderately good replicator and a moderately good enzyme dna is a superb replicator
and and is not an enzyme at all protein is a superb enzyme is not a replicator at all
so protein and and dna um are are great partners but neither of them can do the job that the other
one can do rna can do both so rna in a rudimentary kind of way can act as a catalyst and it can even
catalyze its own replication so the rna so-called rna world theory is is a good candidate for something
like what must have gone on the origin of life i think all i would be prepared to say is that the
origin of life must have been the origin of a self-replicating molecule self-replicating without
the need for sophisticated machinery and therefore without the catch-22 i suppose we know roughly
when it was i mean it did since the earth itself is is what four and a half billion years old and the
first uh fossils are three point three point eight or so billion years old so somewhere between those
two dates uh must have been when when it happened you mentioned fred holland panspermia i i i wouldn't
rule out panspermia but i don't i would rule out fred holl's reason for wanting it i mean fred holl thought
it was too improbable to have arisen on earth and therefore you needed to have panspermia francis
crick and leslie orgle also in san diego played around with the idea of directed panspermia um the
the idea that actually it was life on earth was seeded by um an intelligent life form elsewhere in
the universe i think they were tongue-in-cheek i don't think they really believed it but it was an
interesting idea to sort of toy with yeah i had thomas check um winner of the nobel prize uh for
the catalytic properties of rna on and he and i definitely came to the agreement that rna is much
more interesting and and useful uh he was almost a trash-talking dna but uh nobel prize winners or or want
to do that i i guess the the argument i've always made i'd love to run this by you if you'll indulge
me uh for a moment but when we look at mars mars is is fairly similar to earth in size it's not too
it's smaller but it's not it's not microscopic in comparison it's in the so-called goldilogue zone of
the earth it has exchanged materials with the earth for literally billions of years i actually have
a fragment of mars here oh wonderful i would give you if you're in person yeah and i give out other op i
give out meteorites to my uh listeners who who are uh listening and enjoying the show but um but i
point out that you know i have a mars meteorite which means that mars has a lot of earth meteorites
on it and probably a lot more and some of those could have carried genetic material but the fact
that we don't see life on mars and yes we haven't explored every square you know millimeter of it uh to
know that but it seems pretty probable that at least the surface of mars is uh is not inhabited
by macroscopic uh life forms can that be seen as sort of a uh an estimate or be used to estimate in a
in a bayesian sense how hard it is for a light we always hear about how easy life is to start yes as
you just said once it got kicked off but can we use just the other data point we have so few data points
and and we have no obvious data that suggests life is abundant in the universe other than the
probability that it could be so but that's not an argument so what would you make of these of an
argument that we haven't discovered life with all these technology it's actually maybe there it's a
lot harder to get started than we naively might have thought if we found life on mars or enceladus or
anywhere in the in the solar system then you do your bayesian statistics and you immediately say right
that means life is the universe is crawling with life i mean it's it's it's immediately it's a huge
data point um to change the the estimate of the likelihood of life being elsewhere provided um
it's it's a separate life form i mean you'd have to look at its genetic system if it uses dna especially
if it uses the same genetic code then uh it would then it's it's been transferred by a meteorite
going either from earth to mars or from mars to earth a key question would be to look at its genetic
code and say first is it dna second does it have the same genetic code if it has the same genetic code
it's far too improbable that that would arise spontaneously uh twice over that what that that
must mean contamination if it has a different genetic code and i stick my neck out and say there
must be a genetic code of some sort and i think i'd stick it so far as to say it must be
digital but it doesn't necessarily have to be quaternary it doesn't have to be binary it could
be could be octal i mean there are various other possibilities um but if it's different then
immediately we know that um life is common rather than rare now what's the chance i mean could it be
that we are literally unique could it be that we are the only life form in the universe well i think
yes i mean it we don't we can't disprove that if you want to believe that we're the only life form
in the universe then that immediately commits you to the belief that the origin of life on this planet
was a quite stupendously improbable event because the sheer number of available planets in which life
could have started is so huge that means that when we think about theories for the origin of life we are
not looking for a plausible theory we're looking for a highly implausible theory because if there's
a plausible theory then the universe has got to have a lot of a lot of life forms we don't know
but but if you if you're the kind of person who's who thinks that we are unique in the universe then
be aware that you are committed therefore to the belief that the origin of life on this planet
is so implausible is so improbable that any theory that a chemist comes up with has got to be
vanishingly implausible and that's an interesting kind of paradoxical result scientific advances are
often frightening as well as exciting an example of this is elon musk's new neural link a brain computer
interface designed to assist paralyzed patients in controlling technology with their thoughts
while this technology holds immense promise for restoring movement and communication
ethical concerns linger around safety privacy and the potential long-term effects despite the
controversy neural link is planning upcoming trials in more and more patients aiming for high
single digits by the end of the year if successful this could mark a significant step towards
revolutionizing human computer interaction i love staying up to date on news especially related to
science technology and artificial intelligence and with the rapid speed of today's news cycle
it's crucial to stay informed and trust where you're getting your information i'm excited i found
this story about neural link on ground news ground news is a website and app that i use every day
it gathers articles from around 50 000 news sources all over the world in an unbiased way that can help you
read between the lines of the standard mainstream media bias it helps you break free of algorithms
and echo chambers and filter bubbles you can check them out at ground dot news slash dr brian let me show
you why i love ground news right away in the neural link story you can see that 47 news outlets have
reported on the story of these 47 outlets 35 of them lean to the left politically 35 come from the center
and only 31 lean right you can see the reliability of the outlets covering the story this is unique
it also shows who owns the outlets reporting on the story the majority 32 are from independent news
outlets ground news also makes it easy to compare headlines to see how bias might influence the framing
and shape our understanding of the issues i found it hugely fascinating that the left tends to focus on
the detailed technical issues and improvements highlighting the long-term goals while the center emphasizes
musk's intentions to give people superpowers surprisingly the right leaning media coverage
underscores assurances made that the implant doesn't harm the brain and focuses more on the
technology's potential benefits you can't get this type of news analysis anywhere else the news isn't
going to report on itself but ground news does with ground news you get a deeper understanding of the
complexity and nuance of different issues by seeing it from all different sides and identifying media
narratives to get this go to ground.news dr bryant dr bryant to stay fully informed on breaking news

an independent platform for news and supporting the show as well last week i spoke uh with a neighbor
of yours george f statiu who's at cambridge university i guess you guys aren't neighbors but
uh well he was at oxford that's right yes he is an eminent uh cosmo yeah we've poached uh we've poached
him for one of our as an advisor for our observatory in chile but he quoted something that startled me
and and it was a quote from francis crick who you mentioned earlier this is george summarizing what
francis crick said and then i want your reaction so this is very many meta layers richard i hope you'll
indulge me okay francis said yeah francis said that if your theory agrees with all the data it's
bound to be wrong how do you react to that uh are there are there theories that are too good that
seems to be typically sort of provocative um i mean you you could say it's it's it's it's it's a
it's a useless theory or something like that but it's not bound to be wrong i mean
that that that that can't be right i think he was just being provocative yeah that would not surprise
me although not as provocative as jim watson right i want to talk about um uh artificial intelligence
and and and so forth but before i do i'd like you to if you're willing to indulge me in another one of
my abba questions where i ask you to to not say sing dancing queen but it's impossible for me richard to
not ask you about to define a meme would you would you please uh for the benefit of of my audience
uh who may not know can you explain meme and my question is if there are gene pools are there also
meme pools so first could you start with a meme what is a meme and are there meme pools yes a meme is
a unit of cultural inheritance i was interested in the last chapter of the selfish gene the first edition
of the selfish gene and the whole book has been about the gene as the unit of selection and and
and darwinian selection is the differential survival of genes in gene pools and i wanted to make the
point that there's nothing magic about dna anything self-replicating can potentially be a unit of natural
selection and um a computer virus for example would would have been a good example if i'd known about
computer viruses then um but uh what i did know about was human culture not much about it but but
it was clear to me that certain aspects of human culture could behave as replicators because they
get imitated so something like clothes fashions or tunes yes and habits of speech uh things like that
anything that gets copied around the meme pool with the meme pool being the set of humans which imitate
in a position to imitate each each other so something like the one example i use is that is the reverse
baseball cap um which which spread as an epidemic um of memes because people think it looks cool and they
so they turn their cap backwards and and that so that the act of imitation is analogous to dna
replication but it's mimetic replication not not dna replication um
the more i mean it's quite clear that memes exist in that sense what's not clear is whether they
really are subject to darwinian selection i think they have to be in some sense there are certain things
well i i said the the backwards baseball cap is cool cool means in this case it has good survival
value it's it's equivalent to it to a gene which is good at surviving in the gene pool so something
like that or a catchy tune that when you hear somebody whistling it or singing it it infects your
mind and you find yourself whistling or singing it yourself and that infects somebody else so that is a
catchy uh meme something like a craze at school you know when you when we were at school there
would be a craze for a particular toy or particular game a particular way of doing things
um a particular word a a private word that that people in the school use and and is not used outside
the school i think many schools have such such words these are all memes which um which if they
spread successfully have high that by definition they therefore have such has high survival value
that is a kind of darwinian selection what's more problematic is whether that can give rise to
interesting evolution um and there i think we come to the idea of the meme complex something like a
a collection of memes which go well together which cooperate well together rather like i was talking
earlier about the genes cooperating with each other because they have the same
exit route um well a cooperative of memes might be something like the roman catholic church where
a whole lot of different uh replicating ideas survive in each other's presence
and therefore uh could be regarded as a meme complex or memeplex and um you perhaps can think of
other examples of possible memeplexes i've talked a lot uh this past year to friends of yours sam harris
um i actually was honored to give the uh do the last final interview with uh daniel dennett before
he passed away oh right earlier this year and i've also spoke you know with uh donald hoffman uh it's
been a year of talking to a lot of eminent uh thinkers on on natural selection evolution but also
consciousness free will etc what what are your recollections of dan dennett um now that uh he's
to part of this mortal coil we miss him so much um you have any favorite stories of interactions with
daniel oh well a great bear of a man and genial jovial very kind but also strong and didn't suffer fools
gladly but um if anybody was sincerely interested in learning he was he was up for it i miss him
enormously i mean not just as a friend but as a as an intellectual um go-to person really i mean i would
i would um he's so intelligent and so um good at talking about anything uh you know there are some
people who when you talk to them sort of feel they raise your game and i would say that he doubt he did
that uh he he not only was a highly intelligent converser himself but he he he raised what what
what intelligence one has oneself um to a higher plane by just being there and um i i i admired him
enormously and and uh miss him hugely yeah one of the things that spoke to me so loudly yeah
we he was such a mensch you could ask him anything but yes he would he would harumph away you know the uh
the the foolish questions but he was he was always a gentleman and uh he he just had such a good cheer
and and i regret that i only had a chance to talk to him or just before he passed away uh because you
could literally fill an entire podcast with him um i wonder if you've encountered in your work richard or
just in your natural intellectual parapetism and being so curious about ideas from other fields
that that kind of enter in to the role of natural selection i'm thinking about two two people in
particular uh donald hoffman who's got this perception-based reality uh concept and lee small
and both past guests on the podcast who talk about black holes as as uh nucleating what he calls cosmic
darwinian evolution what do you make of these uh sort of concepts where are they legitimate
you know venues to pursue are they mainly you know kind of trying to hitch their wagon to the star
that is natural selection the brilliant idea that is perhaps you know the most foundational idea in all
of science as a darwinian i very much like uh i mean i i warm to the kind of smolin um idea whether
it's plausible i think that's for a physicist to answer to me what i like about it is that is that
it it does the same job in cosmology as as um natural selection darwin natural selection does in in life
um in so far as um people sometimes point to the fine tuning of the universe the the idea that the
physical constants are fine-tuned in such a way that if they were if any one of them was different
life wouldn't be here uh or perhaps galaxies wouldn't be here stars wouldn't be here chemistry
wouldn't wouldn't be here it's a challenge to think well how did this fine tuning come about and
uh talking about a multiverse is obviously one way to do it and if if we have a very large number of
universes all with different physical constants then by the anthropic principle we happen we have
to be in one of the minority of universes that happens to have uh physical constants which give
rise to stars and chemistry and and life the smolin spin on that refinement of that helps because
instead of just saying we've got billions of universes and some of them just happen to be
conducive to producing the world as we as we see it and live in it because he postulates a kind of
darwinian selection of universes and the qualities that make for fecundity that make for reproductive
success of a universe good at making baby universes those very same qualities are the other qualities that
eventually uh make for um chemistry and and life but that's got to be an appealing idea to any darwinian
but when i talk to physicists about it some of them say it's rubbish and some of them say it's a nice
idea sorry for this brief interruption and this wonderful conversation with richard i just want
to let you know that to get these great guests like richard and many many others their time is so
limited they often look to see how many subscribers i have to this channel on youtube and the audio feed
and i'm sorry to say it but i understand it they want to make use of their time they don't have infinite
amount of time none of us do so you can really help me out and this will help you out to get even more
of the great guests like of richard's caliber to come on the into the impossible podcast and that's
to just subscribe and maybe if you're charitable leave a comment leave a thumbs up or a review on
your favorite podcast player it really helps us grow the podcast get great guests and break through
the noise of the five million other podcasts that these folks often get invited to this will really
help me out so just take the time while it's in your mind just push that button and you'll be doing
me a tremendous favor thanks so much now back to the episode you're right it is it is somewhat
controversial as is the multiverse i i know you were uh very uh very generous with your encomium for
our mutual friend lawrence krauss and his book um a universe from nothing uh i think you did call it
you know comparable to the origin of species uh which which a lot of a lot of uh you know cosmologists
were were uh quite startled to hear because the multiverse is really right now it's a consequence
of an un unproven theory and and actually more viewed as a paradigm rather than a true elevated
to the true level of it i thought it was a consequence of inflation yes no that's absolutely
correct but inflation itself in fact my my my research is to build experimental apparatuses that can
look for the imprimatur of inflation which are gravitational waves but primordial gravitational
waves not from black holes that ligo and other instruments have detected relatively recently but
from the origin of the universe the quantum field that causes the nucleation of uh of our universe and
then can potentially spawn other universes but there's no necessarily physical evidence for that or uh
or else i wouldn't be building the you know 100 million dollar simons observatory with my colleagues and
friends so we we don't know it may it is consistent inflation is consistent but that's not quite enough
to rise to the level of of you know in my opinion and i've told this to lawrence you know comparison
with the great uh charles darwin if we did have access to you know truly artificially intelligent agents
that are human level agi as uh my past guest your neighbor there nick bostrom asserts more than that
it will lead to a form of utopia um i'm less sanguine and i'm i'm concerned about these agents as you
know i think jeremy bentham said you know not whether they can you know are they human but can they
experience pain will we have obligations to ai agents if they achieve you know the turing test or
that the the keating test or the dawkins test whatever we want to formulate once they pass some
critical threshold that people ignore will they have rights will they will we ask if they suffer
too well earlier you said um just sort of knock out a capacitor to make them feel pain it only if we've
only if the programming has built in something equivalent to to real pain i suppose but yes if
that would that were the case then i think they probably would have rights talking about artificial
intelligence it makes me think of the threats and opportunities to what you and i do which i
sometimes call the second oldest profession uh maybe the third oldest profession depending on who's
counting but being professors it's a core part of your identity and it is for my me as well what
threats or opportunities are are you seeing come about thanks to perhaps artificial intelligence
that may or may not threaten what we do because it hasn't changed much in a thousand years since
the university of bologna opened and there was a there was a guy scratching with a piece of rock
on another rock and sitting in front of rapt attention the only thing i point out richard is that
back then as you know the students could go on strike and that was barbaric because then the
professors wouldn't get paid and so thank god we have tenure now but how is your job and my how has it
changed is it gotten is it has it gotten better more enjoyable less enjoyable and what do you see as
the future threats to what we do for a living well if you're asking could could our job as professors
be taken over by by an intelligent ai i think yes i i don't see why not whether they'd be better at it
uh certainly better at it than some of one's colleagues um um but but i suppose since we are human
we empathize with a human who's lecturing if he's a really good lecturer then then somehow um the fact
that he or she is human and is gesturing and seems to be sort of seizing ideas out of the air and
passing them on and and thinking aloud um it might be harder to simulate that in an artificial
environment than simply to simulate in the imparting of knowledge the imparting of knowledge is
is certainly this kind of thing that can be done is already done actually it doesn't have to be an
intelligent professor it can just be a be a i mean google is a is a is a or wikipedia is a teacher
if you if you use it right i think got a long way to go before before you can simulate a really great
lecturer who really does inspire students but i expect that could happen as well and now pivoting uh to
another one of these abba questions you know you're not gonna sing dancing queen i wonder if you could
recapitulate the concept of the shifting moral zeitgeist and then i want to apply it to what's
come about on campuses i date it you know for about 10 years now something has changed it's palpable on
campus uh speakers you know will be protested shut down there'll be violent threats against
administrators i just testified to the u.s congress uh two weeks ago about my experiences with
anti-semitism i'm a jew and my experiences and my students experiences here at the university of
california i wonder first could you define the shifting moral zeitgeist and then could we
explain and perhaps segue how it is as a subset affecting campus culture again where you and i do our work
yes i i think if you if you think about um going back a few centuries going back decades actually
you don't need to go back centuries um you'll find a completely well gradually shifting moral
positions um if you look at say um uh just trivial crime fiction detective stories agatha christie uh bulldog
drummond james bond um uh agatha christie i think 1920s 1930s perhaps um you'll find rather shocking
anti-semitism uh racial prejudice of various sorts anti-women prejudice and which would have been
normal and uh expected if you go back further to say the middle of the 19th century
and look at say um somebody like abraham lincoln or thomas henry huxley both of whom were
in the vanguard of advanced liberal thought at the top of their own time yet they were by modern
standards flagrant racists i mean both lincoln and huxley took it for granted that that black people were
inferior to white and were incapable of having the same reasoning processes um women didn't get the
vote in various countries until uh the 20th century in switzerland until that rather late in the 20th
century uh in america i think in the 1920s in britain in the 1920s the assumption was that women
were incapable of exercising proper judgment and so they couldn't be trusted with the vote i mean
you it's palpable manifest that the the moral zeitgeist shifts as the decades go by as to why
it shifts i think that's an interesting and complex question it's it's uh it it's a sort of quasi
evolutionary process it changes gradually and what changes it i'm not really sure i i think it's a
combination of one says sort of it's in the air when it's it's dinner table conversation it's it's
politician speeches it's it's legal decisions it's it's it's um journalistic articles it's books all
these things conspire together to to move on uh the um the moral zeitgeist um so i i think it's a
it's an empirically observable phenomenon uh and a very important one you go back to medieval times and
you get truly appalling things i mean public executions for entertainment people with the
idea of a good of a good day out to entertain the children would be to go to public hanging
inconceivable nowadays um but routine and normal uh in medieval times in roman times gladiatorial contests
um people getting entertainment in the coliseum from from watching uh prisoners being mauled by
lions and bears and and i mean the shifting moral zeitgeist is is an empirically observable phenomenon
pivot to a different uh question for you uh let's say you open your email today and you get an email
from a friend it says richard i am very poorly today and very stupid and i hate everybody and everything
one lives only to make blunders i'm gonna write a little book for murray on orchids today i hate them
worse than anything so farewell and in a sweet frame of mine i am forever yours what would you say to a
colleague if you opened your email one day and got such a message i didn't understand that um
what are you getting at there sorry this is from this is a quote from charles darwin uh that he
apparently uh wrote to um looking up who he wrote this to he said it's it's a quote where he was depressed
from 1861 uh he wrote i am very poorly today and very stupid and i hate everybody and everything
one lives only to make blunders i'm going to write a little book for murray on orchids and today i hate
them worse than everything um so fascinating i'd never come across that yeah i never come across that
i'll i'll send it to you yeah murray was his publisher uh he did write a book about orchids
um and um i i don't think i've been quite that depressed but but but i'm interested to he that's
that's a genuine letter is it i mean i i i have a picture of his handwriting i'll i'll i'll email it
yeah i'll i post it on twitter okay that's very interesting yeah the comment is if you had a colleague
and you got such a not you but if you got a colleague like that um someone who's doing work
it's it's very tedious to do to do science as you know and i wonder if part of the tedium and
boredom and and just the the committee work and and the stuff that is not so great about what you
and i do if if you find great satisfaction from your public facing side your writing your popular
writing um where does it rank how do you compare your research life and writing you know uh papers and
and you're extremely highly cited um to writing books to communicating with the public is it a tonic
is it something that buoys you to be with the public to go on tour as you are going how do you
balance the public life with the uh with the academic life and synthesize them into one coherent
intellectual whole yes well first of all before we leave we leave darwin your your quote begins by
i'm very poorly today and darwin was of course a chronic invalid and so um he he had an illness a
mysterious illness nobody quite knows what it was but he was permanently more or less permanently ill
and so on a bad day i could well imagine that he would be hating everybody and hating life and and
and things i mean just just simply something like being being seasick you you sort of want to die i mean
if darwin felt like that i could understand him anyway but going back to your question about um
balancing talking to the writing for the public and writing for um for scientific colleagues
i try to do both um i think insofar as it's possible and i think it probably isn't possible
in physics or as much harder in physics to to to write for colleagues and for the general public in
at the same time because physics is so difficult um modern physics is so difficult both both
cosmology and quantum physics are so difficult that it's is that you you couldn't really imagine
papers to nature being written in in a way that could be understood by any lay person uh i think my
field is because i've concentrated on evolution it is possible to write in a way that is understandable by
the intelligent lay person and at the same time makes a contribution to the field my late colleague
john maynard smith when reviewing two of my books the selfish gene and the extended phenotype said that
both books were unusual in his in his opinion in that they they attempted to talk to both audiences
at the same time he said that um david lack the ornithologist david lack was another example of
somebody who did that but but but it was rather unusual that that is what i try to do not sure
how successfully but i i do i do try to make contributions at the same time as as talking to to lay
people i sometimes joke that we have almost a moral obligation as scientists who get paid by the
public after all um here in the us and there in the uk to explain things and and if you were to work as a plumber or you know
installing um stone countertops and your your employee employer said to you well what are you doing
today richard and he said i i i can't explain it to you you can't possibly understand what i'm doing
i mean you probably get fired pretty quickly and yet we have a whole host of people uh i've had this
kind of online battle with sabina hassenfelder you know about the fact that all scientists should
receive at least some training in communication to the public and yet it's almost looked down upon i mean you
you you surely know of the travails that carl sagan had in the us and never being elected to
the national academy um some say out of spite for his popularity and and we have many examples of
that oh you you know a real scientist is in the lab or at the computer um and and not communicating
with the public how do you react to my statement that scientists who are paid by the public have a
moral obligation to give some return on investment to the public who pays their salary i think there
was a time when the national science foundation when giving a grant demanded that a certain
percentage of the output of the grantee uh should be devoted to explaining to the public um what the
research was all about i'm not sure if that's still the case but i think that's a very good idea
you mentioned the carl sagan effect and uh it's notorious of course that that um he obviously should
have been a member of the national academy and wasn't i've been sometimes asked whether whether
i suffer from the same thing um i actually have been elected to the royal society despite the fact
that i most of my books are aimed at the general public um so i i haven't suffered from the sagan
effect i'm happy to say yeah i mean i i think that that communication to the public should not just
be left to professional journalists who who who do a good job of actually reading up the science and
then translating it into lay terms i think the scientists themselves ought to do it themselves and
ideally even make contributions to their science in language which is generally understandable darwin
wrote for the general public and was at the same time making a stupendous contribution to
to science and and that's a model which we might well follow this is an out of this world conversation
isn't it and if you're interested in getting a fragment of our early solar system something that's
truly out of this world i know you're going to want to go to my monday magic mailing list and you
can subscribe at briankeating.com list and if you have a dot edu email address you're guaranteed to
win one of these beauties a real fragment of our early solar system who knows perhaps
some of the schmutz was on this very meteorite that brought life to earth some billions of
years ago i don't know about that but i'll teach you all about meteorites and how to observe meteor
showers in a follow-up message once you join my monday magic mailing list and if you have a dot edu
email address you're guaranteed to win one of these beauties if you live in the united states go to
briankeating.com edu if you're a fellow academic like me and richard now back to the episode absolutely
yeah and the the people that we look to most of all at least in physics richard fineman
you know nowadays we we have uh no no real peer of his but sir roger penrose your colleague
as well these these are exceptional writers as well as scientists i mean you really can't do
climb higher um i have a question from a listener who asked uh thomas pain is his name
is evolution not being taught in america at the k through 12 level is that still a problem affecting
society um and how would you change the educational system in america or maybe even in the uk if you
could and what is sort of the best educational system right now i don't know what k through 12
means um what what is that this person's asking everything from a five-year-old up to a 17 year
old but um let's just restrict it to 14 to 17 year olds say well i think it's a pity that uh if you
look at textbooks of biology uh commonly evolution comes rather near the end of the textbook and that
doesn't make any sense because you're learning all about the facts of biology without being taught why
um and and um it really should be the first chapter because because otherwise nothing nothing makes sense
um so that would be one change would be to put it early in the curriculum rather than late um
another thing would be to um to teach it unashamedly and without intimidation from religious
fundamentalist interests who try to stop you doing so i mean some of my colleagues uh feel the need to
bowdlerize their teaching so as not to give offense to religious fundamentalists and so instead of
talking about evolution they'll talk about i don't know modification by descent or or you use a euphemism
um i think we need to confront it head on and say this this is this is science and and um you've got to
learn the science and uh you can't opt out of science because it goes against a traditional faith
would you advocate you know dialogue with uh you know trying to teach say the concept of religion as
part of an extended phenotype is is that something that you would expect would curry favor with proponents
of intelligent design or in your opinion should they be ignored it would it wouldn't curry favor um that
they i think they'd hate it one of the things that um dan dennett's book breaking the spell does is
try to explain um why people believe in evolution or sorry why people believe in religion um and uh
i i differ from many of my colleagues who who go bend over backwards to say evolution and religion
are totally compatible you don't have to give up your your faith and you can see why they do it it's
politically very sound because because otherwise you're going to just turn people away but i i'm too
much wedded to the actual truth to to to do that and so i i would be a very bad teacher in evil in in
in america probably because i would i would have people walking out of my classes rather than trying
to seduce them i've been accused of of of sort of just sort of setting it out there and not and not
it not engaging in a in an exercise of persuasion or seduction um and i i just believe in just
telling it like it is i was once talking to one of the one of the lawyers in the that famous case
kitzmiller case in in i think somewhere in pennsylvania after talking to me he said well thank
goodness we didn't call you as an expert witness you'd have lost the case for us but because i mean what
they did was that was they got religious scientists to come along and and explain that that that they're
fully compatible so i want to conclude with a set of questions that i um have basically stolen from
the late greats or arthur c clark and that is because i am here at uc san diego we're honored to
have the arthur c clark center for human imagination and the uh the center was endowed by his uh by his
uh this charitable foundation and i'm honored to be the associate uh co-director of it so i i have
all sorts of of different questions that might mainly relate to different sayings as you know sir
arthur was quite quotable and he said things uh like for every expert there's an equal and opposite
expert but i want to start with the first one uh that is probably very familiar to to you and my
audience and that's his famous quote any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
you've surely heard that richard right yes so i want to ask you what what form of technology
or invention of the human mind is most magical if you could go back to uh the time of uh say elizabeth
first um in a boeing 747 and uh get out your smartphone um and uh i mean indistinguishable from magic
obviously i mean it would be it would be uh just mind-blowing for them and i suppose if people from
500 years ahead would time travel back to us now we would be so overawed uh that we might
fall on our knees and worship them as gods because they would be they would have godlike powers i think
clark's third law is very wise and obviously true another question that is somewhat related to that and
we we touched upon it comes from 2001 a space odyssey where there are these monoliths that
appear on the african savannah and then later on in space and there are hominids that you know hitting
it with uh with bones and so forth but we don't really know what they are they could be time capsules
they could be you know other other types of phenomena i want to ask you if you had a time capsule and it
could last a billion years uh what would you put on it or in it it doesn't have to be your work it
could be or it could be you know a bach you know cantata or something like that what what would you put
in order to you know time travel uh throughout all of eternity perhaps send it out into space uh as
as a as a sort of cosmic tombstone um for humanity because we're going to be destroyed obviously
eventually um and it would be nice to think that something of our culture would be at least
slight possibility of being discovered by other civilizations so we wouldn't be totally forgotten
well i would put bach beethoven mozart schubert um and in hope that if they didn't have ears at least
they could appreciate them in some mathematical form shakespeare well the problem is language i suppose
but again they'll be very advanced so maybe they can decode the language and as for science well
uh newton uh galileo uh einstein darwin watson and crick there's so much that that that we would wish to
to preserve to advertise ourselves um i suppose lots of i suppose various different languages i like to
think of a cosmic tombstone yeah i asked uh that question to uh this is a finger puppet of carl sagan
we we have to get a uh richard dawkins uh finger puppet i i do have a noam chomsky one and he was
a guest on the show so i i think we can get uh dawkins one if there's not already but richard i asked
this of carl sagan's widow i never got to meet carl but i i asked his widow and drew in the same
question i just asked you about putting a uh basically a time capsule out in the cosmos and
she said oh i did that and i said oh really she said yeah when they were launching uh voyager 2
carl and i just started dating and he uh he put my uh put me in a eeg scanner and scanned my brainwaves
as we were just falling in love and that was put on the voyager golden disc so uh she was told by nasa
that that will last at least four billion years so um she was the first person that actually did
embody that question okay the second penultimate question richard then i'll let you go i know it's
getting late and i i just am so appreciative for your forbearance and indulgence of these of these silly
little questions but a question that uh that sir arthur asked or statement that he made was the
following he said when a distinguished but elderly scientist says something is possible they are
almost certainly right but when they say something's impossible they're probably wrong
and arthur c clark called these failures of imagination in his book profiles of the future
nowadays we call them limiting beliefs but i want to ask you the question in in the form of in this way
what have you been wrong about what have you changed your mind about if anything well i have but
it's sort of too small in a way to to uh i mean i i can give you give you one example but first
you know there's some wonderful ones of um i think it was lord kelvin in the 19th century who said that
um flying machines are impossible um maybe it wasn't lord kelvin maybe he said radio will turn out to be a
hoax uh the various 19th century eminent physicists who who got egg all over their faces by by denying the
possibility of things which are now absolutely uh commonplace um but anyway you asked me about
it was kelvin kelvin yeah yes kelvin who said uh heavier than air flying machines are impossible
that's right it was in 1895 eight years before the wright brothers proved them yes yes that's right
very good there are quite a few of those which are well worth quoting as as a cautionary tale
i was wrong about the so-called handicap principle of animal communication particular sexual selection
the idea of the israeli scientist uh amat sahavi that the reason why sexually selected um signals like
peacock's tails are so extravagant and beautiful and and wasteful
is precisely because they're extravagantly wasteful and costly and handicaps that's why they work
that's why they are favored by natural selection always before and and i went along with this i thought
i admitted that they were handicaps but i thought that they were
they survived despite being handicaps so harvey's revolutionary thought was that they survived because
they're handicaps because they're costly and only by being costly do they establish their credentials
with whoever they're trying to impress which might be a female and uh i was wrong about that and and and
this was proved by my ex-student and now colleague and now actually mentor alan graffen who who'd done
mathematical modeling to show that harvey's handicap principle really does work and costly signals really
are favored precisely because they are costly and if they were not costly they would not be favored
so i was wrong and i had to climb down hey there's a good chance you might be a scientist or an engineer
aspiring to be maybe going to school graduate school or after school or maybe you're a professor like
me if you're wanting to learn the greatest tips and ways to become your best scientist you might want
to get my book into the impossible think like a nobel prize winner with a forward by my friend nobel
laureate barry barish in it we describe an incredible series of tips on how to collaborate better unlock
your creative genius and get over common pitfalls like the imposter syndrome i hope you'll take a deep
dive into it and i know you'll enjoy it you can read a free chapter at my website briankeating.com books
and you can buy it at amazon.com in ebook audiobook or in physical hard copy or paperback form thanks a lot
very good okay richard the last question i have uh relates to arthur's law that actually is the
namesake of this podcast or what gave this podcast its name and it goes like this the only way of
discovering the limits of the possible is to venture beyond them a little way into the impossible so
that's why this podcast has its name i want to ask you if you could go back and see 20 year old 30 year old
richard and you had 30 seconds uh to speak to him what would you say to him to give him the confidence
you know to do as you've done to go into the impossible well something pretty similar i mean to
what arthur c clark said uh do believe that you can do it and and go ahead and and do and do it but
have have have confidence to actually do it richard this has been a delight for me and for my audience
like i said we will uh make it into many versions and and i hope uh you will continue to write and
be well and if i don't see you in san francisco i i hope to visit you at an oxford of the uk
uh this has been a great honor and a great delight i want to thank you so much thank you very much it
