This concept turned out to be one of the most important things about the internet.
The subscribe button allowed people who liked my stuff to sign up to see more of it in the future
and as a creator it gave me a channel of distribution to ensure that my future work
was sent to those people. It was a framework for the distribution of creativity and communication.
It made my dreams come true as an artist. The follow is a piece of internet architecture
that felt closer to magic than anything I had ever experienced in my life.
Hi everybody! Hello, hello! I've been thinking a lot about the whole arc of the internet and how
it's evolved over the last couple decades and then how I think it's going to evolve and Patreon's
place in all of that and that's what I want to share with you today. So I started making music
and videos and putting them on the internet right after I finished college in 2007. I made a ton of
movies in school. I also made animations as a kid so making stuff wasn't particularly new to me but
I had just spent at the time when I finished college six months and thousands of hours on a new record
called Nightmares and Daydreams. I was living at my dad's house at the time working out of my old
childhood bedroom and I was trying to figure out how to reach people with this new record that I
had worked so hard on like even the cover that guy on the cover is an actual clay guy that I made out
of Sculpey and then I did a photo shoot with him and I got a great shot but then I had to use the
lasso tool in Photoshop to cut him out and this was before the magnetic lasso tool so I had to do that
shit by hand and that took way too long but none of that mattered because by sheer luck I happened to
finish school right when this budding technology called the internet was going through a massive shift.
It was just starting to move from what people called Web 1 to Web 2.0. Web 1 was essentially a
read-only version of the internet. In retrospect people call this 90s version of the web the static
web. It was like AOL where you could browse web pages and read the news but there was no easy way
for people to upload and share and then in the early 2000s a slew of new companies like YouTube and
Facebook and Twitter came onto the scene and YouTube's motto was broadcast yourself. The whole idea of
Web 2.0 was that for the first time as a creative person you could easily participate on the internet
you could post and tweet and upload instead of just being a passenger and I thought that was
fucking awesome honestly I still think it's fucking awesome it's so easy to forget how magical this is
how special this is but this moment in history marked a shift for humanity and for artists and creators
especially because for the first time on the internet you could do more than just consume
you could create you could reach other people and it was in that moment right here in 2007 when I
have to graduate college and finish my record Nightmares and Daydreams and I was trying to reach people
with it and at the time my best bet was DMing bands on Myspace and asking if I could open for them
at local bars up and down the west coast I sent cold outreach to music venues to get booked and
then I got in my car because I couldn't afford to rent a van and I drove up and down the west coast
United States and I played the dankest local bars and I sang my guts out and I sweated and I sang and
I sweated and I sang and I ate tacos out of the back of my car while my friends were all getting promoted
in high-paying jobs as investment bankers and I did that for years tour after tour and I'm using the word tour
super lightly here like there weren't people at my shows like like nobody came I had no fans
on a good night there were a couple stragglers who wanted in off the street but I was playing empty bars
it was so hard to reach people so you can imagine how excited I was when a friend sent me a video
of a guy named David Choi singing with a guitar in front of his webcam on a new website called YouTube
and this video had like 300 000 views or something like that I couldn't believe it David was reaching people
this phase of the internet had the potential to solve a fundamental problem for me as an artist
I felt like I had to jump in and I did
I immediately started uploading videos to YouTube
back then no one else was showing the at-home recording process so I just filmed myself playing
instruments and then I layered them in the video with split screens so people could see all the
musical elements coming together to form a song and it's funny because in 2024 this idea seems totally
obvious but nobody was doing that back then it wasn't a fancy recording studio with millions of
dollars equipment it was a bedroom with an inbox audio interface and a cheap version of a laptop
recording software called pro tools le and an old sony handycam that I lugged around with me everywhere
that shot on high eight tapes and a bed comforter hung on the wall to dampen the sound and broken
symbols that a fan sent me in the mail for free but I was making real music I was screaming my
fucking guts out and playing accordion and doing collabs with friends and it started working
people started watching my videos and listening my music I was reaching people
my videos started getting thousands of views it wasn't millions of people at first but it was so much
better than playing empty bars so I kept doing it and by 2009 I had made 43 youtube videos of my songs and
I was feeling amazing because for the first time of my life I was actually reaching people with my work
but the real beauty of this new website called youtube the most amazing thing about it
was that it had a subscribe button
I only realized how truly special this idea was in retrospect but in my opinion this concept turned
out to be one of the most important things about this new era of the internet what people called
web 2.0 the subscribe button was foundational it changed youtube from being a tool to reach people
to being a way to reach them and then build a following around my work the subscribe button allowed
people who liked my stuff to sign up to see more of it in the future and as a creator it gave me a
channel of distribution to ensure that my future work was sent to those people so it turned out that
web 2.0 solved more than just reach more than just discovery it represented the birth of the follower
the follow is not some handy feature of a social network the follow is foundational architecture for
human creativity and organization the idea of a creator an artist or community of fans around
them who want to see their future work this concept the follow it's profound whether it's the following
that i was building as a musician or a podcasting duo who talks about what it's like to be single moms
in a community of single mothers who finally feel seen and understood or a science education creator
and students who didn't previously have access to high quality education the follow was a system of
organization for the entire internet it was a framework for the distribution of creativity and
communication not just reach but a step past it ongoing communication connection a sustained
relationship community and i learned just how magical the concept of the following could be
when i did my first collab with my girlfriend natalie we put up a video on my youtube channel in 2008
that was a song we created together and it was different than my music it was way less
screamy and insane but it was more active and fleshed out than her music so we decided to create
a new separate channel for our collabs and we called this new youtube channel pomplamoose well the first
pomplamoose video was actually posted on my channel and i had about 7 000 subscribers at the time and my
subscribers loved this new video and at the end of it we posted a little link to the new pomplamoose
channel to tell people about it and almost instantly the new pomplamoose channel got 3 000 subscribers
that's what a following is people see your new literally they follow you wherever you go on the
internet so natalie and i started making more videos and more videos and within a year we got
18 000 subscribers and then in one video we announced that we were playing a show and we showed up to the
show in san francisco and there were 40 people there and oh my god guys i cannot tell you what it's like
to have 40 people at your show after years of playing empty bars it was amazing
it was so great uh another time natalie and i were filming a vlog and my sister happened to walk in
like behind us she's a soap maker she was holding a bar of grapefruit scented soap pomplamoose means
grapefruit in french and she said hey guys look i have pomplamoose soap if you'd like a bar
natalie and i just saw that and decided to keep it in the video and our fans like oh my god pomplamoose
soap and so we made another video and we said okay now you can order pomplamoose soap and we got
hundreds of orders wrapped in toilet paper no another time when thumb drives were starting to
get huge we thought why do cds let's put all of our music on a thumb drive and we we loaded up the
thumb drives we put up a video we said hey if you want to buy a thumb drive you can buy a thumb drive
now and we ended up selling hundreds and hundreds of thumb drives we decided to sign every one of them
it was kind of crazy we had to like figure out the packaging we had no idea how to package that many
thumb drives my family ended up helping out dad's like taking pictures and stuff you know like it was
like really fun it was amazing um another time we decided to put our album on itunes our first
pomplamoose album back in like 2008 and we didn't have artwork so we asked our fans like hey do you
want to make the artwork for a pomplamoose and we got hundreds of submissions for the cover of the new
pomplamoose album from our fans and they were freaking talented this is the one that actually won
natalie and i just love this one so this is actually this is the artwork for our first album it was made
by one of our fans another time we booked a show at a laundromat um that's a sentence i just said uh
we we booked a show at a laundromat the idea was like as a laundromat where there is a cafe and a
laundromat you could go order food do your laundry eat by the time you're done eating take your laundry
home and we booked this show like if you crammed people in there it held like 60 people in this
laundromat and then we uploaded this video and this was the first video that we ever uploaded that went viral
and it got like half a million views overnight and we showed up to our show at the laundromat and
there were 200 people crammed inside the laundromat and then 150 or 200 people outside like spilling in
the street cars were swerving around them and like there was no stage like it's a laundromat so literally
i'm playing music and there's a person like i'm like looking at a person's eyes while i'm playing
pomplamoose songs like it was mayhem i don't have any pictures tonight but this is what it felt like like
it was just like insane and this was the first time i was like oh my god this is gonna work
having a following is amazing this is gonna work we're gonna be able to be full-time musicians
another time we posted another video and at the end of the video we told our fans hey we're uploading a
song to itunes we decided not to ever sign or kind of enter the the music industry we did everything
ourselves we negotiated our own contract with itunes directly we post our songs directly to itunes so we
kept almost all the revenue associated with that and when we posted this album we sold 30 000 songs
that month and we got 22 000 deposited directly into our bank account it was more money than i had
ever seen in one place ever in my life i was losing my mind it was so incredible
then then pomplamoose started playing shows and we started touring and you know hundreds of people
started showing up and then thousands of people started showing up this is my wife crowd serving
because she's a badass that's what i mean when i say that the subscribe button is not a silly feature
the concept of the follow changed my life it made my dreams come true as an artist it took me from
playing empty bars to living out my fantasy as a musician the follow is a piece of internet
architecture that felt closer to magic than anything i had ever experienced in my life
right around the moment that pomplamoose was starting to work right through all of this there
is this genius named kevin kelly he wrote an essay called a thousand true fans and his premise was
simple it was that in the age of the internet you don't need millions of fans to be successful if you
can just find a thousand people who are willing to buy a hundred bucks of stuff from you per year
that's a hundred thousand dollars per year which is a pretty freaking great business as a creative
person you just need a thousand true fans who really connect with you and believe in you
and this is different than just reaching people it's even deeper than followers this is super fans
true fans real fans call it whatever you want the idea is that there's this group of people that is
your core if reach means people see it and follower means people want to see more then true fans are
the people who go to the shows and buy the merch and download the record and pay for the course and
get the live stream tickets and all the things and this idea really resonated with me we had fans
showing up to pomplamoose shows with tattoos of the band custom t-shirts posters drawings artwork
icing of my face on a cookie i ate my face we had a fan who made an oil painting of me screaming my
fucking guts out i used this link release software called e junkie and i cobbled together like a little
mp3 store for myself on the internet and i would sell original music and i was selling 500 bucks a
month of my original songs on my own website fans were showing up to buy things to be there
one time we asked our pomplamoose fans to come film a music video with us on a saturday like show
up to dolores park in san francisco just show up and be in this music video and 50 people showed up
they even learned this dance and we shot this dance and the dance is in this pomplamoose video
another time we would actually always use this software called stage it which was like a ticketed
live stream software so we could play our songs people could buy tickets and show up live on the internet
and natalie and i would just sit at home and play these songs for 45 minutes and people would buy
tickets and leave tips during the concert and we would routinely make like three grand in 45 minutes
playing our songs it's like these are true fans another time natalie raised over a hundred thousand
dollars for her record from just two thousand people another time we made a pomplamoose album and we
went online on youtube we put up this video and we said hey everybody we have a new pomplamoose album
it's not for sale you can't buy it you can't get the new pomplamoose album the only way to get the
new pomplamoose album is if you donate a book to the richmond school district send us the receipt
for that book and we will send you the pomplamoose album for free and the richmond school district
ended up having to rent a shipping container to keep up with the packages it's like 11 000 books that got
sent to the richmond school it's like 140 000 worth of books it was amazing it felt incredible to see
that many people show up for this that's true fans real fans super fans call it whatever you want
but this was the concept that was rattling around in my head when i started patreon 11 years ago this
is actually the first sketch of patreon i called up my co-founder and he turned this into what is now
patreon and the idea was very simple it's like a membership platform where fans could sign up for a
subscription payment to the creator and the creator could run a membership and get paid for their work
i'm not going to tell the patreon founding story i've told a million times but the company is now
over 400 people 11 years in we have over 250 000 creators who have made over three and a half
billion dollars on the platform which i think of as proof if we ever needed it that the true fans are
there and the true fans are ready in the background while patreon was being formed building over the last
decade the whole internet was again starting to shift and if you think of the 90s as web one the 2000s
is web 2 right around the 2010s there was a new change happening facebook started experimenting with
a new thing called ranking and i realize most everybody here knows about this but what ranking
did was essentially it took the feed which you can think of as a list of posts from creators that i follow
and it analyzed each and every post for how engaging it was and if it wasn't engaging enough facebook
would then take that post and push it down in the feed in other words they started ranking or ordering
posts according to what was best for their business this was actually great for facebook it was the right
business decision for them and their company and their revenue model but what it meant for creators
was that for the first time since web 2.0 my followers might not necessarily see my posts
and this idea of a subscription started to break down if the person doesn't receive the things
it's not really a direct true connection between a creator and their fans it's not really a subscription
the channel of distribution is broken and it creates another problem too around creative freedom
because now suddenly my post has to be better than the other posts according to a set of criteria
that i don't know or have control of or even agree with so instead of thinking what do i want to
make what lights me up what is the output that i want to create as an artist what will my fans love
instead of thinking those questions now in the back of my mind i'm thinking what will the ranking algorithm
favor and that subconsciously or consciously changes my creative output to achieve facebook's goals not
my goals as a creator and if it were just facebook doing this fine creators would just leave and post
somewhere else but it worked really well it was great for facebook's business and people started
spending even more time on the platform so the other platforms had to compete and youtube launched the
cosmic panda redesign centering the entire company around watch time and twitter and instagram followed with
rank feeds in 2016 and we only saw it in retrospect but now i think of the 2010s as the decade of
ranking the decade when the original promise of the creator-led community the true follow was broken
for the first time i just do a quick aside here because i know there's this big debate in the world
about you know chronological feeds versus algorithmic feeds and i don't want to make it sound like i'm a
zealot uh on on either of the two polarized sides that's actually not the takeaway here it's not how
i think of it i actually see problems with chronological feats because as a creator if if it's
chronological then you have to keep posting to stay on top so i don't think that's necessarily the best
way to build strong relationships either the problem that i have is if you're going to change that if
you're going to adjust the way you you create a feed what is the purpose behind that what is the intention
behind that are you trying to create a place where you can build strength of relationship with your
community where your fandom gets energized over time where people are guaranteed that subscription
where you get a direct connection with your community and your true fans is that it or is it
maximizing attention is it maximizing watch time those are two very different goals and very different
ways of organizing your entire product as a technology company this one helps me as a creator and this
one hurts me as a creator it hurts my community it hurts my business it hurts my creative output
i wish that it stopped there but around the turn of the decade a new company came onto the scene
called tick tock and tick tock had a much deeper impact in the ecosystem i think anyone foresaw at the
time it wasn't just short form vertical first video that wasn't it that's a red herring i think
it was much more fundamental than that tick tock said we want to make the most engaging feed possible
this whole idea of a list of your subscriptions forget about that in fact forget about the whole
concept of subscriptions tick tock started from the ground up with something totally different called
for you where each of these posts are chosen for me by tick tock instead of me choosing what's in my feed
and this completely abandoned the concept of the follow but it worked tick tock hit a billion users by 2021
and traffic on the internet started flowing away from the legacy social companies and toward tick tock
so just like with facebook and ranking the other platforms had to compete youtube launched shorts
instagram launched reels and twitter launched a for you feed as well and within a couple of years
this whole system of organization for the internet the creator-led community started to fade into the past
i have really felt this personally as a creator in the last four years especially my fans don't see
as much of my stuff anymore it's harder to sell tickets to a show it's harder to reach people with
my new work it's harder to build community it's harder to build a business it's harder to energize my fans
what's happening here is we are in the middle of another shift and this is a big one
if the 90s was web one and the 2000s was web two and the 2010s was ranking i'm worried that the 2020s
could become the death of the follower i um got an email from a crater about a year and a half ago
and i got this email my heart just sank in my stomach hey jack i'm writing this letter to you hat
in hand due to changes at facebook overnight the traffic to my links my page has dropped by 80
as such it looks like i'll have to sell my home i'm dusting off my resume and looking for jobs in
social media management i'm seeing more and more of things like this and it's not just happening to
creators it's happening to anyone who posts stuff on the internet it's happening to media companies vice
and buzzfeed and roosterteeth announcements this is a really hard change to navigate for anyone who's
posting stuff online and trying to build community and business for the creators in the room i think
it's really important to remember that and and to understand that if you're not connecting as much
as you want to with your audience right now that does not necessarily mean there's something wrong with
you a lot of us as creators have this tendency be like what can i do better and that's a good impulse
honestly it's like growth mindset how is how can how am i contributing to this what can i do better
and again that's i think most of the time that's really good but there is also something happening
in the background right now it's a macro thing that's happening on the web that makes our jobs as
creators really hard right now there's a lot of smart people at big companies that are well-funded
big media companies trying to figure this out too and they're having trouble with it too
so as creators just know that it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you here
i believe that this problem is the single most important problem that faces creative people today
the weakening of creator-led communities of our distribution channels to our fans this is the
hardest most challenging and most painful issue threatening the present and the future of creativity
on the internet i actually i don't think that this is going to happen
i think the follow is too important to die i think it's too valuable to ignore i think it's too
useful and awesome for creative people for publishers for media companies and i think the next wave of
internet and media technology companies are going to surge on this problem and try to solve it
and it's actually already started and the incumbent social platforms they're not going to be able to
fight it because their revenue relies on maximizing attention to drive their businesses they're being forced
up towards discovery towards reach personalization algorithmic curation these are the levers that
drive attention and therefore they drive their strategies that's why there's a hole already
opening up and why we're starting to see a whole new set of companies emerge that look fundamentally
different from the legacy social landscape discord and kajabi and fourth wall gumroad moment which
patreon acquired last year the courses platforms events companies some people are calling this subset of
companies the creator economy i don't even think of it like that it's a fundamental
shift in approach and the hallmark strategy of the drivers of these businesses is the focus on
deeper connections as opposed to just more connections the true fan the real fan call it whatever you want
it's the five percent of fans that drive 90 of the community in business this is a direct fan
business this is an ads business this is about depth of connection this is about maximizing attention
this is about deeper fans this is about more fans and what binds this new wave of emerging companies
is that their strategic focus is down here the next decade of creative and media technology companies
will focus on building direct to fan connections and community strength as creators we'll still need the
social platforms we'll still need those companies up here for discovery for reach we need that but
those companies will be one component of the many tools that we have as creative people to help us run our
communities and businesses that's where the world is going i'm sure and personally right now i feel
a sense of responsibility through this i remember what it feels like to be a creator on the outside of
these platforms watching the internet move in a direction that i don't agree with and that i don't
like and that i don't think is good for my community and my business i remember what that feels like i
remember feeling anxiety i remember feeling fear i remember being scared of where that was going and
what it meant for me and now through whatever crazy life path i have been on as an artist i'm i'm now
finding myself as a ceo of one of these fucking tech companies and um i feel this sense of i want to
help build the type of internet that i want as a creator that's what i want to do
so i really don't want this talk to feel like a patreon ad actually i really hope it doesn't but um
but i do want to give you a sense of how i'm thinking about this problem given this seat that i'm in
and how patreon is now thinking about this problem and what we think our place is in it and what we
want to do about it and the headline is this it's been 20 or 30 years and the current version of how
art and community exists on the internet today i don't think is the right version how community and
art exists on the web i don't think it's the right way and i want to i want patreon to contribute to
building a better version of how art and community could exist on the internet we've oriented the whole
company around this problem we started as a membership platform 11 years ago subscription payments
but we have built a lot especially in the last three years in an effort to take a more holistic
approach to solving this we built video community podcasting better posting a new media player
commerce free membership which essentially like a follow gated on an email and live and while this
might look like a lot it's actually just three things media community and business and we're now
thinking of patreon no longer as a membership platform but as this whole thing the media community
and business foundation for the next decade of professional creativity on the internet organized
around the concept of the true follow in an effort to build a better way that art can exist on the web
that's the theory that's what the company is setting out to solve now in practice what that looks
like is a new set of products and tools that we built into patreon this is our first foray into community
essentially this allows fans to connect with each other and build energized fandoms and creators to hop in
there and talk with fans and it's a place for true fandom why do we build this what's the strategy and
the idea behind this here's why as a creator on the internet today i can get subscribers and i can get
views and i can if i can send my fans to instagram or tick tock and they can be there but what i've
noticed is those communities degrade over time i they they they don't get energized over time they get
de-energized it gets harder and harder to reach those people i make a post i reach two percent of my
audience i reach one percent of my audience i lose touch with those people and there's no way for me
to find those real fans those true fans the small portion of my fans that drive everything for me as
a creator the way we're building this and what i want as a creator is a place where i can send my
fans and that fandom gets energy over time that fandom gets closer that fandom gets more vibrant more
connected over time more enthusiastic over time that's what i want as a creator that's the space that i
want to have as a creative person creators deserve a place like that that is important it's important
for the future of creativity okay another thing that we built is commerce commerce allows creators to
sell a digital thing an episode a bonus episode a download a course anything that you can sell online
why did we build commerce creators send lots of people to their patreon millions of people to their
patreon pages every month what we found is a lot of those people are true fans they're like the really
intense interested excited fans but not all of those fans are ready to pay with a subscription
payment in fact a lot of them don't want to pay a subscription payment and why why don't they want
to pay well they either they have subscription fatigue which is a real thing or they're not in
the right financial situation or they don't want to commit to a payment every month but they're still
true fans and rather than having those true fans leave the creator we want to give creators a way
to start forming connections with those fans to build businesses with those fans and so we built
commerce as a way for the fan the true fans that aren't yet ready for a subscription payment they can
now participate in the creators business and community through this commerce product and and meanwhile
the crater can can build an awesome business along the way too the logic is very similar for free
membership why do we build free membership what is free membership by the way it's a think of this
as like a follow gated on your email so it's kind of like an email capture it allows a fan to follow
your page without paying in exchange for giving them your email and it's the same logic as commerce
creators are sending their true fans millions um every every month to their patreon pages
and we wanted to give creators a way to reach that portion of their fans that they go to the shows
they have the merch they have the hat they're true fans but for whatever reason they don't want to
buy one of the things you have digitally and they don't want to pay a subscription and this allows
creators to continue forming relationships with those fans and what's super exciting about this
is we have found that about 40 to 50 percent of these fans actually say that they intend to pay the
creator in the next few months have high intention to be a part of the craters community and business
and this gives creators a way to start building community with those folks
okay we also acquired a live experiences platform called moment and i don't even want to call it
ticketed live streaming because it's not it's so much more beautiful than that arjun and the team did
such an incredible job building this place for creators to sell tickets to these live experiences
and they can debut their work a stand-up special a movie that they've made a special episode that they
know is going to be a total banger whatever it is it allows creators to sell tickets to that experience
and then have community with those fans while they're all watching it together all that to say
the way we're thinking about this next phase is that we're not just a membership company anymore
we're a true fan company we're a creator company we're building a better way for art and community to
exist on the internet because i want patreon to build an internet where creators have true creative
freedom control of their businesses and their careers and i want it to feel like fire to be
part of a creator's community i know what it feels like to be part of an energized community i remember
it and i have that same conviction now that i did back in 2013 when i started patreon i know that it is
possible to build an internet where fandoms thrive and where professional creativity is possible for
anyone i believe this in my bones it is not a choice it's not optimism it's just deep down what i
actually know to be available to humanity if that is the path that we choose that's what patreon is
doing it's how we're thinking about this future and our and patreon's place in it but for the creators
in the audience creators don't have to wait over the last decade i've talked to thousands of creative
people i've had my own creative projects i've learned a lot and i want to share just a few thoughts
about navigating the the shifts in the internet and how we can all prepare ourselves and our communities
for those shifts we and we and we don't even need to wait for any of the any of the tech platforms
to catch up the first invest in those true fans invest in the depth of connection not just new
it's not all about new views new subscribers watch time up into the right it's about depth it's about
quality of interaction it's about finding that small portion of your fans that are your engine
that are your core and then figuring out how to reach them by the way sometimes when i talk about
this creators think well does that mean like dms like should i be talking to individual fans no not
necessarily that's not actually what i mean i mean finding those people and building real connections
with them in whatever capacity you have and my team will probably kill me for saying this but i'm
not it's not even using patreon there's like a bunch of ways that you can do this right like
you can do it via email lists you can get a discord you you could get a patreon if you want i'm a little
biased but i think you could you could find um some other place where you can build that community
with your true fans the point is find those people and invest in that community that is the engine
that will drive your business slingshot your business through these shifts in the internet
okay the second thing make beautiful things there is so much tension especially right now
to make for the algorithm and i've seen the diagrams i've seen the charts i've even drawn
them in my answer you know make for the algorithm make for yourself and then make the things that
help you build a business and you sort of there's a venn diagram little center part and that's the
sweet spot i've seen all that and i get that but the gravity everywhere we look as creators today
the gravity is just pushing us it's just pushing us toward making for other reasons than why we set
out to make things in the first place it's so important to remember to make beautiful things to
make things that light you up and to make things that you care about there's a wonderful metaphor that i
love um it's a business metaphor but it makes sense for creators too i think it's a metaphor of the
the business of the hot dog stand under the eiffel tower or the local restaurant and the hot dog stand
on the eiffel tower gets thousands of new customers coming through their hot dog stand every day right
because there's tourists just coming through and they know they're gonna get lots and lots of new
customers none of those people come back but it doesn't matter because they're just always getting
new customers every day because the eiffel tower and they just make hot dogs and sell them
and some portion of those customers buy their hot dogs actually don't even have to be very good hot
dogs right they just like sell hot dogs they know they're gonna keep making money
and that business works like it works it's an okay business there's another business which is the local
restaurant business where the people there just focus on making great food and having great service
and they actually are not in a place that gets a lot of foot traffic so they don't get lots of new
customers but everybody in like a five mile radius eats there twice a month and they just get lots of
repeat customers because they've built trust and they've built depth of connection with those people
and people know that restaurant and love it know they're gonna have a great time when they're there
that is a great business you don't have to get lots of new and billions and acquisition and you don't
that's not the only type of business you can build as a creator there's this wonderful group of
creators oh my god i've fallen in love with them anybody heard of the youtube new wave
it's this group of creators they make these wonderful 30 45 minute long form
films mini documentaries about their lives and their struggles coming into the world and quitting
college and they're beautiful it's incredible they're patient they're slow the films are long
but oh my god the depth of the message in these films is incredible and they're building such a
strong community around their work people just love what they have to say and can't wait to see the
next one that's a real business that's a real community it's different than what we're incentivized
to do everywhere on the internet but that that works okay know what you want the hardest lesson i have
learned as a creative person and as an operator and ceo is to know and trust what i want and to be true to
that over time that's easier said than done don't let somebody else tell you what you want because then
you'll end up with what they want instead of what you want a good example of that is as creators we open
up our our dashboards and we see these metrics on what success is this is a dashboard that someone else
built for us and it tells us what we want and the weird thing is after a couple of years we begin to
we like start to believe that like our minds get reprogrammed and we believe this is what i want
this is success and we chase that if you went back in time and you asked ella fitzgerald or david bowie
or prince what do you want what's your goal as an artist what matters to you do you think bowie would
have said my goal as an artist is to maximize the amount of human hours spent consuming my work
i don't know what bowie wanted i'm not gonna pretend to you but i can tell you what i want as an artist
i can tell you what matters to me as a creative person and what i know will matter to me 10 years
ago now and 10 years from now i want to say something that matters to somebody i want to say
something that only i can say because of whatever experience i've had in my lived experience
something that is uniquely pointed to me i want to say that i want to figure out how to say that i
want to find that core of human truth in my experience and communicate it eloquently and clearly
and have it be true and feel true and have someone else see that and have that person think yes
that feels true and it feels true to them and i want that person to feel connected to me even though
we've never met before in our lives but i said a thing that resonated with them and made them feel
a little bit less alone because they felt like there was another person who had that same experience
i want to make things that are timeless i want to make things that feel true now i want to make things
that feel true in 50 years i want to make things that still feel true 500 years after i'm dead
i want to figure out how to use my short years on this planet to find that kind of truth and say it
that's what i want as an artist and that's a very different goal than watch time that may not be what
you want as an artist and that's okay but the point is to know what you want what matters to you
what are you trying to achieve as a creative person we have this tendency to look outside for those
answers i do it too this advice is honestly more for me than it is for anybody else in this room
we want there to be a yoda we want there to be a leader or a manager or a voice of authority that can
tell us what we want because it's a scary thing to ask but that does not exist what we want comes
intrinsically not extrinsically it comes from in here that's where we find it so as we navigate
this next phase of the internet as creative people as we go through these ups and downs of the web in
its ever-evolving state do not forget what matters to you as an artist do not forget what fills you with
pride to make do not forget your purpose for making things in the first place don't forget why you
wake up in the morning and devote your time and energy to your craft don't forget what gives you a
sense of meaning as a creative person and lastly don't forget to scream your book with that sound
thank you everybody appreciate you
