there is a war underway we have to fight for democracy the way in which biden harris ran the
campaign the campaign the way in which keir starm is currently doing things yeah this is also not
going to work and that's part of the problem welcome back to the tea the show where we dive
into the stories behind the headlines i'm your host miriam francois 2024 saw the most far-right
parties elected in recent elections across europe and indeed within the european parliament itself
far-right movements are surging across the world from winning elections in germany and austria to
president trump's recent comeback in just a few weeks he's pardoned over a thousand five hundred
people convicted in the january 6 attack on capitol hill he's done away with dei programs threatened
tariffs to mexico china and canada and laid the groundwork for mass deportations including in
gaza our democracies are in crisis and few seem to understand why but is fascism just rising or has
it always been a feature of our societies what do billionaires like elon musk and zuckerberg have to
gain from aligning themselves with this movement and what exactly is at stake as the far right continues
to make electoral strides to break it all down i'm joined by dr nafeez ahmed an award-winning
investigative journalist author and systems theorist his reporting has taken down far-right networks
exposed corruption and forced resignations at the highest levels his new book alt reich the network
war to destroy the west from within digs deep into how this movement really works he has predicted some
of the biggest political and economic shocks of the past two decades including the 2008 financial
crisis now before we get into it can i ask you to do one thing to support the show hit that subscribe
button now and sign up to our patreon details are in the caption below thank you welcome to the tea
nafeez thanks miriam thanks for coming on um first of all for those who are not familiar with you and
your work can i just ask you to tell us a little bit about yourself and how it is that you've come to
do the work that you do today as a young british muslim um i wanted to understand things like terrorism
things like extremism um i wanted to understand some of the big conflicts that were affecting many
parts of the muslim world so i got very interested in in the study of of conflict and what drives
conflicts ended up doing a phd on um the colonial systems and how different colonial systems can lead to
different types of violence and genocidal violence um and that led me down to a rabbit hole of trying
to understand systems and how they work and one of the things i was really intrigued by and alarmed by
was was this pattern that you keep seeing in history where systemic breakdown and crisis drives people
to kind of the fringes and and can lead to to mass violence and kind of other rising different groups
and why the far right what sort of sparked your interest in looking deeper at these movements
growing up you know as as a young british muslim i'm ethnically bangladeshi getting called apaki in
the street now and again and having people make jokes about curry and just weird and people smelling
like curry and stuff like that was just normal right that was just like the path of the course um my my
why she um experienced a lot of really hardcore racism growing up you know her um parents and her
family were often targeted by like literal combat 18 thugs um and it was in you know really insane
for people who don't know who combat 18 are can you just give a sense of what this yeah so again
combat 18 obviously doesn't exist anymore um thank god but it was a military kind of paramilitary wing
of the bnp the british national party which was obviously the neo-nazi party set up quite decades
ago now and combat 18 was kind of their um we're going to fight on the streets kind of movement thing
um so they would go they would literally go around harassing um brown people black people on the streets
of london just looking at what happened last year with the with the riots in the summer that really felt
like what the hell is going on like we thought we were past this you know this was like 20 more than
20 years ago you know 20 30 years ago we had we had stuff like that going on in the streets of london
and to see that again to see you know group gangs of of of white supremacists running around the streets
kind of literally targeting people of color um and trying to set fire to you know these these buildings
where their asylum seekers are staying was was actually terrifying and and it made you kind of
think where is this going you know what is going on is this is this now the taste of things to come
like what the hell is happening yeah no absolutely i feel like exactly what you're saying this summer
was a real wake-up call for many people that you know there had been signs that the far right was
on the up uh the influence of far right ideology i think is more and more palpable in the mainstream
what distinguishes your analysis from others is that you're not suggesting that this is sort of
um the emergence of a far right uh a new far right but actually that there's a level of continuity
with the uh nazi ideology that obviously led to the holocaust uh but also uh you know has
been the underpinning of many uh currents of thought that are still alive in europe and the world
uh today the western world in particular i should say so can you just outline your analysis and how
you came to this conclusion from the time of the nazis in the 1930s there there was a deliberate effort
to after the second world war um to actually rehabilitate nazi ideology in a new post-nazi context
by whom by nazi sympathizers and white supremacists many of whom at the time had actual close connections
to to the nazis so much of the story revolves around an obscure foundation called the pioneer fund
it was set up in new york in the 1930s uh by a textiles magnate in america um and these guys were
open nazi sympathizers they and they were actually in touch with nazis in germany but even before they
came to power they were there was a lot of kind of cross fertilization of ideas between american
eugenicists and nazi german eugenicists and they were inspiring each other in fact and you know a lot
of the german eugenicists were looking at what the americans were doing on on immigration um on kind of
sterilization laws all of this stuff which was targeted against black people um and also openly
at that time targeted against jews they were looking at that and saying we should do stuff
like that here in nazi germany that's really inspirational we should do that and so they
brought those in and then when they actually got into government and they started implementing
these things on an industrial scale that was massive inspiration for the american eugenicists and
they were like wow that's amazing let's import that to the united states so they actually began um
attempting to move legislation in the u.s inspired by nazi germany so it was this very um terrifying kind
of vicious cycle that was taking place there a cycle of radicalization but of course after the
second world war it wasn't fashionable to be a nazi like you couldn't go around being like hey i'm a
nazi you get punched in the face or something like well particularly because of course the u.s presents
itself as the liberator of europe from the grips of nazism absolutely i mean that's the narrative
yeah they just won the war um so it didn't make sense so these guys went kind of underground on the
very pro-nazi stuff what they then tried to do is literally reframe themselves as we hate nazis
we were against nazis so you had actual nazis who didn't like jews didn't like black people didn't
like anyone um and and they were coming around saying actually we're not nazi we hate nazis
so the whole kind of narrative started to shift and what they did is they focused on new things so
they started to really double down um not on things like anti-semitism because they knew that
that wouldn't have traction instead they were focusing on like the civil rights movement
but uh they really doubled down on anti-black activism um and you can see how they began to
actually uh move into these spaces with a lot of success so the pioneer fund was actually financing
a lot of these anti-civil rights uh movements and working with senior republican politicians
um and that's what i think is really astonishing about the book is it takes that stuff that happened
then and it shows how this this kind of lobby or group this nexus around the pioneer fund
managed to infiltrate and subvert mainstream conservative thinking right from the get-go
you know working with groups like the heritage foundation they're one of the largest conservative
think tanks in america they've influenced every republican government for decades and they're still
going today and massively influential right now in the trump administration and all of the mad
executive orders that trump is pushing through a lot of this has already been written
in this project 2025 plan that was hatched um before uh trump came in um and heritage foundation were
the people behind that who coordinated lots of different experts and right-wing kind of thinkers
across the landscape you know across like a hundred odd conservative institutions and i think that's
what people don't realize and it didn't stop there it was all over the world i mean even the institute
for economic affairs which is obviously a very well-known right-wing think tank in the uk was very
responsible kind of the thatcherite kind of free market policies these guys have also been influenced
by this kind of thinking so when you say influence just for people who are watching this who are thinking
this all sounds a little conspiracy theorists that who are very skeptical you know what exactly do you
mean by they influenced mainstream think tanks both in the us and the uk so what i do in the book is i
actually trace the activities of particular individuals and how they intersect with all these
networks and just tell the story yeah and it's entirely up to people to make up their own mind about
what they think but it's really astonishing so we go back to around the 1970s when the heritage
foundation was set up right um at that time they actually were already influenced by the pioneer
fund so ed fuelner who was one of the co-founders he recruits this guy called roger pearson roger
pearson was already working with the not with the nazi aligned pioneer fund they had been funding
eugenics research in different universities in america and just for those who don't know eugenics
researchers research that kind of seeks to confirm the notion that there are biological determinants
to hierarchies of humans right there are more or less advanced humans this is pure nazi ideology
and that you can find a scientific basis for that sorry that's right and this and this is pretty
important because what you what was happening in this in these in these decades is that the strategy
was to launder nazi ideology into into the mainstream under the semblance of science and to
but to kind of remove the the origins the nazi origins from that and the book that really encapsulates
how clever they were in doing this is is called the bell curve um it's by a guy called charles murray who
is kind of american social scientist seemed to be very distinguished and all the rest of it
but he put together this book all of the research was basically um from kind of stuff that was funded
by the pioneer fund like all of this stuff and what he said is that he believes that the reason that
there are massive inequalities in society is not because there's anything to do with society and
system and policy it's all because there are genetically determined largely genetically determined
inequalities in iq so in the intelligence so biology has created and and genetics creates this
this uh kind of hierarchy in society black people at the bottom white people are at the top
there's debates amongst them about which other people might be in between but that's what they
all agree on um how original um so just very briefly because um i think what might be confusing
is that the the idea that this fund so the pioneer fund that exists in the u.s from the 1930s right
they are aligned with nazi germany which of course begins to rise in the 1930s and then comes to power in
1939 when hitler's elected and of course then takes over europe you know including parts of france
um and europe is in the grips of nazism which has as its main focus uh you know jewish people
uh romany people uh disabled people communist anyone who opposes gay people of course who also oppose
um nazism we we kind of understand nazism's uh focus on these people but are you saying that the target
of nazi um um i suppose violence and nazi eradication policies was not fixed because
does it then change they get to the us and they're like okay nazism out of fashion now can't be an
open nazi anymore let's just switch it up it just seems a little odd to me that they can just switch
their focus like how does that happen so what's interesting is you go back to even the evolution
of nazi ideology that gives us a sense of how it worked right because they didn't come out straight
away and say that's the final solution let's do it they that was a radicalization process what they
started off with was were these general ideas that there's inferior populations and there's superior
populations that was the grounding obviously we've this is not that new we've had this during
colonization there were these ideas and there was some some of them were linked to social darwinism
and these evolutionary the distortion of darwinist theories of evolution saying that actually these
are just biological hierarchies some people are just better than others and it's biology so that was
kind of the origin of these ways of thinking and under the nazis this began to be um kind of
solidified and cemented so the nazis really pioneered this kind of eugenics research which looked at well
if there are these biological hierarchies but we need to kind of in order to have survival of
civilization we have to take control of this so that's what it was all about it was like you need
to have a political program that engineers societies in such a way that the the fittest
rise to the top and and the ones who are a problem to get rid of them and that was where it began to
be well who are those ones who are problems oh are they disabled people that they're obviously not
going to be great for society wow roma um and so you know that that's why the the the nazi holocaust
targeted a wide range of groups but obviously the jewish people were particularly targeted and were
seen as an as as there was there was this anti-semitic ideology that that adolf hitler drew on and really
kind of gravitated towards and said these people are are fundamentally parasitical they're they're the
biggest problem and eventually it was like when as they were planning things and doing things um what
was what started off as a containment deportation policy rapidly became that's not working an
extermination extermination policy so what you're saying is that nazism is basically driven by the
idea of a hierarchy of human value and uh the idea that actually we serve that you know they believe
that they serve society best by eradicating these sort of um weaker strands of the human race god forbid
um and that whilst in the second world war the focus of that was uh the jewish people predominantly
but also roma people gay people etc um that today that focus has shifted to some extent but the
underlying principles are the same is that would that be a fair that's right i think you found that
what we found is that people like charles murray um bought into the general ideology so who's
charles murray charles murray this american social scientist he was he got a massive fund from this
major conservative foundation uh the the bradley foundation which gets most of its money from
industrial automation actually um and these guys are one of the biggest funders of conservative
groups in america so they fund they gave him i think up to a million dollars over several years
he wrote this book he took all of this scientific racism that the pioneer fund was was was essentially
bankrolling to to kind of do more research they were doing all sorts of very very weird research like
blood studies and all this kind of stuff put it together and kind of repackaged it into this
conclusion that oh these there are these you know science says that there are these biological hierarchies
and black people are basically inferior to white people they're intellectually cognitively inferior
they have lower iq there's nothing we can do about this what does that mean politically and economically
well we should not have a welfare state because why would you put money into groups of people
that are inherently unproductive and stupid wow so you need to do other things control the birth rate
contain the population obviously have massive immigration controls so what was interesting is that this was
really attractive to neoclassical and neoliberal economists now those are basically the economists
who became very big around kind of thatcher and reagan era yeah who were basically saying we need
total freedom of movement for capital right for you know people with huge amounts of money should not
be constrained in what they do by government policy as you are to pretty much invest where they like go
across borders do what they want so massive deregulization private economic power should be
able to do pretty much what it wants but you contain populations in that way so that was very attractive
to it made a lot of sense to people so when charles murray was then going around speaking about his
ideas he didn't go around saying um you know he wrote this book and he he said look there are these
structures and this means we need to do certain policies yeah but he then focused a lot on this
idea of the underclass and what was really funny was like it wasn't funny it was kind of crazy yeah
in the 1990s he wrote after writing this book rupert murdoch of all people you know the owner of all
the kind of right-wing press in britain the times the sunday times he also had you know fox news and all
of that at that time yeah um he flew charles murray over to britain um where he wrote a bunch
of articles for the sunday times he went and met the institute for economic affairs which is today
like the hard brexit think tank it was the driving force of brexit um he met with those guys did some
briefings he met with number 10 he went met with the treasury he met margaret thatcher herself
um he was like the darling of the establishment and he inserted into british discourse this idea of the
underclass there is this there is this group of people in britain who are just problematic
culturally economically um and he was very clever about it when he went to the uk he didn't talk so
much about genetics yeah he spoke about all of this all of the political and economic implications of
what he was saying and that's what they swallowed and they were like wow that's amazing we love that
so then you have this unholy alliance between these libertarian capitalists who want sort of
neoliberal economics to dominate because they want to ensure that there are no barriers to their big
corporations or funders being able to trade in the world and these eugenicists who are providing the
sort of intellectual lubrication the intellectual justification for the stratification of society
that will inherently flow from those economic choices is that exactly what you're saying i just
want to take a second to um kind of remind people that these conversations about um things like
eugenics and the notion that there are some people who are lower iq uh biologically etc it might sound
like this is some crazy out there stuff right people are like no one really believes that anymore but i
just want to draw your attention to a conversation just a few years ago in 2019 between jordan peterson
okay one of the most watched and listened to pseudo intellectuals at least today i would use that term
uh and a podcaster a white nationalist podcaster and proponent of so-called men's rights in which
peterson defended the bell curve right the bell curve which is the book that you were referencing
that argues that there are just inherently some people with lower iqs biologically and he said this he
said this is peterson's own words iq is a particularly ugly aspect of science because the iq literature
reveals that which no one wants to face oh that classic one which is that there are profound and
virtually irremediable differences in people's cognitive performances and that those differences
have a very solid biological and heritable basis no one wants to hear that he says well yes because it's
false false and racist but um you know he and others are obviously going off this idea that there are
truths that the liberals just don't want to hear right and and that narrative extends beyond what he's
just saying here so can you give us a sense of how much these ideas have seeped into mainstream
conversations mainstream political ideas mainstream policies um if if someone like jordan peterson can say that
on a public platform just a few years ago how far has this now gone give us a sense so i think that
and this is what i think the book um ends up demonstrating i think that this this ideology
of that's inspired by nazi eugenics you know this scientific racism this hierarchical ideology
i think that it has become very mainstream i think it has penetrated the heart of a wide range of major
conservative institutions around the world and that it started in the united states this process
it was exported around the world through vehicles like the heritage foundation through the institute for
economic affairs um let's not let's remember that sir anthony fisher british chicken farmer who
founded these think tanks made a lot of money he was upset about labor uh coming into power after the
second world war he set up what is now known as the atlas network which is you know he founded the
institute of economic affairs as well he was involved with people who were behind the heritage foundation
he helped set up the whole infrastructure of conservatism in the in in the uk and the hot
the atlas network is now just under 500 organizations in just under 100 countries all over the world
so these and they're all interconnected and what do they believe what are they advocating so that again
they're advocating these very extreme free market policies they want total deregulation for big capital
big finance big tech and what is the connection between that idea and the eugenics so the the big
connection here is that charles murray's ideas about the biological hierarchy in society is a brilliant
underpinning if you believe in extreme deregulation because it justifies the idea that there is no point
in the state attempting to deal with um inequalities in society and problems in society those are all
those problems according to that ideology are due to groups of people and their own issues to do with
their biology or there'd be no point to usaid for example yes for instance people absolutely are not in
need so just don't spend on them anymore stop spending on them it's a total waste of money that's the
ideology which is now official us government policy yes one of the first to be brought in under the
trump administration i want to ask you about the stage of fascism that we're at because you know
we're having this conversation and you're outlining the reality that today there are very powerful uh
political parties think tanks intellectuals or pseudo-intellectuals who are beholden to these ideas
of racial hierarchies of the justification for the stratification of societies and maybe even
beyond that the notion that some people just are not worthy of you know um of life actually because
that's what we're talking about you know usa the consequence of removing usa is that some people will
die because we're not providing the means for them to stay alive um are what what stage of fascism
are we at now that elon musk who is now part of the us government gets up and repeatedly does a nazi
salute out in the open like what stage is that because i think in the mainstream discourse in
legacy media we're seeing it discussed almost as if it's a debate did he didn't he but also we're seeing
sort of like well you know it's just a bit out there he's just a bit out there what analysis do
you make of what we saw there so you know i don't know whether elon musk himself personally
is an avid nazi like no one knows no one can know that but what is clear is that if you look at
physically what he actually did that was a physical nazi salute i mean that's what it was
um so the question is why did he do that um did he and i guess you know people are debating was it
intentional was it unintentional but when you look at the context yeah he did it repeatedly i think what's
interesting is you know if someone shows you who they are you can't believe them it's okay you know
i mean as a woman yes once someone shows you who they are believe them the first time yeah we had
three opportunities yeah and you know look at what he's been doing in the context of this story that we
see that we see developing it's not just about that history it's about how it's impacting in real time
these different these powerful individuals so we can see that that there are direct points of
influence on things like the nazi pioneer fund and you know these big tech bro people so you know
people like people in silicon valley like elon musk's uh partner peter teal you know these guys
partner together peter teal is another major silicon valley guy many people don't know who he is in
britain but he's he um was the founder of one of the founders of paypal yes you know he um was also
big investor in facebook also um now he's in palantir is obviously what he's very well known for
now which is a major defense contractor and and um kind of big data behemoth so peter teal is another
of these billionaires he was he teamed up with musk they helped set up the america pack uh you know and
you know which funded the campaign to get trump in now peter teal has so many points of interconnect
interconnection with these groups so one of the in his biography written by max chafkin who is a
bloomberg reporter um he reports that peter teal actually bankrolled and gave seed funding to
a magazine called quillette which all experts most experts agree is basically just a clearing house for
repackaging this scientific racism stuff um you know they've they've tried to elevate charles murray
and his ideas and they've elevated other kind of eugenics ideas um and there's so many other points
i think that's just one example right elon musk look at what he's been doing on x right he has been
signal boosting nazis he has been allowing nazis back onto the platform he's actually had direct
conversations with nazis on his platform as well he has endorsed weird statements which are anti-semitic
saying like there was one comment by by someone who said that western jewish populations are part
of this conspiracy to bring mass immigration uh to destroy white people and he was like yes i agree with
this so this is uh this is this is what he's been doing so when you look at what he's been doing on his
platform and then you and then and then you connect that with what he did you know during during the
inauguration why would you say that these are two different things so so let me ask you about that
in a bit more detail so when musk made that nazi salute um the adl the anti-defamation league which
was created to combat anti-semitism at least purportedly um rushed to his defense okay they were out
here trying to find any number of excuses for why um musk is not somehow an anti-semite uh why would an
organization like the adl and i pick out the adl but we could have selected others who came to musk's
defense why would the adl with their mandate to combat anti-semitism go out of its way to defend what
pretty much everyone could see was a fascist salute why would they do that yeah i mean it's
difficult to understand what's going on here i think the adl um which has produced some interesting
information about anti-semitism racism and islamophobia they found themselves in an odd
political position where they felt the need to ally themselves with musk that raises all sorts of
questions about how the adl has situated itself historically in relation to what's going on in
israel what's going with the u.s administration and what function they see themselves playing to me
it seems that um they they wanted to ingratiate themselves with this incoming administration and
they were willing to essentially downplay this thing in order to do that but but these this is not the
only uh example i could point you to so um last year after october the 7th happened we had a big
march in france against anti-semitism and in the front row of this march in what i personally take to
be an affront to the jewish community we had marine le pen the daughter of jean-marie le pen who was an
algerian tortionary an open anti-semite somebody who denies the holocaust you know and
his daughter who's taken over the mantle of the party and rehabilitated and we'll talk about how
these parties have rehabilitated hands standing hand in hand with members of the jewish community
in a march against anti-semitism there is no version of reality in which i believe marine le pen to be a
reformed racist the statements that her party makes about minorities about immigrants about black and brown
people on a regular basis and particularly around muslims are an obvious indication that that would
be a lie so we're seeing not just with the adl but in this instance and others we could think of
examples of where there seems to be this weird rapprochement between the far right and some
organizations who claim to be combating anti-semitism what is going on with that so this is an
interesting thing because it goes back i think to what was attempted right from the beginning after
the second world war which is oh we're not nazis so you've got these nazis who are traditional
anti-semites in a new post-nazi world and they have to say actually we're against nazis and one of the
things that they did was to say actually we're very pro-israel that was one of the first tactical
shifts that they did but why so because they had to defend themselves and they wanted to say we're
not anti-semitic so what that did is it created this interesting dynamic right where you had all
of these burgeoning far-right groups and i think if you go back to say 20 30 years ago israel's response
to those groups would have been and was we can't work with those groups those people are obviously
anti-semitic but things changed and especially changed with benjamin netanyahu so just as an
example of this in 2016 the israel's foreign ministry labeled the austrian fbo which is a
historically actual nazi party like they have former ss members yeah yeah this is not they're not like oh
we were founded then and and now we've become you know a little bit neo-nazi these guys actually
collaborated with the nazis in the second world war right so and and they wrote when they reformed
again they and kind of revitalized they did it on the back of these nazi fraternities in austria which
it was and this is really well documented and really disturbing right these guys are now basically
in government they're in the coalition um and in 2016 the israeli foreign ministry was like
those guys are extremists they're anti-semitic they have this nazi adjacent thing we shouldn't work
with them right fast forward a few more years benjamin netanyahu's in there he's like no no no
no let's invite them over so then they they had meetings with the fpo it's all fine hunky dory
so so there is a tactical shift there and again can't read people's minds but for the fpo why would
they do it obviously because they have this very clear nazi uh ancestry and they want to position
themselves to say no no we're not anti-semitic they want to make themselves palatable they want
to deny um the reality of what they are by saying that's not what we are so they're trying to rebrand
themselves for the for is for for the right-wing extreme in israel represented by netanyahu why
would they do that well this is where it gets quite machiavellian right despite knowing so the israeli
government literally has said those people are anti-semitic they're partnering with those people
because of an alignment geopolitically right that those guys are going to be pro-israel they're going
to support what we're doing in gaza and support what we're doing in palestine and they won't
criticize us there'll be an ally in europe in that respect and that works for us even if it means that
they're a threat to jewish people in austria but surely that's also aligned because obviously israel
wants to encourage jewish people to flee to the supposed you know homeland which of course is the
occupation and so having alliances with far-right neo-nazi groups who are going to make life really
difficult for jewish people and other minorities also serves their purpose surely well again again
i would i would say there's you know there's different factions in israel you know some people
believe certain things some believe other things definitely the extreme right wing have very weird
and dubious ideas there are some people in the extreme right wing in israel who want to see and
have spoken about the idea of things getting harder for jews and israel being the safe haven and people
should just be should just leave uh they should leave europe because europe is like this and europe's
like that um not everyone obviously believes that even in the even in the israeli right wing they don't
not everyone believes that yeah so i don't want to oversimplify that but you are right that it raises
this question of what exactly how can you how else can you interpret netanyahu openly allying himself
with anti-semites in in europe and and and and saying that that's good for jews how can it be good
for jews unless you have this idea that actually these anti-semites might do bad things to jews in
europe and that's okay it's it's it's a very strange and it's a moral quagmire and it kind of sums up the
whole reality what netanyahu's been doing and isn't but isn't that because part of the deal that
seems to have been struck at least from my perception is that as long as you focus your nazi
fascist ideas and ideals on the muslims and on the immigrants and the asylum seekers we won't get in
your way if you also clearly in the back doors in your back rooms continue to hold these anti-semitic views
i think there's absolutely a a strange emerging alliance that we have seen that in the way in
which israel has forged these relationships with not just the austrian fpo but a number of these
groups in europe who have these far-right fascist can you name some for us well even even the republican
party the republican party has has been elevating these kind of eugenics ideas right um even and you
look at the christian zionist ideology which is actually believes that israel is going to be
destroyed in a massive armageddon what what is going on why is it that that israel thinks that
it's a good idea of people and some people in israel think that's a great idea let's partner with those
guys yeah so there are there is a there is a corporate quo type agenda being put in play where
it's like let's ally with some of these groups knowing that right now the target is going to be
immigrants it's going to be people certain people of color it's going to be muslims especially and that
works because if we have an this idea of you know there's just this homogeneous threat for muslims
um whether it's within uh palestine or whether it's in europe or in other parts of the middle east
that works very much for for israel's own geopolitical kind of interests in the region
their own the way that they've conducted the the war on gaza and all the rest of it and that works
very well for for the us government the new the republican agenda that they have and the kind of
authoritarian control mechanisms that they're trying to put through works very well for those far-right
parties if you want to kind of remake world order and they're using the specter of this massive muslim
threat as the rationale it all fits together is it going to stay like that forever i don't think so
because these guys disagree fundamentally on so many different things yeah but on that but there is that
convergence point that is leading to this very dangerous radicalization the tea is a fully independent

honest impactful conversations if you believe in our work please subscribe to our youtube channel just
click that subscribe button now and join us on patreon you'll find the link in our bio can you outline
for us some of the uh ideas from these fascist groups think tanks ideologues that have now become
normalized in how we think in the mainstream and i mean one of the obvious ones to me is the great
replacement theory so uh in france the great replacement theory has now become completely mainstream
um we hear it debated in on news you know prime time tv discussion over how muslims are you know set to
outnumber you know the native uh european population i mean these discussions have become uh part and
parcel of how people are now thinking about the world i'll be talking to somebody in france
you know casually in a supermarket and they will just casually land that you know uh we have to do
something about the muslim takeover um so run run us by some of the things we should be attentive to
and where the roots of those ideas have actually come from yeah i mean so the great replacement theory
um this idea that there is this some sort of plan or conspiracy um often by liberals uh to to bring in
totalitarian sharia islamist muslims that'd be us that would be us yeah from from you know
different parts of the world largely africa the middle east and other places
places and and it's good and they're going to replace white people and they're this that's the
plan um i mean what's interesting about this is that this dovetails with the cultural marxist
theories another one of these weird theories become really mainstream right so and both of these come
from these historical again very kind of nazi type ideas about the threat from other populations
inferior populations repackaged with eugenics and all the rest of it so the cultural marxism theory
again was about you know there's a bunch of jewish liberals academics who have decided they're going
to fight this culture war against um the west and they're going to undermine western institutions
through culture um and that so that dovetails with this idea right but but this totally contradiction
doesn't even make sense like you've so you've got this alliance of jews liberals you know gender
fluid transgender liberals um and and islamist totalitarians who hate gay people and hate
everything and they're all working together and they're all going to come and replace white people
and that's the plan that's literally what we are being sold as a coherent theory can we just take a
second to absorb the level of incoherence and yet and yet it is now perceived common knowledge
that in our universities in the halls of power at the bbc these groups are all working together
to sort of you know subvert traditional values i mean how it's a tour de force you know from from a
pr perspective nafiz how have they done this this has been like decades of work right of trying to
normalize these ideas and i think what we've not quite understood and i think that also becomes quite
clear in the book that there is a machine that is driving this it's not just happening by accident
what do you mean by a machine so so you have so this is how it works right you've got these
and and so i've hinted a little bit some of it right so you've got these big foundations
who funds them they're not they're not ordinary philanthropies right but who funds philanthropies
is people with this huge amount of money okay so mostly people people like the cotch industries
who are very well known right i mentioned the bradley foundation like you know who are i mean
there's the scaife foundation the robert mellon foundation all these different foundations
they won't mean anything to be with the but what do they represent they represent huge amounts of money
based on key industries it could be fossil fuels i mentioned industrial automation
banking finance hedge funds so these guys have made all their money and these guys are looking at
this and they set up these foundations they put these they create these foundations which then
create these think tanks they create these um brands which they make the brand sound really um kind
of serious and these guys know what they're talking about they then create these figureheads people
like charles murray people like douglas murray in britain people like uh jordan peterson they they
help them with their you know books they then provide pr to support them they get them onto all the channels
they train them they even get them to do fitness training and make them look good and style them
and everything and then they put them all all the way in the age of social media they'll do everything
they'll create memes around them they will um they will they will they will run their campaigns on
facebook on instagram on x on you know snapchat you name it they're there and that that is what's happening
it's a machine so along that way different parts of that machine have been stress testing what are
the ideas are really going to land right so renaud came us the french guy who wrote this first time
he wrote the great replacement theory he wasn't the first guy that said this no they had all these
they had loads of american racists people like daniel pipes right people like john sullivan who was at
the heritage foundation he was also advisor to margaret thatcher he's now in hungary running a
think tank with victor auburn these guys are writing about this stuff back then right there's a birth
death of white people there is all these uh you know dark-skinned brown people coming and they're
going to take over most of them are muslims they were saying this stuff but then red on camos came and
he said this is the great replacement and then and then people in on the in the on the in the kind of
conservative powers that be looked at that i'm like that's it we got it that is that's the language
guys let's take that so they took that and they made him a king they poured money into that they
weaponized it next thing you had anders brave it goes and literally in in 2011 in norway goes and
massacres 77 people you know he's a neo-nazi terrorist he was inspired by the great replacement theory
you didn't you know you got the christ church killings in new zealand so this these theories mosque
was attacked and the worshippers were gunned down yes yeah so this is you're you're talking about
this stuff has real world consequences it's not it's not just a joke it's not just ideas these are
these are ideas that are literally tearing us apart and they're inspiring people to take up arms
against ordinary people around them so you know it's it's pretty frightening time that's the that's the
power of of this machine that is actually that's how it's getting out there and and i think look we can
sense it in the culture like you know nafiz you and i have known each other many years and over
the course of those years there are certain ideas that were once fringe and i want to cite some of
them things like the notion of there being a civilizational clash between islam and the west
you know when i was at university doing my undergraduate degree these were ideas that were being touted and
viewed as fringe and out there and actually unhistorically uh you know verifiable that they
were just sort of spin effectively or the notion that muslims are incompatible with the west you know
that we don't that we can never truly belong here those were fringe ideas being pushed by
racists but now you'll hear people say to you you know islam doesn't really belong in the uk you'll hear
people say you know well you know i am concerned about the demographic threat of muslims people will
say this in casual conversation and you and i also know that the brexit campaign which obviously nigel
farage who leads the reform party here in the uk which by the way is topping the polls currently if
there was an election tomorrow uh the predictions are that they would win those elections um that party
had if you remember in its pro brexit campaign a picture of syrian refugees uh appearing to flood
europe um when of course that was not they were not coming to the uk in any case um and they were
just fleeing war um so to what extent would you say and if you could point out some of these ideas
that there are things that these people have been pushing now for decades that we've all now
internalized as just standard it's just normal way to think about things yeah absolutely i mean i
think the main i think so obviously the the spectre of immigration right the idea that all our problems
fundamentally because of this massive movement of people right and these so obviously you can
you know people who look at this on its face is like oh the immigration i'm not saying immigration
is not something we need to think about of course obviously we have to think about it there should be
there should be policies around it um but the way in which this has been couched it suggests that
there is there is an imminent demographic threat and that's responsible for all our problems if it's
the nhs if it's our energy system if it's you know the the economy is jobs it's all because of immigration
so that's a general idea right there's there are these people who are coming they're coming in
they're changing everything they're taking everything down so this is generalized fears right
and so when people are feeling and it's completely understandable why people are feeling deeply like
terrible about all the things going on people are living from from paycheck to paycheck wages are not
rising inflation is going through the roof it's still high despite the point percentage you know kind of
dip it's still really bad cost of living crisis is ongoing people are not experiencing any any
major improvements in quality of life if not if things are getting worse things are getting harder
right now when your people are feeling that level of anxiety that you know when someone comes in and
says well it's just about these immigrants you don't really know who these people are you might
not have had contact with them you don't really know you kind of just think well maybe that makes sense
then it's easy it's you know and it's just it's it's very memetic right these memes they just
land on your plate whether it's youtube whether it's instagram you watch something weird and you'll
be like yeah that kind of makes sense and there's this confluence of course between the attention
economy which is shrinking right we only have 15 seconds to understand complex issues so here's a
picture of an immigrant that'll be the problem and the proposition of these simplistic narratives
to what actually are also not necessarily complex problems in and of themselves because we're talking
about inequality driven by essentially hoarders you know i think instead of calling them billionaires
we probably should just say hoarders right these people who hoard money on a huge scale and in so
doing they deprive the majority of people you know of a fair wage of you know access to basic services that
all humans require and you're saying that these ideologies provide the sort of um pseudoscientific
justification for why the world is the way it is why gardens deserve to die why poor people and
handicapped people should just be abandoned why would we spend money on looking after these people
and i think probably the same with the elderly actually to some extent it'd be interesting how
that develops in that sector well look at what's just happened here in the uk right elon mosk has come
in and one of the first things he does is he targets uk and he says that there and he literally
says that there is a mass rape crisis to do with muslims specifically and he weaponizes the grooming
gangs crisis which was obviously a horrifying scandal horrific scandal have to condemn yeah it has more
has to be done but what was he doing he weaponized it this is a guy with massive sexual assault allegations
against him like in tesla uh which which are not being dealt with you know there's there's there's some
evidence that he's you know that there's settlements going on behind the scenes all this kind of stuff
but no no he's he's the hero yeah and he's going to kind of white and knight in shining armor coming
in and total propaganda yeah so gp news he was amplifying propaganda from gb news which is part of
this network by the way yeah so gb news is one of the new networks that have propped up here in the uk
and have now almost overtaken some of the former uh legacy media channels in providing audiences with
these simplistic narratives around where we're at and gb news tell us a bit about the kind of the
background and where it fits into all of this so gb news um its main owner and funder is a guy called
christopher chandler and i did a story about this at byline where we exposed his very interesting history
having made most of his fortune saving gazprom which is russia's state-owned oil and gas company
back in the day a couple decades ago now so he saved gas from from crisis um he worked with um one of
putin's vladimir putin's closest confidants in doing that made loads of money um and then you know
decided that he's going to very generously support gb news and make a loss right and so we have to be
honest about media networks that are making a loss if you are funding a media network that is making a
loss you are involved in propaganda i mean because otherwise it's a commercial enterprise or it's a
public service there are only three options here you're involved in public service your commercial
enterprise out to make money or you're involved in propaganda where you are essentially making a loss
and accepting that i interrupted you on your point about musk but i do want you to continue on what
you were saying so what's interesting so gb news is obviously people are watching it you can see that
they they've been pushing these kinds of ideas for a while including great replacement theory ideas
very anti-muslim anti-immigrant stuff um pumping it out um and one of the things that they've been
putting out is this grooming gang stuff so this guy charlie peters um he basically um calls himself a
journalist and says that he's investigating all of this stuff he put out a disinformation thread
or on on x which elon musk anti-fly amplified i think got something like 24 million views
um and one of the core things that he claimed in that is he referred to this study and he said that look
at all the statistics with this study shows how disproportionately involved muslims are in grooming gangs
and so what i did is i actually looked into that study and not only was the study i mean he ended
up saying that one in 73 muslims in in rotherham for instance are done and he all caps one in 73 so you
can see what he's doing here he's clearly trying to demonize muslims and suggest that there's some
overwhelming propensity to be involved in this kind of horrific crime yeah so i looked at the the research
and obviously there was something odd about it because it it doesn't make sense like the actual data
shows overall with child sexual abuse that actually i mean and and this is anyone can look this up and
even sky news have been reporting other people but the data shows that there's no actual evidence of
any particular group being disproportionately represented in anything um it's most of the
perpetrators are are white that's not necessarily meaning anything because most people in britain are
white right so we don't need to make anything out of that yeah and only 29 at the moment of
of cases have ethnicity being recorded so there's poor data and the home office did a two-year study
and they said look we can't make conclusions about it yeah well he finds this obscure study
the study was not published in a peer-reviewed journal yeah um it was so peer-reviewed for people
who don't know what that means means your uh fellow academics look at your methodology and confirm that
you have used a sort of scientifically recognized means of coming to your conclusions that's right it's
it's basically it goes through this process of review by multiple experts who look at what you've
done and they say actually you know that's fair juice this is an argument you can hold it and if
they think there's weaknesses they feed back and you kind of tighten it up yeah so it didn't go through
that process at all yeah then i looked at the actual paper itself in in detail and to sum it up the paper
itself admits that the data that it uses doesn't really mean anything because they say all of the
data is based on was not based on actual court data and prosecutions it was based on media reports
media reports of prosecution so then they make this analysis and then they say well to be fair
we acknowledge that because our data is entirely from media reports it's quite possible that we
have ignored cases which involve white perpetrators which have not been covered in the media yeah and
that could mean that we are severely underestimating uh the number of white perpetrators and it could
also mean that there are other cases which are over representing in another direction but basically
because we don't know what the biases are it's completely unknown so we don't really know so it was like
okay if you don't know what the biases are your data and your conclusions are literally meaningless
because you don't know whether it's true or not so that that steady that that was circulating despite
that it's been it's turned into a meme so you know you've got the little ratio the one in 73
you know muslims are doing this that's been plastered everywhere it's now it's been amplified by
many people including academics like matthew goodwin um you know other people who've been putting it out
so it gives it this semblance of believability yeah so now you've got ordinary folks reading
coming across this stuff and thinking well that's that's that's terrible it's it's pure you have proof
well muslims are overrepresented in this this is a real threat it's a real problem there's something
wrong with this with muslims yeah and that becomes a generalized thing even though it's total
is total nonsense yeah it's not based on anything yeah and of course that's a narrative around muslims
being uh you know allegedly more violent more prone to sexual violence um that we find again
repeated in other circumstances so it's for example the narrative that helped justify the notion that the
assault that israel has committed against gaza was justified because they were out here committing
rape even though the public prosecutor in israel themselves have not identified cases that they're
pursuing of sexual violence in that setting so we then have these narratives about muslims being
these evil dangerous sexually you know crazed barbarians that seep into the analysis of every
single instance in which it serves us to demonize the quote unquote other um i was wondering how much
you'd noticed some of those ideas seeping into the way in which uh gaza and what israel's been doing to
gaza has been represented in the media so i think what's i think we've we're all experiencing i think
this this uh concerted dehumanization process from from watching what's been going on in gaza it's
incessant like like everyone i know feels traumatized and in fact whether it doesn't matter whether you're
jewish or muslim or whatever you are right just that the stuff that is coming out is so traumatic
but one of one of the consistent themes of it that is so disturbing it's become normal to see
people who look muslim be completely obliterated on your screens every day it's just normal it's
just what's happening that's just happening that's just you know how it is yeah the photos of gaza
looking like a total apocalypse yeah is like well it's just a war isn't it that's just war that's in
fact one of the arguments they use i've heard you know uh public pundits say it you know well this is
what it is it's war it's it's it's astonishing and i think you know this seeing this on our on our on
our phones and our tvs day in and day out is um is has has i think it's degrading our collective
consciousness like our ability to make moral judgments about the disgusting abnormality of this
scale of violence it's it's totally different like if you go back to iraq like we will remember
the iraq war right and the way it was then we didn't see it it wasn't in our faces in that way
right there were things that leaked and horrified the world but you know we did not see day in day
out for 16 months pictures of real time absolute horrific and i think that's what's that's what's so
different and weird about what's happening it's that it's just we're seeing it every day it's in our
faces and it's brazen and i think that's what really worries me about that is is it's almost like
it's it feels like it's normal if it's normal to exterminate a population in that way and to just
completely obliterate them and to destroy where they live and all of that stuff what is the implications
for us here what does that mean or for other you know groups around the world who are deemed to be
not worthy of life or clothing or shelter or medical assistance or humanitarian law or whatever
else um i want to ask you about this connection between the conservative libertarian ideals of
these techno bros and these fascistic nazi groups think tanks individuals because i was um at a festival
not burning man um where i was listening to a leading uh tech bro speaking with a government
official about regulation regulation of the tech industry and what struck me most in the conversation
was that this individual who i won't name was so brazenly arrogant in the conversation that he was almost
laughing at the idea that this government official representing the uk government's uh body for
specifically regulating the tech industry he was mocking them and sort of saying listen we know who
you know that in this case it's definitely the tail wagging the dog aka the tech industry is guiding
everything you do you people are always you know 10 years behind us we teach you how to use the tech
okay so the idea that you're going to regulate us please and in a private conversation he shared that
um you know the he and a group of people that he was with you know they're working towards an alternative
system outside of government regulation so tell us a bit about the sort of libertarian ideals of these
techno bros and where they align with people like musk and now trump so one of the things that's obviously
clear is that you know you've got the you got the european union you got britain even in america there
were you know there were legislative moves to start regulating tech a lot more and this was
obviously linked to things that have happened even even the riots last year you know britain
and in europe people were like what the hell has just happened i mean you don't must signal boosting
these fascists people coming out on the streets we can't allow this to keep going on this is nuts
yeah so there's been this legislation right it's primarily now you know pro after you know america
has now been taken over by the trump faction you know it's britain and europe which are now leading
that regulatory charge right yeah ironically those are the places where now you know musk and all of
his buddies are looking and saying we need to really sort those guys out you know we need to do something
about those guys so that's not an accident they don't want to be regulated in that way but that desire
for no regulation is rooted in in some of these same ideas and where you get this weird overlap it
starts with this really strange ideology called long termism which is this very techno utopian ideology
and one of the key guys behind it is a fellow called nick bostrom um who was used to be oxford
university his future of humanity institute was funded by elon musk okay um you know musk read loads of his
books and blurb them and loves his stuff so nick bostrom um he wrote this the founding kind of charter
of what long-termism is and it's kind of eugenics it refers to eugenics kind of openly talks about
this idea of different populations even nick bostrom himself wrote a paper about these uh you know the
idea that in the future we're going to have to have we're going to have this technology to choose um
to make decisions about cognitive enhancement and stuff at birth um and and if we think that the you
know the babies are not going to be clever enough you know we can we can we can stop that in utero
yeah um so he was advocating these soft eugenics soft eugenics ideas i mean they're pretty hard
eugenics from my point of view um it then emerged a couple of years later or very recently that he
actually bought into the kind of charles murray bell curve world view because he actually sent an
email on the listserv and it was leaked where he um referred very directly to the idea that black
people are stupid and white people so he actually buys these ideas hook line and sinker so this is
evidence that in the public domain what you've just said this email of him referring to
and i've described in the book it's all this is really well documented so you know so he was he's
kind of having these ideas so long-termism kind of built on this idea right didn't you know like it's
and it basically says that in the future you know the future evolution of humans is going to be driven
with ai and machines and at some point or other um humans are going to merge with machines and we're
going to upload our minds into the cloud and once we upload our minds into the cloud we're going to be
having these kind of digital playgrounds and eventually we're going to become a multi-planetary
species we're going to go into space and we're going to colonize all these planets but there's
going to be so many of us um we're going to need planet-sized servers and computers um which are
powering all of this and there'll be trillions of humans digital humans living happily in their
virtual reality paradises and they're going to expand across the universe and this is the future
it's going to happen this is going to happen but there might be catastrophic risks that derail that
meteor strike maybe climate change we're not worried about climate change we're more worried about
um unproductive poor people so for instance one of these long-termists like his guy his name is
william mccaskill he wrote about how um you know where should we do out what is effective altruism
right what is the best way to donate money so effective altruism is another movement linked to the
long-termists right we're going to be really um effective in our in our in our selflessness so how
do we do this so ironically they do this a deep philosophical analysis and they're like well you know
what if we give money to poor people in africa that's not going to really help people because
all that's going to do is stop those poor africans from being poor for like five minutes yeah um so
what we really should do is give more money to rich productive white people who are producing all
these amazing technologies and they're the frontier they're going to push humanity forward because
that's really good for everybody so so actually effective altruism means give more money to white
people and more money to tech bros and don't worry about uh poor people and black people and brown
trickle down economics this is classic trickle down economics surely right it's just invest at
the top and like people at the bottom will benefit i mean shame on them for not working harder you know
they should just work their way out of the slums and then they could also succeed isn't it weird how
it all kind of makes sense right exactly like you know you've got this bizarre techno utopian ideology
mingling with trickle-down economics mingling with this welfare state stuff mingling with eugenics
but it all they all kind of fit together like a bit of a jigsaw yeah and you can come at it with
the part that you like the most yeah so if you're maybe you might not like that part but you go with
the welfare state stuff and the fact we shouldn't have one yeah and then you might see those kind of
crazy long-termist guys you might say well they're at least they're helping me they're putting money
into my campaign yeah i don't know if i believe everything they're saying but that underlying
ideology this is where it gets really terrifying is because they believe that progressive causes
diversity equity inclusion anything to do with giving money towards so-called unproductive
inferior people is terrible and is a catastrophic risk they think that you can pretty much just do
anything to ensure that those things don't happen yeah and they see democracy which is the vehicle of
those things as a real threat so they want to dismantle democracy and this is not like this is not
just a speculative thing it's not a theory you just have to go and read what they're saying one of the
biggest proponents of this is a guy called curtis yavin curtis yavin is another tech bro funded by
peter teal he's in silicon valley and he's kind of come up with this theory called the dark
enlightenment that was his whole thing right he says a lot of different weird things but one of
the things that is most significant i think to bring up today yeah is he came up with this idea that
we should create you know democracy is a problem for all of these reasons that we described so what do
we replace it with we should replace it with a patchwork of mini sovereignties and these
mini sovereignties are to be controlled by kind of these individual so-called sovereign individuals
who are basically tech bros right with tons of money and these these mini sovereignties
will run without any concern for the opinion of residents who live there they're going to be run by
entirely by you know the person who owns that territory so they want to smash democracies
into this patchwork of these mini sovereign sovereign sovereign territories which are run by
these massive to this new technological oligarchy you know these these huge billionaire behemoths all
hail king musk and that's why there's this there's this weird interest in taking over greenland
because peter teal wanted has talked about this idea of going into greenland and setting up a weird
silicon valley like crypto city right and that's one that's the beginning of this kind of structure
that they want to start creating and succeeding all over all over the world so that's that's one of the
visions that we've got whereas this very deliberate vision of we need to take down and dismantle
democracies and replace them with this new techno authoritarian structure nafiz um it's difficult
to hold on to any optimism when we are hearing just how deep we are in uh you know the confluence of
interest between really nefarious actors um a recent study here in the uk found that um today
a majority of gen z's uh more than half want a dictatorship with everything you've studied with
everything you know what is or what are some of the essential parts of the fight back of the pushback
what do people need to know what do they need to understand and what should we all be doing
to push back against this authoritarian fascist takeover or the alt reich as you put it so i think
the first thing is to just to is to remember that and things are going to get worse right the things
are going to get crazy in the next few years exactly things are going to get nuts um but what we need
to remember is that what these people want to do cannot work it can't work it's not based on reality
and not just in the long term even in the short term it's going to it's not going to work and we
already saw this right trump came in 2016 tried to do all his stuff and you know then reality happened
pandemic happened other stuff happened and people got fed up and they've got rid of him right now
obviously they they are trying to get to a point where they can make structures more authoritarian but if
you look at all the things they want to do or they want to deport 20 million migrants
they want to take out two trillion dollars in the federal budget they're literally dismantling
fundamental infrastructure of american government which runs the country what my account just the
conventional calculations were like that's 7.5 percent of gdp from from from just throwing out um
undocumented migrants um that's colossal like that's like a sucker like a sucker punch to the economy yes
when i look to you take the whole plan in together and look at the tariffs and stuff as well everything
that they're doing it's like 25 of gdp is just going to crush just disappear so you really destroy
the american economy i don't think americans are going to sit there and just be like yeah that's
fine you know especially you know as long as they can identify who the enemy is well they i think
they're going to realize that's that point that this is this is something that trump and musk are doing
like they're the ones actually dismantling everything there's only so far you can you
can go before people are like yeah i might hate the migrants i might hate all of them lot but this is
crazy yeah you're destroying my actual life reality is is that when these guys come in they they do not
understand the economy they don't understand how to do politics yeah they're going to destroy everything
so they are going to tear things down they're going to they're going to they're going to go to town um
but what it means is that they can't win ultimately they can't actually succeed what we need to do is i
think in that context is two things one we need to be ready to be able to explain to people the reality
of what is going on because right now people don't get it people are confused people are so disoriented
by and that's part of the plan part of their the plan is just disorient people keep just go crazy
it's like the madman theory that richard nixon implemented just just act insane and and people
are like people can't respond in time and there are no facts anymore anyway so yeah exactly so and
people and people don't know what to believe so what we need to do is is kind of educate ourselves
and be able to empower people with understanding first of all what is going on what are these people
really about what what are they really trying to do and we really need to up our game there we need
to just get rid of this liberal wishy-washy rubbish about maybe the far right is like this is fringe
no no no this is serious this is that's why the subtitle of the book is a network war to destroy the
west from within there's there's there is a war underway and we need to kind of wake up and be like
that's what's happening guys we need to fight for democracy so that's the one so one part of is
understanding the reality and really getting that out there so people can see it this the second
thing is um we need to be ready to um just drop the liberal wishy-washy let's tinker along with the
current system and kind of keep it going you know the way in which biden harris ran the campaign the
campaign the way in which keir starm is currently doing things yeah this is also not going to work
and that's part of the problem we're in this weird era of swing politics where
voters are looking at the liberal incumbents and they're just saying this is totally boring and
uninspiring if if not semi-genocidal uh or full genocidal and i can't buy into this and then so
they think well those he's saying let's tear everything down i'm i'm all for tearing everything
down right so and then and then you tear everything down it's like well that was terrible let me go back
to the to the liberals who are slightly more sane and that's obviously not palatable so what we need to do
is we need to accept that we need systemic transformation we need radical systemic change
um and we're going to have to do that one way or another like yeah it depends
when and we need to get there now so we need to focus on creating and and elevating and amplifying
the kind of the the real visions for the future and where we could be yeah and these are not pie in the
sky thing what we need to be doing is ensuring that we that we that we don't save dying industries but
save people so move and retrain workers to move into these booming emerging sectors which are going to
take over don't be mired in this backwards thinking the reform is coming in with their climate denialism
and nigel farage turned up at the heartland institute launch in the uk the heartland institute is another one
of these mad right-wing climate science denial organizations lobby groups funded by the same
nexus of foundations we talked about before yeah and that's what he is so this is this is this is
catastrophic so let's let's not vote for arjun yeah you know let's try and avoid that yeah and let's
let's kind of really empower these inspiring visions of what is possible and get people behind that because
there is a possible optimistic future there waiting for us and it's it's coming our way
inexorably or what we need to do is latch onto it and empower it wonderful dr nafiz ahmed thank you so
