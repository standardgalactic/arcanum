hello everybody i hope i hope you can hear us um welcome from the citizens to our virtual event
a warning to america 2073 and the arrival of techno authoritarianism so we're going to be in
conversation for a bit and then if you have questions we'll take them in the chats we're
going to show you a clip of the film uh quite early on um but uh and yes let me say this at the
starts there is a website 2073.film which has got much more information about all of this
um but let me introduce this amazing panel that we have here so it's such a huge pleasure to be
among friends um all of these people very special uh great friends and colleagues um who i am just
very honored to know actually um so i am going to start with maria resa who is won a nobel peace prize
which was quite an astounding moment um she is a former cnn bureau chief she set up a very innovative
um news website in the philippines rappler and uh as some of you might know she came under incredible
attack in from 2016 when president duterte came to power and singled her out and um she was fighting
for her life for many years and we will hear more about that we also have rana ayub who is joining us
from bombay rana is an incredible investigative journalist who has done remarkable work um has gone
undercover deep investigations into corruption and many of the people she investigated are very close
to modi and as a result of this she found herself very personally targeted and um has come under attack
in similar ways as maria through legal actions and through online assaults and rana you also see her
work in the washington post where she's an opinions columnist and then it's uh we have really delighted
joining us is asif kapadia who is one of britain's leading filmmakers um who we're here because of his
length of work 2073 but you may know him from previous documentaries including the amazing amy which uh won an
oscar a few years ago um so i want to just with the three of you you know we're here today because
i think many people when when asif first started showing his documentary at screenings um earlier last
year it what it did seem like science fiction to people i mean that's as you'll talk about is the frame
of the film he's he's done this very clever thing of setting it in the future in 2073 but using footage
from the present day to create this atmosphere of dystopia and using both documentary and also
dramatic scenes and i think asif can talk about this but i think some of his film executives found it
far-fetched and unlikely and you know a distant sort of dystopian dream and i think even now it
seemed that since the election people are really seeing how actually this future which is based upon
the collision of both authoritarian and populist leaders and the technology surveillance tools and the
power of social media to corrupt the truth those have now we are seeing those coming together in real time
and we thought you know we're now we're only five days away from the inauguration of donald trump
and the elevation of elon musk the richest man on the planet who controls one of the most powerful
communication communication tools the world has ever seen becomes part of the global superpower and the
way that that power can be used to target people to influence opinion to corrupt and absolutely destroy
even the concept of truth and facts we really felt that it is the people who we really need to be
attending to and listening to are the likes of maria and rana who have been there who have seen it who
are living it they have lived are living with techno authoritarianism and the things that they have
learned through the last years are really critical things which we felt people in america
um especially those who are going to be on the front line public officials journalists lawyers all of
those people are going to be amongst the first targeted so that's the idea of why we've come together
today and i think uh ben if it if we could play the clip now the trailer and then we will go to
questions from the three here if that's okay
i hope someone finds this the event wasn't just one thing it was a slow creek
no one said or did anything to stop them
it's our memory they want to wipe out
this year 72 percent of the world is under authoritarian rule we're now in a democratic
recession and it's endemic in europe in the united states india the philippines
minorities silenced dissenters arrested social media cooperative we are worth more when we are
addicted polarized and disinformed than if we are living breathing free citizens
we're in new san francisco have you visited
if you don't have facts you can't have truth without truth you can't have trust
we have faced wars and famines and genocides but this is bigger than any of that
it's too late for me may not be too late for you
oh gosh as if that music gets me every time i find it very emotional even just watching the trailer there
um maria can i kick off with you i think what when we i think i messaged you shortly after the um
trump's victory and you the thing that you said so clearly which sort of really sticks with me which
is you were just it just happened so fast and i think to explain to the audience so in 2016
rodrigo duterte took power this was it was interesting it was just before uh brexit happened
and maria can you just explain what happened next and how the philippines went from
you know a sort of vibrant democratic state to something else i mean it's it's really simple
because you're seeing it it's happened all around the world now um
um uh we didn't disagree on the facts leading up to the elections of rodrigo duterte facebook played
an incredible role in that um he uh is the first social media president and then what happened was
the growth algorithm polarized our society if you were pro duterte you move further right if you're
anti duterte further left it's the friends of friends algorithm was the first thing and then what
happened was that um he had a brutal drug war um estimates of how many people killed ranged anywhere
from what the police said which is 8 000 to 30 000 which is what our commission on human rights say so
you have this instance of no one knows what the truth is the facts are debatable and then you have fear
and violence uh as part of it and you had a very strong man leader who was in charge we have a
constitution that's patterned after the united states three branches of government i would say and this is
pretty much what we've lived through right um within six months rodrigo duterte became the most powerful
leader we've ever had because you had the institutions collapse and what what is scary about this moment in
time um is that you have president elect trump coming in in a few days you said uh he is uh he now
understands the way government works he's actually appointed people who are more loyal far more loyal and
they and there is a plan so it isn't far-fetched it may even be faster than the six months it took in
the philippines um i won't leave you completely depressed about six months because look the philippines
we were in hell and now we're in purgatory so you can move but it feels to me like other countries
like the one we're talking about is just moving to hell
oh thanks maria um rana can i come to you now and can we talk about in particular the relationship
between the tech companies and between an authoritarian government which is what you have
in india and how you've seen that play out the interaction between these two things and and where
that's led well absolutely i think this is uh this is a pattern with authoritarian regimes across the
world where tech companies have been enablers uh for instance the kind of islamophobia that elon musk
is is kind of stoking right now you know with robinson and everybody that is being cited as an example
on indian twitter yes elon musk has become like the new hero right and and there is so much
misinformation that i feel like the entire indian election has been fought around misinformation
and disinformation like one i'll give you one classic example when uh when uh when the head of
the nobel committee was in india he said something and his statement was twisted to say that modi is
the top contender for the nobel peace prize every news channel played it right including the ministers
and the top ministers pray that modi is the top contender for the nobel peace prize till the
till the till the till there was a clarification issue thing no no such statement was made but by
then that statement had become the truth the fact checkers who are in india right now uh it's a very
niche community right uh and they are under attack right now the fact checking websites are under attack
there are cases against alt news and um journalists who are doing the fact checking journalists like us have
their tweets being removed and elon musk who's a free speech you know he calls himself like oh i'm a
i'm somebody who supports free speech is absolutely fine with the indian government removing content
off twitter which is criticizing him he's absolutely fine with indian government taking down tweets which
are critical of the modi government during the farmers protest or during all sorts of protests in india
so the the the you know the app so i think we are looking at a problem because elon musk has publicly
you know spoken about his love for narendra moody government about you know the right wing in india
is obsessed with the elon musk kind of um you know a strong man kind of a personality who's out here to
end the woke culture which is out here to destroy us um they identify with him and you know this is i think
the fact that i'll give you a personal example you know that um i was doxed um two months ago all my
details were out on social media there is an ai generated porn image right there on the internet
my visa my passport my gmail passwords my bank account passwords were all put out on the internet
till today it has not been removed and twitter says it does not violate its privacy policy that's what
twitter says right and the people who have given me explicit rape and death threats these are people
followed by the prime minister of india the guy who put my ai generated porn image is followed by the
prime minister of india and after i point him out that this guy has doxed me he says okay go ahead and
see what you can do with it i thought i thought twitter nothing happens so this is the future as maria
rightly pointed out this is the future we are looking at when the institutions meant to protect us
are looking the other way that's what happens in authoritarian regimes right in india we have seen
the elections are like it's not a level playing field the various the various institutions that are
meant to safeguard the world's largest democracy have collapsed and with technology companies tech
companies now completely frustrating before these authoritarian leaders we are looking at a very very
bleak future ahead oh thanks rana so asif i want to go to you now because this film is a long time in
the planning and it's a sort of extraordinary um accident of timing isn't it that it's coming out just now
and you actually chose to put these tech bros the broligarchs as i'm trying to call them anyway in the
film so you've got elon musk is in there peter teal is in there jeff bezos is in there and can you talk
about how this came about and how you sort of brought these strands together and and you know and talk
about some of the difficulty i know that you've had in terms of making this film and and and why it's felt
so important to you first of all like amazing to be here with you all as part of this to kind of for
the film kind of comes full circle where i did a series of interviews with each of you started in
lockdown you know this film has been in my head a long time i started it around 2020 spoke to rana and
carol both of you you know we're all at home or in apartments or in hotel rooms or somewhere i met maria
in paris i came out to meet maria in paris um and so the idea of all of you coming together and talking
is like a dream come true in a way um and that's why i wanted to make the film though i wanted to
make the film because of my own experience of just existing okay my family are from india i was aware
of what was happening in gujarat that's where my family are from so i was aware of modi for a long time
and yet all i kept reading was the world's greatest democracy is going to elections and i never saw
anything in the uk talking about but what's happening in india what happens constantly
no one looked into like the latest kind of communal riots and violence that was happening and and what
was happening to people including friends of mine who are actors who were very much afraid who a lot
of them are cons were told you know you got to know your place okay you may well be the biggest movie
stars in bollywood but you know your place and there was a lot of things that were not being talked
about i've worked in brazil i was aware of what was happening in brazil before bolsonaro came to power
where young people wanted a strong man to come into power to clean up all the mess right and
older people who lived with a military dictatorship who i worked with were saying no my dad was locked
up by the military this is not a good thing you don't want a strong person to come along who just
gets rid of laws and just says do what i say bring in the military i was in the us during the election
in 2016 and really your writing carol on brexit was like the first time where someone had put
something down and i thought i'm not crazy you know what i was feeling and seeing you wrote about
because you said something's going on with facebook and our data is being used and i immediately stopped
using facebook um and so for me the film starts with like all of these things that i was seeing as i
was traveling and working around the world came together through what happened in the uk with brexit and
seeing racists on tv every week every night on the on the bbc not being questioned for their views
and and somehow being balanced out by the presenter and let in justifying what they were saying and then
seeing it happen in the us seeing it in brazil seeing in europe and just thinking is it me or is
it happening everywhere at the same time and at the time when our government particularly here in the uk
kept saying people are tired of experts i like experts i think experts are great let's talk to
experts you are all experts in your field and i basically thought i'm going to make a film i don't
know what it is yet or how i'll pull it off but i'll interview lots of experts and listen to them and
then i'll figure out how to tell a story because i think filmmaking works in a certain way it can it can
hit you emotionally visually in a way that it's hard when it's an article if you don't read that
particular newspaper if you don't subscribe to that particular website or you're not going to read
an entire novel so i was like my job was how can i put this all together and frame it in a way that
i can get an audience that is different and also globally because it's all connected that's what i
was feeling and all of our conversations showed me and and confirmed that you have to understand
something happening in asia is coming your way you can't just say it's not my problem and and that
was really where the movie came from but i also feel my job as a filmmaker is how can i sell this
to an audience and genre is a classic way people like horror films they like action movies they like
sci-fi i'll give you a sci-fi but it's all based on fact that was the thing so i also wanted to do it
by playing with the form of filmmaking so i've got drama i've got documentaries that the you know people
think it's a horror film when they watch it but it's all based on truth it's a horror we are living
and we came up with this kind of term that came out of um one of the people i interviewed douglas
rushkoff the event we're in the event this changing of time from what we used to know to where we're
heading we're in the middle of it and it's happening gradually but also really fast and so that was the
idea i i my my job was to kind of bring all of you together into a movie and people may know maria
or they may know rana but they may not know someone carol or they may not know all of you and
my job is how can i use you all in a way to kind of spread the word so more people are aware of
what's going on and to see the links between us all thank you asif and that's for me what i love
about the film is this you know we we're sort of writing these dry journalistic pieces we're trying
to sort of get this across to an audience but it's really hard and it's so complicated and you know
what i love about the film is that what the fact that you do take us on this emotional journey and
samantha morton her face is just so emotional and the music is so emotional and and that does feel
like something different that nobody's done before um can i go to you know actually one thing which some
people have said to me in the last few days is that watching the la fires has been a sort of moment of
like oh this i didn't i just see this in 2073 and maria i mean maybe you can talk about this because
what's been so fascinating just watching it you know at a distance i'm not watching it closely or
attentively but you can see this collapse of truth in real time and the idea of any kind of like
established facts um just isn't that you know that that has now gone and the way that in particular
we're seeing elon musk amplify that and the conspiracy theories take hold even while you
know the city is still burning it you know you couldn't have a more dramatic illustration really
of what's happening could you and literally for power and money right like the disinformation narratives
or misinformation lit is is acceded precisely to give someone power look um let me take what as if
said as if was quoting doug rushkoff saying we're 50 and i'd say we're 80 in this is something that we
are living through and i would say you know the the manipulation began as early as 2014 there was
immediate global impact because it was the annexation of crimea the same meta narrative that was
used eight years later to actually invade ukraine itself right here in the philippines we watched
sorry in the philippines we watched um history change in front of our eyes carol you broke the
cambridge analytica story and and even at that point if you remember chris wiley said when they
when they created cambridge analytica by the time the 2016 elections were ready in the us they had a
facebook page in every single county in america that was targeting young men fast forward that to
the results of the of the 2024 elections so let's go to the la fires i mean look people's lives this is
something we've lived through in the philippines because we have an average of 20 typhoons every year
people lose their homes it is a disaster people lose their lives right but what we're seeing is that there
are now in those critical moments when you need your information to be 100 accurate impossible on
social media the way it's designed today right um you still have the the tech companies big tech
literally saying this is opportunistically a way i can make money these platforms have moved from
being a tool of connection into weapons of mass behavioral engineering and that's partly what you
see in the film but they're not neutral they're sophisticated systems that are designed to exploit
our deepest psychological vulnerabilities they monetize outrage and hate they amplify divisions
and systematically erode our capacity for nuanced thinking and empathy which is what you need in a
disaster right and the irony of course is that fires the la fires are connected with climate change which
is one of the facts that isn't a fact um and then you go right back to this the business model of of
of tech big tech surveillance capitalism again we know this from shoshana zuboff is built on this
fundamental betrayal of fundamental betrayal of human dignity data privacy is a myth ai and algorithms have
cloned and manipulated us and i think you know as we look at these fires and you look at how the
firefighters and the california governor gavin newsom it was exacerbated and made worse significantly worse
by influencers and i'm going to put rabbit ears and far-right influencers that were using it to attack
those who literally have to get the work done and yet have to spend time which in moments like that
can mean the difference between life and death dealing with disinformation right this is only one of
those anyway not to be so bleak about it but that is this moment that shows you everything wrong and of
course when did that what happened right in time for that was mark zuckerberg's announcement that he
would throw facts out the window uh that profit would win and the a new kind of content moderation well never
use those words anymore now because it could be used politically um but now you can be harmful
practices that we what you live through rana what carol live through what i live through where free
speech is used to pound you to silence i've been told to chill out a little bit i'm chilling you know
literally can pound you to silence and make you believe um things you shouldn't believe here's the last
part there's a great book you know i'm teaching disinformation at columbia university this semester and
um a great book by dan arieli it's called misbelief he doesn't come at it from tech or information he
comes at it from the way you feel from people from sociology and he says anything that is a stressful
instance something that's unplanned stress that you cannot explain that you then become far more
vulnerable to believe in conspiracy theories um than at any other time we're living through these
stressful moments and of course there's no better moment than the pandemic that sets the stage for
where we are today thanks maria um just a little reminder if you've got questions do you put them
in the chat and we're going to try and get to them um rana i want to come to you there's um somebody else
who's in the film and apple bam who you know recently published this book autocracy inc which is such
a clear sort of explanation of the way that these autocrats and authoritarians across the world
are all networked together are supporting each other are copying each other a sort of supplying
resource and i was really struck rana because when i spoke to you after the trump election
you said that it had already got worse it had already made modi and his supporters had given them
to permission it felt like to act even more aggressively and i just wondered if you could talk about
that this sort of the idea that this playbook is something which is copied and leapfrogs from place
to place and as it goes sort of it's always exponentially getting worse really absolutely it's
not that joe biden was any better when it comes to when it came to kind of criticizing narendra modi i mean
he he he gave the state he he made him the state guest he gave state honors from narendra modi but the
thing is that with with joe biden the the modi led dispensation so uh feared that the committees in
the u.s which was talking about democracy we spoke about protecting the rights of religious minorities
at least there were reports like that that would come out of the u.s right um the u.s also came out
with a report on the targeted killing of civilians transnational killing of indian critics in canada i mean
there were reports by the doj the u.s also came out with multiple reports on uh the farmers protest
on and the attack of the muslim minorities in india so the modi government had been looking forward to
a trump administration simply because there's this major trump you know for me between trump and modi
modi has gone to houston said vote for trump trump has come to gujarat the home state of narendra modi
uh with melania and jared kushner in in the front row and and saying that this is the man these are
two men who believe that um they truly believe uh that the democracy is and is is not the right thing
that majoritarianism is the right thing and two leaders who are stroking victimhood uh in the majority
community who are stoking the fear of the others right like like the way trump stokes the fear of of
the migrants of people who are coming into united states modi despite the hindu majority being in
clear power is talking the fear of the muslim invader i mean i'm in mumbai which is the financial
capital of the country right which is where we have bollywood the big business houses and yesterday i was
in a car and there was massive hoardings that said the land is our the schools are our what are the
outsiders doing here what are the rohingyas doing here what are the bangladesh is doing here throwing
gas and bangladesh is our a dog whistle for muslims right and and now how do we get in tech this kind
of message also goes on social media on facebook for instance in india we have mob lynching on the
accusations of eating beef that mob lynching is now being live streamed on facebook and the guy who is like
literally the top vigilante or cow terrorists as we call them has got this gold me but i don't think
they could they get a gold membership from facebook i don't know gold button right there's got a gold
button from facebook and and and there's a report that says that facebook is monetizing these videos
promoting these videos in which a muslim man is being mob lynched live on camera on facebook with no checks and
balances the the entire angst against indian muslims so to say i think one of the major factors has been
facebook whatsapp instagram these are these are the places where hatred is stoked where fake news is
weaponized against the muslim minorities they're taking over your schools they're taking over your
resources they're taking over your education they're taking over the money they're taking over your
religious science right every day you hear fake news about oh this mosque has a temple beneath it
these are people and well-meaning people are believing this because the thing is maria often
poets out has pointed out in the past that when you when you repeat a lie a thousand times right
it ends up becoming truth for people you know there is you you're being bombarded with it
so uh i think with trump coming to power i think you know everybody thought that modi receiving um
a reduced majority would kind of you know dent his popularity i don't see that i'm very cynical
i i think we are ready for i don't think in the india should think of a future where we are going to
have a free and fair election free and fair operation operational democracy and with trump in power
there are a lot of indian dissidents indian critics who said possibly the powerful countries in the world
could keep a check-in balance but with trump in power what kind of check-in balance are we really
looking at you know we are looking at a bon homie of a bromance between all the dictators with tech
imperialism also so i think uh i think i think at the receiving end will be those people uh critics
journalists and the minorities and i think journalists already seen that some of the best journalists in
india are either independent journalists or are behind bars or are being killed there was one
journalist who was killed two weeks ago in india so i think again i i really think that asif's film has
come at at probably it's it's realistic it's not been dystopian that future that he talks about in 2073
is almost here upon us trump is just it's just right it just feels so sudden as well as right
you know can i can i jump in there because i think this thing which is so this is one of the
communalities we see in in in several different countries in india it's in britain it's in america
but the targeting of muslims as the out group who become the hate group who and and very much i think
this is that this is where often the first attacks land and the thing which interests me and asif i'd like
to go to you here because this actually having this personal experience of technology being used to
surveil you personally being personally profiled and targeted it does give you a really different
visceral understanding of this world and the way that this technology which can be great but can also
be weaponized against individuals and you you have got this background you know of you've actually
lived with this experience haven't you for more than a decade now can can you just sort of talk
about that and how that experience led you also into your understanding of this subject yeah sure i mean
i can talk about because you know it happened and most people you know you think you're just being
paranoid but what happened in my case is it was confirmed to me i um was in the us i was in new
york i was working on a film um i was there for meetings because it was a film project i had a
driver you know i had an itinerary so i'm i'm i'm being driven to jfk tell us the year it's post 9 11.
so you know a lot of everything sort of changes there's two key things from everyone i spoke to
like the financial crisis which leads to austerity which means you need to have someone else to blame
and you always look punch downwards and then 9 11 was like a key point so yeah it was after 9 11.
i'm in new york a few a year or two after i'm working there as i'm leaving manhattan i'm in a limo
it's the most gorgeous sunset over manhattan i'm on the brooklyn bridge and i'm taking photos looking
out the window of manhattan with a sunset the driver is watching me in his rearview mirror again you look
suspicious don't like the look of you why are you taking a photograph of new york and reports me to
homeland security so when i arrive at the airport i'm in the lounge and my name is called that in the
whole of jfk like not just like one the whole of jfk make yourself known so i make myself known
thinking i've left a bag that looks suspicious or something but then five people turn up in the lounge
of uh i was in business class and in front of everyone they unload my bag they take out everything
they take my cameras they take everything i've got ask me what i'm doing why i'm there and it's quite
scary it's quite awkward um you know there were people there ready to deport me and do various
things in the end i could show who i was and why i was there i'm a film director i mean you know i have
a lot of backup to say who i am i don't have a big beard i can speak english you know if i had looked
a certain way or sounded a certain way i was wearing religious clothes maybe in a whole different
experience but i explained it i'm trying to make gags saying you know which um cop movies do you
guys all like because i'm trying to figure out what is going on here and then they pretty much i
asked them what happened what have i done and they told me you know someone said you look suspicious
and i remember the look of the driver watching me all the way through that drive and i remember
you know when someone's watching you in a funny way they're not just driving and so they told me
there was no problem i fly home but for the next 10 15 years after that every time i went to the us
i would be stopped two or three times before i got on a plane i'd be stopped after i got off the plane
if i was on a shoot or on a film i had to get a letter from the head of the studio kind of saying
i'm the director of this feature film or i'm directing this shoot and everyone else would go
through and i'd always be held back and and some of those moments were quite scary when i got stopped
in houston and i was changing flights and you know i'm putting a room for a few hours and a guy
of a machine gun would come by every now and again and look at me and i'd look at him saying can i go
and he'd say have you got a problem and i go no i've not got problem because you look a bit sad you
sure you haven't got a problem i go no i'm absolutely fine you know and he was like he's got a gun and
he's watching me and trying to egg me on and that was normal for a while to a point where i stopped
going to the us for quite a long time so it happens right and then when you wrote the article in
the guardian where we i told this story the number of asian people that i know who got in touch
started saying happened to me happened to me exactly the same strip search that an airport
in front of all my friends you know that isn't unusual it happened to a lot of people and so that
all is how things and surveillance have changed post 9 11 is that everyone's on the watch list unless
you can prove you're not a terrorist and so yeah that that is something that a lot of people have
lived with and then when you see it happening more and more and getting closer and closer you
recognize it you know what's going on you know what it's like you know how it can be used against you
and of course everyone says well if you haven't done anything wrong no one would have stopped you
well actually i didn't do anything wrong you know i took a photograph of new york um but it that could
set you off for the next decade and you wouldn't even know that's the other thing isn't it is that
if you're if you get profiled in some way if the algorithm says no you're not necessarily going to
know why you're on the list and actually that's what comes across so well in the film isn't it that
the the that samantha morton in this case is the one who is targeted but did that i mean it's
is he going to use all of this in a film in a way beside if you don't know what you've done that's
illegal you know or it can be backdated as many of you will have experience of right you know and it
can be did you sign a particular petition or you know was it a particular book that you read or was it
because you went on that march and people photographed everyone on that particular march and now that's
it's illegal to do that which we witnessed a lot happening in this country as well where people
were saying certain marches you know you're not allowed to do that other marches are fine but you
can't be protesting about that but you can protest about that and this is all a part of the strange
world that we're living in which day by day becomes more and more kind of dystopian and confusing and
and you you are aware that our your freedom is being lost day by day and just just to jump in
there so the questions which samantha morton is asked in fact you saw a bit in the trailer there
of like where you come from but you know these questions and as if you said to me that those
were actually taken from interrogations of uyghur people in china is that right they're re-education
questions of the uyghurs in china yeah so we actually have the list and they're kind of well known and
we use them as as kind of questions that you hear during the film and then she herself ends up being
interrogated yeah so i think listen one of the key things about what we wanted to try and do here
is that it's it's not just enough to warn people of like is coming down the line
people are going to get targeted this is going to be really bad the the whole point is is that maria
and rana you two have shown incredible resilience in still standing still surviving still fighting
onwards and you know there must be so much so much that you've learned through that experience and
so much knowledge that you hold actually and you carol don't leave yourself out you've been through
all this absolutely thanks but the but the thing is i've done it in a country in which we have rule
of law and we haven't and that's the difference and and that frankly is the terrifying thing about america
now that a weaponized department of justice is a completely different paradigm which is what rana and
and maria both have experienced so that that thing is you know so go to you first maria which is maria
just to tell anybody on this panel maria is the most ridiculously cheerful optimistic upbeat enthusiastic
energizer bunny and it is unbelievable like i do not know how you do it maria so i think can you just
i mean this is just your personality i kind of think we can actually learn too much from this
but can you give us some of your sort of practical sort of bits of wisdom that you have learned along
the way so so like let me be with a sif in just pointing out carol you also came under intense attack
and the attack isn't just online it's also in the real world right that's the one thing online violence
is real world violence it has a psychological impact on you and when you say the uk has rule
of law well let's talk about and you know kleptocracy right we can so what i've learned in this whole
thing is that um if the gatekeeper that's the journalists in terms of our public information
ecosystem now the tech companies and then the countries and rule of law the people in charge of
actually implementing it if they do not implement it you don't have it if it's random then you do not
have rule of law and i think that's what we're seeing all around the world i think three quick
responses right the first is that do we have individual agency with social media with big tech
with generative ai the large language models we do not have agency right that is if you put it together
with the discipline of psychology behavioral economics and sociology um it is an attack at the cellular
level of democracy so that's the first the second is that as people where we have a you know the devil
and the angel on our shoulders we can be good we can be bad evil um the system we are swimming in
forces evil forces the worst of who we are as humanity it the incentive structure that used to be
to push us towards the good right this concept of name and shame you do not want to be named as a
misogynist oh no that doesn't work anymore right like there are really only two fracture lines in every
country around the world that have been pounded open they are gender and race and we have seen these
pop up in different ways right immigration inflation this is race um anyway so so that's the first the
worst of humanity so let me answer your question which is you know what do i do hope comes from action
and i guess that's the first part right we literally i have given up on on begging these tech companies
to put safety measures in place because we walked into a building that is falling down around us it is
not safe to be there right so what we've done in rappler and this is a few years ago we began building
tech i think around the time i began talking to asif right we need to have a public tech stack one where
you are not manipulated you are not attacked where it is safe to speak right it is no longer safe to
speak and and what we have now is we rolled this out it's we built a matrix protocol chat app and we
rolled it out a year ago and we are getting ready for elections in the philippines this year in may
right because you cannot have integrity of elections if you don't have integrity of facts if you don't
have people who can choose without being insidiously manipulated what a long response right so so really
it's not just our individual agency that that risk now it's also it is our i mean you can look at the
how how these tech companies have killed democracy move fast break things say mark zuckerberg right and you
we've watched his evolution in front of our eyes in many ways the mask has fallen off and uh he's
just decided profit is more important politics power in politics um i've seen uh business leaders in
the philippines bow to president duterte when he took office we're seeing the same things happen in
the united states but the ripple effect of the united states is far larger than the philippines
um so i think it's kind of interesting because your your your answer has touched on what's a few
people have asked in the chat which is so i like this the way this question has been worded though
which is that what does the what does the panel think is the best way to resist the brover lords
on our platform so thank you whoever coined that word some are leaving platforms some are leaving social
media ads do we stay do we risk do we leave the platforms and rana what's your view i noticed
today rana actually because i did a i put out a notice about the event and i was like oh rana isn't
on blue sky i couldn't find your handle but you are on twitter what's your yeah where are you on this
whole question of leaving or staying on twitter yeah leaving i'm saying i know asif has left twitter
i know we know that but i think you know i personally believe that as independent journalists
you know we have very little space left in democracies where the mainstream media has
completely the legacy media has completely prostrated before the modi government so we have
very little spaces to offer independent voices and the truth and unfortunately for us while twitter
is a platform which is censoring sensible voices and amplifying aid it is also a platform which is
giving access to independent journalists to post news items and snippets of lynching and stories i
don't want to cede space to this to these bigots for them to take over the entire narrative i don't think
i don't know if i'm doing the right thing or the wrong but i feel like i need to stay and do my bit
in in just putting out the stories that i report because there are very very few platforms left
how many indians would go to the washington post read my story they go to instagram or twitter or they
they want to know where am i publishing even something as basic as uh yesterday i saw something
about a muslim man being you know beaten on the streets right i don't there are no spaces so i just
tweeted about it that a muslim man was beaten on the street on the on the suspicion of
being bangladeshi you want these spaces to amplify these stories and get them help and also to kind
of for the world to know what is happening in india right because there is no way for the world to
understand what is happening in the world's largest democracy because outside of india we still think
oh this is gandhi's land they don't know what has happened to gandhi's land and we have to use the
social media to that you know to kind of amplify the real truth about india and especially in a
country where so much independent media in india has been captured hasn't it this sort of oligarchy
absolutely absolutely i mean we are just a handful of independent journalists and we can't just leave
social media to those people who are only spreading this information as if there's an interesting question
hear from somebody in the audience and saying but they're asking about whether you explored the
psychological dynamics of authoritarianism such as this is an interesting question how do individuals
justify their complicity or resistance and and the questions to the panel as well how do you what is the
suggestion to change compliance to resist from from compliance to resistance which is a very interesting
question because i think one of the you know um you're probably all aware of the tim snyder book on
tyranny we've all been that's been re-upped and this his first you know advice is this one which keeps
on coming up because we keep on seeing in action do not obey in advance what's so asif i don't know to
go to you enough question but i think you just answered it that's why i wanted to talk to the experts carol
how do you not obey in advance you've not obeyed in advance you've disobeyed you've disobeyed hollywood
you should be making some blockbuster and like why are you making so you you you decided not i've
always disobeyed in my own way i've always been i i come from a sort of background of hackney boy working
class not from private school didn't go to oxbridge didn't come from the arts and so any film is like
fighting a sort of establishment or a structure um and so i've always been interested in stories
about outsiders in a way or people fighting assistance so for me making the film is my
attempt okay and then really the idea for making the film genuine but genuinely was to get people
together to have these discussions to talk about it and here we are talking kind of to a global audience
about the issues and until we talk about the issues and understand them we won't we won't come up
with a solution and trying to kind of let people know these are some of the people see there's some
amazing people i think we should you should know about and read up about in terms of that specific
one i don't even know where to start on that carol i'm going to hand that one back to you you tell me
the answer i'm going to go to maria actually because i think this question okay because the question
so there's there are roles for certain people to do certain things you know journalist can journalist
write in this and there's there's things that people but what about ordinary people like so in the
philippines when duterte came to power and it became very terrifying you saw people getting
targeted the institutions were crumbling what is the role of citizens here of ordinary people what
can they do what should they be doing standing up right because the battle is now in your court
i think i think in the old world you can say the journalists are gonna do it you know there's this
funny uh that quote of um oh my gosh i can't remember his name but no in the philippines they
came for the journalists we don't know what happened next right um but in on social media
in the virtual world you are specifically targeted so the question is what are you gonna do and i think
we journalists certainly the people in this in this zoom i feel like sisyphus and cassandra combined
i think i've been jumping up and down since 2016 when i saw it it was like that joseph conrad heart
of darkness saw it and asif had his moment carol had and rana had their moments we lived through it
and we're still doing our best i think that's the key part right in each of your area in each of our
areas of influence how can we prevent what this this train wreck from hap from happening we still
have a small window of opportunity but we can't do this alone it is every single person on social
media if you talk facebook 3.2 billion accounts on facebook if each one of those accounts realizes
they're being manipulated they've been cloned and then leaves or or that or organizes in the real
world right this concept of there are different laws for the virtual world i.e none because nothing
except for the eu's digital services and digital markets are which only kicked in all right it's the
least regulated industry globally um and yet here we are there's only one person living in the physical
world and in the virtual world we're being manipulated in the virtual world to change the
way we act in the real world so get your agency back reclaim your rights organize in the real world
that's what we've seen succeed poland that's where the women and the youth came together and kicked out
a sitting government right other countries like that i'm going to go to you briefly rana and then because
i'm conscious of the time so but can we run how you know you've got you've come under such attack
and i know it's been really really tough at times and you've felt very sort of isolated and targeted
are there were there ways that people were able to help you during this and are there ways that you can
see people in india reclaiming that space and reclaiming that agency that maria talks about so i think
people in india did try to reclaim their space when we had this citizenship protest in 2020 just before
the covid um the covid wrecked havoc havoc in india but the government of india used the pandemic to
arrest all those people who who were dissenting and were organizing these protests and it was a big sign
to the rest of the country and some of india's best student activists and some of india's best academics
and some of india's best social activists right now are behind bars for the last four years and they
have no and they have not been given bail despite no case against them the common public a lot of them
i mean and maria was saying i mean you're talking about galvanizing i i feel i feel it's this it's very
unjust on all of us that there's so much burden placed on our shoulder that you need to do this and
you need to do that despite all the cases against you despite everything against you
the common public wants to stay apolitical in india one because they want to steer clear of any
controversy because you know you have a government which is looking for the smallest sign of rebellion
to kind of throw you behind bars or act against you uh i don't think that consolidating consolidation
is happening anytime soon in india because of the draconian measures being used by the indian
government but it is the need of the hour you cannot you have to push back and that's the only solution
we have right now i've got a problem because i've been sitting in parliaments at the moment because
i'm running off to another panel and this is the division bell going which is to call the mps in
but then maybe you know this is going to be the backdrop for my last question which is this you know
the whole point about 2073 is it's almost too late but it's not too late so can i just go around and
do you're like what's your one thing what's your one takeaway that you're going to tell people maria
get off these platforms that's hard to do join the matrix protocol and let us create the world we want
to live in and rana um the the only way to kind of i don't know you have to disinformation and
misinformation is not just the job to to kind of uh you know solve this problem it's not just the job
of a handbook of journalists and activists you need to do that actively yourself within your family
within your you know close friends and circuits on your whatsapp groups i think you have to start
from there fight disinformation and misinformation before it engulfs you in the alternate truth uh world
without facts brilliant and and asif what about i know you hate telling people what to do but what
should they do come on but i concur with everyone's just said but also the key thing for me from every
screening i've done is we're the grown-ups we have to do something about it i really don't like it when
i keep hearing the next generation they're great they'll sort it out it's like no we should sort it
out we have to do something we have to stand up we have to speak up we shouldn't be afraid to speak up
and if we do then we might leave something better behind us for the next generation but don't leave it to
them do something now and it is as simple as removing an app and then starting by talking to
your parents talking to your kids talking to your family start with your own home and your own
friends and then you can widen it out to a community and the key thing about making cinema is i love the
idea there's a bunch of people who don't know each other in a dark room experiencing something together
and when a film ends they talk to each other and what i want to do is create that community with what
we've got to do and not be us alone on an app because that's what they want that's what the
technology bro guys want they want you arguing with someone that may not even exist rather than
dealing with real people oh thank you thank you asif that's that is actually a great way to end it and
so and on that so there's if if you go to the website it's film 2073 2073.film oh i always get it the
wrong way around if you sign up for the newsletter there it's not just a newsletter we're trying to
create a community here because i think you know listening to rana listening to maria is that this
sort of collective action and solidarity and networks of support sharing ideas sharing best practice this
is actually what is going to be required you know the the the sort of top model top down model that we
have been used to is gone we are going to have to rebuild from the ground up and um thank you
everybody for coming thank you for the citizens for organizing for ben whisky during clara mcguire
and manasa naranian for organizing this event and for you three for showing up it's been really great
and we we need more we need to come together more to to start with maria and rana we work on a citizens
project called the real facebook oversight board and it's really thinking about that came out of how do
we hold the tech platforms to account you know we're in a far worse position than we were when we
started that project in 2020 so we need to regroup as well don't we anyway and thank you carol for
all that you're doing in the fight all right so thank you everybody for coming and more soon
hopefully and we fight on thank you everyone
thank you
