Hey guys it's Matt Gray from Cheltenham UK Philosophers here. Just had a fantastic conversation
with Matt Segal the renowned process philosopher. He's well decorated respected academic he's
associate professor of philosophy cosmology and consciousness at the California Institute of
Integral Studies. He's published three fantastic books The Re-Emergence of Schelling Philosophy in
a Time of Emergency in 2014, Physics of the World Soul Whitehead's Adventure in Cosmology in 21
and Crossing the Threshold, Etheric Imagination in the Post-Kantian Process Philosophy of Schelling
and Whitehead. That's 23 which is no longer last year because it's 25 so Happy New Year to everybody.
Thoroughly enjoyed this conversation. We touched on psychedelics, metaphysics, ethics, ecology,
cryptocurrency, bitcoin, obviously A&N Whitehead and the limits of knowledge laid down by Kant so the
sort of Kantian threshold and post-Kantian metaphysics and you know we touched on the work of sort of
Kastrup, Hoffman, Levin and Sheldrake and it was just a really really really fun conversation. I could
I could just listen to this Matt all day and yeah awesome hope you enjoy it.
See you soon. Bye.
Hi Matt.
Hey Matt.
I'm sure you're probably aware that Matthew means gift from Jehovah in ancient Hebrew.
Um yes that's right. I'm sure that is is true for for for yourself. All of my friends know this you
know um so I I thought we could perhaps start I mean I you're obviously a renowned sort of
Whiteheadian thinker you're you're an expert on process philosophy and process theology and so on
and so forth but amongst other things but could you give us a bit of a kind of informal you know
introduction is sort of where you where you've come from how you ended up getting that sort of
philosophical itch that led you led you into the path of Whitehead and so on so so what's your
background hmm yeah well excited to chat with you Matt um yeah Whitehead's definitely become
like my home base at this point but um I am deeply
devoted you know it's not just an interest it's a it's a real devotion to philosophy as a
a life path um and I'm lucky enough that I get to teach and uh do research and that they pay me to
do to do this uh I still have to pinch myself every morning and um you know just I'm I'm so thankful
that uh you know that there's still enough um interest and uh passion around these ideas you know
that I get to do this for a living um I usually refer back to a experience I had as a seven-year-old
um to explain how I got onto the philosophical path um I'll give the short version of the story
basically I I realized my mom was going to die just sort of spontaneously one day she's still alive
perfectly healthy at the time but it was just this realization that eventually she would die and um that
really tore me up for a few weeks I was just crying and worried uh that I wouldn't see her again
if I went to school and um and that it lasted a few weeks and it wasn't until I considered my own death
that this sense of um dread of my mom dying began to shift because when I faced death uh directly as
something that I myself would eventually experience all of a sudden it wasn't so terrifying and became
more mysterious and that contemplation as a seven-year-old in very simple terms without any
vocabulary or understanding of philosophy or the history of spirituality and how people have
culturally found ways of you know dealing with death um I I was hooked you know just in that that that
sense of wonder that contemplating death inspired in me and again I didn't have the words for it as a
seven-year-old um but I was a very curious kid I loved to watch people and was just a quiet kid and
sensitive to these subtle and psychological and social dynamics that I would see going on around me and
just took a really deep interest in the human condition and had a couple of really influential
teachers in high school exposed me to some ideas I didn't really become a reader until maybe junior
but really senior year of high school and started to become a voracious just have a voracious appetite for
for books and started reading Carl Jung and Alan Watts and Friedrich Nietzsche maybe a little too early didn't
understand what I was reading as an 18 year old but it it had an attitude about it that I liked um and yet wasn't
um exposed to Whitehead until after high school um I was listening to some lectures by a psychedelic
philosopher named Terence McKenna uh who mentioned he drops Whitehead's name here and there um Alan Watts
also dropped Whitehead's name in some of the lectures I was listening to from him but uh I was I was warned
not to study Whitehead alone uh but to you know do it formally in grad school and got to study with a
professor named Eric Weiss who has since um passed on beginning in 2009 no 2008 actually I took my first
course with him on Whitehead and um never looked back I was just hooked uh there's something about
Whitehead's philosophy that's so comprehensive and um also applicable to so many different domains of
experience that um I haven't gotten bored with it all these years later um but you know I'm also very
interested in the history of philosophy going back to um at least in the west going back to the
pre-Socratics and I'm a big Platonist um and I like to study philosophy as an evolution of consciousness
not just as a history of ideas but like um shifting world views and like the very way
human beings perceive reality has shifted over the course of millennia and I think philosophy
the history of philosophy reflects that and can help us um find guidance in the present as we
you know face a very uncertain future um and so now a lot of my work is um yeah trying to deal with
what's called the meta crisis um where socially ecologically the human species seems to have reached a
uh a breaking point where the old ways of thinking and and doing and being are no longer adequate to the
circumstances we find ourselves in and we need more than just new philosophical perspectives to deal with
this situation but I think our our basic attitude and um view of what the human being is and our
role in the universe needs to change right and and so there's a bit of a chicken and an egg thing with
like oh is it the world view first that needs to change or is it our institutions does this need to be a
ground-up political revolution or do we need to shift individual consciousness first and I think
you know all of it at once um and I just happen to be more uh perhaps better situated to address the
philosophical side of this crisis so yeah how how well does whitehead lend himself to this crisis in
terms of you know his metaphysics and how how would they apply to a sort of modern problem yeah well in
his book um his 1925 book science of the modern world which is now a hundred years old he was already
recognizing the way in which this obsolete already then mechanistic worldview um led us to imagine that
the natural world around us only had value uh if we as human beings attributed value to it and um
that's not only anthropocentric but even uh the type of value that that human beings attributed to nature
is often purely economic um i mean there were movements already early in in the 20th century to
you know in the us at least to establish like the national parks and there was this sense so we should
protect the wilderness protect the environment but um even there the values were aesthetic and very
anthropocentric but for the most part value in our world 100 years ago and still today if not more so
today is based on um economic uh profitability and whitehead warned that if we continue to ignore
the intrinsic values of the natural world around us the value that um other species have
just in and of themselves without human beings having to place any value upon them whether economic
or aesthetic or any other type of human value of course we emerge from that world don't we you know we
we are all in the world as opposed to distinct entities from it and that's something to do with
that shift is it perhaps exactly exactly and so rather than thinking that the human being is the sole
source of value in the universe we from whitehead's point of view need to come to an understanding of
our own values as derivative from the cosmos derivative from the rest of the community of life on earth
um so that we inherit our sense of value from these wider much more ancient life processes right um and
it's so it's a tremendous de-centering of the human being and a humbling but at the same time an
acknowledgement of our power because we we can and are destroying um the life systems of the planet and
because we're so alienated from those life systems we're only now beginning to wake up to the danger that
we're putting our own species in by undermining the conditions of our own survival so acknowledging the
intrinsic value of the living world was i think something that um very few philosophers were aware
of whitehead wasn't the only one back then um but he was one of the very prescient uh thinkers who was
warning uh about the trajectory we were on and um i think much of what he warned about
has come to pass you know and at some level so much has been lost already it's not that it's entirely
too late but um there's so much that we can't recover that's already been lost yeah i mean this
is fascinating because you know it's quite easy to get lost in the details of metaphysics but
yeah it seems to me that your metaphysics actually have applicability to the real world um because
given you know i mean i could i just um run this past you so is it because of the process nature of
whitehead's thinking that it's sort of less objectified if you like so it's less about
counting objects in in the world and and so that can ramify in terms of economics and cultural sort of
attitudes and so on is this the kind of thing we're talking about yeah well it's you know he has a
different approach to what would um what scientific knowledge would amount to i think the scientific
materialist project was originally rooted in the idea that we could come to have certain knowledge and
as a result of that knowledge kind of absolute control over um natural systems because if if the
universe is primarily uh mechanistic all we need to do is reverse engineer those mechanisms understand
um the mathematical principles that underlie them and then um when we find the right model
that we you know there was this tendency in among the scientific um materialists and
mechanists to equate model and reality um it's not like the ancient you know prior to the scientific
revolution the medieval and ancient thinkers uh you know like archimedes an ancient um engineer had a very
detailed understanding of mechanism it's just that um these ancient thinkers never got the strange idea to
identify the mechanisms and the models that they could mathematically work out with the way that nature
operates because they understood nature to be alive um and even in sold and something shifted with
you know descartes and newton galileo and and the other sort of founders of this new scientific materialist
approach um where all of a sudden yeah nature was equated to a machine and this pursuit of knowledge that
would give us a certain degree of prediction and control over nature became the primary um drive
underlying motivating science and whitehead is shifting our conception of what it would mean to know
nature because as you're saying there's this um process dimension to his understanding of reality there's
also a relational dimension so often his metaphysics is called process relational uh metaphysics or ontology
because what they're finally are for whitehead are not bits of matter moving around an empty space that
might be geometrically modeled with absolute precision um you know there's there's this old idea of nature at an
instant and simple location and from whitehead's point of view with quantum theory and with uh relativity
theory and then even before that there was this rise of statistical methods in science where you know
if you want to understand um you know how gas operates like we're not gonna be able to track every
individual molecule but statistically in large aggregate we can you know get a sense for how
how gases will behave and so there's already an epistemological shift going on and whitehead is kind
of um spelling out the metaphysical consequences of the shifts that already occurred within science
in the early 20th century and so knowledge becomes less about being absolutely precise and certain and more
about um knowing how to enter into relationships with uh these processes that were embedded within
and you know we're navigating um in a whiteheadian universe we're navigating uh relationships with
living systems that are responsive to our ways of looking at them and our ways of uh you know
interacting with them so that it's not just dead and hard stuff out there that's indifferent to how we
observe it i mean this is very obvious to biologists and ethologists who are studying animals
that reminds me of something rupert sheldrake commie i've mentioned he said that he he wasn't cool
with chopping animals up to try and understand animals he thought let's actually just interact
with them and observe them and so on and so forth and um you know that's that's quite interesting isn't
it you know totally rather than using them as an object for human advantage actually right respect what
they are and what they represent and so on um yes could i just while i while i remember i just want to
what what did um whitehead think about space was i mean was space a sort of was it a given in his
system or is it like an emergent property or what what did he say about space well he said there's no
such thing as empty space okay um i mean he fully accepted the relativistic um paradigm shift he had
some critiques of of einstein we can get into those details but in general the idea of space and time or
space time um not as like space doesn't exist independently of the matter which floats in it
for whitehead space is actually a it's more like a field of potentiality it's it's the way in which
um occasions of experience in his terms actual occasions of experience relate to one another
and so rather than thinking of space as already existing and then you have entities that inhabit that
space whitehead space emerges from the relationships among actual occasions and so it's a bit of a figure
ground shift and it's even more i would say it's even more relativistic than einstein's conception
so it doesn't presuppose some medium through which these entities can relate it's it's more about
just the relationship itself so i mean this reminds me of some of them what chris fields has been doing
on um his physics is information processing because he assumes nothing as well he just says look there
are these entities communicating information across boundaries you know and um right just sort of
pairs it back to the absolute essentials and it doesn't assume space or time i don't think
um so so sorry to interrupt please do carry on but i mean also what did he say about time yeah that would
be good well i mean he's a process philosopher and so on the one hand time is very important and
irreducible but there's a difference between clock time that time that we can measure
um and lived time let's say or a kind of uh creative unfolding so you know in physics
most of the equations of physics and relativity theory and quantum theory um the the direction of time is
irrelevant the the the laws of physics work just as well in either direction and so that's only
the only the only approach in physics that where that's where time as a directional process features
would be in thermodynamics because there's this movement towards a direction uh towards entropy
towards disorder and movement towards equilibrium um but for the most part in physics uh time is this
is this um you know parameter that can go in either direction which stands in sharp conflict to our perception
of time our experience of time which is um an irreversible forward moving process forward in
the sense of you know the past has already occurred the future has not yet occurred and we exist always
in this in whitehead's terms of perpetually perishing present which is to say the present doesn't last
and yet there's nowhere else we could ever be but there's something about the nature of
time as creative becoming so not not what we can measure in a quantitative way but this qualitative
unfolding of time that whitehead would call creative advance that um his description of that would be
a process that is um iterative meaning there's a kind of cycling um we're always in the now but the now is
always incorporating uh uh what has perished um and and repeating everything which has occurred before
but not only is time iterative and whitehead sense but it's cumulative so that no two moments are ever
the same because they're going to be incorporating uh the just prior moments right and so for whitehead um
time is this like yeah it's it's a it's a cyclical but a cumulative process and so no two moments
uh are the same every new drop of experience every new actual occasion of experience
is is unique in world history um and there's a there's a a creative unfolding that for whitehead is it's
going somewhere it's not going to um climax in some final moment at the end of time it's an endless
process uh but there is a mckenna talked about the um what was it the the ideal object i'm way of zero
yeah yeah yeah yeah so so so so but not not the case for whitehead though no and and it's interesting
because mckenna in talking about his fractal understanding of time is this time wave model
that he developed and supposed to end on what december 21st 2012 and terence mckenna died before
he he could see that his theory was not confirmed on the other hand things have gotten really weird
since then so maybe something has shifted but he used whitehead in a way that um to support his theory
that i don't think is actually um a fair reading of whitehead uh and that's fine i mean mckenna was a
creative thinker and appropriated from different um philosophies in a way that served his own project
and that's just what we do as when we're creative um but whitehead doesn't see an end to time
um it's it's if i could put it this way time is eternal uh and and really his whole understanding
of what's happening in each present moment he has a word for this called concrescence it's an intersection
where time and eternity meet right and so we're constantly being in each moment refreshed by this
eternal perspective um that whitehead uses the traditional language of god to refer to this
perspective um there's this eternal divine envisagement of ideal possibility and each of our
temporal moments as we as history unfolds is given a little injection of this eternal perspective of ideal
possibility and moment by moment we're trying to integrate that ideal with the real which when
it has actually happened and whitehead will say like history is a wreck um but we continue to soldier
on we continue to have hope in a better future because we're refreshed by this eternal perspective
moment by moment and that refreshment does to the extent that there is a creative um organizational
uh unfolding and when we look at the history of the universe there's an astounding amount of order
um and complexity and there does seem to be an evolutionary movement towards um ever more intense
forms of consciousness and so whitehead would say even though history is a mess and there's plenty of chaos
and disorder and destruction there seems to be more of a tilt towards order than towards chaos
us in the history of our universe right okay so that's how he understands time um more than just
clock time right it's a real creative process with there are qualitative leaps that can occur moment
by moment right and just there's a couple of questions there so number one probably a quick answer
in the same sense that he felt the time wouldn't end um did he think would he say had no beginning
or was there a beginning no beginning so it literally is it's eternal and okay continuous creation
so he's you know whitehead would his metaphysics would extend beyond big bang theory this idea that
space and time have some origin point um however it he has this idea of what he calls cosmic epochs
and that there's this creative plenum i mean for him the ultimate is creativity everything comes out of what
he calls creativity which is very difficult to characterize because there's nothing that isn't
an expression of creativity um but that would exist uh prior to any particular
cosmic order emerging and it could be that there are different cosmic epochs uh elsewhere in the multiverse
if you will you know and so there are ways of making whitehead's metaphysics compatible with a big bang
theory but i think his understanding of um the deep structure of of reality would lend itself more to
an idea of like continuous creation rather than creation being a sort of one-time
event right and i mean there's so many options on the table in contemporary physical cosmology now
different models for understanding the origin of the universe it's kind of um the wild west right now
yeah um and i think whitehead's metaphysics can provide us with some scaffolding to
begin to make sense of uh of the options in a in a logically coherent and empirically adequate way
to the point where um science is making weird or physics mostly is making weirder claims than
than any mysticism really you know especially physics yeah infinite numbers of universes being
generated at infinitesimal points in space you know it's just kind of mind-blowingly crazy but uh
yeah yeah stuff um so also i'm i guess that within i've done a bit of reading i'm struggling on with
this and i you know i know it's a bit of a cliche but he is quite hard to to to sort of read through and
i think it's something about the um jargon and terminology that he uses but um it is it is actually
workable if you just take the time and put the effort and take notes revisit it does slowly but
surely soak in i think some of it has hopefully but um i mean one of the things i'm getting from
it is that he's not teleophobic is he so he's perfectly happy to see that there is a creative
direction of travel for the cosmos right and and for me in some sense that my intuition tells me that
that's kind of obvious you know when you look at sort of evolution as an obvious example that there
seems to be a direction of travel as you hinted at earlier this pursuit of complexity or mckenna might
say novelty you know so um what are your views on this stuff and you know is there is there a sense
in which we can join that journey or can can we resist it or you know how does it bear on sort of
personal uh decisions and so on and so forth you know yeah i mean i think there was clearly a lot
of teleophobia in the origins of modern science um the medieval world very influenced by a certain form
of theology um was uh pursuing forms of teleological explanation that were
kind of well overly anthropocentric such that the purpose of all these different processes
in nature was always to serve the human being because you know god put us at the center of
creation and um and it was a very naive form of teleology and the sorts of uh purpose um
that medieval theologians and scholastics were beginning to imagine as operative in nature
were of the sort that you might expect from a picture of the divine as a kind of engineer
or mechanic um and imposing purpose or design on the universe from outside the universe
um and on some level even though modern science went to great lengths to deny um teleology and focus
only on mechanical causes there's another sense in which um for thinkers like descartes and newton
unless they had this kind of theology in the background where god was imagined as a great engineer
and a mathematician they never would have expected to find mathematical laws in nature
and so there is a real uh sense in which there are theological underpinnings or um presuppositions that led
at least these early scientists to search for the intelligibility of nature in mathematical terms
um but that uh is a i think a deep conflict in in in the scientific um worldview that it comes out of this form of theology
and yet very quickly um you know as we enter into the 19th century really all of a sudden god becomes a hypothesis that
scientists no longer want to make reference to and everything is explained purely in terms of purposeless
um the the playing out of mechanical processes that have no underlying purpose
and whitehead's trying to bring teleology back into the picture here but not of the kind
um that we would describe as design coming from um a god who is separate from the world for whitehead
teleology is is imminent uh it's um it stems from the desires that individual creatures have to to
um intensify their experience and to forge new relationships to support the intensification of that
experience and so rather than thinking of say in the biological realm uh in the way that darwin only
allowed there's a little bit of teleology in darwinian biology which is that organisms want to survive
right that's the one little bit of purpose that a mechanistic biologist will allow for that there's
a survival instinct where does that come from oh i don't know we'll just assume that and then we can get
evolution and natural selection going whitehead says if you actually observe life
in an unbiased way whether your own instincts or any other animal or organism there's more than just
a survival instinct organisms want to thrive there's there's like experience is enjoyable and you know
whitehead says look if natural selection and this desire to survive is the only thing that counts
in biological evolution why is it that we see uh organisms that are more complex and more sensitive
but comparatively deficient in survival power evolving like the human being is very uh fragile
in comparison to uh bacteria which are nearly indestructible and have been around for billions of years
and functionally immortal i mean they don't they don't sexually reproduce they just make copies of
themselves um it's a much more efficient form of life and so if natural selection and the ability to
survive in various environments is what really matters the peak of life was bacteria and so why all
all of this extra complexity why all of this why all of this extra sensitivity i mean yeah we can enjoy
our experience more but we also feel a lot more pain and suffering and so whitehead thinks there must be
another principle at play here which is that life has this intrinsic desire to enhance its experience
right to intensify experience and so that adds another factor it's not that darwin's process
of natural selection is not occurring it is and we know that that applies to the individual organism
their their lifetime they pursue more food and more happiness and more contentment or whatever so so why
not sort of um scale that up you know yeah exactly um and it's not this isn't the kind of teleology that
determines in advance what types of forms will be realized in the living world or in the universe right it's
all it's very open-ended but there is an internal drive to explore that uh i think is not factored in
to the darwinian understanding of of evolution right and so whitehead says yes to darwin and there's more
going on but do you think that that actually looking at some of the cutting-edge science these days we're
beginning to see a more um we're beginning to see more sort of telos you know if you consider the work of
mike levin for example i mean they're looking at the you know extremely basic systems like things
like sorting algorithms that seem to delay gratification and you know so it seems to be
present everywhere and that this leads me to sort of a metaphysical question i mean are you a panpsychist
and you know i've heard that there's a sort of distinction there's a sort of object pants or
substance panpsychist like the likes of philip goff and so on and but you're more of a sort of
process panpsychist is that right is that fair yeah yeah and i'm happy with the panpsychist label
it it can sometimes be misleading because there are different forms different species of panpsychism
that are quite different from one another and their implications but the idea that some degree of
experience um or mentality uh or subjectivity you know whichever word you want to use goes all the way
down i think i would affirm that whitehead affirms that um and so panpsychism is a fair label and i
usually think of four basic positions in metaphysics that are um historically and contemporarily sort of
available to us there's uh materialism dualism panpsychism and idealism um and when i look at
contemporary biology mike levin's a great example of this but there are others dennis noble um you
know i could i could come up with a long list of biologists who think um and philosophers of biology
who think that purpose is a real part of the living world if if not the cosmos as a whole and so there's a
major paradigm shift happening um in biology but the old guard is still you know alive and well and um
um richard dawkins is very yeah he's very articulate and still has a 1960s understanding of what is
state of the art in biology and you know for him coming of age doing his phd research and writing
his famous books like the selfish gene in the 60s late 60s early 70s molecular biology and this genetic
reductionism was all the rage but it turns out that that's a dead end um there's more than than genes going
on but you know i've heard dawkins quite recently give his spin on the whole situation and he thinks
none of the research in the last 50 years changes anything even though i didn't think he doesn't
think noble changed anything but lamarckism is sort of back in the back in the room now isn't it really
too i think so yeah i think so but dawkins will reinterpret everything that's been found to make it
compatible with a gene-centric perspective which he thinks ultimately is what's going on and so you
know science can become just as much a kind of certain scientific perspectives can function just as
much like religions uh yeah you know as as traditional religions can and so i think for dawkins um his
scientific perspective is a world view and it functions not just as a means of you know producing knowledge
but uh as a source of meaning as a source of morality and um yeah it's a comprehensive picture
it's a responsibility right yeah and he's a brilliant communicator of science but i think
um he's he's his science is out of date i would say um is there some sort of an awakening going on
across science and uh you know there's a lot more sort of um integrated work isn't there you know
converge convergences and so on and that seems to be where the fruit is born and um any thoughts you
know are we kind of emerging from the materialist paradigm is that happening now i see a lot of
signs of that and i think that is happening within the scientific community it's happening within academia
a little bit more slowly in those professional settings but when i look at the culture at large
um many many intelligent people um are increasingly skeptical of materialism and more open to panpsychism
and idealism um and i think that's a very positive sign there are risks that come along with that um
but there are risks that come along with adopting materialist worldview as well as
uh rupert sheldrake's always saying it's probably really bad for our mental health
yeah to have this materialist outlook if you think you're a mindless automaton that can't be good for
morale you know yeah yeah and see there are some how does that how does that view help anybody
yeah um you know there are still scientists like you know robert sapolsky probably the most famous
among them who will argue for this really hardcore deterministic point of view and that free free
will any sort of will or effort is just an illusion and um where the victims of um cause and effect
understood in a mechanistic way and the victims are genes and i think that's a totally um
um dysfunctional point of view from my perspective not only because of its negative moral consequences
and there there is a lot of psychological research that suggests when you tell people
that they're deterministic that that determinism is is a fact right before they take a test and have
an opportunity to cheat on that test if you tell them that they're free or tell them that they're
determined beforehand um those who were told they're determined are more likely to cheat
is that right yeah that's fascinating of course of course because that absolves them of any guilt
doesn't it yeah and then and in mental health contexts you know they've done studies about the
language that psychiatrists use when they talk about different mental disorders and if they use more
mechanistic language and make the patient feel like oh this is your it's determined by your genes
it's determined by your brain chemistry they tend to be more uh to have worse mental health outcomes
than if there's emphasis placed on your own willpower your own outlook and changing your own perspective
you know so how we talk about these things does feed back on on our experience and um but regardless
of that sort of the pragmatic consequences of how we think about these things i think it's just
scientifically short-sighted to say that everything is deterministic and mechanistic there are good
yeah it's just not working anymore we've actually so so you could say that actually it's some sort of
um awakening but actually it might just be a pragmatic thing that science is saying well actually
these old models don't work and uh you know banging our heads against a brick wall here and so um
yeah we would they had to change but um sorry do do go on that's fascinating yeah well just to say
like the the way that materialism and mechanism had classically been understood uh by 19th century
science say that whole perspective was destroyed by science itself with the quantum and relativistic
revolutions in the early 20th century so physics itself has destroyed mechanistic materialism
right and i think a lot of um scientists are still catching up to that and there's been a prohibition
against metaphysics in academia for a while it's it's changing now in dramatic ways but for the better
part of the 20th century um philosophers were not really um given the opportunity to engage with
uh quantum physics in a way that would allow us to do the um metaphysical deep dive that you know would
provide an alternative ontology to the old mechanistic ontology whitehead was one of the few that tried to
do that but he was doing it just at a time in the 1920s when philosophy was becoming more analytic
uh more focused on language linguistic analysis um and positive yeah exactly and so these grand
metaphysical projects and doing philosophical cosmology just fell out of favor but again that's
shifting i really do feel like there is a shift within academia within the profession of science as
well as in the broader culture i am i timed going to university i studied philosophy as a mature student
as 27 and um i wanted to do my dissertation on barclay and barclay and idealism and just they just
said don't be daft why would you want to do that that's all all that stuff is solved you know it's
it's rubbish okay and um you know they tried to get me to do one on wittgenstein is a is early work
of course um i ended up doing doing some ethics of euthanasia which is slightly slightly dark but
difficult topic but um yeah they didn't they didn't really encourage anything other than sort of
materialistic or well i mean essentially logical positive positivism just wipes any metaphysical
speculation off the table doesn't it and so right if it can't be weighed and measured or it doesn't
have logical cogency it's it's not worth talking about um so so you're a white hedion but that's not
all you are matt is it i mean um because i've heard you speak in um some detail about cant and so i'd like to
get into the sort of canteen threshold the limits of knowledge and how how can we have metaphysical
knowledge um because i mean while science is perhaps getting a little bit more amenable to non
sort of materialist thinking it's it still raises questions about the very notion of identity and and
um you know what what can we really know when when we're arguably trapped inside this sort of
perceptual bubble you know we're in a theater of perception that's derived from something but we
but how do we know what's out there and how can we talk about that is that a fair question yeah no
absolutely um you know kant's critical philosophy really does challenge this old style um of metaphysical
speculation where um from kant's point of view these dogmatic metaphysicians as he called them were making
claims about realities that were beyond our experience um you know from kant's point of view
we don't actually have any experience of the soul as a substantial reality uh in other words
we we have a psychological experience you know we have a sense of being uh subjects and so on but
we're never given experiential uh exposure to the idea of the soul as an immortal substance like that's a theological idea that
dogmatic metaphysics um just assumed right and built expansive world views around and kant says you know
we really need to do philosophy in a more scientific way let's be grounded in our experience
kant wanted to justify you know necessary and universal knowledge that in other words scientific knowledge but
he did so in a way that limited that scientific knowledge to the realm of phenomena right to our
experience and what nature is in itself or what reality is in itself kant would just say we we don't know
that and we can't know that um and for kant it was good that we couldn't know that because he wanted to
be able to be able to say uh that human freedom will always be irreducible to any scientific mechanistic
account of the phenomenal world of the way that nature appears to us there will always be something
in excess of nature for kant right which is our own human freedom so kant wanted to justify scientific
knowledge rigorously logically without relying on any metaphysics that would make reference to objects
beyond our experience but he also wanted to do justice to um our belief in freedom
and morality without freedom for Kant there's no morality um and by limiting scientific knowledge
which for Kant scientific knowledge meant mechanistic understanding limiting that to phenomena Kant could
then say well behind the scenes somehow our own freedom as human beings and the mechanism of nature
as it appears to us are compatible he can't say exactly why but because science is limited at least it's
possible that there's some underlying magic going on i mean he wouldn't call it magic he would call
it some super sensible substratum that makes freedom and and and the mechanism of nature compatible and
i think it's just an accident of the time that he was born in some sense that he
developed some of these ideas it was in response to the scientific knowledge of the day so if he was
launched into the into modern times would he would he have a different view do you think oh i mean
undoubtedly i'm hard to say what Kant would make of modern science but um and the contemporary
situation but yeah he was very adept at um newtonian physics he understood the math he was an astronomer
before he you know got into developing this transcendental approach to philosophy but it was also the criticisms of
um rationalism and the criticisms of the idea that um we could have scientific knowledge of something
like causality that that came from empiricists like david hume that as kant said awoke him from his
dogmatic slumber and so he needed to come up with new justifications for um causality because from hume's
point of view right famously we we don't um perceive necessary connection between events we assume them
we assume these connections as a result as a result of habit and custom um and so you know kant had to
do all of these gymnastics the quite brilliant gymnastics to show how okay maybe causality isn't
something we perceive but it's a it's a it's a category in terms of which we have to interpret our
experience so he you know he's able to respond to hume and avoid the more radical implications of
hume's skepticism um but he has to sacrifice a lot to do that which is like i was describing earlier
science is no longer telling us what nature is in itself it's only telling us how nature appears to our
kind of mind and so you know i i really do take cons criticism of traditional metaphysics dogmatic
metaphysics seriously and so how do we do metaphysics after kant well i would say it has to be
experientially grounded um we can't be making reference to um that which is by definition
beyond our experience and so our categories and our concepts must be adequate not only adequate to
what we experience but i would say the whole purpose of philosophy takes on for me a pragmatic
orientation which is to say we only know and this is coming out of william james and charles
saunders purse who are all important influences on whitehead we only know what a concept means
ultimately um because of our awareness of its consequences for our experience how does thinking in
this way change my experience how does it change what i can perceive how does it change what i can
do what i imagine i can do and so what i can then do um and so i think there's a there's more to
experience than kant thought for kant you know the forms of intuition of space and time were fixed in
this euclidean way um he acknowledged the role of imagination as quite powerful interestingly in the
second edition of the critique of pure reason he kind of tones down the role that imagination plays
a little bit because i think he was a little uncomfortable uh with the implications there but
one of the implications i think is when we recognize the imaginative ground of our experience
the structure of our experience is actually far more malleable and through creative philosophical efforts
coming up with new concepts as whitehead does which is what makes him difficult to read initially
because he's really reinventing um not only a new language but a new categorical scheme as he calls it
a new set of concepts through which to interpret not only interpret but transform our experience
right and so when we approach experience not as something fixed and already preformed
but as something more malleable and open to experimental uh transformation then all of a sudden we can engage
metaphysics in a more experimental way um grounded in experience rather than always claiming
as it had before kant um to know things beyond experience all we have is experience
right um but philosophy can allow us to uh to transform that experience right our minds we can change
literally we can change our minds and we can then change the nature of incoming experience according to
some of that uh sort of altered frame of reference also um can you can you think of any sort of
examples of that i mean i suppose perhaps you could talk about maybe the sort of practice of meditation or
the way you respond to the world you know uh yeah can you give me some sort of examples of that some
concrete i mean one of the powerful examples that comes to mind immediately is william james
in his battle with depression he was really exploring these ideas of determinism and free will and you
know in his book will to believe he describes his own realization upon recovering from depression
that um this idea of freedom is uh
how to describe this it it has whether or not we think freedom or determinism is real has real
consequences for our mental health right and so when he would he would be asked if we were to ask william
james um are we free or are we determined he would say well if you believe that you're free
then you're free or you have at least some willpower to change your circumstances if you believe that
there there's no freedom then you're determined right and he he realized that his own depression
was only alleviated by his shift in in belief that i'm going to take this idea of freedom seriously and
thereby become free right literally invented a new world in which he was free yeah in some sense an
experience is that malleable i suppose another example might be your metaphysics would have
some impact on how you respond to death for example so oh right if you're utterly convinced that
say something like idealism is is the case then um you know you you're going to say consciousness is
fundamental and you know these these bodies are sort of representations of of some mental mentation right
and and so the death of the physical body is not you know that can't kill consciousness right
um this is a completely different sort of category um yeah and so yeah i mean you know again it's um i
sometimes i have to fight a bit of a battle with friends of mine about the relevance of philosophy
in in the modern world and it's because of things like this that i that i think it is absolutely relevant
you know and you know just setting aside the ethics and everything else um so
so i was going to ask so what are your views on death and you know because we touched on this
earlier and it must it tells us something about the nature of reality doesn't it um that it doesn't
necessarily care so much for the the woes of the individual and it or maybe it does and you know you
know maybe there's there's some necessity to having anxiety to perpetuate the species and so on and so
forth as part of this grand uh foliation but it does seem a bit mean doesn't it and you know to
to give these entities all this uncertainty about it as well um and why why would that you know any
any thoughts on this anyway
yeah i mean no there's so much to say about death and the way that
human culture is so profoundly shaped by our response to death and
death and different cultures have different responses to it and i think so much of what drives
contemporary consumerist culture is a kind of denial of death um we want we and expect that
uh or many people expect that technology and medical advances will eventually allow us to defeat death
there's a whole transhumanist movement that refers to people who find death to be something
essential to life that we have to accept they call us i count myself among those people they call us
deathists because for them for these transhumanists death is just a disease that we should cure
um i don't know it's a medical problem i think it's yeah it's a medical problem it's it's a limitation
that increasing knowledge can eliminate um but i don't think they've really thought through
what a human being who lives forever what a life that's indefinite where we're functionally immortal
what that would really be like and how much actually of the deepest meaning that we find in our lives
comes from its finitude and is it is it is it really possible to to to love someone if there's no
risk of losing them or if that time that we have together on this earth is is indefinitely prolongable
i mean i think it really does start to change the deep access that existential structure of human
existence when we consider eliminating death somehow um i think there are a lot of other ways that that
sort of transhumanist project can go wrong but i i also think um if we were to want to develop say a more
um ecological approach to to ethics um environmental ethics is a big field in in philosophy um because we
need to reimagine our relationship to the natural world one of the ways i've been sort of exploring um
another possibility for developing an ecological ethics would be to consider reincarnation um and to
do so in in a you know more or less naturalistic way just to relate to the whole history of life on earth
all of the species which have existed and the lineages that we as human beings are um born out of
uh we are the reincarnation of this continuous stream of um successful organisms i mean 99 of all the
species who ever have existed have gone extinct but um for those organisms that are alive today we inherit
uh the achievements of billions of years of evolutionary struggle and and joy i think um and so
in a real evolutionary sense um reincarnation is real right yeah um and so i feel kind of eating
itself as well it's like a big restaurant isn't it we consume you know that seems to be almost
foundationally with you know eating seems to be you know we imbibe some of the external world into
ourselves and then put some of our own self out into the external world and that i mean these are the
sorts of things that you can say they're undeniable in some sense the idea of the continuation of
generations and um continuous journey towards it yeah and but to feel to feel okay with
that yeah yeah yeah seeing that you're it's not all about you or or about one it's about the the grand
population if you can call it that yeah no i like that term um but we need a shift in human identity
that allows us to to not just um consider as an idea that we are related to the rest of life on this
planet i mean most educated people accept this idea of a common ancestor of all of life
um but if we can go beyond just the idea of it to really feel that and to identify with life as a
whole um i think and also to consider you know this reincarnational perspective not just as a way of
relating to the past to the history of life but think about the future in some way the damage we do today
it's not just going to affect other people or other beings like who we really are our true identity like
is continuous with this stream of life we will be here in the future to suffer the consequences
of what we're doing today right and so this broadened sense of identity that i think comes in
comes along with considering uh a more or less naturalistic understanding of reincarnation could be
really fruitful uh for helping us to avert you know catastrophe um ecologically speaking and so
it in terms of relating to death it's like it doesn't make death any more um difficult on some level
like we give up a lot when we die but i don't think we give up everything like this body everything we've
tended to identify with while alive in this body will will perish i'm pretty sure of that but i think
that there's this underlying continuity that will continue and i don't have any scientific proof of
that obviously these i'm building analogies um and you know looking at say the way in which
it's very odd that we don't fully consider this but like we're awake for two-thirds of the day and then
for a third of the 24-hour cycle we're asleep our bodies are just vegetating they're in bed and
um then we wake up in the morning and continue on with just and there's this this gap every day in
our lives in our stream of consciousness and we just sort of accept that as normal but if you really
consider it why wouldn't we want to imagine some analogy here just as the life-death cycle occurs
every 24 hours or the sorry the sleep-awake cycle occurs every 24 hours maybe there's a similar
life-death cycle which occurs you know across uh lifetimes right and it's just that we wake up as
someone new and instead of as the same person with that sense of continuity but from whitehead's point
of view we're new every moment you know there's a death rebirth process happening moment by moment by
moment and you can almost feel that sometimes sometimes i almost get a sort of insight thing
actually you know i've changed i'm changed a certain piece of music or a film or an experience
or a conversation you come away a changed person you can actually sense it and i wanted to ask you
something another metaphysical question um is everything alive is there anything that is not
involved in the sort of the the dance of of life because i mean just just a daft um sort of example
you could imagine a planet with no kind of organic material on it right um but it's still milling
about in some sense to you know it may have a um predisposition towards complexity or something like
that that will eventually produce these i mean i suppose what i'm saying is that there is no problem
of abiogenesis because it seems to me that there's a continuity as you mentioned all the way down
um so it feels that the whole cosmos is involved in this um unfolding right so in that sense given
that we're continuous with the rest of it then the whole thing's alive in in my in my humble opinion
i'm just wondering what your view is on that i agree i i think life is a matter of degrees
and there's there's no zero point um you know but a lot depends on how we define life and the thing is
we have one example of life on this planet we have some evidence there may have been life on mars and
maybe on other planets in our solar system um but as many astrobiologists will point out because we
only have one example of life we don't really know if the sort of carbon-based substrate that we're used to
is the only way that um the type of chemical complexity we associate with biological organisms can
can do the thing like it could be that there are many other chemical pathways to life and we don't
really know what we mean by life here again defined in terms of biological organisms until we have another
example of it um there could be a very different form of life say in the clouds of venus that are it
could be life here that we just can't perceive that's true well yeah you know donald hoffman points out
quite um you know well that um you know we don't well he thinks he's shown mathematically that we
we don't receive any true information about the external world um right so you know and we literally
just um refine our behaviors and so on based on what's beneficial to us in terms of eating and
reproducing and so on so you know there could be a whole host of things going on right now that we're
and i mean one of the other things that comes to mind is this idea of the collective intelligence
and again something that levin talks about extensively is that we're not as really a
single being in a sense that we're a what do you what do you call a community of um what's the term
that you use society of society society that's that's right yeah and in some sense that you know
the human body is is uh made up of these different sort of entities the kidney probably doesn't know
that it's part of some larger system in the same way that an ant might not know it's part of you
know what its colonies objectives are but yet there is this overarching t loss of these these
organizations and so um i've forgotten where i'm going with this actually but uh all intelligence is
collective intelligence i would say right yeah yeah um which is something that michael levin is
constantly harping on and um you know there's there's this approach in cognitive science that's called
extended cognition where you know instead of thinking of um just individual brains as the
locus of cognitive activity uh we could study intelligence it's better to study intelligence
and cognition in a more socially extended way so that like um you know you could use a military example
like a a battleship uh which is composed of however many hundreds of of sailors is is itself
um a cognitive system of some kind that can only perform the tasks of information processing and
interpretation that it does as a result of the relationships among all of those human beings and
the tools and technologies and instruments that they're using and so like the intelligence doesn't
belong to any individual right yeah there's something that sports teams in a way in a similar fashion
couldn't you i think that's what i was just just trying to get to this idea that there could be a
sort of meta intelligence of which we are a part because if we're composed of these individual
components why suppose that we're that it stops here do you see what i mean what do you think and is
that testable i mean i wonder whether that's actually potentially testable if you could observe
collective action that could not be attributed to the the kind of the amalgam of all of their individual
goals and it's it's can be shown that there's some other force involved maybe i don't know
there's a total speculation there but with any thought well i think levin is showing how cellular
collectives can achieve feats of um cognitive prowess that no individual cell could do on its own and that
there is definitely something that emerges um at the level of whole tissues and organ systems and the
organism as a whole um that none of the individual cells seem to know about as separate entities but
that is achieved at this meta level and why wouldn't we continue that analogy up the scale um and consider
the earth or gaia as this kind of uh collective mind that we as individuals usually at least are not
consciously aware of participating in but um the earth as a whole this guy in consciousness
could be conscious of of us all not just humans perhaps but all living beings
in a way that we can only dimly imagine or perhaps in some special states altered states of
of consciousness we can participate in that to some degree and you know merge with the guy in mind for
a time um but i think there's every reason to to take these analogies seriously or why wouldn't nature
work similarly at different scales um i think the burden of proof would be on those who would deny that
um because it's it's like it's very easy for the materialist to say oh well we know consciousness is
produced by the neurons in the brain do we i've never heard of a mechanism that could explain how neural
activity and neurochemistry again imagined in a mechanistic way could give rise to this totally
other domain called consciousness like i i've never even seen a hypothesis that could account for that
type of transition right so why do we assume that brains produce consciousness and that there couldn't
be some higher level consciousness where each of us is like the neuron in this larger brain you know
so i think i think we should take these analogies seriously yeah in terms of this larger brain
um we could we could put the word god in there couldn't we i mean what are your views on god is
there some sort of cosmic intelligence of which we're a part and perhaps it fills us you know in the way
that we perhaps feel an itch on our foot or something like that you know or or it could be phenomenally
conscious of everything that we're doing any thoughts on this stuff and and how some of why headian
thinking what you're thinking perhaps plays into mysticism and and spirituality yeah i think it's
natural to move in that direction when you begin to consider a panpsychist metaphysics um you know
william james wrote a book called a pluralistic universe where he's drawing on a german scientist and
and philosopher named gustav feckner and feckner was a panpsychist who uh had a a sense that we are
as human beings um enveloped within uh ever widening circles of consciousness larger than ourselves and
so there's the earth consciousness and then maybe there's the a consciousness associated with the sun and
the solar system as a whole the whole galaxy i mean when i think about that reminds me of olaf's have
you heard of olaf stapled them oh sure yeah yeah star maker is that yeah yeah star maker and the the
third and last man i think it was a person last minute a massive fan but um that seemed to be the
sort of thing he was talking about that sort of up eventually gets to the godhead and understands what's
going on you know he's trying out thinking i think he read whitehead too actually right that doesn't
surprise me actually um but uh yeah he's what a profound thinker what a beautiful what a beautiful
book as well uh yeah sorry do do continue just reminded me there yeah for good reason um and so
it's a view of the divine that i think would be again less about um a god that would be placed outside
the universe um and this is less monotheistic in a way because there's more um of a sort of it's
like concentric circles right and so there are um there's this term holearchy i'm not sure if you're
familiar with it that comes out of arthur kersler's work they have a hole on is like a whole part you
can't it's not just a particle it's not just a hole because the thing about the way our universe is
organized is it's like um our bodies are whole but they're made of cells which themselves have a kind
of wholeness and so it's like nested holes all the way up and all the way down and you can instead of
describing the universe as a hierarchy you could describe it as a wholearchy but it seems like
we're nested within these layers of consciousness that go all the way up and all the way down and
there's an increasing intensity and um depth of consciousness you know as you as you go up but it
seems like the human might be perched at a particularly um um important middle place within
this whole you know expanse because like it's very easy and probably seems to me correct to say that
like a cell in our kidney doesn't know it's part of a human body it's just doing its kidney thing
but human beings were at least capable of becoming aware of the fact that wow i'm made of cells that each
seem to have their own experience and then myself a cell and this larger guy an organism and the solar
system it's like so we seem aware of the these layers to some degree in a way that i don't know
that other organisms are you know and so there's a new kind of important role for the human being even
after we get over the anthropocentrism that led to the ecological crisis um and the appropriation of all
value and purpose for just the human being we need to get over that but there might be a new kind of
important role for the human being when we inhabit a living universe where you know as the buddhists
would say being human is a very auspicious occasion because we have this cosmic perspective
that might not be available to to other creatures so you're talking about us being at sort of like a
midpoint somewhere between you know we've got sort of partly divine perhaps and sort of part part beast
and part angel you could you could say right is that kind of thing yeah and it's a very ancient
perspective you know the the human being as a microcosm um but also the human being being very much
in the middle of things um you know from like dante's perspective like the earth uh is right between
heaven and hell um but it's it's quite striking the way that modern cosmology and our capacity to
measure the very small and very large we also seem to be right at the center of things and you might say
well how could we not feel like we're at the center because we can only see so far in either direction
but it seems like there are real limits here it's not just the limits of our ability
to see but that you know the the capacity for energy as we know it to organize itself
hits a bottom floor uh and similarly when we look out at the cosmic um uh the edge of the cosmos and
the microwave background radiation it seems like the the scale the powers uh the logarithmic um scales
here have us at the center and so science contemporary cosmology has kind of rediscovered this this ancient
understanding of the human being um being a a fulcrum point uh kind of meeting place between yeah the
angelic and the animal um which gives us a unique vantage point that you know makes us interesting um
even to say the angels or say even to the higher consciousnesses that there's something unique about
the human being that they're very interested in um and you see this coming through and in like um
i don't know if you're a lord of the rings fan massive massive lord of the rings fan so the elves
are very interested in human beings because we die yeah right yeah they're kind of envious of this
yeah because and i think again it speaks to the importance of of death that we we shouldn't rush to
eliminate death when it might be the most important thing about us um and instead of just imagining it
as an end and a horrible thing that we would want to avoid at all costs it could be that um death is
the very source of of the most profound meaning that that we have access to you know yeah it's funny i did
have i did have some possible pushback on that then i was just wondering there may be some advantages
with people being say longer live not necessarily immortal but longer live to give you more time
to sort of figure out what's going on and and how to conduct yourself you know but but well but in
but if reincarnation is a thing then we we will have another chance indeed indeed because nothing's
wasted i mean that's what i like about that vision that reincarnation model you you offered up is
that things wasted yeah everything is significant you know and that that's that you know so so just so
suffering um you know feelings of inadequacy all this depression all that has a has a
has a a function in this in this view i think um but what i wanted to ask you i wanted to just um
because i'm conscious of time um i wanted to just get your views on psychedelics i mean there's a
couple of um burning questions i mean first of all i think they have profound implications for
consciousness because you know some of the studies that bernardo castrop has popularized he's shown
that there's certain sort of states in dmt where brain activity goes down almost to zero so you've got a
you know a brain not doing anything and people are having the most profound experience
they could they could possibly have um is it a glimpse into the to the transit you know is it a
glimpse into a higher consciousness of some sort there's people that have repeated um sort of
experiences on dmt that are consistent across different individuals they're doing these kind of um
you know they're putting people on drips now and having these longer term
i think it's happening in britain somewhere i can't remember the university um what are your
thoughts on this stuff and and then why does nature produce these chemicals or these compounds that
that give us these insights i mean mckenna obviously talked about having conversations
with a great other you know you sort of go into that space and ask them metaphysical questions and so
on and so any thoughts on this one before i babble on all night about well i mean on the the last
point why should these um chemicals so-called they're called secondary metabolites and in the
sense that um mushrooms say psilocybin mushrooms the psilocybin genus produces these chemicals as a
secondary metabolite in the sense that they're not a primary part of the metabolic process that the
mushroom and the mice don't have to do it they don't have to do it no it's for us that's fascinating
and so it's a means of communicating um that an ecosystem has to communicate between organisms
these secondary metabolites and they're all psychoactive in various ways the the traditional
psychedelic compounds are especially potent um to mammals it seems but there are other animals that
know to find these mushrooms and they have their experience uh or or you know other psychedelic uh plants
and so human beings aren't the only ones that like to alter their consciousness um but like why these
secondary metabolites exist it seems to have a lot to do with or everything to do with this
evolutionary history and the ways that tens of millions of years ago um insects were interacting with
plants and our own nervous systems and neurochemistry is intimately related to the neurochemistry of insects
um and these molecules evolved over the course of millions of years of interaction between insects
and plants and then eventually more complex animals and plants um as a way of i think of the ecosystem as
a whole you could say gaia's mind of regulating itself um and that's amazing the fact you can show that these
species could could manage without this additional functionality but yet they they do it anyway because it's
perhaps part of some broader requirement for communication within the the ground within the
gaia you know that's that's amazing yeah and there's there's dimethyltryptamine everywhere it's in grass
it's not in tremendously high concentrations but you could theoretically as far as i'm not a chemist but
i've heard you can if you get enough grass and know the chemical process to distill it there's enough dmt
in there in grass clippings that you could you know so um you know the psychedelic renaissance that's
going on is i think exciting i remember being in college and learning about the 1960s and the first
sort of psychedelic revolution in uh in in the west um and really thinking like gosh um it's too bad that
didn't succeed and you know maybe all we need to do is spike the water with lsd and then all the
politicians would suddenly realize the their mistakes and but yeah i'm i'm less um i'm less naive
about the potential here it's not automatic the thing about these psychedelics um they can have bad
trip they can have bad trips it would make them worse yeah exactly you you know they can be used to treat
ptsd and they can cause new trauma if not done in a in a safe and enriching um environment and context
and so um they're not a silver bullet they're i like uh one of my teachers um stanislav groff described
psychedelics as non-specific amplifiers okay non-specific amplifiers of our existing you know the terms that
tim leary and richard alpert used were set and setting so our mindset and our cultural environment
and then the very physical environment that we're in while we're tripping has a huge influence on what
we experience um yeah i mean mckenna used to go into a dark room didn't they didn't even do five
dried crowns yeah and he's like don't even do it with other people that brings culture in the room and
if you really want to go you know deeper than our cultural conditioning you need to be alone when you
do these things which you know raises questions about the research settings where it's very much
a mental health framework um where these are being explored right now um which is fine i think there's
lots of application there but the experience you have in a clinical setting you you know a hospital
room or you know a square room and they try to make it look nice but you've got two therapists
hovering over you you're in bed you've got your earphones on and they're they've chosen the
soundtrack of usually classical music or whatever it's very um personally i would feel quite anxious
in that environment yeah um and much more comfortable either by myself or with some friends
like at the beach or in the woods um but from a clinical point of view that's not safe
um but when and you know there's a i'd say the clinical setting is not safe that's not right at
all right um yeah i mean that's that's that's a whole interesting conversation i mean not to
i think most therapists are are honest professional people who uphold ethical boundaries but you know even
without psychedelics involved many therapists end up having inappropriate relationships with their clients and
when you throw psychedelics into the mix the transference is much more intense and so there are
risks of you know being in that clinical environment yeah that are negligible um but just the anxiety
produced by being watched by these professional psychologists you know who with their clip pads
taking notes like i just when you're in a psychedelic state that's like i get alien abduction vibes you
know it's the last thing you want you want isn't it yeah um but matt matt do you think these these entities
that people encounter on dm i mean i've not done dmt myself um but are they encountering agency other agents
i think um
um i do think that we have to i i have had experiences of what i can only refer to as non-physical entities or
agencies um and it's very convincing and i i have enough you know ability to take a skeptical stance even on my
own experience to say of course there are many possible explanations for this like the brain might
be hardwired to you know attribute agency um yeah seeing faces for example and and yeah yeah yeah um
but on the other hand some of the most powerful and transformative experiences of my life have been
a result of encountering the beings in a psychedelic state that um have a message you know and have something
to convey and i think um this is not um this is not unusual in the history of uh our species um
you know now we this if you're embedded in the psychedelic counterculture you might call them
self-transforming machine elves like mckenna uh a lot of people are having what they describe as
extraterrestrial encounters with aliens or but if you go back a few hundred years people talked about
angels and demons and um so that reminds me of the ufo phenomena as well because they they seem to have
the the the things that people report seeing have moved with technology haven't they so there's a
similar kind of pattern there as well exactly um and i think uh you know the you asked about space
earlier and um i think psychedelics open up this possibility that we can begin to explore inner space
you know in a way that would allow us to appreciate how vast that domain is might even it might even be
vaster than what we think of as the external um cosmos and it could be that um all of intelligent life
and the cosmos is interconnected somewhat like interdimensionally or so you could say through
this inner space of consciousness and the best hope we have for contacting alien intelligence is not to
imagine we might travel through physical space to other solar systems i mean it just takes so damn long and
um that might be impractical even with more advanced technology but maybe again it might be it might be a
technology of some sort maybe that gaia has generated to to enable this broader right communication
yeah very speculative but i think um there's we haven't really we've just only just begun as with a
modern scientific attitude exploring these inner domains and i think we have a lot to learn from
indigenous traditions that have been doing this for thousands of years um but i yeah i do think these entities are
real in some sense um and you know the fact that brain activity diminishes even while the intensity of
what the person is experiencing goes through the roof suggests to us that um yeah the brain the nervous
system is kind of a filter and it is actually not in the business of producing consciousness but inhibiting
consciousness um stepping it down to a level that we can manage and when we take a psychedelic it just
blows the lid off whereas i'll just huxley but he's really getting it from the french philosopher
um henry bergson this idea of the brain as a kind of reducing valve and psychedelics open the valve and allow
mind at large to flood in i think that's what the evidence would suggest the more appropriate model
is for understanding the mind brain relationship mind and consciousness are more like this field
that we tune into that the nervous system is a kind of antenna or radio receiver rather than a local
producer of consciousness and it you we wouldn't come to that perspective unless we had been exposed to
psychedelics and been able to experiment with these things so yeah they're tremendously valuable research
tool and i i really advocate for thinking beyond just the medical model for their application um
um i i i'm i am quite adamant that all adults should be able to uh legally use the classical psychedelics
they're way less dangerous than sugar and alcohol and tobacco and um and many pharmaceutical drugs um yeah
yeah that's the only reason there's there's cultural and moral reasons rooted in a kind of
political religious history that you know originally led to these things being made illegal i think
and the political implications in the 60s that you know the it was political revolutionaries who were
using these things a lot strangely i think there's a lot of arguments that psychedelics depoliticized the
more radical political movements in the 60s because people did turn inward instead of trying to change
institutions yeah so there's a critique there implicit maybe in in at least the um historical
um effects of psychedelics uh i think there are ways that they could be politically revolutionary but they
at least in the 60s were critiqued a lot for depoliticizing people
but yeah it's a very promising area of research and i think as a philosopher i find psychedelics to be quite
quite powerful instruments for metaphysical exploration yeah and this might seem a little
bit left field but um do you think do you think cryptocurrency has anything to do with this sort of
you know this this idea it will move movement towards decentralization of power and sort of more
kind of organic systems of organic economies and so on do you think crypto's got anything to do with that
possibly or particularly bitcoin you know just set aside the old coins but bitcoin you know this this
idea that it's it's something you can actually own that can't be meddled with by the banks or
governments and so on so is that part of this journey this awakening it might be i think we have to find
ways of um mining and maintaining the blockchain that isn't so resource intensive but there are there are
avenues for doing that that are that are promising but um i think as a way of decentralizing economic power
um taking some of the uh power away from centralized banks um i think that's a very promising avenue um
um it's such a complicated subject i think this idea of like a trust-free economy like you don't need
to trust people to follow through with their transactions and stuff because the algorithm will do
it um you know i know you know bitcoin doesn't have smart contracts but like something like ethereum
where you can just automate something that you would need a team of lawyers to do normally in terms of
what's when aspects clauses of a contract are activated by this or that change in the market
or whatever that can all be um built into the blockchain in a way and so you don't need to trust
people to do what they say they're going to do it's as soon as you agree to the contract that's what's
going to happen but like i just feel like i'm not opposed to using technologies to make our economy
um function in a more transparent and distributed way but at the same time should we celebrate the idea
that we don't need to trust each other anymore like i feel like that's a bit it's a bit antisocial
um and i i think blockchain technology can play an important role in helping us reimagine money
um but bitcoin's weird because it's not really functioning as a currency it's too valuable to function
as a currency um and so the original i think um point of it has been lost and it's become more like
an investment yeah and where this is leading i'm not sure but it could be that it's not bitcoin that ends
up being the platform uh but the basic idea of blockchain and of like a world computer and you know
massively distributing um the ledger to increase the transparency of economic transactions i think
these are all positive things um it would be great if we could uh you know in the us when we vote when
we have our elections um we're using paper ballots and people say oh that's safer but it's still so
easily manipulated and if we could just get this on the blockchain and people could vote on their phones
or whatever it'd be so much i mean i think we'd increase voter participation and i feel like
there's so many applications for the blockchain technology goes far beyond just bitcoin or ethereum
or particular um applications right so yeah i think this it's a promising development that i'm curious
to see unfold that's really interesting what you said there it's kind of it's emerged from the fact
that we have problems trusting each other right so it's emerged as a kind of response to that
but yes it does take away that choice of being a good person doesn't it so it takes away the
opportunity to do the right thing in some sense that's that's quite interesting um just conscious
of time here matt um i think you've got a few minutes left so just to say thanks so much for
coming to talk to me um you make philosophy cool um you're one of a bunch of guys that do that i have
you in there sort of with castrop and you know philip goff you're making it accessible you speak
calmly clearly and intelligently on these topics and it's just a massive pleasure and privilege to
have you so thank you yeah no it's been fun matt you ask great questions and uh yeah i hope it's
valuable for your your listeners thank you very much it's been wonderful um hopefully we speak again
sometime i'd like that cheers man take care all right happy new year and to you
