in this episode me a materialism ultimately does have to posit nature uh as ontological ground zero
so really not just a materialism but a naturalism um a naturalist metaphysics that argues that you
know indeed you know at least for us given our epistemological constraints the ultimate ontological
ground zero is you know pre or non-human nature in another itself and that this nature gives rise to
is is responsible for the very genesis of among other things ourselves as subjects um and of course
here one of my historical sources of inspiration is the shelling of the late 1790s and early 1800s
he starts you know trying to develop after kant what he and hegel uh uh called natua philosophy
philosophy of nature and that the shelling of a text like 1800 system of transcendental idealism
argues that well on the one hand epistemologically speaking we have to start like kant does with this
you know framework of transcendental subjectivity um that you know determines the possibility of
of knowledge for us of what you know can be rendered intelligible what we are able to grasp etc with
our concepts categories and the like um and so if you you are talking about knowledge or thinking
you have to you know start at the level of the transcendental subject and then from there you
move towards the domain of objectivity but an objectivity whose intelligibility is conditioned by
our own subjectivity but then of course shelling insists though that that by itself is one-sided
and that this needs to be supplemented by if you start instead from the level of not epistemology
but ontology then you have to account for how this very knowing subject how transcendental subjectivity
itself somehow arose out of nature um and that that task of thinking the you know the imminent natural
genesis of transcendental subjectivity um is in a way kind of the key task that an issue that i think is
bequeathed to philosophy by post-kanti and german idealism especially alaf uh schelling and hegel
and that is you know really the big problem that i am working on myself under the heading of of of
transcendental materialism or i even sometimes speak of dialectical naturalism the idea that nature in a
sense denaturalizes itself or generates something that you know can act uh in in defiance of how the
rest of nature operates um and that we are precisely self-denaturalized nature relating to itself and
accounting for that genesis for the imminent material natural genesis of a of a form of subjectivity that
itself cannot simply be reduced to its natural material origins and that moreover can achieve
at least a certain degree of freedom wiggle room or autonomy vis-a-vis its material natural ground
hey everyone welcome to my conversation with the philosopher professor adrian johnston
firstly to get it out of the way let me start off by apologizing uh apologizing for if i didn't do
the best job as an interviewer i felt like in the podcast i was a little bit nervous uh and didn't
really do the best job at extracting um the best one could from uh talking to a a thinker like professor
johnston uh and i've got to admit the reason for that is because i was nervous in fact i i don't i
rarely do get nervous with podcasts i generally find them to be a just another conversation uh but
um at the risk of uh embarrassing professor johnston if i may say i have considered him to be a a
philosophical hero of mine um i started reading him probably four or five years ago uh with his book um
zizek's ontology and i was immediately hooked onto his his style of writing his his mo when it comes to
philosophy and just the way that he bridges uh myriad fields in both continental and analytic philosophy
and brings in um cognitive neuroscience uh and many other disciplines along with of course the discourse
around psychoanalysis and marxism and i've learned so much from him and i've read so much of his work
quite carefully if i'm being frank and i felt that i was kind of overwhelmed with the amount of
questions i wanted to ask him and and sort of all of the numerous thoughts i've had in my head while
reading him and i felt in this moment i had to synthesize it all and and ask him clear cogent
questions and that i felt like i put a lot of undue pressure on myself and in no way was this professor
johnson's fault and in fact uh he was very cordial and congenial and um and i i felt like he just truly
engaged with my questions in a deep and perspicacious manner and i hope i i did a good job as an
interlocutor but be that as it may it's just a bit of a caveat for you the listener if i didn't really do
a good job um but what i primarily want to discuss with this conversation was the theory of materialism
that professor johnson advocates for uh the transcendental materialist theory which um to
put it simply is a way of trying to understand um how the subject emerges from the objects but also
the fact that the subject can be reduced to the object on emergence um and then the question would be
what is nature like that it can give rise to subjects to conscious beings um and certainly this
is heavily influenced by hegel and schelling for myself the reason i was particularly drawn towards
professor johnston's work is that he would still clearly delineate the subject and the object not
particularly in a dualistic cartesian way it was a bit more complicated than that however perhaps in a
more dialectical way where he would still say that there is a difference between subjects and objects
between us conscious beings and then the objective non-conscious world whereas as we discuss in the
podcast people like panpsychists or analytic idealists uh tend to prescribe subjectivity or
consciousness to all of being all of existence and personally for myself i always was kind of turned
off by that kind of thinking because i felt there wasn't um many productive dialogue that can emerge
from or come out of uh such uh all-encompassing ontologies whereas the uh transcendental ontology
the transcendental materials ontology for myself at least is deeply hegelian and deeply dialectical which
is perhaps important uh when we when we theorize uh as as a philosopher uh or as a lay philosopher like
myself so it's with this intent that i approach this conversation where i really try to bring forward
professor johnston's theory of materialism uh transcendental materialism which is where we went
into you know quantum mechanics his uh critique of zizek zizek's use of quantum mechanics which is very
interesting i mean he's spoken about this in a couple episodes and a couple of podcasts uh i should
say uh but i still find it's quite productive whenever he does critique zizek and i was happy to hear
that uh he is writing or collaborating on a book with uh slavo zizek uh to discuss these matters a bit
more deeply um and on that note i want to mention this too that he's done some great work with katherine
malibu um i haven't studied katherine malibu's work much but i'm really hoping to next year to read uh
more of her work especially uh in the cognitive neurosciences uh with neuroplasticity and then her
connection how she connects that to more of a hegilian philosophy uh so i'm really keen to look
into that and in fact even read uh the book that professor johnston wrote wrote with uh professor
katherine malibu uh i i ordered the book but it just didn't arrive in time but i certainly am hoping to
read it when it arrives uh one small thing to mention perhaps if this if this really matters for for you
more the listeners of this podcast would be i did mention professor johnston that um i i'm hoping to
start a book club uh next year um i've already been in contact with a few listeners but eventually
we will open it up to the public and one book uh we are hoping to study deeply is professor johnson's
book uh adventures in transcendental materialism which uh i haven't read the whole book i've skimmed
through it but have to having read you know jesus ontology uh the new german idealism and then even
um professor johnson's essay in this book uh this collection uh direct response i can't wait to get
into um especially because he did mention that he just fleshed out his disagreement with jack apropos
quantum mechanics i don't want to prolong this introduction too much but my overall point being
primarily in this podcast i wanted to focus on professor johnston's ontology his materialist ontology
that he puts forward uh and not particularly on more of his scholarly work on lacone and psychoanalysis
but that certainly is a whole other area which he's written on extensively um now for a bit of a
formal introduction as i tend to do professor adrian johnson is a distinguished professor in the
department of philosophy at the university of new mexico at albuquerque and a faculty member at the emory
psychoanalytic institute in atlanta he's the author of numerous books including zizek's ontology
new german idealism the prolegomena to any future materialism trilogy and recently infinite greed
professor johnston is in continuous dialogue with his fellow travelers slavoj zizek alanka supancic
katherine malibu tom mcgovern and others in the contemporary hegelian lacanian theory scene while also
bringing into the discourse the developments within analytic philosophy and the natural sciences that
being said without further ado here's my conversation with professor arian johnston obviously as i said
before before we started recording thank you very much for your time it's truly an honor um i i guess
i'd start off with a very broad question which you probably have been asked uh in previous interviews
before uh in in a conversation you had with daniel tutt who is also another thing i deeply admire
uh he he he said this and i think even uh katherine malibu i've seen uh her say this too that you've
been you've been vital and or pivotal in uh bridging the gap between so-called uh analytic and carnal
philosophy and you know as a neophyte reading your work i've always felt this too um and i'm wondering
if you could if you firstly do you agree with this this is this claim about yourself but also if you do uh
how do you think you've done uh in your work there's this this bridging between um analytic and carnal
philosopher a philosophy and then what has your mo been in in doing so so i should start by saying i'm
very comfortable with being characterized thusly um this is in part reflective of the fact that uh you
know my my father was actually trained as an analytic philosopher and so you know from childhood
onward i had uh regular conversations with someone about these issues who was coming out of uh uh you
know a strictly analytic background my father's dissertation was on quine you know specifically
quines two dogmas of empiricism and its implications for practical philosophy for ethics etc um and you
know my interest in things like the mind body problem materialism uh you know theories of subjectivity
etc uh definitely have some of their origins uh in you know that aspect of my upbringing so that's
you know one factor and funnily enough when i was originally hired by the university of new mexico
and it's been gosh it's been longer than i realized this was uh in 2006 when i joined the
department the job description uh for the position i ended up getting here was somebody who is a
continental philosopher but nonetheless very comfortable talking to analytic types um and that was in fact
just part of the job description and so you know it ended up working out that i you know got the
position um but apart from that in terms of you know how i see myself bridging this divide and i'm
certainly not alone in this there are you know various you know effort being made i think to um
you know get these two philosophical traditions seriously engaging with each other nowadays but
you know for me there's both a style and a content component um at the stylistic level uh you know i i
i try my best to to write in a way that involves uh you know clarity that involves argumentative rigor
you know various of these things that analytic philosophers place a premium on and you know my
hope is always that the things that i write even if i'm writing about very continental figures such as
hegel or lacan that i'm still able to write about authors like that in a fashion that opens up their
ideas to those who don't come from continental backgrounds and aren't necessarily you know versed
in the particular technical vocabularies of these you know specific european figures um so that that's
a stylistic aspect and i think that again the analytic philosophical premium on um you know clarity
rigor lack of reliance on obscure jargon etc you know those things you know i also tried to take to
heart you know in terms of my own writing but content wise i mean many of the um metaphysical
and philosophy of mind issues that i'm most concerned with things having to do with materialism the mind
body relationship etc you know these are readily recognizable central philosophical questions for
just about any philosopher including any analytic philosopher um i use a different toolkit than
your standard analytic philosopher to deal with questions in metaphysics or philosophy of mind
but many of the questions and concerns um are very much the same and my hope is uh is that approaching
um things that are of concern to analytic philosophical types but again with with figures orientations
resources etc that usually analytic philosophers are not trained in or not you know inclined to reach for
themselves when wrestling with certain issues you know things like psychoanalysis marxism um
post-kantian german idealism i mean these are orientations that i think are of great use for
these big philosophical questions that even the analytics readily recognize are the big philosophical
questions still um but you know most analytics or education in the history of philosophy stops with a
certain version of kant um they then generally tend to think after kant the europeans went insane
you know the post-kantian idealist just went off the speculative deep end um and it was just a big
intellectual mess or catastrophe for most of the 19th century um and then you know at the start of the
20th century um you know sanity is recovered with you know frego russell wittgenstein and company um and i think
that so much of what occurs in that 19th century gap between kant and russell and company uh that
tends to be overlooked in analytic philosophy is actually it contains much that i think uh can be
demonstrated even to analytic philosophers much that is useful for dealing with issues in metaphysics
and philosophy of mind that they're dealing with excellent professor uh in fact maybe perhaps as an
example since we were just talking about uh your recent book infinite greed um yeah maybe if you
could like so for a bit of context uh a lot of the uh listeners of this podcast still tend to be more
from the analytic camp more from the the cognitive science background and and some of them um are
actively averse to let's say psychoanalysis or they would be they would be more like let's say agnostic
about it they would know what it's all about so if you could use your you know recent book uh infinite
agreed agreed agreed as an example and then perhaps uh kind of try to elucidate why why is it what what
would you say are the what's the value in in fields in discourses such as psychoanalysis to a field uh
more from the analytic tradition like something like cognitive science or more like the analytics
philosophy of mind yes well i would say that you know in terms of psychoanalysis both traditional
psychoanalysis uh figures such as freud and lacan but also of course some of my work looks at um
contemporary psychoanalysis vis-a-vis the current state of play in the neurosciences and there's a
whole field known as neuropsychoanalysis that you know i'm also very much engaged with and you know it's
mainly non-lacanian psychoanalysis but there are a few lacanians such as myself who also have interests in
in neuropsychoanalysis but i would say that at the biggest of big picture levels um if you take
psychoanalysis as as the point of reference here um you know to begin with i think that freud very
much like marx and nietzsche before him that it is not without very good reason that the french
hermeneutic philosopher paul racour famously describes marx nietzsche and freud as quote unquote the
three great hermeneuts of suspicion um and you know in freud's case of course that suspicion has
everything to do with the specifically psychoanalytic conception of the unconscious um and that of course
uh freud when advancing his analytic conception of the unconscious from very early on in his career
was aware of having to fight against a deeply entrenched bias that you also see very much reflected
in the western philosophical tradition that tends to equate the mental with the conscious and to view
those two things as co-extensive or synonymous um and of course one of freud's revolutionary gestures
is to insist that no that it is not always the case that when we think we think that we think or
that when we know we know that we know that there isn't that guarantee of accompanying self-aware
reflexivity such that all that is mental is conscious um that in fact you know the conscious
portion of mental life is just the tip of a vast iceberg and that moreover for freud it's not that
what is you know below the threshold of our explicit self-awareness is just a chaotic primitive animalistic
uh you know seething cauldron of impulses and urges a la you know kind of a depth psychological
romantic conception of the freudian id is that the unconscious involves very complex
cognitive processes but that transpire without accompanying first person conscious cognizance
or self-awareness right and at the time freud was proposing this it was very controversial and went
against um the grain of certain traditional intuitions about mental life um but now what
what's surprising is that despite freud repeatedly being pronounced dead and buried you know intellectually
obsolete bankrupt etc one of the things that is has is a lasting legacy of his is that even anti-freudians
like hard nose a limited materialist neuroscience types um it's really at this point uncontroversial
that much of mental life is non-conscious you know whether unconscious in freud sense that might be
more debatable but really there's no serious um empirical scientific disagreement that no in fact
the mental and the conscious are far from synonymous or co-extensive and that indeed the mental vastly
exceeds in scope the relatively narrow and restricted parameters of the field of our conscious awareness and
so you know that's something which you know freud had to argue for that now has been accepted just
and has been accepted even by those who have no truck with freud who are allergic or averse to him
etc etc and when you take seriously the idea that the mental and the conscious are not co-extensive and
that most of mental life is it transpires below the threshold of explicit self-awareness standard
philosophical models of the you know libertarian free-willed you know reflective deliberating
agent that backs rationally on the basis of an accurate assessment of its own self-interest etc
something crucial for so much not just of philosophy but you know for you know you might say world views
outlooks etc that shape our laws our institutions our social practices etc and one of the things that
psychoanalysis and its aftermath in you know in our models of the mind up through the present
that indicates is that that entire you know basically early modern picture of the self as agent
the rational individual who reflectively deliberates about their interests and may is able to know you
know what will for instance satisfy them make them happy etc and then setting about doing that in the
most practical way possible blah blah blah all of that it just seems like frankly a wishful thinking
fiction right a distorted picture of ourselves that has long ago has been demolished by not just freud i
mean you know again before and marks and nietzsche do quite a bit of damage to that idea of the self or
or of the you know rational agent and you know and and then you know up through the present you have
all of this you know frankly empirical experimental natural scientific corroboration that aspects of
what is is detrimental to this you know picture of of you know the the free willed you know choosing
rational agent that's central to you know liberalism to capitalism to you know the entire social order we
inhabit is again a basically a myth of fiction of falsehood um and so you know part of what i try
to do in my work in various ways is to draw attention to that now the other thing is is with cognitivist
types like so one one issue when we're talking especially about uh the neurosciences is that
we have to remember that cognitivism is also not co-extensive with all the neurosciences sometimes
people get the impression that research programs that come out of a cognitivist orientation um in
the sciences of the brain are the only game in town when in fact um there since the 1990s especially
there's been enormous amount of work done in an area now known as affective neuroscience with some of the
pioneering figures here being yak punksepp antonio damasio joseph ledue um you know there's a range of
authors working in that orientation where what one looks at is not um you know so much the brain's
manner of processing you know let's say you know symbols concepts etc uh you know making inferences
so on and so forth but that what's actually of concern to affective neuroscience is of course
looking at how emotional and feeling states are very decisive for who and what we are as the
peculiar beings that we human beings are and um you know the the whole you know research set of research
programs that are ongoing and affective neuroscience are proving to be particularly congenial to uh those
interested in neuropsychoanalysis and in bringing um you know freudian and other analytic metapsychologies
into a kind of cooperative relationship with uh neurobiology and its findings um and that you know
in fact you know the person here who i think has done you know the most in this regard who's often
considered the founder of anglo-american neuropsychoanalysis is mark solmes and in his
recent big book uh the hidden spring from 2021 i think he does a marvelous job showing how a combination
of psychoanalysis and affective neuroscience enables addressing like one of the things he
focuses on in that book is david chalmers's famous hard problem of consciousness and tackling
that with this different toolbox drawn from this combination of freudian psychoanalysis with affective
rather than cognitive neuroscience um as just like a nice example of of what an effort along these
lines looks like that's you know and this book is quite recent from 2021 and you know highly recommended
really well worth reading to kind of flesh out some of this perfect perfect yeah i also particularly
like what you said about the fact that the the unconscious it's not this sort of chaotic this it's
rather it's got logic because i'd say uh like a lot of uh you know non-experts neophytes who get into
psychoanalysis it tends to be through generally by by jungian depth psychology and then you see
the ego and then the the iceberg metaphor where behind the scenes it's like this chaotic mess of like
of of the id whereas with more for the lacanian tradition it's like it's got its own logic and i think
it's it's important to understand that uh in fact professor i wasn't going to ask you this but since you
mentioned it i think it's it's an apt point um you know todd mcgovern one of your fellow travelers he
he beautifully articulates this idea of the the politics of the death drive the Freudian death
drive and i'm curious just to hear your thoughts on this this idea of the politics of the death
drive whenever i speak to anyone from a psychoanalytic background i do i'd like to ask that question
given i think it's something important for the discourse um so yeah what are your what are your
thoughts on this idea of the the politics of the death drive my tendency is to want to say that well
there can be various ways of politically of appropriating and deploying the psychoanalytic
notion of the death drive um but of course you know even there it's already complicated in terms of
you know if you look at the later freud starting in 1920 with beyond the pleasure principle the text in
which freud first introduces what at that moment he presents as a highly speculative hypothesis and
you know he's extremely hesitant and and cagey in that work uh but he puts forward this this idea of the
totus tree but the death drive and then if you carefully uh examine the elaborations on this notion
that freud engages in from 1920 you know to the end of his life in the late 1930s honestly i think one
would be hard-pressed to say that there is a single enduring coherent well-defined concept there instead
you have a shifting series of proposals some of which hang together others i don't think hang together
too well and that in the later freud death drive almost names a set of unresolved problems or
difficulties that freud is focused on orbiting around etc but i don't think ever manages to fully
you know nail down or tie up to his satisfaction um and you know then you have of course certain
interpretations what the death drive is in the lacanian camp etc and you know to begin with for
me it's very difficult because i don't think there's any interpretive consensus on exactly what
the correct account of the death drive is in freud and or lacan um but regardless of those interpretive
difficulties for me the death drive like you know or any other freud's fundamental metapsychological
concepts can i think be you know appropriated deployed etc politically but i don't think there's
any kind of inherent there's no politics inherent to the metapsychology itself that's just there to
be directly read off of it um that you know if you take for instance any number of the characteristics
associated with the death drive well we could talk about for instance you know aggression indifference to
the pleasure principle etc as operative in various political phenomena situated anywhere across the
spectrum um you know whether on the right or the left etc um and so um you know i i do tend to be
myself um a little hesitant to talk about you know the the politics of the death drive well which politics
um you know again i don't think that i think that instead something like freudian drive theory or
lucanian drive theory for that matter as a metapsychological framework can be productively utilized to
explain um and an account for certain political phenomena that we observe i mean in my recent book
infinite greed you know looking at latinian accounts of drive and desire as relevant to understanding what
marx talks about as the logic of capital in terms of the fundamental um kind of motivational structure
of the capitalist mode of production at a trans individual uh you know social level um but uh you
know the death you know and there something like the death drive is helpful for understanding aspects
of the logic of capital but it also of course can be helpful for understanding instances that might
involve radical left revolutionary sequences at different in different times and places in history
etc so you know my my position has always been that you know metapsychology and politics are two
different things that you know you can map them on to each other but um i i always resist efforts to
talk about any kind of inherent political upshot uh you know message or conclusion built into
the structure of psychoanalytic metapsychology i don't think that metapsychology itself is inherently
political i think it can be used in political analysis but that's to me something different i'm not
sure if that answers the question or not but you know well yeah i claim that it's not normative in the
sense that you don't want to prescribe any kind of yeah perfect perfect yeah yeah that's right it's purely
descriptive i mean given its pure descriptive nature there's a neutrality to it at the prescriptive
level i mean there's no yeah you can't just read off anything normative or prescriptive directly from
it i see perfect perfect thank you for clarifying the professor all right uh i want to talk about
uh transcendental materialism in fact uh i am hoping to do your book uh adventures in transcendental
materialism in a small book club that i run and we are hopefully hoping uh starting next year maybe
around jan feb to do a book study on that but however i came across uh the term in uh your your
book rejects ontology um in the first book i read by you um in fact a couple years ago so i've kind of
forgotten most of it uh nonetheless uh if you could i have two oh yes you are you happy yeah there you
go well it's a good thing you've written it down then you you have some record of that's right
that's right uh well uh in any case um yeah if you could so you know this for me it really when
you introduce your theory of materialism it i i felt like this is it this is exactly what i've always
thought about this idea of your subject object divide and especially i don't know if you've been
following again from the analytic tradition there's a lot of talk of you know discourse around there's
like a resurgence of panpsychism or yes but you know the kind of idealism where everything is
consciousness or a lot of discourse but i realize that there's it's always something that that misses
where i feel like i feel like that captures i feel like a transcendental materialism does capture that
bit that bit that it misses within this you know the so-called object subject divide but uh yeah if
you could just uh explicate to a person who has no idea what uh transcendental materialism is and we'll
go from there because i kind of want to explore uh that once you flush it out i kind of want to discuss
how it differs from let's say kind of rejects ontology or if it differs at all yes well i should say
that to begin with the origin of the very phrase transcendental materialism traces back to that
2008 book zizek's ontology that you just mentioned right um and um it uh i i ended up uh uh resorting to
this particular phrase to at the time try and characterize zizek's own core philosophical position
with with this label uh you know given that you know on the one hand zizek repeatedly from you know
some of his earliest work onward makes clear that he is interested in establishing a materialist ontology
and that more in in the past 10 to 15 years you know he's tended to even associate that with you know
despite the problematic stalinist connotations with the phrase dialectical materialism and to
you know appeal to that tradition um so on the one hand he is interested in arguing for a materialist
ontology but one that contains within itself a theory of subjectivity where the subject is seen as
irreducible to this material basis of being that you know he is ontologically committed to as fundamental
and that moreover um very much resembles the sort of subjectivity that we often think of as associated
with anti-materialist idealisms for example the cartesian cogito you know or something like for
for instance in the german idealist context fita's self-positing i etc um that you know zizek once on the
one hand uh as i portray them in in that 2008 book a theory of cogito like subjectivity of um you know an
irreducible autonomous you know not itself just physical not one object among others uh a subject
that nonetheless um is somehow accounted for within the parameters of an overarching materialist ontology
oh hold on my one of my apple uh devices thought that i was talking to it and started speaking to
me and distracted me all right don't worry about that so but um and and so uh to cut uh at this point
a very long story very short um you know so i have ended up in certain ways taking over this label
um but developing on under the banner of transcendental materialism a position which now i mean zizek and
i have been back and forth in recent years debating about some of these issues um and one thing i'm
going to be working on in the next couple of years is he and i have decided to do a co-author debate book
together about some of these matters um but you know for me basically the what i am now trying to work
out uh under the heading of transcendental materialism however useful or not that label is um what i'm
trying to work out is a model where you can account for not uh and really for me a materialism ultimately
does have to posit nature uh as ontological ground zero so really not just a materialism but a naturalism
um a naturalist metaphysics that argues that you know indeed you know at least for us given our
epistemological constraints the ultimate ontological ground zero is you know pre or non-human nature in
and of itself and that this nature gives rise to is is responsible for the very genesis of among other
things ourselves as subjects um and of course here one of my historical sources of inspiration
is the shelling of the late 1790s and early 1800s he starts you know trying to develop after kant
what he and hegel uh uh called natua philosophy philosophy of nature and that the shelling of a
text like 1800 system of transcendental idealism argues that well on the one hand epistemologically
speaking we have to start like kant does with this you know framework of transcendental subjectivity
um that you know determines the possibility of of knowledge for us of what you know can be rendered
intelligible what we are able to grasp etc with our concepts categories and the like um and so if you
are you are talking about knowledge or thinking you have to you know start at the level of the
transcendental subject and then from there you move towards the domain of objectivity but an objectivity
whose intelligibility is conditioned by our own subjectivity but then of course shelling insists
though that that by itself is one-sided and that this needs to be supplemented by if you start instead
from the level of not epistemology but ontology then you have to account for how this very knowing
subject how transcendental subjectivity itself somehow arose out of nature um and that that task of
thinking the you know the imminent natural genesis of transcendental subjectivity um is in a way kind of
the key task that an issue that i think is bequeathed to philosophy by post-kanti and german idealism
especially alaf uh shelling and hegel and that is you know really the big problem that i am working on
myself under the heading of of of transcendental materialism or i even sometimes speak of dialectical
naturalism the idea that nature in a sense denaturalizes itself or generate something that you know can
act uh in in defiance of how the rest of nature operates um and that we are precisely self-denaturalized
nature relating to itself and accounting for that genesis for the imminent material natural genesis of
of a form of subjectivity that itself cannot simply be reduced to its natural material origins and that
moreover can achieve at least a certain degree of freedom wiggle room or autonomy vis-a-vis its material
natural ground you know that's that's really the the you might say the biggest philosophical
preoccupation of what you know i'm pursuing and i think zizek is after that in his own way too but
he has a very at this point i think a very different way of doing it for me
um so you could say that what he and i share is more a problem or a concern um and we also of course share
you know very similar tools for dealing with it this combination of german idealism marxism and
psychoanalysis with some other philosophical resources but i think that the different pictures
that we we come to you know champion each of us at this point um you know are very distinct options
from each other and so that's some of what we're hoping to you know to be able to lay out more clearly
in this in this book that we'll both be tinkering on for the next couple of years well perfect i'd
certainly be pre-ordering that whenever it's our professor um that's so beautifully escalated um
although although before i would like to flesh out a bit more your differences between zizek and
how you're tackling this problem uh but if you could let's say uh devil's advocate a bit um so a lot
of people recently have been buying into the idea of pan-psychism so in many ways what i see is
because from the objects the subject emerges and the subject can't be reduced to the object on
emergence they tend to prescribe to this object some kind of properties of a of a subject so they say
every entity in the universe in some way is conscious um so how will you respond to a panpsychist
uh through your uh theory of uh transcendental materialism or dialectical naturalism and where
do you think uh that that theory that ontology of pan-psychism is lacking yeah i what's interesting
is i've also been thinking about some of this recently in part thanks to a few of my doctoral
students for example um i had one who recently defended a dissertation on shelling the early shellings
philosophy of nature and the way david chalmers talks about panpsychism um in in his work on
philosophy of mind um and you know with using chalmers here as a as a convenient reference and
you know someone whose work you know especially if you have a good number of analytic listeners
you know most of them would be at least passingly familiar with um what i'm about to say is you know
just like with freud and beyond the pleasure principle highly tentative but i've become
increasingly tempted by an aspect of chalmers's approach which i think
expresses can you know the same sort of concerns that motivate some people now to turn to panpsychism
but doesn't require actually buying into full-blown panpsychism um so you know i should begin by
saying i don't find full-blown panpsychism at all persuasive i mean you can start just at a very naive
commonsensical level which is that you know in terms of what prompts any of us to attribute mindedness
to something uh that that we come across you know that you know why i for instance ascribe mindedness
to you while talking to you right now despite just being limited to having this image on my computer
screen you know and all of this sensory perceptual content that i could just attribute to my own mind
if i were say a solipsis um that you know of course when we when we posit the existence however
explicitly or implicitly of other minds we do so because we're prompted by what we take to
be evidence expressive of you know some mindedness on that side you know that you react to me in
certain ways that you engage in particular behaviors that seem to be purposive and directed towards a
specific aim and or goal that you know you you you have reactions that seem to indicate feeling states
that i'm familiar with in myself etc and so that leads me to you know attribute a mind to you and of
course you know you know when it comes to what we experience as inanimate nature writ large um you
know it doesn't seem like we have very good reason for thinking that you know the desk on which my
computer sits right now is itself minded i don't think even at a commonsensical level but then um you
know when you start getting into more scientifically informed empirical details right um you know that there
does and here's where for me it is always important to keep of the natural scientific references biology
and especially neurobiology in mind that the kinds of you know the forms of of experience of mindedness
of subjectivity that we have as far as we know does require a highly complex type of object the kind of
peculiar entity that is the human central nervous system in all of its mind-boggling you know astronomical
complexity right and you know that does seem to be you know you know it's i i certainly am open to
the idea of multiple realizability i think that there are various physical systems that you know could
potentially or actually instantiate something that we might be willing to qualify as mindedness um but i
certainly don't think that you know any old bunch of atoms you know molecules etc you know are going to
generate that so i think that mindedness is not universally distributed across all of material
reality across the entire physical universe i don't really see any compelling reason to accept that and
in fact you know i see a lot of both commonsensical and scientific reasons to believe that no um there
are only you know these very small isolated instances of material configurations in nature that support
mindedness for instance you know the central nervous systems of various organisms that we know of
right um but what i like about uh uh you know chalmers in dealing with the hard problem of consciousness
in this vein is that his work allows for the possibility of saying well the thing is is that
you know qualitative consciousness right this this experience of qualia as as chalmers you know
highlights in his in his account of the hard problem of consciousness that chalmers speculation that
you know perhaps you know the what it is like of various qualia are you know fundament they're just
you know brute fundamental facts of nature along with other things um you know and that um and but that
of course these facts of nature that are qualia and unlike with panpsychism are not just universally
equitably equitably equitably distributed across the entire expanse of the of the physical universe
or of all of material natural reality um that you have you know these discrete small localized pockets
where qualia arise and that qualia although they emerge from certain physical systems that um you know
at least as far as our understanding can get that maybe there is this spade turning quality to them
in terms of well you know why is it that you know a certain you know wavelength of light
has the quality of the qualitative quality to us i'm sorry quality you know is a quality or has this
sort of feel to it of what it is like to see a certain shade of red right and that you know it may
be that there isn't any further explanation that can be offered there we just have to take it as
it's just a brute stupid fact of nature like any other fact of nature that it just so happens that
in a physical being with a central nervous system configured like ours that you know the the visual
apparatus encountering this wavelength of light will generate this corresponding qualitative state of
consciousness that is the quality of that shade of red right and that that is there's just a certain
ultimate um you know just brute facticity of the matter to it um that we're perfectly comfortable
accepting about various and sundry laws of nature etc and that i think chalmers proposal that you know
there might just be these brute factual uh uh relationships between say certain wavelengths on the light
spectrum and certain you know visual qualitative experiences that's just another one of those brute
facts of nature uh and that you know at that point um you know we can of course draw the parallels in
terms of you know certain aspects of how our central nervous system functions and those corresponding
qualitative states of conscious awareness um but that you know at that point perhaps our job is more or
less done um that again there is that spade turning quality it's just well it is what it is and even the
same way that any other aspect of nature is what it is um and you know so i think that that's you know
not when chalmers uh you know uh is willing to speculate about full-blown panpsychism but rather when
you know he's willing to say that like the panpsychist consciousness might just be something fundamental
to to nature or a fundamental aspect of nature but then there's the option of you don't have to if you
accept that you don't have to end up as a panpsychist where you just evenly distribute that across the
entire expanse of what exists at the physical level but just say only certain a certain set of physical
configurations are able to have you know corresponding with them these also primitive natural states that
are quality excellent excellent and i think yeah i can see your your punch on towards that sort of
thinking because especially when you when you post that it's a brute fact of reality that's also very
naturalist it's it's yeah it's it's there's no further explanation requirements so it is it is what
it is as you said uh yes right right uh well professor so now to kind of flesh out your differences and
kind of this ongoing debate with the zizek now of course uh zizek kind of puts forward this idea of
ontological incompleteness which is also something that i'm fully fully drawn towards um so i i was
trying to prepare for this conversation and i i read zizek's book on freedom uh a couple of months
yes then i there's one one part here if you don't mind if i could just read it out he he says in the
book uh freedom a disease without kill uh being involved in a decades-long debate with adrian johnston
i gladly accept his designation of a difference as one between uh layer cake and doughnut in your
ontology yes uh and then uh you also did uh write a write a little uh have a bit of a debate with him
in this uh book zizek response which is an excellent yes uh read uh read to this debate between uh cake
and doughnut yeah so if you could take as as much time as you need for this because i find it fascinating
and kind of try to outline uh these ontological differences between the doughnut model and the
the cake layer cake model between yourself and zizek yes well i should say that with with
with zizek so starting in 1996 and that year he he brings out um his book the indivisible remainder
an essay on shelling and related matters and one of the you know striking and novel features of that
particular work from the mid-1990s is that this was the first time the initial occasion when um when
zizek uh uh attempted to uh use his at that point primarily his combination of german idealism with
lacan and in this case more more precisely uh sort of lacanian shelling to engage with quantum physics um
and so this this gesture of taking recourse to quantum physics for fleshing out a particular sort of
materialism that would involve this this idea of ontological incompleteness etc um this is really
the first place where you see zizek do that um and then more recently um it's as though that project
from the indivisible remainder has over the course of the past i'd say probably about 15 years returned
with a vengeance in his uh in his you know more recent work where you know he now talks about his his
version of dialectical materialism as essentially involving this particular hybrid german idealist
lacanian manner of engaging with quantum physics for instance you know his 2020 book sex in the failed
absolute um is his i think most recent sustained presentation of that and in fact right now he's
back to working on quantum physics again and has been in conversation with a number of you know eminent
figures in that field um and it's very yes that's right and so yeah he's in the middle of working
on all of that right now um but uh one aspect of of the cape versus donut model that you're talking
about has to do with how in debating with him about some of these issues one of the things that i did
is go back to shelley himself um and you know looking at uh you know shellings philosophy of nature
and related aspects of shellings larger for lack of a better word metaphysics um that you know it
became very clear to me that was shelling shellings account of of autonomous subjectivity of of you know
the subject in its fullest freedom um as concerned zizek that shelling makes clear that for him what
this is a matter of is so shelling and this is you know this is material crucial to zizek's version of
shelley the middle period shelling starting with shellings 1809 freiheit schrift his essay on human
freedom and running through the ages of the world up to around 1815 or thereabouts that this middle
period shelling especially is dear to zizek and this shelling has this distinction that zizek uses
again and again between ground glute and existence existence um and this ground existence distinction
you know for shelling the ideas is that what we ordinarily take to be reality is what he calls
existence which is this tamed and domesticated um you know field of constituted entities and events
um that is organized in a lawful fashion that is intelligible for us you know as knowing subjects
um that we are able to cognitively map you know get our bearings in relation to etc but that this
entire domain that we inhabit of this intelligible reality that shelling calls existence um arises from
and sits atop this more foundational underlying ontological basis that shelling calls ground and that
this ground for the middle and late period shelling is not a you know calm organized lawful rule
governed um uh uh you know stuck in reality it is instead this unruly conflict-ridden anarchic it's
kind of like this primordial chaos almost um and then for shelling what you know we take to be
instances of effective human freedom in our constituted reality of existence are for shelling returns of
the repressed ground it's as though the impersonal anonymous uh unruly basis of all being um returns in
this you know uh uh you know uh localized fashion in and through human subjects and that my own
subjectivity in terms of when i am free and in those instances in which i am i can be said to be
acting autonomously that what is happening is in and through me this ground is in a sense intruding
into the domain of existence it's a moment at which that underlying ontological unruliness breaks
through the congealed crust of existence and and makes itself felt again um and perturbs that field of
existence now from within um but of course you know in my view i don't you know there's it almost
seems a bit like shelling is cheating and i call this a donut model because although hegel is usually
seen as being guilty of of uh of privileging you know the idea of circularity or this you know this
notion of you know coming back to where you started uh uh etc that it's really with shelling that you get
this model where it's that all right ground gives rise to the various emergent levels and layers of
existence and then at the kind of highest level of emergence uh at the level of existence namely our
subjective autonomy that that you know highest point is just the return of the of the lowest you know uh
basis um so it's as though we in fact just go through you know a series of layers arranged in a
donut shape and then when we get to the highest emergent layer we've closed the circle and rejoined
you know the lowest point so you know the highest point of the emergent levels of existence is the
return of the ultimate underlying graph and so it's this you know layered circular you know donut shape
kind of that you get with shelling um you know whereas you know i argue with hegel if you look
especially at hegel's philosophy of nature and then his account of the emergence of human mindedness out
of nature in you know the volumes two and three of his encyclopedia um that you you know it's not that
for him you know the various aspects of what we associate with geist you know you know spirit mind
you know in in its various you know forms associated with our subjectivity that for hegel is not just you
know in a sense the resurgence of something you know from the most primitive you know metaphysical
basis of existence that then re-intrudes within a constituted field of natural and human reality
and it's you know in all of its particular features um that no that there's you know something
irreducibly distinct and new about human freedom rather than it being just in a sense tapping back into
what is oldest and most archaic and then zizek when he you know engages with quantum physics um
in a way that's influenced by shelling um it's no accident that you know zizek flirts with this idea
that in a way it that you know his idea of the auto you know the the negativity of autonomous
subjectivity is sometimes that this is in a way like with shelling but now an updated terminology
that this is a kind of return in in ordinary non-quantum reality of certain unruly aspects
of the quantum universe right that it's as though you have quantum physics as this shadowy schillingian
ground and then you have the classical universe we inhabit of course resulting from things like the
collapse of the wave function as like shelling's existence and that when human freedom comes into
play for zizek i think he's sometimes tempted to take this schillingian shortcut and to say that
well that's in a sense something like quantum indeterminacy etc um returning within the constituted
field of classical non-quantum reality um and it's to me one of the ironies is is that for someone who
also of course in part thanks to his fidelity to things like german idealism and dialectical materialism
for somebody who wants a non-reductive account of subjectivity um you know this seems to be a
remarkably reductive move just to say essentially that you know solving the problem of human-mindedness
or subjectivity um it's just simply a matter of you know we could really say that the ultimate the
smallest ultimate constituents of physical reality are you know the sense where we are to go looking for
for the basis of what we call subjectivity i mean that's you know of course you know a hard-nosed you
know physical reductionist or eliminativist i don't think ultimately we'd have too much of a problem with
that um but efforts to do this i mean like you go back to something like roger penrose's work like the
emperor's new mind um you know the best of my knowledge nobody has really gotten very far actually
trying to flesh out okay if you're going to assert that there's some type of direct connection between
the quantum level and then our subjectivity or mindedness well there's it would seem you would
need to have the ability um to flesh that out at the level of the relevant sciences and as far as i know
nobody is even remotely close to being able to do that and so you know maybe in the long run you know
decades centuries down the road assuming we last that long as the species we'll get around to you
know we might be able to flesh out those details and vindicate something like the zizekian speculative
hypothesis that would have it that you know subjective freedom is a kind of of return within the field of
classical reality of certain aspects of quantum reality um you know that to me is something that
will require a very patient wait and see outlook and in the meantime you know this is why i also say
well look if you're going to spend time diving into the natural sciences in relation specifically to a
non-reductive yet still compatible with materialism or naturalism account of subjectivity there's plenty
of work to be done you know starting at the level of neurobiology which would seem to be the natural
scientific level closest to you know what we're concerned with when talking about mindedness
and to work those problems out um and again whether or not there's going to be any possibility of
vindicating a speculative hypothesis about a direct link between you know our subjectivity and quantum
mechanics i just think that um there's not much that we can do for the time being except wait and see
you know how much uh progress is made thanks to a huge amount of collective scientific labor in
different fields over the decades and you know further to you know and beyond that uh to see
whether or not that can end up getting substantiated in any way excellent professor um in fact i'm not
going to ask you because you've discussed this in many podcasts as to why you so prefer to stick to
the uh the cognitive neurosciences over you know quantum mechanics in the natural sciences uh i i
think i think people can find you commenting on that on on many other podcasts however if it's okay
professor if you could just outline uh some of the work you're doing um oh sorry before that perhaps
one thing i should mention is that um from what you said something i got was that i put it put it put it
succinctly for you uh subjectivity is still something new that emerges so you're a lot more
yeah that sense in your layer cake model whereas it's not something that where something that exists
in this primordial abyss that that returns to our classical reality um yes and and and i think i think
that that for me goes well with the idea of transcendental materialism too because there is that again
the irreducibility of the of the subject in in any way of what already existed and i think that's where
the uh interesting uh dialogue continues um all the interesting questions lie um unfortunately i couldn't
read your book with uh katherine malibu uh because it's too long to arrive so but i i do want to ask you
why you so prefer to stick to the uh the cognitive neurosciences uh over quantum mechanics and perhaps
while answering that if you could just comment on the work you've been doing with uh katherine
malibu uh within that field yes so i should and in in terms that i think also will be helpful for
you know again especially listeners of yours who have more of an analytic background um you could say
that my ultimately my reasons for preferring neurobiology over quantum mechanics in terms of this
uh you know longer running debate with zizek you know this disagreement between the two of us
part of it has to do with my commitment to um a very strong form of emergentism um and you know given
strong emergentism that uh you know there is going to be something new with each you know if we're going
to identify something as it is genuinely constituting an emergent level or layer a set of phenomena you
know that can be you know seen as generated by something but that level below that gives rise to
what emerges nonetheless you know starting from that level one cannot come up with uh a satisfactory
account of the structures and dynamics and play at the next level that has arisen on that basis
um that you know for me the kinds of structures and dynamics that emerge at the level of what we
would call subjectivity have a distinctness even you know that where you can't account for all of it
even in terms of just uh neuroscience that of course you know one of the things uh and this is
and this is where the link to malibu comes into play is that not only am i committed to a strong
emergentism that along with it would also allow for what is known as top-down causation but in addition
we have to to me malibu's big breakthrough here more than anything else um goes back to you'll find
her already pointing to this in the closing paragraphs of her 1996 dissertation on hegel that
you know she wrote under derrida's direction but really first comes fully into play in her 2004 book it
appeared in french at least in 2004 what should we do with our brain and i think malibu to her great
credit um is really the first at least continental philosopher that i know of who registered the
significance of the development of notions having to do with neuroplasticity and epigenetics in the
life sciences and those things really start you know coming to the fore in the 1990s um and that
what malibu recognized um and recognized i think in part thanks to her work on hegel and along with
that also on certain post-hegelian developments like dialectical materialism is that malibu realized
that well if the human central nervous system is very plastic and is subject to a lot of environmental
contextual mediation at the level of epigenetics etc um that you know one of the consequences of this
is that you know when we look at the brain it's not as though the brain by itself as a sim as simply as
a biological entity and where all of the relevant explanations for why it is the way it is would
somehow be developed at the biological level or you know at the chemical or even physical level
know that you know given given neuroplasticity and epigenetics that the very shape structure
functioning etc of the central nervous system is is what it is thanks to the more than biological
including things like social political economic etc factors that sculpt our very biological being
from the get-go and that the constitution of our bodies and especially of the central nervous system
is itself the outcome of the interaction between the organism and the environment with plasticity
and epigenetics being the biological explanation of what aspects of organic constitution opens the
organism up to extra organic mediation that nonetheless has absolutely you know palpable concrete not
literally material consequences for the very configuration of in this case you know the brain of the central
nervous system um and you know of course in analytic philosophy this also links up with you know you do
have you know certain analytic philosophers of mind who are interested in the topic of what they call
extended mind um you know andy clark alvinoe etc and you know i think that here again there's this
opportunity for bridging between analytic and continental that if you take the kind of work someone like
malibu has done in connection with issues having to do with neuroplasticity and epigenetics and put this
into dialogue with what more analytically trained philosophers of mind working on extended mind have been doing
one will see you know a remarkable you know i think uh uh you know confluence of concerns that and that you
know really calls out for labor to be done in terms of working out and weaving these these these you know
two sorts of research programs together and so yeah i think that um you know there's even neurobiological
vindication of something like the extended mind model um and of course lurking in the background behind
something like the extended mind model of of analytic philosophy of mind you have many various
precursors of that including ones that i think you would find in hegel um even though of course most
analytic philosophers wouldn't think there's much of any value to be found in hegel but there it is
um but yeah and for me like what what the first book of malibus that i read that um and it's you know
i i read it shortly before i had the opportunity to meet her was that book what should we do with our brain
and um you know it hit me that you know this this was really kind of a crucial what malibu was doing
there made possible a whole set of developments that you know some of which i've attempted to
work out myself but uh yeah yeah perfect i mean again you don't have to go too deeply into this because
you've discussed this in many other podcasts one one conversation that comes to mind is the conversation
you had with the cadet last on philosophy portal uh yeah as to why you so prefer to you know use the
the cognitive neurosciences over quantum mechanics and and i'd say one thing correct me if i'm wrong
here professor is that one thing you'd argue is that there's still a lot of productive philosophical
developments to be made just on the brain as such and what we're learning through the neurosciences
yes absolutely absolutely and again you know it's um you know with with zizek's recourse to quantum
physics i mean in the end perhaps there is you know some sort of detailed compelling account at some
point that could be worked out um to substantiate the idea that certain aspects of our subjectivity
uh you know indeed are made possible by what ultimately are quantum level structures and dynamics
but um you know that that does seem a long way off and that moreover for me that one of the ironies
too um with zizek is that um you know he you know in terms in terms of things associated with this
motif of ontological incompleteness you know etc that um what you actually would get
uh you know in terms of you know a fleshing out of some sort of direct connection between the
physics of the extremely small and you know mid-scale beings such as ourselves i mean if you could
carry out that sort of explanatory reduction of the quantum level of aspects of our mindedness
that would seem to point in a direction that zizek doesn't want to go in ontologically which would
be something much more like a kind of physicalist monism right that you know i mean or a standard
kind of reductionistic picture right that ultimately everything that exists is really just i mean here
you don't even have to have it predates quantum physics i mean you can go back to newton's era and
you can look at you know certain materialist philosophers who were enthused by newton's work and for
whom okay what this shows is that ultimately everything can be explained using um you know
the mechanical principles of motion in relation to the smallest constituent bits of matter so you just
have matter and mechanical motion um and everything ultimately can be explained in this way um and i
think that uh you know if you know the idea of reducing the mental to the quantum um it would seem to be much
much more uh uh compatible with a sort of radical monism of a physicalist sort which should just say
that yeah whatever our physics of the ultimate building blocks of reality are so the physics of
the extremely small whether it's quantum mechanic mechanic string theory whatever whatever we end up
deciding are the you know tiniest elementary constituents of physical being everything ultimately is
is is to be explained at that level and it seems so she's gesture weirdly is in line with that sort
of sensibility despite the fact that by contrast what he seems to want is you know a a an ontology that
certainly would not be an ontology of an ultimately homogeneous you know undifferentiated unified
field of matter in motion um where that's the sole ultimate reality it's just this flat expanse of
physical stuff and the efficient causal mechanisms for the interactions between those physical things
um but that's at the same time what it seems as though you know the kind of picture that would just
be further supported were his hypotheses about you know the you know essentially the quantum nature
of our mid-scale you know subjectivity or at least the aspects that interest him if that ends up being
substantiated then i think we're much closer to vindicating an ontology that is in a way weirdly
at odds with i think what zizek wants at that level yep i mean this is perhaps blasphemous for me to say but
it seems that you're more hegelian than even zizek
well yeah i mean part of my part of my complaint is that i'm like look if anything i think that slavoy you
are much more of a kind of crypto shelenian yes than a hegelian at least when it comes to these issues
right and that's you know and that's also you know why you know i do think there yeah there is
tension in terms of you know zizek saying that you know really ultimately when push comes to shove i'm
really more a hegelian than anything else even more than than a lacanian you know starting from around
the time you know that less than nothing came out in 2012. it really seemed as though he had decided
he was going to double down on you know that ultimately for him you know hegel was really the
most foundational figure um but you know at the same time you know you have uh you know in recent
years as i mentioned earlier today um him going back to this project that he first introduced in
1996 in the indivisible remainder this you know philosophical psychoanalytic engagement with quantum
physics um where it's very clear i mean it there and i think there are good reasons why when doing
that work zizek tends to favor shelling over hegel um and if this you know sort of dialectical materialism
that zizek claims results from you know his philosophical psychoanalytic appropriation of quantum
physics um if this is kind of the core of his system as he sometimes seems to to indicate nowadays
well then i think really it's shelling more than any other figure who is sort of the ultimate
underlying you know authority or reference for what zizek is doing where yes i mean i see myself
in this case is definitely uh much more hegelian i think for hegel no it's not as though you know
various forms of geist um are just the return of some sort of pre-subjective um you know say you know
nature philosophical or even logical uh uh x that then you know somehow manage of reality is having
developed these other natural and you know socio-historical dimensions um instead no that
there's that the you know for for you know hegel the structures and dynamics operative at the level of
geist although they arise from that tour um are really you know irreducible to it um that there's a
strong irreducibility there that would forbid you know the closing of the circle in the donut style
model that you get with something like uh you know the shelling whose philosophy of nature uh you know
then comes to be colored by some of his more spinosistic commitments and you know then you get this
middle period shelling that zizek relies on who was a clear champion of this return of the repressed you
know uh sort of circular donut model uh as distinct from the hegelian one where the end does not rejoin
the beginning in that way perfect all right this is a great segue professor because i want to kind of
discuss uh your other great work a new john idealism uh this book is kind of becoming like my bible i've
been reading very carefully um what what i firstly want well i think we already did uh touch on a lot of
these points uh kind of what you covered in this book this is beautiful line which i've uh annoyingly
read out to most of my most of my friends uh and and and and i can't get over the fact that for some
reason for me it captures what what german idealism is trying is struggling with let's say philosophically
it's in page 138 and if you don't mind i'm just gonna read it out here you say um the subject is the
immense absolute power of negativity the power of introducing a gap or cut into the given immediate
substantial unity the power of differentiating of abstracting of tearing apart and treating as
self-standing what in reality is part of an organic unity and for me this this is this sounds absolutely
hegelian this kind of almost the subject is almost like a trauma trauma in reality this appears
uh so professor if you could just perhaps give your thoughts on on that little excerpt i read and
as to why you think uh understanding the subject in this way is important uh for the ongoing
philosophical discourse around german idealism right so what one of the things that uh you know lurks in
the background of you know that passage you just read is something that you know here again since you
know that that book too involved a continuation of some of the debates i've already at that point
had been engaged in with zizek for a while but um you know zizek uh in in certain places very helpfully
draws readers attention to uh one of many differences between kant and hegel um and uh zizek uses uh
as an example here the two different ways that kant and hegel have of talking about this topic of the
imagination and german idealism um and without getting bogged down in the technical details for
german idealist scholars of you know exactly what is involved in terms of the notion of the imaginations
that features in this tradition um that of course for kant um one of the functions of what
kant designates as imagination is its responsibility for synthesizing for integrating um the contributions
of the two faculties of intuition and understanding and that you know for for kant the imagination
um is it does work in terms of blending together integrating making you know cooperate to generate
experience the perceptual contributions of intuition and the conceptual contributions of the understanding
and so you know this this uh you know you might say uh mental faculty power capacity of synthesis
um that somehow manages to hold together the perceptual and conceptual sides of experience in a single
coherent integrated whole that this is a cardinal feature of the kantian account of the imagination
um and so kant emphasizes synthesis there but then when you look at how hegel talks about the
imagination and you know here again i think zizek should be credited with really nicely bringing this
out um and the place that zizek references is hegel's um 1805 philosophy of spirit where hegel first
talks about this this notion of the night you know the night of the world and the association of
minded subjectivity with this with this nocturnal abyss but um you know when hegel describes you know when
you look into the eyes of another and you see in the black of their pupils this window onto this abyss of
unknowable otherness um and then hegel talked you know he he uses this very gory language and he's like
you know there you know shoots uh you know a severed limb you know they're cut off head you know here like
these member of disjecta you get a sense of you know in some of another um that there's this abyss in
which you know the world is torn apart and you know things don't hang together in the way that you're
used to etc um that you know for for hegel you know an aspect of the imagination contra cons emphasis
on synthesis is precisely doing violence to the given right reality is given to us in certain ways but
through our various cognitive capacities to engage in forms of abstraction conceptualization categorization
etc that what the what you know the human mind does is actually a kind of violence to reality where it
carves it up uh into these you know bits and pieces where it you know essentially butchers it
um into these separate components and you know then it you know manipulates them you know uh you know
re-synthesizes them in different forms sometimes monstrous ones uh etc this idea then of of of you know
something integral to you might say human experience writ large for hegel is precisely the opposite of this
emphasis on on you know synthesis organization the holding together and rendering coherent
of things and kind um that very much part of what makes our experience what it is and that
enables us to get a grip on reality is precisely this capacity for dissociating for carving up for
breaking apart for separating for you know cut you know basically cutting into with our abstract
concepts and categories and that violent dismemberment of reality is for hegel an absolutely essential
moment that we always have to pass through even if we're not aware of doing so that enables us to
nonetheless you know have some sort of an intelligible grip or handle on things um and you know so
there's there there there's you know this this contrast there between the two of them and that you
know is part of what you know was lurking in the background there of those lines that you read aloud right
this description of the abstract you know conceptual violence done to reality by the human mind is a
cardinal feature of you know hegel's account of things and that for hegel i mean oftentimes what we
think is that you know there's a very crude textbook misreading of him that hegel has his own version of
the distinction between understanding and reason right kant has his you know hegel takes the language from
Kant but but reworks it in certain ways and that you know we often think that oh well the understanding
a la hegel is this um you know black and white dualistic dichotomizing style of cognition
um that seeks to impose you know these rigid black and white distinctions upon a reality that is of course
much more subtle and sophisticated than these simplistic schemas and that when we move from
understanding to reason in hegel reason is where yes we dispense with the the crude simplicity of
the black and white dichotomies and divisions of the understanding and all of that um is is jettisoned
in favor of somehow registering all of the subtle shades of of a multi-hued reality and all of its richness
et cetera um and that we really just want to move to reason and in so doing just leave the understanding
behind no for hegel is that without first doing violence to reality without first um imposing upon
it these artificially clear-cut black and white distinctions and divisions that if we don't do that
it's not as though we can just simply bypass that and directly commune with reality and all of its
vibrancy and multifacetedness no it's that um were we to you know not avail ourselves or were we to try
and avoid that violent dismembering of reality through the abstractions of the understanding
instead of having reality in all of its fullness we would be empty-handed right we would just have
nothing that the only way to get to you know a richer reality is by passing through its deliberate
impoverishment in terms of how we categorize and conceptualize it and that only after passing
through that and problematizing our categorizations and conceptualizations of it will we get closer to
it but if we don't pass through that dismembering violence of the understanding we're not going to
get it to work yeah perfect perfect i mean i'd say again more for the analytic types here's where
i'd say you're you're a card carrying bona fide hegelian because it seems a subject never fits
into the order of things whereas whereas a lot of these the analytic philosophy they try to bring
the subject into the order of things and fit it in whereas hegel's point is i know the subject that's
violence reality um and i should probably also mention just for the for the listener uh just uh
between verneft and verse 10 this this book you beautifully uh outline the differences and you
kind of demarcate how it it differs to hegel uh over kant uh sorry were you going to say something
professor or oh i was also going to say with that idea of not fitting into reality the lacanian
idea of the subject too as you know what forever finds itself out of joint with or experiences
itself as alienated vis-a-vis reality right and that part of what makes me a subject is precisely that
i never actually can fully identify with or collapse myself into any of my you know determined
identity categories in terms of what i am as an organism as a social being as a member of a
particular you know institution or group etc that any positive identification and of course we inevitably
have many of them that nonetheless what my subjectivity is is in part for a lacanian that
part of me that never feels at ease in any of those that uh you know is is that restless sense of of
at least minimal alienation vis-a-vis any of those positive identities that i nonetheless also do identify
with at the same time but i'm sorry for interrupting i just no no no perfect that that was an excellent
point in fact professor can i ask have you been this is not not a deeply theoretical text but todd mcgovern's
embracing alienation have you been have you have you read this reason i haven't had a chance to read
it yet i've obtained it but i haven't read it he makes uh in this book that uh for the lacanian subject
in some sense the purpose of uh analysis is to create hysterics of us all and for us to not not to fully
to force us into the whatever the the social structure or culture but rather to kind of embrace
this alienation we all feel as subjects and and i think that's yes very up to point and i think that's
where a lacan differs more from let's say the ego psych driven kind of therapy where it's rather
getting you to fit back into society uh yes it's something very imaginary in that way of thinking
and also i think just in terms of certain cultural and political issues um you know what todd is doing
there uh you know involves this important insight which is that if we are going to have some form of
especially political universalism you know some sort of idea of you know a a shared common struggle
that really does cut across all of our identitarian differences well of course you know older more
traditional forms of universalism say like enlightenment style universalism of course we've
come to realize was just disguised european ethnocentrism it was you know taking you know a
particular positive model of human nature that uh you know that you know these partisans of this
enlightenment model mistook for the universal you know in the flesh um and falsely generalizing it to
all of humanity but it seems as though we're often left with the idea that well if you want universalism you
would have to have something like that and that would just involve um a false generalization of
what is always a socio-historically culturally etc local you know particular vision of of you know who we
are and you know falsely generalizing it it's either that or oh you just get you just say well it's a
relativistic free for all there is no possibility of true political universalism you know different cultures
different groups etc you know have these irreducible differences that just simply have to be respected
and that's it and i think that this lacanian approach allows for the idea that well you can have
the possibility of of a political universality but not based on some falsely generalized positive content
but based on what we universally share is our inability to fully identify with for instance our own
groups etc that we all are minimally out of joint with our context and various versions of that out
of jointedness are something that we do share and that if that is the universal it doesn't bring with
it the same kind of problems of you know cultural imposition ethnocentrism etc that a traditional kind of
let's find a positive identity or a vision of human nature that can be universalized no i mean instead it's our
inability to ever feel fully at ease with you know the second skins of our various uh positive identities
that's the level on which perhaps true solidarity could be established and i think that you know that
and so yeah i'm looking forward to todd's newest book um but he writes quite a bit too so it's hard to
always keep up always the uh the direct yourself and tom mcgovern i don't know how you guys do it
it's uh it's the constantly putting books out there i can't i mean us readers we can't even keep up but
you guys are writing so much uh and and just on that point i'd say that's a very anti-heideggerian
point even and tom mcgovern he points that out in the book where you know highly this whole point is
kind of getting back to the home the dwelling and various the the the more emancipatory point is to
embrace one's universal alienation in some sense um that's beautiful yes professor i want to be
cognizant of your time so just uh perhaps the penultimate question is it okay if you pick up
about 10 more minutes yes that should be perfect thank you so much um sure i i just you know again
that we could probably have a whole podcast on this topic but just if you could maybe superficially
comment on uh graham harman's uh object or object ontology uh the reason being i i really want to
you know focus on your the materialism you put put put forward um and just generally what are you
or what are your intimations on triple o and and that sort of thinking well i haven't in recent
years been keeping up with what has been going on you know in terms of object-oriented ontology but um
you know one thing that in recent years did occur to me based on past exchanges i've had directly with
harman himself um you know but also of course reading certain things that he and you know some of his
fellow travelers have published although again my i would say my knowledge of their work at this
point is a good few years out of date um i'm you know when harman for instance cautions against
what he called you know undermining and over mining right and the idea of you know reduction in either
direction of uh you know and insisting that you know there are these you know each of these ontological
levels or layers has its own irreducible specificity and integrity um and that uh you know attempts to
you know collapse everything down to the extremely small or to you know account for things that would
appeal to higher order entities or categories um that you know that that sort of um anti-reductionist
sensibility that is part of harman's outlook i share with him but i still think that there is something
interesting to the idea of subjectivity that cannot be accounted for using any and all language
available to us in terms of the sorts of discourses that we have for talking about objects um and that
i think that um you know in terms of uh you know whether you think of it as as you know our capacity for
you know reflexivity or recursion in relation to our own cognitive contents um you know when you
you know when you examine the manner in which you know we we operate when we operate with what we
take to be our autonomy or our freedom um i think that you do see you know uh structures and dynamics
phenomena manifest at that level that i think are distinctive enough to make it such that it still to
me makes perfectly good sense to say well this this is indicative of something called subjectivity which
is um you know not universally present it isn't it doesn't just in here in any and all objects
whatsoever only very peculiar certain sorts of objects seem to give rise to you know what what we
associate with subjectivity um although subjectivity for various reasons can't be reduced to an object
like the brain that nonetheless is a crucial material condition of possibility for it um you know all of
that you know so i think that you know i just i don't see much to be gained by you know in the
general spirit of there's nothing exceptional or distinctive about human beings relative to the
rest of reality let's just say as a fundamental philosophical intuition i disagree with that i do
think that we are very strange and peculiar um and it's starting from that type of of very specific
sort of aristotelian wonder at the weirdness of human beings that i think my work develops whereas
i think harman's at this level his most fundamental intuition is that no there's nothing extraordinary
peculiar unique about us and let's stop privileging ourselves and just flatten things out and put
ourselves on the exact same level as you know all other sorts of things that we could identify here
as quote unquote objects um and so i think that's a very fundamental difference in terms of of just
basic philosophical intuition but then also i'd say methodologically i mean one of the things harman
complains about about my work is oh i just you know he in a way that i sometimes think is not entirely
fair i mean he's a friend but you know this i definitely disagree with he tends to think that i just
that i am some sort of natural scientific reductionist um you know it seems like he doesn't he can't see
the distinction between the sort of position i stake out and say if you want to talk in analytic terms
the unlimited materialism of paul and patricia churchland um you know and you know to me like there's a
world of deference between you know a naturalist materialism a lot of the church lens in terms of
limited materialism and anything along the lines of what i'm trying to do um and it seems as though
harman does have you know and it to me is no accident coming out of the kind of phenomenological
background that he comes out of including heidegger that there's a kind of anti-naturalistic science
phobia uh to you know the object-oriented ontology and whereas for me it's odd it's like well if you want
to talk about things as objects it seems as though we already have apart from philosophy a whole set
of discourses and explanatory frameworks for that and many of those we call the natural sciences
right why would i prefer an object-oriented ontologist account of an object as an object
why would i necessarily want to privilege that over say how physicists you know etc would describe it
um you know to me it's that the natural sciences provide us with an adequate discourse we're talking
about objects that also is much more epistemologically found and plausible versus what strikes me as kind
of armchair speculation about objects that then also has the added disadvantage of it seems to me
riding roughshod over what to from my philosophical vantage point is still of hard to entirely dispose of
distinction between subjectivity and objectivity but yeah yeah yeah i mean leaving aside the methodology
for me it was always again back to the the trauma of the subject and what i read this excerpt where you
know the the immense power of negativity that's what this kind of flat ontology of triple o just doesn't
capture i mean okay to be fair i only read two books by hammond but uh i think that that's perfectly
professor excellent uh well i i i gotta say this has been the one one of the biggest honors of my life
thank you so much for your time professor i i truly truly i'm grateful um if i could ask i know you said
sorry go ahead yeah i was just going to say i'm very grateful for you having me on it's been a
wonderful conversation these are fantastic questions so thank you very much thank you thank you professor
yeah i've learned so much from you and i hope to keep reading your work and hopefully uh uh you know
i can give you an update on how the book study goes uh we we do it online i could even if you want
send you a zoom recording and of how it went oh that'd be cool yeah i will also tell you that um
that book adventures and transcendental materialism the chapters in it on zizek are where that's the
starting point for the debates that he and i have had about quantum physics versus neurobiology and
that was sort of the opening salvo you know and then things kind of develop from there so but there's
of course beautiful thank you thank you i didn't know that that's that's a great insight um but just
on the note professor so what what are the projects uh i i know you said you're writing on this book
which reject this ongoing debate but what other projects are you working on what do you think are
the ongoing developments uh within the kind of the german idealist uh lacanian or psychoanalytic space
that you're a part of so in terms of what i'm working on at the moment um i have a book in production
with bloomsbury that i co-authored with a lacanian friend of mine lorenzo chiesa um and it's a book
entitled god is undead psychoanalysis for unbelievers and right it is it involves looking at both
agnosticism and atheism from freudian and lacanian psychoanalytic perspectives um and attempting to
develop versions of what we call unbelief uh you know with with real contemporary viability
um on the basis of how the two of us uh uh work with both freud and lacan but there the core bone
of contention between myself and lorenzo lorenzo wants to argue that lacan's atheism is qualified
by certain agnostic sensibilities you know various reservations or hesitations that lacan arguably has
that prevent him from just you know a full-blown assertion of atheism without you know any sort of
accompanying qualifications or caveats whereas essentially i want to argue that no con is
ultimately a very consequent convinced atheist um and in fact is not agnostically hesitant about that
in any way um and so lorenzo and i kind of fight that out with each other and that's coming out at
the end of this year uh bloomsbury is projecting a november or december release for that book but
that's already written it's now just dealing with copy editing and all of that uh part of the production
process um you know make my biggest task is to finish the third and final volume of my three
volume prolegomena yes and that that that volume is going to involve a lot of analytic philosophy and
a lot of scientific material and really um it will involve bringing to bear resources drawn from
emergentism work on epigenetics um you know uh discussions of top-down causation
the hard problem of consciousness all of that is going to be part of this project and so i've got
you know stacks of analytic philosophy and natural science literature that you know i need to be
making my way through to pull this off you know over the course of the next couple of years um and
you know in addition to that um i'm starting to toy with the idea partly this is due to some of the
the teaching i was doing recently um of writing a book on lacan that involves focusing on the classic
middle period lacan of the 1950s so lacan of the caesorian return to freud so really seminars one
through six and you know certain of the of the better known chapters of the accree from that same
period um and my idea is going back and looking at that lacan after what has been the past 30 plus
years of amongst lacanians um preoccupation mainly with the later lacan of the 60s and after
um and that you see this you know with various figures um and of course someone who was integral in
emphasizing the importance of shifting focus to the later lacan who supposedly prioritizes the real
and moves beyond his mid-1950s privileging that the symbolic under the influence of structuralism etc
um you know this story about like this turn that happens at the end of the 50s beginning of the 60s
with lacan um and that you get the late lacan looking at the middle period of lacan after this like
three decades of focus on the later lacan um and in ways that would involve undermining this kind of
periodization of his work that you know that so many have come to accept is just you know
as almost self-evident um and that you know people like miller badu but also you know bruce fink
zizek etc um there's been this long-standing consensus now on the superiority of the later lacan to
the middle period lacan and not only do i think that there's not such an abrupt break or discontinuity
i also think that there are very interesting aspects of that middle period lacan that have
not yet been done justice to because you know in the us that middle period stuff was some of the
first things that got translated into english and you had like in the 70s 80s etc people reading lacan
in english um you know really not having access to the later lacan reading the middle period lacan and
doing so in the climate in which he's viewed as just one of many of these like post-war you know
french structuralists or post-structuralists and it's kind of lumped together with derrida foucault etc
and so you get this sort of language and literature department version of the middle period lacan and
of course you know since language and literature folks are the ones doing this they latch on to his
emphasis on language uh ala you know the familiar cesarean references etc but there's you know between
that and then the later let's just shift attention to lacan who comes after that starting in seminar 7
that's left this middle period lacan i think left underexplored and i think misunderstood and i'm
toying with the idea further down the road of doing this you know sort of you know more scholarly
technical deep dive into you know that middle period lacan and showing that he is not so much the
straightforward cesarean structural linguistics person who he's often portrayed as being in that
time and that there's a lot that we have yet to realize is continuous with what he does in his later
work or perhaps even superior in terms of how he tackles certain problems in that middle period
and to sort of you know rediscover and and and you know compel people to revisit that earlier lacan
after all of this attention paid to his later work and so you know that would be further down the road
but i think that's something eventually i'll get around to doing amazing amazing thank you thank you
for that uh almost for pizza let's say yeah well to use a lacanian term you certainly seem to be making
good use of your lac and uh good use of it uh excellent well uh professor as i said thanks
again this has been truly an honor yeah it's really been great i look forward to it just send me the uh
the link when when you have the content up i look forward to look forward to seeing it and would you
mind if um i've been doing you know i'm doing a series of podcast interviews in fact two days from now i
am being interviewed by cadel last again um but about infinite greed um in terms of these recent
podcasts colombia has a web page for infinite greed and they like to link to the podcast would you be
okay with them putting a link to this up there on on that uh that would be fantastic i'll i'll edit it
up and i'll send it across uh but for sure i'll i'll i'll keep you updated on how it goes i i generally
also edit these side apart from just cutting out the awkward uh you know lagging and whatnot but just
making it a bit more listenable but uh hopefully hopefully it comes out well but uh it's been it's
truly been great i i learned so much thank you well thank you it's been great talking to you and i
look forward to uh you know to being in touch with you again for sure sure all right take care
