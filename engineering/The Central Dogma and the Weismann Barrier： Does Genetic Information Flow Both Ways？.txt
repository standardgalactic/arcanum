Hello this is Perry Marshall and I'm here with Dennis Noble and it's a real
privilege to have Dennis here. Dennis is one of the most eminent scientists in
the UK. He's on the Evolution 2.0 judging panel for the prize and he organized a
very very important meeting at the Royal Society in 2016 which was probably the
most revolutionary evolution meeting certainly in the last couple of decades
if not longer and I was there and I kind of felt like Forrest Gump you know
witnessing history when it was happening there and I wanted to get Dennis on the
line here because he's published a very interesting paper in physiology
science journal called Central Dogma or Central Debate and we'll probably talk
about that paper a little bit today but I wanted to introduce you to Dennis and
and have him share his thoughts with you and just just a little bit more about
Dennis. Dennis is known around the world as being the guy who figured out the
cardiac rhythm which made pacemakers possible and he he was the first human
to model a human organ on a computer which he did on punch cards at University
College London in the basement of a lab in 1960 so that's I well I just think it's
pretty interesting he's also a very active musician and he founded something
called voices from Oxford which is a video interview series at Oxford University
has a professor at Oxford for pretty much all of his career so very distinguished
scientist very important voice in the evolution in in in the new evolution that's
happening now and so Dennis welcome I'm glad to have you here today well thank you
very much Perry my ears are already ringing or my face is blushing whichever you want to
say but thanks for that introduction well what I so so I'm not very much not an
evolutionary biologist and you're not an evolutionary biologist either you're a
physiologist but but what I could observe as a entrepreneur as a consultant is that
almost all reformations of industries come from the outside Martin Luther was not a
Catholic priest and Bill Gates was not a mainframe computer guy and Larry and
Sergey who started Google were not search engine guys and and and and the guy who
started Federal Express was not a shipping industry guy and I mean you can go you can
go a long list of revolutions that have happened in various fields and and it's
almost always the outsiders who say hey wait a minute you know we're really missing
something here and you're a physiologist and for a very long time you have felt hey
guys we are missing some something here and and there are things here that you're
saying are true that cannot possibly be true because I know that I know that I know this
because I'm a physiologist and Dennis I would like you to just as however you wish to can
you take us inside the mind in the skin and you know the shoes of a physiologist and help us
understand well what is a physiologist maybe not everybody exactly knows and and just
kind of tell us how you you kind of stumbled into this it's not like you started out
with a plan but tell me tell me about that Dennis absolutely right very the way in which I got onto the
issue goes back to a period during the 1980s when we were working out the more complete details than
I could do in 1960 of how the heart's pacemaker works and we found something quite extraordinary
which is that it seems initially to be unnecessarily complicated in fact I remember people asking that
kind of question as I lectured on what we were finding one mechanism after another but the point made
was but you only need one of these then we did a very interesting experiment both in terms of using a
drug to do the actual experiment on the heart but also to run the computer model which was this
take one of those mechanisms out on a computer model you can do that easily you could do it with
a drug to knock out a particular mechanism we did that with a mechanism that was contributing 80% of the
functionality it made only a 15% difference to the frequency of the heart if you take it out
now to an engineer like you and to a physiologist because in a sense a physiologist is an engineer of
the body yeah physiologists like me that said the following first if you do gene knockouts you do not
necessarily get a good quantitative estimate of the function the difference between 15% and 80% is
well even for a biologist that's pretty big pretty bad in fact now the story doesn't end there because
actually the pacemaker of the heart is backed up as we would say in a number of ways not just two
so i then thought about that and i asked myself the question if you can't actually relate genes to
function by doing knockouts what are we doing now i'm not saying that knockouts never reveal function of
course you get spectacular uh cases where with rare genetic diseases a particular change will make a
disastrous consequence for the person but what do we find generally what have people found with all the
genome-wide association studies that are going on now there are so many genes involved exactly as in
the cardiac pacemaker that what is happening is that nature has created robustness so you have so many
mechanisms involved that you have to ask the question why are they involved they're there to make the
system robust to make it safe just as you have a double control system on an aircraft but then you move
further on you see you ask the question does that mean that the control networks lying if you like above
the genome are really dictating what the genome does and i think that's the right way around to think
about it but once you start going down that road you start questioning the very basis of all gene-centric
theories of evolution including notably notably of course including the the selfish gene itself well so
let me let me feed back to you what you said in engineer language right so so you know i have a digital
watch here you know it's it's analog hands but it's electronics inside it's got a quartz crystal and
the crystal vibrates right yeah and and and a little um circuit divides up the vibrations and and sets the
pulse of the watch and so the the second hand ticks each second second and and what i think you are saying
is that people initially said well i just figure the heart has a little quartz crystal so to
speak and then and then it gets subdivided and then the heart beats and and then oh my goodness it
turns out well there's another quartz crystal and there's another one and there's another one
and when i take out one of them i don't get an 80 change i only get a 15 change so they're actually
redundant okay but but then furthermore furthermore what you begin to suspect was that
there was a mutual almost circular relationship between the mechanisms and the genes that code for it
not a one way like it wasn't just gene to quartz crystal it was the but each affects the other
am i correct yes and moreover for quite a long time the network which is producing
the rhythm can function whether or not the genome is there wait wait a minute okay that's interesting
so you can take out the genome yes the genome is required only when the cell wants to make more
protein that's an absolutely crucial point this applies generally there are mechanisms in the body that
enable us to know or the body to know when it hasn't got enough calcium transporter protein or muscle
contracting protein and it goes and tells the genome to do so you see the direction of causality i think
we have got it usually the wrong way round it's actually the networks and the cell and the tissues and the
organs that tell the genome how much to make of each protein now that leads on to a very clear understanding
of why a liver cell heart cell a bone cell and so on are all very very different in terms of the
proteins that they contain but they use exactly the same genome what's telling the genome to make a bone
cell liver cell heart cell is the cell itself so the causality is that way around well this is what
you're describing is a complete total conceptual change from the way most people have been talking about
genes and evolution for a hundred years well certainly since weissman uh came up about 130 years ago
with the idea of his barrier that is there was no connection between the soma changes as the body
changes and the so-called germline that is the sperm and egg and so it really goes way way back and that
incidentally of course was the foundation of what's called the modern synthesis which is the standard
theory theory of evolution so challenging that and challenging in particular the misconception that
the central dogma of molecular biology which is that you go from genes to that is dna to rna to protein but
never the other way around challenging that is to challenge the very basis of the modern synthesis of
evolutionary biology so i think it is fundamental it's not just a minor change it's a major one
well when i began investigating evolution
i concluded yes evolution did happen but there's no way the normal explanation could possibly be correct
and i i came to that conclusion as an engineer because what they were telling me in biology i had never
encountered in engineering school and i most people following that line of reasoning would have just
become some flavor of creationist but i said no i think there's something more going on here and what
i found was no that actually the cells change the genes now can you give a couple of examples of where we
have clearly documented that the cell modifies the genome
and it's not just the genome building the cell because i think we have to be very clear about this
otherwise we can't move forward absolutely so well of course the the classic example of that is the immune system
you see we can resist an absolutely fantastic number of different invaders viruses bacteria and other
foreign bodies invading our body because we have the ability to make vastly more keys to fit the lock
imagine the invader is a bit like a lock and you've got to get a key to it to as it were neutralize it
now we can make many many more of those than could ever have been put into the genome as sequences
how do we do it the organism effectively has a feedback mechanism which operates when a foreign body
arrives which it has not met before and it says to the genome please mutate at a very high speed now
don't mutate everywhere that would be disastrous it does so in a pinpoint fashion it goes straight for
the variable bit of the protein that it has to make in order to fit that lock and then it creates
absolutely millions of different new keys it finds one that works and it says to those cells reproduce
the rest die so we already have an example of that mechanism moreover if you ask the question
what's happening to those bacteria that are now evolving very quickly to resist antibiotics they've got
the same mechanism we call it hyper mutation that is the cell effectively or a population of cells because
it's obviously not a single cell that does that it's a population of cells in the case of the bacteria
a tissue or organ of the body in the case that is the immune system in the case of our bodies
that says to the genome please do the following we now know as physiologists exactly how that can work
too because we can show the mechanisms by which an event right up at the surface of the cell can be
transmitted all the way down into the nucleus where the genome is and to target that in a specific way
in the case of the immune system to say please mutate this bit very rapidly in the case of the bacteria
doing the same thing to its genome knowing it's got to find as a population a solution to the challenge
of a new antibiotic and is it the case that that cell can now transmit the immunity to its progeny
yes exactly because that's why the in the case of the immune system that's precisely why the body tells
those cells to reproduce it tells the rest to die there's a specific process which we happen to call
apoptosis but that's just a nice greek word which means in effect kill yourself yeah right it's remarkable
and it's so effective because you see the as i said at the beginning of this part of our discussion
the total number of new challenging invaders that we could encounter is vastly greater than could ever
be encoded by our genome now the obvious question about that though is this could that be passed on to
subsequent generations the case of the immune system the answer is no each generation has to start off
with its immune system with the number of different locks and keys that it's already got and then as it
were learn again so in that case that is not passed on but many other things are passed on and what we've
discovered is that there are many particles in the sperm line and in the egg line which enable what we call
paternal and maternal effects to be transmitted down through the generations again as a physiologist
we all find this very straightforward i tell you perry in my field of physiology internationally i find
very little opposition to the ideas that i'm expressing everything i've told you uh in this little
discussion would be regarded by most physiologists as damned obvious what's the argument about right
right right but but it it it's met with hostility by evolutionary biologists well in a in a curious way
and i i still don't really understand this i mean i i've got here you see the issue of of the royal
society journal new trends in evolutionary biology now for many evolutionary biologists what you might call
standard evolutionary biologists that was like the red rag to a bull they didn't like it now i just looked
on the internet before our discussion i find new trends in cardiology it comes out every year
we in in physiology we discuss new trends all the time we welcome the new trends
so what is going on and i think what is going on is very interesting the problem i think is that so much
is at stake in relation to the arguments in evolution it's an area which is hotly disputed not just by
scientists but also by the general public as we well know of course particularly in the united states
so it's a very very hot area and big reputations are at stake i feel that what is going on is that
people are shifting the goalposts to avoid having to admit that some major assumptions in the original theory
as it was formulated to give us the modern synthesis have in fact been shown to be wrong
simply first one the fact that it is possible for what we call changes in the body during life to be
passed on to subsequent generations that's been now shown in many many different species including
the human point two could it be the case that what we now call the central dogma of molecular biology
which is the point i made earlier on the dna creates an rna that creates a protein and it's
only one way could that now be as it were the defense of weissman's barrier the original idea
that the germline was carrying something which was not influenced by the rest of the body the answer
is there's no way in which that can be the case just to be technical for a moment but i'll try and keep this
simple if i represented a molecule let's say a bit of dna as the size of my fist here i'm in oxford in
england the edge of the cell that contains that molecule that dna would be way up in scotland that's
about 800 miles away that's the difference of scale that we're dealing with now the weissman barrier is
about a cell the central dogma is about a molecule and there's no way in which those can be the same
now what i found can i just try to maybe clarify what you just said so so the central dogma in its
most simplest form says you have a strand of dna and it gets transcribed into a protein and proteins
don't turn back into strands of dna that's right that's the simplest version of what that says
it's a molecular coding mechanism yes and you agree with that that is true yes proteins don't get
turned back into dna however there's a whole there's a higher level architecture question which is
is dna edited or rearranged by the cell yes or no weissman said absolutely not it only goes one way
you start with the genes and you build an organism and what you started to discover in the 1980s and
what has now been become abundantly clear is genes are absolutely edited and changed by cells and in
some cases not just your skin or your heart or your liver cells genomes get changed but it can actually
go to the sperm and egg that that's right now let's be also just to clarify that in in case we've got
some good molecular biologists listening to this who would want to say hey wait a minute
wait a minute what do you mean by being changed a variety of ways are now known one of those of
course is the mechanism by which the genome that is those sequences in the dna can be marked we call
that epigenetic change there are other mechanisms too but i don't want to complicate this one will do
those marks can go down through the germline and that means that it's possible for changes that occur
during the organism's lifetime to be transmitted down through the germline so that's just one example of
the kind of process i'm referring to it's not that the cell has a sort of cell version of crisper this
new technology enables you to cut and paste dna which is being used to extraordinarily important
effects in modern biology but it is the case that the cell can through its experience include information
in what goes down through the germline that enables it to be the case that the dna code in itself is not
enough so you wrote a book called um biological relativity um and you wrote this paper that in the
physiology journal that you tease out these distinctions between the wiesman barrier the central dogma
um and and you've you've pointed out that from a system level point of view this is a complete
conceptual shift in how evolution works it's a radical like you can't this is as different as
it well it's as different as catholic and protestant or it says it's as different as newtonian
mechanics versus quantum mechanics exactly and you you you can't just say oh well you know that was
always there and we just didn't talk about it enough it's a complete reversal it is a reversal that's
right it is not just a minor uh modification uh now i think there's a way of explaining that to your
listeners and and and and and watchers if we transcribed on a keyboard what we're just saying
we would use a qwerty keyboard now the important thing to note is that it wouldn't matter if we used
a different keyboard the point i'm making is when i type my paper out on a keyboard whatever keyboard a qwerty
one a french one whatever it might be um it is not the case that the qwerty keyboard is responsible for
what is typed i am in a similar way the cell is responsible for interpreting the genome and that code
between the dna and the protein which is a very exciting discovery no question about that in biology
it's absolutely fundamental not challenging that at all but it no more determines life than the qwerty
keyboard would determine what i would write if i write down what we're just discussing well so now you're
introducing the idea of the cell as an agent yes of its own evolution and organisms as agents of their own
evolution precisely and of course that smacks of another forbidden word which is lamarck now yes
history too but don't just worry too much about that but it's another respect in which the agency is at
higher levels than the gene in fact i would go further and say dna on its own cannot have any agency
it is a passive molecule if i took the dna out of one of your cells and i put it in a petri dish
with as many nutrients as you like give it glucose give it goodness knows what to keep it happy
for 10 000 years it would do absolutely zilch so the agency has to be at a higher level and again i come back
to what engineers and physiologists readily understand the agency process lies in those interacting clever
networks not in a bunch of molecules it lies in what we would call the software and of course it needs a
hardware that's good enough for that software to be able to be implemented but clearly the intelligence
lies in the cleverness of those networks well so this so so let's talk about i think we've probably
explained the basic science adequately so tell me about the family dynamic the politics the profession
um you you wanted to organize this meeting at the royal society and you're a fellow of the royal
society and you're a very eminent scientist and you have some clout so what happened when you tried
to do that well first of all i i just wrote to the president of both it was actually both the royal society
and the british academy the british academy is the humanities and social sciences the royal society is
what we call the the hard sciences yeah i don't know whether that distinction actually i find the
humanity is pretty hard but that's another that's a whole nother conversation isn't it well i play music
you see as well um anyway the the fact is that what what i did was very simply to write to the president
of both of those societies and say that i thought that the implications of some of the new trends in
evolutionary biology were of much greater importance than just in biology it relates to economics you
know the equations that people use in economics they're the same equations the price equation and
things like that as are used in evolutionary biology it relates to economics for another reason too which is
that a lot of economic theory uh centers on things like selfishness and cooperation and what's the
balance between the two if you start to question some of the uh basis of uh for example selfish gene
theory then my goodness yes you have implications way outside uh the realm of biology so that's why i
wrote to both the president of the british academy and the president of the royal society they simply
responded saying sounds a good idea put it to our committee in each case the committee has passed it
no problem at all they got to the point of advertising the meeting which occurred uh towards the beginning
of 2016 and that was the point at which a large number of evolutionary biologists thought this didn't
sound a good good idea at all now i i think the intent there was clearly to stop the meeting or to get it transformed
in uh one way or another um probably they had not really thought through the care and carefulness with
which i had worked with four other collaborators in putting the meeting together with consultation
widely around the world to try to produce a good program moreover we tried to produce a balance program
because we actually invited several of the orthodox if you might want to call them that evolutionary
biologist to talk only one of our original invitees actually agreed initially we had to we had to
appeal to the royal society to try to convince more than one to come now what did they do at the meeting
itself what they said in effect was well we've known all this for a long time you produce the question of
can the organism be it a plant an or an animal or a human alter its genome barbara mclintock showed
that over 80 years ago working on indian corn and watching how the chromosomes changed
as the corn was challenged in its environment jumping genes as they were called and the ability of
cells therefore to signal to their genomes what i was discussing earlier on about bacteria
signaling to their genomes our immune system signaling to our genome to rearrange the genome that's been
known for a long time of course it has but the point is that it's fundamentally incompatible with the central
thesis which is there's just random variation in the genome followed by natural selection and that is all
that is necessary now i will say this perry there are many evolutionary biologists whom i respect that
have understood that there are major changes that have occurred many of them now while claiming to be
standard orthodox evolutionary biologists will say okay yes we accept the inheritance of acquired
characteristics well my goodness and fine if they do i don't have any quarrel with that obviously
but that was the key difference between darwin and weissman and weissman introduced his barrier
he says so in his 1883 lecture reproduced in a book published by the oxford university press at that time
translated from the german into english he says darwin included lamarck's idea my idea is that we can get
rid of it so it was an intention to get rid of that so if you change the goalposts as it were and you
redefine the theory to be something different from what it was originally i think it's much more honest to
say we changed and my goodness what is what is shameful about that nothing well you know if if i can if i can
just speak to that i i think there's a very subtle thing that is going on here which is um the old
evolutionary theory that weissman espoused was very very friendly and simpatico to a reductionist view of
the world you've got and to making it sound as though we have this all figured out figured out
yes when in fact really if you if you look at how evolution works the universe becomes much more
amazing than you ever conceived it to be before it shows that there's vast regions that we just have
no idea how this stuff works i i personally i don't know i'd love to know what you think my opinion
is we understand about five percent of how evolution actually works in detail i don't know
would you have a number that you would throw out like how much you think we i'm just curious well
the trouble is of course that evolution occurs normally over such a long time scale that any of our
experiments um have difficulty coping with that in any organisms other than the very tiniest of organisms
which of course is why much of the work that's done has been done on extremely simple organisms like
bacteria or the fruit fly and and so on um i wouldn't be able to put a percentage on but i think
we've got a long way to go i'd agree with that i think the difficulty is not so much identifying what
the mechanisms are in addition to the standard one of random variation in the genome and then
selection between the results of those random variations there are so many other mechanisms
that occur including incidentally one that i'm very keen on which is that the variation is not just the
cause of differences between different organisms in the progeny on which natural selection can then act
it is also something which is used by organisms to create novelty now come back to agency why have we got
agency i don't know whether that's the right way to put the question but if we have agency that's
extremely important because that is what enables us to be creative whether it is as scientists as
writers of literature as musicians or whatever it might be you can't have a beethoven without
there being the possibility of doing something completely new from what anybody else had done
previously and you don't have an einstein if you stick with the idea that there can be no novelty but
how do you get novelty you get novelty in exactly the same way in an analogous way that the immune system
gets the novelty it's got a new challenge it needs a new key to that new lock and it goes down into the
stochastic level of the molecular processes and asks for the wheel to be turned very rapidly and to produce
the answer and i think that's what organisms do generally there's the agency that is what partly
drives evolution so it's interesting to ask the question as you did you know what percentage do we
yet know i think you're right it's small but there's a huge amount that we're going to have to
look into in the future as we work out how the different mechanisms that could be involved have
interacted with each other that even includes the study of the icon of darwin's evolutionary theory
the birds and the tortoises in the galapagos islands the birds have been studied and the interesting
thing is that there are as many epigenetic changes that's those changes that have to do with changing
the genome with genome marks as there are genetic changes the people who've studied that simply come
to the conclusion that probably both processes the epigenetic and the genetic have occurred together and
the one naturally leads to changes in the other these processes therefore interact and we're very very far
from understanding all the details of how they interact and incidentally for young scientists
listening to this it's an area to get into you know the frontier of biology is here that's where it is
and the frontier lies not in making more discoveries at the molecular biological level though my goodness
we do need those i'm not against the molecular biological discoveries they've been fantastic it's largely
going to be at the level of understanding those networks of interactions that lie above the genome and
which give organisms agency and therefore the ability to choose and the implications of that for history
for literature for economics for i don't know you name name the area of human interest it's it's everywhere
well dennis you gave a talk in oxford to a bunch of students
and you raised the question of uh what if someone committed a murder and his defense attorney used
the selfish gene as a defense could you could you um elaborate because i don't want to i don't want
to steal your thunder could you tell me what you said you're too welcome to steal the thunder what i did
was to pretend to be as it were on the one hand a judge judging this and also to be uh the poor um
uh uh uh criminals the the what do we call the suspect yes that's right i i was also pretending
to be the poor poor suspect's lawyer so i was playing two parts in the talk and what i was saying
was you know your honor right in in here in england we call the judge your honor um you know my client
says he doesn't think he really did this murder he doesn't challenge the fact that he did it
in the sense that yes he he used the gun that killed the uh person who was murdered but it wasn't him
doing it because his nervous system was created by his genetic system which means that he wasn't
responsible now we both know of course that no court of law anywhere in the world would accept
that as a defense now the question is why actually there was a court in the united states that did
accept it for reducing the sentence it didn't oh dear reverse the sentence but it was used i found this
out after i gave this to him now there are two reasons why we would never accept that as a defense
the first is that society would fall apart if we did none of us are responsible for our actions you
know that is not the way to create a working society but the much more important point and the deep point
is that we are active agents we are responsible and there can be no way in which our genes or our nerves
made us do what we do now that gets into some very deep issues of biology and it's
overlap with philosophy but i think we can perhaps leave it there that was that was the speech i made
exactly well this gives you an idea of what's at stake because there's a whole bunch there's a whole um
posse of of scientists and public figures like sam harris or susan blackmore i think richard dawkins
who believe well richard dawkins said we are lumbering robots that's powered by our genes okay and i think
that is a very disempowering view it's kind it's contrary to the axioms of every society and every
civilization exactly and and and i would just say look um just because you can't explain agency
doesn't mean it doesn't exist and personally i i view organisms and uh and and animals and humans as
i i i i they're they're free to to a degree to make choices and and this is why evolution happens it's
because we live in a in a universe of free choices and and and and if we if we i think it's really
interesting to watch materialists try to carry this all the way to the extent i mean i i listened to an
interview with susan blackmore and jordan peterson and she was saying no i i don't really have choices
i'm just a product of my biology and he said he said to her he said um well if i tr if i were to treat
you that way you would really resent it well you know people want to be treated as though they have
choices well indeed but you know you can also demonstrate it in another very simple way and
in fact richard dawkins himself showed this he took a shakespearean quote it's from as you like it
and it's simply the phrase it's 28 letters long me thinks it is like a weasel now um he asked the
question very interesting question how long would a monkey or a typewriter take to produce that phrase
just that 28 letters by chance it's more than the holes the billions of years of the existence of the
universe now then he went and i think spoiled his argument because he started to produce programs that
would somehow get there much more quickly we don't need to go into the detail of that he was right with
the first thing that's what he should have stuck with which is that it's impossible now what evolutionary
standard evolutionary biologists would say well yes but it is possible if it's just incremental
but there's a major difficulty with that and i pointed this out in another article recently which
we called was the watchmaker blind um to deliberately raise that question
um the problem is simply this that if you think you could get there incrementally for example by
holding every letter that the monkey had got right and as it were making the keyboard stick at that point
of course you get there much more quickly in fact uh richard calculated it would take only about 40
generations of typing away uh to get there but who is providing the information that tells the system
that it's getting closer to the goal yes that's the problem now i think there is something that is
getting there and it's you and me and it's the other organisms we have as you say agency and they are
therefore capable for example of choosing their meats what does that do why do women look beautiful
to men and why do men look handsome to women it's because we chose them that way and we bred with them
that way and that's why they end up being as they are i mean it's so damn simple darwin knew this he
wrote a whole book on sexual selection these organisms that do the selecting my genes don't do that
selection my genes didn't love susan my wife i did amen like preach it brother yes well so when when
we introduce agency to evolution it completely i think changes and i agree and i think this is the
fault line um with the the standard story reductionists don't like agency because it's very difficult for
them what you have to then admit is that the causation comes from a high level that of course is
putting it simply the whole idea of biological relativity that causation can come from any level
within the organism and again engineers don't have any difficulty with that it isn't the it isn't your
mac or your pc that does everything you make them do it's you who types away on the qwerty keyboard and
whatever it might be to create the functionality and the great novelty that is in your computer and
so in a similar way it's not difficult to understand that it's the higher level of the organisms that will
determine what they do and that's what we're talking about that is agency and then this you bring up
computers which brings us right to the doorstep of the biggest question in ai which is agency right
right now algorithms are just algorithms i mean even siri and alexa are as dumb as a box of rocks you
only have to talk to five minutes to figure that out right yeah what would happen if they had agency
and so ai and evolution are they're converging together yes and i would make the following
prediction for it being possible which is that the ai people would have to reproduce what organisms do
when they harness stochasticity because what do we do again use the immune system as the model but then
you can you can transfer that to all aspects of organism and human behavior what it does just to
repeat is to go down to that stochastic molecular level and turn the wheel of chance to produce trillions
of possible solutions to in the case of the immune system how you produce a new antibody to to deal with
an invader what do we do when we've got a problem just thinking of human choice when we are dealing
with a difficult issue we say better sleep on that what i think is going on is that we're then plumbing
down into the stochastic level wherever that might be in neural discharge in cellular activity whatever it
might be and then we have some sort of a filter which is the rationality filter does it fit or not
it's a bit like the immune system asking is this key good to deal with this particular lock but it's the
same kind of thing and i think the ai people will have to put in that kind of very clever use of stochasticity
then i begin to believe that they might create intelligent forms which are silicon rather than
protein i i i agree so so here you are in oxford and you you did the royal society meeting you've
published you know is the blind maker watchmaker blind or does she have one eye which is a very
interesting paper right you're you're challenging the wiesman barrier and you know you've been reaching
out to colleagues um all around the world and in england so what's what's going on in these
conversations that you're having and and you're you're you're winning you're wanting to debate the
issues what what's going on yes very very willing indeed but i'll tell you what i think is is going on
within my own church if i might call it that the physiology the physiology is the biochemist the
the pathologists and the whole of the medical science community the great majority of what i'm
saying you know that they might say well dennis you're putting it in a funny way i'm not used to
that because that isn't what i read in my textbooks well that's true but they generally won't disagree
for what i'm saying so there's a whole swathe of biological and physical science and mathematical
scientists out there i go and lecture to congresses all over the world in the whole range of such
disciplines the only time when i find any degree of resistance to what i'm saying is when i have a
bunch of zoologists who've been taught the classical theory and then they will say well professor noble
what new discovery have you made in evolutionary biology which is a very nice challenge to be given
because i then go through the story that i went through with you i said well you know i looked at
the question of would a knockout tell you what the gene does and then i say you just think that through
once you've challenged whether there is a clear simple relationship between the genes and the organism's
function you're undoing the basis of saying that it's all down there in the genome and once you start
questioning that you find if you search enough you will question much else beside but that's the only
kind of community within which i find a serious resistance to what i'm saying but there is another
thing i want to add i've put out the challenge the debate with me it's not been replied to nobody has taken
the trouble from the standard evolutionary biologists to review the new book it's now out for nearly two
years in for example the new york review of books london review of books or wherever you want to put a
serious analysis what is going on is interesting it's as though there's a kind of silence out there
they've all as it were disappeared i don't know where they are
and it's serious because although i i can't name names i have been through the process of interacting
with an organization that wanted to arrange a debate with me four major neo-darwinists in turn turned
it down for a variety of reasons i don't really think they've got an answer you see if on the internet
as you'll find very easily by searching you have a simple misunderstanding like that the weissman barrier
which remember is about the germline cells is now embodied in the central dogma of molecular biology
which remember is something about coding at the molecular level if somebody can say that and think
that that justifies the original theory based on weissman and then on its modern interpretations
then they've got a big problem because there's absolutely no way in which the weissman barrier can
be embodied by the central dogma of molecular biology i'm not challenging the central dogma i think
it's absolutely correct as a coding mechanism but coming back to the point i made about the qwerty keyboard
that keyboard which is the cgat code which then gets typed away as it were by the molecular mechanisms
in the cell to produce this protein or or that protein no more determines life than the qwerty keyboard
determined what i wrote in my articles it's very simple actually there's nothing complex about the idea at all
so why people won't come out and debate it i really don't know well it it seems pretty clear to me
that when you when you realize that the cell and the organism
control the changes of dna and that it's not just random and it's not just selection
then a whole bunch of books a whole bunch of scientific papers and a whole bunch of careers
become obsolete overnight i mean to to just to just come right out and say it i mean
isn't that true dennis yes i think i think it is but it's a bit more insidious than that because of
course nobody's career is actually going to collapse i mean many of the evolutionary biologists are actually
doing damn good work you just interpret it within a theoretical structure that i think is faulty
but i mean they'll continue to do their epigenetics they'll continue to do their field work and and so
on that that's fine but i think the insidious thing is that it teaches through the standard teaching
process a theory which i think has got things upside down that's the problem and that's a mindset
it's it's not so much as it were are the facts of epigenetics different of course they're not
are the facts of genome reorganization in response to challenge any different um all the way from
barbara mclintock to modern studies on hypermutation of course they're not those those scientific facts
are still the same it's just the way in which you view it but why is that important we come back to
the other thing we were discussing earlier on it's important in economics it's important in ethics it's
important in uh legal processes it's important in almost every walk of life because once you've accepted
the determinist reductionist agenda you have a very different view of the nature of humanity that
is what is at stake it's the nature of humanity and of course of monkeys of cats of dogs of paramecium
and of viruses yes well i think it's it's very disempowering to say that i am a lumbering robot
controlled by my genes it is very empowering to say you are an individual with agency and choice and
furthermore you're eating choices you're exercising choices your moral choices all of these things
actually in some maybe small way they even affect your children and your grandchildren genetically so at
every crossroads in life you better make the right decision i think that's tremendously empowering
yes i i think absolutely right imagine a mother um with uh um a pregnant mother with the child as
it were slowly growing in the womb realizes that what she eats what else she does how much exercise
she takes and so on will all have an influence on the health of that child in the future and the health
of the child children of that child and so on there are beautiful studies of that we call these the
maternal effects in physiology nobody in the world of physiology even has even questions whether those
occur it's just that you don't it's not normally seen in the context of evolution but it should be
you're right it's empowering and i think that's another reason why i find in addition to the communities
that i spoke about the medical science communities the uh computer science communities and so on where
i lecture and get very little resistance there's another area and that is the humanities i talk a lot
with people in the humanities and people who are interested in evolution from a humanities perspective
they also don't seriously challenge uh the great majority of what i'm saying
i want to commend you for your work i i think it's very important that you're doing this um it as far
as i can tell you're you're the most credentialed scientist who is challenging the orthodox view and
you know look people have been challenging this view for a long time absolutely yes but what what seems to
be the case was nobody could really get away with uh an ad hominem attack on you or or say that you
didn't know what you were talking about or that you were a lousy scientist where other people they
they could get away with saying that but but they couldn't say that about you and so and so it's it seems
that if nothing else you've gotten them to quiet down quite a bit i think they've had to go quiet because
i don't think they know how to answer the basic argument i would put out a very simple challenge
anybody reading the little article it's only three pages long so you don't have to spend long reading
it which is um central dogma or central debate anybody reading that who thinks there's something
wrong in it i would love to debate with them there's the challenge fantastic well i'll well i'll just
personally invite richard dawkins jerry coin daniel dennett or anybody in that crowd um dennis would
be happy to debate uh with you folks and i i'm sure i'm sure dennis can arrange for for the debate to be
held in a perfectly um large venue with with crowds and cameras and everything and and you know and dennis
i know you i i know that if you're wrong about anything you'd be you'd welcome to be called out
on it so you can be corrected exactly if one's wrong you just change your mind you know some really
brilliant people change their minds jack eccles who got the nobel prize for his work on the nervous
system changed his mind critically about the role of synapses and you can go through a large number of
people who through the observations they made came to the conclusion they were wrong if i'm wrong i'd love
to be shown to be wrong that's the way science advances excellent well i'd like to encourage our
listeners and viewers to check out dennis's book dance to the tune of life biological relativity
um look at his lectures on youtube there's one on the evolution 2 site that's really wonderful um take
a look at at some of these papers we'll we'll include links to them and dennis thank you for being a
champion of of self-corrective science and you know and truth-telling and and thanks for organizing the
royal society meeting thanks for helping me the way that you helped me and uh and i hope uh everyone
will will will lend a listening ear great very great talking to you
