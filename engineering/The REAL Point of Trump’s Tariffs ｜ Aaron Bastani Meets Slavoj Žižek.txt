I have a problem with calling Trump a fascist because don't you agree this is leftist laziness
something new is emerging we all agree it's bad what is this the really bad thing that we know
is fascism so Trump has to be a fascist it's not as simple as that fascism is a precise term there
are obviously elements of fascism United States are moving towards a tough ideological and other
dictatorship I like to use the term liberal fascism what's Trump and Elon Musk's message all the time
it's precisely let's get rid of the state freedom of law and they end up making state de facto
stronger than ever we live in a moment of change confusion some say collapse the post cold war era
is probably coming to an end it's been a good run it's been about 35 years somebody on the left who
made their name during precisely that period is today's guest they have held the flame high
when it comes to being a communist in much the media when it wasn't particularly fashionable
and they themselves come from central Europe their first-hand knowledge and experience of living
under actually existing socialism so I think they're probably going to have really good instincts
ideas observations about the world we're now moving into one of multi-polarity the demise of the west
rising automation rising inequality political turbulence I can think of actually few people
who are better than today's guest to talk about where we are in the world in 2025 it's gonna be a
fabulous conversation Slavoj Zizek welcome to downstream thanks very much although I prefer upstream it sounds
reactionary already the place okay let's go happy birthday by the way thanks but why are you doing
this because a week ago I was 76 and to repeat my old joke do you know that
you know the vulgar expression I will not spell it out milf yeah yeah now I found this in a tv series that
in America there is an expression guild which means grandfather I would like to
do f so my point is that till you are 75 if you are stupid enough you can still dream that maybe for
some women in a guild after 75 you no longer exist as this so could you give me one good reason why I
should celebrate this so you don't think after you think it's 76 you're no longer an object of desire
for yeah women now we came to another point I think there is a big misunderstanding here which can
be clarified even through Marx you know the standard feminist line is women shouldn't be objectivized
I don't get it isn't the whole point of sexual desire that you are objectified we should learn
from Marx here slaves or servants they are not objectified they are precisely in Marxist sense pure
subject you just work I don't even notice you as a subject so something is deeply wrong here I know
what they mean by objectivation you reduce her to a just an object you sexually abuse manipulate but at
the same time being object is the whole point of sexual attraction and I would give you a proof I am
really maybe you know my line proud of this analysis you know in hardcore pornography I made a crucial
mistake I checked it up and you know even now one year after I'm getting all the time emails you know
guaranteed in three weeks five inches longer but my point is that I checked it up how pornography works
hardcore what is the standard rule it's that even if it is fictional it tells a story you know this basic
rule of cinema that the actor shouldn't look directly into the camera it can only if it's supposed to be
point of view shot okay this holds for hardcore heterosexual traditional the man is truly just an
instrument you usually don't even see his face usually they hire some tattooed trip trip sailor or whatever
the man just does it the woman has to look all the time into the camera and express her all the express her
satisfaction so this is a very interesting feature which I think it's even worse than objectivization you
get the most horrible thing fake enforced subjectivization because this tells us a lot I read a complex analysis
where they claim when you are male sovereignty speak you look hardcore sexual act you don't identify with
the guy who is doing it he is nobody an instrument you reduce yourself to your gaze observing women's
woman's enjoyment you want to be sure that she enjoys and that's her duty so this is a nice
example of how being an object is by far not the worst thing the much worse thing is enforced
subjectivization and this brings me even to sorry for my jumps to today's uh capitalism where you know in
the good old times of more alienated capitalism the idea is the worker is subjectivized you work in like
ford car assembling factory you just repeat the same mechanical gesture blah blah blah now with now with
precarious work and all those more creative smoke you have something much worse you are expected to get
creative engaged and so on but for a cause which is totally foreign to you you don't care about it so
i find this much more oppressive i once tried to ask you what forms of exploitation alienation whatever
you call it we have today and i would almost prefer to be how do you call it a chain worker a big factor
you just repeat some mechanical gestures why because it may be boring but it leaves your mind free you know
it's just this then next step is uh caring like healthcare old people because if you are a human
person not just a pig you are well aware that you have to enact fake some kind of sympathy
which is already more engaging it engages you more and the worst is so called creative work post where
you say every morning we meet we have a brainstorm for half an hour these forms are much worse because
they you know they even do not allow you a proper distance you have to fake at least your engagement
itself that's why as i improvised everywhere where i appeared here that's why i think precarious work and
also things like i wonder if you would agree like things like uber no are the ultimate form of new
you cannot even call it in old marxist sense exploitation because you know how uber uber
justifies itself they say sorry we are not capitalists we are just pure mediators you if
you are a driver you own your means of production usually and we just bring you together with potential
customers this is ingenious operation because on the one hand you are treated as if you the ideology
is there is no longer proper working class because we are all small capitalists even a poor guy who is
uber driver he owns his car he sells it it you behave like a small capitalist the second even more
ingenious thing is that your competition are other uber drivers not the company uber so it's ingenious
already at a formal level it precludes any form of solidarity no other uber drivers you compete with
them the isn't this this is i think maybe one of the ideological triumphs in the sense of in the sense of
a phrase that i often use how they they the anonymous system i don't buy this paranoia that there is some
secret circle which meets once a year somewhere between wall street and washington dc and decide but
this is how i think uh they they they prevent any any social mobilization because again instead of
uniting with other uber drivers you feel them as a competition it's very difficult to get any
hasn't that always been the case with the petty bourgeois they've always been i mean and you would
say that they're small capitalists these uber drivers it's a new kind of petty bourgeoisification
because they're operating underneath uber yeah but the petty bourgeois have always been a class which
is supremely difficult to organize or to politically understand yeah but would you agree or not that's
one side of the story i really hope you're enjoying this conversation i love talking to people like slavoj
about the most important issues facing the world right now let's be honest the mainstream media
doesn't really do that if they do it's for a five minute chunk on the bbc world service here at
novara media we do it every single day of the week more or less we do it every week here on downstream
let's be clear if you like our work and if you support our mission of creating a new media for
different politics you know what to do go to novara.com support the link is in the description below
help us build people-powered media nobody's gonna do it for us help clean up
the quality of conversation in britain and elsewhere like i say the link is in the description below
now you know in my old age i'm still a leftist communist i can exactly explain why
but i would say that at the same time isn't there a sad lesson my god this will sound horrible that
without without people who at least in the immediate reductionist vulgar sense are petit bourgeois you i don't
believe that the real poor non-educated working class whatever you call them can self-organize themselves
without mobilizing middle class you cannot do not even in big sense revolution you cannot do a real even
resistant movement look at the one case bolsheviks you know there is a typical detail which depresses me so
much in lenin you know where he was in switzerland and it's a wonderful theory you can cut all this out
if i talk too much you know that dada what's the name of the cafeteria in that on the other side of
the river in ciri in the popular department that is the dada cafe where dada was born yeah okay what
people don't know it's like 30 yards from there you go a little bit further and turn up the mountain left
there is the place where lenin lived and although it's not true but it's a wonderfully fake best
explanation that i have of where the name dadaism came you know that precisely when dada was doing
first spectacles not yet called dada lenin lived around the corner so the idea is that lenin was
one sitting in a cafeteria there and enjoyed the spectacle so much that he shouted in russian dada
which means yes yes you know it's a dream it's a dream but admit it it's a nice dream but what i
wanted what i wanted to say is that precisely when he was in ciri he lived in a small room with nadezhda
his wife with a guy who was definitely a middle class having some cheap hotel restaurant but basically
just subletting rooms and lenin wrote this is now one of the few times that i met a real working
class this guy was but the guy wasn't that he was pure middle class you know so that's why it's not that i
feel any nostalgia for middle class but people talk a lot about middle classes disappearing
yes but at the same time as you said with uber and so on with precarious workers and so on a new
let's call it well they are not workers in some sense they are middle class even if they are poor and
the class distinction runs among them even in a as our beloved president trump would have put it in
a shithole of a country like slovenia no you have successful artists organizers who do very well as
precarious workers but then you have people who are all the time literally on the edge of starvation but
again the ruling ideology presents to you precarious work it's wonderful ideology wonderful means with
me disgusting the most dangerous precarious work as a form of already moving beyond alienation like you
are not alienated in a permanent job you jump from one to the other job you are free to choose and so on
and so on and so on this no wonder that today this is the gap from traditional marxism you know that
at least in germany and a little bit trump is playing with this now there is among the workers whatever
remains of them or i don't use the term in any uh uh a patternizing way real working class there is
almost a nostalgia to be a good old-fashioned exploited proletarian in the relatively successful
welfare state capitalism it means yeah you are exploited they take capitalistic surplus value but
you have a minimal standard the job is more or less guaranteed retirement healthcare are often covered
so there is you don't have to worry at this level and another thing i know this because
not that i need to do this but i'm an absolute workaholic you know what's the basic characteristic
of my daily life and i think that here although i'm in no way poor i'm not bluffing that i understand
precarious workers you know what always attracted me with this uh nine to five or eight to four whatever
that it's a wonderful moment at four or five pm you can say okay i will forget about my job till tomorrow
morning you can disconnect if you are a precarious worker you cannot do this i'm not a precarious worker
but it's more with me some perverted protestant ethics where if i don't do a certain amount of work
and by work i mean reading writing i have really as an atheist a pathological feeling of guilt i didn't
justify my existence in the eyes of the god who doesn't exist but this as you know probably means nothing
today many of my ex-israeli friends are like this contradiction you know i don't believe in god but
i do believe that god gave us the west bank but what i watch what i want to say is that you know you
never it often happens to me that some stupid obligations i was tired blah blah i have to do some
homework in the morning my wife sleeps longer so i go to
the store clean some things but i have things to do then my wife awakens breakfast with her then i
clean the dishes then i get tired i'm old so that all of a sudden there is six seven
pm and i didn't do anything while my wife at that point said says okay now i want to enjoy and she's
mad at me because i said i'm sorry i did nothing to feel that i have a certain right to exist i need two
three hours at least two three hours at least of work that's the horror you see how this gets combined
in some sense i'm extremely happy in the again elementary meaning of not being alienated i'm
totally identified with my work and so on but that's because i have no free time okay i kept from
title five but you see what i mean there is never this happy feeling of ordinary proletarians you know
yes i'm exploded but sorry guys at 5 p.m i'm free i can forget about this you're never going to retire
then is that what you're saying it's already reality i am now a week ago or two as i said i was 76
and uh up i should have been retired already because i work now as a as an uh as a researcher
senior researcher at institute at part of department of philosophy it's the happiest marriage that i can
imagine because i am never there never is not a metaphor for once a month once a year i think
just to do some bureaucratic thing five six years ago i had to go there but i they need me because
we are all now part of this quantified bullshit you know a research project is measured by how many
publications abroad and so on so i give them this and the deal is that i don't do anything at the
department which also they like because i'm a stalinist with a human face which means i would intervene
strongly so according to the old law you were obliged to retire at 70 but they don't want me they asked
the ministry to allow me to stay because i keep my research project alive this is in slovenia yeah yeah
but you know what i like now you will ask me with your naive stupid british empiricism
so what is your big i like i run regulate the largest research project in philosophy in slovenia
you will ask me but what's this project about i don't know because i have a young assistant very
good friend great philosopher who does everything writes the project writes reports i give him the money
money out of my research project so that a wonderful thing that somebody like derrida with all this fake
repetition would have liked once by mistake i signed some report and it was rejected because the signature
looked suspicious because they were so used to but but it's madness it exists precisely through this
hatred hatred you know they don't like me there i don't like them but i give them what they need
to get more money so i'm extremely lucky and such an irony i love this it's an old story but it's
forgotten today you know one can precisely identify to whom i owe my moderately called international
success or whatever to the communist indian summer to the when i was doing my third degree finishing my
studies in early 70s it was the moment of the last how should i call it hardline communist indian summer
and i couldn't get a job then for four or five years i was unemployed then i got a job at a research
institute and even this job of mine is just that the research institute was then integrated to
philosophy department why was this wonderful because i was just expected to produce texts they didn't care
they even preferred that i am not there because of this freedom i can have now another half job but
where the salary is higher than my service job here in london at bergbek and what i'm saying is that you
know there is a wonderful short story i forgot by somerset mom his short stories were one of my sins
when i was very young i began reading english by somerset mom short stories it's an ordinary guy how you call
this in a church the guy who doesn't do the prayers the secondary guy who just rings the bell or whatever
this there is a title for it this nobody second guy then there is a new law that everybody employed by
our church had to write had to know to read and write they discovered that he doesn't know how to read
and write so he is fired he goes home nervous wants to buy a cigarette saw that on the big street there
is no traffic with cigarettes so he said why don't i open one and okay to cut a long story short in five
years he is pretty wealthy so he goes to a bank they ask him to sign some things he said i don't know how
to write and they told him ah but you know if you were to known to write you would probably even be a
billionaire much more and he says no i know exactly if i were to know how to write what would i have been
that poor lowest paid guy in the church it's simply something similar for me without that communist
oppression i will be some stupid local professor in slovenia it would have been a nightmare so literally
communist oppression saved me because it pushed me to move abroad first paris lacanians then through
ernesto laclau and other links england united states and so on it's all a direct result of of communist
oppression if you call it you mentioned somerset mom who's your what's your favorite novel who's your
favorite novelist of all time savoy this is such a shitty difficult question as for 20th century the
answer may surprise you it's three mega geniuses first of course let's move from the west to the east
first beckett samuel beckett but be careful beckett not joyce
i hate joyce sorry if you are irish but beckett is also irish i think joyce began well with his
dubliners then portrait of an artist as a young man so so still going those ulysses the bluff is here
with finnegan's wake i became a goebbels not the right wing goebbels like a nice book to be burned
incredible self-indulgement narcissism you know when he said i brought chinagan's wake to give 400
years of work to i say no thanks you know but beckett is another thing beckett is for me the true not
like somebody asked me what would be your greatest novel of the 20th century my immediate choice was
that the third one of his big trilogy linomable unnameable it's really you don't even know who
speaks it's basically literally in lacanian terms the object itself who somehow speaks it's not another
person so it's beckett then sorry i don't have any choice here ah i think that reading of beckett as a
tragic nonsense author absurd so it's totally wrong if there ever was an optimist author is beckett the
way i read he's overrated i don't like it too much waiting for godot where is this idea that
it's a desperate play no they are happy in enjoying godot will be coming but it's not here so we have
all the time to amuse ourselves and so on it's optimism the same with kafka my second name kafka
well my god he comes as close as i can imagine to absolute literature but kafka you know intelligent
marxists always know this when they ask after world war ii brecht the hardliner who is a truly marxist
novelist his instant answer was kafka and with kafka i did some readings i followed here my good friend
fred jameson first it's totally wrong to read his mega novels castle the trial as this desperate portrait
of bureaucracy no the bureaucracy that's what many people miss is an extremely obscene entity in kafka
you remember in the trial when joseph k after interrogation being interrogated by the court goes
during the day to the same room and looks at the books that the judges were reading it's all hardcore
pornography is indicated and you have all this so for kafka an ingenious insight bureaucracy is directly
sexualized as an obscene dirty self-sabotaging system so it's absolutely kafka now you will say
this is nonetheless a desperate view where is the optimist side ah my advice to all readers
focus on his there are much less but they are wonderful animal stories like you know josephine
the singing mice fred jameson suggested to me if you look closely the community of mice is
poor group in some kind of very poor miserable but nonetheless socialist communist society so it's a
short novel isn't this ingenious about the role of an artist in the first stages of very poor socialism
where things do not yet function his stories about dog and so on so there you find the progressive
unexpected aspect of kafka and very intelligent many intelligent readers notice this you know that josephine
the mouse the mouse was the last thing he wrote and he i'm terribly sorry no go on out i forgot to
he realized the narrator
i'm i forgot to mention some comments like you know that i can read the picture of a Morgenstreet
it's that people complained above and below his apartment that she was laughing so loudly
while writing it you know i don't like milan kundera too pretentious wise but he made
he wrote years ago one wonderful essay on kafka where he said you miss read kafka totally in the
west of this tragic outdoor absent god bureaucracy for us he says kafka is a comic author that how
this called metamorphosis where you awaken as some bug he said read this as a comical children's
story you go to sleep you awaken as a buck oh isn't it funny and so on that's the key to kafka
it's totally wrong to fall into this absent god if anything in kafka god comes too close you know
which is a wonderful crucial scene in his castle where joseph k all the time you have these hints at
the obscenity of the castle no that is not joseph k that is just k the how do you call it when you
measure the land he is employed to measuring that okay he enters a school room and ask the teacher
there a lady he has an affair with like how can he get to the castle and she said please not in front
of the children and so on you know immediately castles identified as an obscenity then once he
tries to phone to the castle and the only contact he gets is two old men talking absolute obscenities then
a beautiful detail he takes a walk up towards the castle and the more he comes close to it the more
he sees that what appeared from far away the uh beautiful big
palace is really uh uh just a bundle of hats all falling apart and so on and so on kafka is the true
genius then maybe my personally favorite i really ask people to read it it's it's uh it's lesser known
but now even by my russian friends he's rediscovered it is uh did you hear andrey platonov chevengur
foundation pete i think he's a unique figure he was very active bolshevik he even later went to the
countryside to help spread civilization there among some in southern soviet union some tribes but
he that's the paradox not in the usual social needs in dissident way he saw from the beginning
the dangerous nihilist dimension self-destructive dimension but still participating in it she is
almost my ideal figure you know it's miracle that he survived because in the late 20s
one of his manuscript ended on stalin's table and it's kept just stalin wrote total pig don't publish
this like something very but he is for me the most precious one because without engaging in this cheap
later humanist dissidents he saw the nihilist dimension in already early bolshevism because i think
the one i don't like for example and i was so nicely surprised when i saw that all my russian friends
they are now in trouble most of them emigrated agree with me if you want to learn about gulag
just don't touch solzhenitsyn he's a boring moralizer and so on you know varlam shalamov
colima tales it's written in the style of early hemingway very short sentences without big too many
predicates descriptions in just in this minimalist style he describes the daily horrors of
in kolima the greatest gulag and that's the real thing and all my russian friends agree with me
they say no one they say that solzhenitsyn most paradoxically too much influenced by soviet
reality you know his version of dissidence has as a background stalinism it's it's imminent negation well if
you look again for the pure like single malt whisk pure version of it it's varlam shalamov no so then i
have this would be the three great uh 20th century no then i have here and there not so much novels like
forget about goethe schiller schiller is the first fascist if you ask me i developed this in one of my
books he wrote chilleries usually identified with freedom he wrote the bell clock or what a poem which
was kind of a national treasure under nazism it's the most terrible part that i read you have a country
where everybody is at his her their place men going around adventures women stay at home then that's
his reading then something horrible happened women wanted more wanted more in public life and this is
how he interprets the french revolution it's the horror of women getting active then through
crashing revolution women are put back at their sight and all the people unite in building a big
bell for new cathedral and so on it's the best short poem it's not even so short on the genesis of
fascism so it's not those my favorite there is helmut von kleist marquise von oh and so on if i were to
you know when you ask which is the best beginning of a novel or story usually the usual candidate is
uh is uh what's that my god what's the dickens about the french revolution uh one's hell of two cities
yeah yeah you know that it was the time of blah blah no my preferred beginning just look at it is marquise
von oh of kleist he said that in a german newspaper a lady publishes an ad claiming uh i found myself
pregnant but i don't remember with whom could please the father report himself to this place and it's
done in this totally cold realistic way it's not a shock and so on not to mention he's apparently
totalitarian very militaristic place he is my hero up to a point brecht although let's not
mask it brecht was a very heavy uh totalitarian you know then it may my tastes are here very strange
you know paul claudel the french catholic right-wing but he wrote a play called le otage
hostage as a feminine a play around the time of french revolution which
is was even directly a model for the harshest brecht for the brecht of uh this learning place
leerstuke the most totalitarian so i claim that every intelligent progressive author had to learn from
catholic conservatives you know then of contemporary novels it may be a shock for you i don't like him
especially but i saw also a movie i openly admitted the source is the movie did you see the movie that
ishiguro i mentioned it yesterday come never let me go yeah you can uh casual ishiguro's never let me
go it's the best ambiguous dystopia that i've ever read because you know it's a group of people in the
special institution and they discovered that they are genetic clones raised so that when they are mature
enough their organs will be used one after the other and then when they come to the edge they they die
but it uh the what i really like it's ingenious it's that it's not there was a stupid movie with was it
evan mcgregor scarlett johansson i forgot the title it's the same story but done in this usually pseudo
leftist revolutionary way you know like they discovered it and they resist escape no here it is
they knew and they are even free to go out but it's very enigmatically written because it doesn't
get you don't get you don't get a good reason of why in a total resignation they accept this
fate it's maybe the most depressive novel that i've read then then but i must say that lately
i i more and more limit myself from time to time to a good spy novel i'm getting old my eyes
are getting weak so i simply don't know what i do this i will be ashamed to admit it when i find a
really good novel oh my god this week i look go to wikipedia because i don't trust myself i want to be
sure in advance that i know what it is about the story and that i read just selected parts but when i
have to write about a book people think that it's some postmodern joke that i'm kidding i am not
when i write about a novel i try not to read it because you know oscar wilde this is one of his best
sayings that when you are asked to review a book don't read the book because this may make your judgment
partial you know i do then if i am as it were convinced by my own own review what i wrote that
it may be good i go and read the novel and i'm often disappointed this is my worst hegelian side you
know theory about something is more than that something don't take too much of that something
because it may hurt your theoretical destroy your theoretical insight i no no no wait a minute i'm not
a complete idiot it's very if you read the novel after good theory then if it's a really good novel it's
wonderful how you can be pleasantly surprised i was wrong but this i was wrong is much better when
you notice the difference than directly going to going to to read the novel no but on the other hand
i'm a boring guy in the sense that my god it's no longer the world today for people like me like rock
music yes but i am the guy of the late 60s early 70s i think that in those 10 years everything that
happened really happened and we are now just echoing it i find here and there something interesting like
you know the german band rammstein there people are so stupid when they mistake them as neo-nazis are
they crazy i was in contact with them they are radical left one of their big hits is links links links
which means left left left so that's that's uh i'm here a conservative in modern music
i don't believe it all this post-modern stuff i'm so old-fashioned i think i believe in big classical
music and as a total self-conscious eurocentrist i think that classical music european by this i mean
from bach till schoenberg this is it this is let's admit it the only music which really has a universal
appeal you know where i discovered it when i was in china 15 years ago this was the golden time of
all pirate dvds gigantic stores it's incredible how large were the shelves they got with european
classical music and it was so cheap once i bought 10 versions of noce di figaro another 10 versions of don
giovanni of mozart let's face it i don't know how to and then the people can say no this is eurocentric
some crazy guy there tried to convince me what about ancient chinese opera i bought one after five
minutes it got too boring and so on and they admit it and in my old age i claim i'm sick and tired of this
eternal anti-eurocentrism everybody is today against europe latin america you're the colonialist trump
ultra hated you know trump is again and again saying that the true enemy of the united states is neither
china nor russia but europe putin of course everybody i think that precisely today when europe is obviously
losing it's a time to raise the question but what do all these guys trump putin hate in europe i think
it's precisely it's sorry for this old-fashioned expression emancipatory core which is worth fighting
for now i'm the first to admit that europe screwed it up in an in a breathtaking way you know like
i hope you'll agree here okay ukraine but sorry gaza is a nightmare how i mean i know in germany i was
almost blacklisted and how are you almost blacklisted ah i gave you can check it up i gave year and a
half ago not the last september but the previous one it was in all the german media i was a negative star
there for a couple of weeks because the the the guest honorable guest of the year was my country
and they asked me to participate in the opening big ritual to give a speech where was this frankfurt book
fair yeah yeah yeah yeah and okay it was 10 days after uh october 7th i gave a speech i tried to be so
cautious you know i quoted only jewish authors and so on but was a little bit critical twice i was
interrupted by a high political functionary who started to shout about me i was brutally attacked in all
the media but you know what made me and this is where we are today really depressive you know that's
my old maybe stalinist aspect you know who are maybe the most reasonable people today in israel
mossad and shin beth no wonder did you read the last news how netanyahu fired again
he did it before the last boss of i think mossad or she said because they didn't warn us about
september 7th no no no no it wasn't that it was because they wrote a memo claiming this is not the way
what we are doing we should the only way to resolve the situation is to allow some kind of political
subjectivity to palestinians even more than two-state solution like we must recognize them as people
who also belong here and so on that was the true reason before now in trying even to establish a
personal contact with them there is ami ayalon another ex boss of shin beth who is saying something
that even today if you say it in germany you will be blacklisted and that's my despair where are we
coming in western europe when secret police is saying something that you free intellectual publicly are not
allowed to say but i find this easy to explain in many countries i'm not saying israel is already
authoritarian country but it's in the trial caught in this wild zionist ideology i remember this from
the last decade of socialism never forget that gorbachev belonged to the yuri andropov camp to the kgb
line you know in socialism yes secret police did horrible thing but at the same time they knew the
truth they wrote reports to those in power about real state of things people feel dissatisfied here
there is a danger there and so on and so on so usually the impulse for reforms comes not from some
intellectual liberals but from secret police you know and i cannot but enjoy it was the same in my
country i know in mid 80s in slovenia it's easy to know because we are a small sheathole of a country
so for us general secretary of the party was not a guy who you see once a year in a limousine
no he was a guy who you could meet him on the street without a bodyguard you know and i knew how it was
when they were debating should we go full multi-party democracy or not secret police was for party
intellectuals were against and then the political why why because intellectuals were afraid for their
fate they were afraid that if there is more intellectual freedom they will simply disappear
from the scene they will no longer be taken seriously and this is also what happened while secret
police was simply very realist they saw the writing on the wall you know but my socialist experience in
the simple sense of living in the time of socialism was very amusing but tragically amusing for me because
you know there were big differences between different republics in ex-yugoslavia so the catch is that
slovenia was the most market oriented to like it for us the disintegration of yugoslavia was not an
economic catastrophe because already before 1990 70 80 percent of our trade
was with western europe we were practically already there but what shocked me at some point is this
pure almost delightful opportunism for example this is for me a unique moment you know in medjugorje croatia
no bosnia they discovered a statue of virgin mari which was doing what they are expected to do
moving moving the head tears and so on and the party was too hard line they didn't want to use
it to organize big tourism so italians did it yugoslavia lost a couple of billions of dollars
because it was mega then something happened in slovenia at a very nice location halfway between
ljubljana in the airport and some crossing a small statue of virgin mary also started to do things you
would expect to happen like some tears moving blah blah blah and party was delighted they announced it
we will build the hotel they had plans and then a tragedy happens the local priest said sorry priest
catholic sorry this is superstition this is not a true miracle so something typically just in slovenia
unique happened in the most orthodox party communist party weekly journal he was attacked for non-patriotic
behavior like wait a minute we need this as a miracle to develop tourism what are you bullshitting there
and so on you know this is what fascinated me all my points about ideology not being taken seriously
irony came from my experience there because slovenia building a small hit call of a country
i knew how ideology function like in the inner party circle if you took the ruling ideology self-management
socialism too seriously it was bad for your career i knew two friends because uh if you took it seriously
it was for them the first step towards dissidents then you will of course see this is not a reality and
so on and so on so isn't it nice that it was not just that you didn't have to take the ruling ideology
seriously you were not obliged it was more radical you had not to take it seriously through distance
this ideology reproduced itself you know and this is what fascinated me how state ideology reproduced
itself precisely by way of not taking itself seriously do you think do you think it's the same
in market capitalism in the west today uh yeah i think that uh it's a big enigma but i think there are
elements of this with somebody like donald trump it's not so much that he is simply cynical but
i think that simply lying or not taking yourself seriously
the self-irony self-irony vulgarities it's part of his public image it's something totally new and
i draw many conclusions from this the first one is that feminists but not just them will have to
fundamentally rethink their strategy as repeating my old points as already adorno wrote in late 30s
apropos hitler hitler hitler is not a paternal figure his polemics was against wilhelm reich
who accused nazism of being an offspring called male chauvinist oppression no hitler is not a paternal
figure also today whatever elon musk is sorry he is not a paternal figure as i improvised yesterday at some
round table i love this idea elon musk is for me a pure actualization of something that went wrong with
but nonetheless proceeded from 68 he is this cheap caricature realization of 68 sexual freedom you are
not fixed to one job you do this and that and so on so that's why that's the problem that's the problem
today these powers i am would you agree with this now i go to the end i said yesterday you know that
the new text that i'm finishing now uh probably title will be let's pray that trump will survive next
couple of years because if you ask me as a psychological person i'm more afraid of vance than of trump
trump trump trump is still human human in a dirty sense vulgarities bad jokes but this makes him
one of us while now it's a joke caricature but isn't something almost alien like strange in gd vance
i doubt if he's really human the cold way he's a robot creature made by peter thiel and
trained what to say and so on you know also people accuse me of being pro-trampian i'm not crazy but i
would say yanis varoufakis with whom i often disagree but often agree he told me gave a very good
explanation and now i saw some liberal and other economies to point this out everybody's saying now
it's ridiculous artificial these new tariffs and so on i think that they may fail but they are part of a
quite well planned strategy the effect of chaos now is a first step but as every good economist left or
right will explain to you what trump wants and not just trump is something apparently contradictory we
had after world war ii two big periods breton woods then with nixon 71 i think no longer gold standard out
of breton woods and varoufakis is here right the idea of neoliberalism was don't worry about debt
open yourself to mega imports from china from western europe because of the universal status of dollar and
because of this trust america protects us all the more you import you don't lose money large majority of
this money stays in the united states on wall street as investment and so on this formula is now with success
of china and so on coming to an end so trump don't take him as a ridiculous figure his plan is this one first
he wants something that may appear contradictory he wants to re-industrialize united states and the
strategy to do this is import tariffs and uh modest not too strong devaluation of dollar he doesn't want
dollar to be too strong because this will make imports but at the same time he made this clear at the same
time he wants dollar to remain the universal currency he even once exploded he said if i just hear that any
country wants to step out of dollarization it's worse than anything it will be immediately excluded and so
on and so on so it's apparently contradictory you want your currency with lower value
helping this helping this and so on but i think that it's not just chaos this chaos was intended as a
chaos he even said people didn't listen people now say is he crazy this is chaos he wanted chaos he had
pretty good advisors behind him he wanted chaos which now opens up a space for negotiations
this chaos this chaos tariff is just a pretext then to deal with different countries tariffs which again
should be then fixed at precisely this level that dollar would lose some value
industry will move back to united states but dollar will still remain the universal currency the least
i can say is that i'm too stupid to say will it succeed or not but it is a consistent strategy
he is not just a madman no i agree with that and there's also the point about if stocks look less
attractive people go into us treasuries the cost of us debt falls they can refinance us debt your debt
repayments are lower that's where he if i may use uh i totally agree with you a vulgar slovin saying
that's where uh uh trump not grabs the pussy or whatever trump holds by the balls and can squeeze them china
china would already long ago make de-dollarization they were trying with some virtual but you know what's
what's the problem of china in the neoliberal era they were doing exactly what was expected they were investing
so much of their profit into united states according to some estimates around 10 percent of what of all
to put it naively american wealth all material wealth is owned by china and another 10 percent by by saudi arabia
and you know it's problematic for these countries to simply de-dollarize themselves because through their
wealth they are rooted they are linked to the united states so i i uh what surprised me more
is how obvious the political biases are nonetheless in these tariffs i don't take seriously that
complaint that even some stupid arctic island where only penguins live are also now tariffs raised i even
think this is a good joke i'd what barrett's murder you notice one big name missing russia people usually
say because it's not important as a partner no first it's not so minimal second point obviously he wants
more exchange economic exchange with russia so that's the paradox ukraine got 10 percent russia
didn't get any new tariffs i know there already are tariffs so my point would have been it's very sad one
i'm not saying trump is a genius i'm just saying he is not just a confused guy economically it may not work
but don't dismiss him as a confused idiot you know all those who say oh he will ruin it maybe not and
he will ruin it especially i like to repeat this point it's crucial he's uh how he's very obscenity when
he's scot-like and so on works did you read a week or two after elections aoc she noticed something you know
this story i know this story i hope i do it's wonderful that many of people who voted for her locally
she kept her brooklyn district as a congresswoman on fed in federal elections they voted for trump
so she was intrigued why she wrote them don't ask me how she got their names it's better not to know
she wrote them like how could you do this and it's very interesting the answer she got that while
democrats were obviously well trained totally predictable you remember those ridiculous answer
at the end i remember kamala harris no she was asked what to do in the middle east and you know
she was so careful not to offend any side either israel or pale so she said something like people are
dying there we must stop it we must bring peace ahaha nothing you know while so the reaction of those
voters who said that you aoc and trump at least appear to authentically spontaneously say what they
mean and for them that's the madness that i like the very fact that trump is often caught either lying or
in inconsistencies works as an argument for trump they will say you see he is not well trained he is
human like us he and so on and so on so i think if you combine these two levels that is to say on the
one hand the uh the economic policy then now ah i have another surprise for you you know the usual
complaint against trump is he is i wonder if you would agree with me here that's a hard line that's
what i call i'm stalinist with a human face not socialist you know people complain trump runs it as a
dictator he simply more or less ignores congress whatever with decrease i think in today's ideological
confusion that's maybe in itself not a bad thing wasn't there a period you must have heard this argument
wasn't there a period of franklin delano roosevelt well sorry he was de facto doing the same you never
read about any debates with congress he was silently accepted as a de facto monarch and it worked so you
don't have a critique of strong man politics you say we need it today what we need it why would you
need it because uh it's something horrible that will say yes we need to try to awaken the people but
i will repeat now maybe you heard with my old slogan which is which betrays my pessimism uh
uh obviously liberal democracy our and not against democracy but i'm talking about our multi-party
system is getting more and more inefficient inefficient in the sense that the real issues are not debated
people are less and less interested in political debates and so on
uh so uh i and uh i think uh i and this is a worldwide phenomenon like what i wrote is
don't dismiss china too easily oh bad guys extremely interesting things are happening now in china
on the one hand maybe it's too much propaganda but you know all that deep seek stuff
and then some med some new new drugs medicines like something for i think women's breast cancer which
is much cheaper and more effective than the western and then of course electric cars cheaper better so
the paradox of china is that their type of authoritarian system which nonetheless allows market forces to play
but in controlled way but in controlled way it's even it's even more effect what do we
some of us i doubt still admiring capitalism this you know it can be all manipulated oligarchs but
from time to time you get under big quotation marks some creative capitalists local who does a wonder
in china there in china there is almost more space for that now they are even better capital capitalists
you know so uh uh uh i think that uh i think that the only solution i see for europe is to
try to try to test and we are now entering a world of it's my old joke if you heard it uh
orwell although i think his novel is wrong 1984 but you know what's the world for all orwell
oceania euro asia and east asia that's where we are today he was right oceania united states dominance
uh euro asia russia europe is a problem who will get it and east asia china europe i think the only way
to do is to reassert itself as a some kind of united superpower and searching for a link with china a
strategic link i have no illusions about china but one good thing about china is that it's far away
and also it's economically effective it has its own horrible dirty parts like i could tell you
stories about what china is doing in zambia and other african countries brutally exploiting destroying
nature and so on but i think the main problem the problem is can europe do it it would be nice too
but i am a pessimist i don't know where are you i think europe is already so disunited with parts
under trump's influence parts under putin's influence i think that europe cannot even unite itself but
back to europe so i think in this constellation i don't think we can afford this slow democratic
process of waiting for a good more open party to emerge we need it's horrible to say a master to awaken
us unfortunately trump did this as it were in a wrong way but again look at franklin delano
roosevelt do you know as you probably know that united states got out of economic crisis recession
basically only in the time of the world war ii and it worked triumphantly i read some statistic in order in
1945 if you take if you discount everything produced for the army
which was a gigantic budget and you take consumerist products they were higher than ever
consumerist not army products so i think that now i comes my very pessimist view in today's time of
ideology depoliticization of the young i almost care more for this i don't know how it is here but do
you know that in china crucial point they have now a vast movement called bailan i think it means
literally let it rot billions of the younger generation the idea is the society is too corrupted too
complex get a modest job ignore everything just try to enjoy at a small level everyday life and it's
interesting what the party's answer to this is not study mao but return to chinese tradition
confucianism and so on so what i'm saying that in this constellation it's horrible what i will say
you know lincoln's which was not lincoln's of course we know he took it from another everybody took what is
attributed to him from another you can cheat some people all the time all people some the time not all the
people all the time maybe you can cheat all the people all the time there are rare traumatic moments
when in a good sense not in a fascist sense because you should never forget that deutschland
germany awakened this was the nazi motto no but that where people authentically awaken but you need to be
kicked up your ass and crisis doesn't help the old leftist ideal was when a nation is in a crisis it's our
chance did you notice that in the last half a century i mean earlier no crisis brought extreme right to
power while left took over precisely when there was relative relative prosperity so i think
that there is no way to guarantee it but i think you can crucify me for this we need a leftist trump
by trump i don't mean the obscene clown and so on but somebody who will behave in a little bit more
dictatorial way okay there were attempts but he screwed it up i was from the beginning critical now you will say
of course hugo chavez no he was wrong from the very beginning i distrusted chavez you know who were
closer to it do you follow the situation there now they screwed it up it's over but under evo morales
bolivia it's one of the few from what i know genuine economic miracles under his first 12 years of rule
standard of so-called ordinary people went up but big capital remains there through coercion through not
being too harshly and so on so i think that uh you know i think we should drop where is your position here
would you agree if i say even my friends like varoufakis who knew it's not enough to indulge in this leftist
laziness i caught it you know how that's why i have a problem with calling trump a fascist
because don't you agree this is leftist laziness something new is emerging we all agree it's bad
that then instead of thinking you reason like this what is this the really bad thing that we know is
fascism so trump has to be a fascist it's not as simple as that fascism is a precise term there are
obviously elements of fascism united states are moving towards a tough ideological and other
dictatorships but it's still that's why i just for the time being just to signal the paradox i like to
use the term liberal fascism you know in the sense that you should never forget that trump is a living
proof how liberalism brought to extreme turns into authoritarian system because what's trump and elon
musk's message all the time it's precisely let's get rid of the state freedom of logo and they end up
making state de facto stronger than ever sorry you wanted to say something but then that's an
argument for them being fascist because if you look at the emergence of italian fascism for instance
you know the precursor to that is italian liberalism people like gialletti were saying yeah mussolini
great guy and i don't think trump's a fascist i think he's not those authoritarian nationalist i think
i think jd vance might be something different i don't know the guy but yeah but he's in power i would
say i agree with you we don't yet know but do you agree there is a potentially terrifying dimension
in events 100 100 although if trump went for a third term yeah that that change in constitutional
norms would that be something where you but aren't this and trump is specialist in this sorry to
interrupt you aren't these unwritten rules is it written or it's just a castle well fdr did it right
sorry fdr did it four times yeah and the big in the last elections already 1940 the big motto of
republicans was washington couldn't no washington didn't lincoln couldn't fdr shouldn't wow i didn't
know that yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know trump here maybe he has a chance so let's go on sorry it was
part of your argument no no no so i i i agree with that he's not necessarily a fascist no but it may be
even worse in the long term i agree with this because it will be but what fascinates me and here i also
have problems with uh with uh varoufakis idea neo-feudalism yeah i see element techno yeah
you know i see his point it's obvious and i even theorized it years ago the problem is that with guys
like elon musk bezos and so on they uh they repeat what marx called privatization of the commons but not
in the old sense where you have common land etc and you distribute it to private owners it's rather
that commons remain commons for example the commons of buying the books 60 of it even more in my branch
of books is controlled by amazon which then can blackmail both sides amazon is doing this serially
if they don't like an author they cheat you know you search for the book they have hundreds of books
they claim out of stock or whatever so uh yes but you know what's different feudalism is for me too much
identified with this hierarchic order where everybody is at his her their place you know a surf is a surf
you are there an artisan is an artisan organized in guilds it's a very well hierarchically ordered
system where you are aware of your place i don't find this in trumpian economy well john gray who i
spoke to about precisely this said the exact same thing he said he would he thinks it's a qualitatively
better society to live in feudalism than what we're moving into i will say this although you know i try
to ignore him because a couple of years ago yeah he wrote i was really mad at him an attack on me
literally claiming that i am laying foundation for a new holocaust you know really yeah where was this
if you want i can send you the link my statesman or do you remember somewhere there yeah i'm not sure if
it's new statement somewhere in israel or where no in in you here in your beautiful a holocaust here
no no no that i am with my critique of israel right some remark that i am laying the ground for a new
absurd holocaust which is absurd because at the same time that i'm attacked from hardline zionists
whatever we call them i'm here always cautious because i know many things about the origins of zionism
you know that in the beginning it wasn't just this fascist zionist through the arabs out it was a very
interesting vision of how we could incorporate ourselves around palestinians living harmoniously
with them it was this vision of kibbutz agricultural zionism so even here i'm i'm very careful this also was
my i mean i wrote many many pro palestinian things i'm doing it all the time but at the same time you
know i had debates i obeyed the rules of bds but at the same time i say sometimes it's not enough to say
yeah boycott israel not the jews because in many parts of europe
antisemitism is de facto still alive and it's even worse the old antisemites are now making a pact with
zionists did you notice this is for me at a universal historical event two weeks ago there was a big
conference in jerusalem organized by netanyahu's right-wingers even many jewish members of parliament
some of them boycotted it big conference on how to fight antisemitism today and you know who were there
how's he called jordan bordello or what quite an appartella yeah bardella quite an appropriate name
brother and so on the second man after marine le pen my god marine le pen her father was openly
a holocaust denier so we have this strange pact between old style universe european anti-semites and
israel zionists now and you must have read it i'm really proud of this they were so mad at me
some israelis when i brought out these documents for example do you know my quote i can send it to you
in 1936 the guy himself who reinhard hydrich that one all of them wrote a text where he says there are
two types of jews assimilationists and those who want to return to palestine and say we don't want the
first ones but we fully support the second ones if jews move there we are they are creative people we
can have a wonderful collaboration with them it's the same i often quote him maybe you know my quote
bravig that norwegian madman he also said here jews are a danger in israel we should fully support them
and so on this there is something so weird going on here how the cards get the cards get get mixed so
again that was my problem with john gray but more and more i discovered that that maybe we are often
moving in the same direction because he also takes seriously the crisis of liberal democracy now no
he doesn't bullshit here no he is out of this mega mistake of biden administration as i develop often
they thought that trump was simply a mistake something happened let's correct it you know no
there was a deeper necessity in trump that's why do you agree with this my ideal is the greatest symbol
in united states recently is you remember of course you do biden's inauguration who stole the show
bernie sanders sitting there alone with his gloves woolen or whatever i this gave me some hope that this
isn't this fascination with sanders a kind of awareness that the biden spectacle there was something
deeply false in it that they didn't really confront the problem you know so again uh uh in this
sense and i don't have an easy answer don't know you know people always tell me and they are right
okay tell us precisely what to do i'm not bluffing i'm too old and tired to bluff i just discount back
to varoufakis so my first point is yes in precise sense that you said it's better feudalism you know
this aspect is totally missing in trumpian approach where okay a couple of oligarchs control society but
society in itself is in a total uh totally chaotic state so it doesn't work this neo-feudalism is
problematic fascism who knows is problem it's problematic and so on i think we are really in a
period of what my good friend fred jameson called lack of cognitive mapping it's more than just uh you
know you the usual complaint of the left is we know the global situation what is going on but we cannot
mobilize people and then for false reasons many stupid leftists discover psychoanalysis the reasoning
is well according to the marxist dogma working class should arise they don't so it must be ideological
manipulation of unconscious motive bring psychoanalysis no no i'm totally against this use of pseudo use of
psychoanalysis there really is a lack of vision and i i i don't have i my idea is here what i called in one
of my text principled opportunism or pragmatism i don't mean by this do anything i mean when the
circumstances are changing we must retain our principles emancipation and so on but the situation
has changed so radically that precisely to remain faithful to our principle position we have to change
many detailed analysis for example what i mentioned before feminism no sorry patriarchal order is no longer
the big threat women are still subordinated and so on i take it all but
but again
i mean uh uh it's a new form of authority which is openly obscene and so on the story that you must
know i always repeat it that's why you remember six of january when was it uh five years ago or whatever
no when trump lost my friends were crying there you know no because they cried when they saw
crowd of people occupying congress they said but this is what we should be doing people gather occupy now
the trumpians even took from us the revolution you know yes they did is my point yes they did so many
what i would advise the left to drop is this fascination with provocative subversive acts
there is enough of these obscenities on the right and i always you must know this line of me
like to contrast at this level trump and bernie sanders trump appears neocon american values
fuck it in the way he functions isn't he the ultimate post-modern relativist obscene person
his the style how he works undermines his message while what i sincerely admire i'm not without
criticism of bernie sanders but what i really admire in him is that as a person
isn't he some kind of a i would almost say decent moral majority decent or i like this
out of any cheap radical statements you know this common sense decency and i met friends once i almost
met him because i have friends in burlington vermont he really functions like this it's not a fake now
that he is older you meet him sometime simply walking around burlington chatting with ordinary people and so on
so i wouldn't be afraid as a leftist to stop with this obsession of subversiveness and so on no
our answer should be being subversive chaotic undermining thing leave this to the new right we should
speak for a new decent order and i think that we should say we are the true moral majority to say like this
you know but at the same time don't misunderstand me then you will say but in what sense are you still
calling yourself a communist well i have a very simple reason it will be too simple maybe for you
but please counter-attack me i mean it sincerely not rhetorically just look we are facing a series of
crises today no there is uh of course ecology there is artificial intelligence how will be deal with it
there is militarization these social disorders it's for me absolutely clear that
not in the old sense central committee and so on but the only solution is communism in the very
elementary sense of larger trans national and trans state cooperation look just as ecological crisis there
has to be global cooperation look at what is happening around the northern pole do you remember a couple of
years ago three four summers ago when temperatures in vancouver seattle that part where the temperatures
of emirates 50 degrees celsius now you cannot say they should take care of it no it's clear they were
relatively well doing with their ecological measures but the whole air circulation around the northern pole
is perturbed that's why they also get now in northern siberia temperatures up to 35 degrees and so on so it's not
a local problem it must be approached globally that's all for me that is communism we will have to find the solution
now you will say so it's a world government no no no no in today's conditions don't you think
first it's not possible but also if you imagine it in today's condition a world government would have implied
breathtaking corruption and so on but my idea is something else
look at the effect of european union when it appeared that it's getting stronger
the stronger the stronger european union as a unity got it didn't squash oppress local identities i think
this is what fascinated me basques basque country catalonia even here wales and so on the idea is that
this reliance of europe as up to a point a super state meant that local communities ethnic or whatever
no longer had to totally rely on their own nation state you know that paradoxically european unity give
gives them more space so i don't see a contradiction between stronger europe and less local unities the
although we need an efficient state more than ever but a state will have to learn to reach
beyond itself international cooperation and this will then open up the space i have nothing against
local communities and so on i'm even all for you know when you say today local ways of life our way
of life should be maintained and if you say this in a wrong circle you're accused of being a fascist racist
i say no the problem for me with when white people say we want our way of life is that usually between the
lines they imply a universal dimension which is because we are the best and so on that's why i have
no you know who is my model here it may appear ridiculous to you i don't even like them i met them
tibetans and amish you know what's so beautiful about amish my source is not only that movie uh by harrison
fort or my sources i then read some books even met some of them they don't have any envy they don't
hate they call them the englishmen other whites the idea is we found our way of life you have yours
nice we can be friends and you know how wonderfully they collaborate for example they are not most of
them they have subgroups they are not allowed to have uh how do you call this uh phones so it's part
of the deal you need an emergency you run to a neighbor who phones the emergency what is important
is that our pseudo fundamentalists i'm ready to go so far as to distinguish between authentic
fundamentalists and pseudo pseudo fundamentalists have envy a typical right-winger in the u.s they
are secretly obsessed by can you imagine what gay people or lgbts are doing also every anti-semitism
works like this every hatred of arabs what they are doing among themselves no and it's the same with
tibetans it shocked me they don't have any expansionist logic or any hatred towards others
their idea is we found our way of life you can have yours there is no envy and so on so the problem for
me again is that when people refer to a specific way of life it's not that this notion as such is
racist you can be fully identified with a specific way of life of course i'm not an idiot there are
problems like to what extent should a larger community tolerate i don't know how you treat
women and so on and so i am for certain minimal standards but we should be aware of this distinction
again between between let's call it naively authentic fundamentalism which is simply i found my way of
life you stick with yours we can be good friends none of this destructive envy for example for tibetans
it's unimaginable to say han chinese or who they are our enemies we have to fight them and so on but to
conclude if you want back to trump you know where i see i did say this i see an antagonism in trump trumpian
populism which may but not necessarily destroy it they may survive and even use it and to strengthen
them on the one hand trump line is this populism and i like ironically although i'm ashamed to use the
term to refer to people like steve bannon as the left trumpians you know why why why steve bannon was fired
during the first trump rule from the white house because you know what he demanded publicly that the
taxes for the rich be raised from now is 25 percent maximum to 40 percent so uh but then you have guys
like uh elon musk and so on and they have a whole theoretical background it's something totally different
through their secret dream and that's behind i think trump's gaza project is to
slowly recreate new societies from the zero point they call this network states you empty a certain
space or you buy it from a state and through algorithms benevolent dictator experts you recreate
society from the zero point so and they even use the term recreate a new man you know what this means
we are worse stalinist than stalin himself i mean this idea of recreate a new man so this is the problem
for me with trumpianism but at the same time unfortunately it's strength do you remember his uh
inaugural speech oh my god the first one or second one uh the second one yeah no couple of you remember
he opens up with and then repeated a couple of times two horrible terms uh common sense and sanity
yeah but first uh you cannot return to old common sense it's obvious because all the problems that we
have today artificial intelligence uh ecology and others they do defy our common sense our common sense
sells us nature is the natural background we can screw things up but nature is a big circle it will
survive no nature is no longer the safe background on which you can rely it's the same with artificial
intelligence for years i'm attentive to that horror and this is you know i got two invitations i didn't
accept them which quite shocked me after my book which i don't like i didn't really succeed hegel in a
wired world i got an invitation not from uh elon musk himself but from his group who are doing this
neural link how and then you know who personally contacted me i didn't want to my god what connections i
have peter thiel the father of i mean robot father of of of of events you know and so i think that that's
the paradox of trump all this babble about return to common sense but what they are effectively doing is
enabling enabling an explosive process of destroying the last vestiges of what we are usually perceiving
as common sense and you we cannot prevent it i think that's the true revolution today trumpians are
escaping from it doesn't the very prospect of artificial intelligence even if you don't go to the end
this is for me pure horror uh neural link you know the idea of a direct link between not just your brain
your thoughts and digital machine so the digital machine can read your thoughts okay as usual people
cheat here those who they always give an example humanitarian example look a guy is crippled isn't it nice
that he just thinks about something like move that chair and it happens yeah but what goes on out
goes in this means that the machine can read your mind up to a point and who controls the machine then
we know where this leads so i'm not necessarily a pessimist here i'm not saying we will turn into robots i'm just
saying that something that we identified till now as a basic feature of being human which is reality is out
there my thought is in here this is the basis of our freedom freedom means i must to do something and
without acting directly in reality i can play different options in my mind this is this is in danger of
disappearing so i i'm not necessarily again a pessimist here it will happen i just think we should really
think about it in an open up way for example this may amuse you or readers i recently thought about
is it there something that artificial intelligence cannot do my point is not this conservative one
i'm much more open here i think that first who knows artificial intelligence doesn't have
aware self-awareness in our sense what if it will develop some kind of a spirituality of its own
which simply doesn't fit our our our our hierarchy you know it will have it will be something totally
different but on the other hand i tried to think naively about what artificial intelligence at least in
it's today a forum cannot do and we came debating with them to a very naive but nice option one daily
rituals of course you can make it do but you program it but you know this this always fascinated me how all
of us practically but i think all of us have some stupid daily rituals like you walk on a floor where there
are tiles in square and you shouldn't step on the same one two times or what this is something very
interesting because i'm against some stupid psychoanalytic interpretation here
it's just that you are confused and
these rituals don't have any meaning they just have the effect of meaning it appears that you
introduce some minimal order i think that artificial intelligence cannot do it of its own you can
program it to do it but that's different another thing more interesting i follow jack lacong who says
that the zero form of language is swearing curses off and so on he says that this is and he gives that
lacong a very nice reading of it his idea is is that swearing is not just frustration like you try to
do something you spill it it goes wrong you say it no swearing is always a reflexive act of language itself
you are mad that you confront a problem for which you don't even have a proper way to formulate it within
the language swearing is for me a sign of what hegel knew freud knew and so on that we live in language
absolutely but at the same time we are never fully at home in language there is always a gap our all
humanity depends on the fact that you cannot say what you want what you say can always mean socially
something that you didn't intend and so on and this gap opens up the space for swearing which is why
my favorite scene in did you see i think it was overestimated they didn't like it so much too naively
leftist wire the tv series you saw it do you remember in episode four or where there is a wonderful scene
where the two detectives enter a crime scene and they made something noticed here there and the whole
dialogue two three minute scene is fuck it oh fuck fuck fuck and so on that's communication at its purest
now again you can plan you can program artificial intelligence like this but i wonder
if they're if they can do it in this specifically human way which implies minimum of subjectivity and
subjectivity is always negative negative not in a complicated in the sense of you don't feel easy
in what you are you are at an you have certain place in society in language but
you don't you are not fully identified identified with it here i see problems but again i'm very
open who knows i don't believe in that of singularity you know all our self-awarenesses will be united in
one big one i would say no thanks you know what's my reaction to it there is a wonderful old it's not
even wonderful primitive old joke from brezhnev era soviet union there is a big poster there
good news in 20 years we will live in fully developed communism no and the guy starts to jump
then and sink and people ask me why are you doing this he said ah it's wonderful i have i have cancer i
will not be alive in 20 years when i read about singularities approaching i tend to have a reaction
of this guy but singularity is i think a typical human dream about what would have been a beyond
it's false but i'm totally open to the idea of something being beyond and this is
uh this is a real problem where ah sorry now i have a point maybe not against you but you are the guy
who has that uh communism of luxury uh fully automated luxury communism yeah okay i'm just you know that a
guy who is not exactly a leftist is obsessed with similar problems did you read uh uh nick bostrom's uh
deep utopia super intelligence but not deep utopia no sorry i read his first no but he deals precisely
systematically with this problem and uh i hope uh you where i don't agree with him but my problem is
you know we are the way we were formed by history
and if all of a sudden you live in a society of luxury in this simple sense that
you don't have to worry about material needs and so on what if this will be really traumatic for people
can they survive this i'm always a pessimist in the sense that i think that i think that
uh you know the big lesson of psychoanalysis is for me that something that appears to be an obstacle
is really a condition of what it is an obstacle to you know that's my eternal example for example i'm
sorry for male chauvinism of feminine beauty you know which example i usually quote trigger warning very
vulgar one it really happened to me a lady was flirting with me years ago now nobody flirts with
she told me you know my last lover told me when he saw me naked that if i just were to lose two pounds
my body would be perfect what i told her is just don't lose two pounds because the effect of perfection
comes comes precisely from the fact that you you are not perfectly perfect if you take the obstacle
you will be ordinary perfection is emerges so that's what i am afraid and you know i'm very empirical
here no deep marxist thinking but i say what i'm saying is that
for example it happened already under socialism in slovenia in the last years or a little bit before
late 60s early 70s were the golden era people lived in a relatively comfortable way at least in slovenia
and media started to notice that if by some
combination you know it happens that holidays get so well placed in the middle of the week and so on
but basically you are free for an entire week in local places there were many fights after two days of
enjoying it people got in conflict and so on so i'm more here and maybe i'm wrong but my psychoanalytic
not training i'm not for i mean like some students told me can i become your patient you know what's
my answer if you can even imagine me as your patient you must be really mad you
can you even imagine me listening patiently to a guy that no but what i'm saying is that
you know people maybe need to be occupied by something they are afraid of too much free time can
reply to that quickly yes no please answer in a very aggressive way as possible
so i agree with you um you've got the lacrosse but but yeah exactly there's uh lacrosse dangerous
liaisons which is about the french you know i know my god it's one of i should add that one
to one of the greatest novels yeah so they and they have all this free time they live in incredible
luxury they effectively live in post-scarcity conditions what do they spend all their time doing
intrigues heartbreak drama and i suspect in a post-scarcity society there would be a massive
increase in mental health depression anxiety oh so you're not an idiot that's all i wanted to hear
yeah or i would say you're not a complete idiot no not that i am no yeah there are only two types of
people i claim complete idiots and people who are not complete idiots there is no third so we would
have to you know kane's put it pretty well in his essay um on the possibilities to our grand i know i
know it's the classical essay from mid-30s yeah already we would have to we would have to basically
perform new kinds of human subjectivity for those conditions but how do you have any guarantee for me it
wouldn't be a problem because i'm an absolute workaholic being free of necessity it means i work
day and i think it would be as different to our society as our society is to hunter gatherer society
so we've already gone through a transition that big before haven't we right and i agree at some point
with you do we agree that marx was here wrong our society emerged mark it's not class society it's
before neolithic is the yeah all good historians neolithic is the we have only two great breaks
neolithic and then let's face it capitalism which destroys traditional hierarchic societies and so on
no i agree entirely yeah so again but nonetheless uh what's your
it's just we don't know what will happen it's deep sheet or do you have a hidden more positive formula
i think you know it would it would be like somebody 15 000 years ago when fewer you know
five million babies are born every two weeks on planet earth yeah 12 000 years ago there were
five million people right that's how much has changed in 12 000 years so i think trying to explain
to a hunter gatherer this is what um economic surplus looks like mathematics cities they
would say what the hell are you talking about anatomically the same as you and i yeah yeah
and i think a post scarcity society would be incomprehensible to us i still think it's something
to strive for because the problems in that society and they would exist would be better problems than
dying of waterborne disease as a child of homelessness yeah yeah freezing to death i think those are better
problems um but i think we'll always have problems the point is that what's the quality of the problems
i think they're superior problems to have yeah but i'm too scared even to guess specify what the problems
are you know whom you should read here in a wonderful text it's not one about army the role of military
communism it's about fred jameson no is fully aware of this he said who got this stupid idea that communism
will be just abundance he says envy depression will be the main problem and he then writes something
wonderful he says in communism there will be economic base and superstructure the base will be automated
communism superstructure will be some collective forms of psychoanalysis to control madness to control
envy depression and so on if you are saying this we are comrade communists here you know we should
focus and this you know in some society i already see it as reactions to this for example in china
it's not just a reactionary phenomenon i read a wonderful text very simple about another mass movement
it's not too much a mass movement and we shouldn't simply dismiss it as anti-feminist it's that many
women there are even in china thousands of women who are high on high executive positions
and many of them because with the new middle class what is relatively well paid is that if you are not
a dirty ordinary woman but appear nice educated that you uh simply do the cleaning you know come to a once
a week you go to an apartment you cleaning and they discover that if you do this in a well-planned way
you drop your high executive job you just go every day to clean an apartment for two three hours
life is much more calm happy and so on and i think it's too easy to say oh anti-feminist dream no
it's authentic experience you get rid of this pressure and so on but there are so many unknowns that i
even don't dare to guess what these problems will be you know as you said it's depression and so on all
that you know what i want to avoid here we are on the same side it's i don't want to draw from this the
conservative conclusion which is that oh so we need a little bit of oppression and so on no no that's too
simple like let's return you have even some pseudo lacanians who say today we are confronting the
catastrophic consequences of patriarchal of the lack of patriarchal authority so let's restore the
symbolic authority of the name of the father you cannot then you get trump then you get an obscene
authority and so on so i'm just don't know how to put it i feel so insecure there what will be this
problem but i agree with you if we don't screw it up before with some uh what you know that's why i'm
now doing uh quantum mechanics not yet seriously but i'm in very good contact there and wonderful people
with carlo rovelli lee smallin the big names they are fascinated that the philosopher crazy like me
is interested in their work and rovelli i had a brief exchange with him you know he's a leftist right
yes former well former leftist no no no no no you know what he wrote i told him listen uh we are in
deep street blah blah don't we need communism in just in the sense of larger unity and he said i agree
our survival can only be global confeder confederation and then he said the only question is will it
happen before or after the nuclear war he is very reasonable also in this dark sense he doesn't have too
many illusions about uh he doesn't have too many illusions about uh uh about uh new people's democracy this
idea that i think doesn't work today this you know democracy from below like you know local communities
and so on organizing themselves he is not in that but yes he is he still no no he still is that but
you know did you read my story you don't read you have uh right uh you know what fascinates me more
and more how even we know something is an illusion how it's in some sense a necessary illusion do you know
my story i don't want to repeat it about i'm quite proud of to applying that uh my good friend maybe the
best theories of catastrophes uh uh is it pierre bayar or who a french guy used the metaphor of do you
know this it's an old arab story but probably it wasn't invented by arabs how do you solve the problem of
11 camels you know the story no it's wonderful one very short don't be afraid a rich merchant rich not
even very rich for him is dying and he has three sons and his inheritance is 11 camels and he tells his
sons this is all yours but on condition that you divide them in a precise way the older
one gets half of the camels the middle son gets one fourth of the camels the younger son gets two
camels now there is a problem no because 11 can be divided by half or by any of these numbers so they
call a judge who has a solution he said i will add a camel of my own and then we go to work
you get half of the camels half of 12 is six you get one fourth it's three six and three it's nine
and you get two one sixth it's eleven and then they ask him what happens with the 12 camel he said
it doesn't even have to exist i take it back you know that's for me a good metaphor maybe for
religion it's i i was attacked but not by rowan williams i'm friendly with him when i when i told
him that's for me the best theory of god god is the 12 camel you know it doesn't exist but you add him and
you get that completes the whole yeah completes the whole you know so this is what fascinates me
more and more this idea of not illusions in this old-fashioned marxist way you know oh ideological
illusion but structurally much more necessary illusion so i'm an atheist because i think
to put in stupid terms got in this illusion but maybe it's a little bit more necessary illusion
structurally you know you cannot really work in language operate without the 12 camel has to be
there it doesn't have to exist but it has to be there slow boy but a pleasure again it pleasure was
mine and you know what really because i suspected i read some of your stuff but now you clarified it
i suspected you that with your idea of luxury communism i almost wasn't sure should i put you on my list when
the people take over of you go to gulag you know but now you convinced me you know no no no no you are
well aware it's not simply because even some idiots you have leftist guys heideggerians even who think
with this luxury communism we will all become heideggerians think about the fate of being like
a new space of metaphysics i was afraid that you have these temptations you know now you don't finish
in gulag but it really was a pleasure but again the tragedy today is that for quite a lot of people
it could be luxury and for each more complex so this was for me it may sound surprising to you
the most satisfying part that you are not comrade comrade like this maybe in some future you will
have to go to gulag but till that moment we can be friends
