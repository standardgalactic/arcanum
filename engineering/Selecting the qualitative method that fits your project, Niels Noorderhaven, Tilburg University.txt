reviewed for instance reviewed by more quantitative um scholars that you don't do random sampling
you do theoretical sampling and actually sampling is ongoing in time so as you proceed with your
research and as to the extent that you start understanding what might be going on you
deliberately pick your next uh uh uh point of entry to the to the to the fields and that may be another
organization it may be another you know uh informant within the same organization uh many different
things are uh possible so actually theoretical sampling and then the idea is that you continue
with this whole process until you have a theory that is sufficiently risk
rich plausible and consistent which we call saturation the next one please
now a very important thing is that um
ground theory is based on the principle of coding so uh encoding is a particular approach to doing
qualitative research which is not uh say embraced by all qualitative researchers
um code is a word or a phrase that you use to identify a chunk of data that can be uh you know
a part of a transcript of an interview but it can also be an observation
it could be many different things any type of qualitative data
next one yeah so now um in some uh approaches using coding there is the illusion that coding can be
like almost an automatic process you know if you do it in a very automatic way
then you know it would be uh objective now but that is not true because the decision to code a particular
chunk of data in itself already is an act of interpretation and so why you know is this
particular part of the interview interesting and the next part is not that is already based on an
interpretation of what it could what it could mean and how it could function ultimately in your in your
theory so it's it's never mechanical it cannot be and it should not be and it also reflects the the
research question if you have one i suppose in most cases you do have one and the theoretical perspective
now in classical grounded theory to be honest this idea of a theoretical perspective was frowned upon you
shouldn't start with a particular theoretical perspective and nowadays we understand that that is
actually impossible and you always if if not explicitly then at least implicitly have some
theoretical perspective which which which will guide your expectations but one important thing to
remember to to to to keep in mind is that coding is a fracturation of the data you you chop the data into
little pieces and this is completely different from what we will see in um classic case studies
where there is a much more holistic approach and so there normally you will not have a practice
like coding and you will try to to interpret the case and understand the case in its entirety
not not cutting up the data in little chunks uh the next one please louisa now there are a number of
different steps in this process um as i already said you you if you do pure classical grounded theory you
will not have a theory to start with you will not have any theoretical confidence guiding your research
so what you do then is open coding and so the the coach emerge from the data uh and uh so they are not
existing the opposite uh approach would be that you have particular concepts and you try to recognize
those in your data so for instance you would have a concept like organizational identification and you
would look in your data for all the instances where things that respondents say um a point at some some
level or form of organizational identification and in classical grounded theory it's the opposite
there is no concept to start with the concept emerge from the data so open coding so then you have a
number of concepts then you start with comparing those actual coding make relationship between them
maybe you know you can collect some codes or maybe you can split up codes or you can juxtapose codes
this is the opposite of of that or this is is leads to that and so uh you start making connections
and then the final step would be theoretical or sometimes called selective coding where you say okay
what is the core theme of my investigation what is what what the phenomenon that i really want to
understand and explain and then you start systematically linking all the other codes that you have
created to that uh core theme so maybe the next slide louisa so here's an example from my own work
an older paper where we were interested in consensus at the interface between uh uh the business
interface between japanese and uh uh dutch firms so obviously and this was done very much in a classical
grounded uh theory way so the ultimately the the the the uh the core theme were the attributes of
consensus which differed between the japanese and and the dutch and then we said okay what are
in the in the views of those uh informants uh antecedents of consensus and are they the same for
dutch respondents as for for for japanese respondents and what are the consequences
of uh of consensus so what you very often see in this type of research is that this is a kind of an
organizing missing organizing mechanism you have this central uh theme which you you know is the center of
your attention what is causing it and what is caused by it and that is that is but it could also be
different but this is something you see a lot next one please
so now there has been a lot of criticism of classical grounded theory and i think uh with good reasons
uh so we will see it it lives on very much i think many many uh qualitative researchers nowadays
call themselves grounded theory researchers but they do things in different ways uh so one very obvious
criticism is that the original idea of glazer and strauss that their observations would be theory free is
simply untenable that is not possible we we are not capable of observing the world without somehow you
know being guided by expectations and the expectations of course are formed by our theories implicit or explicit
and so it's also um uh uh yeah i mean it's a bit naive this would be pure induction and pure induction i think
is uh is simply impossible now another thing is if you look at uh especially the early formulations of uh
grounded theory uh the idea was that you are completely free in where you go uh what will be that the next uh
step in your research where will you go now um so that that suggests complete freedom of choice in
in selecting your informants and selecting the organizations where you will do research etc
well of course that is not the reality for most of us and we have restrictions so um in many cases you
have to uh uh you know agree beforehand with an organization how many interviews you will do
uh you know who will be interviewed who notes etc uh and you have limited time so we cannot simply afford
to go on and on and on with our research until we have some form of saturation we have mostly we have
a first uh fixed time uh uh available fixed period of time available and then it needs to be finished
so that is also something that uh really is not not very realistic anymore
um yeah finally no not finally but the next point is that uh there was also something strange going on
in the idea of glacier and strauss that um the theory so it's just discovery of grounded theory so
the theory somehow was expected to be already out there in the fields and that is also an idea that of
course does not resonate very much nowadays and so the theory is in our minds not in the fields
the theory is something in our minds that helps us to make sense of what we see in the real world
and so we should really see that as social constructions and not as something that is inherent
to reality and then some other some maybe minor things very often at least in the past
the phrase grounded theory was used as a kind of an excuse to you know i'm not going to discuss the
literature i'm just going in you know the fields with a uh a a a blanco a blank sheet and and but
you cannot ignore the literature that's impossible uh sorry it doesn't work you know a lot of research
would then simply replicate what has been done already uh what are you doing there yeah uh and sometimes
also and that is also something that that uh really doesn't work uh it's a routine technique
yeah so it's just a kind of a cookbook method if you follow the steps you will have good research
but like i said you know the core of grounded theory is uh coding and coding is not and can never be
a a mechanical routine uh uh procedure yeah it always implies that you are interpreting
what you are seeing otherwise you know we couldn't we wouldn't be able to code okay the next one please
okay so that's that's that's classical grounded theory now classic case studies and and we will
see this is really something quite different so this is a research method that involves investigating
one or a small number of social entities or situations about which data are collected using
multiple sources of data i think that is an important part and developing a holistic description
through an iterative research process so there are some similarities this iteration there you go
from the from the from the fields from the data collection to your interpretation to your
theorizing back to the field etc so that is something which is very different from the uh the procedures
in quantitative research where you're supposed to have your hypothesis ready before you go into the
fields of course we all know that it's not always the case but at least that is the ideal
we want to live up to now that is not the case in qualitative research and not the case in
classic case studies either so and and typical is that you have many variables you may have only one
case but a lot of things are going on so from a statistical or mathematical point of view that wouldn't
make sense so you would would need many more cases than variables but in case study research the the idea
is you you can have many variables and just one or just a few cases next one please
so and the reason is that we are interested in a configuration of variables it's not like measuring
variables isolated from one another it's it's the whole set of variables together
or factors if you want to avoid the word variables that helps us understand what is going on in a case
and so there is really i think a a a great uh contrast between case studies and a grounded theory
so case studies typically don't use code coding if you want to to write a case study you are interested in
the story as a whole and that is very different from you know cutting up the data in small parts and
making comparisons between those data chunks and connecting those data chunks so it's it's a very
different way so if you if you use interviews to write a case study you will do that in a different way
than when you use case studies to do grounded theory and so case studies are particularly
fat fits for exploring how and why types of questions uh how uh that means that you would spell out
or or or uncover uh mechanisms or change of causality something happens because something else happened
before and we know that causality is as is is particularly difficult to establish also in
quantitative research so a lot of quantitative research is of a correlational nature actually
rather than being able to to establish causality now of course case studies being just a study of one
or a few cases can also never give certainty about causality cause effect relations but they can
uncover the mechanisms that link cause and effect and in that sense make it more plausible that there is
indeed a causal relationship than when we would just have data you know a data point before and a data
point after and we don't know what connects these two so that's the how question and the other one is
the why question uh that is case studies can also be used to understand why actors in a particular situation
let's say an organization that was in a situation of crisis why they acted in a particular way what do the
actors think they are up to to borrow the phrase from clifford gears okay next one please
yeah so now i will move to the the present day methods these two joya methods which is strongly rooted
in grounded theory and the eisenhart method which is a a more we could say a contemporary form of
case studies uh case studies uh in in the case of eisenhart always multiple cases uh starting with joya
next one yeah yeah so joya very clearly is a a a present day uh a version of grounded theorizing
using coding uh typically uh but what is very specific to this particular way of doing qualitative
research is the emphasis on the transparency with regard to the trail of evidence so very important
and actually uh according to joya himself and i i think i agree the strong point of this method is
that you actually can show the readers how you came from your let's say your your your observations or
interviews to your theoretical concepts so the methods is particularly used to understand how actors
create interpretations of organizational reality and act on these interpretations so joya
says you know i will uh bend backwards to try to understand the phenomenon that i'm studying
in the uh in the in the using the concepts and the language of the actors living in that reality and so
trying basically to to to to look with from the perspective of people in the field and then make
the next step and say okay how can i as a researcher understand that um it is mostly used in an abductive
way so not pure induction so normally you will start with some theoretical concepts but in the course of
this of the research you may uh you know unearth new emerging themes or concepts or you may split up
concepts uh uh into into into subcategories etc so next one please
so now one one back so um it's there's something very similar going on as what we saw with glazer and
strauss also again three uh steps in the coding process you start with what joya calls first order codes
which are basically chunks of raw data what are interesting relevance observations and you you put a
label to it in the case of joya if possible a label expressed in the language of the uh of the uh
informant then the second step would be trying to you know make relationships between these concepts
these emerging concepts so you know they can be you know brought together they are particular instances
of the same general theme uh or they can be different or they can they can have course effect relations
etc etc and then ultimately you uh order them in what he calls third third order themes or dimensions
which are the main building blocks of your theory now if you go to the next slide
this is an example back on this is an example uh of uh a a paper where we looked at how managers
try to influence the interpretations of employees during uh the post-merger integration process uh
sensegiving and we said okay looking at what we see in the data so we started with thanksgiving we knew
that we wanted to study sensitive but actually going through the data we found that there were very
different things going on sometimes management really wanted to to um uh silence particular
interpretations and what we call sense breaking or sense hiding actually that sense breaking was given
another meaning to what people actually said uh and sense specification is okay yes what you say is going
on but we give it a slightly different uh uh meaning so different forms of sensegiving were one of the
things and then sensegiving was one of the main building blocks of the theory that we made based on
those observations but what we see here is very typical of the joya matters the data structure so the data
structure really is the is the core of this particular methods and it the strength of this is that it's um
allows you to see how particular uh dimensions and concepts are rooted in the data so on the left hand
side in the ideal case there are concrete observations or or or quotes from interviews the the the more
concrete the better and then on the right hand side the more you go to the right hand the more
theoretical it becomes but it gives an overview very clearly of how you you know how you came to your
conclusions ultimately right next one please
so one one back
there are some concerns like with every method also about the joya methods
so some people think it's a bit naive to think that what participants say and do in social settings
you know what you base your research on uh that it actually gives you insight in their authentic inner
worlds and they might manipulate uh you uh and to a certain extent that of course is true
uh so it's not uh beyond criticism uh some people say well you know this is abduction so you always start
already with some theoretical concept so what are the chances of you finding really something new
um i would say maybe okay but what are the chances that any of us in our academic career find something
really new and most of us you know work in in in the further development of theories the refinement of
theories and uh there are only only only few researchers who really come up with something new
so i don't think that is a very serious uh problem the the third bullet point maybe is and here we also
find the big difference between someone like joya and someone like eisenhart so eisenhart would be
skeptical about the possibility of really developing theory based on on a single uh case she would say
well you know only if i can compare and contrast cases that will give me a solid empirical basis for
developing a theory and the the the next one is actually i think um uh also a serious one uh
especially since uh the joya method method is is is quite often nowadays applied as some kind of
cookbook methods you know if you follow the steps you will get you know a publishable paper but there is
one big uh uh problem joya has never made clear and probably cannot make clear how you come from
you know this more or less mechanical or routine process of you know going through the data and you
know going from uh raw data in in a couple of steps to theoretical dimensions you know how to find
good novelty how to make make make uh make it interesting and that is not something uh that is
self-evident so that you can do a lot of research you can do all the work you know and and you know
come up just with dull generalizations uh and then final point yeah nowadays there's there's quite some
pushback from uh uh reviewers from journals who say well you know this is the there have been see i've
seen so many papers that that try to to uh apply this joya methods in a mechanical way uh can't you think
of something else and so it should not be something that be becomes very uh uh uh yeah uninspired and and
routine next one please okay and then uh finally the eisenhart methods which is uh in many ways yeah
contrasting uh with the joya methods uh so uh this is here there is where whereas in joya the idea was
you know we want to basically understand the reality the socially constructed reality from the perspective
of people in the field here the idea is no i want to understand objective reality uh not so much you
know the lived reality or the perspectives of uh uh participants so a different uh uh way of looking at
it so the justification of this type of research typically is that it's phenomenon based i see an
interesting phenomenon uh but we do not have a satisfactory theory that is if you look at eisenhart's
work and and people following this methods this is typically how it starts we we see a particular
phenomenon we don't understand like for instance you know we know a lot about uh you know once there
is a particular social network with a particular structure we know that that structure uh leads to
you know giving more opportunities to some players and and and fewer to others but how does the structure
come about yeah so that type of question could be asked typically well multiple cases she says it's
really starts with four cases and above 10 it becomes problematic so between four and ten uh cases but
as i will show later and sometimes you know you can have cases within cases and i'll show an example again
from my own work where we had eight cases within one particular uh post-merger integration process
so it can be cases within case or sometimes your your opportunities to use the
eisenhart methods are maybe bigger than you think if you think of only one case now maybe you have
multiple cases within that case and in this research the common dimensions across cases are emphasized
uh whereas in the joya method it's more about the uniqueness of the case that is emphasized yeah the
next one please so here also again theoretical sampling uh so uh in that sense it looks a bit like a
grounded theory by the way katie eisenhart calls herself a grounded theorist so although she doesn't follow
those standards so uh in this case in eisenhart's case it would typically be a selection of cases at the
start of the research and she in her in her on the the previous slide i've given some uh you know
titles of papers where she describes her method and she typically starts with you know um you know
a number of firms in a particular industry at a particular point in time
uh and and then compares how they are doing and what are they doing differently that leads to these
different results um so it could be interviews uh but it could also be others katie eisenhart is
very much into you know collecting any type of data you can including quantitative data
uh the interviews will be very different different from those in a joy approach where it's more like
um you know why did you do particular things what was your motivation to do so what was your
impression what were your perceptions maybe even what were your emotions eisenhart was more what was
happening when who did what a courtroom style questioning trying to find the objective truth
and again data collection and data analysis like in the other approaches typically overlap the next one
please so the first step would be normally to to write a case narrative so understand each of the
cases that you study as a whole so this would be a bit like the classical case method but it's just the
first step because the real beef is in the cross case comparison so the within case narrative very
often will not even be in the final paper because they take too much space so you will maybe summarize
the cases in a table or something but the narratives you use you use it's a step that is necessary for
yourself to have full understanding of what happens within the cases before you start comparing
comparing them and there there's the real i would say core of this methods how can you compare these
cases and she gives a number of tips on how you could could do that you know you could have different
categories small firms big firms uh and then say okay how do the small firms differ uh from the big
firms how they are are they similar to each other that type of thing pairwise comparison you know where
you have uh you know the the most extreme cases maybe had polar cases uh also sometimes comparison
of different types of data you know i have maybe data on market shares and i have data on you know how
companies think they uh they have performed and you know do they point in the same direction we have
well-performing firms according to management and we have well-performing firms in uh in terms of their
sales figures are there differences between those and and why so that there are many ways in which you
can compare these cases next one please
and then uh you start building the emergent theory uh very important are the constructs so whereas joya
normally talks about concepts uh eisenhart talks about constructs uh and and these constructs are
typically illustrated in a table uh maybe go to the next one now and then we can go back to this one
uh oh no one more yeah so this is would be an example of a construct table uh so speed of strategic
decision making so on the vertical axis we see the the cases zap forefront promise triumph etc and then we
see uh some data about uh on the right hand side there is a number how many months this did the decision
uh process take so there's a good example i think that um of how different types of data are are mixed
typically in the eisenhart approach maybe you can go two back now louisa
yeah so uh these construct tables are very important so for for uh joya the data structure
is the core you could say and for eisenhart the construct table is the core and now i think an
important thing is that and these things you know don't come automatically so what you see in the work of
eisenhart is a kind of a mutual calibration between data and constructs because you need to find
a level of abstraction that makes it theoretical enough but at the same time provides a good fit
with your data and an example that came to my mind you know preparing for today was a paper from
2018 by hannah and eisenhart about the residential solar energy markets in california where she
based on her data distinguishes between three strategies three types of strategies that these
firms have the bottleneck strategy the component strategy and the system strategy now these are rather
specific um constructs that fits this particular industry in that particular time frame uh and and
which are at a very different level of generalization and abstraction than for instance uh porters uh
generic strategies so i think part of the art of of doing eisenhart type of research is finding you know
the right level of abstraction of your of your of your constructs they fit the data very closely and
they are abstract enough to allow theorizing okay go please go to the next one and then as in all
theorizing of course it is about the why so why are is there a relationship between for instance having a
particular uh strategy and uh leading to a particular outcome and she says well you know there can many
things can can help uh you can help you find it one particular source could be the explanations provided
by your informants which would also be a a key uh factor for joya but what she calls you know the more
detached logic of the researcher would also play a role so you you're not you're not stuck with the
explanations that the informants give you you can actually rise above that and say okay this is what
how they see it but for me with my more let's say theoretical background i can also see that there
might be a different more theoretical explanation and then you have to weave that into
a coherent theoretical story so you see there's a lot of art here in in the in the in the joya
approach as well as in the eyes and dark approach it's it's it's not something that you do automatically
it's it's art um okay next one please that we have that one next one okay now just to reiterate the
the the the the differences and i think this is important so um in most cases you would you you
should do either joya or is it okay um so eisenhart is more positivist looking for objective reality
uh joya interpretive uh is an interpretive researcher that lived reality eisenhart emphasis
on objective facts and events joya subjective perceptions and meanings eisenhart uh is more
interested in representative cases so if she studies the solar energy market in in in in california she
studies cases of firms that are you know representing the whole uh gamma of of of firms uh uh active in
in that particular markets geographically and in terms of the time frame um uh yeah so enjoy i
think there is a there's more emphasis on also developing new concepts eisenhart more on relationship
between concept that might already have been known or our specifications of concept that we already knew
so there are quite some differences between the two yeah maybe the next one
now um i'm very uh pragmatic in these things and i think i know i there's not one particular methods or
approach that i am you know locked into uh i believe in horses for courses meaning that you select
whatever fits your interest and your you know uh research question uh or your data if you can go to
the next one uh louisa yeah so typically typically you know people would say okay i first have a research
question this research question dictates the type of data that i need now if your research question for
instance is about what motivates managers to you know do a particular thing uh then you would have
to interview managers if your research question would be more like you know what happens to companies
when they make losses in three consecutive years you would need financial data and so the research
question is assumed to lead to the type of data that you need which then leads to the the research
method that you need but i think you know you can also look at it differently sometimes you have access
to data interesting data and then you start thinking okay what is the question that i can answer using
those data or you have a bad methods you want to use a particular research method okay fine with me you want
to use that research method what is the question that fits that and what are the data that that fit that
so for me you know you can start at any point in this triangle uh maybe go to the next one and that's
already the final one so from that perspective uh you know you can more easily make a choice between
these two main approaches that i've discussed so for joya in those cases where the informants view
is vital when you're interested in the lived experience yeah that that is then you use that method
uh or you are interested in articulating new concepts uh take joya or you know you have access
to interview and observational data but not really numbers and maybe only one case joya is the man
now on the other hand if you're more interested in the objective truth
if you're interested in explaining outcomes company results you know why is company a successful and
company b not eisenhart is more the way to go uh if you're interested in combining data from different
sources and different types if you have access to multiple cases maybe the eisenhart methods is better
for you and sometimes you can actually combine them sometimes you can you can say okay i i have i
objectively know and i'll show an example in the next slide i objectively know what happened in the
number of cases but i also want to know you know what that how that was interpreted uh and perceived by
people in that reality and we may have various types of data there and and but of course then
you also need multiple cases and if you can go to the next one
that is an example again for my own work sorry for that but here what i already mentioned we had one
single uh post-merger integration process but we observed that in different parts of the
organizations there something very different was going on so some of some of the departments or
units were fully integrated between the two companies others there was just you know some
selective displacement of tasks say some something that one company wouldn't do anymore and the other
would do uh there were some that were you know hardly integrated at all so we said okay these are
actually eight different cases and to be honest you know it was a reviewer who at a certain moment said
to us well you know because we as you see also in our this is part of the data structure so if you have
multiple cases why don't you use eisenhart uh so in the end we we ended up with combining actually
eisenhart elements and joya elements so it can be done uh but you must be aware of what you're doing then
because it you can also antagonize some of the reviewers if you do so so that is an example of
you know uh it's not black and white there are also uh shades of gray in between sometimes you can
borrow a bit from one method and introduce in the other but you must be aware of what you're doing
and maybe next the next slide i think is the final one almost the final one so i've just discussed
these but of course there's much more going on in qualitative uh uh research you know your process
studies which lean a little bit more to the joya uh sides although fewer process researchers are tend
to be critical about the more cookbook nature of of the joya approach you have any more and not
ethnographic studies eisenhart says she does ethnographic work but i think most ethnographers would not
probably agree with her and you have the the text as data studies that you nowadays the discourse type
of studies that are blooming and and which are not easy easily you know locked into either of these two
so there's much more going on but i've just you know focused on on these two main uh representatives
at this moment and next one please yeah that's it and uh we have some time for questions uh thank
you very much nils uh for your very comprehensive presentation and also providing us with several
alternatives that one can abuse uh so let me open up the floor to questions from um please use your
electronic hand and in this way we can identify you or even your physical hand
accept it as well
uh maybe i can uh kick off uh the q a session until people uh come up with their questions and
i i have seen some pre-submitted questions so one of them uh would be asking to clarify a little bit or
to talk about mixed methods in light of what you presented about qualitative studies qualitative research
answer yeah so um that is a that is a difficult issue um i i think that in theory mixed methods
could be great i've i have little experience i've published one mixed methods paper uh to be honest
not more than that uh but it's it's typically something that will be very difficult to get published
uh because you some of the reviewers will like your uh like your quantitative part but not your
qualitative part and vice versa so uh that is difficult plus there is another difficulty that
probably all of us know i mean it's always difficult enough to keep your paper within you
know the word count and the page count uh that that the journals prescribe uh and you know with mixed
methods that would be even worse because you have two findings sections you have two method sections
and it becomes really problematic uh having said so uh sometimes it it can work uh but uh
yeah i i would i would not advise uh to to to to try it and what can work sometimes you know if
if actual reviewers ask you do you also have some you know some qualitative evidence for instance
that is that's great okay now now you can put it in or vice versa might also happen but uh do you have
some you know quantitative material supporting your conclusions it might happen uh but more often you
find that okay if you were saying okay your quantitative analysis is fine but you know can you
breathe some more life in it with some qualitative examples okay great if you have those yeah
all right right thank you um there is one question on the chat box um
so when dealing with qualitative methodologies sample sizes always comes as a limitation
so what would be your advice as to how many would be enough taking for example a case study
yeah so that depends very much on your question uh so uh if you if you have very you know rich data
and deep access in a single case that can be sufficient to do interesting work um
for other questions you will need to compare between cases and then you know
you know it starts it starts obviously with two but then probably you have more value if you can add
some some additional cases uh but again you know above 10 it becomes quite unmanageable in a truly
qualitative study and then uh uh you would probably have a qca type of study earlier than rather than
uh than pure qualitative work so yeah i mean again horses for courses so i i believe in the in the in
the strength of a single case if you focus on questions that can be answered by that single case
and we will always have limitations in generalizability of course
uh there is another question by olga uh which is about well she asks you mentioned that coding is
not suitable for the classical case studies can you give examples of how to analyze case studies data
that is a good question so if you look at the classical case studies there typically is
very little information about how um the researcher came from the data to his or her conclusions
um uh so because you know if you have very rich data uh what stops you from just very selectively
quoting from that data um you know to draw whatever conclusion you want to come at so that is
that is a fundamental point which is actually echoed in eisenhart's work eisenhart uh is also uh quite um
let's say uh uh in transparent in the steps that she takes in the in the data analysis that is i think a big
uh a big uh contrast between eisenhart methods and joya method joya step by step you know you show what
you do uh and eisenhart it's it's but she says it's also difficult if not impossible because i have
these multiple cases you know if i also then step by step then simply you know it becomes a book rather
than a paper um now um so in classical case studies there was very little uh i think the uh in in in
eisenhart's multiple multiple case study it's very much tied to the the development of constructs
so you you develop these constructs that are that are relevant are important to understand those cases
and you illustrate them very thoroughly with as much material as you as you can um but to be honest
there are also very different ways of writing case studies which are much more let's say yeah
impressionistic if you like so there's not one you know approved and generally accepted methods
great thank you nils another question um would you recommend mixing the classical ground grounded theory
method with the joya method for instance study designs uh feeds the classic grounded theory but
you can use joyous data structure to show how you have developed your uh theoretical codes
now well i to be honest um but this is my personal opinion i think classical grounded theory has
outlived its uh it's uh you know uh usability it's i think um the joya method is a much more realistic
and and uh yeah uh uh acceptable way of doing grounded theory so you will do grounded theory but avoiding
some of the disadvantages of of the glazer and strauss approach so i i don't i don't see much value in
going back to those uh to those uh prescriptions uh by the way panels there are also some questions in
uh uh okay in your in in the chat i think i don't know to what extent they have been covered
well these are the ones i have been using but oh okay um yeah yeah uh there is there are a couple of
questions that were submitted before the talk on uh different software packages and tools that may
be recommended so do you want to comment on that yeah i don't have a lot to say there to be honest i
i i worked on i worked with two different packages uh atlas di and max qda for two different papers but my
conclusion basically was that it didn't help me that much so what i now do oh what i've done most of
the time and still do mostly is simply use excel i put i put uh these uh quotes etc in excel and and
you know use that to organize and maybe it's not the most advanced and sophisticated methods but it works
for me um but that is very personal but don't expect miracles from the software that is i think
something you know it's it can help you it's it certainly can help you uh to uh you know do more
efficiently this this this just you just you know going through the data and and you know reorganizing
the data but in the end it will be your decisions that count by the way something that's you know can
be extremely helpful and i wish you know that that that's uh would have existed when i was doing most of
my qualitative research uh that is the the software you nowadays have like chat gtp to transcribe
interviews that is really good and uh you know uh if i if i recall how much i spent uh having my
interviews transcribed in india and then getting them back and you know having made having to make so
many uh you know improvements it's that you know this this is much better now faster and less costly
yeah um there is one question about uh dealing with reviewers so it seems to me that the viewers will
not accept an analysis that is not based on codes and preferably on the joya method nowadays and the
single case study okay seems to uh out of the question how can we convince on the contrary
yeah so i'm not so pessimistic about that so uh firstly uh you know uh eisenhart and her students and
people working in that tradition get their work published in a strategic management journal and
academy of management journal all the time so apparently but of course what what counts here is
that um eisenhart and her students get very very good access to companies so that is something that
helps and that we you know simple mortals uh sometimes uh you know can envy uh can envy her for
so i think if you have good access to to data et cetera you can publish also uh you know without any
coding um and the single case again you know i see papers published on on single cases that uh
yeah i don't think that in itself is necessarily an impediment but make if you have if you have really
rich data if you have a single case and your data are not you know that deep and rich yeah then it
becomes difficult if you have multiple cases and your data are less rich you can you know you can
compensate for the lack of richness and you know by by making those comparisons but if you have a
single case it really needs to be in depth and hopefully something interesting comes out of it
in the interest of time i think i will ask one last question from the chat box which is
uh the person asks for the first order coding in joya we do it based on the literature so somehow we
already have a theory before our theory beforehand is it still congruent with the joya method um
i i yeah i i understand the question um uh i think it would not be uh uh saying conform to the joya
methods if that would be the end of the story so i think that it's very important that you you keep
your eyes open for maybe unexpected observations actually that is also what makes the research
interesting you know you find something that you know you didn't even think about or maybe it's
contrary to your uh expectations and then make the most out of this so um what is interesting
interesting is something that goes against you know what people conventionally think or or expect
so if you can find something like that you know for instance a causal relationship is the other way
around from what people think you know uh then you know then you probably you know you you have the
the material to write a an interesting paper that has a good chance of being published if you if you
yeah somehow you know you have to find the that the the nugget of gold that makes your work yeah
interesting to read i'm sure we could continue uh endlessly the discussion uh in the interest of time
we will need to draw this webinar to a close so i would like to express our special thanks to nils
for sharing with us his expertise and wisdom and we have all learned a lot today about
qualitative research and also the different contingent contingencies that may apply in how to deal
with them so let's give him a an electronic round of applause okay thank you for attending and
alessandro for uh helping with the organizing the organization of the of this of the webinar thank
you very much thank you nils thank you panos great seminar and i understand that the slides will be
uh downloadable from the your own website yeah okay everyone bye bye thanks for attending
well okay i guess i can close it yeah i think everybody is uh moving out okay maybe you can stay just a little
bit you have maybe a question i wanted to ask you uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh this this this project that we do on the history of Europe uh-huh so um we must find a moment that
we can think about okay what are some of the historical materials that you may still have
at the office so I was wondering for instance um is there anything you know photos and things
like that that you have from the periods when uh uh Yasum was still at the in the Rudeck Monde
uh I've looked at the internet if there are any materials you know from that time but I couldn't
find anything I will have to ask my colleagues because evidently I wasn't there yet okay you
came in later yeah yeah we had if you look at the the um the first meetings that we had that was in
the Rudeck Monde uh okay yeah I have I have the minutes of all those meetings yeah the minutes
but I would I think you know it would be really nice if you have some you know atmosphere so yeah
the only person that's a thought that came up with me because Peter asked me to talk briefly about uh
this project uh tomorrow in the federal meeting and I thought you know um the more uh uh uh materials
that we have to make it to enliven it you know that's that and would be much nicer than just text
um of course yeah yeah yeah so let's let's think about it so if you maybe you know if you come
across colleagues that they may know okay we had that meeting or whatever and some pictures were
taken I don't know yeah yeah nowadays of course there's much more material but at that time you
didn't actually make pictures that much no we didn't make pictures with the phones that's the
oh that's a big difference yeah so I I will see what's in the files because I I don't see where
else I can look for it don't I don't you know just keep you keep your keep your mind open for and
maybe ask some people who have been around for a long time okay good uh okay and that was it
you know someone once once in a bit late I don't think there's much use to that well some people get
the time difference wrong yeah I think so probably that's what's going on okay so it was okay I think
it worked well this uh I'm okay I'm happy I think it was a bit uh yeah I mean it was not much
there weren't many questions afterwards but it's okay no no okay okay see you soon bye bye Niels bye bye
