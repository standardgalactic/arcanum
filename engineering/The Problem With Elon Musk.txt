uh i mean my mind is a storm i don't think most people would want to be me they may think they'd
want to be me but they don't they don't know is your storm a happy storm no
i've grown tired of hearing the name elon musk and not really understanding what's going on
who is this guy where is he from how has he built a huge business empire to become one of
the richest people in the world and what can we learn about his purchase of twitter so i've been
going on a deep dive finding everything i can about this guy his upbringing businesses he started
talking to people who have worked with him who have worked for him many of these people want to
remain anonymous for reasons you will soon understand i've talked to people who love him
people who hate him people who used to love him and now hate him if i were an employee at twitter
right now i'd probably just do your job don't let them know your name so after a few months of
reporting on this i feel like i finally have a handle on who this guy is i understand how he
built his empire how he treats the people around him and the real reason i believe he bought twitter
elon musk put in an offer an unsolicited bid to buy the social media platform 44 billion dollars so let
me show you the rise and rule of elon musk you're a super villain that's what a super villain does yeah
he's addicted to drama he's addicted to risk and whenever things seem to be going smoothly
he almost has a compulsion to stir things up
elon musk was born in the summer of 1971 in south africa from a young age he was bullied pretty
relentlessly by kids at school for being scrawny and nerdy you know bullied quite a lot i punched
the face many times musk would later say that he's on the autism spectrum though he was never diagnosed
it got really bad for young elon like one time when he got beaten up at school once and so bloodied
he had to go to the hospital the scars were actually worse when he came home and his father
made him stand in front of him and berated him for more than an hour calling him stupid saying it was
his fault stories like this make me sick to my stomach and you realize that the trauma and scars from
this kind of abuse both physical and emotional they don't go away easily speaking of his dad
there's a lot of rumors that elon came from a rich dad who owned emerald mines in south africa
and that he was set up to be successful because of family wealth this isn't factually accurate elon's
dad did import emeralds but there wasn't a lot of money in this family he never owned a a emerald mine
this is total bullshit if you want more detail on that you can go check out our sources where we put
the fact check for every one of the assertions in this video anyway what elon did have at a young age
was a skill for computers and programming i taught myself how to program computers mostly because i
wanted to program games at the age of 12 he invented a video game mom do you remember when i was 12 and i
created my own video game that he sold to a magazine for 500 it was his first business move in tech
his first interest in space around 12 or 13 i had come in existential crisis trying to figure out the
meaning of life from an early age musk found meaning in the idea of the potential of humanity what humans
can do as a collective how we as a species have somehow been able to work together to explore
the meaning of the universe my motivation was that if we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness
maybe we can find out the meaning of life i mean you hear this and it kind of sounds overly grand kind
of delusional overly idealistic but honestly this is what motivates musk from a very young age and he
doesn't bend on what he wants and what he's willing to do to achieve it so he leaves south africa when
he's 18 and moves to canada and eventually ends up in pennsylvania where he goes to college and gets a
degree in economics and physics at the age of 24 he moves out to california to pursue a phd at stanford
but he never starts the program instead he starts his first business
okay so i'm not going to go into the details of every one of elon's companies because there are a
lot if you want to deep dive read this very thick book this was a foundational part of our reporting
and it details the play-by-play on all of these companies for now let me give you a quick summary
of the businesses this guy built to become one of the richest men on the planet his first company was
called zip two he started it in 1995 with his brother who seems to have an affinity for cowboy
hats his company provided maps and business directories for online newspapers i know those
words sound very strange to us now but like back in 1995 it was a huge deal it almost was like the
precursor to what google maps is today and it was very successful we helped bring online several hundred
newspapers that previously were only in print it was acquired a few years later for 307 million
dollars 22 million of those dollars going right into elon's pocket suddenly elon is rich receiving
cash is cash i mean those are just a large number of van franklin's he uses the money to start another
company called x.com no no no not that x.com the first x.com which you now know today as paypal
so this is an atm what we're gonna do is transform the traditional banking industry it was basically
an online bank and it was revolutionary at the time so much so that in 2002 ebay bought it for 1.5
billion dollars elon got 180 million of those dollars and now he's officially super rich there
is gentlemen the fastest car in the world so what to do with all of this money the answer for elon musk
was to try out the craziest ideas he could think of well i had like about 180 million from paypal
i thought you know i'll allocate half of that to spacex and tesla and solar city that should be
fine i'll have 90 million like just lots i thought our probability of success was less than 10 percent
it would be foolish to think anything else other than that
ever since he was a kid making video games about space elon has been motivated by this idea of humans
expanding outside of earth humans becoming a multi-planet species we would like to help make
life multi-planetary the extension of life to multiple planets in the early 2000s tesla already
existed they were making electric cars but they were kind of high-end niche sports cars elon was
really interested in this so he came in as an investor and eventually became the ceo with the vision
of turning electric cars mainstream and ushering a whole new era of transportation but these ideas
were more expensive than he anticipated things cost more took longer than than i thought so i had a
choice of either put the rest of the money in or the company's gonna die his rockets kept blowing up
his electric cars were devilishly complicated to manufacture but elon developed this addiction to
risk and intensity that kept him pushing forward despite these challenges tesla reinvented how cars were
made thanks to innovative technology and manufacturing really clever engineering and
a waterfall of government subsidies he was able to skyrocket tesla into one of the most valuable
companies in the world overtaking every other car company by a long shot in just a few years and
this company was weird it wasn't obeying all the rules like there was almost no official marketing
campaign and elon decided to make all of his technology open source the patents were not
copyrighted anyone could see them and use them with the hope that the market for electric vehicles
would take off and that the world would more quickly move away from the use of fossil fuels which
would ultimately benefit tesla so if somebody comes and makes a better electric car than than tesla and
it's it's so much better than ours that we can't sell our cars and and we go bankrupt i still think
that's a good thing for the world these were bold crazy moves but they were totally working meanwhile
elon's space company was about to go out of business for spacex the first three launches failed
just barely able to scrape together enough parts and money to do the the fourth launch and then after
six years and six months of stress and intensity elon's dreams of going to space started to come
i'm going to explain a little bit more about how he did all of this but the big deal about spacex is
that they created a reusable rocket every other rocket is disposable you can only use it once and
it's very expensive but elon proved that you could use a rocket and safely land it back down onto
the surface of earth and then use it again soon spacex would be carrying nasa astronauts and supplies
to the international space station launching military satellites into space for the pentagon
launching dozens of satellites up into space for commercial use and even launching the first ever
private space flight for tourism space travel was officially reinvented i think we're at the
dawn of a new era and it's a reason for people to be excited and inspired to be human okay but
what's crazy is that during all of this elon is also launching a bunch of other companies
like the boring company which is trying to revolutionize traffic and transportation by
building smarter tunnels oh my god it just hit me that it's boring like boring into the side of a
mountain oh my god that just that just hit me right now this company also turned into like a blank canvas
for elon musk to play out all of his childish silly ideas like selling a flamethrower or this perfume that
smells like singed human hair and yes musk uses his businesses as kind of a way to troll humanity while
also trying to save humanity it's this behavior that a lot of people find refreshing and ends up
getting a lot of attention and becoming a marketing tool for all of his companies he starts building
neural link which is designing a way for humans to control computers with their brains which is
already having some initial successes and now that elon's company can easily go to space he starts
sending up these small satellites 6 000 of them that are orbiting the earth and he starts providing
internet to remote places arguably changing the course of the war in ukraine by providing ukrainian
soldiers with internet during the initial invasion from russia though that's gotten more complicated in
recent months as russian soldiers have started to use starlink and it's a whole other rabbit hole
okay but we're not done yet with elon's companies he also co-founded open ai way back in 2015 who went
on to make chat gpt he later left the company over disagreements and then has recently started his own
ai company called you guessed it x ai yes the guy loves the letter x it's literally the name of several
of his companies and one of his children each one of these ventures points back to elon's childish
idealism this grand vision of testing the limits of what humans can do by pushing our understanding
of physics and working together to do crazy amazing things but then after building all of these companies
that are focused on pushing the physical limits of human potential elon in recent years has set his sights
on reshaping another industry
tonight the richest man in the world is hunting for more put in an offer of almost 44 billion dollars
to buy twitter all of twitter is this all a troll or is this very real
elon musk has been portrayed as both a reckless unethical billionaire as well as a visionary who is
changing the world for the better and what you think about him probably comes from what you read
about him and what you read about him was probably served to you by an algorithm this is how our media
landscape works these days and it's getting us deeper and deeper into trouble which is a major theme
in this video but it's also in line with the sponsor of today's video which is ground news ground news is
a platform that i've been using to navigate this problem to find a balanced view where i can see
both sides of a news story ground news aggregates tens of thousands of news articles from around the
world into one place and then allows you to critically examine how that news is being covered here's a
recent story that on the left you can see from the los angeles times that engineers sue elon musk and
spacex saying that the company mirrored his juvenile crude x posts while on the right you've
got the new york post saying that elon musk was sued by fired engineers alleging elon musk allowed
pervasive sexist culture these headlines have subtle bias in them like the left-leaning headline suggests
that musk's personal behavior was directly responsible while the right-leaning headline emphasizes that
they were fired employees and that there was an alleged sexist culture softening any kind of
blame towards musk and his company this is really subtle stuff that's hard to pay attention to if
you're just scrolling your algorithm ground news emphasizes and highlights these biases and allows
you to be more critical as a news consumer not only do they show this bias distribution but they also
have a tool that rates how factual an article is and my favorite they have this blind spot detector
that pays attention to the articles that you tend to read and presents you with stuff that might be
outside of your comfort zone but that you probably need to see to be a balanced news consumer this is
a really cool tool i'm very glad they exist i'm really glad they're sponsoring today's video if you
want to try this out for yourself go to groundnews.com johnnyharris where you'll get 40 off the vantage plan
which is unlimited access to all of these features i use ground news i think it's really important in
today's media landscape i'm grateful that they sponsored today's video with that let's dive back
into the story of elon musk tonight the richest man in the world is hunting for more okay so we're
getting into this why did elon buy twitter what can we learn from it before we do that i want to tell
you a little bit about what i learned about elon musk as a leader after talking to people who have
worked with him people who have worked under him there's a few key lessons that i've taken away from
all of these conversations we've had with these people and doing research on him i will not be
quoting them directly because most of them asked to remain anonymous the first thing i heard over and
over again is how obsessed elon musk is with the details of what his companies are building i think
people think like i'm a business guy or something like that engineering that's like 80 percent more of
my time one source i talked to who worked closely with musk estimates that he spends 90 of his time
in technical details with a whiteboard out looking at code with engineers and programmers solving very
specific details in meetings that sometimes go into the middle of the night and this gets to our second
takeaway which is that elon questions everything and i mean everything you can see this really clearly
when he was building spacex it was tough going there in the beginning because i'd never built
anything physical i mean i'd built like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but
i never had a company that built anything physical elon's original idea for spacex was to buy
russian rockets that had been decommissioned and to rebuild them more efficiently i can tell you it was
very weird going to the russian rocket forces and saying i'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets
they thought i was crazy but but i did have money he went to russia and quickly discovered that the
price that governments pay for rockets is astronomical it felt absurd on the flight home
elon makes this list of every component he can think of needed to build a rocket and then he put
in the estimated price for just the materials and the components what he found is that the prices that
they were quoting him for these rocket parts were highly inflated he interrogated every single cost
associated with rockets and started to make plans on how his team could find a much cheaper way to build
them he did this over and over and over until soon his team was manufacturing 70 percent of all of
the rocket components for spacex and saving millions of dollars i heard story after story like this elon
showing up talking to some low-level engineer working on some very specific problem and interrogating it
until he found the most efficient answer oh and this wasn't about him being collaborative or inclusive
of his employees this is about him stress testing every single assumption pushing every single thing
to the limit so that he can find the most efficient way to build something this also makes working for
elon incredibly stressful he'll show up he'll question everything and then he'll tell people that
a six-month timeline needs to be condensed down into 90 days everyone's jaw drops they say it's impossible
and he says it has to be possible and then everyone makes it happen which gets me to number four the
people around him musk's ruthless idealism and vision for the future has attracted a lot of really
talented people who bring these dreams to life these people have rallied around his mission to reinvent
transportation or take humans to mars they're the ones who make it happen with unprecedented speed and
efficiency these four things are really his superpowers they are the ingredients that have
allowed him to reinvent entire industries but this isn't the full picture everyone i talk to includes
the fact that elon can be a total and is a lot of the time hate me like me or indifference do you want
the best car or do you not want the best car he is abrupt he is blunt and he puts basically no effort
into making you like him no i am not the evil i just misunderstood
one irony i kept hearing is that musk cares so much about humanity but he doesn't really care about humans
okay so i'm the father of an 11 year old who is autistic and i myself identify as being on some
part of the spectrum and so listening to hours of musk i see moments that to most people might
look like him being mean-hearted and arrogant and extreme and even cruel but to me feel more like him
being unaware or perhaps unwilling to play by the rules of social norms okay but and because my son
is probably watching this i need to make one thing crystal clear that there is a line here musk's
behavior especially recently can quickly cross into malicious temperamental mean-hearted and harmful
behavior that goes well beyond anything that can be justified or explained by neurodivergence into
something that looks a lot more like aggressive bullying coercion unethical business practices
there's almost a demon mode of elon musk where he turns really dark and that can be very problematic
especially when it came to acquiring twitter my point is that there's some empathy that is warranted
here it can be a blurry line but musk very clearly crosses that line something we'll talk about
more in a little bit but for now let's get back to our list these five things that are the big
takeaways on how musk operates and how he's built his empire and let's look at where this got him by
the early 2020s his four big companies had grown rapidly to become worth billions tesla reaching a
trillion dollar valuation one of most valuable companies on earth revolutionizing the car industry
and by january 2021 these successes has skyrocketed musk to become the world's richest man according to
forbes billionaire tracker but don't be fooled for musk this actually isn't an ideal situation musk's
biographer walter isaacson wrote this amazing book that details all of this private communication that
really gives us an inside look into the psychology of musk during this time and he documents this
conversation between siobhan zilis the director of operations at one of his companies and the mother of
a set of elon's twins and elon in a text that read you don't have to be in a state of war all the time
or is that where you find greater comfort when you're in periods of war and he replies that it's
a part of his default setting zilis then tells isaacson that it was like he was winning the simulation
and now he felt at a loss at what to do extended periods of calm were unnerving for him
the guy is addicted to conflict and crisis and tension and drama and being the world's richest
man with all these successes was uncomfortable he needed a new storm to throw himself into
and so he chose the storm of all storms
at the end of 2022 he buys twitter for 44 billion dollars in his offer letter he tells us why he's doing
it he believes that twitter has the potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe
and that free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy
and right away musk applies his playbook to the company sending out a midnight email telling
the thousands of employees that there's going to be a new twitter culture that is quote extremely
hardcore long hours high intensity and tells anyone who wants to stay to fill out this form
or be fired thousands of twitter employees are being laid off locked out of their work email
accounts twitter has fired half of its seven and a half thousand staff we called it the twitter hunger
games
i thought a lot about how to talk about musk's foray into twitter because it is in the news
right now it is shaping the way that we receive and talk about information and there's a lot of hot
takes out there what i decided to do here is to try to give the most earnest understanding as to
musk's motives why did he do this what does he want from it and what is he doing to reshape twitter
around this vision what was it ultimately that led you to make the decision to do it uh somewhat
melodramatic but i was worried about that that it was having a corrosive effect on civilization
so first and foremost free speech is like the thing he says over and over free speech free speech
free speech is the only way that humans are going to thrive and because musk's main mission is the
advancement of human civilization he must buy twitter and make it the free speech platform
the platform where we have perhaps the most important conversations in the world he says this
over and over like in this tweet where he says this is a battle for the future of civilization if free
speech is lost even in america tyranny is all that lies ahead so that's number one on what he says his
motives are i think part of it is that it's where it's where it was located which is uh you know
downtown san francisco the next pillar of musk's reasoning has to do with the city of san francisco
is there a place that's more far left than san francisco bookly twitter's headquarters is located
right here in downtown san francisco and for musk that's a big problem it was an accidental far left
information weapon that was then harnessed by the far left who could not themselves create the
weapon but happened to be co-located where the technologists were okay so let me get this straight
musk believes that twitter being in the heart of a liberal city means that the engineers and leaders
deciding what gets elevated and suppressed on twitter are infected with the politics of the liberal city and
so they're more likely to elevate their ideology a megaphone an information weapon that's his
argument i have a couple issues with the argument and its logical underpinning but again this is about
what elon musk says and as his motivations for buying twitter and number three the government is
censoring twitter and twitter is letting them twitter was simply um an arm of the government you know it's
a state publication is the way to think of old twitter it's a state publication all right this is
our list we're gonna get to each of these and like try to understand them all but like is anyone
else wondering what happened here it feels like the story went from quirky visionary engineer uses his
brilliant unorthodox socially immature tactics and obsessions to accomplish unprecedented engineering
feats to said quirky engineer suddenly dedicates his brilliant mind away from physics and towards
social media because he believes that there's a deep state conspiracy between san francisco technologists
infected with liberal bias and they're censoring government overlords and he is going to fix it
what happened i actually never got to the bottom of that and um i don't think anyone has that's
actually been a central question that was never answered for me during this reporting we do know this
pivot happened sometime in 2020. why did musk shift to obsessing over this the answer to that probably
lies somewhere in elon musk's brain and it is not ethical or useful for me to try to opine on his
mental health or what is going on in his brain so let's stick to the facts here is the logical framework
that elon musk used to buy twitter this is what he wants to do with it is fix this let's see what happens
next so after firing most of the employees and changing the name to his favorite letter he gets
to work on free speech he lets big accounts that were previously banned back onto the platform
including former president donald trump comedian kathy griffin lawmaker marjorie taylor green jordan
peterson within a few months he posts this tweet around the super bowl and he notices that this tweet
gets less engagement than the tweet by president joe biden elon does not like this he calls an urgent
meeting and tasks 80 engineers to quickly rebuild a version of the algorithm that will allow his
tweets to be artificially boosted by a factor of a thousand i was kind of skeptical on how sensational
it was reported but through my conversations confirmed that this actually went down like the
old twitter was not built to artificially boost one account and elon the free speech guy was like
i need you to boost my account because it's not getting as much attention as the president
and the 80 engineers did so a few months after buying the company elon now has super algorithmic
power and he uses it to start to amplify certain people so i know what you're thinking johnny you just
disagree with these people and so you think that it's bad that elon let them on but really free
speeches about letting everyone talk yes absolutely that is true and yet elon uses an artificially
amplified voice to prop up a very specific type of voice on twitter to amplify ideas extreme ideas
harmful ideas not just to liberals in san francisco but ideas that we as humanity recognize are bad ideas
and now someone with a massive megaphone has control on how big those ideas can get even
bill maher the elon fanboy there's a very few people who actually make change happen you are one
of those people even he could not understand why elon was doing this i understand why you wanted to
like have a platform where you have free speech but like why then embrace the worst people on it
and then elon isn't totally consistent about this like in the case of alex jones who spreads horrendous
conspiracies and misinformation to a lot of people when asked why elon didn't let him go back onto twitter
he said no saying that he had no mercy for anyone who would use the death of children for gain politics
or fame he did eventually reinstate alex jones after running a poll but you start to see that he'll
reinstate anyone unless he personally takes issue with their views or what they said what's puzzling to me is that
this isn't free speech absolutism it's not say anything you want musk's new twitter then starts
banning and suppressing substack links substack the place where independent journalists write musk made
the change where you can't comment or like on anything that has a substack article and you can't
embed tweets in your substack article that doesn't feel like free speech to me musk then decides that the
word cisgender is a slur on twitter and threatens to ban people who use it too much is that free
speech he then starts banning journalists who criticize him though he did reinstate a few of
them after a vote and then starts suing media watchdog organizations like the center for countering
digital hate trying to silence them for criticizing the new twitter musk of course lost with the verdict
coming out saying that this lawsuit was basically about trying to silence criticism and deter others
from criticizing his company he's someone who is willing to use his enormous wealth and power to
silence people like this is such clear anti-free speech behavior when twitter users organized a protest
against making users pay for a blue check mark he banned that account and this is what's so mind-bending
like i swear he's trolling us here he says that he's obsessed with free speech but then immediately
after taking it over twitter he demonstrates an extreme hypocrisy for that very point and i secretly
think he's doing that so that we are talking about it right now i don't think it was ever about free
speech i also think that when he posts political propaganda ads like this conspiracy video that says that
democrats are letting immigrants in to turn america into single-party rule and has almost a hundred
million views i think he's doing that not because he agrees with this factless piece of propaganda
but because he loves to rile people up though maybe he does agree with it i don't know either way
he has built a platform that gives him the biggest megaphone and suppresses people that criticize him
that is not free speech okay but let's move on because free speech was just one of his three major motives
what about this argument that twitter is infected with liberal ideology because it is based in san
francisco luckily we have data this was a great study very thorough algorithmic amplification of
politics on twitter it's a study from before elon took over they conducted a long-running massive scale
randomized experiment where they looked at a huge number of tweets from seven countries and they found
that in six out of the seven countries including the united states that quote the mainstream political
right enjoys a higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left they saw this
over and over oh and also a really interesting side note here is that they found that twitter
actually doesn't amplify far left or far right political groups more than moderate ones which is a
myth that i believed until i read this study but the whole point is that old twitter did not have a liberal
bias if anything it had a conservative bias this study is very robust proof of that despite elon's
theory that twitter being in san francisco infected it with a liberal bias go to the sources and read the
study for yourself if you want to poke into it if there's anything wrong with it that i'm missing
please tell me but it seems like pretty damn solid proof to me okay but what about the last critique
and this is a big one musk believed that twitter was being censored by governments and twitter was letting
them do this and guess what that is actually true upon taking over twitter musk cracked into all of the
internal communications and found a bunch of emails that showed how twitter had banned and suppressed
information that it deemed harmful and dangerous but that they did so sometimes with a political bias
you can see things like biden's team asking twitter to review these tweets that they didn't like
yes governments around the world can ask twitter to take things down in their country that they
think are breaking the law or that are harmful to national security and this happened on both sides
the trump white house asked twitter to take things down as well but this reporting did reveal what
looked like a lot of left-leaning bias in censoring certain highly sensitive content that would be
damaging to the left the big example of this was this new york post article about hunter biden's laptop
twitter severely censored this not even letting people dm the link to each other and making up a
thin justification for it later now content moderation deciding what is harmful and what
should be censored and what shouldn't is a really difficult task but for a lot of people including
myself this crossed a line this was not okay though i have to say that hunter biden new york post
article was the most sort of egregious one a lot of the other stuff in the twitter files
was not nearly as black and white much more nuanced much more complicated the point is there
should be transparency here and i agree with musk on that okay but this is once again where we find some
strange paradox that doesn't make any sense which is that since musk took over government censorship
on twitter has gone up twitter suspended multiple journalists from prominent outlets including the
washington post the new york times and cnn tonight a number of high profile journalists have been silenced
here are the number of takedown requests that governments around the world made to twitter
in the six months before musk took over and these are the ones that twitter complied with
twitter would fully comply with the government's censorship request about half of the time the other
half the time they'd say no in the six months after musk the number of requests went up probably
because musk got rid of a lot of the automatic moderation but look musk's twitter now says yes to
government censorship over 80 percent of the time way more than the old twitter wait what and look
the kind of stuff that musk is allowing to be censored on the platform is really sensitive stuff
for free speech like take turkey for example there was a turkish election last year the president of
turkey himself a massive user of state censorship pressured twitter to block the accounts of a few people
he didn't like a kurdish businessman an investigative journalists both of them vocal critics of the
president like this is like clear black and white political censorship in an election year like make
the guy who is criticizing me go away and guess what musk's twitter did it they said yes they banned the
accounts and then said we didn't have a choice they were gonna shut down all of twitter so we had to do
it and then they patted themselves on the back about how they were still trying to fight it and they're
doing so much for battling government censorship and transparency on the platform but guess what
they did have a choice this same kind of thing happened before musk ever came in and twitter fought
back in a previous turkish election the government tried to do the same thing censor posts about
corruption within the turkish government they asked twitter to take these down and twitter said
no they fired back that political speech is among the most important speech especially when it
concerns matters of possible corruption so turkey shut down twitter it was down for a couple of weeks
while they battled it out in court and the turkish government lost indeed they lost because they were
trying to censor political speech and twitter fought back there's even more recent examples like wikipedia
or wokipedia as elan calls it refusing to comply with the turkish government's censorship requests
getting completely shut down for almost three years only to have it be overturned in turkish courts
a major win for free speech in turkey which is something that's in short supply lately
so like wikipedia twitter can do this they can say no to the turkish government if they're actually
crusaders for free speech and if they're actually against government censorship they would have said no in
2023 musk's twitter did this in india too when the indian government asked twitter to censor a bunch
of journalists including an entire bbc bureau and a documentary that was critical of the government
and the president and twitter complied elon where is your conviction for free speech where is your hate
for government censorship in moments like this where it really really matters but for elon musk he's got
a lot of other things he needs to think about he needs to think about the market for teslas who might
be buying his satellites or rockets he needs to be thinking about where tesla factories might be set
up the market for his electric cars this is a conflict of interest that gets in the way of his
idealistic vision for free speech and his hate for government censorship twitter used to have a page
where they would publish in detail why they would take down any content they took down at the request of
the government and there's this research lab at harvard that would aggregate all of this for the public
when our story producer alex went to go look for these government requests from turkey and india
she found that they no longer were there this page had gone quiet so she reached out to the harvard
lab and got this response twitter stopped sharing this data starting in april 2023 no more
transparency on government censorship it looks like it's down to the whims of one super rich dude that is
not free speech that is the antithesis of what this guy said he was going to build so no i don't think
elon musk is earnest about these three things that he said were his motive for buying twitter in fact
after looking into all of this i'm having a hard time figuring out what elon is earnest about at all
other than his belief that humans have the potential to do amazing things i do believe that in all of
this that is the one thing that has stayed consistent but how he's pursuing that goal and that vision in
recent years is baffling confusing and in my mind quite harmful to our society twitter seems much more
like a platform where he can bully the people he doesn't like he can feed his addiction to crisis and
controversy while also showing a childish hypocrisy in his principles and values but unlike his other
ventures which you can tell when they're successful because they're physics the rocket either goes up into
space or it doesn't the car drives or it doesn't this new venture doesn't have a physical feedback loop
that tells him if it's doing good or working instead he's playing with the delicate precarious nature of
information in the internet age something that is already in crisis and now is being chipped away
at by one rich dude who gets off on crisis and what blows my mind most is that in the process of all of
this musk is undermining his own dream his own vision this is a sentiment i heard from the employees
and colleagues of elon musk they felt betrayed like this man pushed them to think differently to do things
that seemed impossible all in the name of this grand vision of what humanity could be what we could do as
a civilization and yet in recent years he seems to be sabotaging that very vision alienating the people
and customers that he needs to bring this vision to life in my mind elon has exchanged that vision
for controversy and division that forces all of us to talk about it here we are talking about it talking
about him i think a part of him loves that or needs that and yet after all of this defenders of elon will
continue to argue that only someone like this could be the one to change the world to anyone i've offended
i just want to say i reinvented electric cars and i'm sending people to mars in a rocket ship
did you think i was also going to be a chill normal dude
and yeah i get that the people who change the world aren't normal and orthodox
they're not nice but i don't accept this way of thinking about musk today maybe a couple years ago
but in recent years musk has shown it's his addiction to crisis and attention that is having
a corrosive effect on our society validating and glorifying ways of acting that rewards the worst
parts of us and instead of saving civilization driving us further apart
