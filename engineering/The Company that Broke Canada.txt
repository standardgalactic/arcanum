big thank you to nebula for sponsoring this video this is john roth he's the ceo of a company called
nortel he's about to be smug deservingly so uh let's move on to lucent uh the big competitor
sells at the border um what do they do better than you uh not much um pretty good at marketing
um but if you look at the results we grew 43 percent in the carrier space in the u.s last
year well in this last quarter i think that's double their numbers at the time of this clip
nortel was the second highest canadian company on the global fortune 500 list at rank 216. but he
doesn't plan on stopping there just one year from now nortel will be the ninth most valuable company
in the entire world 75 of north america's backbone internet traffic travels through his company's
networks an achievement that will earn him the title of canadian ceo of the year this is also
john roth or rather it's comedian impersonating john roth not particularly well mind you there's no
genuine attempt at his voice and the mannerisms are way too high energy and yet the audience is eating it
up now final question mr roth where will nortel be say a year from now uh linda nortel is strong i
guarantee investors i will continue to generate profits for them now if you'll excuse me i have
to get back to work spare some change
in this moment however brief it was john roth was maybe the most hated man in canada
nortel had been the most widely held stock in the country and it had just cost them their pensions
nortel had broken an entire country's economy how did it happen three words it's ancient history
so here's a statement the telephone was invented in canada it's a statement that could be true so
long as you don't look too hard at the several footnotes that are necessary to justify it but
let's go ahead and do that alexander graham bell was a scottish immigrant who moved to canada with
his parents in 1870. later on he got a job as a teacher and began experimenting with sending voices
over metal wires as electrical signals over the years he would develop this idea with his partner
watson and in 1876 bell said his famous words watson come here i need you over a working telephone
prototype in boston the canadian claim to the telephone is frankly very silly bell supposedly
wrote about the underlying mechanism of a telephone at his parents home in branford ontario but he
wouldn't get a working prototype for another two years you can't even really argue it based on
citizenship either because bell was never technically a canadian but a self-identified
scotsman who was actively applying to become an american of course this isn't even the biggest
elephant in the room bell was beaten to the invention of the telephone by at least one person
maybe more there's antonio meucci whose telephone prototype predates bells by almost a decade his lawsuit
against bell was headed to the supreme court until he died in 1889 alicia gray famously submitted a
patent on the exact same day as bell there are disputes over the exact timeline here but it's a
bit of a moot point because neither man had made a functioning prototype yet bell did get one working
a week later but the design of his receiver had been altered becoming suspiciously similar to the one
in gray's design info he shouldn't have known about unless he had somehow seen gray's application hmm as
you're going to see many times in this story the history of industry is not about the first to
invent but the first to market bell got the patent for the telephone because he hired a better lawyer
simple as that the most lucrative patent in history led to a factory the factory led to a company and
the company became a behemoth through decades of aggressive expansion brutal boardroom takeovers
underhanded back alley sabotage and the limitless funding of jp morgan that single patent evolved into the
most ruthless corporation in american history at&t a terrifying beast that gobbled up hundreds of
independent phone companies a monopoly that at its peak once controlled 82 percent of america's
telephone lines footnotes or not the history of the telephone is an american one but why then have i
seen this statement at least in part claimed by some canadian sources why is this a hill that some
canadians seem willing to die on because the canadian identity if there is such a thing is one
defined in opposition to the united states if you want to be dramatic and i do sometimes canada is
just a slightly more autonomous 51st state both countries descend from a combination of english and
french colonies built on territories stolen from its indigenous inhabitants lands divided by a border so
arbitrary most of it is literally just the 49th parallel why some of the colonies rebelled against
the british and why others stayed loyal came down to language religion local economies and proximity to
the british empire the settlers in these two colonies always had a lot in common and due to their
geographic proximity there has always existed an uncommonly close relationship it just so happens
that that relationship is more than a little lopsided pierre trudeau one of our more outspoken prime
ministers summed it up like this living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no
matter how friendly and even tempered is the beast if i can call it that one is affected by every twitch
and grunt america is simply a much older and densely populated nation america's first colonists
arrived almost two centuries earlier than the bulk of canada's and the americans had gone and finished
their civil war before modern canada was even created in the 1860s couple that with a colder climate
and harsher terrain for almost the entire time the two countries have existed canada has had one
tenth the population and one tenth the economy of its southern neighbor even just california despite
having roughly the same population has an economy 50 percent larger ever since the war of 1812 ended in
a stalemate canada has never had to worry about being militarily annexed by the us instead canada has spent most
of its existence fending off another more indirect form of control economic subservience the company
that owns the majority of our newspapers is two-thirds owned by an american hedge fund most of
the media we consume is american and the basis of our economy is ripping natural resources out of the
ground shipping them off to america and then buying them back for twice the price in the form of fancy
toys we're america's biggest customer but they're not ours and that's a precarious position to be in
canada's first prime minister john a mcdonald had just returned to power in the election of 1878
canada was in the midst of a deep depression that was partially brought on by the americans cancelling
a trade agreement in the middle of their civil war mcdonald was keenly aware of the public's distrust
of american business and although behind closed doors he was in favor of free trade with the americans
he knew they would never sign a new agreement and so he used anti-american rhetoric to call the rival
liberal party quote veiled traders and managed to win both the 1878 and 1891 elections by stoking
fears of american annexation mcdonald's platform was called the national policy the centerpiece of
which was an aggressive import tax on all american products the tariff was designed to keep cheap
american products out of canada to promote a strong homegrown manufacturing industry the national
policy and anti-americanism dominated canada's political agenda for decades and a later attempt at a
free trade agreement similarly defeated the government of wilfrid laurier in 1911 where it
was once again painted as an act of treason however the national policy whose stated goal was to keep
canada british had arguably backfired it had only made canada more reliant on american industry take for
example at&t having secured the canadian patent for the telephone their original plan was to simply make
telephones in america and ship them up to canada the new tariffs made that a complete no-go so the
company hatched a plan they hired a former confederate ship captain sent him off to canada with a boatload
of money where he proceeded to execute a series of business moves so rapid that in just a few months
he owned almost all telephone lines in the entire country alongside this purchase was a single telephone
factory in montreal a necessary condition to retain the canadian patent parts would be shipped up from
the us assembled in canada completely negating the import tax this was the birth of the bell telephone
company of canada and how canada became a branch plant economy and as of 1895 that little montreal
branch plant was given a name northern electric and manufacturing limited we've got about a century to
go still but the family resemblance between these two names is clear northern made a bunch of stuff
fire alarms sleigh bells gramophones telegraphs kettles toasters lighters stoves washing machines
radios if it ran on electricity they could probably make it but their bread and butter was always
telephones although legally they were separate entities at&t was always in the background pulling
the strings of bell canada with its endless monopoly money western electric was cranking out telephone
tech like there was no tomorrow and northern electric got access to technology that no one
else did without having to do any r d they just took the designs that western gave them made their
tweaks and sold them to canadians sometimes the only thing that would change was the logo on the phone
always the branch plant never the brains this symbiotic relationship was just a microcosm of the
larger canadian economy even in the 1910s when at&t is forced to sell off its foreign holdings due to
antitrust reasons it's allowed to keep its stake in canada because the two countries were so
interlinked canada had spent its first 50 years relying on its commonwealth parent of great britain
but by the 1920s canada was now trading more with the us as productivity began to rise as america
modernized its factories canada's were quick to follow then out of nowhere the markets crashed
ushering in the great depression across north america the 1930s saw 80 percent of northern's employees
laid off and then it's world war ii yanking the country and the company out of its depression
northern becomes a dedicated supplier of military equipment for the government canada like the us
emerges from the war in a relatively prosperous position compared to europe northern now had a
backlog of nearly a hundred thousand telephone orders it had to fulfill dragged there by the us
canada had achieved the second highest adoption rate of phones per 100 people in the entire world
going from just 28 000 phones in 1895 to almost 1 million in 1942 and then suddenly the elephant
rolled over for years at&t had been accused of running a vertical monopoly by owning its manufacturer
western electric desperate to keep its prized possession at&t settles out of court and makes a trade
on two conditions the first is to stay out of the computer business considering that bell labs had just
invented the transistor they were really going to regret this one in about 10 years the second is
more relevant to our story at&t now had to offer the same licensing deal for its patents to anyone who
asked but because at&t owned bell canada and was sharing its patents with them for free that meant
that any other u.s company would be entitled to that same deal so rather than give away its patents for
free at&t said you know what canada is on its own the ceo of northern at the time described it like
this we are the child of wealthy parents this is the boot that kicked us out the door a canadian
subsidiary of a u.s company lives a very comfortable life this is the tragedy of canada we've made a
virtue of imitation but he also said this i'm confident history will say this is the best thing
that ever happened to us would you believe me that in a little more than half a century
the mouse would be trying to eat the elephant
in the 1950s the canadian government contracted the company av row to build a stealth interceptor jet
called the avro arrow it was widely considered to be one of if not the best in its class in the world
costing around 2.2 billion canadian dollars in today's money the arrow had been the single most
expensive r d project in canadian history and it put canada on the map in the global aerospace
industry but there was no one to sell it to the american and the british militaries wanted to
produce their own jets and in fact america turned around and said hey why don't you buy our jets
instead in the most controversial move of his career prime minister john dieffenbaker fell in line
with american defense policy he cancelled the project ordered all prototypes destroyed and
left 14 000 canadians unemployed although you can argue over the merits of the avro arrow itself the
real failure here was that the government refused to support a transition for the facility it had
already spent millions on a facility that could have been converted to civilian aircraft and given
canada its own equivalent to boeing it's ironic that dieffenbaker is remembered for capitulating to
american influence just days before the election that made him prime minister dieffenbaker had
declared that if the liberals were re-elected quote canada will become a virtual 49th economic state
in the american union you see anti-americanism never truly disappears in canada but rather it comes in
waves the stretch of time bookended by the two world wars was a notable period of cooperation
between the two nations but now in the era of the cold war canadians were becoming uncomfortable with
the idea that they were simply a sidekick to the us 1956 saw the government release the results of
the gordon commission an economic panel which had spent the last year researching the rapid americanization
of canada first there was culture by the mid-1950s 80 of magazine sales were from american brands
canadian newspapers were still canadian owned but any international coverage was usually borrowed from
american papers the canadian film industry was almost entirely non-existent even if we did have films to
show film distribution was owned entirely by hollywood and they had no interest in showing
canadian films even our education system tended to be biased towards america there's a particularly
infamous textbook on canadian politics that for some reason had abraham lincoln on the cover the real
heart of the issue though was economic in 1967 58 of canada's manufacturing industry was owned by
firms whose headquarters were outside of canada and 80 of that fraction was american and the more
specialized you got the higher the fraction went transport electronics chemicals all extremely
american the worst by far was cars can you name a single canadian car brand you can't because there
are none left natural resources which had formed the bedrock of canada's economy for decades were lining
american pocketbooks pulp and paper smelting mining and oil and gas alberta's pride and joy was nearly
two-thirds owned by americans this was such a touchy subject that there was once a debate in parliament
over whether to allow an american company to build an interprovincial oil pipeline the debate got so
heated three mps were hospitalized and one died of a heart attack canada was a branch plant economy and
that was scaring people all across the political spectrum on the left wing you had labor organizers
who feared that the us would simply set up branch plants in canada extract natural resources and
then ship them back down south where americans would get to reap the benefits from any newly
created manufacturing jobs on the right wing the complaints tended to focus on how canada should
instead be re-establishing ties with britain and the monarchy and that a loss of economic power to
the americans could eventually lead to a loss of political independence but between these differing
sides there was one common shared concern american technology was a crutch canada had a huge
technological deficit that's one of the key features of a branch plant economy branch plants
tend to supply jobs that require less training like resource extraction or assembly lines jobs that are
easily moved elsewhere if the cost of labor gets too high jobs like finance marketing and critically
r d are best kept centralized in the home country in 1959 if you looked at dollars per capita spent
on r d in the private sector the us was spending almost four times as much as canada here's an even
more shocking stat a government commission in the mid-60s looked at every patent registered in canada
95 of them were held by someone outside the country and two-thirds of that number was in the us
that meant the canadian industry had to spend millions each year licensing out patents from
americans or costly imports of high-tech equipment case in point northern electric in 1956 the year that
at&t had to divest itself northern only made one percent of its revenue from its own designs all the rest
were american for over 60 years northern operated mostly on autopilot assembling american parts using american
blueprints the company atmosphere was described as sleepy and complacent the ceo at the time joked
that you could only get fired for quote screwing the boss's daughter and then only if it was on
company premises belle canada was so unsure of northern that there were multiple times where
they considered only two options sell it or shut it down but there was a third option break the branch
plant cycle make a canadian company self-sufficient and as we've just seen the political climate at home
had never been more supportive it's not that northern lacked smart employees they just hadn't
been in charge of the decision making until now in fact northern's engineers were likely some of the
most capable in the entire country because of their prior connections to at&t and bell labs the
engineers at northern electric were some of the first outside america to be able to reverse engineer
and learn about the transistor by the end of the 1960s they were the single largest microchip supplier
in canada they helped build the world's largest microwave comm system the trans canada skyway and
they managed to develop an antenna designed to track satellites but the 60s were still a slow period
for northern when they began the decade only one percent of their products were canadian designs
by 1969 they had only managed to increase that number to six percent the switch over was going too
slowly the only way to get ahead would be to give canada its own bell labs b n r bell
northern research founded in ottawa in 1971 it mimicked bell labs in every way it could there
was a bounty of 500 for every patent you filed the atmosphere was like that of a university campus
and there was even a signature color purple that the employees rallied behind even its first president
donald chisholm had been poached from the real bell labs look i'm going to be candid for a second here
bnr is the reason i live in the city that i do my grandfather was one of the founding engineers
hired to work there and he moved my dad's family from montreal all the way to ottawa bnr is not a
name most of you would have heard of and it sadly doesn't have any nobel prizes but so much of the
modern communications landscape the technology that powers the video you're watching right now
was invented in ottawa bnr was about to gamble everything to leapfrog bell labs telephone switches
are the most basic building block of a telephone network back in the days of grand bell they were
originally just sold in pairs phone a and phone b and you put them wherever you needed with a giant
wire running between them obviously that's not super scalable so people decided to designate one
building in town as an exchange where human operators would physically move wires around to
connect different phone lines this too was phased out in favor of electromechanical contraptions
that were the size of entire rooms this finally gave way to fully electronic switches which had
fewer moving parts were much less noisy and overall more reliable this was the state of telephone
technology as the 60s turned into the 70s telephone calls had been analog for as long as they had
existed an electronic wave with smooth curves but since the advent of the transistor electronic signals
could now be sent in binary enough ones and zeros could encode any analog signal with enough precision
that barely any information would be lost that was how computers operated through massive processors
crunching thousands of bits and bytes people realized fairly quickly that if you could combine
phones with computers the possibilities would be endless costs would go down reliability would go up
you could send multiple phone conversations over the same wire signal degradation and noise over long
distances was far easier to correct you could also expand into what we now consider basic features
like call forwarding or a busy line notification and maybe in the far future you would even use phone
lines to send data between two computers can you imagine that sending something other than voice over
telephone lines that'd be like some kind of inter network i don't know maybe there's a better name for that
the problem with this idea is that digital signals can't talk to analog signals at least not directly
you need to convert them using a codec bell labs had figured this out in 1963 but the process was so
complicated and expensive that it was only worthwhile to do for giant long distance cables and the
connections between huge central offices there was still no fully digital switch at the local level
there was a full-on race between at least seven countries to break this digital barrier and canada
was way in last when it jumped in with bnr so how did canada come from behind and win it all
it's because at&t had become too complacent despite having a huge technological head start
at&t was telling customers that digital switching wouldn't be available for several more years
see this is the inherent contradiction of monopolies their endless resources allow them to develop the best
technology and offer the best service but because they have such a stranglehold on the market they
sometimes stifle innovations that threaten their business model case in point answering machines
bell labs invented the technology to record phone calls sometime in the 1940s but at&t suffocated it
worried that people would stop using phones for business if they knew they could be recorded
answering machines wouldn't catch on until the 1970s it was the same with cell phones bell labs first
demonstrated a wireless phone in the 1970s but again at&t refused to develop it why would they
create a competing type of phone that didn't use the billions of dollars worth of infrastructure
they had taken decades to establish cell phones wouldn't catch on until the 1990s it was the same
thing with digital switching at&t would be required to update its entire technical ecosystem at a huge
cost not to mention they'd be making their older switches completely redundant this was an attitude
echoed by some executives within bell canada they were certain that a digital switch would kill sales
of their just released sp1 model but as future ceo john roth would later say if you're going to be
cannibalized it's best to be cannibalized by yourself in 1976 northern unveiled their newest switch
the sl1 at a trade show they called digital world which they hosted at none other than disney world
the timing was everything by committing when everyone else was too hesitant they had caught the rest of the
industry by surprise because it was the only one of its kind for nearly two years the sl1 became the
best-selling switch in the world after that the size of the switches just kept increasing the sl1
became the sl10 then the dms10 then the dms100 northern could handle up to a hundred thousand
phone calls through just a single switch last time we checked in northern made just six percent of their
own designs by 1975 that was 50 percent and by 1977 they were up to 70. this was an unrecognizable
company from just two decades ago in fact this newfound success was worthy of a name change
northern electric was far too generic everything was electric these days how about northern telecom
it was also a perfect time to go public in 1973 they go live on the toronto stock exchange
and a couple years later they made it into the big leagues wall street during the 70s northern
had gone from having earnings of 5 million dollars to 111 million and the workforce grew to 33 000
people if northern was an american company it would have been ranked 160 on the fortune 500. northern's
ceo during this time was a man named john lob and there's a quote from him that has pretty much become
company folklore he would often go around asking employees what the company made hoping they'd take the
bait when they inevitably answered with switches he'd hit them with the real answer we don't make
switching god damn it we make money look i'm a sucker for unsubtle metaphors northern's first
president was a literal former sea captain for almost a hundred years northern was shielded from
the perils of the open market only ever sailing close to shore by going public on the stock market
this was northern setting out to sea taking a risk that a canadian company could go global
and lucky for them the hammer came crashing down at the perfect time
helping you stay on top of change today and tomorrow that's the power of networking
the breakup of at&t is the picture-perfect definition of hubris at&t was the biggest
corporation in the world it employed around 1 million americans and provided the cheapest and
for many decades the best phone service in the world for many americans they were the only company
you could get a telephone from and it did so through absolutely crushing business tactics although the
days of literal sabotage were in the past now it resorted to brutal boardroom takeovers political
lobbying and fighting tooth and nail to prevent third-party companies from tapping into its network
it had done all of this with the tacit approval of the u.s government which granted it the right to exist
as a regulated monopoly one that had an immense role in the u.s defense industry the maternalistic image
of ma bell however had been slowly deteriorating for decades for some people at&t was a brute a
bully whose arrogance had gone unchecked for far too long service quality had slipped in recent years
and yet phone bills continued to go up at&t finally overstepped when it tried to crush a new rival
and later attempted to ram a bill through congress a bill that once and for all would crown it the one
telephone company to rule them all this pissed off just the right people in the justice department
which initiated an excruciatingly slow and complex legal battle that played out over a decade and
four different presidents although it initially looked like at&t would walk away with just another
slap on the wrist to the horror of the executives they gradually realized that their behemoth wasn't
nearly as invincible as they thought it was the breakup agreement in january of 1982 is perhaps the
single most impactful and controversial event in the history of american industry unlike the 1956
settlement which saw at&t make a few small concessions this new ruling was a devastating
defeat and it left a massive power vacuum at&t had been desperate to keep western electric under its
control but in exchange they had to watch the rest of their empire be smashed into 22 pieces the local
phone companies the baby bells as they were called can now buy their equipment from anyone they wanted
and of those 22 baby bells northern snatched up 21. former vice chairman david vice said this when the
divestiture took place we found that our customers embraced us in a bloody bear hug they've been with
at&t and western electric all those years and had been taken for granted in just a couple years
northern rockets up to become the number two telecom company in north america right behind western
electric it's much bigger but now extremely depressed cousin previously northern had negotiated an
unspoken deal with at&t that they would stay out of their turf they would only sell to the independents
who despised at&t but now the big bad mob boss had been whacked the impact of this ruling is obvious
on northern's stock price you can see in 82 when it becomes clear that at&t is going to have to give in
that northern begins to slowly tick up by the time the breakup becomes official in 84 northern's stock
price is three times what it was it had broken the curse of the branch plant as of 82 northern
was officially making more money in the us market than in canada this was always bound to happen the
market in america is 10 times as big the real question was how much of it they could capture the
expansion was rapid northern began setting up plants in california texas georgia north carolina
soon there were 13 000 americans working for northern when it came to grand marketing gestures
nothing was too expensive northern charted a cruise ship the ss rotterdam filled with members of the
fortune 500 community and wined and dined them for days when an elaborate trade show in europe was
almost shut down due to concerns over poor ventilation northern paid to have an expensive hole
cut in the roof with the financial backing of bell canada behind them northern was unstoppable
which raises an interesting point why did at&t get broken up but bell canada was allowed to live on
bell canada although it tried very hard never quite maintained a true monopoly like at&t had managed to
down south although at the peak of its power in the early 1900s it had steadily lost ground ever since
in terms of sheer land mass the us and canada aren't that far off but the vast majority of canada is
extremely remote maintaining a presence in the less populated regions proved so costly that service was
often unreliable angering the locals in the maritimes bell itself had been pushed out by some
local rivals in the prairies the residents were so fed up with the poor service that the provincial
governments bought bell out and turned them into provincial utilities easily the second coolest
things the prairies have done for us after giving us universal healthcare and bc was so far away that
bell never even bothered to try and get a foothold on the west coast if bell canada had a monopoly it
was restricted to the windsor quebec city corridor the home of over half the population bell canada
had achieved the ideal size the goldilocks zone big enough to dominate the market but small enough that
the politicians left it alone the few attempts at cracking down on bell's monopoly fizzled out as
canada's regulatory agencies were undermined and overruled by the government and if i had to hazard a
guess i think pierre trudeau and his cabinet were happy to sit back and watch the american telephone
company implode so canada could pick up the scraps the canadian-american divide of the 50s continued to
surge into the 60s and 70s jfk hated dieffen baker for his flip-flopping over the q and missile crisis
lbj hated pearson's guts for not backing them in vietnam and then you had nixon and trudeau two men who
could not have been more different in both personality and politics whether it was because of trudeau's
open diplomacy with china and cuba or nixon abruptly announcing a 10 tariff with no warning the canadian
u.s relationship truly hit a low point in the 70s it was in this climate that trudeau's minority
government with a push from the left-wing ndp created fira the foreign investment review agency
was on paper at least a way to block foreign takeovers and screen foreign investment that
didn't bring quote a significant benefit to canadians fira was never very popular the right
wing called it overreaching the left wing called it toothless and the left wing of the left wing
were over in the corner chanting the words nationalization over and over trudeau himself
had not been much of an economic nationalist he'd been pushed into creating fira by a minority
parliament and by the 80s the liberals were desperately trying to woo back the private sector
pierre trudeau had served one of the longest tenures of a pm in the country's history and his
later years had been dominated by issues of national unity and an economic downturn the east-west divide
that had always existed continued to widen trudeau's nationalization of the oil industry had made him a
pariah in the oil rich west trudeau a long-time opponent of quebec's growing separatist movement
had become increasingly unpopular in the province after he pushed through a new constitution without
their approval and the practice known as the 60s scoop had continued well into the 1980s where
indigenous children were forcibly taken from their parents and placed up for adoption with white
families others were placed in residential schools where any and all semblance of indigenous language
culture and heritage were forcibly stamped out this was not a united country for a multitude of
reasons there were and still are millions of people living within canada's borders who do not
identify as canadian who do not identify with this flag if there had been a strong nationalist movement
in the 70s it had fractured into pieces by the 80s bell and northern were among the leading voices in
canadian capital that were demanding a changing of the guard high tech they said was the industry that
would yank canada out of its recession they wanted the government that would lower their taxes and
reduce trade barriers for expanding into the newly vulnerable u.s market they would get their wish
in brian mulrooney mulrooney and his tories delivered one of the most lopsided electoral
wins in canadian history he was cut from the same ideological cloth as ronald reagan and margaret
thatcher deregulation privatization and the free market 23 of canada's 61 crown corporations were
privatized under mulrooney fira which was already a rubber stamp machine at this point was dismantled
even further and renamed investment canada its oversight over new investment was completely eliminated
and its ability to block foreign takeovers was scaled back so much the act has only been invoked
a handful of times since mulrooney declared that canada was open for business he didn't see american
money as a threat he openly welcomed it as public polling around free trade began to shift he believed
that by adopting it as his party's key policy plank it would carry them through the next election
critically though he would never have considered it if not for his extremely close relationship with
ronald reagan reagan's advisors feared phone calls from canada because quote he could get the
president to do anything he wanted mulrooney was the only foreigner to speak at reagan's funeral
without this close relationship free trade between the two countries may never have been adopted
we've only seen small glimpses of it but the us has a long history of its own economic protectionism
several times in the past century and a half american tariffs have sent the canadian economy
spiraling when it pulled out of a trade deal in 1850 the smoot-holly tariffs during the great
depression the nixon shock of the 70s and most recently ronald reagan had been promoting a made
in america policy that threatened to block companies like northern from america altogether canadians
weren't necessarily afraid of free trade what they were afraid of was getting the short end of the
stick in negotiations with a country that many perceived as a bully this was the message of
liberal leader john turner he considered himself a proponent of free trade but not a bilateral
agreement directly with the us it's one thing to negotiate in the context of dozens of countries
coming together it's another to try and negotiate one-on-one with a country 10 times your size thanks
to tv ads like this one free trade became the defining issue of the 1988 federal election since we're talking
about this free trade agreement there's one line i'd like to change which line is that well this one here
it's just getting in the way just how much are we giving away in the moroni free trade deal
it also culminated in one of the most explosive moments ever to happen in a canadian political debate
i happen to believe that you've sold us out i happen to believe that once you mr turner just
just one second once any you do not you do not have a monopoly on patriotism and i resent the fact
that your implication that only you were a canadian i want to tell you that i come from a canadian family
and i love canada and that's why i did it we built a country east and west and north we build it on an
infrastructure that deliberately resisted the continental pressure of the united states
for 120 years we've done it with one signature of a pen you've reversed that thrown us into the
north-south influence of the united states with a duck and will reduce us really juice us i'm sure
to a colony of the united states because when the economic levers go the political independence is
sure to fall this moment resuscitated what many had been calling a dead campaign there had been
talks of replacing turner as leader mid-campaign but the liberals surged into first ultimately
turner's past record weighed him down and the tories would eventually clinch the election the free trade
agreement would be enacted soon after and that was that with the exception of a few staples like lumber
or dairy the playing field had been wiped clean it was time to get in the ring and start throwing some
punches northern's success in the 80s was dependent on entering the hostile american market after having
a pair of canadian ceos at the helm it became clear that northern needed a ceo with connections
in washington that's how they landed on edmund fitzgerald a former u.s marine part owner of the
milwaukee brewers baseball team and the descendant of a wealthy wisconsin shipping family fitzgerald was
perfect for the job as a republican with extensive lobbying experience he rallied hard in washington
against new bills that threatened northern's southward expansion although still canadian
northern spoke with a fluent american accent when it needed to the sales numbers spoke for
themselves but the symbolic victories also helped the telephone switches in the white house which
had previously belonged to at&t were now made by northern although america was the main target of
northern's expansion the 80s was the decade that northern went global they expanded into europe the
caribbean the entire pacific rim they truly made history in japan becoming the first ever non-japanese
company to install a telephone switch there and in 1987 northern had an almost perfect
marketing moment to fall right into their lap an earthquake hits just outside of tokyo all the
switches in the building break as their mechanical parts are torn off the only exception was northern's
dms-10 which was fully digital the trend of american ceos continued as edmund fitzgerald sought out a
successor he chose paul stern a former ibm exec who he had met while serving on a reagan's telecom
committee one former vp described paul stern as quote arguably the most bloated ego of anyone i've
ever met he insisted on being referred to as dr stern which is one of those things that he can
technically do but is also one of the most annoying things anyone can do he also assumed the three top
jobs of president ceo and chairman of the board at the same time and embarked on a company-wide pr tour
on the corporate jet reminiscent of a political campaign all the while he began hacking and slashing
budgets shutting down factories and firing vps who looked at him the wrong way the 90s were a new
decade northern telecom had pretty much just been shortened to nortel by this point by 1991 they had
pulled even with at&t in the u.s switching market with a 40 share the new russian president boris
yeltsin even found time to visit the bnr labs on a visit to ottawa in 1992 where he jokingly tried to
pocket a microchip bnr meanwhile had spent the last few decades working on a new way to send phone calls
the pipes that humans have used to send phone calls hadn't really changed much since the 1800s they
started out using iron cables which although functional were highly sensitive to noise and
distortion early on many companies made the switch to copper cables and the world mostly stuck with
those for over a century but now they were hitting their upper limit and something better was needed
although they didn't invent the concept bell canada published one of the very first papers on fiber
optics in 1966 using ultra pure strands of glass you could pulse lasers to send digital ones and zeros
at incredible rates unveiled under the name fiber world nortel showcased a line of fiber optic
nodes that could achieve transmission speeds of 2.5 gigabits per second once again they had achieved
a multi-year head start over their rivals as the 90s began nortel was on the top of the world
here's a former employee explaining how they did it the company built great phone systems and when i
say they built them they really did they developed their own cpus wrote their own operating systems
manufactured all the boards and sheet metal and whatnot these customers moved slowly products were
installed and then expected to run for a decade or more with nothing but backwards compatible
upgrades provided during that time you charged an arm and a leg for what you delivered and it was
very profitable when you've been at sea for this long riding the waves of the market the previous
highs and lows begin to feel insignificant what was once the pinnacle of success is now just a small
crest the halfway point to a bigger and better wave nortel had built a 13 000 ton tanker optimized to
serve telephone companies and the sheer momentum of that looked like it would carry them for the next
decade but that momentum would turn out to be a critical flaw the age of the telephone company
was coming to an abrupt end our lives are busy and now from northern telecom a solution
1993 saw a big shake-up in leadership for both nortel and canada paul stern's abrasive personality and
budget bloodlust was tolerated up until 93 when nortel's biggest customer atlanta bell dropped nortel
following a string of reliability concerns paul stern's cuts had reached the r d centers and product
lines weren't being updated as much as before customers were noticing and they began to lose
ground at t again previously heralded as a genius paul stern's tactics were now seen as short-sighted
and he was painted as a tyrant bell canada intervened by blocking the appointment of stern's
close friend as president instead slotting in one of their own jean monte furious at being
undermined paul stern resigned in protest the paul stern years are not remembered fondly at nortel
and if he had any lasting legacy it was beginning the tradition of lucrative golden parachutes when
he resigned in disgrace he left the company with 5.4 million in compensation jean monte quickly
promoted to ceo had his work cut out for him 1993 was the middle of a deep recession in canada
and nortel's stock price reflected that speaking of the recession oh boy did people hate brian
mulroney plagued by scandals and unpopular policies mulroney resigned from politics just
months before his party suffered the worst election defeat in canada's history forever
dooming the pcs to irrelevance the pendulum finally swung back to the liberals seeing former cabinet
minister jean chretien ascend to the pm's office if mulroney was our reagan then chretien was our
clinton a liberal yes but a liberal who had been pushed to the right by a decade of conservative rule
the chretien years would be defined by an obsession with cutting the deficit housing healthcare nothing
was off limits as long as the number went down chretien had also partially campaigned on
renegotiating nafta a revised free trade agreement that would now include mexico but he didn't try
very hard negotiations have been pretty much finalized by bush and mulroney and reopening the
terms was just as likely to kill the deal altogether which was a political no-go the asymmetry between the
two countries meant there was very little weight canada could throw around even then on a personal
level chretien was not sympathetic to the canadian nationalists as finance minister chretien had
once been in charge of fira but he had always felt that american money in canada was a necessary
pill to swallow years earlier he had said that there were quote a lot of places in canada where
people don't give a damn who owns what they want a job and years later he said protectionism is
not left wing or right wing it is simply passe the free trade debate had effectively been settled
this new political paradigm was followed by radical changes in canada's telecom policy
and by that i mean massive deregulation it was a burning down of the entire playing field in the
name of increased competition bell canada's monopoly on long distance calls was broken their preferred
supplier agreement with nortel was torn up phone companies could be tv companies now tv companies could be
phone companies cell phones were a thing now too and everyone was welcome to take a crack at those
to survive you could no longer be just a telephone company you needed the thumb in every pie the us
underwent its own version of this with the telecom act of 96. the telecom act is mainly remembered for
flooding the tech market with a bunch of new capital and planting the seeds for the eventual dot-com bubble
but it also initiated a wake-up call at at&t the last decade had been brutal for them more
specifically western electric was weighing them down all the new baby bells and independent
telephone companies refused to buy from them because their money would still just be going
to their biggest rival and so at&t said fine we get the message we'll just spin it off western
electric was no more it underwent a makeover and adopted a fancy new name long time fans might recognize
this one lucent technologies nortel and lucent mirrored each other in the same way that the us and
canada mirrored each other the difference was just size and prestige lucent was the industry's 900
pound gorilla over twice as big as nortel bnr was respected sure but bell labs had six nobel prizes
and their latest hotshot physicist was bound to win them another nortel going public in the 70s was
a success by canadian standards but lucent's ipo it shattered the world record for most money raised
three billion in 1996 lucent would quickly become one of america's most widely held stocks if you
were betting on either of these two companies lucent would be the logical choice but both of them at
their core were telephone companies neither was truly prepared for the technological upheaval that
was going to define the 1990s something more radical unrestricted and unpredictable than the telephone
you see there's this new thing called the worldwide web a network that brought together text images
voice even video albeit heavily compressed all of it viewable on personal computers that were beginning
to pop up in middle class houses the telephone took 50 years to reach around half the us population
the internet did it in five as it turns out the copper wires most people had in their houses to
receive phone calls worked just as well when it came to delivering internet traffic telephone companies
like nortel were remarkably well positioned to gobble up this new internet market or at least they would
be if they weren't stuck in their old habits if lucent represented the old guard the establishment then
cisco represented the next generation a relatively new company it was an internet startup fresh out of
silicon valley it had blazed a trail in the 80s as the brainchild of four stanford professors and
quickly ate up a huge share of the telecom market whereas lucent had decades of at t's legacy behind
it in a massive scale cisco was small maneuverable and adaptive its ceo was a cool guy he raced speed
boats and most importantly it had picked the correct side in a civil war being waged by a bunch of nerds
the two factions were called the bell heads and the net heads and they each had a competing vision for
how the internet should be transmitted the bell heads were most often legacy telephone engineers who
worked for companies like at&t and bell they championed something called atm switching asynchronous
transfer mode on the other hand you had the net heads fans of ip or internet packet switching net
heads were likely to be open source nerds working out of universities or maverick tech entrepreneurs
working out of silicon valley startups desperate to try and disrupt the at&t's of the world the bell
heads loved atm because it built up the same principles of telephone switching when you set up a telephone
connection you want a live continuous conversation no buffering you set up a link between points a and
b and shut out all other traffic it's fast and high capacity it's not so great though if one point
along the route breaks down now you have to reroute and set up an entirely new connection that's where
packet switching excelled packet switching is like mailing someone a jigsaw puzzle but each individual
piece can get split up and take a different route to the destination it doesn't matter because once
they all reach the destination they just get assembled into say an email ip by its very nature
is decentralized immune to single points of failure and notably very hard to track customer billing with
which frustrated the bell heads to no end atm was ideal for the high capacity optical fiber networks
that nortel and lucent specialized in whereas ip was best used with ethernet cables and routers
that cisco had built its fortune off of in the 80s it wasn't super clear who was winning this civil war
but by the mid 90s it was it was the netheads ip was king and by the end of the decade atm was just
going to be another forgotten technology like betamax was to vhs if you wanted to use the internet you
had to endure this sound and hope that no one else at home was expecting a phone call no one wanted on
demand real-time video calls in this era they were happy with emails slow loading websites and if
they were feeling fancy downloading software from the internet activities where buffering and latency
didn't matter atm was on paper the better technology but the market had committed to ip nortel needed to
course correct as soon as possible this is when we meet john roth he's what you'd call a company man
a canadian he grew up in lethbridge alberta and joined nortel in 1969. although he went to school
for electrical engineering his true talents were not in design during his entire career at nortel he
never made it onto a single patent he was instead destined to climb the corporate ladder and at just
35 years old he became a general manager the youngest person ever in that role he'd break that
record again when he became a vp next he hopped on over to president of bnr nortel's beloved crown jewel
and later he pushed for nortel to get into the wireless market but his ascension up the corporate
ladder was far from over and by the end of the paul stern years he was president of nortel north america
by 95 with jean monte's remodeling well underway roth was made his heir apparent taking on the
role of coo for two years before finally getting to wear the big boy pants in 1997 with monte heading
upstairs to become ceo of bell canada enterprises the model canadian ceo is like a canadian supreme court
justice the average canadian probably doesn't know your name certainly something that can't be said
for their american counterparts john roth was no bill gates and he wasn't a steve jobs his first ever
interview as ceo he seemed deeply uncomfortable with the attention he was boring the business
press was confounded by him the globe and mail unable to find something interesting to say about
him instead described his body as lanky and weird feels uncalled for some people compared him to the
nebulous cigarette smoking man from the tv show the x files in other words an enigma he also had big
shoes to fill monte had been named canadian ceo of the year in 97 after he turned the company around
following the disastrous paul stern years as you know from the intro john roth will win the same award
but the road he takes to get there is a little bit bumpier
let us introduce the john roth threshold
this is the stock price on the day he assumed the title of ceo
if he leaves the company above this line he was a success let's see how he does just two months in
on december 3rd 1997 john roth sent out a now iconic email to all 74 000 employees of nortel
it was entitled the right angle turn nortel needed to pivot if you asked him john roth could tell you
the exact moment he realized the internet was the future like many millionaires he's an avid car
collector one day he was trying to find a replacement liner for the glove box of his 1966 jaguar e-type
but he couldn't find one in canada but as he says here i started poking around and within five minutes
i'm in a little garage north of london a four-man operation and he's got my parts how would i have
ever found this person if he wasn't on the web truly a man ahead of his time he quickly got addicted
to online shopping and bought a 1950s jukebox and a pool table john roth made it clear nortel
was an internet company now how they were going to do that was a serious question this is a point of
contention and i've heard two sides to this john roth supposedly went to his technical people and
asked them how long it would take to get a foothold into ip he was told around two years which was too
slow for him on the other hand i've heard firsthand accounts that nortel's engineers had a good grasp on ip
and had even published some papers on it in their in-house journal one of those papers even described
a device extremely similar to the iphone a whole decade ahead of time there appears to be a
disconnect john roth and the executives he surrounded himself with did not trust their own engineers that
they were dinosaurs who were stuck in their ways this is perhaps the reason that nortel made the
controversial decision to shut down bnr in 1996 bnr and its 17 000 employees was dissolved and absorbed
into the rest of nortel the bell labs of canada no longer existed the name bnr beloved by those who
worked there was erased unceremoniously in the span of just one weekend the corporate logo cops paid a
visit to ottawa and had removed every trace that the name bnr ever existed for some long-time rnd folks
it felt like quote a dagger to the heart why bnr was dissolved is a bit of a mystery it's possible it
wasn't profitable on its own viewed as a multi-billion dollar sinkhole that couldn't exist in this new era
that saw bell downgraded from its long-distance monopoly by some bnr's culture was viewed as
arrogant they saw themselves as better than the rest even down to their insistence that they use
macs instead of pcs they needed to be reined in brought into line with the same cost controls
and accountability as the rest of the company executives began to place less emphasis on nortel as a
hardware company and more so as a software company that specialized in networks if john roth needed
r d he would have to find it elsewhere and thus began the intense speculation of a merger for months
in 1998 there were rumors swirling in the business press that two of the big three may pair up any
partnership that emerged would almost certainly be able to crush the odd one out nortel and lucent
would be massive complete domination in the telephone market and their combined size could easily fund the
r d to catch up to cisco in ip a combo of lucent and cisco or nortel and cisco would be the perfect
marriage of legacy telephone tech with cutting-edge ip technology how far along any of these talks got
is unclear lucent and nortel had a huge product line overlap any merger would make huge sections
of the new company redundant and rumors of a merger between lucent and cisco caused the ftc to jump in and say
hey uh we might block this because this is maybe a monopoly there was also a fair amount of personal
animosity between the three companies ceos that made any deal with lucent highly unlikely richard
mcginn ceo of lucent had infamously hung up wanted posters of john roth and john chambers inside offices
as a way to motivate his employees a move that the other two found tasteless furthermore lucent had
recently poached three top nortel execs and then they went on to sue cisco over patent infringement
by this point the only merger that made any sense was between nortel and cisco and so in june 1998
john roth makes an announcement that would forever change the trajectory of the entire industry a
decision that would set nortel on the path to become the most valuable company in canada john
roth announces that he is buying the ip switching company bay networks for 9.1 billion dollars
he's buying cisco's biggest competitor john roth had set off a three-way arms race
do you know that sound of course you do it's the high-speed wireless internet it can reach all kinds
of neat stuff oh cool want to see live video of the accident no thanks if you ask a dozen x nortel
employees what killed nortel i'm willing to bet a third of them would say bay networks not because
it delivered the killing blow but instead because it was the first of many increasingly bad decisions
it just took a while for everyone to realize the mistake when nortel acquired bay networks it was
anything but ordinary it cost 9.1 billion dollars staggering for the time cisco had acquired around
five companies in the years leading up to it but each had a price tag that only ran into the millions
bay was not a small company and in fact had been the product of an earlier merger they had around 7
000 employees most of them in silicon valley all of whom were immediately added to nortel's workforce
bay networks was such a huge ad that nortel even got one last name change becoming nortel networks
the company's ceo dave house was immediately made nortel's new president right under john roth the
two went on a worldwide press tour where they were seen by some as quote batman and robin yet despite
all the fanfare the purchase was greeted by the markets with a resounding thud people honestly
thought john roth had blown it bay was way over the hill their product line had already matured too much
and they had way overpaid during fall 1998 the stock price tanked and many thought that john
roth would be out the door far sooner than expected but then lucent blinked see lucent had
actually been one of bay network's biggest customers the nortel purchase had completely
locked them out of the ip space and management began to panic and so in january 1999 lucent buys
ascend communications the next biggest company comparable to bay networks except they paid a much
steeper price than nortel did a whopping 20 billion dollars if people thought nortel had overpaid then
lucent got fleeced ascend had been doing so poorly brokers jokingly called it ass end following this
example cisco which had already been buying companies at a frantic pace went into absolute pac-man mode
and gobbled up 18 companies in just 1999. the next year cisco's grand total would stand at 64 acquired
companies and lucent was no slouch either bingo bango bongo john roth had every reason to be smug
and he took a shot at cisco saying we can learn to spell ip faster than cisco can learn to spell
reliable look you gotta hand it to the man he's got sick burns so you're happy with the bay purchase
absolutely you feel you paid the right price well it looks like a bargain now in retrospect
compared to some of the other deals are going down okay feeling vindicated now john roth had
permission from nortel's board to go on a shopping spree between the years of 1999 and 2000 nortel
bought a new company at an average rate of one per month some were small firms with just one exciting
r d project others were well-established industry names bay networks would remain their most expensive
purchase but more than a few of them crossed over the billion dollar threshold altian web systems was
grabbed for almost six billion dollars yet another big player in the ethernet and ip space kairos went
for three billion with just 90 employees they were developing a cutting-edge technology that would
enable optical switching using tiny microscopic mirrors this shopping spree was indiscriminate and
at times appeared to lack a clear focus one of nortel's other major purchases was clarify an e-commerce
firm acquired for 2.1 billion exactly why john roth wanted to take his telecom firm into the world of
customer relations software is unclear frankly some of these purchases were made entirely so that lucent
and cisco couldn't have them with every new acquisition came hundreds and in some cases thousands
of new employees nortel ballooned from 74 000 employees up to 95. in some towns like richardson texas
and maidenhead in britain nortel was the single biggest employer the right angle turn was a full
blown corporate makeover employees would walk into the office and see a giant right angle arrow
decorating the floor this was a company that was fast from 1997 nortel went from spending just five
percent of their r d on internet to over 60 percent in 1999. nortel's fiber technology went from 2.5
gigabits per second up to 10. four times faster than anyone else in the world nortel used to plan
its projects in years with full life cycles often being decades because that's what telephone
companies wanted roth insisted on a new time frame web years really just fiscal quarters because that's
how fast the new economy was moving and he wasn't wrong internet startups had exploded in the last
couple years in 1995 netscape had an ipo that raised almost 3 billion dollars in just one day it seemed
like anyone who could code a website in their garage could become a millionaire overnight and nortel had
to accommodate that just look at the way its marketing evolved in the past decade this is a
sales video from the 80s meridian one communication systems are leading worldwide with over 50 000 digital
voice and data systems installed ranging in size from 30 to 60 000 lines now whether you need 30 lines
or 200 lines the new meridian one option 11 will enhance your business success
without the nightmares and this is a new employee training video from around y2k
and in joining us you are instantly connected connected connected so here's what you get advanced
technology now the world is your palette research and development shaping the way that people would
communicate in the future pretty tight cohesive teams this is where the action is you are now
instantly connected this is how you connect this is where you connect welcome to nortel networks
welcome to nortel networks welcome to nortel networks even promotions were fast tim dempsey
recalls that he spent on average 18 months in any given role quote we sometimes counted bosses per
year instead of years per boss another employee i spoke to mentioned that they had five different
managers in the same year some of them they never even met in person even john roth the person was
fast the business press had latched on to his obsession with fast cars finally there was something
interesting they could write about are you still buying used parts for your 66 66 jag over the net
well it's in pretty good shape now so i moved on to other things uh last last day my wife and i bought
some oil paintings over the net meanwhile in the background of all of this the rest of canadian
high tech had undergone what can only be described as a gold rush throughout the 70s 80s and 90s engineers
who first got their start at nortel had been leaving to found startups and then those startups led to
startups creating a multi-generational family tree that led back to nortel mitel correll newbridge
mosaids calian gandalf memtech epitech lumonics siltronics nabu architect norpac canadian
astronautics jds by y2k in the ottawa region there were over 1 000 companies employing 75 000 people
and one in five of them belong to nortel ottawa's tech scene in the 1990s actually grew faster than the
real silicon valley earning it the nickname silicon valley north city council even tried to rebrand with
a new slogan which did not go over well you ready for this the city of ottawa technically beautiful
i'd make a joke here but a city councillor already beat me to it if i called my daughter technically
beautiful she'd hit me nortel was proudly canada's single largest spender of r d in 2000 it spent 5.9
billion which no exaggeration is more than every other company combined the nortel recruitment
process at universities was so robust some likened it to hockey talent scouts at one point one in five
engineering grads in canada were being hired by nortel one in five if you had a master's or phd
that rose to one in three from everyone i've spoken to every interview i've read nortel in the 90s was one
of the best places to work in canada you were paid well and if you wanted to take a training course
they'd pay to send you the job wasn't just here do this task it was more like what can i do to make
your job easier a local car dealer told a newspaper that if nortel didn't exist half of his customers
would disappear overnight dress code was lax no time clock in an office gym and they threw legendary
parties every other week one recruiter called it a corporate disneyland and this next bit sounds like
a fake fact and i i can't confirm this but i want it to be true nortel may have hosted north america's
largest recreational softball league with six different skill tiers and thousands of players
nortel had transformed the image of an entire capital city it had helped to rebrand canada as more
than the place where you got lumber dairy and maple syrup nortel was a company that was defining what
tomorrow looked like and nowhere was this more crystallized than in their latest ad campaign
nortel had splurged for the rights to use the beatles song come together and on the nose slogan
about their new networking focus now you might wonder why does a company like nortel even run ads
in the first place most nortel products aren't something the average consumer could walk into a best
buy and pick up off the shelf no these ads weren't trying to sell you on the tech they were selling
you on the brand the average person may not buy a nortel switch but they could certainly buy nortel
stock strap in you're about to witness a once in a lifetime phenomenon i like to call the toronto stock
explosion
nortel networks is changing the way businesses communicate
it's been a hot minute since i updated our little stock tracker back here and that's
because to truly appreciate what you're about to see unfold you need to take a peek behind the
curtain in the year 2000 approximately 75 percent of north america's backbone internet traffic was
carried through nortel equipment nortel was bringing in revenues in the hundreds of millions
but that's not how the stock market works the stock market by its very nature is speculative
people are paying prices based on what they think a company should be worth in the future
so although you can look at things like sales assets business deals acquisitions
a lot of it comes down to guesswork in 1993 nortel was bringing in 25 times as many sales as
newbridge networks and yet nortel was only worth 1.5 times what newbridge was in market cap
share price is not a reflection of some universal value there's no formula you can punch a bunch of
numbers into and get a single objective number sometimes the people trading a stock have no idea
what they're talking about other times people know a little too much about a stock and in some cases
the mechanics of the market are just plain being exploited due to its peculiar position in the canadian
economy nortel had hijacked the rules of the game and had found a way to print money this is how they
did it stocks are traded on stock markets whether that's in person or through a computer doesn't
matter a company like nortel trades on a lot of different markets london tokyo new york they sell
their shares wherever they're allowed same product different stores some markets are more competitive
than others your company needs to be a big deal to get listed on wall street for example and even
then you're probably going to be a small fish in a big pond nortel did well on wall street in 2000
wall street listed its top 24 in stocks and only four were canadian three of them were barrack gold
alcan aluminum and placer dome in other words mining and resource extraction nortel was the only tech
stock but where nortel truly shined was in its home arena back on bay street at the toronto stock
exchange on the tsc nortel was the mvp first things first is the currency issue although canadians often
invest in american companies every time we make a trade we're taking a small hit due to the currency
conversion which can add up over time but on top of that canada actually has laws that puts a cap on
the percentage of foreign securities you can have in certain investments mutual funds rrsps
you're generally capped to somewhere between 20 to 30 for foreign stocks these two factors explain
why canadians were biased towards canadian stocks but it doesn't explain why there was a sudden surge
of investing in the year 2000 for that we can look at two recent changes the first was a change in
pensions i'm very sorry i have to do this this is actually necessary the two main types of pensions
are defined benefit and defined contribution a defined benefit pension is when both you and your
employer pay into it but it's fully on them to manage it when you retire they are obligated to
pay you an agreed upon amount per month this is the type of pension that most canadians had at this
point but by the late 90s there is a big push to transition over to the other type of pension
in a defined contribution pension you and your employer both still put money into it but now it's on
you to manage it you are responsible for your money low risk high risk whatever you want but the
amount you get at retirement is now entirely on you the liberal government was eager to transfer over
huge swaths of its employees over to defined contribution pensions that included the work
forces of canada post the armed forces the mounties and the gargantuan public servants alliance
that was hundreds of thousands of pensions and tens of billions of dollars that was going to be sunk
into the canadian stock market even the canadian pension plan the old age social safety net for
almost half the country was about to invest its surplus of two billion dollars right into the market
this was on top of the pension funds that were already heavily invested in the market like 35
billion from ontario's civil servants and 68 billion from ontario's teachers the second big increase in
investment was due to the capital gains tax a capital gain is any profit you make on an investment which
includes stocks at the start of the year 2000 the capital gains rate was 75 meaning 75 of any profit you
made would be considered income and taxed according to your tax bracket but by february it had been lowered
to 66 and then to 50 by october anytime the capital gains tax is lowered it leads to a surge of new money
flowing into the market you saw the same thing happen in the u.s when they cut their capital gains rate in 1997
with more upside to potential trades the average joe was willing to try their hand at the stock market
and this was the late 90s too technology had made trading more accessible than ever before
in the olden days if you wanted to invest you had to go to a bank get a broker call them on the phone
and then tell them to make a trade for you that's so passe people were quitting their full-time jobs
to sit at home on the computer and trade stocks on the internet you can see here the beginnings of
what might turn into a feedback loop canadians need to invest in canada so they invest in the latest big
name nortel which goes up in price which then generates positive media coverage and so on and so
on but we're just getting started here the wheels are still firmly on this wagon the last piece of the
puzzle here is something called an index fund stock exchanges employ a lot of metrics stats it's useful
to have just one number to track an index that represents how good the exchange is doing now
you've probably heard of the dow jones or the s p 500 essentially they try to boil down the entire
market into just the top 30 or 500 stocks some like the dow jones use what is called price weighting
where a company's fraction of the index is their market cap divided by the total number of shares
others like the s p 500 use what is called float weighting for a given stock their contribution to
the index considers both their total market cap as well as the total number of shares available to the
general public that's two variables if you were to put this into a pie chart today's s p 500 looks a
bit like this the behemoth tech firms like microsoft apple google amazon take up big chunks because of
their billions of shares but most of the pie is made up of tiny slices an index fund is a type of
investment that tries to track a pie chart just like this if i put in a thousand dollars and google is
five percent of the pie then five percent of my a thousand dollars goes into google every time the
index updates so does my investment in the ultra competitive market of the us no one company has
clear dominance resulting in a nice and diversified portfolio i won't see a huge chunk of money disappear
if one company goes under but what if you add a smaller less competitive market could one company
with a particularly massive number of shares take over the index this is the tse 300 it's one index that
combines the performance of top 300 companies listed on the toronto stock exchange in october 1998
nortel share of the tse 300 was less than five percent lagging just behind its parent company bce
but by september of 1999 it had taken the top spot grown to eight percent one month later it was 10
by november it was 11 and by the end of january it would be 16 what is going on here well for one
nortel share price is going up but that's just one half of the picture you see nortel's total share
count was rapidly multiplying where had all these new shares come from normally the number of shares
a company has is fairly arbitrary a company with 100 shares and a company with a million shares could
have the same market cap simply because one has a much higher share price sometimes companies undergo
what is called a stock split they multiply the total number of shares say by two and divide the price
of each share by two keeping the total market cap the same nortel in its history had undergone four
stock splits two of them under john roth a fact he was happy to brag about however a stock split in a
vacuum is neither a good nor a bad sign it's just an attempt by a company to draw in new investors by
making a single share more accessible it's not like john roth could just keep doing it like an infinite
money glitch the market would be quick to punish him and take nortel stock price he could go and print
new shares as part of employee stock options and in fact he did this many times nortel was notorious
for handing out stock options like candy even the janitor got some over just a few years he had printed
a hefty 161 million new shares this too though wasn't something he could do over and over many of nortel's
largest shareholders complained that their shares were being diluted if nortel wanted more shares they
would have to get creative enter the butterfly plan so by this point nortel's parent company
bell canada now renamed bce owned the largest chunk of nortel's shares 39 so john roth although
powerful couldn't unilaterally make decisions without first getting the approval of his boss
john monti and the rest of the board without bell's monopoly money and a preferred supplier agreement
nortel would likely have gone under decades ago but bce wasn't a monopoly anymore and nortel had
quickly outgrown its parent in the year 2000 bce's stake of nortel made up 78 percent of bce's total value
think about that this is the country's largest telephone internet and tv provider nortel's
revenues had grown 26 percent in 1999 the entirety of bce's other holdings only grew five percent owning
nortel right now seems like a good problem to have but john monti wasn't entirely pleased with the
situation nortel distorted bce's numbers so much that the market was likely undervaluing bce's stock
price and because they no longer had a majority stake he was fine with simply divesting their shares
that would mean more autonomy for both bce and nortel which would allow monti to pursue his goal of
creating a domestic media empire thanks to the deregulation of the past decade later that year
bce would go on to acquire the country's largest private news company ctv as well as a major
newspaper in the globe and mail as well as dozens of local news stations selling off nortel would
allow both companies to divide and conquer with bce taking on media and nortel taking on tech the
question was how to give away the shares you would think that they would just sell them make a killing
and pocket the cash but the resulting tax cost would be immense so they decided to instead push that
onto the shareholders they came up with a plan known as the butterfly distribution where for
every bce share that you held you'd keep that share but also gain 0.78 nortel shares and the
total amount of nortel shares would be split doubling in number if you're lost that that's honestly okay
but the bottom line here is that there were now an additional 502 million nortel shares on the open
market before this bce was the most widely held stock in canada now it was nortel this immediately
increases nortel's weighting on the tsc 300 the butterfly plan brought nortel from 16 up to 26.
one quarter of the entire country's premier stock exchange was simply nortel but we're not done here
we've got room to keep going up the butterfly plan was a one-time thing if john roth wanted a license to
print shares he needed a repeatable strategy he found one in bay networks i said earlier it cost
nortel 9.1 billion to acquire them but i didn't mean 9.1 billion in cash no nortel had paid for it
with shares john roth had gone to the company treasury with the permission of the board and
printed 134 million new shares which were handed over to the executives and employees of the newly
acquired company now there was a little worry about share dilution but so long as the share
price continued to go up john roth was able to keep his investors happy the tsc 300 immediately
accounts for all these new shares in nortel's weighting this in turn causes all index funds in
the country to go out and purchase more nortel shares which has the cyclical effect of raising nortel's
share price which also again factors into nortel's weighting can you see where i'm going with this
nortel acquired 18 companies in two years and of the 30 billion dollars it had spent 22 billion was paid
for with shares the shopping spree had injected 972 million new shares into the market and here's
another thing not all of these shares printed for these acquisitions were actually available on the open
market if you print a bunch of new shares and give them to employees they're getting a gift for free
understandably they don't know if the stock price is going to go up or down and it's in their best
interest to just sell them immediately and make a profit millions of shares being dumped right after
a buyout looks bad on nortel hence the buyouts usually included an escrow clause the employees
of the acquired company are given the nortel shares but they can't sell them until the end of
an escrow period which can be anywhere from six months to a year and a half and yet even though
these new shares aren't technically public the tsc 300 still increases nortel's weighting this triggers
another round of index funds trying to buy shares except there are fewer shares available to actually
meet this new demand this artificial scarcity drives nortel's share price even higher which in turn
increases its weighting and around and around we go are you following starting in 1998 nortel had
gone from having around 500 million shares to over 3 billion nortel had exploited the intricacies of
the canadian stock market so badly that by the summer of 2000 it made up 38 percent of the entire
toronto stock exchange 38 percent does this make sense does this seem fair i promise you it shouldn't
and then things got worse so those index funds we were talking about with nortel continually eating
more and more of the tsc pie index fund managers had to buy more and more nortel to fill up their
clients portfolios but sometime around late 1999 they ran into a snag see there's actually a law in
ontario that prevents mutual and index funds from having more than 10 of their value in one stock
maybe you see the issue here nortel was now more than 10 of the pie it was illegal for index funds
to match the tsc 300 and that was a problem see the reason people go to professional investors is
that they're supposed to know better than the average person but with the market being anywhere
from 15 to 25 percent nortel unless your investment manager was a savant or a psychic there was no
reliable way for them to outperform the market thanks to aggressive lobbying efforts on january 28
2000 the ontario securities commission introduced what many people called the nortel rule nortel was
not explicitly named in this change but it was the only company the rule impacted index funds were now
allowed to go over the 10 cap mutual fund managers were out of luck and they were still stuck at 10.
the tsc 300 throughout most of the year 2000 was mockingly called the nortel index because all it
really told you was whether or not nortel had a good day or not at some point you would think that
someone in charge would step in and say hey this is kind of like passing a law where you don't have
to wear a seat belt if the car has a convertible and you have the roof down safety regulations are
optional so long as you're trying to do something cool but no remember the canadian pension plan 80
of it was an index fund tracking the tsc 300 retirement funds pensions personal portfolios
all over the country were packed to the gills with nortel canadians were bombarded with nortel
everywhere they looked it was on the news it was in commercials maybe they knew about it because their
uncle worked there and his stock plan was paying for his new kitchen or maybe their buddy made three
k off of nortel thanks to a good trade the other week now they've got fomo they want to get in on
the bandwagon too they want to make money obviously but you know deep down there's probably a little
part of them that's you know patriotic they're happy they're supporting the home team maybe canada
doesn't make its own cars or make its own movies and you know what we don't even make switches what we
do make is money in march 2000 at the very height of the dot-com bubble nortel had finally
surpassed lucent's market cap the mouse had eaten the elephant
and on july 26 nortel set its all-time stock price record of 124 dollars and 50 cents
with a market cap of 400 billion dollars it was the ninth most valuable company in the entire world
world but there was a leak in the boat maybe some of you caught it i certainly glanced over it
see paying for a company with shares instead of cash is not some infinite money glitch of course not
if it was why would anyone ever pay with cash despite what the headlines on nortel's press releases
said nortel was not doing so hot the truth was always out there hidden in the fine print
nortel hadn't turned a profit in four years an enterprise that had existed for over a century
would not make it out of the next decade this is nortel and this is how it broke canada
