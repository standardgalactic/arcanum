Hello, everybody, and welcome back to another episode of the Magnus History Podcast.
Today, we're very happy to have with us a guest that really doesn't need much of an introduction,
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, who's a world-renowned economics professor,
best-selling author, and a global leader in sustainable development and really geopolitics as well.
Professor Sachs is the director at the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University,
where he holds the rank of university professor, the university's highest academic rank.
He had been at Harvard before that for many years.
He's served as advisor to numerous UN Secretary Generals.
We're very happy to have him join us today.
Thank you very much, Jeff, for joining us on the Magnus History Podcast.
We're honored to have you.
I just want to come straight.
My pleasure.
Thanks.
We just wanted to go straight, start with the kind of the global developments,
and then talk more about what's going on in the region here.
In a recent article, you actually talk, you say, and I want to quote you,
you say, the recent BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, marks the end of the new account delusions,
and that since the 1990s, the goal of American foreign policy has been primacy, aka global hegemony.
So I'm wondering what this means exactly.
So this idea of a liberal order, liberal international order that the U.S. had been dominating,
which seems to be evaporating before our eyes, at least sitting in Beirut.
It seems to be disappearing.
The questions about the U.N., about international law,
all of this seems to be very, very seriously questioned in a way that it wasn't before.
And in the meantime, we have this rise of the BRICS in a kind of different world.
Can you explain a little bit these developments as they pertain to the U.S.?
And perhaps even now that Trump has been elected, what this might have an impact?
For a very long time, maybe you could date it almost to America's beginning in the 17th century.
Maybe you could date it to the sweep across North America in the 19th century, Manifest Destiny.
Or maybe you could date it to the post-World War II order when the United States assumed that it was the world leader.
The so-called grand strategy or the taken-for-granted strategy of America's elite is that America should run the world.
And to do that, the United States has created a worldwide network of military installations and CIA operations to try to run the world.
Of course, it never achieved its goal because the U.S. is 4 percent of the world population and much of the rest of the 96 percent doesn't want to be run by the U.S.
But this aspiration is very deep in the American psyche.
It comes with the power and the wealth of the United States with a very militaristic vision of the world.
If you don't like us, either get out of the way or we'll topple you or we'll invade you.
And that has been American foreign policy for many decades.
I think we should put aside the baby word of liberal in liberal order.
There's nothing liberal about the United States.
The United States, the United States, is a militaristic regime that learned its militarism from the British Empire, which was the most militarized state of the 19th century.
And the U.S. learned at the knee of the British Empire.
And the U.S. has been a militarized state pretty much nonstop since 1945.
When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, the assumption of the U.S. security elites or state elites is, well, we won.
Now we are the most powerful country in the world in history.
We are not the new Rome.
We have surpassed Rome.
No one can stop us.
We can take down anyone.
And that was the mindset of crazy people like Richard Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, and many others.
And every president that came in was basically instructed by them.
You are the leader of the most powerful machine of military force and coercion in world history.
You are the center of the world financial system.
You can turn on and off the financial spigots to any part of the world.
You are at the node of the world information system.
You can survey and intercept and disrupt information flows to any place in the world.
You're at the center of the world energy system.
You can turn on and off the taps.
And if they don't like it, you can blow up the pipelines to do it.
So this is the mindset.
It is definitely the mindset of the incoming U.S. administration, even if the means might be different.
There's no change in U.S. mindset.
It's not exactly a joke that Donald Trump tweets every day that Canada is the 51st state.
It's partly taunting.
It's partly a game.
But I'm sure he has in his mind, why don't we own all that territory?
Why isn't the United States the owner of Greenland, in fact, as he says every day?
Because the Chinese and the Russians are going to have more control over the northern sea route.
So we better literally expand the map.
To my mind, these people are, you know, playing the game I used to play in my childhood, the game of risk, which was a fun game where the idea was to have your piece on every part of the board.
That's how you won.
You took over the world.
You'd roll the dice.
And eventually you'd wear down, through a war of attrition, your neighbor, if you had more pieces on the board.
But they play this with real lives.
And they play it with brutality, cynicism, coercion, subterfuge.
And they play it till today.
I'm sorry to say it.
It's just this is really the way the world is.
But, Jeff, some people are, including you, I think, have been talking about a phenomenon called de-dollarization, which we hear a lot about.
So could you could you explain what de-dollar?
I mean, I think we're familiar with it, but just for our audience, could you explain what de-dollarization is?
And also, more importantly for this conversation, could you then say, well, what does that mean for U.S. power, U.S. hegemony, U.S. authority, even U.S. prosperity itself, insofar as there is still prosperity in the U.S.?
That's great. And as I was running on and on, I forgot to mention the main point, which is that this vision of the U.S. is delusional.
That's the bottom line. I forgot to mention that.
I did say the U.S. is 4.1 percent of the world population. We're about 335 million out of some 8 billion people.
It's not enough to run the world. The U.S. is very proud of its military prowess and its technology.
But frankly, there are a lot of countries in the world that can blow up the U.S. and can blow up the world.
So it isn't hegemony. It isn't unipolarity. It isn't being the sole superpower.
But it is a lot of power. I mean, no other country in the world even remotely comes close to this military archipelago of bases around the world.
80 countries estimated. They don't make formal lists.
So we have to guess around 750 military bases.
Britain still has a big network. Their nostalgia for empire is impressive.
Let me say a little pathetic, but impressive.
But the United States really stands on its own.
Now, the state of affairs is that the U.S. has had several rude awakenings.
You know, it couldn't win, actually, back in Korea.
There was an armistice that ended that conflict.
It certainly didn't win in Vietnam. It didn't win in Afghanistan.
It didn't, quote, win anywhere, even though it beat the shit out of these other places.
It couldn't actually achieve its political goals or often its military goals, even.
So the idea of unipolarity is a kind of textbook idea of some second-rate thinkers in my mind.
But it is a prevailing idea.
Now, what are the bases of this?
The core basis is supposed to be the size of the economy.
Unfortunately for the U.S., it probably, in best comparative terms, is now a smaller economy to China.
So this is a matter of tremendous frustration to the American leaders and their self-proclaimed unipolarity.
Another feature of this is the role of the dollar, which means that when Lebanon and Saudi Arabia make a transaction together, make a trade,
it's likely to be in U.S. dollars, actually, rather than in local currency.
Even when China trades in the Middle East or other places, up until recently, it has been in dollars.
What does it mean in dollars?
It means through U.S.-based banks or banks that deal in U.S. dollars, which mean that the banks hold dollar assets in the United States,
either in counterpart banks or at the Federal Reserve.
It also means that transactions pass through a U.S.-controlled electronic system, the best-known part of which is so-called SWIFT system,
which is an interbank notification system for transactions.
This means that the U.S. has had a major ability to turn off financial transactions or to impose sanctions or to threaten countries that if they don't follow the U.S. line,
their banks will be cut off from international commerce.
In other words, countries doing business in other parts of the world that have nothing to do with the U.S. per se,
but happen to settle the transactions through a U.S.-based banking system.
This is what the role of the dollar has meant.
Now, as a monetary economist, I can tell you there's no intrinsic reason why Thailand and Brazil should settle a trade in dollars.
There are every other way to do that, but you need to create the institutional mechanisms for a non-dollar settlement system.
It could be in Taibod. It could be in Brazilian reales. It could be in Chinese renminbi.
But you need institutions and technical mechanisms to make such a settlement and a policy framework to do it.
The dollar has been convenient for everybody up until recently.
It became less convenient when the U.S. government started confiscating your dollars if you got out of line.
And so if you were the government of Venezuela or Iran or North Korea or Afghanistan and most recently Russia,
if the U.S. Treasury didn't like you, well, your money is now our money.
And the U.S. froze $300 billion of financial balances that Russia held in dollar assets in a European institution called Euroclear based in Belgium.
The idea of the BRICS countries, which of course started with the acronym Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa,
and then expanded to include Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran and the United Arab Emirates and now is expanding to another nine countries in 2025,
is that these are countries that don't want the U.S. to be able to turn on and off the spigot.
So they are reengineering their financial transactions so that their settlements are impervious to U.S. bluster.
Of course, Donald Trump, even before he enters the presidency, has already waved his finger and threatened these countries.
If the BRICS dare to challenge the U.S. dollar dominance, we will show you.
Well, let's see. I doubt it.
But also, Jeff, like in terms, I mean, the U.S. has been able to finance its debt, which is obviously in dollars,
because of the clout of the dollar in world markets, right?
So this is another issue, which is.
I mean, insofar as the U.S. power is tied to U.S. debt, which is 36 trillion or whatever.
There are two aspects in which this dollar role plays to the U.S. advantage.
One is the capacity to meddle, the capacity to make one's own sanctions,
the so-called unilateral coercive measures, meaning the U.S. says to another country,
you don't trade with China or you don't trade with Russia.
To make that effective has been the dominance of U.S.-based settlements.
So that's the part that I was emphasizing earlier.
There's another part, which is that if other countries are settling in your currency,
they will want to hold your assets for their liquidity.
In other words, they will want to hold dollar balances, dollar bank accounts.
They may earn some interest on that, but rather low interest rates,
because they need to hold those balances to be able to do their daily business.
So in this sense, the U.S. has had very good financing terms for a long time.
But kind of as a drunkard addict of running out your credit card,
the United States has built up a tremendous debt because the terms of borrowing have been so easy.
And now we're seeing that as other countries don't want to hold their balances,
their liquid assets in dollars, they can hold them in renminbi,
they can hold them in gold, they can hold them in crypto,
they can hold them in other means.
The terms of finance for the U.S. will worsen.
Interest rates are rising.
And that's not, in my view, only because of short-term cyclical factors,
the inflation that arose in the context of the COVID disruptions and war.
I think it is a deeper fact, which is that what Charles de Gaulle 60 years ago
called America's exorbitant privilege is become less privileged
as other countries are moving away from dollar reserves and dollar settlements.
Now, economists debate, is this really happening?
Will the BRICS get away with it?
Is it empty bluster?
Will Donald Trump's finger-wagging be determinative and keep countries back?
I can tell you, even within the BRICS, there are hesitations.
Oh, maybe we shouldn't go this way.
You know, maybe the U.S. will punish us.
So there still is fear of the United States.
You know it in the Middle East.
I see the U.S. as, you know, an arrogant, hubristic country
that is a bit deluded in its power.
But if you look around the Middle East, a lot of countries are terrified of the U.S.
or think we can't step out of line.
They'll kill us or they won't sell us the F-35s
or we won't get our spare parts for our planes
or they'll bring down our regime.
So there is still a lot of question and debate about the trajectory of relative power.
It's not so easy to quantify as measuring GDP.
But my view is it's going to fade faster than people think.
One other fact we should keep in mind, one other part of the debate.
Does the U.S. have a chokehold on the critical technologies?
And there are several that are claimed to be chokeholds,
the most important of which is advanced chips,
very small two or three nanometer chips that are crucial for AI, for example.
And it's claimed that the U.S. is going to keep the lead for years or decades.
The second area is space technology, the capacity to put heavy payloads in space
and to do other things in space.
My own view, though I'm not the final authority on any of these technologies to be sure,
is that claims of such technology chokeholds in the past have proved to be pretty ephemeral
in practice.
So I don't believe that the U.S. lead is so big, so decisive,
that in the end it's going to be able to bat away the competition.
I think the dollar will lose its preeminence.
I think the BRICS will be a real counterweight.
I think China will remain a very powerful, pure competitor and even larger economy
and certainly a larger industrial economy than the United States.
And so my view is geopolitics is really changing,
though, of course, the uncertainties about that are real.
Every week, I'm looking for it right now on my desk, but I don't see it.
Every month I get a copy of Foreign Affairs magazine,
which is the magazine of the Council on Foreign Relations.
I view it as a kind of evidence of deep neurosis in the U.S.,
because every issue is a proclamation of America's continued and enduring primacy.
Every article is a self-confirmation.
We're still number one.
We're always going to be number one.
We're far ahead.
China's collapsing.
But I view this more like a Rorschach test or a psychological profile
than I do a deep analysis of international relations.
Jeff, just before we get more into the region here,
you've laid out this very compelling argument about sort of the dollar,
the development and the economy and the rise of BRICS and China.
But in this larger competition for global hegemony,
the question of the military side,
so just the sheer number of military bases,
the amount of money that the United States in particular puts into its military,
we see it in the region.
Every time we hear the U.S. is withdrawing from the region,
we see it coming back in big force,
in part because of, I don't know, we can talk about it later,
but the special relationship with Israel, whatever that is,
but also in the Gulf region and others,
and trying to make sure that China doesn't come in,
make sure maybe Russia itself also doesn't come in as much.
What is the relationship between just the military,
the sheer military side versus the more economic development kind of side?
How interconnected are they?
Which is more important?
The military side is fundamental.
It is itself based on economic and technological prowess.
I would say most of the breakthrough technologies,
I'd say most of the breakthrough technologies of the last 75 years
in the United States were military based.
I was thinking,
why do we have such shitty trains in the U.S.
where you can't even reliably take a train from New York to Washington
without it breaking down someplace?
And it's because the military doesn't care.
And so we don't put in the technology that China has put in,
for example,
for its nearly 50,000 kilometers of fast rail.
The military just doesn't care about this in the United States.
Where it does care,
well,
we've had the internet,
we've had the digital revolutions,
we've had microcircuitry,
we've had remarkable technological advances,
almost every one of which has been originated by the Defense Department
in the United States.
This is quite interesting.
God forbid we should spend some money on human civilian purposes,
but we're told by our libertarian-minded politicians,
that's a waste of money.
But if we spend it on the military,
it's salute the flag and get the money spent.
And there are civilian spillovers as well from it.
But it is the mindset,
which is nothing is too good for the military.
So ultimately,
it is the military,
because you look at the Middle East,
who is on the U.S. sides,
where the U.S. has military bases.
It's regimes that feel that the U.S. is protecting them.
Protecting them from what?
From other countries,
from their own citizens,
who knows?
But in any event,
it's where the military bases are.
What enables the U.S. to have those military bases?
Well,
$1.5 trillion of security spending per year.
If you add up the Pentagon,
the CIA,
Homeland Security,
the other intelligence agencies,
veterans,
and so on,
you're at about $1.5 trillion a year.
That's a lot.
By the way,
it's within reach of China,
and it's not a unique number.
Of course,
Russia can't match it,
though Russia is no slouch at this game.
Europe doesn't try,
because this is part of Europe's system,
to be vassals of the United States
in trade for protection,
a kind of feudal structure
of security relations.
But this power is real.
But in my view,
it's not dominant.
And Russian technology
is really powerful.
And even the Houthis
can send missiles into Israel.
The Houthis.
It's Yemen.
That's not China.
That's not the cutting edge.
The Iranians
have hypersonic missiles.
Pakistan has nuclear weapons.
North Korea
is an extremely sophisticated,
militarized state.
the most recent,
terrifying,
novelistic scenario
of nuclear war,
which I recommend
to everybody
by the author Annie Jacobson
called Nuclear War Scenario,
which is a very
science-based account
of how the world
can end,
begins with a
missile attack
on the United States
from North Korea.
It's absolutely
one of the
plausible scenarios.
And so the idea
that the United States
stands alone
or unique in this
I think is
hugely naive.
And again,
though I'm no
military expert,
I am a,
I think,
a pretty good observer
of technology
over the centuries,
having studied this
for decades.
One of the ways
that the U.S.
and before the U.S.,
Britain projected
its power globally
was not only
the network of bases,
but the Navy.
And the Navy
was deemed to be key
to be able
to move assets.
Well, the Navy,
in my view,
again,
I'm sifting through
the expert opinions
of others,
is hugely
more vulnerable
than it was
10 years ago
because of missile
technology
and space technology.
And these big
aircraft carriers
can be blasted
out of the sea
most likely.
And they were
supposed to be
the whole base
of U.S.
power projection.
So,
I hate the foolishness
of American officials
blithely talking
about war with China
in the coming years.
But my own view is
if we survive it somehow,
because maybe it would be
the end of the world,
but if we survive it,
we'd probably lose the war,
as most war games
have shown.
Jeff,
on this question
about the U.S.
and the Middle East,
to switch to the Middle East
a little bit,
so you've said
that the U.S.
is delusional,
or U.S.
policymakers are delusional
in their view
of, you know,
grand strategy,
in their view
of a unique,
poly world
that will last,
in their view,
forever.
That seems to be
the thinking.
But what if we shifted
to the Middle East
and the perspective
of the Middle East,
where when people
looking from the Middle East
will often say,
well, but the U.S.
is the dominant power.
It has this military capacity
you've talked about
to bludgeon people
into,
or at least to try
to bludgeon people
into submission.
So how does your thinking
about U.S. delusion
square with the reality
that we see
in the Middle East,
which is essentially
quiescent regimes,
the changes in Syria,
the crushing
of the Palestinians?
Yes, and of course
there's resistance as well.
So I'm wondering
how that works in
on the one hand.
And on the other hand,
the question of Israel.
I mean,
is Israel an outpost
of the U.S.?
Or is there something
different about
the Israeli-U.S. relationship?
I think both the U.S.
and Israel
are delusional
about the long term.
It's true.
In the short term,
they can kill
a lot of people,
kick the shit out
of a lot of people.
And the U.S.-Israeli alliance
has been nonstop war.
The best way
to understand Netanyahu
is very simple,
in my view,
which is that
his political movement,
the Likud,
is based on one idea,
never a Palestinian state.
and therefore Israeli control
permanently over the land
from the river to the sea.
And that actually is the charter
of the Likud
from the very start.
The idea that this is
a Palestinian chant,
not an Israeli chant,
is a little bit of the twist
of our narratives.
But it's the Likud
that talks about
from the river to the sea,
of course.
And that's the goal.
Then Netanyahu
came into power in 1996.
And what was the strategy?
The strategy was,
well,
we're going to keep everything.
They're not going to like it.
There will be resistance.
There will be Hamas.
There will be Hezbollah.
There will be
other military resistance.
Don't fight them, per se.
Just overthrow the governments
that support them.
Because as Netanyahu,
I think, rightly said
in the 1990s,
it's not the militants
or what they call the terrorists
that are the ones
that are the danger.
It's their state backers.
War is a big business.
War is not an insurrection.
Sorry.
No matter what people think.
War is an organized state
activity that costs
tens or hundreds
of billions of dollars
and depends on advanced technologies.
War is a big game
of big players.
So Netanyahu's idea was,
well, yeah,
we don't like Hamas
and so forth,
but that's not the real story.
The real story
is the regimes
that back it.
And I have always been struck
by what Wesley Clark
told us many, many years ago
about his visit
to the Pentagon
in September 2001.
Seven wars
in five countries,
in five years,
excuse me.
That list came from Israel.
That wasn't a U.S.
Of course,
Paul Wolfowitz
and Doug Feith
and others
are part of this
strong U.S.-Israel
right-wing alliance.
alliance.
And the seven wars,
Lebanon,
Iraq,
Iran,
Syria,
Sudan,
Somalia,
Libya.
Now,
we've done the list.
Netanyahu's had
six out of seven so far
and he's gunning
for the seventh.
And he may get it,
the war with Iran.
So that's the basic idea.
It,
I think,
pretty clear.
Most big ideas
don't get hidden
from view.
People like Netanyahu
like to write books
about them,
bragging about
what they're going to do.
And Netanyahu's
bragged about
taking down
the Middle East.
He shows us maps
at the U.N.
of the good guys,
which are the ones
with U.S. military bases,
and the bad guys,
which are the ones
that support
the Palestinians.
And we're just going
to completely
uproot
the bad guys.
Now,
what has happened?
What has happened is,
yes,
they've made a killing field
across the Middle East.
No,
no results
in terms of
really remaking
the Middle East.
I quoted
Tacitus recently.
They made it
a desert
and called it peace.
What have they done?
Is
Lebanon at peace?
Is Syria
at peace?
Is Somalia
at peace?
Is Sudan
at peace?
Is Libya
at peace?
Is Iraq
at peace?
No.
These are killing fields.
These are bloodbaths.
These are not
normal states.
This is the
handiwork
of the United States
and Israel
by design.
But it doesn't
produce the
political outcomes.
Now,
here we are
in the midst
of a genocide
going on
in Gaza.
On the one side,
it is
I can't call it
impressive exactly,
but it is a fact
that almost
the entire world
understands
this is a genocide
and says so
and bemoans it.
And
you have statements
by
every group
imaginable,
by the Arab League,
by the Organization
of Islamic
Cooperation,
by the G20,
by the BRICS,
by the UN General Assembly,
and by the UN Security Council,
but for the US veto
against what's happening.
So
public opinion,
such as it is,
is nearly universally
aghast
at this,
as it should be.
But it goes on
every day.
And this is
part of the
drama
and the mystery.
This is the first
prime time
full video
genocide
in history
where we watch
it every day.
We watch
the gloating
of the Israeli
Defense Forces.
We watch
the genocidal
statements
of the Israeli
leaders.
We watch
the
shameless,
pathetic
performance
of American
politicians.
And one thing
I'll say
on January 20,
at least
I'm going to
celebrate
the departure
of Tony Blinken
and Jake Sullivan.
Biden hasn't
been there
for a long time
mentally,
but these
lieutenants
of his
have really
done a job.
They are
really nasty
or stupid
or some
combination
of the two.
So
all to say
what does
this add up
to?
Well,
you can kill
a lot of
people,
but in the
end,
this is not
making,
even forcing
a long
peace.
And I
don't believe
personally
that Israel
survives this.
I think
it could
survive
and should
survive,
a two-state
solution.
That's what
I've advocated
for decades
and what I
continue to
advocate,
even for today,
knowing all
of the
practical
challenges.
But I
don't think
it survives
as the great
regional empire
in the Middle
East.
Zealots
have a real
way of
self-destruction,
and this is
zealotry at work
in Israel.
But when you say
Israel can't
survive, Jeff,
do you
mean it as
are you
talking
ideologically,
ethically,
morally,
or since
you're talking
about power,
do you
mean in
terms of
what it's
doing now
will ultimately
be unsustainable
in the
medium to
long future?
But I
should define
my terms.
I'm saying
if we're
looking ahead
a quarter
century from
now, will
greater Israel
be the
reality?
Meaning, will
there be a
state of
Israel that
controls all
the land from
the Jordan
River to the
Mediterranean,
parts of
Lebanon,
parts of
Syria?
if these
people have
their wish all
the way to
the Euphrates,
because that's
what it says in
Genesis, do I
believe that
that's what the
Middle East will
look like in
25 years?
No.
But why do you
assume that the
Israelis want
peace as
opposed to
domination?
They don't
want peace.
Exactly.
That's the
relevance of
tacitism.
They made a
desert and
called it
peace.
Right.
They don't
want peace.
Or they
want peace on
their terms.
But in
the end,
Israel will
not determine
the state of
affairs of the
Middle East,
nor will the
United States
alone, though it
thinks that it
will.
in the end,
it just won't
be a
Jewish state
acting as a
regional empire.
It's not in
the cards.
It violates
too many
international
laws, too
much global
opinion.
too much
even primitive
ethics not
to kill
tens or
hundreds of
thousands of
innocent civilians.
Most people
believe that,
actually.
We agree with
you 100%.
the world agrees
with what you're
saying.
But the
question is,
when you say
two-state
solution,
could we push
you a little
bit on that
and ask you
why, after
all that has
passed,
should anyone
advocate for...
I mean, the two-state
solution, in a sense,
is gone because the
Israeli colonization of
the West Bank and
Jerusalem is so
extensive.
Why not advocate
for a single
state, given the
fact that we're
talking about
hypotheticals here,
a single state where
everyone has equal
rights?
Why should anyone
be advocating for
two states, one of
which would still be,
in theory, a
supremacist state?
Because we are
one vote away
from a two-state
solution that
could end
killing.
It wouldn't end
this question of
whether the two
states should become
one state, whether
there should be a
federation, whether,
in the end, it
will become one
state.
And I think that
it may well
become that way.
I have no problem
with it myself
becoming that way.
But I believe,
in political
terms, there
was a vote,
basically,
170 in favor of
two-state solution
in the General
Assembly, and a
few opposed,
essentially, the
U.S., Israel,
Micronesia,
Nauru, Paraguay,
Argentina, and
depending exactly on
the vote, sometimes
Czech Republic and
Hungary, sometimes
not.
In other words,
about 95% of the
world has said
two-state solution.
The G20 this year
said it.
The BRICS said it.
The OIC said it.
The Arab League
said it in Bahrain
last year in
Riyadh.
The United States
is, from a
juridical point
of view, the
only blockade
to that.
Not Israel.
Israel cannot
veto two states.
I am not
calling for a
peace process, by
the way.
We've had a
peace process for
57 years.
I'm not calling
for a peace
process.
I'm not calling
for negotiations
between the
Palestinians and
the Israelis.
that is the least
relevant, conceivable
approach.
I am calling for
the United States
to change its veto,
to be aligned
with international
law, global
diplomacy, and
the overwhelming
opinion of the
American people.
So this is what
I'm calling for.
Now, what does
that mean in
practice?
With a sovereign
Palestinian state
on the borders
on the borders of
the 4th of June
1967 with
control over the
Islamic holy sites
with the capital
in East
Jerusalem, it
means that
there will be
a state of
Palestine and
a people of
Palestine and a
place for
Palestinians to
live.
Will it mean
eventually one
state?
It could very
well, by the way.
It could mean a
confederal arrangement
in the future.
It could mean two
states that hate
each other for the
next 30 years, but
don't kill each
other.
But to my mind, it
would mean the
end of this
Israeli, I don't
know, so many
words come to
mind, but this
zealotry and
this militarism
with the world
saying no.
No more
Likud, no.
There's going to be
a Palestinian state
whether you like it
or not.
This is not your
choice.
This is about
international law,
and this is about
peace for all the
rest of us.
Thank you.
And you just
have to live with
it.
Sorry, Jeff, can I
just to push you a
little bit more on
this?
I mean, from
where I stand, there
seems to be a bit of
a contradiction,
because we're saying
that there is
delusion and that
we have this U.S.
now under Trump, but
under Biden and
Trump.
And you've argued
for a long time that
there's this kind of
continuity, especially
when it comes to the
Israelis and it comes
to the Middle East.
So on the one hand,
the U.S. is getting
even more pro-Israeli
officially, not in
public terms, but in
official terms, more
weapons.
Even now, Biden is
sending another $8
billion.
Even now, it's sort
of as a goodbye gift
to Netanyahu.
Even now, to this
day, we have this,
you know, we have
the kind of Trump
appointments that are
coming in are, you
know, these
evangelical types,
these people that
believe in greater
Israel, people that
all of this.
On the other hand,
you're still coming
back to saying, well,
we need to go, we
need to get the U.S.
to remove its veto.
What is it that's
changed?
I mean, how are we
defining it and
analyzing it so
incredibly well and
so realistically, in a
sense?
And at the same time,
coming back to a
policy that says, okay,
but still, we're going
to ignore all this and
we still want the ideal
solution, which I agree,
most people in the world
might want that.
But if the U.S.
continues like this,
where do you see the
change that's going to
get the U.S.
to remove its veto?
If you ask me, is what
I'm advocating likely to
happen?
No.
So, you know, I'm
perfectly prepared, as I
have been throughout my
whole life, to say what I
believe, even if I don't
think it's likely to
happen, because I think
it's the right thing to
do.
So I just want to
clarify, I'm not making a
prediction that this is
about to happen.
It might.
The argument I'm making
inside the U.S.
is that Donald Trump wants
to make America great
again?
Well, maybe the first
step would be American
sovereignty, because I
don't believe any of this
has been in America's
interest.
In other words, this
isn't some great
accomplishment of the U.S.
to have led to $7
trillion of debt and
mass bloodshed and
diplomatic isolation
of the United States
through six wars that
Netanyahu has called
for.
I'm trying to say this is
not in America's
interest.
It also happens to have
the, let's say, the
added feature, which
doesn't matter very
much, I admit.
But the American
people don't want us
to continue being
accomplices to Israel's
genocide.
I say that it doesn't
much matter because
America is not a
democracy in any
operational sense when
it comes to foreign
policy or much else, by
the way.
It's a highly corrupted
plutocracy.
But when it comes to
foreign policy, it's not
even remotely a
democratic institution.
We're lied to every
day.
There's no deliberation.
There's no attempt to
discern the public
views of issues.
None at all.
It's completely in the
hands of the National
Security Council and the
CIA.
We don't know, again,
whether the president's
been in the loop on much
of anything for a long
time because he's
mentally, at least
partly, incapacitated.
But my point is, this
is not in American
interest.
So it's a glimmer of
hope.
If you ask me, is it
more likely to say, yes,
we'll have two states,
then to say this coming
year we'll go for the
one-state solution, I
would say yes.
But maybe I'm playing
with numbers that one
has a 10 percent or 5
percent or 3 percent
chance and one has a
0.01 percent chance.
So one may be much more
likely but still highly
unlikely.
But I'm trying to go with
something that at least
has a chance this coming
year to stop the killing,
stop the bloodshed, put a
floor under what is now
a Palestinian freefall.
Also, by the way, you
know, look around the
Arab world.
Of course, some states are
still in diplomatic
recognition of Israel,
which I can't really
understand.
I find that this was the
time to break diplomatic
relations, in my view.
Genocide is a good reason
for that.
But they didn't do it.
And they didn't do it
because the U.S.
military bases are there
and for other reasons that
we've talked about.
But even those states say
two-state solution.
Some of them say it
actually pretty firmly
right now.
Now, if the Arab world
maybe this, I don't know
if you'll laugh or cry
or whatever, but if the
Arab world actually got
its act together and said
we have leverage, you
know, we've waited a
hundred years for that.
It hasn't happened yet.
But if it did happen, that
really could change things,
by the way.
If Donald Trump heard
clearly from the entire
Arab world, and it's not
impossible, look, don't
play games anymore with us.
Don't bribe us with your
F-35s.
Don't bribe us.
Don't talk about the
Abraham Accords and what
it's going to mean and try
to pull us apart one more
time.
Our position is the
following.
And that's our position.
And accept it or don't
accept it, but that's our
position.
We've taken it to Beijing.
We've taken it to Moscow.
We've taken it to
Brasilia.
We've taken it to South
Africa.
That's our position.
You know what?
That would actually make a
difference.
It would make a difference.
Sorry, part of, I mean, so
much of what you're saying
here is so admirable in
terms of, you know, pursuing
a noble ambition of peace
and so on, you know, and
obviously we share that.
We share that ambition
towards peace and justice.
But part of what's
happening, and you put your
finger on it, too, is
there's also increasingly a
gap between U.S.
popular opinion and the
policymaking establishment
run by the lobby in
Washington.
Our last guest before you is
John Mearsheimer,
incidentally.
So we're talking all about
this.
But the crisis we see on
our campuses, you're at
Columbia, I'm at UCLA.
I mean, I think our
campuses are, I mean, I know
your campuses is like, you
know, fenced off from the
world now.
Our campus is essentially
patrolled by riot police.
This level of suppression
that's going on now, it
seems to me that more and
more people are aware of
what's going on at the
popular level, certainly on
college campuses.
So isn't this the best
moment to say what we want
to pursue is what we really
believe in, at least what I
really believe in.
And I think my brothers
share this too, is a one
democratic and secular
state where all citizens can
be equal.
And like, why don't we, like
if we're pushing for an
ideal in the face of
viciousness and violence and
genocide, why don't we push
for a true democratic, just,
you know, equality for all
kind of situation rather than a
two state solution that we all
know is, is gone.
It's the, and even if it,
even, even if it were
realized, it would still leave
the refugees out of the
picture.
It would leave the
Palestinian citizens inside
pre-48 or pre-67 as second
class citizens.
So, yeah, I don't know what
you think about that.
I have no problem with
that.
I'm, I'm taking a different
approach, but it's a
perfectly reasonable approach.
You're saying, uh, my
approach is, uh, again, all of
it is against the odds, your
approach, my approach, believe
me, it's against the odds.
You know, it too, but my
approach is change one vote
because it's in the U S national
interest to change that vote.
Uh, and, uh, go with the fact
that we are with, uh, the
overwhelming, overwhelming
sentiment of humanity, uh, to
act now.
So that's, that's why I'm
taking the approach that I am,
but I, uh, understand what
you're saying completely.
I don't disagree with it
either.
Okay, Jeff, I know, uh, um, I
know we need to wrap.
Um, it's interesting now, as we
record, we have Amos Hochstein,
who's in Lebanon, uh, Biden's,
uh, mediator supposedly for the
and what's interesting is that
he's of course, an Israeli
citizen too.
So he's an Israeli American and
that you can't make this up.
You can't make it up.
I mean, it's, it's literally
very, it's, it's almost
impossible to understand where
American policy starts and where
Israeli policy ends.
And it just seems to be
literally embodied in Amos
Hochstein.
And, uh, and when he comes in,
it's sort of, uh, Douglas
Fythe and Paul Wolfowitz,
so many, many others along the
way.
That's right.
So, um, so, um, so
you know, let's, let's hope
that, that, uh, you know, what
we're ending with, in a sense,
but I think that the point I
would make is, uh, I'd make a,
a, a, a, a general point about
American politics that I think
is worth making this, uh, strange
fact that Israel captured American
foreign policy is not, um, unique
in the American political milieu.
America, American power is, uh, for
the buying basically.
Uh, and not only on the question of
the Middle East, but on the question
of, uh, the health sector, on the
question of, uh, the military
industrial complex more generally on
the question of big ag on the
question of finance.
And the American system is a very
interesting system.
It's a, an extraordinarily
plutocratic and, and corrupted
system where money buys you, uh,
ownership.
Our government basically is now owned
and operated, and it'll be
interesting to see it's owned and
operated by Silicon Valley this time
around.
Uh, this is the big, uh, purchaser.
They basically have the big prize.
Okay.
It's a, it's a dynamic sector of the
U S. Uh, it's, it's quite
interesting.
On the other hand, it's increasingly
in, in line with the military also.
So I have a lot of worries about it
that maybe we're seeing Orwell
completely come, uh, to life this
way and, uh, the version of
Palantir and others, but, uh, you
buy American policy.
Um, and by the way, at a pretty low
cost, it's not like a pack, for
example, spends all that much money.
Uh, you know, a hundred million
dollars is pathetic.
These people are so cheap, so
unbelievably cheap for now.
It's probably a half a billion that
you need.
Uh, you buy tens of billions of
dollars of armaments, you buy whole
wars out of this for nothing.
I mean, you can't get leverage like
this almost in any other business
venture in the whole world.
So at least I'm, and the American
people are really sick of it, by the
way, uh, they know, you know, do you
trust your government?
Hell no.
Uh, do you trust the Congress?
Well, 10% say yes, but that's because
10% will say yes to anything you ask.
Uh, but nobody basically trusts the
Congress at all.
Uh, do you think politicians act in the
American interest?
No.
Then you go to specifics.
Do you support American foreign policy
in the Middle East?
No.
Uh, and so on.
What's the lesson?
Well, one lesson could be, you know, if
you're an investor, buy into it.
Uh, if you're a forecaster, understand
it.
Uh, if you're, uh, you know, uh, kind
of, uh, uh, an academic, uh, who wants
to dream that something could get
better, uh, at least point out, this is
really screwed up.
This is not making America great.
This is not even, uh, allowing America
to be sovereign.
Uh, this is not in our interests.
It's not in our security.
It's making the world a lot more
dangerous attack Iran.
Yeah.
Brilliant idea.
Next step to world war.
Uh, especially, uh, Iran and Russia will
sign a security agreement on, uh, January
17th.
All right.
Great stuff, BB.
Tell us, uh, your next genius move.
Uh, you've already created so much
destruction, uh, all through your region.
So all I'm saying is, uh, we should
understand, um, arguments about what's
right and wrong, legal, not legal, uh, in
American interest, not in American
interest may or may not be relevant at
all, but at least for me, it's just
about the only thing I have, uh, is, uh, to
try to say, this makes no sense.
We need to do something different.
Professor Sachs.
Thank you so much for, for joining us
on this podcast.
We really, really appreciate all your
insight and look forward to listening to
all the other podcasts.
Uh, we know that you do this regularly, so
we look forward to, to, to following up
on you on this.
Well, great to be with you.
Thank, thanks so much.
Thanks for such an interesting.
Okay, guys.
I thought this was a really interesting
discussion with, uh, with Jeff Sachs.
Um, I know we, we, we were pushing him
towards the end, especially about the
question of Palestine and the question
of two-state solution versus, I don't
know, one state or, or whatever one
wants to call that.
Osama, I know you were, you had
something, what, what is it?
What do you think?
Well, I mean, I agree with you.
I thought it was a fascinating
discussion.
I thought it was, uh, you know, there,
there's a kind of, uh, at the macro
level in terms of de-dollarization, in
terms of U.S.
global hegemony, in terms of the, the,
the unit polarity and the myths of U.S.
unit polarity lasting forever.
I think that is, you know, he's very
strong on that.
And then when it comes to, to Palestine,
obviously, as he said, he said, there's
a genocide going on.
It's awful.
We all agree, of course, about that.
But then the solution is a two-state
solution.
And I kept thinking, you know, um, so,
so incisive at one level of analysis.
And then it, it struck me as, as more
sort of idealistic in a certain kind of
way of a two-state solution.
Yeah.
But he admits that no longer, that's the,
that's the, in other words, his, he's
very clear, like for him, the two-state
solution is not something that's a
practical or achievable thing because
of all the obvious.
So when I was talking about the one-state
solution, he said, yes, that's, you know,
but for him, it's like this.
But he said, that's your point of view.
It's not, but the point is, it's, it's
like, yeah, it's what I'm saying.
He recognizes that.
So for him, the two-state solution isn't
so much an actual solution.
It's rather something to say, can we go
along the way because it's one step,
it's one step.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Something better.
Yeah.
Because the UN, Karim, right.
This is your, your bailiwick in the sense
that the UN, the international, so the
international community has overwhelmingly
endorsed this so-called two-state solution.
Karim, so my understanding is that he's
saying, well, let's, that's, that's the,
that's the least.
That's what Norman Finkelstein also says,
by the way, Osama.
That's always Finkelstein's line is that
there are laws backing the two-state solution.
There's nothing in favor of the one-state solution.
No, but this is true.
This is true.
The simplest thing.
Yeah, but that doesn't, so, but so what?
No, let me, let me just say, in other words,
from, from somebody who's, who operates
within the policy world, which is where, you
know, Jeff Sachs is, right?
He's, he's always on that level.
He's dealing with leaders all over the world,
all across the world, from China to the
global South, to the West, to wherever.
So when you, when you're saying, okay, what
is the simplest possible solution at a, at
a practical policy level?
It's all you need is the U.S.
to, to kind of remove its veto, to accept
Palestine as a state.
How do we get to that?
That's it.
How do we get to that?
That's what I'm saying.
That's it.
That's literally, there's nothing else to be done
except for this one country to change on that.
That's it.
I see that point, Karim.
I see that point because it's also, you know,
you can see how, and the thinking, you can
see very clearly, this is the least, this is
the least, what is it?
There are the fewest obstacles in the way, right?
It's not, that's the idea.
One obstacle.
It's the back of these.
One obstacle.
There's one obstacle.
That's it.
So then that begs the question, or that leads
to the question about.
Well, there's Rando Wattu too, don't forget.
No, but there's veto.
It's a question of the veto.
But it begs the question about like, what
happens?
How do you get that shift to occur in U.S.
policy, given his analysis that the U.S., you
know, policy making is, is completely, he
said, he said it's captured by the, by the
pro-Israel lobby, by the, by AIPAC and company.
As he says, all of U.S.
politics is, you know, so we go back to the
Mir Sharma, Walt, you know, story about, you
know, U.S.
U.S.
policymakers are bought and sold by endless
numbers of lobbies in many different fields.
But in, in the Middle East, it's, it's AIPAC,
obviously.
Although, by the way, it's interesting.
His, his emphasis wasn't so much on AIPAC.
It was more individuals within the U.S.
government.
When Karim brought up Amos Hoxstein at the
end, you know, he said there was, what's his
name?
Wolfowitz, the architecture of the Iraq war.
But he said AIPAC in terms of the, the, the, the
return on investment.
Yeah, they, they work together, obviously.
But it's more.
I mean, you're talking now, Elon Musk is on a
rampage.
You're talking about Zuckerberg.
You're talking about all these people that
control large parts of social media.
You're talking about the attacks on TikTok in
the United States, because a lot of young
people were, were, were, were using TikTok to
get live streaming of the genocide.
The lobby said it must go.
Exactly.
So, and, and all this becomes clear.
So it's, it's not just AIPAC per se.
It's that whole, that whole kind of constellation.
And I think, I think what he was, what he was
suggesting at the end, and what, what I think
we always talk about here is that there is a
shift in the public discourse.
There's a shift in the public opinion, not
discourse, in the public opinion in the
United States.
And that, that at some point, hopefully will
have some kind of bearing on, on, on the
U S obstacle in terms of removing its veto or
not beyond that, that's where we got to.
Yeah.
That's where we got to with our discussion
with John Mearsheimer last week.
I mean, he's not Palestinian, he's not
Palestinian.
So he, you know, he's not going to say, well,
you have to, you have to pick up guns and
fight and, and, you know, there are other
ways to do it.
That's fine.
I understand.
But can we, can we just, just wrap on this
point about, look, you're in Beirut right
now and you're surrounded by people.
I'm sure, given the media that we're
reading, you're surrounded by people who
are like Hochstein, you know, gloating and
crowing with the sense that victory has, you
know, been achieved, you know, right.
Am I wrong about this?
And so I'm wondering, how do you reconcile
that view in the region?
Um, especially among the more conservative
forces that are allied or tied or subordinate
to the U.S.
How do you reconcile that view with his view
that, that the U.S.
is delusional?
I mean, that's what I, that's, that to me,
I'm just keep trying to, I struggle with that
all the time.
It's, it's a short term.
I think that, I think the idea is a short
term versus a longer term thing.
I think that you, it's very easy.
It's, it's not difficult to say the Israelis
won and the Americans won in this sense that
Hezbollah was defeated and Iran is weakened.
And, you know, of course this is, I mean, at a
certain level, it's pretty easy to say that.
And they're making use of that to try to shift
from this kinds of what, what appears to be
certain kinds of military victories into a
strategic ones or political ones.
And that hasn't happened yet.
So what I will point out is of all the gloating.
Yeah, there is gloating in, in, in a lot of
circles in Lebanon that Hezbollah was, there's
not so much of the pro Israelis that they, they
want to see the kind of ending Hezbollah as a, as
the main force inside Lebanon.
That's true.
On the other hand, Hoxstein did come in and he
did give a speech today or his press conference.
And he did say, the Israelis are going to
withdraw and the Israelis have said the same.
So you're in this thing where within that 60
days within the truce, if the Israelis do
withdraw, what, what is the implication to you?
The implication is when you look at Syria, you
look at Lebanon, you look at these countries, you
see, and look at the West bank, you look at
Gaza, you see that the country that resists, and
this is Lebanon in particular, let's say, the
Israelis withdrew.
In Syria, there was no resistance.
They've taken it and they've expanded.
And there's no way that the Israelis are going to
withdraw. Forget the Golan Heights.
I'm even talking about Mount Hermon and the other
places that they've taken.
When are these guys ever going to withdraw?
In Lebanon, they're going to withdraw.
At least I think they are.
And so what does that tell you?
So yes, you can go on the gloating all you want, but
on the ground, you can also see that there was a
certain, there was a, if you don't want to say military
victory for Hezbollah and the resistance on the ground
in the south, you can certainly say the Israelis
absolutely failed to achieve their main military
objective, which was to destroy Hezbollah militarily
speaking, not in the kind of ground, not in leadership and
decapitating and killing the Salah, all of which were massive
blows. Don't get me wrong for the larger political and
strategic things, but on the ground, in terms of the
military, they did not win in the south and they were unable
to advance beyond a few kilometers from the borders, no
matter what the propaganda was going on about.
They simply, even in Qayyam, they were unable to really
push through it.
So you're talking about a country like Lebanon, which was
able to resist the Israeli military through the eighties,
increasingly through the nineties, in 2000, there's
liberation, 2006, the Israelis did this massive attack.
Ultimately, like it or not, they were unable to achieve any of
their objectives in the 2006 war. Hezbollah gets stronger.
And then that's, that's part of their demise.
Ultimately is the fact that they became too big, too strong.
They went to Syria, they grew, they became a massive bureaucracy.
And so they were infiltrated more.
They were, they were, there was more corruption inside.
There was all sorts of things.
And this is the things that they're going to be dealing
with right now, but in Lebanon, in the core military
resistance part in South Lebanon, they held in a sense,
the barbarians to bait.
They did that.
And they, and, and so with all the gloating that takes
place, we cannot forget that that is a fundamental aspect.
And if anybody, and I've had this discussion with people here,
if anybody thinks that the Israelis would not have occupied
South Lebanon or at least large chunks of South Lebanon, one
needs to only look at Syria today to see that that's just,
it's, it, that is delusion, utterly delusional.
Not just, that's just, not just, I agree completely.
It's not just, they've also been talking about Southern
Lebanon since the 1950s.
For a hundred years, no more, for a hundred years.
No, no, but like that's, that's, you know, in textbook,
I'm talking about in terms of policy, they've long wanted to
occupy South Lebanon, South Lebanon, take the water, install
the puppet government in Beirut.
Like this is like going back.
They wanted, they wanted, they wanted, they wanted the borders
of Palestine to be at the river.
The, the, no, no, I understand.
Palestine borders.
That's, that's a hundred years ago.
I'm agreeing with you.
I'm, I'm completely agreeing with you.
I would also add, by the way, same thing in Gaza for all the
devastation that they've inflicted out of the people of
Gaza, they are unable to accomplish their prime task, which is,
which is destroying or eliminating Hamas.
They've been, so in other words, they have a, we've said this
many times on this, on this podcast, they have a capacity to
inflict massive harm, but that does not translate, necessarily
translate into the attainment of political objectives.
That's what Jeff was talking about when it comes to the U S they
can kill millions of people.
That doesn't mean they win.
Right.
So we have to disaggregate the infliction of harm from the
accomplishment of military or even political objectives.
I think that's important to bear in mind.
Yeah.
I think that's a, this is a good place.
I think it depends.
I think, I think it depends also on the, on the timescale we're
using, because at a certain sort of timescale, you could say
that, that what he was talking about, Jeff was wrong when he
said that the Arab states have never used their leverage.
It's not true.
I mean, they did try it.
I mean, they tried it once they tried 73, not just 73.
They tried, but also they, no, they, they, they were part of a
UN block.
They, they did vote in the four fifties and sixties.
Come on.
Yeah.
But that was not true that they didn't, they didn't.
I mean, by the way, also the Arab peace plan, I mean, like it
or not, that was the Arab attempt to, to, to, to reconcile what
they saw as a reality and say, okay, let's just deal with it.
67, two states.
And they were ignored completely.
And they were, and they were ignored completely.
But the point is that there was this leverage in the past.
And the question is, how do we get back?
I don't know.
I, I feel that there's, um, there's so many different levels
of analysis that, that we're operating under, but from a U S
perspective, you could say that the Arab position has been defeated or
was, you know, in terms of a shorter, like if you take it from
where the Arab states were in terms of their discourse in 48 versus
where they are today, you could certainly say the U S has quote
officially one, but it hasn't of course, eliminated resistance.
And the whole point is that resistance keeps generating
because the conditions are so fundamentally unjust.
Does that make sense guys?
In terms of what are you talking about?
Yeah, but if we go, but if we connect this to the first part
of the conversation with Jeff, if you say also some of the threats
to American economic power, which, which is the basis
of its military and political power, which are coming, you know,
at some point that also raises questions for how long can it, can the U S
literally, how long can it afford to do what it's doing?
And, and hence how long can, yeah, I know that's what I'm saying.
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the global economy
and the threats that are coming from bricks, et cetera, all the stuff
Jeff's was talking about, and it's also inside the U S the, the change
in public opinion, uh, across the board, even among evangelicals,
young evangelicals are saying, yeah, exactly.
Nothing, nothing is a done deal.
Nothing, nothing is steady state here.
This is like one last point.
Is that it?
I think one last point then this to respond to Osama as well,
is that one lesson I've drawn is not that, that is that the Israelis
are actually very, very weak without the United States.
The Israelis would not have been able to do anything.
Absolutely not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, nowhere.
It's absolutely, this is more than ever.
The Israelis, not even protecting themselves from Iran, they were unable
to protect themselves, no, like that whole missile, missile, the missile
from Iran, but I'm talking even October 7th, we're talking about what
they ended up doing in Gaza would not have been done without, without the
United States, without Biden in particular, and Blinken and Sullivan, who
just gave them another $8 billion, by the way, that's right.
Just right now, that's right.
This is the definition, guys.
This is a definition of a Pyrrhic victory for the Israelis, insofar as
No, no, like they're, they're gloating about their victory.
It's how Pyrrhic is it?
And when you say that Hoxstein was gloating, this is all Pyrrhic victory stuff.
Yeah, Hoxstein, by the way, but with the human cost, unfortunately.
Oh, obviously, obviously.
Yeah, Hoxstein was last seen at Starbucks, getting and getting a coffee at Starbucks
and some Lebanese going and telling them, oh, no, please, you don't pay here.
We're Lebanese, we're, you know, hospitality.
We don't, we don't let anybody pay any guests pay.
So, you know, the country is split in that sense.
Before we wrap, I just wanted to ask our listeners, our audience, please, if you could give us
