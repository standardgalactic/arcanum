What I find most terrifying about what's going on
is this sense that even if he is not
a kind of fully-fledged Russian operative,
if he were, he's pretty much operating
according to their playbook.
That's pretty terrifying.

Welcome to The Rest is Politics with me, Alistair Campbell.
And with me, Rory Stewart.
And Rory, I think partly because most of our media
hasn't bothered with it,
we should talk about the China,
the National Congress that they've just had,
and China more generally,
because I think it's been some fascinating stuff
coming out of China.
We're going to talk about Russia,
and I think you've got some things to say
about the kind of Russia-Ukraine situation.
But in the context of the sort of broader politics there,
I think we should talk about Syria
and the violence that's erupted
in the coastal areas of Syria.
So let's start with China.
The reason why I wanted to talk about China
is we're in this world
where we all sort of tell each other the whole time
there are really only two superpowers in the world,
the United States and China.
And the United States,
we cover and we discuss, as included,
every aspect of everything that's happening
inside Donald Trump's White House.
So when we talked to Michael Wolff on leaving this week,
we're even talking about the woman,
the name of the woman who sort of walks alongside him
carrying his bags and, you know,
knocking the dandruff off his suit
and all that sort of stuff.
And yet China has just had this,
what they call the two sessions,
which is the National Congress
and also the big advisory body outside.
And it's as if it didn't happen.
I've actually been the last few days
asking people if they're aware of anything
that's big that's been going on in China
in the last few days, and nobody knows.
And then the other game I'm playing is,
I won't do it on you, Rory,
because it's too cruel.
I say, name the seven members
of the Chinese Communist Party
Politburo Standing Committee,
who are probably the seven most powerful people in China.
Okay, now Xi Jinping, we all know him.
But the rest of it,
I guess most of our listeners won't know.
So is that a consequence of us not,
is it a language thing?
Is it the fact that Trump just literally
does flood the zone with shit?
And we kind of, as Peter Hyman says,
we go around poking in the turds and deciding
how much to talk about this one
before he drops the next one?
Or is it that we maybe haven't fully caught up
with just how important China is now
in terms of our lives as much as their own?
It's a lot of those things, isn't it?
And you're completely right.
I mean, let's start with how right you are.
Yes, why not?
That's always a good place to start.
Given that China is definitely
the second largest economy in the world,
and in some calculations,
already the largest economy in the world,
and it's the only country in the world
that remotely has the opportunity
to balance the US.
It's astonishing that we have
sort of reporting on it.
One issue, of course,
is that it's a much more centralized
authoritarian system,
much more controlled,
Xi Jinping-led system.
And it's opaque,
even for very, very good foreign journalists.
It's quite difficult
getting into the depths of what's happening.
It's much more like
the sort of criminology of the 1980s,
where you're endlessly finding,
you know,
some small clue
for something that's said
in the people's daily.
But that's why this
two-sessions event is so important,
because the media
are allowed to attend it.
You're also absolutely right
that often what's said
in these big congresses
and in Xi Jinping's main speeches
turn out to be much closer
to what's going to happen
than you can believe.
I mean, let's take one example of that
to confirm your point.
China laid out an industrial strategy
10 years ago,
and what it said
is our industrial strategy
is we're going to try
to dominate effectively
the world of renewable energy,
batteries, electric vehicles.
We're going to shift towards more tech.
We're going to focus on chips.
We're going to do AI
and we're going to do quantum computing.
And 10 years later,
broadly speaking,
they've done that.
There are still some challenges
we can get into on chips and AI.
There is a sense
that it's a government
that indicates where it's going
and what it wants to do.
Again, the Belt and Road Initiative
wasn't a sort of secret plan,
very, very formal plan
that they laid out.
So what did you take away, though,
from your observations
to the congress
or what you could pick up from it?
The first thing is how hard it is,
if you're not there,
actually to find out
what's going on.
And I don't think
that's just because
of the China command and control,
complete control of the media,
et cetera.
I think it is because
a lot of Western media
just doesn't find it
interesting enough,
even bother to try
to find out what's going on.
The point you just made,
I think, is the right one.
What is so interesting about it,
if you do read their speeches,
and I'll come on to Wang Yi,
the foreign minister,
who did this amazing
press conference
with lots of different
sort of things that he said
that really were genuinely
quite interesting.
But there's one thing
I read in one of the,
I think it might have been
a Chatham House analysis
of something,
but this was from
an earlier congress,
and it talks about,
just listen to this,
for Xi,
the achievement
of the China dream
would be a two-step process.
From 2021 to 2035,
China would seek
to transform itself
into a great modern
socialist country
through economic development.
Then, from 2035 to 2049,
China would continue
a path of national rejuvenation
to become what Xi describes
as a global leader
in terms of comprehensive
national strength
and international influence.
So, here we are
following the Trump presidency.
The kind of time span
is from tweet to tweet
or from tantrum to tantrum.
And here you have
the Chinese Communist Party
literally setting out
a strategy
that takes you to 2049.
And as you say,
although they've got
economic problems
and Li Qiang,
the prime minister,
when he set out
the economic report,
because they also do
an economic report,
you know,
it's not like our budget,
but it is an economic report
where they set out
military spending,
future welfare spending,
and so forth,
is that the way
to understand
how they work
is to try to get inside
this longer-term mindset.
And that's why I think
we're missing a trick
in both in terms
of understanding
how they operate,
instead of which,
what you have
is essentially
the Americans
just seeing them
as this enemy
and everything
being in that context,
as opposed to,
well,
what are they actually
trying to do
and how do we fit into that?
One of the themes
we'll get to
with Russia,
but it's true of China too,
is this thing
that Owen Matthews,
who's a Russian analyst,
calls the kind of
Schrodinger cat problem,
which is these places
are described
both at one hand
as these sort of
extraordinary,
powerful giants
and simultaneously
as these sort of
very weak minnows,
and the narrative
sort of shifts
between the two.
But in China,
of course,
the narrative
for the last couple of years,
particularly since COVID,
has been that China's peaked
and that particularly
the collapse of the property sector,
which was nearly a quarter
of the Chinese economy,
and you may have seen
these incredible images
of cities
with footprints
larger than London,
completely empty,
property companies
going bankrupt,
a lot of people's assets
tied up
in mortgages
that have gone underwater.
So property,
tech,
again,
Xi Jinping moved
against people
like Jack Martin,
and these amazing
Chinese tech companies,
Alibar,
Tencent,
et cetera,
and that dampened
the tech sector
and then he began
locking up quite a lot
of people
in the finance sector
and it remains
a more oppressive regime
even than Russia
in terms of its
sort of state control.
So the story was
if you combine that
with the population
of China dropping
and for the first time
the population of China
dropped by 10 million
last year,
people begin to say,
well,
maybe China's bubbles burst.
And this has been
a story that we've heard
really for 25 years.
There was a very famous book
written in 2001
which said China was over.
It's a book by Gordon Chang
where he said,
you know,
it can't really work,
authoritarian states,
state-owned enterprises.
So here are a couple of things
though to put in the other direction.
So on the one hand,
yes,
there's big economic problems.
There's a lot of youth unemployment,
a lot of people at home,
a lot of restaurants have shut
if you go to Shanghai or Beijing.
On the other hand,
as you've just pointed out
in this People's Congress,
China is projecting growth rates
of 4.5%,
5%,
double the amount
that would be pretty good
in the United States.
It's real growth rate
and its nominal growth rate
is likely to be
significantly higher than the US,
maybe a third higher,
maybe twice as high.
And defense spending 7% rise.
And defense spending 7% rise.
So what's the other side of the story?
And I guess the other side
of the story
are a couple of things.
One is that
some of the movements
that China made
against these tech giants
maybe don't look so foolish.
Now you see the domination
of people like Musk and Bezos
in the United States.
Why did they do it?
Well, basically,
because these companies
were becoming semi-monopolies
and not necessarily
for good liberal reasons,
but because the Chinese Communist Party
didn't want to lose power.
They did not want Jack Ma
taking over all of e-commerce
and the entire banking system
and basically bullying
the Chinese government, right?
So having sat on them,
shut them down,
moved them out of politics,
there's now a little bit of move
from the Chinese government
to re-embrace tech.
And there have been
some pretty considerable successes.
So DeepSeek,
this amazing AI model,
which is challenging
ChatGBT,
you know, generating stuff
cheaper, quicker,
even if some of it is nicked,
which is the allegation,
is an example of that.
It's also possible
that their industrial strategy,
although very wasteful,
so they obviously,
it's very opaque.
We don't know how much money
they spent on it,
how they subsidized it,
but it's a pretty amazing
economic model.
So look at the electric vehicles.
What they did is they began
by spraying subsidies
at nearly 2,000 companies.
But there's an odd combination
of kind of subsidies
and then the law of the jungle
takes over
and then these 2,000 companies
fought it out
and two or three of them
have emerged
as incredible global
electric vehicle leaders
producing vehicles
that are third cheaper
than American or European equivalents
and just as good.
Just while I'm briefly on the cars,
I'm sure we all share
the grief and the pain
of Elon Musk
as he watches
the share price of Tesla
plummet
and discovers that
maybe projecting yourself
as a kind of hard right
uber fan of Donald Trump
isn't good for business,
but we'll see.
You said there about
the law of the jungle.
That was a phrase
that actually appeared
in this press conference,
Wang Yi.
And the only reason
I know this, by the way,
and here's another thing,
National Public Radio,
that's where I found
this account, okay?
That's the one that
Trump and Musk
want to shut down
because it does
really boring things
like think there might be
more than one side to a story.
So anyway,
just to go through
some of the headlines,
the headlines they put on it
was that he talked about
Trump's two-tier
hypocritical approach to China.
On the one hand,
tariffs.
On the other hand,
we want to have
closer relations
and that was the sort of headline.
But just to go through
some of the things he said,
he talked about
American relations with America,
which he said were
bad and getting worse.
Tariffs,
really, really bad idea,
but if they happen,
we will fight back
very, very hard.
Fentanyl,
why are we getting the blame
for your problem?
I sent you this quote,
Rory,
because I just thought it was,
and I said to you,
who do you think said this?
And you would give me
all sorts of different names.
But the answer was
Wang Yi,
who said this,
imagine if every country
prioritised itself
above all else
and placed blind faith
in power and status.
This world would regress
to the law of the jungle
where smaller and weaker nations
would bear the brunt
of instability
and the international order
and rules-based system
would face severe disruption.
I mean,
you could imagine
Reagan saying that,
you could imagine
most current European leaders
saying that about Trump.
So what this is about
is they're sort of
watching the instability
and they're watching
the sense of chaos.
And as ever with the Chinese,
they're thinking,
how do we exploit this
and how do we
turn this to our advantage?
So,
and then he went on,
he started,
he talked about China
as being an anchor
of stability
in an uncertain world.
And this is almost
like they're saying,
you can't trust America
for stability at the moment.
So you've got to look to us.
And I thought it was
a really interesting Congress.
The theme of the thing
was confidence.
And they do do
economic presentations
where they sugarcoat it
to some extent,
but they talked about
some of the economic problems,
the youth unemployment
and the problem that they had.
They actually talked
about these huge job fairs
where young people
are trying to get work.
But I just feel
that sometimes
we underestimate.
The reason why I find
them so interesting
is because,
and I know it's a dictatorship,
so it's easier for them,
but they really do have
a sense of long-term strategy.
And I think that's,
well, that's absolutely
what's missing
from America right now.
Listen,
let me just sort of quickly
jump to the defense
of some good journalists
on China.
So Tom Orlick,
who's the Bloomberg
chief economist.
Yeah, listen,
there are.
I'm not criticizing
journalists who are there.
I think it's more the fact
that the people in it,
where they're,
headquarters are,
they don't find it
interesting enough.
Another shout out
to a friend of mine
called Jeremy Page,
who's with The Economist,
who is just the most
incredible example of,
he almost feels like
an anachronism now
because he's like
a surviving example
of a traditional journalism
we're almost losing.
So Jeremy speaks
really good Chinese.
He speaks good Russian.
He's spent,
and he's barely been back
to the United Kingdom
in 30 years.
He's been just
Russia,
China,
India,
and has went
from the times
and is now
one of these
kind of absolutely
classic examples.
I praise
Xiaxianq Joshi
sometimes from The Economist
for his work on defense,
but Jeremy really,
you know,
is in there.
And he's one of the guys
that's pointed out
that I do at least know
some names
in the Chinese setup.
There's a man
called Lu Xiaoye,
who was the Chinese
ambassador to France,
a big wolf warrior
who created lots
of controversy,
being derogatory
about Baltic states,
has been appointed
as their super envoy
for Europe.
And it's quite
an interesting appointment,
just happened
a few weeks ago.
And he is really
trying to do
all this stuff
of reaching out
to Europe,
saying Europe
should have a say,
Ukraine and Europe
should be involved
in the negotiations
between...
Oh, that was a big part
of Wang Yi's
press conference,
is Ukraine has
to be involved,
Europe has to be involved.
We want peace,
but not peace
at any price.
This is why
it was so interesting.
And when you think
that, you know,
there's Marco Rubio
on his way to Saudi today,
and there's a BBC
correspondent
on the plane with him.
No, that's fine.
That's exactly
as it should be.
But his opposite
lumber in China
saying some really,
really interesting things,
none of which I've seen
pretty much anywhere
in our media.
The traditional story
about China,
20 years ago,
it was they're really good
at sort of copying
and imitating,
but they'll never be able
to build the components
for an iPhone.
Well, guess what?
Now, basically,
iPhones have built in China.
So the surviving claim
as of six months ago
was, yeah,
well, they're very good
at stuff,
but there's three things
they're never going
to be able to do,
and those were supposed
to be chips,
commercial airliners,
and AI.
Well, they've really
jumped forward with AI.
Chips, it's still true
that they're struggling
on some of the most
advanced stuff,
but they can do
really good second,
third level chips,
which is allowing them
to fly much cheaper
and pretty effective
fifth generation
fighter jets now.
Yeah.
There's still a question
about whether they're
going to be able
to get into
the building aeroplane space,
and that's a really
interesting space
where, in fact,
the real heroes,
which we don't talk
about enough,
are Europe.
Absolutely.
Because nobody
would have bet
on Airbus being able
to take on Boeing.
In fact,
if Airbus had failed
to take on Boeing,
you could have provided
a good story of,
you know,
Europe's taking weekends
off and spending
too much time
having summer holidays
and, of course,
America won.
And actually,
the truth is,
Airbus is now
much more advanced
than Boeing
with a lot of its systems.
I mean, 737s are
kind of 1960s
and summer technology.
So let's see if China
can get there
on planes,
but my guess
is they will
and that it's
very, very short-sighted
to assume
that they're not
going to be able
to get there
with planes, chips,
and I think
they're already
demonstrating
they can get there
with AI.
The other area
that Wang Yi
and some of the
other presentations
looked at
was this whole
business of America
scrapping
international development
and aid,
USAID.
His quote was,
unacceptable self-interest
at the expense
of others.
Gaza,
Trump's approach
will make things worse,
not better.
It was, I felt,
a very clear attempt
at repositioning.
Now, we shouldn't
overlook the fact
that, you know,
you've got,
it's utterly repressive,
no real freedom of speech,
the Uyghurs are treated
absolutely appallingly,
but what I sensed in this
and, you know,
I'd love to know
what your guy
The Economist thinks
because he obviously
knows millions
more about this
than I do,
but am I reading
too much into it,
you might ask him
in saying that
this felt like
a sort of
strategic repositioning
seeking to exploit
what they are now
perceiving as
the potential
for chaos.
And of course,
the other thing
that is always
at the back
of their minds
is Taiwan.
I know you want
to talk about,
maybe this is a good
link to Russia
because what he said
about their relations
with Russia,
he said,
they are steadfast,
a constant
in an uncertain world,
not a variable
in geopolitical competition.
In other words,
they are very much saying
they are aligned
with Russia.
They've had these
military exercises
this week
with Russia and Iran.
This is, I guess,
just a plea
to the serious media
in the UK
and Europe
and America
is I think
we need to learn
more about China.
We need to see China
other than through
the prism of
it's a dictatorship.
And the other thing
about gerontology,
you know,
we talk a lot
about American politics
as a sort of
gerontocracy.
The other thing
I hadn't realised
about the Politburo,
Xi Jinping accepted
because he's an exception
in so many different ways.
You have to leave
when you're 68.
So they've got
this constant
sort of conveyor belt
coming up,
bringing up new
slightly younger people
who become the rulers.
Xi Jinping is out
on a class of his own.
Taiwan is very interesting.
There's big problems
within the Chinese military,
huge corruption scandals,
their competence
is being called
into question.
And there is
a strong argument
at the moment
for Xi Jinping
that he doesn't need
to move against Taiwan now
and that the smart money
in China
is on waiting
for Trump
to self-destruct,
that they can just
sort of sit back
as it were
with the popcorn
and watch the movie
of the United States
and Europe
ripping themselves
to pieces
before they have
to make any decisive moves
or take any risk.
On Ukraine,
there was a very
interesting question
from somebody
last week
on whether China
could step in
as the peace guarantor
in Ukraine.
But I think China,
again,
is very reluctant
to do that.
They haven't engaged
in a military conflict
since 1978.
They don't have
the full confidence
yet in their foreign service
and their military
to do that kind
of security guarantee.
And then I think
there's your final point,
which is even as things
collapse with the US,
it's very,
very difficult
to trust China.
I mean,
the massive uptick,
not just in espionage
and funding for universities
that we've talked about,
but uptick
in Chinese cyber attacks.
You've talked about
the size
of these tens
of thousands
of people now
sitting in Chinese
cyber attack facilities,
something we discussed
in a podcast earlier,
and their alliance
with Russia.
I mean,
that's probably
the most important thing
that we've sort of
touched on today
is your point
that in this Congress,
they're describing Russia
as a stable status quo power
when in fact,
we in Europe
would see it
as an extremely
destabilizing power
undercutting
global norms
and laws.
So, I mean,
I think in a way,
China missed a chance
by getting so strongly
behind Russia,
keeping the Russian economy
going in that way.
They missed
a strategic opportunity,
which India missed as well,
to align strongly
with Europe.
And they would have been
in a much stronger position,
both India and China,
to say,
okay,
Trump's gone off
in a crazy direction,
we'll make an EU-China
or an EU-India alliance
if those countries
had been firmer
and clearer
in allying with Europe
against Russia.
But does that not mean
that they actually would,
it would suit their interests
for America
to stay locked in
to what's happening
to Ukraine,
rather than force America,
as some in America
want them to,
to choose between
China and Russia?
You can either
see China as the enemy,
or you can see Russia
as the enemy,
you can stand by Ukraine,
or no,
you go towards
China's enemy.
And I think there is
this debate going on
inside the American
administration
as to whether they should
focus on Russia or China.
Absolutely.
And I think you're
completely right
that the basic way
of describing US foreign
policy at the moment
is there are the
total isolationists,
which is we want to
stick to the Americas
and we don't care
what happens to the rest
of the world,
and then there are the people
who are the prioritizers.
We do care about the world,
but what we care about
is China,
and we don't care
about the rest of the world.
But you're also totally right
that China's money
is all on
just sitting back
with the popcorns
and watching the movie
of America
and shooting itself
in the foot,
undermining its alliances,
and they don't really need
to get involved
in any of these places
because Trump's doing
all their work for them.
Let me just tell you
what Donald Trump said
in one of his 78
press conferences this week.
He was asked
whether these military drills
between Russia and China
and Iran are of concern.
He says,
no, not at all,
because we're stronger
than all of them.
We have more power
than all of them.
I rebuilt the military.
That's not bad
considering he's only been
there a few weeks.
Unfortunately,
Biden did nothing with it,
but we don't even want
to talk about it.
He just did.
I think if you look
at what's happening,
let's see what's happening
with the Russia-Ukraine thing.
I think in the near future,
you're going to have
some pretty good results
coming out of Saudi Arabia.
So there we are.
There's strategy
at its finest.
So Russia,
you've been looking at Russia.
Yes, absolutely.
So I've been talking
to Peter Pomerantsev,
whose book,
Nothing is True,
Everything is Possible,
you've praised
in the podcast in the past.
I praise it every time
I talk about Russia.
Talking to Owen Matthews,
who's another very
long-standing Russia analyst,
very interesting things
happening as they try
to struggle to work out
what to do with this
new world with Trump
or delight in it.
Essentially,
what's happening
is that as America
seems neutral
or even pro-Russian,
the target is shifting
to Europe.
One of the things
that we will now see
is a very,
very coordinated
hybrid social media campaign
run by the Russian
intelligence services
to do all they can
to divide Europe,
talk up far-right parties
in Europe,
create scandals in Europe,
undermine Europe's commitment
to defending Ukraine.
It'll be an absolute barrage,
not just of information warfare,
but of personal attacks,
trying to discredit journalists,
discredit politicians,
use Western politicians
who Russia's close to
to undermine them.
And we do not begin
to understand what's coming.
And Peter Pomerantseff
is saying that we need
to begin to learn
from the Swedes
and the Finns.
Some of this defense budget,
this enormous defense budget
that Stalmers announced
needs to go into
political warfare,
in other words,
information warfare.
It's not that enormous.
I mean, 2.5 to 2.7
in the long-term three,
when the polls are already
talking about 5%
and even the Germans
are sort of changing
the rules on which
their economy is run
in order to sort of
boost defense spending.
The other thing
that they exploit
are what, you know,
sometimes they call
the useful idiots.
You know,
the reason why
some of these
information warfare campaigns
are successful
is because the ventilation
often comes
from people who are
on the receiving end.
In other words,
if Britain
or let's say France
or Germany
during the election
when the AFD
was getting boosted
by Russia,
it was boosted
then by Musk
and then people
who follow Musk
and see Musk
as a kind of
American libertarian
on the right,
they don't even think
that they might be
helping Russia
in what they're doing.
So what I find
most terrifying
about what's going on,
and I think we're doing well
not to be talking
too much about Trump
because I think people
are sick to death of him.
But just one point
about Trump
in this context
is that I think
what most people
are finding
so difficult
to handle at the moment
is this sense
that even if he is not
a kind of fully-fledged
Russian operative,
if he were,
he's pretty much
operating according
to their playbook.
That's pretty terrifying.
There's nothing
that he could do
at the moment
which wouldn't be
exactly what they wanted.
I mean,
I was thinking about this,
that if you wanted
to design the most
cunning KGB SVR campaign
to discredit
the American president,
that short clip
which he shared
on Truth Social
of Gaza
with dancing girls
and gold statues
of Trump
would be the most
perfect propaganda
way of discrediting Trump,
and he's sharing it himself.
The other thing
that's interesting
is that, of course,
it was Russia
that in the 2000s
pioneered the idea
of politics
as a reality TV show.
Broadly speaking,
Russia's been through
three transitions
under Putin.
The Putin that
you first met
when your friend
Tony Blair
was saying,
I think this is someone
we can do business with,
so the late 90s,
early 2000s,
Putin.
Now, let me just
correct you,
that was Thatcher
on Gorbachev,
what Tony actually said,
I think this guy
is going to be okay.
That was what politely
could be called
the managed democracy phase,
and that was a really
interesting moment
where from the late 90s
into the early 2000s,
they had this sort of
carnival
of very, very
extreme
parties,
statements,
played out on TV,
played out in the newspapers,
where basically Putin
sailed through the middle
with oligarchs
funding lots
of mini parties
with more mad positions
than him
in order to undermine
the communists,
and that was a reality TV moment.
Then there was the shift
to the kind of hybrid regime,
and then finally
the shift to the sort of
more totalitarian state
that we see now.
But it's still weird.
I mean,
it's not 1984.
It's not that you
can't say anything.
If you're a Russian economist,
you can go to
academic conferences
and you can say
that we're too reliant
on China strategically,
there are these
telegram channels
where the different
Russian security services
fight each other.
So the FSB,
the SVR,
the GRU,
and the presidential
administration
will have their own
telegram channels.
There are certain things
they're not allowed to say,
right?
They're not allowed to
attack fundamentally the war
or attack fundamentally Putin,
but they can generally
have a go with each other.
And you saw a bit of this
with the Prigozhin
attacking the central command.
Yeah.
But what ultimately happened,
and I guess this is where
your Trump analogy
becomes interesting,
is that what began
as spectacle,
what began as sort of
reality TV,
what began as kind of
provocative nationalist
talking points,
finally,
people began believing
their own rhetoric.
The mask kind of stuck.
And the big example
of this was that
when the first noises
came at the end of 21,
beginning of 22,
particularly from the CIA
saying,
we think that Putin
is actually going
to invade Ukraine.
You know,
we can actually see
mobile crematoriums
moving up to the front line.
Almost every real Russian expert,
including many,
many people in Ukraine,
said it's not going to happen.
He's always saying
stuff like this.
You know,
he's always saying
he's going to invade Ukraine.
Don't worry,
this is just part
of the reality TV.
This is part of the show.
And then it turned out
that in the end,
he believed his own rhetoric
and the tanks rolled in.
Discussing this,
all this with your people
in Russia this week,
what were they saying
about the economic situation?
Because what you were saying
earlier in relation to China,
you were essentially speaking
about our kind of confirmation bias.
We tell ourselves
that the Chinese economy
is not doing so well.
We tell ourselves
they're falling apart.
And I was just reading a piece
on the conversation this morning
by a guy called Julian Cooper
from the University of Birmingham.
And he's suggesting actually
that the Russian economy
is proving to be
a lot more robust
than we expected.
The budget spending
on the military
but also on big
infrastructure products
and transport links
with China and so forth.
And they're doing things
like giving better maternity payments
because they're absolutely
petrified of the low birth rate
at the moment.
Two stories.
So on the negative side,
demography is against them,
their population is shrinking,
it's aging.
There are real problems
with inflation,
big, big problems
with inflation.
And a lot of the chat
in Russia
that you pick up
is not political.
It's economic unhappiness
with the way
that inflation is going
and the way
that interest rates
are much too high.
And you can see stories
of people not pulling supplies
to the front.
And there's a lot of distortion
towards the military economy
and towards the border
with China
but many other parts
of the country
being neglected.
On the other hand,
you're absolutely right
that the Russian economy
has not been crippled.
And that's partly
because although we stopped
taking Russian gas
in Europe
at huge cost
to our own economies,
Russian oil
still flows everywhere
including in Europe.
China and India
in particular
have been big,
big buyers
and kept that economy afloat.
The defense spending
and it's difficult
to know what percentage
of GDP they put in.
As you know,
some estimates are
if you look at the whole thing,
it may be as much
as 40% of their economy
directly and indirectly
connected to defense
is providing a stimulus.
And our sanctions package
has never been precise enough.
Too much of it,
unfortunately,
has been quite symbolic.
Again,
we're not serious.
And this may all
become irrelevant
because Trump
may be about to lift sanctions
and welcome Putin
into the world
and get his economy
off the ground again.
But if we were really serious
about sanctions,
you would have a unit
thinking morning,
noon and night
about targeting
a dozen tiny bits
in the system.
Ghost ships,
transfers through UAE,
Indian oil buying,
a new company
popping up here.
And that's not the way
that we've been doing it.
One of the figures
we're missing here
desperately
is Alex Navalny,
whose widow
we interviewed on Leading.
Because he was
somebody who really
understood the regime.
He was the target
of unbelievable
relentless abuse.
And, you know,
that's where you really
see the kind of abuse
that went against
Hillary Clinton
during her campaign
or the abuse
against Soros.
But Navalny in Russia
experienced it
like the power
of a million.
You know,
he was accused
of being a kind
of MI6 stooge
and also a Kremlin stooge.
He was accused
of being a Nazi
and also a communist.
But he knew
how to fight back.
And he did it
by combining
panorama investigations
to corruption
with brilliant
social media campaigns
that kind of hit them
where it hurt
and really knew
where the regime
was in pain,
which is why in the end
they had to murder him.
You mentioned the oil
there and the ships.
And the other thing,
which again,
there's so much
awful stuff
coming out of
Trump's mouth
and administration
at the moment.
But the other thing
that was just unthinkable
even a few years ago,
Canada through the G7
trying to
bring together
fresh action
against these Russians,
the shadow fleet,
these ships
that are sort of
trailing around the world,
helping people
break sanctions,
shipping oil
around the place.
And America vetoed it.
And we're back
to the point of,
well, who does that help?
That helps Russia.
Doesn't help America.
It certainly doesn't
help the G7.
So, you know,
we are at that place.
And this is why I think
Merz in the statements
that he's making,
Macron, Tusk,
Keir Starmer,
who I think rightly
is still trying to
hang on to the idea
that we can
keep the Americans
on board,
but they're all of them
preparing for the possibility
that this isn't just
sort of Michael Wolff
saying,
you know,
Trump's,
this is just the latest
episode in his
reality TV show,
that this is actually real
and it's incredibly dangerous.
As we step up,
as Europe steps up,
we have got to be ready
for the Russian assault
from every direction
in information warfare,
propaganda,
social media,
what's going to happen
on Twitter,
what's going to happen
on Facebook.
Europe is going to have
to somehow be ready
and have the units
to fight back
because it's going
to be horrible
as they try to tear
into our democracies,
support pro-Russian
far-right groups
and do all kinds of stuff.
So this is just the beginning.
Right, let's talk about Syria.
So just a sort of
quick update on this
because this is,
if you want an example
of where the modern world
of social media
and fake news
and mad stories
and personal attacks
take off,
you cannot find
a better example
than Syria.
The amount of confusion
around what's actually
been happening
in Syria
is unbelievable.
So as far as anyone
can piece it together
and people are beginning
to try to put it together now.
So we're recording
on Tuesday.
Last Thursday,
there were attacks
from the Alawite community
against the new government
and the Alawites matter
because Assad's regime
was at its core
very dominated by Alawites.
he came from an Alawite family.
The Alawites are
a traditionally persecuted
fringe Muslim religion
which was not always
recognized by Orthodox Muslims
as being Muslim at all
because it has
various secretly
satiric rituals
and were treated
as second-class citizens
under the Ottoman Empire.
Over the last 50 years
since the Assad regime
has been in place,
they have been considered
by the regime
as their core loyalists.
So they staffed
the intelligence services,
the senior ranks,
the military.
A loss of the brutality
and torture
over the last 15 years
has been conducted
by these people.
And this regime,
of course,
collapsed.
Collapsed a few weeks ago
as this very surprising
sweep to victory
of Ahmad al-Shara,
who we interviewed together
in Damascus,
former Al-Qaeda commander
in Syria,
took the country
and the regime collapsed.
At which point
these senior members
of the regime,
the Alawites,
retreated mostly back
to their own
traditional community places
in Latakia
and in the mountains
along the coast.
And there was a big question
and the big question
is very, very similar
to denazification
or debathification
in Iraq,
which is the questions
that we actually asked him
at the time,
which is,
what do you do?
Let's say somebody
was a general
in Bashar al-Assad's forces.
Let's say he was running
torture cells.
Let's say he was caught
in the intelligence service.
Do you make them sign up
for an amnesty,
pay them a salary,
bring them back
into the modern forces,
in which case
a lot of your own supporters
say you have got to be kidding.
These people have got
to be brought to justice.
They have blood on their hands.
Or do you say
these people cannot be brought in,
can't be trusted,
leave them on the margins,
in which case
you have heavily armed
former regime elements
starting an insurgency.
And fast forward,
basically the story was
that on Thursday
there were attacks
against government forces.
Some people say
up to 40 coordinated attacks
against army barracks
and hospitals.
The government responded,
but as the government responded,
other people got involved,
freelancers, militias,
combinations of people
coming down from Idlib,
individual Syrians
coming in on motorbikes.
Some people connected
to the Syrian National Army
in Turkey
and they conducted
horrifying attacks
against Alawite villages
in which at least hundreds,
maybe as many as a thousand
people were killed,
including civilians,
including in some cases
women and children.
So we have a situation
where suddenly
the whole regime,
which has been
in a very sensitive position,
you know,
as we said
when we did our interview,
the odds are against Ahmad al-Shara,
because he's having to deal
with the Alamites
and the former regime,
he's having to deal with Kurds,
he's having to deal with ISIS,
he's having to deal with Israel,
he's having to deal with Turkey.
All this stuff
seemed as though
it was coming
completely unbuckled
just at the moment
he was trying
to get sanctions lifted.
And of course,
the social media campaign
has been,
we always told you so,
this man is an extreme
Al-Qaeda terrorist
and he has instructed
his Takfiri jihadists
to massacre minority communities.
And in particular,
there was a huge emphasis
from people like Marco Rubio
on the killing of Christians,
although there's very little evidence
that hundreds of Christians
were killed.
In fact,
the Syrian observatories
yesterday were suggesting
that the number of Christians killed
may have been three.
What you're essentially saying
is that
something
truly terrible
has taken place
and that
some of the government forces
who are
loyal to
the current administration
have been involved
in some of that,
but that actually
the overall picture
is much,
much more complicated.
Is that your kind of
basic point?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And he's facing,
Ahmed al-Shar is facing
two problems.
He's facing the problem
with what to do
with the Alawite community
and the former regime elements,
but he's also
facing the problem
of what does he do
with his own people
and his own allies.
So he ran
al-Qaeda Syria
and then he created HTS
which brought in
other groups,
but there is
all these other
armed factions
and he's trying
to bring them
into the army
and one of his big challenges
is there are tens of thousands
of armed Kurdish fighters
that he's trying to
incorporate into the military.
Now, ultimately,
this is all his fault
in the sense that
he is the head of state,
right?
He should be controlling
these people.
But when we were
interviewing him,
we were saying
how are you going
to be able
to balance
your vision of Syria
which he says
is of a moderate
multi-ethnic
or multi-sectarian Syria
against the fact
that you have
these very extreme supporters
who were pushing
for another vision.
Can you control them?
How do you navigate
all those things?
And I think
that's what's coming apart
and at the bottom of it
is money
because if he had money
and he doesn't have money
because of US sanctions,
but if he had money,
he would have the money
to pay the salaries
of the Alawites
so the former regime elements
might be less liable
to go into rebellion.
He could pay his own people.
He could get oil going.
He could get civil service salaries going.
He could deal with the fact
there is serious poverty
and economic crisis
now unfolding in Syria.
And he can't do any of that
despite the fact
the Katshari's have offered
to pay the cash for salaries.
The Turks have offered
to bring in barges
for electricity.
The Saudis have offered
to bring in oil.
But none of them can do it,
neither Katshari's,
the Saudis nor the Turks
because of American
secondary sanctions.
Trump is stopping this.
And also he said,
if I'll go into some detail
through this interview
that Al-Shah did yesterday
because it's an interesting example
of sort of leadership communication
if you want to put it like that.
But one of the points
I was going to make,
but I'll make it now
because it speaks directly
to what you've just said.
He essentially says
that they've had pretty much
no contact from the Americans
since the fall of Assad
and since he's been there.
It's a very interesting thing.
So when we interviewed him,
as you recall,
he was quite nervous
and quite diffident at times.
Sometimes he had to
slightly struggle to hear.
But as we said afterwards,
saying a lot of the right things
because he was trying to speak
to beyond Syria
to a Western audience.
And he's done something similar
on the back of this.
So he's done an interview
with Reuters,
which is apparently
the first interview
that he's done
with one of the big
global news agencies.
And the headline,
New Syrian Leader Says
Killings of Alawites
Threatened Unity
and Vows Justice.
Now that is,
that is again
saying the right thing.
Okay.
And he goes on to say
the mass killings
of members of ousted
Assad's military set
were a threat
to his mission
to unite the country.
He promised to punish
those responsibly,
including his own allies
if necessary.
Quote,
Syria is a state of law.
The law will take its course.
We fought to defend the oppressed.
We won't accept
that any blood be shed
unjustly
or goes without punishment
or accountability
even among those closest to us.
Now, of course,
the risk with that
from his perspective
is it plays into the narrative
that this is all about
revenge attacks
upon the Alibites.
And as you were saying,
that may be partly
what's involved
but it's not
the whole story.
But just on what you saw
when we were there,
what do you make of that
as a response
to what's going on?
You call in Reuters,
you do an interview,
you try and land
a very clear message
that you want to be
for the whole country,
not just for your own supporters.
Is that enough
or should he be doing more?
Well, it's definitely
a good thing.
He's also rung
one of the Alawite mothers,
mothers and one of the victims,
to apologise personally.
He's set up
a formal investigation commission
to go in
and look at what's happening.
But boy,
is he in a difficult situation,
partly because of his neighbours.
So Iran used to,
was what propped up
Bashar al-Assad's regime
with Hezbollah.
Obviously,
Hezbollah was destroyed
by Israel
and the attacks in Lebanon
and that collapsed the regime.
And as Iran retreated,
all the oil
that Iran used to provide
has stopped flowing.
Iran now has a direct interest
in undermining
the Syrian regime
and causing chaos there.
Israel appears
to have concluded
that its interests
are best served
by a failed state in Syria
and seem to be doing
all they can
to undermine
and destroy
Ahmad al-Sharah's regime
because they consider him
to be an al-Qaeda terrorist,
they consider that
he hasn't changed
and they think
he'll eventually
be a threat to Israel.
So you've seen Israel
conducting continual bombardments
against military positions
in Syria,
so much so
that I can hardly believe
they have any targets
left to hit.
They've also seized
bits of Syrian territory,
they've announced
that they will take
the Druze
into their occupied
bits of territory.
They're positioning themselves
as champions of minorities,
which is a very odd
position for Israel to take
given their other positions
in the Middle East,
but they're saying
they're now speaking up
for Alawites,
speaking up for Druze,
speaking up for Christians
and they are absolutely
leading the campaign
in Washington
to say on no account
can sanctions be lifted.
They want Ahmad al-Sharah's
government bankrupt
without any cash,
collapsing
and they want to
fragment that country.
And it's really interesting
the fact that we did
an interview
and this goes back
to your point
about how
the way social media
operates,
the way polarisation
has happened.
So, for example,
the Telegraph yesterday
did their picture
to illustrate
the 1,300 deaths,
whatever it is,
was a picture of you
and me with al-Sharah.
It was one of the best
pieces of guilt
by association
I've ever seen
in my life.
And we've been
receiving both,
I've passed on
some of them to you,
I haven't passed on
them all
because we've just
been inundated,
but people who are
sending us
accounts
of massacre,
videos
of some
of the killings
that are taking place.
And some of it
is from people
and organisations
you sort of feel
like you can trust
because you know
their reputation,
but others of it,
it reads clearly,
it reads well,
but you don't 100% know.
And then on the other side,
we had this,
I forward you
a message I got
from Netanyahu's office,
essentially saying,
pointing out
that the foreign minister
of Israel
had said
this all underlines
why your interview
with Al-Shara
was very ill-judged
and very badly timed.
So somehow
that was a sort of dot
painting the picture
towards what's going on now.
I still defend
the interview
on the grounds
that if somebody
goes from being
a terrorist
to finding himself
now
as the recognised
leader of Syria,
then it is,
to my mind,
a bit crazy
not to want
to talk to people
like that.
And that doesn't
just go for being,
for us doing a podcast,
even more it goes
for people
who are running
the big governments
of the world.
It's extraordinary.
Above all,
you know,
we would be
perfectly willing
to interview
Steve Bannon,
Vladimir Putin,
Donald Trump,
Bibi Netanyahu,
anybody else
who wants to come
on our show.
The fact that we
interview somebody,
that's our job
as forms of journalists,
which is to give voice
and let people hear
from other people.
But I think we provided
a very, very fair
balanced summary
on his Al-Qaeda links,
on his past.
There was nothing
naive about it.
And most of the stuff
that's happening
on social media
is really, really interesting
because what you can see,
and look,
this is not about
being self-centred
about the attacks on us,
although it's been
pretty amazing.
Thousands of attacks
on us accusing us
of supporting Al-Qaeda
against massacring
Christians and this
and the other.
But look at where
those attacks are coming from.
They're coming,
some of them,
from UAE-based accounts,
and the Emirates
is very, very angry
that they feel
that they've been left out.
They tried to back
Bashar al-Assad
at the end
and feel very unbalanced
about what's happening.
Attacks from Russia,
obviously,
because Russia
was a back of Bashar.
Attacks from Iran,
obviously.
But increasing attacks
from people
close to Israel
who are using this
as a way of saying,
well, you criticize
what's happening in Gaza,
but why are you not
criticizing these attacks
against Christians
and minorities?
Then, of course,
the right in Europe
and Britain.
That's why the Telegraph
will pick it up.
Musk has again
been spreading
incredible fake news.
He has been spreading
this idea
that hundreds of Christians
can be massacred
in deliberate attempts
by attack theories,
which, as far as anyone
can see,
simply isn't true.
But Musk just promotes
this through his thing.
And I talked in some detail
to somebody
that we've name-checked
before on the show
who does some really
impressive work on this
called Amil Khan.
And Amil Khan
maps these social media
networks
and their strategies.
And he has this idea
about seeders and spreaders.
So the seeders
is somebody like Elon Musk
that puts the story out.
And then the spreaders
are real accounts
and then an enormous amount
of bots
and non-authentic accounts
who retweet
and put forward these things.
He's done it
in real detail
on things like Sudan
where he's shown
the incredible difference
between the way
that Egyptians
do social media campaigns
and the way
that UAE and Russia
supporting the other side
does it.
Their use of AI content,
their use of video,
which is incredibly popular,
their so-called
citizens journalists
who turn up
on the ground
and film things,
the way that software
is used to identify
how to propagate it.
And this just connects back,
I guess,
to what we were saying
before the break.
We need to brace
for what's about
to happen in Europe.
And the Russians
have got used to it
over 10, 15 years.
Hillary Clinton
has got used to this.
George Soros
has got used
to coordinated attacks
which have come at him
from Russia first,
but then increasingly
from Israel,
Hungary, etc.
But you and I
are just beginning
to touch the edge of this.
In some ways,
it's quite flattering.
It implies that they
want to discredit
and destroy us.
But what's happening
is basically beta testing.
So they want to find
what is the right attack line.
So with you,
it might be Iraq war
David Kelly.
With me,
it will be MI6 officer
running a corrupt NGO.
Why don't you say anything
about Pakistani grooming gangs?
And now on to warmonger
in Ukraine,
supporting Al-Qaeda
and killing Christians
in the Middle East.
But this is them
navigating their way around
increasingly multinationally
with very, very interesting
use of bots
and quite cheap.
The Iranians are supposed
to spend only about $12 million
a year destabilizing Iraq
in this fashion.
And I don't think
we're beginning
to be ready for it.
Yeah,
I had an exchange yesterday
with Carol Cardwalader,
who the journalist
who exposed a lot
of the kind of Russian activity
in relation to Brexit
and got a lot of grief
from all the kind of reform
and right-wing media people
for her troubles.
And I did a tweet saying,
I've always thought
that the kind of
Trump is a Russian asset
was a bit
for the conspiracy theorists,
but it's hard now
not to think
that maybe there might
be something in it.
And basically,
Carol, who I like
and respect a lot,
and she replied,
kind of,
where have you been?
You know,
this is essentially
what we've been saying
and this is what Brexit
was about.
Now, you know,
it is true,
we have never ever,
because of the lack of will
within the last government,
we've never got to the bottom.
And literally,
as I'm sitting here
by my phone,
I was just sort of
looking for Carol's tweet.
I couldn't find it,
but what did pop up
was somebody saying,
somebody called spaceology,
not sure why Alistair
had so many doubts
about Russian interference.
This is a picture
of Lord Lebedeff.
So, you know,
where you're right,
we are pretty,
I think we're a long way
behind the game
compared to what
our traditional enemies
are doing.
And it becomes so much harder
because our traditional ally,
the United States of America,
now looks like
it's more of an ally
of their tradition
and our traditional enemy
than it is of Europe,
which is pretty terrifying.
Pretty terrifying.
Well, final shout out
for real serious
serial analysis.
Don't please
look at Twitter
and believe weird videos
being shared on Facebook.
Two people I'd like
to make a real call out
for who I think
are extraordinary.
Dharin Khalifa,
who works for
the amazing
International Crisis Group,
does the most beautiful,
sensitive,
thoughtful reporting
and knows
the region
really, really well
and is particularly
interested
on Turkey
and what will happen
in Syria
if Syria doesn't manage
to balance its relationships
with the region.
Will it end up
with Turkey
getting involved
in fights with the Kurds
and seizing bits
of territory?
Secondly,
Charles Lister
who has done
amazing work
on covering
the whole story
from the beginning
and really understanding
the roots
of Ahmad al-Shara
and where they're going.
So, yeah,
shout out to the two of them.
Okay.
And Rory,
final point
if we're going to reform
and the feud
that's going on there.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how much do you believe
Elon Musk
when he says
that Ukraine
tried to take down
Twitter yesterday?
I would say
less than zero.
Less than zero, okay.
Less than zero.
But one of the things
that you'll be aware of
is that Elon Musk
has talked openly
about the fact
that he regularly
uses ketamine,
Special K,
this kind of horse
tranquilizer
that people used
to use to party.
He uses it
because he thinks
it helps manage
his depression.
But one of my relatives
had to have
a serious operation
on their hand
and they were put
under ketamine
in the United States.
And so I sat there
in the hospital
and watched them
emerge
from ketamine.
It is unbelievable
what it does
to your brain.
The things they were saying
as they emerged
from this ketamine high,
the dreams they were having,
the fantasies
they were having.
And I don't know
what quantity
of this stuff
Musk is using,
but I was slightly
concerned about the idea
that he's on his social media
accounts
if he's on ketamine.
Well, so I think
we're in danger
of running over.
And I think
let's just finish
with two kind of
really obvious
banal things.
First is
a huge shout out
to these very serious
analysts
who are doing
the detailed work
and will keep
pointing you
towards them.
And I think
the second thing
is what an
unpredictable world
this is.
I mean,
you and I talked
about the risks
in Syria
and we could see
that there were risks
from the Alawites
and risks
from ISIS
and risks
from his own factions
and risks
from the Kurds
but guessing
which one of those
was going to
blow up first
and I think
the story
of the Kurds
in Syria
still needs
to be played through.
Anyway,
thank you very much indeed.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
