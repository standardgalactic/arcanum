Welcome back Orion. Thanks Mark. It's always good to be here. So we've done several talks
now and I just thought maybe we would just wing it. You know, I don't really have anything prepared
but I watch your channel. Every Monday and Friday you post a new video and you've posted
so many interesting little talks. You know, everything from, like you did a beautiful
talk on the difference between a mother's love and a father's love, which was a great talk.
You did the holders and sniffers. That was a fun one. It was about how partners handle...
Well, actually farting in their relationship, which is kind of a trivial problem but I talk
about it more as a metaphor for let's say the unpleasant and distasteful aspects of
our personalities. And I think there's basically two ways to approach it. You can
either kind of hold it in and protect your partner from some of those aspects of
ourselves that just aren't easy to get along with or you tend to just sort of
let them rip and say, hey people gotta love and accept me for who I am and I'm
gonna go for the authentic approach even if it might be a little distasteful from
time to time. And I think those are two radically different approaches to
relationships. And I think that you can have successful relationships both ways
but that you generally have to be with a compatible like-minded person. Like it's
hard for holders and sniffers to get along. The most interesting part of that
talk for me was where you kind of quoted, I think it was a professor that you
knew who said you need to be with somebody who you like the smell of their farts.
Yeah, it wasn't a professor, it was a mentor of mine and that was some advice
that he gave me long ago when I was a lovelorn young man.
Because if you're really in love with somebody you're gonna just accept
everything about them, good and bad. At least tolerate. I think that that's
something that we should stress more in today's day and age is you don't have to
like everything about your partner but you might have to tolerate certain things
and that's okay because they might have to tolerate certain things about you. It's
like everyone thinks their farts smell better than they do to other people.
Have we become too like spoiled? Have we become too spoiled? I think our
expectations are too high. Expectations are too high. In so many different ways. And
one of the most damaging expectations is that our partner should be everything to
us. Like our lover and our business partner and our best friend and our
therapist and our mommy or daddy. And it's very difficult to get even one of
those things discharged well from one person. And so that really puts a lot of
pressure and expectation on relationships. And it's sort of like a chain is only as
strong as its weakest link. And sometimes somebody who could be a great co-parent may
not be a very emotionally vulnerable supportive best friend and that can
create problems. Maybe a wonderful mother isn't a great lover and vice versa. So
it's important I think for people to understand that you can't get everything
from everyone and everyone has something about them that is gonna be less
than ideal. I think the advice to find somebody whose farts you can live with is
important though because some things for whatever reason are just easier to live
with than other things. It's like and I think everyone is has the right to have
his or her own like deal breakers. The things they just really can't stand or the
things that get under their skin and they don't want to have in their
relationships. It can be useful for people to examine where that distaste comes
from but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to force yourself to live with it.
Some things are going to be more charming and quirky other things are going to be
gross and distasteful right. And on some level the practice of love is to accept
the other person for who he or she is and to hope that they also give you the
same grace as well in return. You certainly don't show up to a
relationship hoping to be changed by the other person to be more in line with who
they would like you to be. But people go to relationships all the time
consciously or not to change their partner. Sometimes we can say that it's
well-intentioned like I can see the potential in you right you can be so
much better than you currently are. But on some level that's a kind of a
disrespect to the individual as he or she is and another person might not see
anything wrong with that behavior or that trait. It really is a subjective thing.
One of the other talks you did recently which was kind of addressing what you
just spoke about there's no need to understand the problem which I thought
was great because we're constantly focusing on like let's figure out your
problems let's figure out your problems go to therapy let's figure them out. But
the truth is as you said even if you figure it out doesn't mean the problem
has evaporated it's still there. No there's a couple things about this I think
one of them I said in the episode I've said on the channel before which is that
insight isn't enough and I learned this when I worked for a couple years in my
training at a outpatient chemical dependency clinic and you would see all
kinds of folks come through your doors in that kind of setting and there were
folks who were kind of like frequent flyers they've gone through the system
they've gone through programs multiple times sometimes mandated sometimes not
these folks had been thoroughly therapized like they spoke the lingo better
than I did at that point and they could tell you all about their alcoholic family
dynamics and their shame based self and the chain analysis of what led them to
relapse and how alcoholism from their great-grandfather has been passed down
through the generations and they still drink. So it's like these folks were
sufficiently aware both of their vulnerability factors and the mental
processes that lead them to drink and relapse and yet they continue to do so. By
the same token that same day I could see somebody with a very low insight he would
come into the office and say I want to stop drinking. Why? I don't know I don't like
anymore and he just decides not to put the alcohol in his mouth anymore and he's in
recovery like he's he's getting better that way. What's really interesting about
working with addicts in particular is there are few sectors of mental health
where you can see such profound growth and change in a human being in such a
short amount of time. Like if you can succeed in helping somebody go without
alcohol or meth or opioids for three months like they can become a totally
different person. Yeah I've seen it happen. It's amazing it's so hopeful and
encouraging. Of course the issue is to stay that way right like what's the joke
is quitting is easy I've done it a hundred times. So that's one thing is that
insight is just not enough. The other thing that I haven't said on the channel
but I'll say here kind of a controversial take but that not everyone should be in a
relationship. Not everybody's ready to be in a relationship. Think about it this
way if if you had a broken leg and you were trying out for like the varsity
football team no one would have a problem with you sitting on the bench for a
while. It doesn't mean you'll never get to play but maybe you need to heal your
leg and go through some physical therapy and do what you need to do to get to a
place where you could actually contribute to the team. That's a tough sell when it
comes to let's say emotional or psychological injuries. Sometimes people
think that if it's not visible people should just be able to get over it or
our hearts are Teflon or these folks deserve love and relationships too and I
think that's kind of a tough sell. It's like some people if they've been
traumatized by previous relationships or their childhood or life which it's
obviously subject to happening it happens to lots of folks it's like a
broken leg is that maybe you need to take some time off the field and heal and do
what you need to do to get to a place where you can contribute positively to the
team effort and insisting that you should play in spite of that insult or
that injury to your heart or to your mind I think that just is in spite of
reality on some level does that make sense makes perfect sense yeah and so I
always you know sometimes I think every week I'm dealing with consultations from
guys who are in less than satisfying relationships and they think yeah she
tells me she's still trying to get over her trust issues from the ex that cheated
on her or she had a narcissistic father and and she's working through that and I
was like okay that's good that she's working through that but she's still in
physical therapy like she's she doesn't get a spot on the team yet she's on the
raw she maybe she's on the roster but she's on the what the disabled list or
the injury list whatever they call it so there's no need to go forward with
somebody who's still in the process of healing and it's certainly not I tell
these men it's not your responsibility to make all of these like changes to the
game to accommodate where she is emotionally or psychologically it's like
we're not going to change the rules of football so that people with broken
legs can play and we should be cautious about going out of our way to allow
that to happen just give people some time take six months 12 months heal up get
better and then get back on the field it's not a big deal aren't we often
though finding a partner that might be slightly broken in hopes that we can fix
them up and then make them something that maybe we couldn't get if they were
100% when we met them I think a lot of people do I certainly was that way when I
was younger and I'll speak from my own experience I think I did that because I
didn't have a very high self-esteem I didn't know if I could successfully
compete as a young man against some of the guys who were more accomplished more
attractive stronger on some level I was wondering what a healthy high
functioning woman would want to do with me so on some level I'm as not the
fastest lion I might have targeted the gazelles with a limp you know that's I
was like okay maybe that's my food on some level so and conscious I think this was
unconscious but my thinking was that I will earn my relationship I will earn my
sex I will earn my love by helping this person because what I where I might have
been able to compete even back then was with my mind and with my words and things
that I was interested in that respect so I thought okay I know a little bit
about psychology I know a little bit about X Y & Z maybe I can go in help this
woman because I could see the potential in her and as she gets better she'll
reward me in her gratitude with sex love and relationship and it turns out
that's not usually what happens it's not how it works no so I've discovered
that as I've become more authentically confident and with a good measure of
self-worth in a sense of my own self-advocacy I don't I don't do that anymore but I
think a lot of people unconsciously believe that they're not enough and so they
target partners consciously or not that are also deficient in some way and
expect them to be grateful for doing so you see people in your private practice you
also are living in this world of relationships and everything else that
we're dealing with in life how many people are happy in their romantic
partnerships I don't know man that's it that's a tough one it's like we know
outcomes about like marriage that 55% of all marriages end in divorce only 40% for
first marriages only but 55% overall because you get divorced once you're more
likely to get divorced again but that doesn't necessarily mean that the people
who stay together are happy nor does it mean that the people who separated we're
unhappy like I think that's obviously the case in in in some instances but I
think it's a bridge too far to just make that assumption I can speak from my own
personal experience having been personally invited into hundreds of
people's relationships I can think of maybe one or two relationships families
marriages where I think oh this is pretty nice I could do this the vast
majority of the time I'm there and I'm like I don't know how these people do it
like I could not handle this and that's okay I don't have to right you know but I
don't know I don't know I think in general people aren't very happy and it
doesn't seem like a relationship makes you happier we sure are convinced that it
will though mmm we try so hard yeah people often think relation like a like a
romantic that kind of relationship can make you happier can you chase it until
you are exhausted and you chase it some more a lot of people do that yeah I think
we need relationships like a life without relationships would be very hard I
think Aristotle said that only a beast or a God could live outside of society and
society is formulated of relationships like you have to be so self-sufficient and
independent that you would need nobody which would make you I don't even know
what it would make you or you you're just half feral so most of us need
relationships and they are potentially a great source of our meaning and
satisfaction they don't have to be romantic relationships though I think
friendships are actually more important than romantic relationships in many
respects but we sure do value the romantic ones more well sure they're fun
too you know so many of these kind of relationship gurus which I'll lump you
into that group they seem to focus on how women are aiming for these guys that
are the most alpha or the most successful the most attractive the most all
that but I and you and I have talked about this off nothing at dinner once where I
I think there are women who probably because of some subconscious thing that
they believe about themselves will aim low they will not go for a guy who is the
most attractive the best candidate for a good life a lot of women learn to aim
lower I don't think they aim low but many of them learn to aim lower because
you're right it's in in the beginning like ever since high school most women it's like there's
cliquishness and faddishness about which guys are hot which guys are not and even in
high school there was like three guys of the entire class that it seemed like 90% of the girls were
swooning over right and that that doesn't change all that much especially according to the research it seems like the vast majority of women are all kind of looking at the top let's say 15% of men
that 90% of the women were into is that what you said yeah yeah certainly in with like for example revealed preferences on dating apps yeah and some guys hear that and they despair but I don't believe that that's justified because the top 15% of men is constantly being renovated like it's very hard to be in that top
echelon indefinitely and the men who were there 30 years ago likely are not there today do you see so you get a you get a moment if you play your cards right you get a little lucky and you work pretty hard just like women you know it's like they're most attractive in a season on some level and men can kind of even the odds through hard work and dedication and a little luck over decades potentially
so I don't think men need to hear that stat and think it's never going to happen to me I certainly when I was younger didn't think that I would be where I am today life is long and mysterious okay so
what often women learn though is that those attractive men are awash in optionality and
the research also is pretty clear that men enjoy and pursue casual sex more often than women do and so a lot of men who are in that highest echelon who are getting a lot of female attention I mean why stop the
stop the buffet as it were it's like why settle down with any one woman especially now when everything is kind of coming in hard and fast as it were so that might not be an issue for a younger woman but eventually most women seem to want to have a family and they might eventually despair of being able to get that from the most attractive man either because that man sees that woman as a
exceedingly expensive because of the opportunity cost it would require to devote himself exclusively to her and raising a family with her or that she's not sufficiently attractive for him to do that like that's the truth of the situation and so a lot of women understand that okay if I really want this maybe I need to go after a different type of man a man who is more caring who's able to provide who has a stable job maybe he's not the most interesting guy but
maybe he's not the most attractive guy but if I play my cards right I might be able to get a ring I might be able to get a house I might be able to get some kids
I think what I'm referring to is more like one of the most interesting things I've heard I've done like over 8,000 interviews and this to me was the most mind-blowing thing I'd ever heard
um Phil Messing who was a New York Post reporter he did a talk with uh Pete Panuccio who was a homicide detective in New York and they did a talk about some of the big homicide cases in New York
and Phil was talking about going to uh to interview a death row inmate and there's certain hours where they're allowed visitors
and he said it was the most fascinating thing to go during those visiting hours
and here he the way he described it was a lineup of tens of women no kidding they're here for their death row
daddy wow it's like what the fuck you should make a documentary about that no but that's kind of what
I'm talking about these women could probably get anybody they want but they're looking for this guy
who's locked up never getting out jobless moneyless just crazy that kind of behavior
or and serial killers even that have targeted women yeah multiple times or women that like look for
inmates you know they get become pen pals and I've done a couple of those well yeah I remember
seeing a couple episodes from a I think there was one woman she was eastern european yeah who um got
involved with someone on the death row Ivana I think so and what was interesting as I recall about
her story is I think she was raised in um wartime I believe you're right I think she was raised in
Bosnia during in the 90s during some of the the conflicts in the dissolution of Yugoslavia that's right
and you can have all kinds of ethics and and moral principles however in in wartime a lot of those
things go out the window like the ability to attach yourself to a man with a known willingness and
track record in killing might be the safest fucking thing that you could possibly do like it's wise to
do that I learned this in my own family like my grandfather was a soldier who in the aftermath of
World War II walked with my grandmother and a few other civilians from Ukraine to Germany before
kind of like getting everybody on boats to America like I doubt that my grandmother and those civilians
would have gone with him if he wasn't a killer and he that he didn't have a gun and knew how to use it
like they were safer with that man now according to stories I've been told it's he was not the easiest
person to live with let's put it that way and it's like Ivana you can take the girl out of war but
sometimes you can't take the war out of the girl and what might be very adaptive and even rational in some
contexts might be really maladaptive and irrational in others this is a very obvious example but I think
to a lesser extent this kind of programming affects all of us to one degree or another where the things
that this is an interesting idea is like a lot of the the the neuroses that's an outdated term a lot of like
the the mental issues that people deal with at one point in their lives were their most adaptive solution
to a problem they were facing usually in their families of origin it may not make sense outside of
the family though and it might be less effective more expensive even come with painful consequences but if
people haven't like updated their browser if they haven't really like taken in the fact that they're
no longer children living in that household under these circumstances they can have those things
affect them for often the rest of their lives even but like I say most the word dysfunction is the word
function dysfunction mostly works if it didn't no one would fucking do it so that's something to keep in
mind when you're potentially judging other people and or judging yourself is that there's probably a
reason why you do the things that you do even if they cause you pain yeah humans are interesting
they're fascinating man and we're all psychologists to some degree or another you kind of have to be
you do because people are both a potential solution to a problem and the biggest fucking problem you're
ever going to have like when your partner is giving you a hard time over something
and you just see it as like it's not really warranted you you have to get inside her head
figure out what what's going on there so that you can understand where she's coming from it so you need
to become a therapist that's true but that goes back to the trap of understanding which we were
talking about earlier like you can do that or you can say I the regardless of where this is coming
from it's like your leg is broken heal that and then play with me you'll never have a partner ever
well because I don't know about that we're all broken to some extent to some extent but like
we said some farts smell better than others and some people actually have healed a little bit more
than others you keep coming back to the farts it all comes back to the farts
two of my favorite talks you've done they're like bookends why beautiful women are nuts and why
successful men are jerks oh yeah provocative titles it's a while since I wrote those you might have
to jog my memory oh yes I remember now mm-hmm which one do you want me to talk to talk about
first take your pick which one you're in the mood for well you got to compare the two let's go with
why successful men are jerks because I've found that when we give men a hard time first sometimes
it's more palatable yeah when we come to the women you're you're learning how to be thank you
so uh the word I would use which I used in the episode but not in the title is why successful
men are assholes and that's generally what men are accused of as being assholes and I think the issue
the reason why successful men turn out this way I don't think they usually start this way they turn
into that is because they have learned to do all kinds of things that they don't really want to do
in order to get and keep women I don't think women understand that look probably 90 95 percent of
what an average man does is designed to increase his chances to either get or keep women I would
say higher than that you think higher than 95 percent I mean like I remember having this conversation
when I was younger and we're all dating and one of my friends goes everything a man does whether he's
become successful powerful rich whatever you name it it's all just to get women well I said that in
the episode why successful men cheat it's like a lot of people shake their heads in disbelief why would
this guy who's at the top of his craft his industry he's president he's king like he has everything and he
threw it all away by sleeping with some woman some intern some mistress and it's like you're missing the
point the reason why he became the CEO and the president was to be able to do that like that's
that's the brass ring that's unconsciously held out for men that's why they work sometimes to their
graves and they die in harness that's so frustrating for women though and in what sense like a woman
thinks like I'm the perfect partner for this guy he should be happy with me forever and she's done
nothing wrong and then one day he just finds a 24 year old and yeah well we can I can talk about I
can talk to that like it's it's very difficult to have stable fulfilling long-term relationships
not least of all because no one continues to pay the plumber what does that mean so it's like
when your toilet is so many great talks when your toilet is clogged the pump the plumber is in very
high demand but after the clog has been resolved no one continues to pay the plumber you get him out
of the house you give him what he's owed but that's it we're done here so it's like people go to other
people because they need and want things from others the issue is that in giving those things to
another I'm complicit in my own obsolescence like a plumber who doesn't unclog clogs isn't a plumber
like he would get no business whatsoever but as soon as he's done unclogging the clog he's got no more
business now the world is full of clogs there's always going to be plumbers right but the issue is
if I need to give you what you want to get into a relationship with you but giving you what you want
means you no longer need to be in a relationship with me how the fuck do we do this right and so
in the long term this is not something that we openly discuss at all I've never heard anyone talk
about this we have to continue to find new problems to solve in the our partner's lives we need new ways
to be needed and if those new ways do not produce themselves then either you generally you just drift
apart and maybe you separate but maybe you just become like roommates and platonic friends living
in your own house which maybe isn't the worst thing but probably isn't the best thing either
right this is often why in particular marriages suffer a crisis when the kids are launched or about
to be launched you both parties might have chosen each other to some extent because you think that this
person would be a good mother very kind good with children or this would be a loyal family man it's
like okay now if you have kids you'll never not be a parent but like those qualities and behaviors and
attributes are much less relevant now that the kids are 20 than they were when they were two so if
you don't have anything else to give you're like the plumber who's unclogged the drain and that found seems really
shitty because it's like af because raising children is no small thing and a partnership of 20 years
shouldn't be just thrown out like yesterday's garbage right but the issue is in there could be
another 40 years of life left like that's a long time to not have a need to be discharged to not have
something that we're working on together and so that's what i counsel folks are going through this
is you have to find other projects that really speak to the both of you that you can collaborate on
and there's there's tons that that could be you could adopt a bunch of dogs and foster them you
could travel the world and start becoming influencers together you can found a new business you can build
a house together like you have to do some kind of overarching project you need to keep dangling the
carrot there needs to be a new clog yeah there needs to be a new clog that needs to be unclogged
and in the absence of that you don't you get rid of the plumber that's why people who need nothing
from their partners their relationships are the most precarious i was once doing a consultation with
an older woman who was having marital difficulties and she was just like i i don't know what the problem
is like i have my own money from my family like i don't i'd be fine by myself i don't need my husband
for anything and i was like if that's true which probably isn't but if that's true you should never
tell him that don't ever say that with your mouth and certainly don't communicate that with your
attitude or your behavior because i'm sure he doesn't think that he does nothing for you
and if you act as if he does nothing for you in spite of his efforts and his loyalty and his
continued investment he's going to feel like the biggest schmuck in the world because he's clearly
still giving and trying and it's not even being acknowledged or recognized and that's a dangerous
game to be to have one's efforts not even recognized or invalidated we need to need each other
and in the absence of that we just have desire we just have want which is a very capricious thing
it comes and goes if it's just desire why not break up when the desire ends that sounds reasonable the
whole basis the relationship was desire there's no more desire we came here to eat dinner we had our
food time to go home makes sense so i'm sorry i can pull it back around so i was about to say so a lot
of guys do that they don't want to do in order to be competitive with women to get access to them
and what they begin to learn as they make decent choices and become more successful
is that women tend to respond to them more and better as a function of having things that they can
offer women that women really want like a 20 year old man could give a woman his heart
but a 45 year old man could give her a yacht could give her a family could give her travel around the
world could give her the ability to quit her job could give her the ability to become a mother
in a way that the 21 year old might not be able to because he's just not emotionally mature enough he
doesn't have the lifestyle he doesn't have the wealth be extremely difficult for him to do that
and so what six what happens as men become more successful and women start to respond to them
differently without them really changing much about themselves they start to realize what really moves
the needle with women and it's not romance it's not loving her more than the other men in her life
it's being able and willing to give her more than the other men in her life and so men begin to dispense
because successful men are often very rational and very effective they start to dispense with the
behaviors that don't instrumentally move the needle with women and so they stop the romance they stop
the courtship and they maybe even become a little corrupted in the sense of they feel entitled that
i have these things this is what you respond to so we can move forward in that way in the same way that
women can become corrupted sometimes when they realize how much men respond to their physical beauty
and some women believe that because of the way that they look that they're entitled to certain things
it's kind of the same thing in just different gendered expressions and of course it goes along
those lines because men are fundamentally trying to exchange resources for sexual opportunity and women
are attempting to exchange extra opportunity for resources it's not the other way around
so that's why we see that successful men become assholes which is a woman's term for a man not really
caring about the emotional dimension of the relationship and he learns that as a successful man because when he
was attending to that but he was unsuccessful it didn't work and as he became more successful and
he didn't attend to it he had more success and effectiveness with women so women taught him
what to value with respect to his dealings with them does that make sense makes perfect sense do you
what do you say to people who say your your views are so unromantic well they are they are unromantic like
i i understand what romance is it's not necessarily a bad thing but romance doesn't make
people happy and it certainly doesn't i mean life is not a romantic comedy that's not the sweet lovable
guy doesn't always end up with the girl at the end of the movie right i mean even think about the way
that that's those narratives are played out it's never the successful romantic ceo versus the poor practical
small town guy because that guy would never win he doesn't have either thing so the the reason why romance
kind of exists is it gives the small town poor unsuccessful guy some chance of potentially leveling
the playing field against the successful accomplished man who actually can provide value to women and make
their lives better than they might otherwise be so romance is generally for unsuccessful men it's a way for
them to potentially offer something that the successful men either can't but most likely won't because
they feel like they don't need to because they've been taught that they don't buy women fascinating yeah
yeah i mean if you want to get to the truth of why things are the way they are we we can't really be
romantic imagine if like romanticism used to be a it was initially like a genre of it was a literary
movement and can you imagine if our if our scientists of the 19th century were romantics and weren't willing
to like cut open corpses and run experiments and separate the atom it's like it would be very difficult
to understand the truth about the natural world now is this the be all end all this kind of empirical
scientific understanding no no it has its limitations as well
but romanticism is sort of like a fuzziness it's sort of like a mood
and moods are
moods are subjective they're subject to change and they don't often reveal actionable
knowledge that we can use to make better decisions moving forward
that's what i got to that what about the women that are nuts attractive women are nuts oh yeah
beautiful women are nuts
so many of them are um this one's actually pretty simple the reason why beautiful women are nuts is
that no one tells them the truth no one tells them the truth especially if they're precociously beautiful
like i don't know have you have any of the women of the 8 000 interviews that you've done talked about
this have they talked about going through puberty puberty when they were still adolescents and and like
dealing with the new kind of attention that they were getting from men yeah it comes up once in a while
it's like we don't want to talk about it because it's like anything that happens before you're 18 is
like oh we don't but you see that behavior well you see that absolutely and and women young women
don't know how to handle it when why would they or should they right but it's like suddenly because
their body has changed the boys in their classroom are treating them differently and looking at them
differently and not just the boys in their classroom but the boys fathers and the boys grandfathers it's
like men apparently never really stopped desiring young attractive women so these women now have to
deal with a great deal of interest and attention from which is a kind of power and it's a power that
they've done nothing to earn they just sort of like lived a little bit longer and their body did what
the body did right so this is can be very dangerous because i mean think about it why did i why did i go
through the trouble of like becoming a psychologist or why did i before that get really good at test prep
and teach people about the gre and learn how to do that before that how did i why did i become an actor
and it's like because people weren't just giving me money people weren't just giving me sex people
weren't just giving me entertainment and flights and dinners like and those things sound nice don't
they right they're not necessary but they sure make life a little bit more pleasant so i had to earn them
which is what most guys have to do and we have to earn them generally indirectly by becoming very good
at something which takes a long time and to compete successfully with other men often in the arena of
life and then maybe with some other things factored in we can potentially get some of those good things
but we pay for them now if i hit if i ever since i was 16 people were offering to buy me food or to
pay for my tuition or to take me out every night of the week or to give me relationships and love
would i have worked as hard as i have in my life fuck no absolutely like i know that enough about
myself it's like that's just too seductive it's like the one ring of power man it's like very few people
could actually resist that because the reason why we struggle is generally to get those things not
because we are so virtuous that we believe that struggle is inherently valuable like some of us
eventually get there but we are vanishingly few and we generally get there through um pathway that i'm
describing now um so a lot of attractive women they realize that the source of their um i mean
and this has been happening as long as you've been kind of like a conscious adult
why wouldn't you become entitled why wouldn't you expect it if it's happened 10 000 times in the past over
the last 10 years it's like i expect the sun is going to rise in the morning even though there's no
fucking guarantee that it will it's like it's just happened billions of times i think it's the safe bet
you see so that can create problems first of all like i don't even know if a totalitarian monarch
doesn't get told no from time to time maybe the ministers have to be kind of gentle about how they
oppose him or reject him but like there are few people that have lived in the history of the world
that get more of what they want less than what they don't than a beautiful woman and
it's hard to be told no it's hard to be rejected it sucks to not get what you want it does now most of
us though we we learn to deal with that because we kind of accept that that's just the way the world
works like mick said you can't always get what you want most of us can't often get what we want right
so if but it does take time to learn how to tolerate rejection to deal with the sting of disappointment and
lack it toughens you up it might make you a better person potentially can anyway but it takes a while
and it takes a while whether that starts when you're two or whether that starts when you're 30.
the issue is when it like anybody who is told no for the first time they generally have a meltdown and
a tantrum and tantrums don't really look good on anybody but they look much better than a toddler
than an adult okay so one thing that can be very difficult is you're dealing with with a beautiful
woman you're dealing with like a toddler emotionally at least in the respect of this person has never
truly not been able to get what she wanted and the likelihood that some kind of outburst is going to
occur is quite high and we often see that kind of dysregulation behaviorally as kind of nuttiness right
so that's one way but let's talk about how no one tells these women the truth because men very early
on it doesn't take long for them to figure this out but they realize the truth does not get them laid
the truth does not get them laid like almost every guy does this at some point in his life
especially because he thinks it's going to differentiate himself from all the other guys
out there i'm not like the other guys you know i'm gonna i'm just gonna tell you how it is
if women can do this experiment it'd be very easy they can do it for free they can make like a fake
profile on a dating app with some pictures of a guy even like attractive men and just change what
they're looking for to casual relationships and see how many matches they get and what kind of
responses they get versus if they say that they're looking for a long-term relationship
i think that probably 90 percent more than 90 percent of men on dating apps are looking for
long-term relationships which is fascinating do i think that 90 percent of the male population at any
one time is looking for a long-term relationship no but they learn that if they say that they're just
looking to have casual consensual relationship with another woman who's attracted to them they
don't get any responses and women train them that way like if the truth got men laid the world would
look so much better than it currently does like can you imagine like women actually do have the power
to remake the world indirectly by choosing which men to reward with sex and relationships and under what
circumstances and let me tell you if if a woman one got better at sussing out the truth from lies
which they're not very good at because most people aren't very good at that um and just did not have
sex with men who lied to them man we'd have a much more honest population like very quickly but one
women have a hard time differentiating the truth from lies um and two they often care about other things
more they do it's like
like where would women hang out if they truly valued honesty above all things like
i don't know charities yeah where do honest men hang out there's not that many
where do they congregate where do they congregate right question
maybe like philosophical clubs or churches i mean there's plenty of dishonest people in both of those but
like probably better than dive bars or night clubs right yeah i blame the dads well that's what i talk
about in the end of that episode is that the there are exceptions not all beautiful women are nuts but
those women tend to have very strong male figures in their life fathers and brothers who were able to
tell the woman the truth and bear her hatred bear her insults and her criticism and her emotional
outbursts because it was the kind of like the right thing to do not just from the perspective of some
vague virtue but for her it's the best thing to do because now she can become like
a full emotional adult those are rare it's rare for men and women it's true it's like
chronological age has absolutely nothing to do with emotional or psychological age and most of the people
who are walking around despite what their driver's license says are probably between eight and 12
years old but if you accept that that might be true the rest of society starts to make a lot of sense
you certainly can't begin with the assumption that people are just virtuous and mature why would the
world look the way that it does if you go the other way around a lot of things make sense
you think so i do i do uh it did seem like there was a lot of barbarism back in the day man i guess
you're right it's not like that stuff doesn't happen at all in today's day and age but i do think it's on
the decline i think that fewer people live in poverty today than they have at any point in human history
there's more literate people i think the quality of life for the average person has increased
significantly i think there's less violence overall clearly we have things to work on but i think there
are also reasons to be hopeful but you have to understand that these things they take a long time
to change the degree of understanding in humanity is still very low still very low if you go too high
you lose people or they get scared and then they they attack you so you kind of have to like
just be a little bit further along and increase a person's understanding by like another degree another
step and there could be a lot of steps to get to where we ultimately want to go together so there's
no hurry it's not going to happen while you and i are alive
one of your other talks that i thought was great was how to pass through suffering
oh yeah that was a useful one i think
because life is suffering a lot of it is it doesn't have to be
i just wrote a script today so this is kind of top of mind about suffering suffering is different from pain
in my opinion suffering is pain plus judgment and the judgment is generally that this pain is unbearable
or unendurable or unjust or unfair okay i think pain is everywhere around us except maybe for this one
very thin very narrow fluctuating path that kind of like is hedged on all sides by pain
we can call that the path of light and i think those are the two ways that all human beings can
learn you can either learn through pain or you can learn through light and 99 of people learn 99 of
their lessons through pain pain is a wonderful teacher because pain never lies it doesn't care about your
feelings it will tell you the honest brutal truth in a way that your loved ones won't your therapist
won't your priests won't pain always gives you direct honest feedback about how your behavior aligns
with reality we experience pain when our mental models cause us to act in spite of reality so to give
a very commonplace example if i believe that that uh that outlet over there should have no power in it
and so i would be free to stick a metal piece in there and suffer no consequences i would experience
pain as a consequence of that decision because my model was wrong i thought that there was no
power doing that or i didn't understand that metal conducts electricity or what have you but like
my ignorance motivated me to feel pain because i acted in a way that was like in spite of the way
things are that's a very i think obvious and physical example but we can see that even with
emotional and psychological pain as well is that at the root of it is that there's some sort of belief
that reality should be other than how it is and they're clinging to this idea and in some cases
continuing to make decisions in line with this incorrect model that bring them in constant
contact with pain but pain there's kind of like a guardianship to pain because it's on either side of
the path of light it's like the rumble strips on the edge of a road that let you know that you're
starting to drift off course like the more sensitive and responsive we become the less pain we really
need to feel to kind of wake up and course correct back on the path of light which is not a static
unchanging
route like it's very difficult to constantly unwaveringly follow that path it's very hard to
see which is why we get that feedback from the path of pain pain is good it's the it's the gift that
nobody wants and a life without pain would be very difficult to endure because we would be so far off
that path our lives and collectively humanity would devolve to such a degree that i don't think any of
us would want to be on this planet like pain ideally helps us get on that straight and narrow path where
we suffer less because what i've found is that the more pain there is the less light there is but the more
light there is the more pain there is and in some cases light is transmuted pain the great benefit
to light which we can say collectively is knowledge wisdom or revelation is that it can be communicated
to other people pain cannot be communicated to other people not really like if you've never broken your leg
how can i really tell you how that feels if you've never lost a child how can you really understand
what it what that grief feels like the only way you could possibly approximate it is if you've broken
your leg or you've lost a child and still wouldn't be exactly the same thing but at least we're kind of
in the ballpark right so pain is a very personal and subjective experience and it can't really be
communicated or transmitted which if that were the only option would suck because that means that
every person has to like start over and learn all the lessons from scratch and we wouldn't get anywhere
light can be transmitted light can be communicated which is fantastic and that's like the best resource
that we have collectively to fight back against the darkness and to reduce the amount of unnecessary
suffering on this planet and the light that i can transmit is my own transmuted pain it's me
potentially saying with my words i've learned this hard lesson from the teacher pain and i'm going
to try to teach it to you so that you don't have to learn the same lesson that i did now that said i do
think that everyone's has the right to make their own mistakes i do think that there might be something
let's say cowardly and meek about somebody who just takes good advice and on face value and never
runs the risk himself or herself i do think that we're allowed to make our own mistakes which is why
i never prevent people from doing something that i believe has a high likelihood of causing them pain
i'll i'll counsel them against it but i won't stop i won't stop them because just like myself they
might have to feel that pain they might have to feel it enough and they might have to feel it enough
times to finally learn their lesson and once they learn their lesson they course correct they change
their behavior so they're a little off the path of pain and a little bit more on the path of light
and they suffer less and the more light there is the more light there will be because people who
begin to suffer less have no interest in going back not really and they start to become it's like
a virtuous cycle they're like chasing after the light they follow the light and that's the best
way that i think we have as individuals and collectively to get out of the misery that
might otherwise be human existence so thank god for that uh yeah thank god for that for sure yeah
your talks just get more and more fascinating as they go on oh thanks your channel is incredible
i actually didn't uh answer your question about the suffering though so there's the episode you're
referring to okay it's called a horse in the rain yes so it's a it's a attempt to teach people what
to do when they are in the midst of suffering and this was a question that i was asked in one of my
courses back when i was a professor and the question was functionally dr terabin you've talked so much
about unnecessary suffering and how to undo it but what about calling some suffering unnecessary
assumes that some suffering is necessary which i kind of believe is true certainly from like a buddhist
perspective we can't escape old age sickness and death let's put it that way unless we die young i
guess um so there's somewhat necessary suffering that human beings are subject to passing through
how do you deal with that and what came to me was this image of a horse in the rain you ever
seen a horse in the rain mark just stand there that's right it's just standing there getting wet
it's not trying to dance around the raindrops and some sort of manic futile desire to not get drenched
it's not like beating its hooves and lamenting the injustice that it's raining here and not over there on
those horses it's not enviously plotting against the horses in the stable it's not like laying down
and just surrendering oh my god this is so miserable i'll never be dry again like those are all human
forms of suffering animals don't experience that which is part of why i think we envy animals in some
in some respect so a lot of the it might be necessary to be wet it might be necessary to be in the rain but
all these other judgments and stories that we're subject to telling ourselves about our circumstances
are totally unnecessary and make the suffering so much more painful than it otherwise needs to be
it's really not that painful to be wet and to be cold for a while it's okay those those are conditions
that will change and then you might end up being so dry and hot that you'll miss being cold and wet at
some point you know that's kind of the human condition so the issue is to not make your situation
worse than it already is a compliment to this is the advice i've given about what if you find yourself
in the jaws of life that's what i call it sometimes people just end up sometimes to their own fault
sometimes not but they find themselves in a really dangerous and precarious situation the jaws of life
it's like you're the bunny and life is the wolf and it's got you in its mouth right i don't know if
you've ever seen that in a nature documentary but what the bunny does under those circumstances
is not fight against what's happening it doesn't resist what is happening why because the teeth are right
there if the bunny was to start to struggle those teeth would just dig deeper and deeper into its
flesh and it would be next to impossible at that point to escape so what the bunny does it goes limp
it almost plays dead it doesn't expend unnecessary energy struggling against something that it can't
escape from and it potentially waits for its moment
which often happens where in some
momentary lapse of concentration or attention or a feeling like the dinner is a sure thing
the wolf relaxes his mouth a little bit and the bunny fucking dashes out as fast as it can
so that's the goal it's like when you're really dealing with something difficult don't make it worse
than it already is and wait for your moment if you're lucky you might get one and then you take it
as best you can
on that note we'll uh we'll wind it up already wow this was so fast it was an hour already it was an
hour good lord well this has been great mark thanks for having me all your talks are fantastic i think
your your mind is just so fascinating oh thank you sir all right till next time bye-bye thanks
