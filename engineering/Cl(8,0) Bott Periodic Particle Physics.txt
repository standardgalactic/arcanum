let me shut up and introduce um hand over to to jinder who is going to introduce our speaker today
uh nicole furry um if i could just say uh that of course the almost the the principal reason
we're here and that this entire seminar series is taking place is because it has been inspired
to a great extent by the program which uh with which uh nicole is uh is herself and so now
closely identified um so i'm going to hand over to to jinder who will have quite a bit more to say
thank you michael i couldn't agree with you more about what you said just now about cole
so it's my pleasure to welcome cole fury to give today's lecture on octaneums and particle physics
cole obtained a phd from perimeter in 2015 and a thesis titled standard model physics from an algebra
is one of the best known phd thesis in high energy theoretical physics in recent times this thesis
left a mark on studies of octaneums in particle physics to the extent that her name has almost
become synonymous with the subject a 14-part set of video lectures on division algebras and the standard
model is the must see for anyone interested in getting into the subject for me her most significant
work is charged quantization from a number operator where the properties of one generation of standard
model fermions are convincingly derived from a clipper algebra motivated from the complex octaneums
i also have an interesting personal story to tell i first heard of octaneums only three years back
when my own work indicated that eight dimensional spaces would be significant for unification however
i had never heard of such a space so i googled the term eight dimensional spaces google returned a
quantum magazine article on coal and her work on the octaneums and within minutes of reading it
i knew this to be what i was looking for that same evening i wrote to her and she was kind enough to
immediately send back an encouraging reply since then it has been octaneums all the way and none of
it would have been possible without the groundwork done by her so thank you cole and over to you for
this exciting lecture thank you so much to ginger that was um yeah extremely kind um okay thank you
okay um so first of all i want to uh say thank you sincerely to both to ginger and to michael for
organizing this lecture series um you know these things of course take a lot of work and i hope that
you know that many of us are really grateful to you for putting it together um the atmosphere uh so
far has been really positive and many of us really appreciate that um and before i start um i would like
to mention that many of the results i'm going to be discussing today were done in collaboration with
two people namely beth romano who is a number theorist at king's college london and for earlier
work mia hughes who completed her phd on super gravity at imperial college london now in this talk i'm
going to be discussing some work on three generations um especially later on in the talk and we're of course not
the only ones to be working on this problem um there's of course uh corinne minogue tevin dre and
robert wilson who have um an e8 three generation model there's david chester mike rios and collaborators
who've been working on a three generation on who've been working on three generation e8 models niels
gresnik and adam gillard who've worked on three generations and complex seal eight to ginger singh and
his group who have worked on e8 and exception and the exceptional jordan algebra ivan todorov michelle dubois
violette who worked on the exceptional jordan algebra latham boyle who's worked on exceptional
jordan algebra david jackson who i believe has also done uh worked with three generations and uh
the exceptional jordan algebra um and uh now that i've got this list down i think um also greg trailing
i should have also included um and i'm certainly um forgetting people on this list unintentionally
um but the the point is that there's uh quite a number of us now that are uh working on this uh
this challenge okay so with this said as theorists every once in a while it's good to take a step back
and ask what is my best guess to the following question that is what is the universe made of
and how does it work what is my best guess that is imagine that tomorrow that our game of building
theories would for some reason be over or imagine that our profession were soon to be overtaken by some
accelerating self-improving artificial intelligence if you were asked to lay your cards on the table
what would be your best what would your best guess be well this is of course a difficult question to
answer since um you know we're always working with incomplete information nonetheless in this talk i
would like to offer for you what is my current best guess and i'm going to run you through the logic
right from the very beginning so every research project starts out with some sort of intuition or some
picture of what nature is at its essence for example in quantum field theory we have a picture
of particles on a space-time where the particles are described by excitations on a on a of a field
living on a manifold physical theories of course begin with some initial input or some initial
structures that are meant to make up reality of course these structures should be chosen very carefully
seeing as how one wrong assumption may lead your theory to shipwreck that is every extra structure
carries with it a risk of being wrong now our current best model of particle physics is known as the
standard model on one hand the standard model works better than any previous particle model that we've
had in making predictions in particle physics on the other hand it leaves many basic questions answered
for example why is it rooted in the gauge group su3 cross su2 cross u1 over z6 and not some other
group why do we have the space-time symmetries that we do and even if we were to understand where these
symmetries came from we would still be unable to explain why this standard model has this long and
apparently senseless list of fundamental particles furthermore it doesn't answer what makes up dark
matter dark energy believed to comprise 95 of the mass energy content of the universe and this isn't even
an exhaustive list of open questions so one might wonder if perhaps we haven't been making some
assumptions or there there have been some assumptions made in our construction of the standard model
that could be preventing it from accessing a more complete description of nature
now as you know the standard model has quite a lengthy list of initial inputs
we begin with the three plus one dimensional space-time manifold a manifold in and of itself has
non-trivial structure we then add in a fox space matter fields gauge fields higgs fields we impose the
quantization procedure etc now given that every extra structure brings with it a risk of being wrong
we might instead opt to minimize our initial inputs that is we will seek to minimize our initial inputs
for practical reasons because this is the most cautious way to proceed
now another reason that we might consider aiming for a minimalistic theory is for reasons of beauty
so it's my personal opinion that mathematical elegance is a valid guide in model building
but the question is then well who gets to decide what elegance is
my personal take is that a more beautiful theory is one that compresses the physical data
more efficiently so in the case of the standard model we have described aspects of a very complex
natural world by using a very complex theory what would be more beautiful in my mind is a minimalistic
set of initial inputs that could still output the same predictions
so we could take the game of go as an analogy
go has a set of rules that are simple enough to teach a child
but the resulting scenarios are complex enough that adults can spend their lives studying them
now building a successful minimalistic model presents for us a bigger challenge for a couple of reasons
the first reason is that your theory now has a lot more work to do
in terms of creating something complex out of something simple
it's also more challenging for sociological reasons
that is nobody's colleagues are impressed by simple machines
so at the end of my undergrad and throughout my masters i began playing a bit of a game
here's the game the game is to answer what could be the smallest set of initial inputs to start with
the game is to start with whereby you still capture as many known features of nature as possible
for example you might want to capture the irreversibility of time
or the existence of matter in its interactions
or the existence or emergence of space-time the three plus one dimensionality of space-time
quality or entropy increase etc
so a big dream would be to would be something along the lines of starting with some minimal inputs
and arriving at say standard model scattering amplitudes
as a side note i want to point out that we physicists often make the mistake that mathematicians
know not to make that is once we have one established theory that can make predictions
like the standard model in the form of qft we often assume that it is unique that it's the only story
that it's going to produce for us the answers that we need or in other words we conflate existence with
uniqueness the standard model is a machine that amongst other things spits out probabilities
a probability is just a real number between zero and one
one there could conceivably exist a much simpler model that could spit out the same probabilities
now as a first attempt at this problem i wanted to aim for something that does away with the
hierarchical system that we assume in qft that is where we have various fields living on top of the
space-time manifold so one picture that i proposed along these lines is based solely on directed graphs
so clearly this resembles feyman graphs except for the fact that it is not embedded in a separate
background space time instead these directed graphs would be the only objects in the model
so everything that we perceive as matter its interactions the apparent space time in which
it would live would ultimately have to come from only these directed graphs
this was an idea that i proposed in my part three research essay in 2006
later i included it in the first chapter of my phd thesis at the time i received a significant
amount of pushback for this idea there was a very small number of us at the time that quite
literally risked our careers in order to put these ideas forward
one example i'm aware of comes from fotini marcopolo and david cribs who suggested that the world should
be constructed using quantum information processing systems again with no notion of a separate underlying
space time in more recent times these sorts of ideas have gained mainstream mainstream acceptance
with similar standalone graph models being proposed by established professors
so this was the first round of this minimalistic model building game however you can see that we
already run into a problem which incidentally the standard model also faces
that is as with the standard model there's no obvious explanation as to why space time appears to be
three plus one dimensional so how might we face up to this problem
so this is where we might very cautiously add in more structure namely we're going to add in the
structure of an algebra and the idea is that if these directed graphs were in fact representing the
operations of an algebra then maybe we could use the properties of this algebra in order to give
the dimension of what we eventually see as an emergent space time
okay well then which algebra do you choose
as a first example you could consider the algebra of the quaternions which has this because
it's got this suggestive structure it's got one real dimension and three imaginary dimensions
now as i mentioned early on in my part three essay the basic notion would then be of graphs of
quaternionic triads like quaternionic field binds branching out over and over and over again
and sometimes also doing the reverse process where where they join edges together at a vertex
now this branching is supposed to give general phenomena such as things like entropy increase
and the universe's expansion and joining of edges at a vertex on the other hand is meant to ultimately
give us phenomena such as gravity interactions in what we eventually might come to know as measurement
and i notice that these quaternionic triads bear a striking resemblance to the field
binds of general relativity and we're going to get back to this later
now any physicist who has worked with the quaternions know that they almost give you
the physics that you want but not quite that is the inner automorphisms of the of the quaternions
give us so3 not the lorenz group but it turns out that if you tweak this slightly then several doors open up
that is in physics we've got these familiar two by two hermitian matrices known as the pauli matrices
and there's this well-known correspondence between sigma x and i sigma epsilon one sigma y and i epsilon
two sigma z and i epsilon three where i is the complex imaginary unit and epsilon one two three are
quaternionic imaginary units now furthermore it's a well-known fact that there is an isomorphism between
the two by two complex matrices and the quaternions now with complex coefficients
so not only can we get these quickly relevant pauli matrices from the complex quaternions but we can
furthermore get the lorenz group that is the group of inner automorphisms of the complex quaternions is
given by none other than so31
now it turns out that there's this old paper from the 1930s by aw conway which shows that you can
describe dirac spinners four vectors the field strength tensor using nothing more than the complex
quaternions
as you may recognize this already this is already most of the lorenz representations that
we use today in the standard model okay so this is hopeful um and what i want to show you now
number one is that there is in fact a bigger picture
behind conway's findings having to do with discrete symmetries
this bigger picture will allow us to get a complete set of the standard models representations
this involves the inclusion of scalars and selection of majorana's spinner representations over dirac
and finally um there uh this bigger picture will allow us it will lead us to an idea
that might help us address the following question that is if all we have is this algebra these algebraic
graphs then how are things like field strength tensors and spinners supposed to pop out or emerge
so let's talk about this last point first
so if all we have is in algebra then how are things like field strength tensors and spinners
supposed to pop out
now a bigger picture behind conway's findings that i was referring to refers to the idea of an ideal
so let's say we have some algebra in this case given by the complex quaternions
a left ideal is a special subalgebra whereby if you were to left multiply any element a in the algebra
onto an element v in the ideal then their product v prime will always get pulled back inside the ideal
so loosely speaking you can think of ideals as an algebra's version of a black hole
and that it will pull any element into itself via multiplication
and so these ideals um you can think of them as the stable subspaces of the algebra
so now what we're going to find shortly is that each of the lorentz representations of the standard model
can be identified as objects that generalize the notion of an ideal so in this sense the scalars the
spinners the four vectors a field string tensor can be seen to be stable subspaces of the algebra
for mathematicians these are known as invariant subspaces under some action of the algebra on itself
so the idea i propose in my thesis is very much in in the flavor of darwin's mechanism of survival of
the fittest the fact that ideals are stable under multiplication could be viewed as them surviving
over time now you notice that this example that in this example we assumed that the multiplication rule
is left multiplication but we could just as well have assumed right multiplication or perhaps
something more general such as an adjoin action so what i'm about to show you is that the scalar
spinners four vectors and field string tensor the various lorentz representations of the standard
model can each be thought of as generalizations of ideals under different multiplication rules
a more precise way to say this is that each of the lorentz representations of the standard
model can be shown to be invariant subspaces of the complex quaternions under some action of
the algebra on itself so this next part is important
okay um the next part important because we're going to use some of the details in the
in the later parts of the talk okay so the complex quaternions have these three discrete symmetries
we've got the complex conjugate which maps complex i to minus i we've got the quaternionic conjugate
which takes quaternionic epsilon 1 2 and 3 to minus epsilon 1 2 and 3 and it also reverses the order
of multiplication and finally we've got what we call the hermitian conjugate which does both the
complex conjugate and the quaternionic conjugate at the same time now under each of these discrete
symmetries the complex quaternions split into two pieces for example starting on the left-hand side
we get one piece which is invariant under the complex conjugate and the other piece picks up a negative
sign under the complex conjugate and the same goes for the hermit for the hermitian conjugate one piece
is going to be hermitian and the other one's going to be anti-hermitian and the same is true for the
quaternionic conjugate there's one piece that picks up a plus sign and the other one picks up a minus sign
now based on these discrete symmetries we can now define actions of the algebra on itself or in
other words generalized multiplication rules so these actions are chosen so that for example an object
that starts out hermission will continue to be permission no matter which a in the algebra that you apply to it
it and the same goes for the anti-hermitian piece so any a that you apply onto it if it starts out
anti-hermitian it will end up anti-hermitian again um so this is the multiplication rule um or more
precisely the action um that we use for the hermitian conjugate um and then uh there's also a similar
action for the quaternionic conjugate that looks like this you'll notice that the two uh the they look
similar to each other it's because um the um hermission conjugate and the quaternionic conjugate
are both anti-automorphisms um now for the complex conjugate on the other hand here's what the
here's what the action looks like um the p here is nothing more than a chirality projector
so under each of these actions every one of these subspaces listed here is stable
um now finally we need to identify what these stable subspaces are going to represent for us
you can probably already guess now suppose we take some element a um to be an element of the group sl2c
written of course in the language of complex quaternions then based on the specific way that
these subspaces transport these two subspaces on the left hand side can each be identified as a
majorana spinner the two subspaces in the center can each be identified as four vectors and the two
subspaces on the right hand side can be identified as a complex scalar and a six real dimensional field
string tensor so finally there is uh another feature that is going to come up again later and that's that
in the case of these two anti-automorphisms c cross h gets broken down into a jordan algebra and a lee
algebra so here the hermitian subspace gives a jordan algebra and the anti-hermitian subspace gives a lee
algebra and the same goes for the quaternionic conjugate um here the scalar um gives a jordan
algebra and the field string tensor gives a lee algebra
okay so let's take stock now where we've come so far with this model so we started out uh with
the minimalistic input that nature is made of nothing more than directed graphs then we notice
that a generic directed graph is not going to lead to the emergence of a three plus one dimensional
space time so from here we propose considering that these directed graphs represent the operations of
an algebra now which algebra should we choose we found that the algebra of the complex quaternions
can give us quite a bit of mileage that is we found that the discrete symmetries of the complex
quaternions provide us with an exquisitely compressed uh way to describe scalar spinners four vectors in
the field string tensor and this gives us the complete set of lorentz representations that we use in the
standard model now i want to emphasize that the the system of lorentz representations is in many ways the
poster child for what a minimalistic model should look like now what we're going to do for the rest of
this talk is demonstrate a way to take this system and to scale it up okay so how are we going to do this
well the particles of the standard model have more properties uh beyond just their behavior under
lorentz transformations they of course have color weak isospin weak hypercharge for example
so is there a way that we could also model these extra degrees of freedom
well let's take a closer look at this algebra that we're using the complex quaternions are given by
c cross h where the tensor product is over r and it's straightforward to see that this c cross h is
trivially equal to r cross c cross h where the r is the real numbers and at this point you might also
notice that this algebra is the tensor product of three out of four of the finite dimensional norm
division algebras over r so it's then natural to wonder well you know what if we were to include
the final norm division algebra the octoneons could the combined algebra rcho then allow us to include
the remaining internal degrees of freedom well this question becomes even more unavoidable when you
notice that the number of internal states in one generation adds up to eight that is a neutrino red
green and blue down type quarks red green and blue up type quarks and a charged lepton
now there are examples of earlier researchers who have noticed similar patterns
namely in the 1970s gunaitin and gursey identified quark anti a quark anti-quark pair under su3 within the
octoneons and as for the full rcho algebra back in the 1990s jeffrey dixon proposed a series of
particle models based on the algebra of two by two matrices over rcho rcho makes up the components of
this algebra so it's why we often refer to rcho as the dixon algebra jeffrey is the first person i know
to have had an algebra named after him now i should point out that murat gunaitin as a student jeffrey
dixon and a number of us attending this conference have had to weather a lot of pushback for coming
forward with these ideas on the octoneons well this for me is a really curious state of affairs
the octoneons are just a mathematical object just like any other object just like any other mathematical
object so having a prejudiced against having a prejudice against the octoneons makes about as
much sense to me as having a prejudice against number seven
a recurring theme in my talk will be recurring themes so since we're here why don't we linger on
this point a little on a somewhat related note i want to mention that over recent years there have
been more established physicists working on the octoneons than there were before
so to these mathematical physicists i would like to say welcome it's nice to have you here
secondly to these established professors i would also like to remind you that that there have been
many researchers working on octoneons long before you got here many of those researchers who are here
tonight or who might be listening to this later risked their careers in order to work on this topic
some of them have even been unable to continue in academia because of that choice
so with this said i would like to encourage you to be as inclusive as possible with
these researchers when you write your papers and you tell your story this goes especially in the case
where you've made use of the work of these earlier researchers
because many of these physicists have taken a risk and have paid a price that you have not
okay so we're now at the point uh where we have now upgraded our algebra uh to rcho a 32 complex
dimensional algebra and we would like to eventually calculate standard model scattering amplitudes
so our first step then is to try to model the full particle content of the standard model much in
the way that we modeled lorence scalers spinners four vectors in the field string tensor using the
complex quaternions okay so what's the standard model's particle content
well as you know the standard model's gauge group is su3 cross su2 cross u1 over z6
and under this group the standard model has this very long and seemingly arbitrary list of
irreducible representations the first entry in here in the brackets refers to the ear rep under su3 color
the second refers to the ear rep under su2 left and the third refers to weak hypercharge
and the subscript at the end refers to the multiplicity of these off-shell states
now if we add up all the degrees of freedom in this list taking every particle as off-shell
counting the higgs as its own independent space and finally including an additional set of three
sterile neutrinos then we have 244 real degrees of freedom in total so roughly 250
which is quite a lot well let's check back at this rcho algebra that we're interested in
how big is it it's 64 real dimensions so it seems like we might be stuck how are we going to model 250
roughly 250 real degrees of real off-shell degrees of freedom of the standard model
when all that we have to work with is a 64 real dimensional algebra
one idea is to take a hint from nature nature succeeds in describing the entire human genome
using only four bases a c t and g how does it accomplish this nature accomplishes this not by
considering those four bases alone but instead by considering sequences of the bases
so let's see what would happen if we were to consider sequences of rcho elements one being multiplied onto
another might we be able to describe the fermions and bosons of the standard model inside these sequences
now sequentially multiplying rcho elements onto rcho elements generates something familiar to
mathematicians known as its multiplication algebra
you can think of rcho's full multiplication algebra as being isomorphic as a matrix algebra to
the 32 by 32 complex matrices or to the complex clifford algebra cl10
cl10 it's generated by using 10 objects which we're going to call gamma j and you can think of these 10
gammas as being like the four a c t and g bases of genetic sequences these 10 gammas generate the complex
complex clipper algebra cl10 um so this is cl10 but cl10 with a lot of extra structure due to the fact
that it's generated by rch and o um and this um extra this extra structure will then give us a number of
ways that we can break cl10 up okay so so we're considering these sequences of rcho elements and
it generates the cl10 but it's not just cl10 it's cl10 with extra structure and we're going to use this
extra division algebraic substructure to break cl10 up now it turns out that we can write rcho's full
multiplication algebra as a factorization that is interesting on mathematical grounds
that is we can split up complex cl10 as the real cl08 familiar from the bot periodicity on real
clifford algebras and complex cl2 familiar from bot periodicity of complex clifford algebras
this might relate to what john bias and others call the tenfold way
as a physical interpretation i would like to identify the standard models
off shell states with cl08 and then there's going to be this cl2 factor that's left over
now given the isomorphism between complex cl2 and the real cl30 we might be able to adopt an
interpretation of this cl30 part that um yeah so that the cl30 part represents the rudimentary
algebraic beginnings of a three-dimensional space and that is three legs of some evolving triad
from here we might try to incorporate gravity
so in geometric terms this setup could give us the algebraic beginnings of an 11
an emergent 11-dimensional space where we find ourselves with a three-dimensional spatial
base manifold and a fiber producing standard model degrees of freedom
so cl08 in and of itself is an algebra worth paying attention to for a number of reasons
number one it is roughly the right number of degrees of freedom of the standard model's off-shell states
so cl08 we're looking for about 250 real degrees of freedom and cl08 is 256 real
number two in the world of real clifford algebras cl08 is essentially unavoidable well what do i mean by
unavoidable so let's say that you were to consider the space of all real clifford algebras in the form
of clst here the s and the t can be any integers greater than or equal to zero
so there's an infinite number of these clifford algebras
then bot periodicity tells us that if you were to choose one of the these clsts at random out of
this infinite set then with overwhelming probability the clifford algebra will be of this form
that is cls0 t0 cross cl8 cross cl8 cross cl8 cross cl8 over and over again
so it's going to be overwhelmingly dominated by factors of cl8 so it's in this sense that i mean
to say that cl8 is unavoidable so this touches on a point that i'd like to make about which
mathematical structures we choose when we're building physical theories that is when a theorist
is building a physical model they could choose the prints of mathematical structures that is they could
look for a mathematical structure that is somehow the most distinguished or the most special
or alternatively we might opt instead for a mathematical structure that is the most common
cl8 is an example of a mathematical structure that is the most common at least within the space
of real clifford algebras so we could say that cl8 is special because it is not special
now third reason why i find cl08 interesting is because it looks loosely speaking like we might
be able it might give us a natural incarnation of a fog space so let's say we can indeed describe
a state in the standard model as an element of cl08 and this is what we're going to argue shortly
and this would count as a one particle state
let's say now that we were to take some clifford algebra clst at random then an element in this space
might be viewed as a multi-particle state and here the number of particles in the multi-particle
state would correspond to the number of factors of cl08 that the clifford algebra has
then finally taking superpositions over different size clifford algebras could give us something
along the lines of a bot periodic fog space as we'll start with the zero particle state
then we add in a one particle state the two particle state and so on
we might even include the totality of all real clifford algebras by summing over all possible s and t's
we might also add in a few more details we might add in a few more details
now as a final note i should mention that it may be useful at some point to also consider graded
tensor products in that these might help us tease out fermionic and bosonic behavior
i'm sort of the best of my knowledge this idea of a bot periodic fox space was first introduced here
okay so let's retrace our trajectory we started out by arguing that the safest
possible theory is one that makes the fewest number of assumptions possible we then propose
one such model built from only directed graphs directed algebraic graphs that is we do away with
any additional notion of an underlying space time now when that algebra is chosen to be the complex
quaternions then we find that we can describe all of the lorentz representations of the standard model
in a concise way these lorentz representations are defined by their behavior under discrete symmetries
and now we want to scale this up so when counting all of the off-shell degrees of freedom in the
standard model we find that we need a space that is roughly 250 real degrees of freedom as it turns
out we find a relevant 256 real dimensional space by taking a certain real slice of rcho's multiplication
algebra this cl08 slice is especially interesting for us because it is ubiquitous in the world of real
algebra furthermore it might just supply us with a natural incarnation of a false space
so now we're at the point of describing how standard model degrees of freedom can be embedded inside of
this cl08 so for practical reasons we're going to do this by first analyzing its structure as
at the complexified cl8 level and then we're going to restrict down to the real slice
now it's crucial to note that we're not dealing simply with cl8 but rather cl8 generated by
the division algebras rch and o so we're in fact going to have a lot of additional substructure
here within these algebras and this is what's going to help us break the algebra down
so in our first step we're going to bring to light some important substructure that comes about from
the octoneons so as many people here we know the left multiplication algebra of the octoneons is given
by cl06 and furthermore you may know that it is possible to describe the volume element of this
clifford algebra as a single octonionic imaginary unit so for concreteness we're going to call this
imaginary unit e7 but of course there's an entire sixth sphere of candidates that we could choose for
this imaginary unit so this octonionic substructure is going to single out for us a volume element
expressed in terms of an octonionic imaginary unit now with this octonionic imaginary unit e7 we can
construct projection operators which we're going to call little s and little s star now these projection
operators may be viewed as generalizations of a chirality projector that is going to be that's
familiar to you from the direct algebra now the octonions have this peculiar property that any
octonion multiplying from the right can always be rewritten as chains of octonions multiplying from
the left and so this means that the same octonionic imaginary unit e7 will give us a second pair
of um projection operators namely that which we're going to call capital s and capital s star
so here the the capital r here refers to right multiplication
so this octonionic substructure um of our complex co8 is going to give us two sets of commuting
projection operators and so the question is now well what are these octonionic projectors going to do
for us well they're going to take our complex seal 8 and they're going to partition it into blocks
now there's one curious feature about these blocks you'll notice that these blocks are of various
different sizes the thing that's curious is that these sizes happen to fit the standard model's
particle representations rather closely
incidentally this partitioning is an example of what's known as a purse decomposition
and is detailed uh discussing detailed towards the end of this talk linked here the purse item
potents correspond to projective measurements in quantum theory
so here is the particle content from the standard model that we would like to describe on the left
and it might seem like a small miracle if these representations on the left were to fit tightly
into the blocks on the right hand side after all these blocks sprang up from just a single
octonianic imaginary unit
so you might actually appreciate that we're actually asking for three small miracles
first of all that the division algebras this division algebraic substructure of
of our cl8 is going to somehow single out the symmetries that we see in particle physics
secondly we need these particle representations to fit tightly into the blocks
and finally you may notice that there are 23 irreducible representations here on the left hand side
and it would not be very convincing if each of their transformation rules needed to be specified
individually as we do in the standard model instead what would be much more convincing is if we had a
relatively simple transformation rule that describes how each of these representations transform
that's our wish list and let's see how far we get
so let's start by seeing how these octonianic substructure might single out some symmetries for us
now a natural expectation is that our symmetries are going to respect
these octonian projection operators so we expect that the symmetries are going to commute with the projectors
this then restricts the symmetry generators and our eventual covariant derivatives
to live in the diagonal blocks
now let's consider a linearization of the hermitian action familiar from the beginning of this talk
so just as we had earlier in the c cross h algebra we find that the block splits into two parts
two parts um one being um uh one where did this go um it's going to split into two parts uh one part
is going to be anti-hermission and we'll give a lee algebra and um the other part is going to be
permission and it's going to give a jordan algebra so this means that each of these blocks
um is going to be partitioned into a lee algebra and a jordan algebra
um now the elements in the diagonals should correspond to a covariant derivative
um in our model once oh first i need to say so these uh now these lee algebras um that we just
described um will give give us a set of symmetries that we can consider so the lee algebras that we
find in these blocks are four real dimensional 36 real dimensional 36 real dimensional again
and four real dimensional and the jordan algebras in these blocks are going to be the same size as
those lee algebras okay so now the elements in the diagonals should correspond to a covariant derivative
in our model um once a real slice is taken and um once it's made into a gauge theory
um so that is the pieces that we the pieces that correspond physically to momentum operators and
the pieces that we have um we have pieces that correspond to off-shell gauge bosons including their
polarizations um we furthermore notice that color the color and generation parts of these
the algebras are described by the octoneons um while holicity and isospin um are described by the
quaternions now these lee algebras and jordan jordan algebras are physically significant because
of their expected correspondence to this covariant derivative but they do not match the symmetries
of the standard model gauge group as you can see that we have too many symmetries here
um in fact some of some of them are maybe viewed as symmetries that rotate um octoneons into
quaternions and quaternions into octoneons within these blocks
but we would let our symmetries to respect this division algebraic substructure so let us
restrict down ourselves down to the least sub algebra um
the least sub algebra that forbids these transitions between quaternions and octoneons
when we do this we find that we get two copies of su3 plus u2 plus u2
and note that this result comes from the complex cl8 case when we take the real slice and we're
going to lose half of our degrees of freedom
now you may have noticed that there's a kind of mirror pairing between the algebras
where there's this reflection symmetry that occurs across this purple axis
so this leads to something that we're going to call multiplet mirroring
in the complexified case for every symmetry element on one side of this mirror there's going to be
another independent symmetry on the other side
furthermore we expect that when these blocks are applied to the fermion off diagonals one set is going to
act on the left hand side and the other side and the other one is going to act on the right hand
side of the fermion
what does this multiplet mirror this multiplet mirroring um what is it going to mean physically
physically we find that the octoneonic su3 symmetries
when they act on one side of a fermion they mix possible color degrees of freedom
and when the mirror set of octonionic su3 symmetries act on the other side then they mix possible
generations similarly we find that when certain quaternionic su2 symmetries act on one side of a
fermion then they mix possible core callicities and when the mirror set of quaternionic su2 symmetries
act from the other side then they mix possible isospin states on left-handed particles
um so these are the um the various symmetries that we get in the full complexified cl8
um now the question and so algebraically you can see that they come in these pairs
so this is what we found for the complex cl8 case and so the question is now what happens when we
restrict down to cl08
when we restrict down to cl08 we shave off half the degrees of freedom
in the process we lose half of our lee algebras and half of our jordan algebras on the diagonals
in other words we now have only an su3 plus u2 plus another u2 algebra lee algebra and then we've
got another jordan algebra that's analogous to those
so one way to interpret this situation is to look at these six types of transformation and
to characterize half of them as lee algebraic and the other as jordan algebraic
well how are we going to identify which correspond to lee algebras and which correspond to jordan
algebras one obvious identification is to notice that half of these transformations describe internal
symmetries so namely su3 color su2 left and su2 right so we might identify these with lee algebras
and the other transformations describe mass and spin so we might identify these as jordan algebraic
so address to to address this final item in our wish list um the octonianic substructure of our cl8
does supply us with a natural way to identify certain symmetries and observables that we that
are familiar in particle physics for better or for worse though um the details are close to but not
exactly the same as what we see in the standard model
okay so now that we have these lee algebras and jordan algebras in hand we would like to go after
the last two items in our wish list namely do the standard model representations fit into these
octonianic purse blocks and can we find a simple action that's going to make this happen
well in an attempt to keep things simple a first guess at an action might look like this
where the b and the v are defined at the complexified level and then we add a complex
conjugate in order to have the output that lives in the real cl08 slice
so this is an interesting avenue to explore because it appears to be the simplest possible action
but it does not give us the particle content that we want at least at known energies and that is it's
going to give us the same structure that we see in supersymmetric theories where we have an equal
number of bosons to fermions the standard model though as you may have noticed has more fermionic
degrees of freedom than it does bosonic degrees of freedom so when we use this action we don't get
three linearly independent generations but rather two and we end up instead with extra lepto quarks
and higgs bosons so this action might be troubled from an experimental perspective at least at the
energies that we're interested in
now one might argue that this action is troubled as well from a perspective of aesthetics that is the
octoneons have gave us the second pair of projection operators for free and as you can see this action is
really only making use of one of those pairs the little s projectors so in order to that is in
order to separate out fermions and bosons so said another way we can see that there's a more refined
z2 grading here that that our action can use so as to separate fermions and bosons
so in this case we're going if we if we obey this z2 structure then we're going to end up with
more fermions and bosons and perhaps if we're lucky even three linearly independent generations
well here is one such action on these off diagonals that will define fermions and bosons with respect
to this more refined z2 grading here the projection operators p plus and p minus taking into account this
time the octoneonic imaginary unit coming from both the left and the right
now in order to satisfy the fact that that this is a real slice we perform our action on a set of
carefully chosen representative objects in the complex seal eight and then we add in the complex
conjugate at the end which ensures that we're living in the real cl08 slice
so now we're ready to answer the following questions do the particle representations of the
standard model fit into these octoneonic purse blocks and using this action do they transform
in a way that is consistent with the particle physics that we know
well first let's start with three generations of left-handed quarks
as a vector space it so happens that they fit perfectly into these into this subspace in green
now under this action we find that these dark green blocks do indeed transform as left-handed quarks
next we find that left-handed leptons fit perfectly as vector spaces into this subspace
and furthermore under our action these light green blocks do transform as left-handed leptons
finally these uh three uh three generations of right-handed quarks fits perfectly into these dark
blue subspaces and they transform as do right-handed quarks so now we're at the point where we've
covered almost all of the off diagonal blocks and the only fermions that we have left to embed are the
right-handed right-handed leptons and we find that this last off diagonal block um the left last
off diagonal blocks do transform as right-handed leptons but they only give us one generation
not three so we're missing and embedding for two generations of right-handed leptons
okay so let's leave those remaining fermions for now and move on to the bosons
next we find an object that is expected to eventually transform as a leptons for momentum
this was not part of the standard model's um particle content that we listed earlier but it
does appear within the momentum space representation of a standard model's covariant derivative so it
could be relevant for us now in the next block we find a similar form momentum for quarks together
with a further with further representations transforming under the su3 adjoint um so
in the context of a gauge theory these are expected to transform as do a full set of gluons
now in this bottom diagonal block we have elements transforming under the su2 left adjoint
and so in the context of the gauge theory we would expect that these degrees of freedom to correspond to
electroweak gauge bosons although we in fact have too many of these representations here this time
so if we were to stop now we see that we have uh 232 real degrees of freedom uh behaving uh in accordance
with the standard model under the group su3 cross su2 cross u1 or z6 um so this is a majority of the 252 that we
would need for the standard model if we were to include momentum operators and three generations
of right-handed neutrinos so when i say a majority i mean to say that we're at 92 percent
furthermore we can see some desired patterns emerge in particular we can notice that the bosonic
objects like four momenta engaged bosons live in the diagonal blocks colored here in orange
in fact those extra four momentum blocks seem to be important because now the diagonal blocks appear
to be describing a momentum space version of a covarian derivative
if we look at the off diagonal blocks this is where the fermionic degrees of freedom are found
now we're still missing two generations of right-handed leptons yet on the other hand
we seem to have too many elements transforming as do electroweak bosons
so could there be a natural way to alleviate this tension
what i will point out is that these subspaces were based on one particular octonionic imaginary
unit as you'll remember e7 however if we finally introduce to this electroweak sector another
octonian imaginary unit orthogonal to the first then it can act to further split this electroweak block
the introduction of a second octonionic imaginary unit is something that we could anticipate
because we expect this choice of octonionic imaginary unit to vary from point to point over what will be
an emergent spacetime manifold
oddly enough when we do this the diagonal block um now provides us with a suitable
a suitable space for these electroweak gauge bosons so now it fits the electroweak gauge bosons
perfectly and the off diagonals now have exactly the right dimension to describe the missing two
generations of right-handed leptons so if we can get this electroweak sector working in this way
we will we will then have covered a hundred percent of the standard models three generations of fermions
and its gauge bosons on the algebraic side there would remain only eight real degrees of freedom left
in the algebra um an obvious possibility for these eight degrees of freedom would be two higgs fields
one corresponding to su2 left and the other corresponding to su2 right however it's too early
to say more about this at this point okay in summary so in this talk i ventured my current best
guess to the question what is the universe made of and how does it work hence we set out to build a
model based on the smallest number of initial inputs possible this led to the proposal of doing away
with the qft picture of fields on top of a spacetime manifold and instead we propose a single structure
of directed graphs however we quickly found that these directed graphs are not going to provide us
with enough information to be able to explain why spacetime has three plus one dimensions
so from this point we propose that these directed graphs should originate from the operations of an
algebra perhaps a clever choice of algebra could lead to an emergent spacetime that is three plus
one dimensional with this in mind we then started looking into the algebra of the complex quaternions
for one the complex quaternions have a group of inner automorphisms given by so31
moreover conway knew back in the 1930s that most of the lorentz representations that we now happen to
use in the standard model can be described succinctly with this algebra we then show that the full set
of lorentz representations of the standard model can be completed by considering the discrete symmetries
of the algebra from these discrete symmetries we found that actions of c cross h on itself under which
the lorentz representation in the standard model appear as stable subspaces these generalized
notions the notion of an ideal one might expect that such generalized generalized ideals to emerge from
the algebra given that they survive no matter which element of the algebra is applied to them
now at this point we emphasize that the internal degrees of freedom of the standard model had not
yet been accounted for so we propose extending c cross h so as to include the four um finite dimensional
norm division algebras over our the dixon algebra however this new rch algebra still has only 64 real
dimensions whereas the number of off-shell degrees of freedom in the standard model
including a separate higgs and three sterile neutrinos adds up to 244 real degrees of freedom
but nature then supplied us with a root um a root out of this dilemma namely that we can consider
sequences of rcho elements multiplying rcho elements the multiplication algebra gives us an
incarnation of the complex clifford algebra cl10 and curiously enough the cl10 may be factorized
into cl08 and complex cl2 which are the complex clifford algebras familiar from real and complex bot periodicity
of the fact that we can see that we can see if we're lucky this might give us a root into something
that john bison others called the tenfold way now from this factorization we proposed that a single
we propose an algebraic starting point for what might emerge as a three-dimensional space corresponding
to cl30 and a standard model fiber corresponding to 08 cl08
we then emphasize the perspective that cl08 is worth paying attention to because it is an unavoidable
structure in the world of real clifford algebras we then pointed out how it may lead to a natural
incarnation of a fox base for standard model states from here we set out to concretely embed the standard
model's off-shell degrees of freedom into a cl08 that is generated by the division algebras
we made use of a single octoneonic imaginary unit to partition complex cl8 into blocks
and restricted within these diagonal blocks we found lee algebras and jordan algebras corresponding to
elements of a rudimentary um covariant derivative we furthermore restricted these algebras by forbidding
quaternions to transform into octoneons within the blocks and then we took um a then we took
the cl0 real cl08 slice and this left us within su3 plus u2 plus u2 lee algebra and a corresponding
jordan algebra now when acting on fermionic space we find that these lee algebras and jordan algebras
they seem to come in these pairs um and this causes the fermions to exhibit what we call
multiplet mirroring namely an algebraic correspondence between three colors and three generations
between core helicity and isospin left between lepton helicity and isospin right
and we then identified a relatively simple action that respects um a z2 grading with bosons on the
diagonals and fermions on the off diagonals
and when restricting this action down to the standard models lee algebra we found that 92 percent
of expected states transforming under these symmetries in agreement with the standard model
we then pointed out that it may be possible to pick up the last eight percent if the electroweak
sector breaks um such a breaking might be affected by a second octonian imaginary unit that is orthogonal to
the first there are eight real degrees of freedom left over in this cl08 it may be possible to
associate these with the left-handed higgs and right-handed higgs however these details are beyond
the scope of this talk and that's all i have to say okay great thank you i think that's a historic
lecture i'm glad it's been recorded we will visit it again and again also because i think it
has quite a few things which are not yet written down so very exciting thanks so much cool
can i just say cool thank you for that was an absolutely surpassingly clear overview i i've
rarely have ever heard i mean such a wonderfully clear and at the same time you know dense exposition
of so so much new material um laid out so clearly thank you very much well thank you i appreciate it
so the talk is open for questions kindly use the raise hand feature so as questions come in
i just wanted to mention i think it's very good if you have two higgs it's like predicting uh one more
higgs which i think is very good i wouldn't be daunted by the fact that we are just seeing one right now
and that you are predicting one too many i think that's a good thing so i hope we get that across to
particle physicists so vatsalia uh let me please uh uh please unmute yourself um hi um it was a very
nice job thank you for the talk um thank you i have three questions um like if you could go go to the
slide where you have this uh the table of all the representations um so let's say this yes okay so
here you have uh p mu which is a space-time vector and uh like it does not transform under internal gate
symmetries so do like is it is the interpretation that p mu provides us like vectors in space time
um which is out of this representation that's a good question so the only um i wasn't dealing at
all with um space-time symmetries um yet at this point so the only um symmetries that i um was analyzing
this under um was the um the su3 cross su2 cross u1 symmetry so the gauge gauge symmetries um and so
under that then these are just singlets and so that's consistent with with what we would expect
um it will be another step in order to get um space-time symmetries into this model and i expect it
to be non-trivial uh another question i have is like from this model it seems that the three
generations of fermions they are absolutely identical um is there any way to differentiate
between them because we know that one generation is much more stable than the other two that's a
yeah again a really good question so actually there's one of the things that um that i like about
this model is that the the three generations are not showing up as identical so um the left-handed
the the left-handed ones um are so this is also something that um i've so this is a good point that
you're making um it would be nice if um in our particle models that somehow the three generations
come have they come up um they they're they emerge as being algebraically different from each other so
that you can so that they can have different properties um and um in this uh so in this model
the the three generations do come up as different from each other they're um it's they're kind of
scattered over the off diagonals the only um symmetry there are here between the three generations
are the left-handed ones um they seem to be exact copies of each other but the right-handed ones
um they're kind of dispersed in different places in the off diagonals um so if there is a
difference i would expect it to come from that thank you and you had a third question
uh we go john please go ahead hi cool thanks very much um do i understand you from somebody fairly
new to this do i understand that you're suggesting the imaginary units in the octonians are somehow higgs
fields and if that's the right picture how does that relate to the higgs that we know already
or is it can you can you i didn't hear the beginning of your question can you repeat it
yeah so i think you're suggesting that these um imaginary units in the octonians are somehow higgs
fields is that is that what you're suggesting and if so how do they relate to the higgs that we already know
about right so i i wouldn't say that the way that they're appearing here is um is as the octonian imaginary
units um so the the octonian imaginary units gave us or it gave us these blocks but i wouldn't have
identified it as the higgs um the way that they so if the x so the this is still to be worked out
because the the electroweak part is is the the part that is um still needs some steps in order to be
completed but the way that it's looking right now the extra degrees of freedom that are not yet
accounted for actually um live in the su2 left adjoint and the su2 right adjoint so if they were to be
higgs they they wouldn't be um at least at first sight they don't look like they would be um
the same as the higgs that we have in the standard model um it's just a different uh a different
representation there they would have to be i'm not exactly sure how this should work out um yet i
i think in order to get um the electroweak part to kind of break in the way that i would like it to i
think this um we need to really uh move beyond just looking at the representations um of this algebra
and rather like actually turn this into a gauge theory and um have this um this octonian e7 vary
from point to point and see what happens okay thanks okay thank you thank you uh davian please unmute yourself
go ahead so i just want to follow up on your answer there cole did i hear you say that your
extra degrees of freedom correspond to two adjoint su2s that's what it that's what it looks like at
first sight but of course there's going i can see already there's going to be more like once this is
built as a gauge theory there's going to be more details about how this um these uh electric weak
bosons are going to um kind of break um kind of emerge from these bottom blocks and again just
following up are those the only adjoint degrees of freedom that are showing up here um well there's
uh so there's gluons in the um in the in a couple things to say but there's gluons in the top blocks
that are the adjoint under su3 um so the gluons are in there and there's um and the w uh the uh
electric weak bosons in the bottom block um one thing i should mention is that it looks like
there's um uh that the electric weak are are kind of entirely in the bottom block and the and the
gluons are are in the top half space but actually when you take the real slice um there's a
symmetrization that happens and there's and they kind of end up being spread over both so this looks
like it's um asymmetric um across across that axis but actually it's not as um asymmetric in it as
ad hoc as it might look at first sight okay thank you for that clarification no problem great david go
ahead please well thanks for the excellent talk so i just had a question about potentially getting a
graviton in the c cross h cross o model so uh as we know a spin two graviton is it would be a tensor
product of c vectors so i was curious do you think when we take that tensor product and we're working
with c plus h would it be a tensor product over complex numbers such that we get c cross h cross h
um i was just an idea i had when i was looking at this a while ago but i i didn't uh finish looking
in there i was just curious if you hadn't thought the that's also a good question so i this is
something that i'm just starting to look into and there was so there's different there's different
ways to go about this project and the first way that or one of the ways that we've spent a lot of
time looking at it was you start with the complex cl8 and um there's there's kind of two obvious
routes you can go the cl08 route which i like because of the um the because of its connection to
the bot periodicity but then you can there's also um a jordan algebraic route where you look at the
hermitian uh real slice which is a different real slice um now in in that kind of line of thinking
there's actually a really natural way or what what looks to me like it could be a natural way to to
build um a fear bind and then actually that this whole thing might be interpreted as a generalized
field line and so you might be able to just kind of build everything off of that um so that's actually
what i looks to me to be kind of like the easiest route to try to get to bring gravity in um this
bot period this other real slice that i'm presenting today is new to me um and so i'm not exactly i haven't
thought about it long enough about how exactly um to bring gravity in except for the fact that you can
notice that the complex cl2 might be reinterpreted as a cl3 zero and maybe this this could give space
some time but somehow but um it's not as obvious to me in this case like how how you would go about
uh bringing gravity in okay can i can i respond to that cool you seem to be having an extra su2
if i understood you correctly um for me that's gravity actually you know the su2l and su2r this is what
we have been elaborating in our papers i mean your gravity sort of hiding in plain sight because um
does it will it
will it will it affect all particles like will it will it act on like gauge bosons for example
or like will you uh the the thing is that uh so i have essentially something like two copies of cl8
uh data which is cl9 thought of as a direct sum of two copies of cl8 one that corresponds to
two left-handed chiral fermions rather to the right-handed chiral fermions the two higgs i have two higgs
like you have the standard model higgs is giving mass to the left-handed particles the second higgs is
essentially giving electric charge to the right-handed particles so gravity has a symmetric
uh role of course i come with extras i don't just get drive general relativity i have a mirror copy of
the standard models su2 su3 color cross su2l cross u1 uh electromagnetic or hypercharge has a copy su3
graph process u2 r which is general relativity and u across a u1 graph
does the higgs end up coupling left-handed particles to right-handed particles in your
yes yes yes yes yes yes the the the two the two that's why the two it's important to have the
second higgs and it seems in several ways that the extras that you are seeing which we are trying to
accommodate would fit in nicely if already at this stage we start taking care of gravity along with
standard model instead of leaving that for later so my my knife guess is that that you're almost there
you're almost there but to exactly get from 92 percent to 100 percent now is the time to you know
bring in gravity right away and that is where things seem to start falling into place and
uh so that's why i wanted to ask you have you looked at having two copies of cl8 um
that would give me 512. for me that's good because very close to e8 cross e8 496
and but then um don't you then have a doubling of the number of degrees of freedom
you know i have you're saying i have too many i have too many no one cl8 go for the left-handed
particles which are singlets of su2r the other cl8 for right-handed particles which are singlets of su2n
the gravity is the right-handed counterpart of the weak force somehow that comes in very strongly
yes i haven't thought about uh using the su2 rate for
gravity um
you know if you remember peter white's paper on euclidean twister quantization he says the same
thing that you know su2r is adequate for constructing general relativity oh he did have something he was
also using ashtacar yes yes i'm saying the same thing except that that is euclidean and that's
something we have to worry about euclidean versus lorenzian but we we can come to that i don't think
that's necessarily insurmountable but uh you know like you know when you break the electroweak sector
for me the counterpart of the electroweak sector is su2r cross what i call you another u1 which i call
u1 graph so there are additional predictions but you know i wouldn't say they are not there
i maybe we have to think what is su3 graph doing u1 graph is very much behaving like mond so for me
there's no there's no mysterious dark matter it is really you know modified the newtonian dynamics on
larger galactic scales and uh somehow that seems to go well i think sorry i think hands are up i should
do gents please unmute you so thanks god thanks for the response yeah yeah no my pleasure hey yeah so
yeah thanks uh great great talk thanks for the rundown and and and everything so uh cool i say i have to
follow up on that uh breaking the electroweak sector with an additional octoneionic phase that's that's
cool um just a very quick remark at the very beginning you you mentioned the uh current uh uh
investigation in that field i'll and i'll just add and maybe you said it that gursey and granadine
also worked on the exceptional jordan algebra for this kind of things and i mean it's it's contained
in at least one or two of those references that you had and uh but again yeah it's points again back
all the way into the 1970s so they've been working on that cool stuff was it a three generation uh
project that they were working on i i would have to dig up the details and i'm now i'm actually
curious about digging up the details they didn't just do the uh exceptional jordan algebras they also
did other variations of on top of jordan algebra so anyway but next to their su3 uh you know uh uh
uh uh algebraic uh uh strong force anyway just wanted to to to add that here and they they also
use uh pierce decomposition then on on the exceptional jordan algebra to isolate where they think but you
know i mean so it's just amazing it probably was a three imagine it probably was a three generation
effort because like if you've got the exceptional journal why wouldn't you why don't you go for three
generations yeah yeah yeah yeah it can't have been i haven't seen those papers but i'd be curious to
i'd be curious to see them i'll i'll find it um i think you're the person actually that that you
were the person that introduced me to uh granite and garcia in the in the first place anyway so
yeah that was cool 13 years ago they owe you that you're their best advocate
uh no no jeffrey is on the call here too so don't forget him oh i said you're you're you're their
best advocate i said that you're that that you that you like you advocate for them yeah yeah sure
thank you david jackson please go ahead hi thanks to jinder and uh thanks carl very much for the talk
i like very much the talk and there's the introduction particularly um so you mentioned
um going beyond um space time and you went via directed graphs and then that originating from
algebras and then motivating particular algebra leading to the standard model i lost track of where
the directed graphs come in was that just a kind of a stepping stone or how does it connect i don't
know anything about graph theory but does that do with building the space time or where does the
directed graph kind of come into it well why not just get to the algebra oh i see um well the yeah
the original idea was was basically to take something that looks like a simon uh fineman like
some over paths but like a discretized version of that um just as something that could be
it started out just as like literally as a game as like what's the what's the simplest possible
thing you could imagine that could still capture some things that we see in nature and so that's
where the directed graphs idea came from and then from there didn't like i don't see an obvious way
to explain why there's three plus one dimensions so that so making these things algebraic was was um
a way that you know maybe if if this if it's um if the uh say for example um uh propagation along an
edge could be given by multiplication um by the algebra and uh so that would give you yeah a directed edge
and then uh for example like um joining of two edges at a vertex could be given by addition so
there could the the graphs could kind of correspond to operations in an algebra um that's just one
way that it might kind of materialize but um okay if you think about that so in terms of going beyond
space time where where does um the kind of extended space time how does that um get constructed i mean
how do you get space time out of this yes yeah i'm so i um that's a good question so um
i'm not so yeah i guess so one thing is that these things will naturally be uh lorenz representation so
you kind of already have part of what you need um i wouldn't necessarily go as far as point curry
because i don't i i don't want to kind of assume like a whole manifold um uh but kind of building a
model like building actually building up a model and getting uh getting the kind of gravity aspects of
it to me seemed like the hardest part so that's what i figured would be best to do last the thing that
seemed like the most straightforward in order to kind of tackle this um you have to start somewhere
and the the the idea was um to find like do the easiest problems first learn what you can from
those parts and then use what you learn from that to kind of inform yourself on what to do with the
more difficult parts of the problem like getting an emergent space time or describing gravity and so the
thing that seemed to me to be the most obvious well-defined question to try to answer is um can
you find an algebra where you reproduce the representations that we find in the standard model
by just having this algebra act on itself um and that's you know been a project that's obviously taken
you know i've been working on that on that aspect of it for a long time now um but i'm now at the point
where you know i need to start um actually thinking of this and now as a gauge theory and then trying
seeing kind of what can be done if you if it's possible to incorporate gravity but um this is
yeah something that i'm just at the point of starting to do now sure great okay that helps a lot
yeah thanks very much karl thank you my pleasure thank you so maybe if you it's i would like to respond to
both david jackson and to pole because it's a very interesting point the time now to bring in space
time the way i landed up with the octaneons was because i was concerned with this question that
quantum theory depends on classical space time and that is not good except as an approximation because the
quantum superposition principle disallows the point structure of space time that we take for granted in
r4 even in quantum theory at low energies so that is when i realized that one of the ways to get over this
commutative space time is to look at beyond real numbers the division algebras which have non-commutativity
already built in the cotaneons and octaneons and there's a very important hint coming from the
cotaneons when we look at the dirac equation so it's worth asking what are these gamma matrices doing
that look very mysterious uh to describe fermions in 4d minkowski space time i cannot use klein gordon i
must use the dirac equation then i realized i learned from atia in one of his lectures he said that the
dirac equation was actually first discovered by hamilton not by dirac why because if you take a
cotaneonic space uh labeled by the four octaneonic directions the gradient operator on this space is
actually the dirac operator so when we put in gamma matrices into the dirac operator we are actually
trading them in for cotaneonic space so my electron doesn't even live in a minkowski space time it lives
in that cotaneonic space and that's already a big hint and as you rightly said the cotaneons and the
accompanying sl2c are not big enough to accommodate color in the quarks so we know do the next best
thing instead of considering the gradient operator on the cotaneonic space i consider the gradient
operator in an octaneonic space with that just turns out to be the dirac equation in 10d space time
uh no in the cotaneonic case okay it's four and four or maybe four and six and when you go to the octaneon
it is 10 dimensional space time so the because i need to remove the r4 spacetime manifold from quantum
theory i want to replace it by a non-commutative manifold whose coordinates so to say are labeled by the
octaneons octaneon that is my way of looking at why octaneons are so important they're important
for quantum theory and because they label space-time coordinates the curvature of that space-time is
indeed gravity as well as the standard model fiber as you talked of you have a fiber cross uh for
f sl2c structure that's already there in the octaneonic space and the way space-time to answer david
jackson's question how does space-time emerge from this in quantum theory there is no space-time there
just is octaneonic space when i take the classical limit actually quantum to classical limit as in quantum
theory then there's a certain averaging process which converts quaternions to minkowski spacetime and
octaneons to minkowski spacetime across the fiber on which the standard model gauge fields live i i
wanted to use this opportunity to give my picture of why i landed up with octaneons and
uh how what do they have to do with spacetime so if you could get gravity in at this stage i think we
are done already uh it's uh easier said than done i think maybe it's easy for you no it's not easy but
i learned from you i mean i used your cl6 for one generation and then but by the way i wanted to ask you
when you said a second imaginary octaneonic unit orthogonal to the question are you not already
going to split by octaneons split by octaneons cl7 the cl7 algebra cl3 is split by quaternion cl2
plus cl2 cl7 is cl6 plus cl6 and that's algebra no like you know like in your in your video lectures
i don't think i'm using a second i'm not using a second copy like a second copy of the
of the space um it's more that um so it's kind of
it's kind of you know a similar idea that we see in gauge theories where
uh things vary from point to point and so this this frame like um so if you see the
um this picture on my screen here where i've got the the blocks are they're all defined by single
octonian imaginary unit but you would expect um that along the graph or along what becomes like
an emergent space time that um that e7 is allowed to vary from point to point and um so just as you know
things very engaged theories this this kind of whole frame is allowed to to vary um and then you end up
with these breaking of the blocks when basically something with one frame kind of makes contact
with um with another object that is uh has got a frame of based on a different imaginary unit um then
you might expect to have these these um why don't you work with the split bio octonians why i emphasize
that you know here we have a puzzle here why is the standard model uh you know left-handed why is it
singlet under uh the right-handed fermion the answer to that is because it is uh if you extend to include
gravity you get gravity you get gravity is the doublet under right-handed fermion then a singlet
for left-handed fermions and the bioctonians very naturally have that structure cl7 and cl3 being the
only two uh algebra clifford algebras which have two irreps these two pinners and they are parity
reversing yeah i think of cl7 as two copies of cl6 a direct sum one copy for the left-handed fermions
one for the right-handed fermions and things why would they have um why would one have an su2 symmetry
and the other one not but i guess you're saying that the the su2 symmetry for rate is you're interpreting
as gravity yes yes yes okay yes so is this so just a question so in your um in your models like do you
have one picture that um is it all part of one big coherent picture or do you have um do you have kind
of different models no i think in this latest paper when we try to derive the ckm matrix uh we feel we have
beginning to reach a coherent picture so i'm somewhat closer to cl9 than cl10 right now cl9 i think of as
two copies of cl8 the first copy our brand is cl6 cross cl2 the second copy also cl6 cross cl2 and
uh uh yeah something else very puzzling has opened up from here that uh so with one cl2 i associate weak
isospin the other cl2 uh with the lawrence space and then gravity it seems as if the weak isospin is
coming with its own copy of a 4d space time so it's like as if there's a cl3 giving us 6d space time
before a left right symmetry breaking and the left right symmetry breaking is giving me two copies of
4d space time it seemed to be different as as if just as gravity is the curvature of our 4d space time
the weak force is the geometry of the other 4d space time so weak force looking more like a space
time symmetry than uh internal do you see um do you see any reason why um so like with the internal
symmetries we end up with unitary symmetries whereas the space-time symmetries um are not do you do you find
any uh explanations as to why is it like why why should it be a gauge theory uh no just like with so
with the um this is something that keeps me up at night is like why do internal symmetries we get
these unitary symmetries uh whereas space-time symmetries uh um will be you know like loren's group or
like they they they're from a purely algebraic point of view um okay my picture my picture for
that is you know if you know that i talk of these so-called atoms of space-time matter where the
one space-time matter atom is the fermion along with all the bosonic degrees of freedom
so there is one copy of this non-commutative space-time this larger space-time which contains
internal symmetries for every so-called space-time matter atom and classical space-time is has to be
constructed after symmetry breaking now i don't have a classical space-time with this uh lorenzian
classical structure before symmetry breaking so before symmetry breaking gravity truly looks like a gauge
theory with you know like like a su2r which might answer your question later on it starts looking
different in the emergent classical limit but before symmetry breaking uh gravity is really truly like
a young male's or you can call it pre-gravitation i don't know if i'm answering you but maybe we can
you can bring i think david has a comment david can you please uh say it out
david yeah go ahead please uh unmute yourself
hey uh is this comment on what i was saying about cl8 yeah i mean um right so cl8 does have uh 256
dimensions and e8 has 248 so it's it's natural to ask the question oh does does e8 fit in cl8 but
uh algebraically it does not but um i believe the chant has done some work that looks at connecting
the gossip polytope which is the root polytope uh to cl8 i mean maybe uh one point is that the e8
root lattice is in eight dimensions um so yeah i was just mentioning that yeah since the audio is not very
clear david i'll just read out your comment david says i believe cl8 is connected more to the gosset
polytope in the e8 lattice than the e8 algebra itself so perhaps looking into dashant's work in relation to
cl8 and the roots of the e8 polytope could help find connections between cole story on cl8 and arbitrary
models using e8 in some way okay thank you i i keep this in mind i i need to understand what's being
said here maybe i could ask you cole where do you see e8 fitting in your story and also the exceptional
jordan algebra i mean does it have some connection with cl8 in some way um that's a good question
i've got yeah that's a good question for for both of them um it's not something that i've uh that i've
spent a huge amount of time on with either of them um i've got a long list of projects that i would like
to work on and um they are included in that list but they're not something that i've ever kind of come
around to doing um but there's yeah i've got kind of ideas for both that i would love to to kind of
explore but i um at this point i don't have a lot to say because i haven't um i haven't spent a lot
of time on them thank you so i general question i think the general question of like knowing what
mathematical structure to choose is a really difficult one um he like no matter which mathematical
structure you choose you have to ask like why did why would nature have chosen this thing over
over something else and but you know the way i like to come i like to try to like pick ubiquitous
structures like things that are kind of unavoidable somehow and that's why i you know i like the
division algebras is that they kind of they're kind of everywhere and that's also the motivation
behind this bot periodicity stuff is that it's they're kind of every they're unavoidable very
interesting fox space from bot periodicity i think that's a really nice idea i definitely hadn't
thought of it i think it would be very useful so you regarding what you said you know about picking
up which mathematical structure to choose for me what's more important is the physics question
that i'm asking that comes first and then i go looking for a structure so in that context i wanted
to mention you know how i was in got interested in this mass quantization question is to note that the
mass ratios of the first generation down quark up quark and the electron the mass ratios are nine is to
four is to one and the square root of masses are in the ratio three is to two is to one whereas the
electric charge rate which is of one is to two is to three for me this very striking so motivated by
your results that there is charge quantization i introduced for the right-handed sector the second
cl8 there is again a u1 quantum number but for the right-handed particles my u1 charge is not electric
charge it is square root of mass so i interchange the location of the down quark and the electron
the down quote becomes a singlet under su3 grab which is with the right-handed sector the electron is
now a triplet under su3 grab but it is very useful to get in this u1 charge which is square root of mass
because someday i need to explain why the down up and the electron have square root mass ratios of
three is to two is to one it's telling us something i mean if if you found charge quantization your way
i would definitely do the next thing and hence conclude that mass quantization
is also from a u1 number and then interestingly the u1 right-handed u1 square root mass number is the
same for all three generations to begin with the reason the mass ratios look different is because we
make all our measurements using electric charge eigenstates when those mass eigenstates has written a
superposition of electric charge eigenstates the masses start to look funny and even then the first
generation mass ratio always remains simple so i say this because i think you you are very you have
almost all the same kind of structures i realized after listening to your talk and i think why i would
seriously considering bringing square root mass in right away as any other u1 charge analogous to
electric charge okay so so the the thing that you're claiming is that there's um that there there
are is it the there's four is it a neutrino electron or i guess it's a electron down quarks and up
quarks and it's the mass ratios of those in my right in my right-handed sector there are three sterile
neutrinos one sterile neutrino right-handed sterile neutrino is the idempotent on which i built the
right chiral fermions and the first excitation is now not the down quark it is the electron which is a su3
grab triplet next comes the up quark same as in your classification and the singlet is now the down
quark the down quark and the sterile neutrino are singlets of su3 grab whereas the electron and the
right-handed electron and the right-handed up quark are triplets of su3 grab okay so the so the but the
the claim i was asking so the claim is that um that is the um the mass ratios for all four of those
types of particles for the first generation is that right are they're good yeah so well the neutrino
as of now seems to me to be massless the reason for neutrino flavor oscillation something other than
mass that we can argue separately so the mass the square root mass ratios for the sterile neutrino
for the electron for the up quark and the down quark and now zero one third two third one
is the same pattern as you have for the electric charge but i switch deliberately switch the position
of the electron and the down quark okay i i haven't seen it yet but i like um i do have to i still do have
to look at it yeah thank you thank you david you want to say something more uh
oh c cross o cross o are curious
yeah if i use c cross o cross o as this complex split bio octonians
okay please uh we still have time another 10 minutes if you have any comments
uh i actually we have a participant hillary c could you kindly uh i thought what you're saying
would look very interesting uh could you kindly come up and say what you're saying
um i'm not sure it's actually as interesting as you seem to think it is um i just speculated that
maybe there are two hicks but if we can't tell them apart we would be none the wiser
uh these would have two different one would be um under uh would would transform under su2 left and
the other one under su2 right okay um yeah they would be different yeah and by the way for me the
one of the higgs is charged well the the new higgs the non-standard model higgs is actually electrically
charged i think particle physicists have to say something about it right because i mean i was
wondering you know you can have something that in terms of the structure is a different separate
thing but if there's no procedure or measurement that you could define that you could do in an
accelerator that would allow you to tell them apart then it wouldn't show up in the data but from what
people are saying this would be detectable if you got left versus right or i mean if it's charged
it would stick out like a sore thumb surely i mean unless it's very very massive i suppose but
i mean higgs is heavy maybe the other one is even heavier i don't know i mean i'm a quantum
information theorist okay so one other useful lesson that i saw in this algebra studies for me at
least the higgs is composite most certainly so it seems to be made of the very fermions to which
it is supposed to give masses cole have you seen something like compositeness of the higgs yeah yeah i
know that there's composite higgs models out there but um yeah again it's it's not something i've spent a
lot of time on different higgs models jens has the question is there a hand up yes yes jens please
let me please unmute yourself yeah okay emma can you hear me yeah uh yeah i just want to quickly so um
with mass and so in conventional physics today we think of energy momentum properties uh as
quadratic forms or quadratic types to be conserved between equivalent frames of reference so when you
talk about square roots of mass so does that mean that you're looking at fourth order conserved
properties between the equivalent frames of reference seems so seems so yes also interestingly the
square root of mass comes with both signs mass is positive but when i take the square root
it has plus minus square root m and my understanding is that's how i would define matter versus antimatter
matter has square root m positive antimatter has square root m negative it is always puzzling for me that when
i call something as matter particles it has positively charged particles like the you know the down quark
and the up quark and it has negatively charged particles like the electron so clearly the sign of the electric
charge is not a dynamical variable which discriminates matter from antimatter whereas this
the sign of square root mass very nicely you know tells me so right yeah so so i'm certainly sympathetic
to exploring in that direction i just want to point out that today a lot of people find spinners useful
for the description of nature and uh they require only quadratic uh conserved properties so uh if you're
saying that we we have to look at something other than spinners for fundamental particles that's a that's a
a big two ways to of looking at it firstly the square root of mass the little i know about
supersymmetry makes way i mean it comes there too right because you the square of the supersymmetry
operators what gives you the space-time operator of the dirac operator so already in some sense there's a hint of a
hint of a square root mass there and uh yeah yeah and the way to my understanding cycle makes spinners is
the octanionic algebra acts on itself so again i would think that you know you're quadratic or bilinear in
the octanion if you want to make a spinner and if i associate mass with the dirac spinner i have to then talk of
square root mass at the octanion level square root m into root m you get a m for the spinner
that that that's how i am inclined to yeah so so the way i understood it you when you when you pointed
out this year that the real co2 for for gravity you are understanding it in this sense and then
i you know i think as mathematical implementation not spinners anymore but fourth order concert
properties and conversely if you want to stay with spinners then i think cold's concern is like well
what does this real co2 tool everything else in your representation very interesting thing that
the klein-gordon equation is quadratic in mass m square but the source term for einstein equations linear in the
mass it's very striking right the energy momentum is not m squared it's m and that again seems to tie
up with you know that it's like taking an underlying theory with square root m squaring it and then
arriving at gravity maybe you don't have to convince me about this at all so yeah thank you i appreciate you
talking about it thank you thank you i think david i'll read out his comment cross now and a
collaborator looked at obtaining fermionic lagrangians from klein-gordon with the first order constraint
the fields obtained there seem to be a field redefinition from standard ones by square root m
okay thanks you're using not sure really i'll try to see this paper longer good 2012 yeah
thank you thank you thank you god you would like to add something you could finish in time that was
nice yes oh yeah just barely i think it was only five minutes over so it was not as nearly as bad as
i expected um no i just wanted to say thank you to everybody for showing up um and you know for your
questions it's yeah this is so far been a really friendly conference and um so how do you make
contact with quantum field theory i mean if you want to work with octaneons and quantum field theory
how would you go about it
um that's a good question because i you know would really like to start from this like
from this really rudimentary um picture of um algebraic operations and to kind of come up with
something that resembles quantum field theory and no limit is um obviously not trivial but um i did like
i do have ideas for you know there's a lot of things that you know kind of need to be constructed
um when you're starting with such basic objects um and yeah i certainly do have ideas about that but
uh you know again this is kind of right at the point this is kind of where i'm at in my research
right now is to start to yeah so maybe i took this opportunity to ask professor steve adler if you are
there steve i had a question for you steve are you there
i think steve's not there because he has looked a lot at quaternionic quantum mechanics he has a book
on it so i wanted to ask what he thought of the extension to octaneons but i think i i'm not sure he's
there right now yeah so yeah david also made a comment in the in the uh chat and uh just about
a paper that uh me and i uh wrote for one generation that um that you uh um so there there is a connection
there to to qft um so it's possible like it is possible there's kind of an obvious thing that we can
do which is um is that you know the octonians or like the the division algebras algebras acting on
themselves are you know going to give you uh group representations and so you can you know you can
build a qft and just use that algebraic structure to replace the representations that we use in the
standard model so that's certainly something that can be done but um yeah so i think you kind of like
on a on a bigger level like what i you know what you really love to do is start from something
really super simple and um and earlier on in your talk you referred to this sociological pushback
against i think part of the resistance which i also was told is what can you calculate from for
quantum field theory like can you for example tell what's the g what's the g minus two of the
muon do you get a result different from the standard model so those kind of questions
maybe the reason that is we we are not doing dynamics yet we are still looking at the algebraic
structure of the standard model but if they are interested in questions like you know calculate
something like qft does sure if there well if there is some prediction if there's some uh you know
prediction that um made you even if you could yeah there's a there'd be a couple ways to to go about
it um yeah there's a lot to say uh about that um kind of what sociological and um but yeah if somebody
had a had a huge breakthrough um you know where they predicted something that is not known from the
standard model then then that you know that would certainly change the story i i that's where i would
push for calculating values of the fundamental counts that's one thing they cannot do and one thing which
we may have opportunity for in my opinion um uh so yes michael uh yes thanks very much to agenda um i
really hesitate to put this question because i have such no background in particle physics at all
and i the only thing i can bring to the table is is a general interest in the particularly the framework
of what about periodicity from from the framework really for kind of purely mathematical study of
clifford algebras um but on this uh certainly very fundamental question of how one brings in some
notion of an emergent space-time structure uh which also i mean clearly goes to this criticism that has
been made by some of the people pushing back that at the moment you're as it were so far the program
has really only addressed the the algebraic structure of the standard model hasn't as it were gone into
issues about dynamics and you know clearly one would have to go into those issues about dynamics in any
um in any development which did bring in space-time algebras as for the space-time front loops
