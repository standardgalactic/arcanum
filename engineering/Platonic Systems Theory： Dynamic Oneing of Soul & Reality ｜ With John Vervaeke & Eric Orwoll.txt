he feeds our mind body and soul the intellect represented here cause and effect everything
begins with choice hey kierkegaard said every duty is essentially duty to god plato's symposium
this yours
wonderful i'm so happy to be back with both of you um and i i thought i would start
first whether we could just share something i've i don't know eric have you been watching much of
john's uh new series i know it's like a monumental task to keep up with this i have been keeping up
with it i have been keeping up with it yeah i'm loving it uh the discussions the recent discussions
on kierkegaard have been really interesting i love the stuff on irony um yeah it reminded me of a
my wife made at one point it was just the most profound thing i'd really ever heard in an
aphorism which was like why every moment in life has severity and flippancy and that's that
that irony that you're talking about i really love it yeah yeah yeah yeah cool well i i asked because
i wanted to follow some of the themes and just kind of we could all share some something that we
thought was kind of ironic or made us rethink how we were looking at the world and kind of like an
aporia it could be very small irony it doesn't have to be some kind of like systemic insight that
you're you're having um but just something like like that that that maybe you experienced and i
always go first so i'll go last this time just to kind of not leave the question as much so eric maybe
you want to share something yeah sure um i was sort of reflecting on our previous conversations
and for the first conversation um i didn't really know what to expect i had started the awakening from
the meaning crisis series and i didn't understand your work really so i kind of approached it with
this like relatively empty mind ready to be filled and then for the second uh discussion i you know had
binged a lot of your content and read your papers and realized the significance of what you're doing
and so i felt this like urgent need to offer you up something so i took the whole week off work
and oh no no i did leaning up to it and um but ultimately i think the first discussion uh got
closer to that real uh diologos so that's an irony and i guess maybe i shouldn't be taking weeks off
work to you know offer up some intellectual tidbit well i want to go back to not right now i mean i want
to go back and watch both again i i actually found the second one uh really good i thought it was very
provocative there was a lot of insight that i garnered from it so i really appreciated that
for me uh within my practices um the almost has been coming up almost this and almost that um
and i've often struggled against that and found it frustration frustrating the almost um
but in in some of the inner work i've been doing the inner dialogical work and other the almost is
perhaps optimal this is the irony that's coming out for me in that allows one to get close enough
it's kind of analogous to serious play allows one to get close enough to make perhaps some
influential moves and redirect things without getting too close that one gets consumed uh and
corrupted and uh so i thought uh there's been this reframing for me of the almost uh as something that
i shouldn't be seeing so negatively but i should be seeing as positively so there was there was a an
ironic realization for me there those were so awesome both examples i really just want to savor
them for a moment because uh yeah the that that insight you were saying too john i think is uh really
profound because because the the youngian aspirational model doesn't othering is really important right
because you don't actually have to make contact with things you just have to give them a space for
communications that's really cool that like that the humility uh that you were experiencing in that
or that that kind of moment and i've just been finding ai amazing that's kind of my my recent uh
metanoia and and appreciation and and kind of i've probably learned about dozens and dozens of ai
tools over the last week or so and it's just like this serious play that i was so playing with all these
different ai technologies that it started to kind of permeate how i was looking at the world and the
world opened up and i go wow all this wonder in this domain really kind of opened up into like wow
that's so cool that i'm living in this wild time that that you know that the tales are going to expand
so radically on what humans can do creativity creatively and it was just so cool to see the ai voices
getting better and how people are generating video from text and just all these things which is
i know it's a very technical kind of thing but but it was very playful and fun to to kind of see
um so so that was a good share um and then maybe we'll just do one more round of of uh just anything
that's been philosophically valuable to you in the last few weeks it's like oh cool we're three people
wondering about things uh again eric if you want to go first or if you don't want to that's totally
fine as well hmm well i'm trying to think is there any new philosophical insight um you know i'm always
obsessed with philosophical arguments um so i'm sure there's been a few that have run through my mind
i guess really it's mostly um this issue of relevance realization um and predictive processing
that i've been thinking about just in the last couple days and um i'm curious this is just turning
into a question i'd always have questions for john so um but that's what's in my mind so philosophically
speaking the question is you know i've heard john mention there are moments when we kind of let go
of that pursuit of relevance and that's almost like a more sublime experience and and yet then
in the predictive processing paper um you talk about like there's a kind of um you know like tai chi
between autism and schizophrenia that we have to balance and i love the the imagery there and just
imagining like that that balancing act that we're constantly going through and i wonder you know
and i don't know how to make sense of it you know how how does that jive this balance that we have to
strike with that kind of more sublime you know release from the process and is it also part of the balance
or is this like a meta balancing at on another axis so um what's what's the etiquette here should we
first continue around the circle and then come back let's let's follow eric i think that was he seems
really passionate and excited about this question so let's follow i think that i was just i was just
talking to brendan about this um yeah so first of all i want to be very careful about what that proposal
is um i don't think you misrepresented it at all eric i just want to unpack it um uh so that we might have
the the the best possible set of tools we're talking about sort of things at the threshold
of intelligibility so it's very tricky but it's very germane to the whole platonic neo-platonic
tradition and other traditions like zen um uh so first of all the proposal is that um
relevance realization and predictive so first of all let's just for people who are just listening the idea
is uh let's take the predictive processing framework carl friston andy clark and especially
a student that andy and i shared mark miller who's now working with me um who is both one of the best
people i know in my life and also titanically brilliant and he he is already superseding me
and i'm very proud of him and i hope that's not in a condescending way i genuinely i'm very proud
of mark um and then of course the work uh brett anderson is out there just uh follow him and
follow his sub stack he's just generating all this amazing stuff so here's the basic idea though um
in predictive processing uh there's two meta problems you're facing uh sorry not in predictive
processing being a cognitive agent you're facing two meta problems one is i want to anticipate the
world rather than react to it because if i can avoid the tiger that's much better than wrestling with
the tiger um and then the other one is well that problem i've been obsessed with relevance realization
um and then what we tried to show is it turns out that the if you put these two together they sort of
mutually solve each other and the predictive processing idea is um the the main there's the
main insight is don't try to predict the world try to predict yourself and as you get really better at
predicting yourself you end up predicting the world well so what does that mean you have the the sort of
sensory motor part of the brain are interacting with the world and they're generating all kinds
of patterns and then you have a layer above that right um that is trying to predictively complete
uh that pattern um and and it can get error feedback from the from the lower part of the brain
clear error feedback no that's wrong that's in a way the world doesn't give you clear error feedback
right and then you you stack these layers on top of each other and you get this massively
recursive process of predicting yourself at various levels of resolution from very sort of momentary
concrete to very abstract and then the idea is error is flowing up and uh imaginal prediction
is flowing down um and that's how you uh you get to really anticipate the world at many different
scales now the problem with predictive processing is there's an issue in there about what's called
precision weighting you you there's a lot of signal you want to just ignore because it's well irrelevant
it's task irrelevant etc um so what we propose is the following if you let predictive processing sort
of self-organize and you put in sort of a process by which it does precision weighting that's how it's
sort of paying attention what happens is the predictive processing starts to self-organize to find trade-off
relationships um in reality uh like between generalizing and discriminating between bias and
variance i won't go into all of them but it finds these trade-off relationships and it sort of
capitalizes on them uh by by giving opponent processing and then the opponent processing
starts to do the relevance realization and the predict in the precision weighting and so the whole
system starts to anticipate in a relevant realizing relevance realizing manner um and then does relevance
realizing in an anticipatory manner i just wanted to lay that out because if we just start talking
about i think a lot of people would go what the hell are they talking about uh first of all did that
just sort of land as a as a proposal uh um sorry as an exposition that's very helpful yes thank you
and and so and then of course once you get that you get some advantages because you can you get a
way to theoretically glue predictive processing into embodiment because relevance realization
is always relevance to autopoiesis and that helps you deal with a lot of criticisms of predictive
processing that it sort of floats free and it's kind of like a pan psychist pan semanticist weirdness
like two clocks that get entrained to each other like on a shelf would be cognitive under this
definition and um and so uh the the theories help each other the analogy i use is predictive
processing is like mendelian genetics and relevance realization is like darwinian selection and when
you put them together you get the grand synthesis um so that being said now to move to the more um
i think i'm going to use this word because it's right in this context the mystical proposal um this
actually came up when i was in in conversation with buddhist monks uh which was kind of interesting um
and i sort of had the realization in discussion it was a very much a deal deal like dialogical
realization i said well the relevance relevance realization is intrinsically interested in itself
because it's a self-correcting evolving thing and insight is the i think incontrovertible proof that we
relevance realization is recursively interested in itself in this way
um but one of the things it can realize is that the process of relevance realization itself can
ultimately be irrelevant um and then what that when why when might that be the case
and this is the idea that when you're not trying to be in relationship to beings but to the ground of
being itself um then you have to let go and then what you're doing is basically your your the the
principle the wanting within relevance realization and the wanting within reality then enter into
resonance with each other um um it's a proposal for trying to understand non-duality and what's going
on there um the problem that not the problem well maybe it's a problem i don't want to put words
into eric's mouth the thing is yes but predictive processing you're always doing this balancing
between overfitting and underfitting right yes and so here's what i'm going to say that's the
predictive processing side of the relevance realization side when i'm when i'm in resonance
with the ground of being itself the issue of overfitting or underfitting disappears
because there is no overfitting or underfitting that is to properly misrepresent the ground of
being right because there is the ground of being is no thing right uh it's a nothingness um and you
know and this is a um this doesn't necessarily even have to be a heideggerian reading uh you know this
is a zen reading there's lots of ways in which the neoplatonic one is understood this way and so the
balancing act which is an optimal grip in which you're trying to get the the environmentally
dependent because these decisions are always environmentally dependent um and so notice
that i'm trying to balance between overfitting and underfitting that's the main thing right
sorry some can you hear that somebody's cutting the lawn outside is not that bad okay okay so you're
trying to get the balance between overfitting and underfitting and you're optimally gripping but you
can't decide that a priori because it's what what is the best depends on the environment you're in
and this goes to a paper that anna riddell and i are trying to get published but when you're not in
any environment but in the encompassing ground of all possible environments that problem falls away
for you and that you're just you're right um you're not doing the balance anymore you are right you
there is no overfitting underfitting concern um and i take it that this is kind of what is meant
i don't i don't think this is a forced reading um but you know that the dao is behind the yin and the
yang and even the the balance between them it's it's actually the the encompassing behind them
kind of thing um so that would be my initial answer to you eric that's great yeah i was also
wondering in this balance whether it's desirable to employ a kind of barbelling strategy um nasim
taleb talking about like investing strategies says you really want to like minimize your downside and
maximize your upside and don't really worry about the intermediary states so you know that barbell shape
now if we have that underfitting and overfitting um you know schizophrenia and autism do we want to
barbell those two strategies so that we can kind of have the best of both worlds um and will that
allow for this um kind of subsiding into the background and the ground of cognition i would
imagine that it wouldn't but at the same time i would imagine that a barbelling strategy would have
like adaptive advantages yeah uh and so this goes towards a proposal and it's a theoretical proposal
that leo ferraro and i made when we published the first paper on uh mindfulness i've you know i followed
it up with a paper within rick repeti's uh philosophy of meditation and then there's one i've also submitted
for an anthology that uh brian ostefan is putting together uh and they sort of form a trilogy so i might
get confused in my reference uh so i'm asking for forgiveness around that because the three sort of
like in my mind um so but the idea is there is something like the barbelling strategy but it's it
but it's within a a dynamics of opponent processing um and so you get a meditative tradition in which you're
you're you're driving very damp you're driving right down right um and then right and and you're in
in in a very powerful sense you're becoming sort of super autistic right and then there's the
contemplative strategy in which you're driving out and you're you're you're you're you're becoming you
know uh super schizotypical right right um but you you have them acting as correction on each other
because you're constantly flowing between them and opponent processing the idea is and then this
is what the traditions speak to and this is also what i've found in practice is that when you practice
this alternating um opponent processing you have two things one thing is you sort of increase the
flexibility of this you increase the flexibility of your attentional scaling where the flexibility is
measured by what's the range you can go to how readily can you get out of an attractor state to
other states how long can you in like can you keep the alternation going things like this measures
of flexibility so it does that and that just i i i i claim it's like a prediction that um this
enhances just your day-to-day optimal gripping it sort of improves your meta-optimal gripping
but and and that's valuable for wisdom right but it also does this other thing which is when you do
this
you right first first you like you're doing like a prajna practice out you do you inhale and you go
as contemplatively out as you can and then you exhale you go as meditatively in and first you're just
doing this you're alternating and then you're starting to do them in parallel right and then what happens is
is it's all at once it's it's deep in and you get the non-duality the prajna uh which isn't which
isn't homogeneous it's the world in a grain of sand and every grain and goes into the world it's it's
that william blake kind of thing the scans intuitiva um and so i think the that combination of what you might
call every day uh improvement of optimal gripping and mystical access to the this this what we've just
been talking about where you let go is actually sort of meta optimal for us um in a very powerful way
because i think the ability to let go opens up a space in which the flexibility can stretch if you'll
allow me to play with that metaphor more without with and then the optimal gripping also um tends to
get you um it tends to enhance the relevance realization machinery because the idea is the
better the relevance realization machinery is enhanced the better it is at realizing when it itself is
irrelevant it's a kind of a platonic argument right did that sorry that was a long answer
yeah yeah i can't say i 100 percent followed everything in there but i definitely got the gist
of it so um i wish i could follow better but um now have you made the association between um this kind of
autistic and schizophrenic method and the monad and the indefinite dyad in pythagoreanism have you thought
about okay because i've i've heard others talk about autism as like an extreme masculine brain
structure and then it's getting around your extreme feminine and the monad is the principle
of the masculine and the indefinite diet is the principle of the feminine and of course the monad is
that limiting um kind of you know centrifugal and self-enclosed yes very much yes yes yeah right
yeah right so this kind of ties in also to what i've really been wanting to talk to you about
from uh our first conversation which is you know your conception of naturalism the naturalistic
imperative and cognitive science and an activism and i believe there's real value in that but also
you know relevance realization seems to be taking place downstream of the monad and the indefinite
dyad and for me i like it just i have an intuition that cognition must have its root
deeper than that in the one itself and any activity of cognition certainly will involve the
monad indefinite dyad any intelligibility anything that we're going to encounter here but the one
i feel like i i don't know how you include that in a naturalistic conception oh so excellent
excellent i just gave a talk about this at the conciliance conference about this and about uh
how how we how how can we have strong transcendence which is transcendence that's that's not just
psychological improvement but has real epistemic and ontological import um and therefore would
ground the spirituality the way neoplatonism grounds the spirituality and how could you do that within a
naturalistic like what would it be and one of the main arguments i made and i've been developing but i
made it um i made it at ralston but i made it better i think at least the feedback seems to agree with me
at uh the conciliance uh talk is that i talk about extended naturalism and i talk about um the idea that
naturalism is not only that which is uh inferentially derivable from our sciences but that which is uh
presupposed by our sciences and then then that gets you so i call this extended naturalism and then
when you talk about that um uh and then you you you get a real um leveled ontology real emergence real
emanation and i argued for that and then a real conformity kind of knowing and i argued for that
you put those together and you get strong transcendence within extended naturalism so i i think very i
think you're right i don't have any i agree with you and i've been trying to get the idea so i mean i
still teach the naturalistic imperative in cognitive science to uh introductory cog sci because people are
being ushered into a scientific world view um and that's proper but i think any account of cognition
has to go has to rely on an extended naturalism in the way i've just articulated like we have to get
we have to get an account of um intelligibility and uh the the interpenetration of intelligibility and
being you know that hegel is wrestling with and plato is wrestling with etc yes into any deep account
i think of uh of human cognition so yeah i think i hope you take it my answer is yes i totally agree
with that uh and that we've got to unfold that um i i and um i don't phrase it quite the way you do but
i'm very interested in because i was talking to brendan about this about what do we do when we're and
you can see physics bumping into an analogous problem right with ideas of the singularity is like
how do we get something that is simultaneously the source of unity and difference and yet it is bound
in some original uh you know all the words are wrong simplicity some original one um yeah yeah totally
yeah yes and i'm trying to respond to it and that's how i'm trying to respond to it
okay that that also relates to something i heard you talking about with regard to like the i guess
extended nature of of cognition and mind and i forget honestly exactly which conversation this was it
might have been with rick repeti um but it was uh this notion that there isn't a monadic self that like
yes fundamentally there is this interplay like just you can't eliminate that multiplicity and i think
that you can't eliminate the multiplicity but also at the same time i feel like for for some basic kind
of philosophical reasons you do need the monad in the self at some level like for for leibnitz you know
what what distinguishes us from mechanism what distinguishes us from like component parts interacting
is that i mean there is this kind of integral unity and that's why he feels the need to put forward
you know our being a monad and reflecting the other being so there is an implicit and inherent
multiplicity in us but without that oneness um i've found it difficult to imagine how you know like with
leibnitz's mill the thought experiment you walk into the mill uh which is supposed to be like a
a conscious agent and you see the parts interacting like okay where's the oneness that i experience in
myself in this you know so i feel i feel that the the self has to be grounded at some level in a henad
you know a unity of some kind call it a monad or not do you um was i getting you wrong before when you
said that there's like no monadic aspect to the self or it's just not a pure monad
so i mean i think of the self um and the mind so there's life mind self and i think of them as
deep continuity and i think of life as auto poetic um and it is a unity but as it is a unity that in
which you get this weird thing that there is the generation of norms or standard to which the organism
then binds itself so there is right there is a going out and a returning back there's a there's
an aspect of self-transcendence that's built into life at its fundamental that is not a contradiction
to the fact that it is an auto in fact it is integral to it being an auto poetic thing because
you have to be you know it has to be a dialogical thing in some sense in order for it to be auto poetic
and so i think of the self that way too i think the self is a self-making thing in fact the reason
why i i i want to emphasize and rick and i are working on a paper about this um the auto poetic
dialogical nature of the self is precisely in over to in order to be able to overcome um the paradox of
self-transcendence as posed by strawson i mean a monadic self can't self-transcend it doesn't make any
sense uh so if it just if it if it just extends itself that's not self-transcendence because it
doesn't have the requisite otherness um if something other than it breaks in that's not
it's transcendence but it's not self-transcendence and then strawson argues therefore self-transcendence
self-creation are impossible and this feels like kant's argument that there can never be a science of
biology it's like yeah but life is exactly that kind of thing um galen strawson and so your model
the presupposition under it namely that there's something ultimately monadic about the self is the
one that we have to give up so that would be my response what about a leibnizian monad that is
itself extended in the sense that everything that we interact with all of our relationships
through you know the analyticity of identity or rather analyticity of predication for leibniz
all of those relationships are in us essentially they are part and parcel of that monad so because
it contains that multiplicity you can kind of transcend the current state of that self by adjusting the
levels you know of of the relations that you're partaking of and the the intensity that they have for
you at that moment so it sounds to me like all you're doing then is stretching out the dialogical
between one instance of the self and another instance of it and then it's no longer self-enclosed
it's self-transcending in a very powerful way because what you invoked was right because if it's just
static like the the the uh what they see everything but they have no windows who i forget who said that
about leibniz's monads right um then the the problem is you get an absolutely static thing which of course
can't be what affords self-transcendence and what you introduce then is you introduce a historical
dimension and then you're making it temporally non-monadic in order to get the self-transcendence in
right it's like the neoplatonic saying like everything is in everything but appropriately in each
and so the self-transcendence wouldn't be fundamentally swapping out any stuff you would
just be kind of adjusting and attuning the levels of awareness of you know what's involved but that
monad is a kind of necessarily fixed thing because it's that which allows these multiple relations to
come into um their interaction i mean maybe i mean to me that would be sort of equating the self to
sort of the normative structures that bind the self together and i think that's a necessary but
insufficient account of the self i think the self has to be able to i think the self is an entity
and this is kirkegaard right the self is an entity that is properly always in relationship to itself
um and that and so i want to be able to i'm trying to say to you that i think the principle of
differentiation is just as important to a self as the principle of integration um and then a self is a
self-complexifying thing and and of course complexification is how you can explain emergence
and transcendence and for me again i think that's a much more dialogical model than a monotic model
okay and i get that but it you know i've heard you say before that the emanation and the emergence have
to completely in interpenetrate and be like on a par with one another um like following erigena and
you know i don't know how i feel about that ultimately because i do get this sense and you know
you know when i read proclis he reinforces these ideas that the monad does have a kind of preeminence
over the indefinite dyad and in the one there is one and many as um damascus says you know it's not
simply a one and yet there is the preeminence of the one that's why we call it one right um so
yes i think the self has to be um inherently dialogical just like in some sense the one itself
has to be dialogical but i don't know if you can put the oneness on a par with the multiplicity i feel
like there is a kind of logical priority to unity i mean just with numbers like in order to reach
multiplicity first you have to get through unity and unity like see the whole point is implied a lot of
the recent you know this is where i think derida is strong in the post-modernists is to emphasize
how much difference is also irremovably essential to intelligibility and so if the one is the source
of intelligibility and not just the source of sort of mathematical unity um the one has to be equally
the source of uh integration and differentiation uh if it's the source of intelligibility because if i
remove all difference i lose information for example i lose all information and i just get homogeneous
non-intelligibility um and that i don't think that's what they want to talk about um i i don't
know what i'm not quite sure what the preeminence what your intuition of preeminence is and i'm not
i'm not trying to bully you at all i'm right i like i like i i see the oneness in the quantum realm and
the oneness from the oneness from the bottom the ground and the oneness of the canopy from of of
of you know uh at the cosmological level uh as um deeply uh deeply one i mean and that's what's
driving the current physics there's the deep intuition that these two right the oneness of
entanglement and the oneness uh of space-time somehow belong together um and i think that's right and i think
trying to prioritize one over the other because what the physicists are doing is they have exactly
the opposite intuition of you they say no no no the bottom right the bottom is the real and and it
should be given preeminence in our explanation and so i like when i look at these two two sets of it uh
and i mean this in a positive sense on a dismissive sense when i look at these two sets of philosophical
intuitions they seem exactly symmetrical to me and i can't come up with an argument for why
one is better than the other because whatever you say about this i just invert it and say this
this is the other one has the complementary strength so i i do this elsewhere at greater length so
i'm just running through quickly i have this symmetry argument exactly like between these two
and and i think the reason why i'm not a physicist but i do study problem solving and they're not solving
this problem and they haven't been solving it for 50 years and so when you're not solving a problem
you need to step back and look at a presupposition that you're not changing across all your theorizing
and one of the presuppositions is the fundamentality of the bottom and i think that's what's actually
thwarting them they need a properly uh symmetrical solution to how to bring about the integration that's
my response now that i agree with you that that's not that's not in proclis it's certainly not in
platinus i would make a case that i think it's properly in erigena and i think it's because erigena
has a trinitarian notion behind him that he can sort of get them uh being uh of equal ontological status
right the preeminence for me comes from the idea that there is a procession outward into multiplicity
and yes the one is equally the cause of the multiplicity but as you're moving away from the
one you're moving away from the good and so teleologically the return the reversion back to the
one is to be preferred is to be kind of held up as superior in some sense than the descent into
multiplicity um similar to how in the theatetus uh plato says that god is the cause of all good
things right not necessarily all things because so much of our experience here deals with falsehood
and illusion which we talked about last time and i really liked what you had to say last time about
that um but yeah it's like there's something about this lower realm uh closer to the bottom
that has a lesser degree of reality and that's why like platinus and proclis both um treat matter
as in some sense preparatory platinus treats it more as an archaic of uh or principle of evil you know
following like the way that socrates is talking in the phaedo um and i think that's a mistake and he's
taking socrates a little bit too seriously you can never take socrates too seriously it's
danger of hermeneutics there um but proclis you know says that there is no rk strictly speaking with
regard to matter or evil it is this kind of pure privation and i feel like there's a need for that
concept in order to make sense of falsehood and make sense of apparent evil and make sense of
all the incongruity and lack of oneness that we observe and so for me that and i think for the
neoplatonists that is on the bottom of the ontological hierarchy so there is this real
difference you know there's an asymmetry between the bottom of the top there's an emanation out to
this receptacle um matter and then there's the reversion back to the source and the sources to be
preferred okay so i'll reply to that um and first of all i think for er like erigena that the four
ways in which god is god god is also not just the top he's also the bottom um he's the nothingness
the no thingness that makes everything uh uh possible um and i think what you see in erigena and
this is one of the things that um i see the kyota school criticizing neoplatonism for is you get uh
the idea that what we have to hold actuality and possibility as equally real um and so i can do the
exact reverse i can say so the zen tradition will come to you and say what's most real is the suchness
the absolute unique you know specification suchness of this and how it all fits into
everything else that's you know you're losing touch with what is most real because you've lost touch
uh with it and what's underneath the suchness is the luminous void is the pure uh is is a kind
of pure potentiality which is very similar to you know certain ways in which people understand the
quantum uh domain and so now and now what do we do we and you and i want to say because if i lose that
you know i lose also something that i find supremely valuable which is the suchness of and it's also
ineffable it's also non-categorical right and and that i mean the suchness really matters that solaris
brought that out right right the solaris paradox here's individual you know do you know the story
right you're on the the you're on the planet that's the stanislav lamb is one of the great
uh philosophical sci-fi and and the idea is the ocean they and people are trying to communicate with
the ocean and they can't they can tell it's intelligent but they can't so they send it they
send these people here to actually live like and the ocean generates absolute doppelgangers of people
they used to know more like absolute so the paradox is these people so let's take our hero there's
here's this woman he was deeply in love with he's lost the woman to death the ocean generates somebody
that has all the properties right all of the categorical properties of the woman shouldn't
he love her well no he has exactly the opposite he is horrified by this right so and he feels part of
himself being drawn to her because she is identical but he's also repulsed because it doesn't have
that suchness of that particular person that historical irreplaceable in time and space suchness
and that matters to us too and that's enough that that is equally a touchstone of realness for us
i mean what i'm ultimately trying to do and this is what the next series is about is i want to put zen
which is the great synthesis of the east buddhism and daoism and neoplatonism the great synthesis of
the west into a deep dialogical relationship with each other that's what the new series is about
because they they often have these inverted complementary senses of what's real and what's good
um and um and we we have reason to believe that this is a dual project the kyoto schools of course had a
lot of good to say about this thomas plant is doing it in his book you know where he's trying to put
uh dionysian neoplatonism into discussion with buddhism um and so that's my that's my answer
uh again i'll just keep going back that i can make moves where i can say yes this gives you that uh but
this also gives you right the opposite way and you also think of that as a touchstone of real uh so
there's there's something and and you know object-oriented ontology has really been wrestling
with this too it's like and they talk about you don't want to undermine and you don't want to
overmine uh right and and and and trying to get that balance and i think the way we can do that is we
can i think neoplatonism tends to overmine when it goes wrong and i think zen tends to undermine
when it gets wrong it tends to lose the reality of the systems and the gestalts right and if we
could put them into a deep dialogue i think we could actually optimally grip between the two
and i think that's the best way of getting at uh the real and i think there's something right about
i think it's nishatani and religion and nothingness who says we need a position in which
uh actuality and possibility are equally real for us if we're going to break out a lot of these
straitjackets i just want to interrupt series 10 seconds uh yeah i i think like what you're saying
is really clever john i used to think you were kind of insane because i would meet every week
i would meet every week with like daniel zaruba and all these brilliant kind of platonists and also
they have like a really strong meditative practice and i'm seeing like all of this contemplative beauty
of platonism and then i've done a decent bit of zen practice and i kind of get what you were talking
about when you would talk about like the zen aspect and like zen is so invested in the spontaneity of like
kind of the material and and the neoplatonic is in like the integration of the conceptual or some or
like the imaginal or something like that yeah and and i was like this guy john verbeke like he's very
smart but this is something he's probably wrong at and i kept sticking with it because you say it and
now you say it even more but i mean even like you know eight months ago you were you were saying it a
little bit and it's like oh yeah i kind of get because they're like these two engines they're these two
awesome kind of traditions that are these engines and when you put them together they're so powerful
they they they they do for you participatorially uh so much and like tanabe eric if you're interested
in he you can just get his book on metanoetics and just search like platinus or plato and he says some
really insightful things about platinus because i love platinus like blindly love platinus and then
i'm like oh cool tanabe is giving some criticism that has a lot of merit it's like oh okay let me think
about that and kind of have a a dialectic with tanabe's view of platinus versus kind of platinus's
view of platinus and you you learn so much and it's like there's there's this richness between the
traditions the same way kind of the kyoto school was was bridging all of this with western europe
the you know they're also bridging with the ancient uh kind of roman greco tradition yeah they
are it's so exciting like once you kind of can see it that way it's like oh that's what john is
so excited about and and always talking about because they do they're such opposite poles
in really seemingly contrasting ways but they do have a synergy yeah and uh they like like a like a
that heterogeneity of their system is like what makes it kind of cool when you start to yeah i'm
proposing that right from get-go we try and bring about something that has opponent processing written
into its fundamental grammar rather than something that sort of finds as it unfolds yeah and when you
have to remember that like you know there's there's there's been a long-standing tradition of zen
christianity and zen catholicism that's also been and when you look what they're trying to merge with
in the christianity and the catholicism are the are the neoplatonic elements um and so like i i this is not
completely de novo and and plant is doing it in his book and he he makes arguments that it it was
probably already how it was happening you know uh on the silk road um in the past um yeah so yes
i'm excited about it too and i eric i realize this is somewhat promissory uh but that is the that is
the project i'm i'm working on and that's the argument i i use to justify the project well yeah i think
i might be able to kind of reconcile the neoplatonic account with some closer to what you're talking
about so the concept of matter obviously it only has kind of an apparent existence for proclus it is
preparatory now uh platinus in on the nature of matter uh i forget i think it's second enneid uh
eighth track date maybe no uh i forget which one but uh he talks about the intelligible matter
which is contrasted with the the kind of imminent physical matter in that the imminent physical
matter is a principle of individuation and it's what separates things and different forms can occupy
that matter and that kind of separates them in space but the intelligible matter is actually a factor
of uh uniting for the forms because that matter uh being closer to this divine source of the
indefinite dyad contains all of that multiplicity in a unity as is the case with everything in the realm
of forms that everything is much more concentrated there now i have my own kind of i have i'll credit
myself with one original philosophical insight that i haven't heard from anyone else which is kind
of a corollary to leibnitz's indiscernible ability um or rather identity of indiscernibles and it's
the um indeterminateness of indifference that's the corollary to it so for leibnitz if things share
exactly the same properties they are one in the same thing it's kind of like plato seems to say the
same thing as well i think of leibnitz as like very much a neoplatonist um but uh yeah the the flip
side of that is that if there's something in our experience related to our identity within our monad
in leibnitz's sense that is indistinguishable from other possible substrates um like matter doesn't have
definite formal content and leibnitz uh actually disagrees with me in the point that i'm about to
try to articulate for you um in that he says you know in the monadology if you keep zooming in to
matter there's just more form there's just you're going to find planets and trees and rivers and like
there's no end to it and i think that's that may be right but not in the way that leibnitz thought in
because i use this indefiniteness of indiscernibles concept where if from my perspective given the
information i have access to i could not discern between the world in which like an atom in my
finger had a planet uh with like aquatic environments or a planet that was a big desert you know tatooine
world that's uh i can't make a difference between that and so it doesn't exist uh relative to me in
either of those definite states and i think we have to say that if we accept what's going on in
information theory and physics where we have an information mass energy correspondence because if
we want to go with leibnitz and say that things are fully specified down to like an infinite degree
of smallness then that's infinite information that's infinite specificity ergo infinite energy
mass which clearly is not the case so i think that argument's the correct argument yes
keep going yeah so uh i've i've tried to interpret the neoplatonic notion of mundane
matter in that perspective it is a receptacle it is in a way apparent but it it the way that it appears
as a kind of pure potential masks like all of the reality that is really there in it so just like
the intelligible matter contains all possibility mundane matter may actually contain not one specific
configuration of really small worlds down there but a kind of superposition of all the various
configurations and structures we might find um so that has a lot of implications um that i've explored over
the years but it does kind of divinize matter in a way not matter in its appearance which as its appearance
is uh not quite a principle of evil but it is that kind of a principle of separation that allows for
misconception that allows for misapprehension falsehood and so like but it's not the you know what
is really there is that cloud of potential that contains all things you know all is in all and i
think that applies even at that fundamental physical level however i would say with the neoplatonists that
the physical is suspended from the mental and that's where we i think must disagree you know relative
to your naturalism and so maybe we could explore something like that more next time um this also ties back
into one argument that i um briefly kind of uh intimated at in our first discussion about the
immortality of the soul so i've used this argument of the um indefiniteness of indiscernibles
to in combination with iit and tegmark's mathematical multiverse because i i am a mathematical
realist i think we need the mathematicals out there yes yes i agree with that of course yes and i think
that implies in many worlds so the the upshot of it though is that we you know as we experience a
death we are one finite you know semi-mathematical system in an infinite sea of possibility and the
matter there is it contains all of the possible transformations that may occur not in space and
time sequentially exclusively but what are the intelligible structures that can move through
a seek like a principle of sufficient reason abiding sequence you know like iit talks about the causal
repertoire but their concept of causality is just like the association of states and these are
eidetic structures and these are mathematical structures and so that's kind of where i situate
the the soul and like our the core of our life and i would say that's prior to space-time and then we'd
have to get into like the the question that we got at almost at the end of the last conversation about
there's so much that i'd love to talk to you about i'd like to like drive up to toronto and talk to you
for five hours that i could but um yeah this idea we just began to scratch the surface of which is like the
emergence of body and the role of measurement and the role of consciousness in that and uh so that's kind of
how i i i view it the mathematicals are eternal and real therefore the soul is real because the
soul is of the nature of the mathematicals like iamblichus says in on the general science of
mathematics so we are this kind of eternal eidetic structure we are akin to the forms in that way
and we give rise to body in our energizing not us directly because we're also tied to the world
soul and i think that has a real psychic uh substance just like we do um so there has to be a
correspondence between us and the world soul it's not like pure solipsism where like the physical
world is my projection it's our mutual projection led by like the great um mother so
i want that five words john i want this summarized and answered in about you know maybe eight words
we'll give you a couple extra words no well first of all i mean i appreciated the you know the
uh the reinterpretation of matter and kind of the the divinization of matter um i mean this we're
wrestling with stuff that was at the end of the middle ages right when and this the problem of
individuation was exactly the problem that sort of brought down neoplatonism and ushered in nominalism
um because you individuation and i mean spinoza makes this point and hegel needs this makes this
point and this is what i didn't quite hear in the proposal uh individuation needs this capacity
which we then regarded as the actuality of matter which is resistance uh to individuate is i i have
to be able to resist right uh right uh i have to be able to hold things out out of the out of the time
and space i'll put those in quotes because they're precisely what's in question but out of the time in
the space that i'm in you know and spinoza has the notion of kinatus and and i and that's what became the
primary right and right matter was resistance and and the resistance is what allows for the
individuation and and so for me um i think there's truth in that i think that uh matter isn't purely
privative it has if it is the principle of individual i agree with what happened i just disagree
with the what the nominalists concluded about this i think we had to if we're going to have a principle
of individuation it has to have what you know hegel talked about is you know negative determination
it has to have the that fundamental ability to resist to hold things out from it uh uh so
because if everything interbleeds you don't get into and interpret you don't get individuation anymore
you get interpenetration and of course and this is this was a problem as you know for you know
neoplatonism is how are the forms different from each other in the intellect because they completely
mirror and interpenetrate each other um and and so i think i agree with a lot of what you're saying
uh i think uh we'd have to talk about it more and so um i'm happy for you to go over what you
you said again especially the matter part but i do think there's something right to the idea that matter
is um as that kind of super positioning of potentiality like you described i think that's
right and i think that reaches into the quantum in really cool ways i like that but i do think matter
also has right it has an actuality of resistance that is what is required for it to be able to
perform individuation um and i think that's an important thing too and i think that is a proper
part of right um trying to explain like emergence upward um in an important way um uh now does that
necessarily reify matter then and would you then need to have a form of matter to specify what it
is that has this resisting potential because i i would feel comfortable just placing that resistance
in the very most basic formal property that can occupy that potentiality right and there's even a notion
like this that kind of sounds like quantum foam again in the theatetus where uh they talk about like
before you have definite body you have kind of like a pulling apart swirling like capacity for form
that's more than pure uh privation it's not nothing but it's not quite you know a particular body yet
so but then that's yeah above like matter itself i would say that resistance could very well have to
do with that very like uh vague and ambiguous and mysterious notion from the theatetus that there is
some kind of intermediary between body and and matter just pure potential well even even the
notion of the quora the receptacle uh implies resistance right things can't be like if if if
if you like if i want to receive if i want to be a receptacle for something i have to be it has to be
able to be held by me if we're if the notion is going to have any sort of meaning which means if it could
if it if if there's no resistance or there's no receptacle um so what about the way that the one
contains all things but that's precisely the point which goes back to your point before the the the one
contains all things in an in a way in which they do not have any individuation whatsoever that's what
makes it the one right um and and that and that and that's the problem with the forums right it's like
well the forums are how are they different for like and what people like and platinus uses staple
he uses spatial metaphors oh it's different like no no that doesn't work right um you you because you
you know you can you can say like think about all the forms i could do some compression function on
them so that i got the one form or something like that and then there isn't there isn't a fundamental
principle of individuation hmm i would think of the difference of the forms just throw this out there
as like the difference between colors or the difference between different timbres in musical
tones where it's like different uh spectral analysis that you could draw of it each contains all
the you know frequency ranges but in different proportions um but yeah i know you're out of time
and we could keep going but um yeah because i uh they all they're also different in what is waving
in the waves right um there's electromagnetism versus sound and air and so that's part of it too
and then then i would bring in the resistance and matter is what allows waves to exist and so yeah
but we could do this we could keep going back and forth um i i and um i want to do that so i'm not
trying to uh jump ship uh but i do have to actually go we're at my absolute uh limit um eric this this is i
think we uh we got the best of both the first and the second uh discussions into this and we got into
genuine dialogos in a really good way yeah we i think we were really sparking off of each other
so i wanted to thank you for that yeah just like the other times leaves me wanting more and i am
willing to drive up to toronto if you want to talk for five hours anytime let me know well we can i'll
probably take you up on that when i can block off five hours for people other than my romantic partner
and my kids uh and my friends i'm spread very thin right now um and and i have people like robert
who are trying to alleviate that and so hopefully there will be some more flexibility in my schedule
uh i would love to do that it would be great if the three of us could all get together in fact in
person i'd like that a lot yeah that'd be awesome you're very generous with your time appreciate
it john eric you know and and and this is not meant to be in any way condescending like it's
you're worth it like you're you're sharp and you're quick in the good sense and and and and you
have like you have both a comprehensive and a sophisticated grasp of this material and it's good
i mean you and i are ultimately from the same side of the tracks with with respect to most of the
culture and so i find working with you really really valuable i introduced eric to rick and rick was
like the same thing he was like oh you must be a professor somewhere because of your grasp on all
of this technical knowledge your capacity to deploy it in really interesting meaningful ways in these
kind of couldn't be higher level conversations yeah so i love bringing the two of you together as
well and i like i even in this hour i don't think i was like just noticing the joy of listening to the
whole thing and i was like oh this is delightful if i just listen more i'm gonna be happier like i'm
gonna experience more joy as i listen and and i think you're just confirming that john and what
you're saying and how you're complimenting eric which i think it's equally sincere yeah i i enjoy
uh eric's wit and warmth and intelligence so much and uh yeah thank both of you i've got to jump so
thank you very much and we'll talk again uh plato aristotle socrates can you consider yourself a
disciple of plato he feeds our mind body and soul
