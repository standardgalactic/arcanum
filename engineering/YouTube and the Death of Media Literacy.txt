what is media literacy um big tough question uh right out of the gate that's a really big question
uh gosh oh god wow that's not an intimidating question at all it's big eh it's big i've wanted
to make this video for a long time because there seems to be a general sense that people on the
internet have terrible media literacy it's like no one knows how to critically watch movies anymore
and everyone is falling for fake news or thinking ai generated images are real especially in the video
essay space i think a lot of frustration and drama and misunderstandings come down to poor media
literacy and i've seen my fair share of that as a content creator but then i had an idea if i could
make the perfect media literacy video essay teaching people how to engage more critically
and open-mindedly with the stuff they consume maybe i could fix youtube so with this extremely
achievable goal in mind i got to work given my background as an ex-english teacher who taught
media literacy skills in my classes i honestly thought that it would be relatively easy to make
a video about this stuff but as i started digging into things i quickly learned it's so much more
complicated than that i was completely unprepared for how difficult this video would be so today i
want to bring you along with me on this journey i'll talk about why media literacy is so complicated
what people get wrong about it and what we can do to fix it it's gonna be a big one there's gonna
be some twists and turns so if you're ready let's get into it when i decided to make a video about
media literacy the first thing i needed to do was to understand what media literacy even means and
this is harder than it sounds because while we talk about media literacy a lot people rarely stop to
actually define it in tweets and articles and even video essays people use the term to mean
kind of anything it's sort of become a catch-all for literary analysis critical thinking
fact-checking reading comprehension or just having the right opinion on a piece of media so my first
step was to establish what media literacy actually is and to do that i turned to academic articles and
textbooks because when in doubt find experts and listen to them but the thing is the experts don't
really seem to know what media literacy is either i had such high hopes i found all these great articles
i even got a couple of textbooks that are aimed at teachers and students i mean this book is for
middle schoolers how could it not be straightforward but to be honest i hated these articles and textbooks
i mean they're not that bad it's just it's hard to explain how academic resources can both say
so much and nothing at all at the same time like listen to this media literacy is the ability to apply
critical thinking skills to the messages signs and symbols transmitted through mass media or we define
media literacy as the ability to decode media messages including the systems in which they exist
assess the influence of those messages on thoughts feelings and behaviors and create media thoughtfully
and conscientiously or critical media literacy is about asking questions through cml we not only explore
what we know but also ask how we know it when practicing cml we employ a collection of skills that
help us move from being passive consumers of media to becoming engaged critics and creators
what does that mean like i know what all those words mean and i understand what those definitions are
getting at but like what is critical thinking here and what does it mean to decode the system in which
something exists and where do you even start with employing a collection of skills a lot of
organizations use some variation of the definition from the national association of media literacy
education which says that media literacy is the ability to access analyze evaluate create and act
using all forms of communication now this is vague as hell but in other places on the n-a-m-l-e site
they give a little more detail saying that media literacy is the ability to encode and decode the
symbols transmitted via media and synthesize analyze and produce mediated messages i understand that media
literacy is a complex topic but it seemed like every single definition i found was not only super vague and
abstract but also different from every other definition and that's only accounting for people who actually
gave definitions some of the sources i read didn't stop to define the term they just assumed that the
reader would be on the same page about what media literacy meant which is a bold strategy when you're
writing about such a complicated concept that doesn't seem to have any agreed upon definition so why
does all this research suck so bad at defining media literacy well the good news is that other researchers
are asking this same question there's one article i read analysis of definitions of media literacy
which what a great title and in this article the author w james potter did a meta-analysis of other
media literacy articles to figure out whether there's any widely agreed upon definition of the term
and what potter found was that there are 434 different elements associated with media literacy across the
hundreds of articles he read over 400 different skills or goals or outcomes that we associate with
media literacy to quote potter media literacy is regarded as being a conglomeration of a great many
skills including the ability to read evaluate analyze imagine possibilities deconstruct messages
recognize patterns challenge meanings judge credibility decipher sender intent counter argue dig for truth
avoid influence and produce messages and scholars claim that media literacy has the power to help us
improve a wide range of other skills and abilities it can also protect us from false messages in the media
create positive habits from scratch and transform risky behaviors into positive actions
it can alter faulty beliefs about self identity health community religion and media bias
while protecting our existing beliefs that are not faulty in some way
it can increase our degree of engagement with the media other people institutions and society at large
so yeah media literacy is complicated and what's even worse about all this is that when you can't
even agree on what something means it's impossible to agree on the scope of the problems with that thing
or how to solve those problems so not only was i running into these frustratingly vague definitions
but all the solutions that writers posed for how to teach better media literacy were also frustratingly vague
so many of the sources i looked at boiled down to teach students how to recognize fake news or talk to
your kids about social media algorithms for instance on the n-a-m-l-e website i that's such a difficult
like series of letters to say i'm not gonna just kind of gonna call it namel though that's pretty good
namely namely namely namely's not bad for instance on the n-a-m-l-e website they suggest integrating
real-world examples of media into lessons providing opportunities for hands-on learning and teaching
students about responsible online behavior and information literacy and on the one hand yeah that's
all great but when i was training to be a teacher we were constantly told about the value of relating
topics to students lives using real life examples as much as possible making lessons hands-on and
helping kids learn how to responsibly use the internet and that was almost a decade ago to me
all of these solutions from the n-a-m-l-e felt both glaringly obvious like yeah we should teach media
literacy skills in school but also unsatisfying i refuse to believe that the way to fix people's poor
media literacy is just pay more attention in english class so the scholarly research had provided more
problems than solutions and at this point i felt like i had wasted three weeks of my life getting
nowhere on this project so i did what we all do when we've reached rock bottom i went to twitter
part of this was because the scholarly stuff hadn't gotten me anywhere but it was also because i was
curious about another angle of this media literacy discussion whenever i had read about media
literacy in an academic context it was almost always focused on teaching students how to analyze
non-fiction students were media literate when they could identify fake news or tell the difference
between a news article and an advertisement but colloquially when most people use the term on the
internet it was more often applied to fiction people are media literate when they can analyze tv
shows or understand the themes of a movie the difference between how academics and lay people
use the term media literacy wasn't intended to be one of the main focuses of this video it was just
something that i was mildly curious about but especially after having learned that even media
literacy researchers can use the term wildly different from one another i was interested in how
this would be reflected in how the general public used the term but probably unsurprisingly twitter
didn't make anything clearer when you search media literacy you mostly just get people quote tweeting
someone's opinion on a tv show and saying media literacy is dead believe it or not there aren't
in-depth socratic dialogues happening on this godforsaken website but there was something that
surprised me during my twitter excursion apparently talking about media literacy
is cringe now maybe i'm too english teacher-pilled to understand this but i find it genuinely weird
that's like saying you think critical thinking is bad actually right according to twitter people who
care about media literacy are dweeby little nerds who don't want anyone to have any fun and they just
police people's interpretations of media media literacy enjoyers are pretentious woke scolds who want to
overanalyze everything when in reality it's not that deep bro so yet again i had run into yet another
hurdle that made this topic even more complicated than it was at the start and i felt like the more
i read about media literacy the more i realized just how complicated it is the more resentful i got about
it the past couple of weeks had been really difficult i'd had this video idea that i thought would be
if not simple at least straightforward but then i started to look into it and i found that no one
could agree on what the term media literacy even meant let alone agree on how we could fix things
and even when people offered solutions they were unsatisfying honestly it's no wonder there's
backlash against the very concept of media literacy no wonder everyone thinks it's cringe
it's a nebulous concept at best with a squishy ever-changing definition and because it has so
many other concepts packed into it it's nigh impossible to pin down and thus also impossible
to teach so whenever people talk about it any solution they offer is so basic it feels obvious and
audiences end up feeling condescended to it's messy it's complicated it's frustrating
and it's still something i wanted to make a video about but clearly my usual method of research
wasn't getting me anywhere so i did what all great academics do when they're frustrated out of their
minds about what they're studying i made it everyone else's problem too i hit up 12 of my friends and
asked them to sit down and chat with me about media literacy and honestly they added a lot more
complications but their insights did help me to work through the absolute mess that is media literacy
so let's see what they had to say hi you may not know me but my name is babilla i'm a uh video
essayist and friend of zoe most importantly my name is ben i run the youtube channel dummy i'm elliot
i um a youtuber hi my name is emily otherwise known as lady emily on the internet from the youtube
channel lady emily and is also co-writer for the channel sarah zed my name is jose i run a channel
that is also named jose well i'm legal kimchi i am a video essayist here on youtube i am lily
alaxander i make video essays about art and gender and the tech industry hello i'm lola sebastian i have
a youtube channel where i talk about primarily literary adaptations my name is nick covington i'm the current
creative director at human restoration project i'm no samson i make youtube videos i do commentary
videos yeah my name is scott nicewander i have a youtube channel called nerdsync my name is star i'm
an anime girl on the internet i am a comic artist and youtuber i've been making comics and stories on
the internet for basically as long as the internet has allowed you to do such a thing the first thing i
wanted to do with these interviews was to see if i could crowdsource a definition of media literacy
and when i asked everyone how they defined media literacy i got a really interesting variety of
answers mostly having to do with looking under the surface of a piece of media getting something more
than just the basic plot whether or not that deeper meaning was intended by the author media literacy it
comes in a lot of different shapes and forms right so when i think of someone who's media literate
it's someone who's engaging with a piece of media at a level that goes beyond passively consuming it
they're actively thinking about what they're seeing what it means and often placing it in a greater
context media literacy is understanding what the what the message what the point of something or at least
at the very least trying to uncover that and not necessarily taking everything as face value i suppose
so i think media literacy in general is your ability to properly like read into those things like to be
able to see like what somebody is trying to communicate whether it be intentional or not intentional
media literacy is the ability to apply like a variety of different ways of viewing media
the ability to understand a thing on its own terms and consider like the context that it was made in
all of these answers were so great i was genuinely so impressed by every single person i talked to
but there were some particularly interesting tidbits that i want to look at so remember some of the
definitions for media literacy folks i brought up earlier one of the things that almost all of them
included was the idea that media literacy isn't just about how we consume media but also the skills we
employ when creating it but even though all the people i interviewed are content creators only two
of them considered that creation element in their definitions nick who's a teacher and ben who studied
media literacy and works in media but i think media literacy today looks like being a critical consumer
of media considering purposes intentions but then also in the creation space too so i'm creating media
and information for authentic audiences i would say that media literacy expanding on that is something like
the ability to find and understand and maybe even create media in order to participate in society
i found it fascinating that everyone else focused on media literacy skills from the viewer side of things
rather than the creator side of things but honestly i think most of us think of it this way too right
media literacy is something you do when you're consuming media it's a skill for readers writing skills
are something totally different right i'll get into that in more depth later on but for now i also
want to touch on another really interesting bit that scott from nerd sync brought up he said that being
media literate means knowing the difference between plot and story it's really easy to confuse the idea of
plot versus story whereas like the plot is the stuff that happens like it's the list of things that happens
uh but what's like the story that the author is trying to tell through those things that happen
and so i think for me it's trying to find that story whether it's intended by the the author or
just something that i picked up through my reading or watching a couple weeks after i did those interviews
i actually sent scott a dm to tell him how integral this idea he'd brought up was to my video
he was super nice about it but admitted that he'd actually gotten it from a book
wired for story by lisa crone i told him that i was totally fine just pretending like he came up
with it on his own for the video so everyone be sure to leave a comment talking about how cool and
smart scott is but i did actually look into the book just to get some further context and you know
what's super interesting this isn't a book about how to be a better reader it's a book about how to be
a better writer so not only was plot versus story a really interesting framework on its own
but it also fit perfectly with the idea that media literacy is about both creating and consuming
media plot versus story also connected really well with something both star and lady emily mentioned
when it comes to art specifically people viewing art movies books games whatever as a form of like
plot delivery or just basic idea delivery rather than what is it trying to say what is it trying to do
that's on the surface level of they understand what is going on in the plot even if not every
single thing is directly spoon fed to them and also just kind of understanding the intent why is
this being shown to us why is this important and kind of gleaning additional information from that
and i feel like most people have a good grasp of the former but the latter i feel like is where
a lot of people sometimes struggle and then that's where it causes problems occasionally the other
thing i really like about the plot versus story framework is that it can be applied to all kinds
of media literacy not just fiction like if you're reading a news article you have the plot which is
the literal words on the page the factual information that the journalist wrote but you also have the
story which is the rhetorical purpose of the article what the journalist is trying to get you to feel
or do along with all of the other context like where and when it was published this actually solved some
of the issues i had with the academic research on media literacy earlier i mentioned that it seemed
like when academics talk about media literacy they were usually referring to how people engage with
non-fiction like news but when the general public talks about it they're usually talking about how
people engage with fiction like movies and books it always felt like there was some fundamental
difference between what each of those groups meant when they used the term but now i realize that no
media literacy is both of those things though all that being said even after these interviews i still
hadn't found a perfect definition of media literacy i was starting to get a better idea of what it meant
though and i realized that maybe it's elusiveness as a concept is actually part of it media literacy is
all the things my interviewees said and all the things the research articles said too it is a whole
bunch of skills like looking under the surface asking questions about how and why things are made
thinking about the contexts in which things are made and using those skills on both fiction and
non-fiction both as a consumer and a creator media literacy is complicated and maybe the fact that it's
so complicated is part of why people struggle with it so much but now that i knew that now that i knew
just how messy this topic was i could start to actually confront the problem i could start to
solve the media literacy crisis except when i asked my guests about this crisis a lot of them
didn't think it existed the consensus actually seemed to be that people have always been bad at being
critical consumers it's just that now thanks to the internet we're all a lot more aware of the problem
than we used to be yes there is a crisis however i think it's perpetual uh i think there's always
been a crisis there probably always will because you cannot be an expert in everything at all times
i would say that like a lack of like deeper thinking and understanding has probably existed for
a long time i guess maybe the reason why people these days are like it's a crisis is because we have
access to so many things now so much knowledge now but part of me feels like some level of this has
like existed for forever i don't know if i would call it a crisis i feel as though there's always been
bad media analysis out there and uh social media has just made it more common honestly it seemed
like at every single turn this video was just getting more and more complicated i had just gotten a
handle on what media literacy meant and then as soon as i tried to move on to solving the problem
now suddenly i had to consider that maybe there wasn't even a problem to solve in the first place
was it even worth making a video about media literacy if there's not a crisis
well there's good news and there's bad news the good news is that there may not be a media literacy
crisis the bad news is that there still is a crisis happening that's the the overview of my view on
media literacy right now i think it's symptomatic as opposed to uh the source of the problem i don't
think the singular focus on it uh addresses the problem that we observe when we say media literacy
crisis i do not think that there is a media literacy crisis i think the crisis is imperialism and
capitalism and it has been this way forever i think it's a it's part of a constantly morphing
crisis which is uh our state of affairs our systems there wasn't some kind of perfectly ideal media
literate past that we've fallen from over the past couple of decades but clearly there is something
wrong right reddit has countless threads about how walter white was a hero and thanos was morally
correct facebook is full of people who can't tell the difference between a real photograph and
whatever this is every single content creator i know has gotten comments from people who are mad
about something they didn't even say in their video i've personally experienced several instances of
people asking questions that they could find the answer to if they just took a single second to
look at the description something is wrong we all feel it we all see it so what is happening if media
literacy is about asking questions about the media you're consuming or creating then bad media literacy
is when you don't do that so what is stopping people from doing that well there's quite a few potential
answers it's possible that people are just lazier or less intelligent than we used to be but i think
that's a deeply uncurious answer to this problem because people don't exist in a vacuum and we're all
products of our environments and the systems we're living within insert coconut tree joke here so
instead of blaming individuals let's take a look at this environment and all these systems and see if they
have any answers for us while i was thinking through all of this the most obvious answer to me was that
people aren't asking questions about their media because asking questions takes time and like i talked
about in my video on efficiency a lot of our systems prioritize speed and immediacy at all costs this
was actually something a couple of people brought up during our interviews i think media literacy is having
the ability to interpret the information that you are consuming in a rational manner and now with
social media and technology that all that really means is just not having the instantaneous reaction that
these systems and platforms are designed to make you have to like or to share or to quote and and talk
or whatever they're going to be like oh i have to get in the comments and react to this immediately
because that is sort of what the internet culture is is i have to have an opinion i have to have a
reaction very quickly rather than sitting with it and and thinking about it so it almost is sort of like
i wonder if the youtube comments in general is part of potentially a problem of everyone being like oh i want
to be the first to comment this i have to have an opinion a reaction so quickly rather than just like
that was interesting let me sit with this a little bit so for me with stuff like velma it's it was
important to me to get in front of it and be like let's not be too hasty here is stuff stuff to get
excited for um and trying to be open-minded about it because if i don't have an immediate reaction the
people who will are the people who are going to say horrible bigoted things i mean they're going to say it
it is hard because i wish i could take the time and like you know marinate in it and sort of be
like here are my full thoughts but because the people i don't like are going to say their thoughts
immediately it does sort of pressure me to be like well i have to get my thoughts out quick also really
quick because i don't want them to be the only voices out there that people are listening to
in other words social media and the internet more generally incentivizes immediate reactions this is
clear in some obvious ways like how you're rewarded when you post about a trending topic because
algorithms favor relevance and recency but there are also some features of social media that we don't
really stop to think about that also play into this like how you're able to comment on a youtube
video you haven't watched or share a link on facebook to an article you haven't read one of
the reasons for this is that a lot of our media is focused on making things as easy as possible for
consumers restricting your ability to immediately comment with whatever gut reaction something made
you feel would be frustrating and people might feel like they were being censored on top of this
the algorithms used by youtube and amazon provide hyper individualized recommendations so you
don't have to waste time looking for what you want everything is made to be easy straightforward and
uncomplicated and this is true for our art too generally speaking at a societal level we like easy
stuff we like the easy melodrama of soap operas and cw shows we like the self-indulgent fan service
in marvel and star wars we like the simple familiar three act hero's journey but while we like all those
things they don't prompt us to ask questions they don't surprise us they don't take risks they're
designed to be easy it's the media equivalent of junk food we love to doom scroll and binge watch and
not have to think too hard about what we're consuming just like we love to eat fatty salty foods that are
convenient and easy if not nutritionally dense sure it hits all those short-term pleasure receptors in
our brains but at what cost and just to be clear i'm not trying to media shame or food shame anyone
all of these things are enjoyable and that's okay i like salt and vinegar potato chips and i like
watching compilations of baby animals i spend a not insignificant amount of time watching videos of
animals my friends know this about me they will send me videos of small animals multiple times a
week shout out to my friends anyway this difference between easy media and more cognitively engaging
media is outlined really well by stephen johnson in his book everything bad is good for you now just as
a disclaimer this book is about pop culture but it came out in 2006 so some of the references are a little
dated but i still think it has some really interesting insights like for instance johnson
suggests that one of the differences between shows that are more or less cognitively rigorous is about
how much information they give the viewer the open question posed by these sequences and more rigorous
media is not how will this turn out in the end the question is what's happening right now
sorkin's shows like the west wing are the narrative equivalent of fog machines you're supposed to be
in the dark you're supposed to be confused he goes on to argue that when media holds back information and
requires more engagement from the viewer not only is that good for us but it's also more enjoyable
part of the pleasure in these modern television narratives comes from the cognitive labor you're forced
to do filling in the details but if that's the case then what does the industry have to gain from
making stuff that requires such little media literacy well when we've become so used to media
that gives us easy answers whenever a film doesn't show every single detail of the world or story or
character relationships people get mad at things that aren't explained and so media that tries to give
audiences that pleasure of cognitive labor is often punished at the box office or torn apart on twitter for
being confusing or having plot holes i'm just gonna say it we don't need prequels and origin stories
for every single character in a major franchise we don't need an extended universe that fills in world
building gaps for us we should be able to do that work on our own we should want to do that work on our
own because just like how movie monsters are scarier the less we see of them fictional worlds are more
magical the less the author stops to explain every single detail about them but it also comes down to
risk when media is easier to consume there's a lower barrier to entry and less danger of misinterpretation
or misunderstanding it might not be high art but it's inoffensive so it can appeal to a wider audience
and wide appeal is really attractive to people who are in the business of art this is why it's such a
huge deal when more intellectually challenging media does well commercially when everything everywhere all
at once came out i don't think anyone was expecting such a weird movie to do so well with general
audiences but even still it did run into some issues with misinterpretations and misunderstandings
for instance when my husband and i saw it in theaters there was a group of women behind us
probably like college age a couple years younger than us at the time and when the movie ended he and
i were just sat there like emotionally processing what we just watched and one of the women behind us
turned to her friend and said so do you think they're gonna make a sequel to explain what happened
and i think about that at least once a week during my discussion with lily she brought up a really
interesting point related to how we could solve this issue though patrick h willems he was talking
about i think it was in his video what's next after marvel um basically the need for movies that train
people to watch movies again um for movies that get people like eased back into ambiguity or like
plot lightness and i feel like challengers was one he cited there i am a huge fan i loved it and i think
that is one that uh it's it's extremely accessible but it's also it's also weird and like watching that
movie and also seeing that movie be a big success made me feel hopeful you know for like movies that
can come along and bridge the gap and get us making like movies for grown-ups again i really like this
but i also think that we shouldn't necessarily assume that even the most straightforward training
wheel movies are immune from poor media literacy because for example this is such an embarrassing story
so you know in the dark knight the refrain you either die a hero or live long enough to see
yourself become the villain it took me probably like eight years of like half a dozen viewings
before i understood that that is literally harvey dent's character arc in the film and they just say it
like they just say it out loud several times like it's not it's not subtext it's text
and i i have a graduate degree in english i have pretty good media literacy i think um and i think
about that a lot i remember when i realized it i remember when i realized what they had meant and it
was this like i literally was sitting on the couch and like gasped holy oh please like and subscribe i
you know you you live and you learn and
sometimes we need to be a little patient with ourselves
anyway all of that is to say that sometimes people won't be able to pick up on even the most obvious
of themes but another part of the issue with the entertainment industry is that just like how
social media tries to quantify human interaction studios are trying to quantify art this was actually
something that jose brought up during our discussion so i'll let him explain it i get annoyed when people
try to build this idea of consensus around movies we all have to like or dislike something as an objective
fact but we sort of see these people who are so insistent that their opinions about a piece of
media are the right ones that they've tried to sort of fashion this idea of objective criticism they're
so uh obsessed with rotten tomato scores and stuff like that and they're trying to sort of uh formulate
some kind of objective measure of quality for a piece of media which is incredibly silly and ridiculous
they're not just coming at it like as one opinion of many they are getting closer to the objective truth
that's i think why they get into like down votes on youtube videos like that means anything
for a lot of people with poor media literacy numbers are a really easy metric for understanding
media why would you worry about actually analyzing a film to understand its strengths and weaknesses
when you could just look at its rotten tomatoes score instead and on the industry side making art
objective and quantifiable makes it easier to figure out the most efficient method of dispensing that
art as we've seen with the rise of binge watching thanks to streaming services and we're not just
seeing this with movies either there's been a recent rise in book summary apps and i find that
absolutely fascinating now obviously things like cliff's notes have been around forever but now we
have short form blinkist and magibook which aren't helpful guides to books they're literally just
summaries of books and something that all of these services emphasize is how easy they're making things
they take confusing ideas and explain them in plain and simple ways never get confused by a complicated
book again i don't know if you've seen these ads for magibook but they are wild there's a couple of
videos that i've seen from folks breaking down exactly what they do and how terrible it is so i won't
get too much into it here but suffice it to say making something simpler doesn't necessarily make it
better but if you see books not as art that's made with intention but instead as a quantifiable
and infinitely reducible data point of which you need to sell as many units as possible then of
course it makes sense to reduce it down until it's as easy as possible to consume but this focus on
ease of use is also a big factor in another media literacy issue the spread of misinformation online
part of this is because as mike caulfield puts it the primary use of misinformation is not to change
the beliefs of other people at all instead the vast majority of misinformation is offered as a service
for people to maintain their beliefs in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary in other words
it's confirmation bias social media actually thrives on confirmation bias because while changing
your beliefs is hard maintaining them having them catered to being told what you want to hear
is easy and like i've said over and over again brains like easy so social media companies aren't
incentivized to combat these algorithms and instead just focus on giving users what they want and that's
to say nothing of how much youtube and facebook actually directly profit off of grifters but just
because these systems aren't incentivized to change doesn't mean that we're stuck like this now
unfortunately a lot of solutions for these big picture problems are unsatisfying like i mentioned
earlier most articles and organizations focus on education as a panacea to media literacy issues
and i think that's just a lazy answer one of the books i read for this video is a non-fiction graphic
novel a fire hose of falsehood the story of disinformation and i think that it can be a really valuable
resource like it has some really interesting stuff on the history of propaganda but this whole book talks
about the fire hose the big institutional forces that overload us with information and its solution to that
issue wear a raincoat so first of all that metaphor really falls apart because the danger of a fire hose
isn't the water it's the pressure sure wearing a raincoat will probably keep your clothes from
getting wet but it's still gonna hurt and second of all like i said earlier i'm skeptical of any solution
that comes down to just teach more media literacy in school when you have such powerful forces bombarding
you with information and misinformation and disinformation it doesn't really seem fair to put the responsibility
entirely on the individual rather than trying to protect yourself from the fire hose doesn't it make
more sense to just turn the hose off now to be fair to this book the authors do offer other suggestions
for how to protect societies from the proverbial fire hose of falsehood they bring up regulations on
businesses especially social media as well as safeguarding free press and repairing the public sphere and
these are solutions that have been echoed by other media literacy scholars like dana boyd and her
article did media literacy backfire now i don't love every single thing she says in this article but
there are some gems that i think are really helpful for understanding the scope of our society-wide
media literacy struggle she argues that media literacy programs and solutions that focus on expert fact
checking and labeling are likely to fail not because they are bad ideas but because they fail to take
into consideration the cultural context of information consumption that we've created over the last 30
years addressing so-called fake news is going to require a lot more than labeling it's going to require a
cultural change about how we make sense of information whom we trust and how we understand our own role
in grappling with information in other words we've built this huge tangled attention economy web and
there's so much baggage associated with it like all the algorithm stuff i brought up at the beginning of
this section that surface level issues like labeling misinformation aren't ever going to be enough
what we need to do is untangle the web the question of how we untangle the web is complicated
some people like ben and elliot argue that we need big picture radical societal change for one to just
start radically changing systems of education systems of media just just sort of radically undermine
capital you know the more that you undermine capital and bring power into the hands of workers and in
the hands of non-proletarian working-class people in the hands of people who are underprivileged in the hands of
people who are disabled the more that you do that the less of the less you'll feel there's a problem
with media literacy but until the revolution happens dana boyd suggests in her article that we instead
get creative and build the social infrastructure necessary for people to meaningfully and substantively
engage across existing structural lines this won't be easy or quick but if we want to address issues
issues like propaganda hate speech fake news and biased content we need to focus on the underlying
issues at play no simple band-aid will work part of the problem with this though is that there's been
an erosion of trust in a lot of the institutions that make up this social infrastructure for instance
people are becoming more skeptical of higher education but especially of the humanities and the
humanities are the home of media literacy studies actual humanities education of like thinking and
reading and writing is on the decline on the average in our society because we we don't like assign a
value to it really i would situate this in the context of a growing resentment for like humanities and
liberal arts in general you know i i get the feeling that people don't understand or can't quantify the
benefit that those sort of like disciplines give and like universities all over the world are are slashing
humanities funding to make room for more like stem funding i'm not saying that these solutions are
doomed to fail i actually have a lot of hope for these kinds of things i'm fatally optimistic about
this kind of stuff but like boyd said this won't be easy or quick so until we actually can turn off
that fire hose of falsehood and stop our systems from incentivizing poor media literacy there has to be
something we can do in the meantime right if we don't have the power to turn off the fire hose
we should at least put on a raincoat now i know that i've just spent the past however many minutes
arguing that the problem is systems and that is true i know that there is no individual solution that
is a perfect panacea for any of the big picture issues i talked about i know that but just because
certain behaviors are incentivized that doesn't mean that we should just roll over and give up there
are ways that we as individuals can practice better media habits including by using the sponsor of
today's video mylanote mylanote is a tool for organizing creative projects and it essentially
functions as a virtual whiteboard i'm a really visual person so whenever i'm working through an
especially difficult topic for a video i need a place where i can map out all my ideas i'd actually
started outlining on a physical poster board with markers and post-it notes but my problem is that
i'm quite verbose and physical media have physical limitations but mylanote on the other hand can handle
all the chaos and wordiness that i threw at it i created a subboard just for mapping out all the
different ideas that came up during my interviews as a way to see how the different conversations
overlapped and find common connections and themes i know it looks chaotic but that's the writing
process i taught writing for almost five years i have a graduate degree in this this chaos is normal
and healthy and if you have a chaotic writing process like me i promise mylanote can handle it
whether you're writing essays or novels or even just trying to organize your thoughts creating a visual
for it can be really helpful in helping you slow down and critically think about your ideas and
whatever you're working on mylanote has a template for it they've got mood boards graphic design
filmmaking every kind of writing project i actually started this board using the novel outline template
and then customized it to fit my chaotic writing process and for those of you who do collaborative
projects you can easily share the board with others who can leave feedback using the comments feature
or even work on your board together in real time they also have a mobile app that i've been using a
lot to write myself notes as i come up with ideas so i'm one of those people who always used to just
text myself ideas or links but the mylanote app is so much more convenient because it automatically
syncs with your computer mylanote is available for free with no time limits and you can sign up using my
link mylanote.com slash zoe b which is also in the description and in the pinned comment i genuinely
have really enjoyed my time using mylanote and it actually came in clutch for this video with how
much it helped me to organize the mess that this topic became i mean you saw how chaotic my writing
process is so i was really genuinely impressed with how easy it was to use i cannot recommend it enough
again that link is mylanote.com slash zoe b and thank you again to mylanote for sponsoring but let's
get back to the video as for more actionable advice number one is slow the down like i talked about in
the last section none of the systems that we're living within want us to slow down social media
incentivizes quick gut reactions and posting about trending topics even if you haven't had time to
evaluate the evidence or sit and think about your position everything in our culture is telling us to
speed up to be more efficient to consume as much content as possible but the good news is that once
you're aware of these forces you can start to work against them for instance you can take steps to make
sure you're not just consuming short-form media stephen johnson might not have had any idea of what
the internet would become in 2006 when he was writing everything that is good for you but in it he argued
that the internet possesses a different kind of intelligence from the intelligence delivered by reading a
sustained argument for 200 pages you can convey attitudes and connections in the online world
with ease you can brainstorm with 20 strangers in a way that would have been unthinkable just 10
now 30 years ago but it is harder to transmit a fully fledged worldview the cognitive immersion of
a novel requires a physical immersion for the effect to work you have to commit to the book spend long
periods of time devoted to it if you only read in short bites the effect fades like a moving image
dissolving into a sequence of frozen pictures i know books are slow and tedious but that's a feature
not a bug short-form media is fine but long-form media is also important especially for nuanced topics
the most important piece of advice when slowing the down though comes down to one single concept
media all media is made with intention as a writer and a poet i can assure you that every single word
a writer chooses is chosen for a reason so whenever you feel a strong emotional reaction towards something
pause before you comment on it or share it use that pause to ask yourself questions about what you just
saw media is made with intention so what kind of intentions might have been put into this what do you think
the author is trying to do with this thing they made who do you think they made it for and once
you've asked yourself those questions then you can decide if what you're feeling is fair or not and
then you can decide on how you want to proceed with sharing it or leaving a comment this is especially
true if what you're reading is challenging you either intellectually or ethically like i talked about
in the last section our brains really don't like to be challenged and a lot of things in our environment
have taken advantage of that and now a big chunk of our media diet is made up of easy unchallenging
stuff so when you're faced with something that does challenge you whether it's because the writing
is difficult or because it approaches its themes in an ethically ambiguous way or because it's just
clearly coming at a topic from an opinion that is radically different from yours it can be off-putting
at first it's frustrating when things don't give easy comfortable answers and it's okay if your gut
reaction to something like that is frustration it's okay if your instinct is to be defensive that's
normal all i'm asking is that you don't let that frustration and defensiveness be your only reaction
when you feel that way let yourself feel it and then start asking questions about what you just saw
one of the reasons this is so hard to practice though is because it requires trusting writers it requires
understanding that media is made through conscious choices and that those choices have been made in
good faith but it can often feel hard to trust writers because we have so much non-conscientious
art out there we've been burned one too many times by art that promises to be deep or interesting
and then falls apart at the slightest analysis or is just maddeningly transparent and that's not even
considering the rise of ai generated images and writing which are by definition made without
intention so if you want to build up what johnson calls a kind of implicit trust a tolerance for planned
ambiguity then you need to start slowing down and asking yourself questions like if a writer keeps
using a specific color in a certain way like i don't know if an important scene is set in a room with
blue curtains it might be worth considering why that decision was made of all the things the writer
could have described they chose to describe the curtains and of all the colors they could have used
they used blue isn't that interesting isn't that worth at least just thinking about and yes sometimes
the reason behind a certain decision isn't super deep especially for films where budget can be a huge
constraint sometimes decisions are made because they're cheap not because of some deeper artistic
meaning and this also isn't to say that authorial intent is the most important thing in analysis
either contrary to what some people on twitter believe you can be pro media literacy and pro death
of the author at the same time just fine because while it's important to consider authorial intent especially
for non-fiction media sometimes there's enough evidence in the text to make an argument that the
author didn't even think about sometimes it's not even intentional sometimes people are getting a
message across like they're delivering a message in their work that is more representative of like
what they think and what their ideals are and they may not think that that's like what they're
doing when they create that piece of work but that is like what ends up coming through it's like with
tolkien tolkien states that he hates allegory there are clear allegorical elements in the lord of the
rings so regardless of him saying he hates it you can find those elements in there that's why folks can
bring their own meaning and extricate that from the text even when the author didn't intend for it to
happen but this is also somewhat related to one of the most common misunderstandings about media literacy
the idea that media analysis is just a matter of opinion believe it or not there is a difference
between analysis which is aided by good media literacy and opinion which is just vibes when
you're talking about what a piece of media means that is analysis when you're talking about whether a
piece of media is enjoyable or not that's an opinion the textbook the media and me a guide to critical
media literacy for young people explains it this way when we adopt a critical stance toward media we ask
questions about meaning which is open to multiple interpretations including competing interpretations
this situation might be enough to make you throw up your hands in despair and say who cares it's all just
a matter of opinion in the end this is when validity and a host of principles that can help give us
confidence that a statement or story is true come to the rescue some differences of interpretation are
a matter of opinion but many differences of interpretation can be resolved by considering the
evidence for and against each of the competing interpretations the idea that the validity of different
interpretations of a work comes down to evidence is actually the underlying foundation of literary
analysis that's what my high school ap english teacher told us over and over you can argue anything
you want about a text you can take any meaning you want from it as long as you have the evidence to back
it up there are some interpretations that have more evidence than others and those are usually the ones
that english teachers like to say are the correct interpretations it's like how we have scientific
theories that we might not be able to technically call facts but for which there is so much evidence
that for all intents and purposes they can be taken as facts the meaning of the green light in the great
gatsby is just like gravity sure it's technically just a theory but the evidence is overwhelming and trying
to argue that it's just an opinion is going to make you look deeply unserious but when it comes to your
own personal experience with art you're allowed to have whatever opinions you want you're allowed i'm an
english teacher and i am telling you you are allowed to have feelings about a book or a movie or a video
essay even if those feelings aren't backed up by evidence you are allowed to feel things about art
and those feelings are valid the big question that you should have when you think about art and media
and things like that is is it's there to make you feel things explore that go for it like films are not
logic dispensing machines of information they're meant to be forms of art of entertainment of of you know
joy love and all these emotions one of the best things we can do is to allow ourselves to develop like
personal relationships with art even that like that go against the consensus or that just have nothing
to do with the consensus i think one of the best things for me was just like realizing that i have
a capacity to understand things you know like it's already there and it is not something that needs to be
drilled into me so much as something that i just need to like respect and give space that results in me
personally making a lot of connections that other people would consider like a stretch but uh it's
fine because because these are my my thoughts to have my feelings to have and like a richness of
perspectives on art is is the whole thing of it you know like if if there's only one correct takeaway
from a given thing then then what are we doing here what's what's even the point of paying attention
if you can just like get it all from a cliff's notes you know sometimes this character is wearing
a purple shirt just because i wanted them to be wearing a purple shirt it's not that deep but like
here's the thing though if you can take something from that i don't think that's a bad thing it might
not be what i intended but that does not devalue what you're getting out of it right like i just
because it was not intentional does not mean that it is a bad interpretation to have i don't think
i know that i dedicated a whole bit to talking about the importance of intentionality and trusting
that art is made with intention but if what matters most to you is your experience with a piece of art
don't let anyone take that away from you but honestly all the advice i just gave is pretty milk toast
right to quote an actual academic media literacy article if the issue were so simple we could stop
writing here and move on to continue advocating for the implementation of these criteria through
various educational programs yet the situation is far from simple the situation is far from simple
and something that's important to keep in mind is that one of the main reasons i wanted to make a video
about media literacy was because of how it personally affected me as a creator i felt like a
lot of the negative comments i got on my videos were from people with poor media literacy skills who
just didn't get what i was saying and to some extent i still think that's true i do believe that
generally speaking people on the internet could do a much better job of being thoughtful and critical
consumers and i think that all of the advice i just gave is valuable and we should all try to be more
conscientious when we interact with media online all the people i interviewed also wanted to see
better media literacy on the internet especially in their creative spaces and clearly we know what
good media literacy looks like so how do we make it happen well my interviewees had a lot of ideas
jose emily and scott suggested essentially tricking people into learning by making media literacy fun on
its own or hiding it in pop culture analysis star and alex had a similar point but leaned into
the idea that people most readily change their minds based on personal relationships and empathy
they suggested that the best way forward was to talk about media literacy in patient personable ways
and noah emily and babilla suggested modeling the types of behaviors we want to see from our viewers
all of these suggestions are really helpful and i think most essayists do some form of them already
to mixed results for instance there's one creator who i won't name uh who made a video about media
literacy and didn't put any of their sources in the description and i noticed that there were no
comments that mentioned that so like this creator was talking about media literacy telling people how to be
more literate including telling them to check sources but they didn't put their sources in the description
and like there were even people in the comments who were talking a big game about how media literate they
are and how they check sources for everything that they watch except for that video i guess
anyway all of that is to say that modeling good media literacy is hard for me i personally believe
that media literacy has a lot to do with intellectual humility and keeping an open mind and so for me
practicing my own media literacy i often go into discussions fully prepared to be wrong about
things and while that's sometimes a good perspective to have it's one that can easily go off the rails
for example it's probably not a good perspective to have if you are a content creator who gets hundreds
and hundreds of comments telling you that you're wrong all for slightly different reasons because
then you might find yourself questioning every single word you've ever written or every single opinion
you've had and even just like the most basic things that you might even have like a graduate degree in
hypothetically of course i try to be intellectually humble to see my worldview as open to improvement from new
evidence and the experience of others as a lynch puts it but historically that has not gone well for me
but luckily i'm not alone in that almost every other creator i talked to also tended to internalize
comments and second guess themselves when i receive comments that are like you did a really bad job with
this that and the other i'm like oh my god you're right i did even if it's not true i tend to have to
like run them by um my best friend and be like what do you think unfortunately your comments hurt me
and i will be like oh my god i am i'm they're right i am literally satan or if someone's arguing
something in the comments even if it's especially if it's something that i actually did explain
in the video and i'll be like i definitely talked about this in the video it'll be a lot of like
oh man i guess i should have worded it better i should have formatted my the structure of the
video better so yeah i will i will just think like oh well i should have done better and i'll try to
do better next time and then that just adds up over time but what do you do about that if media
literacy is about considering evidence and acknowledging that you could be wrong how can
you honestly do that as a content creator without sacrificing your mental health or integrity well
lynch argues that having intellectual humility doesn't mean you lack an ego you just don't put
your ego before truth to be open to learning from others you need to be confident enough to realize
what you know and what you don't intellectual humility is not an opponent of conviction you don't
need to thoughtfully reconsider your views about racism when talking to the white supremacists on
your doorstep and one reason you don't has to do with the core meaning of intellectual humility it
means in part being open to the evidence supplied by the experience and testimony of others but evidence
here is key just because someone comes up to you and says the earth is flat doesn't mean you have to
take that statement seriously you can be intellectually humble without to paraphrase a well-known expression
being so open-minded that your brain just falls out so how do i do that how do i thread that needle
how do i know which comments i should listen to and which i should ignore well there were several good
pieces of advice that the others shared with me jose and star both said that they take the volume or
frequency of comments into account if you have just one really angry comment then whatever they're
upset about is probably a them thing but if there are several comments all talking about a particular
point in your work then maybe that's something you should think about but as part of this job you also
have to learn how to put up with reading the most terrible things that people think about you that's
just part of this and like lola said during our conversation that can really take a toll on you
i actually feel like i have really thick skin because you have to in order to do this job and not lose
your mind um because every day on the internet people are like threatening to kill rape me they're you
know commenting on my appearance they're commenting on the way i speak and it's especially hard i'll say it
like if you're a woman um and if you're not like the most conventionally attractive people in your
comments section tend to be split down the middle of like yes mommy uwu which is disgusting you know
lots of sexualization if like it just dealt with tons and tons of weird sexualization my entire career
like which is painful in its own way um but it's also better than people so much better than people
being like i think you're ugly and therefore i'm going to kill you yep yeah i get a lot of like
why doesn't your husband beat you more which is great you love to see it but why do people leave
comments and not just the terrible ones but in general honestly what is the comment section even for
no one really knows star emily nick and alex suggested that people leave comments because
they just want to be seen and heard it's not so much that people want attention though for some
especially the more inflammatory comments that is probably the case it's more of a parasocial or
community building thing others like babilla elliot and noah argue that it's more about strong
emotional reactions people comment because they get riled up for one reason or another would it be like
too meta to at this point in the video do like a call to action to leave a comment maybe not yeah um
leave a comment telling me why you leave comments like do you only answer questions that creators give
uh is it one of these reasons that i've just talked about um i don't know maybe that is i i should have
formally in the script said like do a call to action here but the foresight is not my strong suit
but maybe as alex pointed out to me focusing on comments is actually just missing the point
feel like people don't engage with youtube videos as something that is made with intent and i think
that if people did engage better in those ways um that they would be more media literate and also
leave better youtube comments i don't know if there was a question in there i'm going to disagree
with you oh no okay no it's fine it's good because you know i come from a perspective of don't trust
the youtuber yeah okay that's clearly my outcome so what that individual is doing is trying to treat
critically and um potentially making a comment not for you i see because we as youtubers have a tendency
to be so focused on the channel being us that comments we feel are directed to us and even those
that call us out directly are not necessarily directed to us so to assume their intent i think
is following we have created a location a location surrounding a specific topic the town square where
people are electronically sharing ideas some of those are not directed towards us so when a person points
those things out it doesn't mean you so made a mistake in forgetting these things it is an individual
who may be trying to provide the context to someone else so what you're telling me is that i need to
work on my media literacy and how i engage with comments and maybe i should be thinking more about how
comments themselves are also as a piece of media in this world made with intent and rhetorical choices
yes i don't like that answer it makes me mad because it means that i don't have that i'm not that my
righteous indignation about youtube comments is perhaps misplaced but it is a good answer nonetheless
one that i will have to think about sorry
also he has a great video all about this specific question of trusting content creators on his channel
legal kimchi which i will have linked in the description it is amazing and i definitely
recommend watching it when this is over but this idea that i was missing the point that i was getting
something wrong about my position as a creator and my relationship to the comments it stuck with me
i could not stop thinking about it i chewed on that conversation for a solid two weeks and that's when
it hit me remember media literacy isn't just about how to be a good consumer of media it's also about how
to be a good creator of media so maybe the problem isn't with viewers or at least not just with viewers
maybe i and all the people i talk to for this video am more responsible for this than i first thought
this revelation was frustrating i was so sure that people misinterpreting my videos or misunderstanding
my arguments was just a miscommunication and if i just taught people how to be more critical viewers
and if i did a better job crafting my arguments and modeling good media literacy then everyone would end
up in agreement and it would be a wonderful little space with only positive comments and thoughtful
discussion but that just isn't how it works there's always going to be what you put out there and
what people come to the table with we also must accept that everyone is human and sometimes the the
complementary item to what we put out there what these folks bring to the table isn't there to meet
us you know you're always no matter how well you write something going to have someone who looks at
it sees the title and thumbnail watches 20 seconds of it and then hallucinates an argument into it gets
really mad at you and leaves a scathing comment and i posited to you the last time we talked about
this that this was perhaps a type of media literacy in and of itself but i think learning to accept that
people will always do that and that that's okay and that maybe it feels a little bleak and like
negative on human nature but that it's kind of undeniable i think that's like a skill to learn
and um i think it's okay to not be perfect at that all the time and that it's kind of a goal to strive
towards is like learning to yeah make sure that you're making a quality product and you know maybe
providing resources to people so that they can try and come to the table and understand it with you
and you know really try and get at that shared meaning really try and exist in the world together
but sometimes it won't be possible and learning to accept that is um i think important to not
stressing about those people ultimately some amount of people are always going to disagree with you um
you can't make everyone like you because if everyone likes you then you've probably said nothing
that's like i think true of just like being a human you know so maybe the real media literacy issue
was on my end maybe as a creator i need to have the media literacy to understand that it's
literally impossible to create something perfect that no one could ever misinterpret even the best
writers with the greatest most thoughtful fans won't reach everyone there will always be people who
just don't get it and that's a fact of life and it's a fact that i actually really struggle with
even now even after doing all of this reading and having all of these conversations and honestly
maybe that means that this video is useless i mean i've spent all this time trying to craft the
perfect media literacy video that teaches everyone all these skills and does a full comprehensive
breakdown of just how complicated it all is and maybe it's a fruitless endeavor maybe video essays as
a genre are just a waste of time because if you can't change people's minds then what's even the point
but then i talked to my friend star and star the starfish face creator of the webcomic cast off of which
i am the number one fan she told me something that i think every single artist needs to hear
and so like everybody comes at a piece of media from their own experience equipped with their own
knowledge past experiences and how much they are willing to connect with it and you cannot account for
every single one of those people when you make something all you can hope is that it hits the right
target audience and that the people who are finding it and are enjoying it are getting something out of
it because like i said earlier i was really struggling back when my audience first got really
big that people were not reading the story the way i had intended they were not interpreting the
characters the way that i interpret them as their creator i i had this almost legitimate crisis of like
this story is being taken away from me and that's very hard it's like death of the author but i'm like
i'm still working on it it was something that i was really really struggling with and i remember i
went to a talk given by another comic artist and something she said really stuck with me it was
something along the lines of all you can hope is that this piece of media is the thing that someone
needs at this exact moment you think back to like all the shows all the books that came to you at
just the right moment and said exactly what you needed them to say the only thing you can hope is
that that is something that your work is that for someone you as the creator cannot control how people
react to the things that you make and if they interpret it differently than you intended who
cares right like it's it's not a reflection on you it's a reflection on them more than anything and
just try not to take it personally and create something that's meaningful to you and with any luck
it'll be meaningful to other people who really need it in the moment and that's all we can hope for right
so where does that leave us well i think that's up to interpretation but what i'm choosing to focus
on moving forward is the idea that conflicting ideas can coexist we should be able to acknowledge
that humanity is diverse and that diversity is going to be reflected in a diversity of opinion but we
should also be able to do so without compromising our own values i'm going to continue to try to
model good media literacy and teach people the skills to engage with media in more literate more curious
ways even if i know that cognitive biases and systemic forces are working against me and if i want people to
trust me as a creator maybe i need to prove over and over again that i'm worthy of that trust because
when we all slow down take more time to think about things practice more curiosity and humility and
open-mindedness we all win society wins and society wins not because we've manipulated everyone into
agreeing with us or because we've destroyed all the people who disagree with us society wins because
media literacy is inherently democratic because when we're all more media literate we're more open to
understanding others viewpoints even if we don't agree with them as michael lynch puts it in know-it-all
society we should not give up on truth and humility and neither information pollution nor
polarization should make us abandon them when we own what we don't know and remain open to what others do
we exemplify a basic respect for our fellow citizens that is demanded by democracy we may never
completely realize the ideal of respect the ideal of living in a society that treats people equally that
achieves social justice that values truth and reason and that rejects arrogance and dogmatism but
these are goals worth striving for and it would be perverse to give up on them just when they're under
threat it is precisely then that democratic ideals matter most
thank you for sticking around until the end of the video this video was a lot i know that it took a
while to come out um but i hope that you liked it and if you did then be sure to like and comment and
share the video with your friends i also know that it was a little different than my usual stuff and
a lot longer than my usual stuff uh but honestly i really loved having all those conversations with
other creators so let me know if you like that and want to see more of it in future videos because i
will take any opportunity uh to talk to smart cool creative people i loved it it was great also i
completely forgot to say something while i was actually recording but i want to give a huge thank you to
all of the creators who agreed to be interviewed for this thank you so much it was genuinely a joy
to talk to all of you i will have all of their information in the description all of their channels
and everything so everyone please go check them out send them some love because this video would not
have been possible without all of them i also want to thank all of my patrons and members who made
this video possible all of their names are scrolling by over here but i want to give an especially huge
thanks to hugh sophia jared s justin lowry megan lowndes and shep alderson thank you all so very much
this video took a lot out of me it took two months longer than i intended it to it was supposed to be a
like may june video and then sometimes happens um it was also just really hard it was really
challenging to wrap my head around all this stuff and like get a handle on it but also the past few
months overlapped with one of the worst mental health ruts that i've had in years maybe ever um
so i hope that this video was helpful and engaging and good and useful and that you liked it because
i put a lot of myself into it um but anyway thank you again for watching and i would like to end with
my patron poem of the video for autumn here is cicada sometimes just sometimes i wish to be a cicada
who rests deep underground and wakes simply to scream and then leave the husk of who i was clinging and empty
and until next time stay safe stay warm and i will see y'all again soon i hope bye folks
and on the one hand can you stop sneezing hi my bookmark is a pokemon card make a movie called
everything everywhere that happened last time i love the fast and the furious movies i don't know
if there's much beyond those than like fast cars and people with big muscles it's family you're right it
is family and i i feel ashamed for not even saying that and that that should be first in mind you
could just wash my shit and then leave like you don't have to leave anything i want to just clip that
part to make you look like an asshole please honestly babilla says just watch my shit and leave
yeah let's start the campaign of me having haters it's it's time it's time for me to have some haters
you're too fucking nice to me um i couldn't actually handle it i'm too much but um everyone
please be nice to babilla please i'm i'm i'm i'm sensitive spoiler alert in case this makes it into
the video if you leave a meme comment on someone's video we are not upset by it if anything we're taking
a screenshot of it and showing it to our friends and having a laugh like we make fun of them in the
group chat all the time you are not hurting us you are providing us with giggles for our friends
i like how sometimes depending on where you're sitting it looks like it says king king king yeah
king yeah it says uh keep going they found it off of canva or something it's cute the public education
system is very challenging and always being defunded and things like that so um
um so fix that i guess so just fixing just just the entire education system if you fix the entire
education system i think we'll be okay i think we just fixed it right yeah i think we fixed you do
you do better uh you do better education the whole system and then also uh just cool people keep making
video essays i think that helps oh yeah i mean video essays are praxis i think so and if everyone thought the
same way that like i did about you know a scooby-doo cartoon if everyone thought that way then i
wouldn't have a job because i'd put that video out and they'd be like scott we already know this
so maybe selfishly the solution is to not do any of the things that i just said and have me fix it
personally oh yeah because we profit off of because we profit off of it and i do and that would be good
for me um so i think that would be good was video canceled i guess yeah actually if you post this
uh i'm gonna copyright strike it i'm gonna uh i'm gonna get it taken down
here's the thing zoe if you are actually smart and creative and insightful and inventive
you're not you're not you're gonna be the first person to think of stuff sometimes find more weird
stuff find more stuff that pushes the boundaries of your ways of understanding find the stuff that
like they're doing something that you just like don't understand and uh don't get mad at that you
know don't just have a reflexive thing of like oh this is pretentious or this isn't for me because
maybe it is give it a shot yeah if someone comes to you and they're like i think that the author just
wanted the curtains to be blue like i don't think that media like has intention in this way you're
never going to get them to understand the value of art or like what art has done for you by being
like oh the reason you think that is because you're stupid and illiterate if we want media literacy to
be spread around the world anger is not a useful response maybe it's justified maybe everyone should
be perfectly media literate and maybe everyone should care that the curtains are blue but we're not going
to get people to understand that art can change the world by yelling at them it's just not gonna happen
you're so sweet
thank you
