so good evening everybody my name is bernhard postard together with nick i'm holding the center
for applied dialectics cid and i'm very grateful nick that you are giving this evening's presentation
about the upcoming handbook of dialectical thinking i think it's not out yet and the more
uh you will um kind of tingle us and bring together more interested we're really curious about this next
upcoming book uh nick over to you brilliant well thank you very very much uh bernard and thank you
everyone uh for for being here this evening i call this a um a kind of preview uh on the basis that the
book will not be out i don't think until july uh it's in production at the moment um and of course
it's a bit of a harrowing time because when you go back and you see all the things that
um aren't quite right or you'd rather rethought or the punctuation is all over the place
your hair stands on end and you think how are we gonna get the final version in print perfectly but
um we'll see how we go i'm also kind of conscious that i've taken on uh probably a lot more than i
can chew in talking to you tonight the book has something like 265 000 words uh nearly 150 images
is 26 chapters and there's amazing breadth really of content um and scholarly insight
uh and work which is almost impossible for me to try and summarize uh in the course of an hour which
is what we have now uh but i thought it would be interesting anyway for you to get a feel for what
is in the book um and i'll try and pick out you know some of the main points that each of the various
authors have um have made in their chapters as best i can so let me uh take you through some slides
so the book is called the routledge international handbook of dialectical thinking and it's
it's part of a series that routledge bring out um of whole variety of different topics um
and uh for that reason we're a little bit constricted in terms of how we presented material
in it because it has to follow routledge's format one of those rather irritating things
uh and so some of the images that you're going to see uh this evening are not in color in the book
uh nevertheless the images are for me actually a very important part of the book uh they are
produced by a danish artist called lars faisant and lars has also written the foreword and i'm going
to show you here you can see six images of his uh the cover image uh which he titles pantare um after
heraclysis's work meaning everything flows and in that artwork you can see a stream um a river flowing
through time and space and the way um lars has actually put this work together is in um
collaboration with his partner who has produced a series of canvases of irregular shapes arranged here
in a circle so the motif is the circular or cyclical aspect of nature
so i thought that would be a brilliant image just for the cover of the book
just trying to capture some of the essence of of dialectic in nature
so why did we produce a book of dialectical thinking well one of the quotes that we've kind of
hung on to is that from shannon brinkat an australian academic specializes in international relations
and shannon came up with this phrase dialectical thinking is the antidote to dogma
and we just love that because looking around the world today there is so much dogma
and when we were trying to um put together a prospectus for the book michael muscolo uh did a
search on the ebscohost database for scientific papers including the word dialectical he turned up
over 5 000 of those papers um with a very large number of those being in psychology
but clearly there was nothing really out there which focuses on dialectical thinking
um despite the fact that dialectical thinking is such an important part of scientific work
so mike said dialectical scholarship is operating as a body of work but it's in search of discipline
we thought that if we could get a handbook out there then maybe that would be the start of building
dialectical thinking as a discipline
and this is how it all started this takes us back to 2016
uh when michael pascas was the keynote speaker at the esrarad conference in the hague and you can see
him there uh almost in the center uh with me next to him um so at that meeting a number of russians turned up
uh fronted by nikolai vraxa who's the guy on the left there
and nikolai had been working for a long period of time on dialectical thinking but focusing on the
dialectical thinking of children and that created a kind of interesting new viewpoint new perspective
because we'd always seen dialectical thinking as a sort of post-formal using a piagetian term
form of thinking and so we began to have discussions as to what was this conception of dialectical thinking
that the russians had and how did it relate to dialectical thinking as proposed by michael basakas
and what nikolai vraxa decided to do was to hold a symposium in moscow the following year
which some of us went to and that followed on with a second symposium in 2019 at moscow state university
where i think michael said how about let's produce a book and so planning began
well it wasn't necessarily a particularly smooth path
because just as we got going covid broke out and then subsequently the war in ukraine
so we spent a lot of time talking about the book over zoom as you can see here and that led us to an
interesting process really because we were able to present our thinking about individual chapters
to each other and have each other kind of critique those ideas and develop our thinking really as a
group we got a lot of kind of intellectual satisfaction from those meetings but eventually we had to get
down to writing so so we stopped having the zoom meetings and focus people on a deadline
so what were we trying to achieve with this book well um
um firstly what exactly is dialectical thinking and how can it be recognized and then why is it
important and what problems can it help solve and how might it operate within different academic
disciplines and between those disciplines and then lastly how does it develop in humans
so my task along with mike muscolo and anastasia belalutskaya was to try and corral our authors
into writing as much as they could about about these topics and this is what we ended up with
we started with some form of introduction just to explain the basic concepts and
methodologies involved in research
we then developed some knowledge about origins of dialectical thinking and theories about dialectical
thinking and then included how dialectical thinking was absolutely actually applied in life and in
different disciplines and then we tried to develop some chapters on how dialectical thinking develops
in human beings and we thought we'd finish off with a dialectical discussion between the authors
based on the idea of is dialectic really the antidote dogma or not
so that's the overall structure we started with the introduction we're just trying to lay the groundwork for
what follows in the book and then a series of chapters on origins of the theories starting with a whole overview of how dialectic developed from antiquity to the present day
and then a couple of chapters on from the russian perspective particularly how dialectical thinking has developed in russia and the sort of problems that it's encountered along the way
and then we have two very core chapters dialectical thinking and structural dialectical analysis which i will call the russian line of dialectical thinking
uh and then secondly we have dialectical thinking as a post-formal organization apologies for the spelling there of human thought and action uh i'll call that the neo-piegettian line
nicolai varaksa wrote the dialectical thinking and uh michael bascas wrote the following chapter
we then have a chapter on internal relations and dialectics
internal relations and dialectics probably the most uh oriented towards hegel of all the chapters
so getting into philosophical origins there
but we thought we needed to pick up also the work by paying and nisbet particularly on chinese dialectical thinking or
east asian dialectical thinking sometimes referred to as naive naive dialectical thinking
um and uh mike muskola wrote the chapter on harmonizing opposites and then finally we finished
off with a chapter by david hoe dialectical thinking is the pinnacle of human intellect
and then we moved swiftly into applications we've got a chapter by harry proctor uh talking about the contributions of charles pierce and george kelly to dialectical thinking
and harry is really a family um therapist
so he's supplying family systems theories in working with families
and thought that uh the work of charles pierce and george kelly could contribute in that way
then they have bruno's chapter on ethics and dialectical thinking
the model for resolving value conflicts that's bruno fisher's uh dialectics and myth
um chapter by nina bagdasarova where she um spans on how myth contains four different kinds of thinking
one of which is dialectical thinking
we then move back into the scientific world with a chapter on non-linear quantum quantum physics by
shows a croca professor of physics uh in lisbon
and a chapter on mathematics and dialectic
um from a russian author
sergey zeladeev and then finally yana yua has produced a chapter on transdisciplinary
transdisciplinary complexity thinking and dialectics where she tries to show how dialectics is important
in bringing different disciplines in science together and how that compares with complexity thinking
we then move to applications of dialectics in real life my own chapter on how dialectical thinking
can help resolve paradoxes for individuals and uh organizations uh we have a chapter on dialectics in
organizational consulting um we have a chapter on dbt dialectical behavior therapy using dialectics to
treat people who are suicidal and a chapter on uh international relations uh again by shannon brinkat
and then finally we have michael mascotto talking about how you can bridge political divides through
dialectical problem solving
then we move on almost finally to how dialectical thinking develops
firstly in preschoolers uh and then in uh late teenagers in terms of creativity
and then how you assess dialectical thinking in children looking at the russian work in particular
they're there training adults in dialectical thinking including the work of uh lottero um
otolasky uh and then we have a neurobiological model of dialectical thinking
just exploring the way that the brain develops different networks and how those interact
uh very complicated chapter that probably the most difficult chapter in the whole book
and then finally a chapter written by michael mascotto and myself
on how we can bring together the two different models of dialectical thinking
so finally we finish off with a dialectical discussion i won't be saying too much about that today
leave that as a surprise for you so just say a little bit about the um introductory chapter
um it's fronted by this artwork by lars uh which he calls confluence and you can see there that confluence is a merge
a merge a merger of all different elements different uh color squares different passages of light
and he's trying to illustrate in an artwork a level of integration there
in the chapter itself we lay out these three lines of research uh the neo-pegettian line um
following the work of michael basicus and obviously taken out by otolasky inspired by claus regal in the us
uh and then we compare that with rax's um neo-pegettian line focus on thinking with opposites and his work with children
and then thirdly the cultural differences line which was pursued by peng and nisbet
and i think there that what happened was that peng was studying under nisbet at university
and uh in their conversations they realized they thought in slightly different ways and
peng with his um chinese heritage uh explained that chinese didn't always think the way that americans
uh thought to this bit so they decided to research that
so these are three very different approaches all tackling a common theme
basicus as you're probably most familiar with uh using um schemata as examples and expressions of
dialectical thinking uh following a system of or a family of different world views
and then for access work looking particularly at the way that children
can respond to or are sensitive or perhaps even insensitive to opposites and contradictions
and then peng and nisbet's work setting out the differences and attitudes values and beliefs in
relation to contradiction that are between us and chinese populations
so one of the points that we try to make in the chapter is that all of these research methodologies
suffer from some weaknesses and possibly the biggest weakness of them all is that in a way the scientific
paradigm that they use is not really a developmental uh perspective
it's more of a kind of linear and somewhat static statistical uh perspective as falsender says how can one
study development with methods based on a non-developmental perspective
so finally we talk a little bit about the power of dialectical thinking and there are four themes that
uh mike muskola brings out there firstly it's an antidote to dogma because it treats opposition
contradiction and conflict as an opportunity for development and secondly it can be used as a
cornerstone of scientific methodology scientists must seek out evidence
dialectically that both confirms and conflicts or disconfirms their existing theories
and they have to understand and study the underlying values assumptions
that lay behind their theory making
the third way of thinking about the power of dialectical thinking is as a means to address
moral social political issues in society
and finally it's a way to solve wicked problems
so that is just a brief summary of all the points that we try to make in the introduction
i'll now get into the detail of some of these chapters
firstly an artwork by lars
here he brings the past into the present in terms of the pyramids of ancient egypt
overlaid on a more modern cityscape
um and in the foreground there's some very mundane things like a washing line and various tv aerials
and in the background there's some wonderful um architecture and styles
so it's a combination there of of opposites and bringing the past into the present
i said we start the book after the introduction with an introduction with uh really a summary of all
the different lines of dialectical thinking going back uh through the millennia really and mike
muskoda produced this uh very useful diagram which i think kind of shows pretty much where we are
today along the bottom line um using dialectical thinking in different disciplines um thinking
about dialectic as a developmental process um studying how dialectical thinking itself develops
using it in psychotherapy and thinking of it as something that underlies differences in
in different cultures and um their thinking
so that rather nicely i think traces out how we've got to where we are today
and of course there are some people uh missing from that um i think uh aquinas is there yes uh nicholas
kuzas is not there but uh he's covered the ground pretty thoroughly in that chapter
then we move on to uh the russian uh development of thinking and of course russia has a very rich
tradition starting off with 19th century philosophical salons um father of russian marxism
lord leganov um alexis losev who wrote about the unity and struggle of opposites
pavel kopin who came up with the idea that dialectical thinking is a different kind of thinking
to formal logical thinking and elienkov who tried to formalize dialectic logic i think eventually gave up
and nikolai um frakza contrasts that history with the work of bigotsky probably the most uh familiar
russian psychologist to you all um and he analyzes bigotsky's thinking um and picks out various different
forms of dialectic forms of dialectic that bigotsky used bigotsky clearly thought that dialectic thinking
was fundamental for science and clearly the mind in society is one way that he expressed that theme
if evgeny kashenkov uh talks about historical problems that have faced um principally um
i guess medieval and subsequently some russian philosophers thinking about dialectic
dialectic uh he says there's five fundamental questions that dialectical philosophers and theorists
have tried to try to resolve
how should dialectic be understood in itself is it a method of proving things or simply a method of
persuading people where is the truth in dialectic is the question that he's asking there
and then he asks is it a way of knowing reality or simply a way of describing it perhaps bringing
out the ontological versus epistemological arguments
and then is dialectic a way of simply going around in circles talking about things in a different way
or is it really a process of generating new ideas
and finally is it something that we just do in our heads or is it really a reflection of real life
so he comes up with a very broad conclusion dialectic is a logic of thought a logic of being
and a logic of reality i thought that was a wonderful triadic way to express dialectic
now we get on to a more detailed analysis of uh the russian research that's taken place
really over the last 20 30 years and as i said earlier on working principally with children
and this i think you'll probably be least familiar with
but nicolai viraxa and his team have developed this concept of dialectic which is taken taken up
strongly in several chapters in the book and he talks in one of his early papers about five dialectical
structures it's not entirely clear to me that these are structures rather than processes
but he talks about a straight move from an a to a b being as a transformation
and then he talks about the ability of somebody to identify in a single object
different characteristics that are in opposition to each other and he calls that mediation i'll give
you some examples of how he tests that later on he talks about integration as almost the opposite of
mediation where somebody sees a particular object and then identifies that it has two opposing properties
within it fourth form of dialectical thinking for him is what he calls seriation which the movement from a to b
through some intermediate characteristic a b in this case and then the reverse of seriation inversion
where we move back from b to a so those are his five elementary structures and there's a couple more that we'll talk about a little bit later on
that's a little bit later on
nicolai illustrates these uh with a very simple diagram you think about the transformation of winter into summer
that's a to b
and similarly if you think about autumn going into spring that's another transformation a to b
but of course winter goes through spring into summer and the summer goes through autumn into winter
so you have these links as well you have seriation there as well
and now of course we turn to michael basker's seminal work on dialectical thinking
position it very clearly as post-formal making use of both
logical or formal operational thinking which he refers to as closed system analysis and being able
to articulate and transcend the limits of those analysis with open system thinking
so he defines dialectic as developmental transformation which occurs via constitutive and interactive relationships
and dialectical thinking and dialectical thinking he conceptualizes in terms of this
series or family of philosophical world views which transcend formal thinking
but have some kind of resemblance between them that one can recognize
and he operationalize these as a series of thought schemata which otolasky then built um developed
by adding one or two into 28 thought forms which i'm sure you're all familiar with by now
so we have an interesting tension really on the one hand between
almost the pre-formal idea of dialectic coming from vratza and the post-formal idea of dialectic
coming from michael basicus and a challenge for us really in the book was to do the dialectical
integration of those two ideas
so let's move perhaps into a little bit more of a philosophical or theoretical view of dialectic
tom vidale who incidentally worked with fisher on dynamic skill theory
has studied hegel in some depth and he asked well what is the essential nature of dialectics
and he says it's really about the inter-participation of different parts
self-movement of parts and wholes and the process of half haven
the inter-participation well what does he mean by that he means that in dialectics the essential part
is the inter-relationship the inter-relationship of internal parts that make up a whole
and he says for example if you think about some forms of psychotherapy
what takes place there is an interaction between the person and the environment they're in
and the one influences the other and the other influences the one and this is of course very
similar to vogotsky's idea the mind and society
and then he refers to hegel's notion of our haven the idea that dialectic is more than a simple
comparison of thesis and antithesis resulting in a synthesis but it's a kind of lifting up both
preservative and negation of the components that are finally integrated
and an example of that i think is in this last statement in our efforts to become more diverse
we soon realized that we would also have to become more inclusive lest our diverse people became siloed
so now we've had to rethink how we can instill a culture that embraces diversity and establishes
common ground between its members and this is very much where the uk is right now in terms of its
integration policy we've welcomed diversity but we haven't yet found a way to integrate that diversity
we're moving now into mike muskola's work on chinese dialectical thinking and michael here criticizes
the paganism view of chinese dialectical thinking being naive in any sense points out that chinese
dialectical thinking is much more than the toleration of opposites might be true to say that paganism's view
is that the difference between chinese and american is that when americans encounter opposites
they want to kind of reconcile and either one cancels the other or there is some kind of synthesis there
whereas the chinese are just happy to tolerate and let the let the opposites be
but mike points out that harmony is a fundamental theme in chinese dialectical thinking
both in the harmony between opposites and yin and yang uh the way that chinese characters
are put together um the way they talk about the crest of the trough uh of a wave
and the way that they compare figure and ground and he says this harmony theme shows up again
in in the idea of chinese medicine where all living systems are considered as holes and um that the
parts of the the whole need to be in harmony for health to occur and of course when the
symptoms arise when there isn't a harmony between these various parts
so a very uh detailed study there on chinese dialectical thinking
and then uh a section on uh dialectical thinking as the pinnacle of human intellect
and david hoe uh contrasts uh perhaps mike muskos and peng's and nisbet's views by saying that actually
dialectical thinking in the east and the west is not actually so different it has five fundamental
characteristics it's metacognitive so it's thinking about thinking it represents the pinnacle of human
cognition it's right at the top there that it's metasystematic that it transcends cultural differences
and it plays a part in therapeutic movement that its value is in helping people become i guess um
mentally perhaps stronger perhaps fitter perhaps healthier
now we move on to applications
starting with lars's uh picture conquest of the morning after the rain a number of structures there
some are finished some are unfinished some are under repair and what lars is doing here is again
combining different opposites in his composition and this is really a kind of way of of reflecting on
unfinished work i think all of the dialectical applications that we're going to talk about
are unfinished work
firstly harry proctor talks about the role of dialectical constructivism
he makes various points drawing on the work of charles pierce and george kelly starting with kelly
points out that the meaning of language arises out of polarities you can't really talk about north
without there being a south there'd be no meaning there and this is fundamental when you want to
understand how different people and families who are in conflict draw different meanings from the same language
and he also makes the point that george kelly pointed george penny referred to that something goes on in the
human mind when they make a comparison between a and b that is in fact quite dialectical in the sense
that first they need to distinguish a and b but also they need to distinguish them to link them and this
happens in a single act
harry argues that synthesis is not necessary for a conception of dialectic
and he also argues that conflict between opposites is not really fundamental either
he argues that it's inferior to the process of negotiation and arbitration
something i think that bruno takes up as well in his chapter on ethics
harry refers to pierce's concept of three categories
what he calls firstness which is thinking about things in themselves
secondness thinking about something in relation to its other joining up with kelly there and thirdness
the act of applying meaning to something such as the significance of a particular sign
and so harry concludes that if you're going to intervene in families and organizations
to resolve tensions and disputes you need to look at the dialectic underlying the way people construct
their positions and attribute meaning to them and explore that and unfold that in dialogue
so now we come to bruno's chapter and bruno sets out here a process really for analyzing and resolving
conflicts with organizations based on the assessment of values
it's basically a five-step process going from identifying values analyzing them bringing them together
implementing them and then reflecting on them and he refers to the dialectical thinking cycle
which he and i wrote about in our book meta thinking
bruno's point is that people come into conflict when they have to i guess try and preserve or realize
different values um which are in some way opposition to each other so in analyzing those values
and bringing out what those values mean where they belong to and using wilbur's integral model there
one could explore the values in detail and see if there might be a way in which they can be
matched or harmonized or brought together and bruno proposes dialogue using mind opening questions
from the four dialectical quadrants structural process relationship and transformation to help people
negotiate and integrate their different value systems
now we move to something quite different and this is the presence of dialectical thinking
in historical myths this chapter by nina baghdad sarova uh where she talks about four different kinds of
thinking gives an example of an irish myth called the wooing of attain and nina argues that in these
myths you can see four different types of thinking you can see a kind of logic of everyday experience
just simply how we recognize things in the world and you can see evidence of induction and
deduction the kind of formal processes of logic but more than that you can see dialectical logic
largely in terms of the way different characters in the myth take on different roles
uh display different personalities transform from one form to another uh kind of frogs into prince's way
and she says finally there is a narrative logic in the whole uh idea of myth and so she brings out
um the wisdom of these myths by showing that uh the ancient people who developed these myths had
all these different ways of thinking even though we sometimes think that our formal logical processes
or our dialectical thinking are sophisticated things that we've only just invented
and we move from myth into the land of uh the physicist with jose's crocus a chapter he's a professor of physics
uh i think at lisbon and he points to a dialectic that occurred between the classical or newtonian view of physics
and quantum mechanics expressed by the idea that uh light and uh quantum particles seem to
have the characteristics of being both particles and waves and he said that what happened was really
a crisis in physics because the explanations for how uh light and quantum particles had these characteristics
yielded paradoxes um such as that of schrodinger's cat
not knowing whether it was alive or dead until um the experimenter opened the cage
and he points to the fact that there seemed to be a contradiction in physicist's thinking
uh on the one hand they breathe believed the principle of locality i.e that you could identify and predict
the location of any kind of quantum particle and on the other they also believed in the idea of
non-locality that it was impossible to predict uh with any certainty where these particles were
and he suggested that in order to reconcile these two views you needed to have a middle way
she calls causal non-linear quantum physics
now that's a kind of pretty technical um uh chapter and i have to say that
um much of the physics is beyond me um but you'll get the idea that dialectics is present
dialectical thinking is present in the thinking of uh sophisticated physicists like chose
we follow that up with sergey's as a day of chapter on um mathematics and dialectic
and he asked the question what exactly where exactly is dialectic hiding within mathematics
so sergey built the mathematical and graphical models that underlie nikolai for access conception of
dialectical thinking and a little example is there shown in the diagram at the bottom of the page
which i'll try and explain to you now sergey's idea is this is that a child is out one day shopping with
his parents and he sees um two toys which he would like to have so he says his parents you know please
please i must have one of those toys and the parents have a choice in the first instance should i should
they buy them toy a or toy b but then beyond that there are other choices as well because they could buy
both toys a and b or they could choose neither toy
and then there's a third level of choice because they could say oh well why don't we just take you
to a games tour where you can try playing with both of those toys or perhaps you won't do that at all
we'll take you to a sporting event as a treat instead
so basically what sergey is pointing to here is by mapping out these opposites one can creatively devise
even further combinations and additional choices in a dialectical fashion
now we move back into um a little bit of theory really uh your's chapter talks about how dialectics is
important if we are to develop science beyond its siloed
aspect at the moment it's compartmentalized aspect and how we can develop an interdisciplinary science
she points to something that she calls the tps
paradigm
struggling now to remember exactly what tps stands for but you have to forgive me for that
but she says that tps as tps refers to different layers of reality
non-binary non-binary logic complexity thinking
and how the inquirer should be integrated with the process of inquiring
so a very dialectical view of the way that science could develop further
between across and beyond disciplines
where i'm coming from is that dialectical thinking is a great way to resolve the kind of paradoxes and
organizations and i refer to three paradoxes the paradoxes of human nature you might think of
um a recent case with a chap called sam bankman fried um who one point i think had a fortune of 26
billion and he lost 25 billion of it in a few hours one day um went from some kind of hero of the
the uh cryptocurrency world uh to some kind of villain of the cryptocurrency world
and now is uh facing a very significant jail sentence
and then there's paradoxes of strategy where
we try to do we try to follow a particular strategy but something goes completely wrong
that we hadn't expected and then there's paradoxes of unintended consequences
where again we try and take an action uh but almost the opposite happens that we're respecting from that
action so i like to show that dialectical thinking is the way that we can unlock and resolve these paradoxes
simply because structural thinking seeing the bigger picture can help you locate
the paradox in the different contexts in which it might occur
and how process thinking that indicates constant change will show that these things are never
never static things are always moving and that's how paradoxes may arise
and relational thinking is the thing that links different paradoxical outcomes together so there's a
connection between both being a good guy or a bad guy and scaling up a business strategy and having your
profitability collapse and then transformational thinking which sees paradoxes as things that either
develop or regress the organizational status
and then transformational thinking which sees paradoxes as things that are happening in a way that
we follow on from that with uh russian contribution from sergey's chevalukin uh where he talks about
three case studies that he's used within organizations to develop strategic options
uh and uh he uses the uh strategic uh sorry the structural dialectical analysis model that nikolai and uh the other sergey
developed so good um the example that he gives here he's talking about um companies that uh sell
telecommunications systems uh internet and mobile phones and how they present these to
uh their customers and he says they start from two positions one might be to attract customers
and the other might be to maximize profit and when they think about those they say well one way of doing
both of those might be to make very difficult to um compare value and another way might be to make it very difficult to uh compare price
and then he moves from there to say that if you wanted to make it impossible to compare value and impossible to compare price
you might do that through a very sophisticated new billing method and uh converging services saying bundle services together
so basically he's building on the idea of opposites combining them together and splitting them apart
to create new options for business strategy
so then we move to dialectical behavior therapy this is a chapter by mckenna swales who is a professor of uh
bangun university in the uk um principally studying dialectical behavior therapy
and she points to the dialectical aspect of dbt that the idea that dbt
works because it focuses on both acceptance and change rather than one or the other
that it doesn't purport to hold out a single version of the truth but says simply that there could be
different perspectives that are used to define different realities there's the therapist's truth and
there's the client's truth that no one person has the answer and therefore the therapist must use their
team to tease out opposing views um that it's important rather than trying to find the truth
for people simply to see if there is some way of combining different polarities the therapist must always
consider what might be missing from their diagnosis the therapist must also consider that everything is connected
and the therapist can play a part in being the devil's advocate allowing an antithesis to emerge
in relation to whatever the client offers them
well it was principally michael's michael bassiger's idea to call it a handbook so i wouldn't um i won't say
it was mine uh but we did start with the intention of collecting as much information as we could
about dialectical thinking so that somebody who was interested in researching dialectical thinking
could so go somewhere and find out uh as as much as there was to know about it that was that was
the real intention but of course that's just a mammoth task and in the end you have to you have to um
um an interesting idea of uh of how you do this process but at the end you have to assemble a bunch
of authors and see you can get to write what and then you've got to get them to write it and then
having gotten to write it you then read it and figure out is that what you thought they were going
to write or have they written something completely different so so you end up with with what you end
up with at the end of the day i think it's an interesting collection but it's probably as you
as you suggest it's it's not the ultimate in handbooks and if there ever could be such a thing for
such a thing for dialectical thinking it's a starting point i think what i'm what i want to say is a
historical remark that is also a philosophical remark i think what hasn't been seen in my work
um is that i have opened up a what i would call the bascarian line of dialectic and that bascarian line
is in opposition to the piagetian line um in that my um michael basich is um
no i mean robeska is saying you can't really talk about dialectic
if you presuppose the the human thinker the human thinker is a constituted being
that emerges from a dialectically constructed or structured world
and if you cannot account for the dialectical nature of the thinker
which is an ontological issue
how can you think cogently about dialectical thinking as a kind of
the entity you know it so to in my view and i agree that i have not fully
worked that out in my writing but i'm coming more and more to that conclusion
which ultimately leads me to uh gilbert simondon who calls dialectic transduction
my point here is to make it short that
dialectical thinking is not something
that emerges that emerges that is just there but it is a characteristic of the human being
and this human being is constituted by
you might say reality or being which itself has a dialectical nature
and so i think the issue i have opened up in my work which hasn't been seen
is the relationship between
michael basich's work and roy basco's work
or you could say
could say it differently
the relationship
in dialectic between ontology and epistemology
so what i've heard you say nick is all about epistemology there is no connection to ontology
and that's all i want to say i mean i'm not critiquing anything or complaining
i myself have always struggled with this issue of ontology how is ontology related to epistemology
that would be my comment oh thank you otto and i think it is a valid criticism that um we haven't
said much about basker in this book in fact we we paid passing action to him um and i think part of
that is that how are we as psychologists not philosophers yeah and being psychologists we find it hard
really to adopt an ontological standpoint for us everything is filtered through epistemology
yeah and we need also to think about what's practical in terms of research that could be brought to bear
and i find
basker's ideas powerful as they are something that's almost beyond any form of research that i'm aware of
yeah thank you i would hope nick that these issues that i
i referred to would not be forgotten
yes well hopefully um we start a discussion going uh and inevitably there's things that are missing from
this book um but when it's out there that will be the time i think to start bringing these
other things in uh yeah perhaps
thank you for your very rich presentation
shannon bricca um shannon's an academic uh in uh brisbane in australia and he writes about international
relations particularly from perspective that underpinning contemporary thinking international relations
is full of what he calls metaphysical assumptions unchallenged assumptions for example that
humans are solely focused on getting ahead as opposed to getting along
and therefore international relations take the form of the domination of one power over another
and this is a kind of hobbesian view that there's a state of nature exists at all times
and that a higher power is required in order to establish order in the world
and shannon argues quite powerfully i think if more dialectical thinking was introduced in international
relationships international relations then this idea of uh the state of nature uh the need for a higher
power uh the need for dominance of one nation over another might be challenged more frequently
so uh he writes quite cautiously about hegel uh he talks about the dogs of war and the clouds of dogma
that are pervading uh our world today and suggests that dialectical thinking might help resolve some of these
difficulties okay oh i forgot mike muskola's chapter um yeah i just said a little bit about this because
i want to get into uh development of dialectical thinking um so michael sets out what he calls a
process of dialectical engagement on the one hand he calls it collaborative problem solving and the
other he talks about dialectical problem solving and he makes a distinction between these two
that the collaborative problem solving is one of simply kind of identifying needs on both sides
examining interests and concerns and finding ways to meet both of those
the dialectical problems but dialectical problem solving goes further because it involves creating shared
beliefs finding common ground rather than common compromise and he talks about how he has a process
of facilitating discussion groups where by a process of inquiry he encourages people to identify and
understand the kernel of truth in the opposite person's thinking or the thinking that is opposite to their own
and therefore to adjust their own ideologies and create shared beliefs and in the chapter he details
uh the work that he did over a number of weeks with a particular group they debated school uniforms they
debated capital punishment and they debated race relations and they were a deeply divided group but they
managed to find some common ground through this process so very practical chapter there
so finally on to the development of dialectical thinking
um little artwork by last uh he calls it harmonies um notice there that there's groups of three i think picking up the
thesis antithesis synthesis motive but also the kind of joy of play and development
um so a chapter by uh the shians olga and igor shian uh talking about the uh dialectical thinking of preschoolers
this is children four five and six principally uh before school and picking up on a comment by regal
that you can achieve dialectical maturity without necessarily passing through formal or even concrete operations
well what the shians have done is looked at the way children are sensitive or not to opposites
and clearly what they find is that uh children seem to be less worried about combining opposites uh than adults
and certainly that they are when they go to school and get taught more in terms of formal operations
so children's fairy tales are full of things like frogs being turned into princes
and they ask children questions like what might it be like for a person to be moving or not moving at the same time
and they see how the children answer
and they talk about uh different perspectives so they ask children about a picture of the kremlin
and say is that old or is it new and one child said to them well it was new once but it's old now so
it seems that children have a way of picking up these dialectical themes
certainly in play dialectic plays a very strong role because your child will
play with its doll for example and a child may feed its doll and it knows that it's dull it's not
actually going to eat the food but at the same time it's a very real process of feeding the child
so things are both real and imaginary and they're somehow integrating those two ideas
and finally they finish off with talking about their transformations program where um again in
facilitated classroom discussions or other priests pre preschool discussions i should say
they spend their time uh asking children these questions and capturing their reactions
which are often very dialectical what the shans are trying to promote i believe is the idea that school
education very often has a negative impact on children's creativity because it tries to nullify dialectical thinking
so now we have quite a complicated chapter on dialectical thinking and creativity
and anastasia belavitskaya has spent quite a lot of time with students giving them an exercise she calls
heroes in the city which simulates a messy problem
and that they have to find some resolution between the opposite agendas of different characters
in a complex situation
and she comes to the conclusion that creativity has strong element of dialectical thinking but clearly is not
just dialectical thinking it involves formal thinking imagination and dialectical thinking as well
then we have some um seminal experience by nikolai fraksa and igor shian firstly there's an experiment
where they presented children a group of children with a block that was weighted
and uh when the weight when the block was was was put on the edge of the table
because it was weighted uh inside with a heavy weight uh it was supported initially by the hand of the
the uh teacher and the teacher asked the question is it going to fall or not
and uh it looked like it was leaning well over the edge uh so the center of gravity would clearly tip
it over but it stayed in place
and that was because the weight was in there and then without chandra noticing
the teacher would allow the weight to shift and ask the question again will it fall or not they said
well it didn't fall last time so it won't fall again and then he took his hand away and it fell
so they were presented with the idea that this block had different characteristics that it could both fall
and not fall and they had to somehow resolve that in their mind and what they found was that children
different ages dealt with this in very different ways as you can imagine
but some children up to the age of about seven were able to figure out that it was perfectly
possible for the block to have these different characteristics because there was
a trick inside in terms of the weight that could be moved across from one end to the other
and they uh invited uh children to identify sequences uh they showed them the image on the right
glass of water uh something in between and then a glass of water with four sugar lumps
and they gave the children a choice which of the two lower pictures would fit in that description that
that pattern better with the idea that the sequence should really be uh empty glass a glass with two
sugar lumps and a glass with four sugar lumps rather than an empty glass glass with one sugar lump and then
four sugar lumps they consider that to be an instance of seriation the idea of a dialectical process from a to b
and then similar they ask questions what could be at the same time black and white
i have not alive light and heavy the same and different so there they're asking children to
think of an object which could combine opposite characteristics
and then they came up with another couple of what they saw as dialectical acts in children
using picture stories and on the top there you have pinocchio fishing and uh during the day and then the sun goes down and
pinocchio packs up and goes to bed and the second picture they have uh pinocchio in bed and then uh goes out fishing and the sun rises
and uh he's there fishing uh later on in the day and the children were asked to kind of compare these two pictures
and see if they could come up with explanation on really why they were different or could they come
up with a story that explained the uh pattern from left to right in both pictures and of course for some
children it's very difficult because they saw the middle of the picture being the same but others were able to see that
in one picture one version the sun was setting and in the other the sun was rising
fortunately didn't get into complications about whether the sun was rising in the east and setting
in the west or doing both and then at the bottom uh there's a a nice little story about a prince who's
given a task if he wants to marry the maiden of uh retrieving a trunk which is hanging in a tree in a far
off land and when he gets to the tree uh he finds out that his ladder's not high enough to get the trunk
down so what what do the children think he could do and some of them were able to think in terms of
changing the alternative i.e if the ladder's not long enough forget about the ladder maybe cut down the tree instead
then we move on just a little bit of a comparison of different methods of training adults in dialectical thinking
um the sheeans have quite a detailed explanation of what they call the positional method which involves
giving groups of students scientific text and then inviting them to consider the text from a whole
variety of different positions those positions are specially selected uh so that they contrast compare and
sometimes conflict with other positions but in that way they encourage uh the students to think from
a variety of different perspectives rather than certainly to think of the scientific text from the
point of view of the teacher and then there's uh anastasia beneskaia's um exercise the opportunities for
heroes where she gives people the scenario and also to come up with a creative solution
there's the meta thinking um techniques that bruno and i set out in meta thinking using different ways
to learn thinking modes the thought forms associated with those thinking modes and then there's also what
i call kind of semi dialectical trading methods there's work on polarities by barry johnson there's the
approach that dbt takes there's integrative thinking and both and thinking which all of which are helping
people see both sides of the coin so we go into kind of explaining a little bit about all of those methods
and finally point out that although there's plenty of kind of enablers now to help people think
dialectically we don't know too much about what are the constraints what prevents people from becoming
dialectical thinkers especially given the fact that children seem to have the ability to think
dialectically neurobiology uh this is probably the most difficult chapter in the whole book
and it's written by angela brown dow and mike muscolo and what they try to do is to identify
how brain development may somehow impact dialectical thinking i'm not going to say anything more about it
because it's beyond me
i will say a little bit though about uh mike muscolo and my attempt to try and find a way to integrate
phraxis and basicus models and we use we do that using fisher's dynamical dynamic skill theory
in order to provide a some kind of framework and if you're not familiar with uh fisher's theory i think
uh now otto is uh so he used it in um uh measuring in uh dimensions volume two um but basically um
um fisher sets out a hierarchy of skills uh moving from well age two making representations of things
uh comparing those representations he calls the mapping making a system of those representations and then
finally making a system of all of those systems which connects with the next level of
skill a single set of abstractions mapping those abstract abstractions putting a system together
and making a system of those systems so uh that is the uh modeled lexica um was it lectica have made
uh their uh assessments out of and how does uh vrax's model uh fit into that and how would
uh basca's and ask his model fit into that well you might consider the question what can be both big
and small when answered by a child who says well a baby elephant is big and small as a level two
uh representation just putting those two things together uh developing a new structure
and on the level of abstractions
um an answer that a particular business model could be both profitable and sustainable
could be an example of the skill at ab and level ab2 um mapping different abstractions
so the conclusion that we come to there's obviously more detail in the chapter
is that somehow these structures of dialectical thinking
and we have to think of structures as not just structures but as processes as well
somehow participate in developing higher level
forms of dialectical thinking but the same patterns exist at different levels
throughout it's kind of a fractal organization
all right i shall stop there i think with an image from lars of the new world which she based largely
on the map of monday um which is a tapestry in i think hereford cathedral and then combine that with
various different images bringing in the past into the present
and thinking about the future wonderful nick thank you so much
it feels a bit like going to a restaurant and having the way to explain the menu for an hour and i
get such i'm getting really hungry and then the waiter says oh by the way we are closing
uh my question is do you have a proposal how to continue from here because i don't assume that
we will have another discussion for an hour or so um no i mean my hope really was just to give you a
flavor for what's in the book today and i hope i managed to do that um and i'm sorry for all the heavy
content um there's a lot in the book um so my hope going forward is that we can get individual authors
to talk about their chapters and so if any of you are interested in particular chapters
and you'd like to email me um then please go ahead uh because uh then i can say there's an audience for
a particular chapter and i'm sure that the author would would come forward be delighted to give you
a explanation i know that the artist lars who hasn't written in a chapter but who's clearly a very
dialectical thinker would love to talk about some of his work uh so i'm kind of planning planning that i
think bruno might be tempted uh to talk a little bit about his chapter uh i'm sure michael basicus
will talk a bit about his and perhaps some of the russians as well thank you so much nick for your
time for your energy uh we really appreciate what you have been doing not just this evening but really
for the last few years so many many people will be very grateful for what you and your team have
been putting together here thank you so much thank you everybody see you next time
