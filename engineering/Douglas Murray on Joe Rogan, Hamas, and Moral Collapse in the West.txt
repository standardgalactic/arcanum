Douglas Murray welcome to honestly great pleasure to be with you so Douglas we're sitting here and
we are right on the cusp of the big 100 day mark of the second Trump presidency and I'd be remiss
if I didn't ask you to help us make sense of it how's he doing what grade would you give him
um well I'm slightly allergic to 100 days style things like a very American thing well no it's
like anniversaries you know when we're doing this because it's the 243rd anniversary um but no it is
it is of course a milestone of a kind um well they've certainly been treating it as one meaning
they want to get as much done in the 100 days and there's been I think more executive orders than
just any president perhaps since FDR yes uh which is an interesting way of doing things and is
something that you could see coming Trump had said this was gonna how he's gonna do things I think
for me the interesting thing is always a comparison with Trump one um you know Trump one was uh frankly
a mess uh people were in positions who the president didn't seem to you know know or rate and then he
had to give them the heave-ho and replace him with other people and this time around he's had four
years to prepare for this obviously he was preparing for it very seriously he knew he want who he wanted
to surround himself with he knew he wanted loyalists crucially uh Trump loyalists and that's what he's
done I just said that uh the fact that there has been so little um pandemonium is just worth
voting uh some people might think there has been but really I mean it's nothing nothing like it was
uh it's been pretty orderly uh it's been concerted there have been things that the president has done
which seem to have amazed people like tariffs most obviously which I cannot understand why people are
amazed by because all he did was talk about how he was yes I mean every time I covered a rally uh you
know it's like tariffs were one of the big things he talked about I don't know whether much of the
commentariat classes simply got used to politicians saying they do something and they're not doing it
uh and they're kind of shocked that he's actually doing the things he said he'd do but but he is
um I mean there's only been one major misstep which was the the signal leap a leak and that wasn't
um compared to some things that have happened in recent years that you know that story's now blown
over um to my mind domestically he's done several of the biggest things he said he'd do he has uh
stopped almost entirely the illegal movement of the southern border which is one of the things he was
voted in on doing he has been uh deporting illegal foreign criminals that's one of the things he said he'd
do um tariffs of course then on the broader foreign affairs beat which is what I'm sort of in some
ways most interested in at the moment it's a mixed bag um his appointment of Steve Wyckoff as the
envoy to end all wars is um it's it's it's it's an audacious appointment to give any man I think
uh I mean I don't think there's a man or a woman on the on the universe who could deal with this
number of briefs that Wyckoff is having to deal with but what I find interesting and sometimes
concerning is the extent to which uh already Trump's promises on some of the foreign affairs stuff have
clearly not been able to be implemented in the way that he promised that they would some people will
say well I mean it was obviously just campaign rhetoric to say you know I'm going to stop X war on day
one like the Russia Ukraine war nevertheless he did say it and uh you know 100 days in the war is still
grinding on there uh there are still hostages in Gaza uh including an American born hostage uh the war is
going on going on there the nuclear talks with Iran uh look like seeping into JCPOA 0.2 um Obama's nuclear
deal the Obama nuclear deal um and so on that it's it's um on the domestic stuff I'd say a high score
on the foreign affairs stuff it's a little early to tell but it's concerning give us a little bit more
of a sense let's just stay on the foreign affairs subject for a second we have run a lot of pieces
in the free press explaining the sort of and I'll be crude about it the two broad camps uh that are
inside the Trump administration on that issue um in on certain issues certain domestic issues I think
the administration speaks with a pretty united voice but when it comes to foreign policy and the
question of muscular foreign policy or pulling back from the world there's let's say a cacophonous debate
and I would say on one side there's Mike Waltz former Green Beret um he's the one who is I would
say of anyone in the administration speaking up most strongly for a kind of stronger hand um and then
you have others in the administration and this is one of the things you saw in that signal uh leak
that was fascinating you have JD Vance and others sort of caucusing with the they've rebranded themselves
as restrainers who's winning in that fight between the restrainers and I guess let's say the Hawks
uh it's a little early to say um and it seems to go back and forth we should concede of course this
is a this is not only a a live debate but of course it's a it's a very serious one it's one of the most
serious divides going on within the Trump administration which is I would say not just between the the Hawks
and the sort of isolationist but it's it's it's it that's one way to think of it I mean it's also
between those people in the administration most obviously JD Vance who really do think that America
should withdraw from most of the world and focus its efforts on the only real economic competitor to
this country which is China um and then there are others who say you know well they address that
fundamental what I've said before is a fundamental problem at the heart of the MAGA uh isolationist
wing which is they simultaneously want America to be the world's dominant power but they don't want to
be involved in the world this is a very serious uh um problem that they at some point they will either
address or fail to address um you know in that signal chat we saw we saw the vice president saying
you didn't see why America had to keep open the world's water lanes for you know the Europeans
or whatever and uh there's a perfectly good argument to say and I've made it for many years now that the
Europeans should step up on defense spending but at the same time uh uh you know if if America and her
allies uh don't keep open the world's waterways you know uh the Chinese Communist Party would love to
the job and uh our friends in Taiwan would be one of the first to suffer from the the order that that
would have seen I should be ushered in um I I think one other thing so it was worth touching on on that
which is I think there has I think there is alarm from some people particularly American allies uh I
picked this up uh recently on visits abroad I think there is some alarm about the uh the simultaneous
um um soft softly softly shall we say in regard to Putin in particular um um tolerance of the of the
Kremlin actually um not following what the American president has said they should do like you know
saying you know they won't attack energy facilities and then promptly attacking them I think there's
a concern among America's allies and again I mean the isolationist types can either think this is
important or not and maybe they don't think it's important but that at the same time as the beating
up on actual the softness on the Kremlin and the Ayatollahs and Qatar um at the same time as what
some of us see is a needless antagonizing of old allies like obviously most
clearly Canada and then Denmark and um I think the Danes are slightly bemused by the fact that
um what seemed at first almost to be a sort of troll uh has become apparent policy and in the case
of Canada and they're going to the voting booths right now yeah an election that seemed like it was
a sure bet for Halev the conservative now swinging wildly in Mark Carney's direction and he's probably
going to run away with the results yes and I mean seeing Trump say you know I don't I don't care
um uh you know I don't care if Carney wins only the lefties are easier to deal with or um
that that has caused some ruptures and ructions elsewhere um so on some of that but and then on
that one of the interesting questions is simply you know who is in charge of of that policy because
um much of what is happening in Russia Ukraine and indeed the Middle East ought to be the brief of
um Marco Rubio and he's conspicuously not leading these things if I was Marco Rubio I'd be absolutely
furious that uh uh that Steve Whitcoff yeah has more authority than he see he seems to have yes and the
real problem on that those things by the way and you don't have to be some kind of hawk to think this is
the real problem on those things is that um Trump clearly you know his decision to appoint his his uh
son-in-law Jared Kushner to uh let's say similar role in the post 2016 period absolutely paid off
I mean it really worked and all the people who said oh my gosh I can't believe he's just got this
the son-in-law this is uh what does he know um what is the ultimate nepo baby position right and
he actually pulled off the Abraham he pulled off the Abraham Accords it's it was amazing and all
credit to him and his father-in-law for that but um this this decision to bring as it were another New
York real estate guy in as a result because it did work last time but this time it's it's it's a little
early I said this in the post the other day it's it's it's it's disturbing to see somebody learn on
the job when the job is this serious um and when Wyckoff said recently that he had found that Hamas
were not uh not entirely honest interlocutors in the negotiations some of us did have a rather
overwhelming feeling of it took you how long to work that out but you didn't go in knowing that
um settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war think about what it is to have a negotiator who whatever his
other virtues does not know any of the history of this conflict going into negotiations with
Vladimir Putin who has his own entirely different view of history going back of course a couple of
millennia um that's a problem it's a problem doing nuclear negotiations if you're just starting off from
here dealing with Tehran because they are they will be very very pleased to be dealing with somebody
who does not have their memory let me ask one question on Iran and then I want to talk about
Joe Rogan and then of course your book on Iran um of course Trump in his first administration scuttled
the JCPOA uh Iran's uh sorry Obama's nuclear deal um he called it a horrible deal Marco Rubio said
something similar now you know under the leadership of Steve Whitcoff um we ran a piece by Mike Duran
the other day talking about how Steve Whitcoff is driving the Trump administration on the road to
Obamaland and how strange that result is we have a president who loves a good deal loves deals hates
war really really hates war um how are you going to be judging whether or not first of all do you
think a deal is even possible maybe let's start there and second of all if a deal is possible how
should those of us watching this with a lot of concern judge whether or not it is indeed a good deal
um I'm actually not very uh positive about a deal um I think it's highly unlikely that America can get
the Ayatollahs to restrain themselves from enrichment it's their goal it's been their goal for decades
um now there is talk once again as in the Obama years about whether or not uh uh the Iranians could
have um uh nuclear energy for civilian energy purposes and I mean this is this is excruciating for some of
us because we watched this happen before whenever the Iranians go that way um you know then you start
to catch them out whoopsie it turned out that our civilian nuclear program our energy nuclear program
we just we're just looking into seeing whether or not we can put it on the top of a missile you know
to sort of exaggerate things but that's that's that's that's how they act how they behave there's a
you know there was something before just shortly before he died uh the late uh scholar of the Muslim
world Bernard Lewis at the age of 100 or so was asked by a friend of mine what one thing do you wish
that the West would know about the Islamic world that it doesn't he gave such a brilliant answer he said
um I wish they understood that we in the West thinking at longest four-year cycles I mean really
do we think in America about two-year electoral cycle or a hundred days as I began this conversation
a hundred days and he said I wish people realize that in the in the Muslim world a decade is the
smallest piece of time that people talk in so for the mullahs Wyckoff comes goes Obama comes Trump goes
and so on but the aim remains the same I think to my mind that the great challenge for Donald Trump is
I believe he has committed uh as he has said that that that Iran will not the Iranian revolutionary
government will not become a nuclear power on his watch for me the question is but what about after him
it is one thing to say that for the next three and a half years or three three years nine months
whatever they will not get a bomb that's good news as a start but the bigger thing is after Trump there
could be another Obama there could be another Biden there could be an AOC there could be anybody question
for me is uh is he able to make sure they never have the bomb and that will be one of the things that
his legacy will be based on not just if it happened on his watch I think he will not allow that but will
happen on any any future presidents watch because of things that happened during his time in office
um that's one of the things I'm watching out for so there's lots of ways to judge the first hundred
days of this administration we can look at tariffs we can look at the economy we can look at immigration
Trump's war against uh elite universities uh foreign politics which I'm sure you celebrate and on and on
but I think there's another more um harder to pin down way to think about the past 100 days and that
is culturally how things have shifted and some people have talked about this as the vibe shift there's
lots of ways to describe it broadly speaking I think we both know people who were not Republicans but
were so disgusted with the excesses of the illiberal left uh were so disgusted with the shutdown of free
thinking the censoriousness around covid origins lockdown the Hunter Biden laptop we could go on
and on and on and on Biden's mental acuity that they thought you know what even if I'm not voting for
him I'm happy this guy won or I'm going to hold my nose and vote for him because they need a corrective
here we are a hundred days later and one of the fastest shifts that I've ever seen culturally is the
shift from focusing on the excesses of the woke left which let's be honest that's how the free
US got its start to now this rising illiberalism coming out of the right what some people have
called the woke right but I'll just give a simple definition of it which is for the past decade or
so we have seen an illiberal left that defaces the statues of Churchill and calls him a racist and all
kinds of other things now we have a group on the right and they are increasing in prominence that says
that is defacing Churchill's memory and suggesting that he and not Adolf Hitler is the true villain of World
World War II I would love Douglas and and this is I think a way to start to talk about your
incredible interview with Joe Rogan and Dave Smith but before we get there I would love just your riff
on the so-called woke right how worried should we be about the illiberalism that's taking root not
necessarily in Washington yet but certainly in major precincts of the online space if culture if politics is
downstream of culture how worried should we be about a movement that's increasingly popular that is
revisionist in its view of our history and of our heroes well it's a little early to say I mean it I can
see absolutely how they could get more influence and it could be more dangerous and more unpleasant um at
the same time I can see how one could overstate it you know I mean um uh the president doesn't share the
views of some of the people who are rampaging around online uh about history or or the present um
so I it's it's a difficult time to predict it if if it isn't headed off and countered and argued against
then I can certainly say I'd see how it would grow what I think is happening by the way maybe this is
a useful way into it is what I think is happening is that um when people are part of a movement that
is reactionary they have a problem at the moment of victory which is what do you do now you've won I
mean your guy is in office I think that people give away a lot about what they really mean to do when
when they do what they do at the point of victory what did you want your victory for was it to was
it to own the libs or as you said in the recent piece you know cry harder libs isn't a policy uh that
was something you could treat yourself to maybe in the uh biding years but not not now this is too serious
what some people do do when they have a rather unformed philosophy which is is me being probably very snooty of
of course in saying that but I think you can't help your accent but I just think that if somebody has
a rather unformed philosophy one of the things you do and I mean people do this when they're very young
I think we probably all did this is you you look around for the stuff that was left behind to see if
some of it was stuff you shouldn't have left behind uh the left has done that for years and parts of it
have continued to celebrate you know Shea Guevara some of them you know you see young leftists looking
to see if they can do Maoism again or whatever and the cleverer ones realize no you know 70 million
people died and that's bad and you know so let's not try that again and um and some of the less
intelligent ones will fall into it and some of the ones who actually are malevolent and want to do bad
things will will do this exercise I think the part of the right that's been victorious is is weirdly
treating itself to a version of this game not only have we won but maybe we can look back and see why
we lost for so long and on the right that version is uh I suppose you get it in little bits of the
catholic right still online and off of sort of a Francoism uh admiration you can sort of you can sort of
play it that way and they do um but others are clearly trying again and this is a very interesting
explanation for this because they're basically trying a Buchananite Paulite right interpretation
of the last century Buchanan being Pat Buchanan the isolationist and and there's a reason for that
which is is for all sorts of reasons we can both go into and know very well um post-Iraq post-Afghanistan
uh essentially the republican party lost an entire generation or two of foreign policy experts
because they had been shown to be wrong or wrong in part or significantly wrong or wildly wrong
evilly wrong however you want to portray it but by the time of the trump era in 2015-16 nobody wanted to
hear again from the old guard now that what that means is you have this huge gap in young people
coming up because they don't want to hear from dick cheney i mean you know to put it at its most they
really they really don't want dick cheney to come out and tell them where they might be going wrong
and uh they wouldn't have wanted to have heard from donald rumsfeld when he was still alive or from you know any
number of other people we could name but that means that there's this vast land that needs to be
grabbed that people are wanting to grab and one of the things they seem to be wanting to grab is you
see go back earlier than that go back before that why did we get involved in world war ii we america we
got involved in world war ii and we shouldn't have done all this blood and treasure and maybe we could
have just allowed the nazis and the soviets to fight it out the fascists and the communists could have
fought it out that's a sort of interesting um that's an interesting essay to ask a 17 year old
history student to do but it's not serious politics and it's certainly not a basis for a policy go
back a bit earlier and you get the people who are now the reason why you've got this weird online
right-wing anti-churchillism i wrote about left-wing anti-churchillism because the left always wants to
attack churchill because they want to destroy the heroes they want to take out and deracinate the
public square you know take out jeffson take out lincoln take out but the right has its own right
now the right has an iteration of this and the rights iteration of it now as i said all right
we're talking about like inflection point people really their aim is to say that it was churchill who
got america into the war and churchill who indeed got the world into the war and this is of course
a historical nonsense but it's a pretty dangerous thing to play around with and the way i see it is
it's a and i've learned a bit more about this in uh recent months but um because i i sort of didn't
take it that seriously for a bit but i think what they're trying to do is is effectively a form of
david irvingism which is david irving who was a once renowned uh historian of world war ii in
hitler's germany uh he became more and more kooky as years went on or at least perhaps he revealed
himself as he years went on and he and others used to play this very dark game in the late 20th century
before it was effectively stopped in a courtroom when he was shown to be a hitler apologist
um was that they wanted to downplay the numbers of jews killed in the holocaust
up the number of people killed in for instance of the bombing of dresden
find moral parity between the two literally numbers parity and then make the final move which
was actually the nazis were better than the allies i think it's a version of that that is starting to
go around at the moment at the same time one cannot overestimate it because this isn't this isn't
something the president believes when it's involved in marco rubio doesn't and and so at the same time
i think we should not underestimate it because it has a potential among other things to completely
pollute the side that it's on well you take it seriously enough that in your recent appearance on
joe rogan alongside a comedian and libertarian dave smith i'm certain that anyone watching this by now has
seen that interview but for those who haven't go look it up after the show um you feel strongly
enough about this that straight out the gate in this interview where you were ostensibly there to
promote your new book you went right for it and criticized rogan and dave smith for having on having
kind of uncritical conversations let's say even praiseworthy conversations with amateur historians and
others who are playing around in the way that you described david irving playing around yes why were
you willing to die on this hill and let me explain what i mean by that joe rogan has a bigger audience
than probably all of cnn in a month i mean it's there's just no comparison he is the king kong of the
podcasting space there's a reason that everyone wants to go on that show especially people promoting
their books or promoting their work and there's every incentive to keep him happy so you'll continue to
get invited on you get invited on that show and you go right for it in challenging him and challenging
dave smith why did you decide to do that well i couldn't not i mean i just have a basic policy in
my life which is that if i uh you know and i i sometimes give this advice to students when i speak
at universities is that you just don't do things that make you feel worse about yourself you know
if there's something that's going to demoralize you that you're going to feel terrible about afterwards
feel lesser about yourself just just try not to do it uh i literally have it in this sort of could i
look myself in the mirror tomorrow if i did didn't do this and the answer is no and so i do it i don't
know if it's a hill to die on the number of hills that i've been on in my life and the number of
dying i've done and uh so i don't know i just i i genuinely i wasn't it was not i don't have anything
against joe i was um surprised that after a year and a half in israel two years of ukraine on three years
there have been so few people on who had in any ways mainstream views really about either conflict
uh i was surprised he hadn't had anyone on who really almost no one on who'd explained the ukrainian
case for self-defense against putin and i'm more alarmed in the last year and a half even to find
that he had had so few people on who'd explained the justification for israel's war in gaza whilst going
to people who i'm afraid to tread back into the uh uh the cesspool i managed to find myself in uh
in the weeks after that interview is i'm afraid is people who don't know what they're talking about
and i feel there's a very um there's a there's a lot that i feel like i trod into on that
but nevertheless i had i just felt i had to uh i don't i don't like that i don't like the
platforming of endless weird kooky voices from self i mean semi self-taught people i i so here's the
problem as i see it but is the problem with being self-taught or is that no it's not i mean and i
stressed repeatedly in the interview anyone can say anything they want within confines of the law
anyone can have a view on anything i'm for that i spent much of my career advocating for that
but that it doesn't mean just because some experts have let themselves down or let all of us down
it doesn't mean that you should simply lift the sluices of your society and allow all the sewage
to just flow through it and that's what i see happening and you see the problem here is joe is
a very skilled podcaster people don't realize how good he is until you see somebody can't do what he does
but if he if he wants somebody to discuss mma fighting you will notice that he does not invite
comedian dave smith because comedian dave smith has never been in a fight or to a fight or maybe he
has but about i don't think he'd know how to talk about the jujitsu maybe he would maybe it surprised
me but i joe would not have him on to talk about something that joe knows about so why does he have him
on to talk about a conflict that the guy knows so little about um somebody recently up on x a snippet
of an interview that joe did a while ago with one of these pseudo historians where he says you know
nobody has a right to say that you're a neo-nazi or hitler apologist unless they've uh imbibed your
work and listened to all of it and you know it's like talking to somebody who thinks they know about a
country who's never been there and i think yeah yeah that was one of the points i was trying to
make i mean i was pretty alarmed by some of i don't really follow uh fires i've started in general
but i was pretty alarmed by the reaction i was pretty alarmed by the number of people who found
it including joe and dave found it to be some kind of really weird uh snooty elitist thing to say
if you're going to write about a place you should have been there or know about it you should you
should you should do some of the legwork i was pretty alarmed about that simply because in old
media and i certainly that was a stand on it good god the old media legacy media let us all down in
ways that you and i could riff about for a fortnight but there are standards one of them for instance is
that you know you cannot file uh columns about uh uh gaza if you've never left berkeley or san diego
or wherever and just to play it another way around i mean if what i was saying was just such basic
journalistic hygiene which is yes if you're going to talk endlessly about a conflict you ought to do what
i do and at least put in the legwork and it's kind of in a way it's insulting to all the many
journalists who put themselves under dangerous and difficult positions to say yeah that's just
nah you you don't need to do that there's no you know i i can tell as much by sitting in austin uh
reading uh uh google and just to put it another way around if uh if there was a guy in china
who was on chinese state media what other type is there and endlessly wrote about the united states
of america didn't speak english and had never been to the usa but who endlessly told the audience in
in china that america in the 21st century is no different from america in the 19th century
in fact the kkk roams the streets of new york freely and persecutes our black brothers and sisters and
and and that and that segregation is still going on it and and all sorts of other stuff like that
if we got wind of this guy and we found out this is a this is a this is a guy in china who's never
been to america and he's telling the chinese people about america and it's so wrong
we would laugh at that we would think it ridiculous that such a person had platforms
so why why i ask should it be the case that endlessly if you want to hear about the reality
of israel and gaza get the comedian guy on who's never been to the region as he admitted on that
podcast in fact not being to the region seemed to be some kind of badge of honor it meant that he
wasn't tainted by uh some of the um perspectives he might have got i think yeah on the other hand
you'd have noticed that israel isn't a white supremacist society governing a concentration camp in gaza
i think one of the dynamics at play here and this goes beyond the conversation that you had with smith
on rogan i think it's just a bigger dynamic playing out right now is over the past decade probably
longer the left was in the business of making everything taboo even biological reality exactly
this is a backlash and the reaction the cultural right is having the right like broadly defined here
and i think it's breaking apart in all kinds of interesting ways is no no you guys said everything
taboo we're making nothing taboo and so the second someone comes around as you tried to do in that
conversation and say actually you know what the stigmatization of holocaust denial that's a good
stigma that's something we should keep around the standard of going to a place that you write about
that's something we should keep around what the listener i think can hear in that situation
is this is a person calling for cancel culture this is a person calling for gatekeeping yeah and i find
that dynamic extremely frustrating it's very frustrating how do you get out of that trap one i just
you've got to exercise hygiene on your own side um and the fact that people have been kept out of the
conversation who should have been in the conversation does not mean that absolutely everybody should be
given the platform to spread untrue things and it's very it's it's gonna be yeah i mean like like everything
difficult in this life it's uh it's it's going to take some dexterity because all these fine corners
that end up mattering they do need careful thinking and careful treading my my fear on it is i think that
something among other things something quite dishonest has been going on which is that joe and dave were
covering for a couple of people in particular who are mates of theirs who they deny are bad actors and
yet the more i look into them the more appalling the bad actorness is just this morning somebody sent
some something to me of one of the mates of one of these historians who's anti-churchill and so on
and this is one of his mates and somebody he cites and this i won't give the publicity to the person
by naming him this guy in this video i watched this morning goes to the holocaust memorial in dc
and just does a video about what horse it all is the holocaust yeah and it's all just it's all seems to
me to be kind of you know lame and gay and fake and we're all being told to believe this just to
guilt us and you know not falling for it anymore you don't want to be within you don't want to be
in the orbit of somebody like that you don't want to be encouraging that you know you can you can
easily easily as a right and somebody who's been small c conservative all my life i mean i had a
probably a lapse at university of a period where for about five hours i was on the left but um but
but i've been broadly on the right most of my life and just as the left should be totally
not tolerating shea gevara is a maoism stalinism leninism don't don't let the right when they're on
the art when they're working when they're actually doing some of the things that restrain some of the
obscenities and overreaches of the left don't use that time to try hitlerism again for god's sake don't
be the thing that your enemies said you might be like this shouldn't be that difficult and i intervened
on that episode and rogan because i just felt i had to and uh i'm glad i did but i'm sorry that
some people have willfully or otherwise decided to completely misrepresent what i was saying but
as you know barry one of the things about being in the public square is that not only do you have
to forge your words for people to understand them clearly you also have to forge them in such a way
that a malevolent actor will not deliberately misrepresent possible okay i want to talk about
your book and i think the way maybe to set the scene here is we're living in a moment douglas where
we have a cultural right let's not say the right but a increasing group with increasing power on the
cultural right that is you know revising whether or not churchill was a good or a bad guy revising
whether or not the holocaust was as evil and as bad as we remember while at the same time we have
a very powerful movement and a chic movement um on the left that is calling to globalize the intifada
that you know just at yale a few nights ago students in hamas headbands were chanting you know
father son mother daughter we will honor all our martyrs while harassing jewish students this was
at yale not yet one of trump's targets before we get to the book i want you to just diagnose for me
where we are you know there's a understanding that anti-semitism rising anti-semitism the mainstreaming of
anti-semitism is a sign that a society is in very dire straits is that what you see here in america
or in the west and if not what is the reason that these ideological movements seem to be gaining such
power at the moment it's again it's slightly like where we start off i'm wary of it because i'm wary of
over diagnosing and of under diagnosing i never like the uh you know i've spent the last year and
a half covering the actual war in the middle east uh as you know i mean the book is really about three
things one is what happened on october the 7th and the testimonies i get from survivors and families and
others the second is that i wanted to see and chronicle israel's military response and societal
response up close and the third thing really in the book is to ask why why in this fight between
what i call a democracy and a death cult between the nation of israel and the death cults of hamas
hezbollah the iranian revolutionary government who literally worship death love death seek death for
others and for themselves why would so many people find it so hard to know which side to be on and
i i spent a lot of time thinking about that because it's haunted me ever since i saw the first bits of
footage coming out of israel of the hamas terrorists killing people with such ecstasy
and you know it would be equivalent to if in the 40s the nazis had broadcast from bergen belson
to the world boasting and then anyone in the world saying no didn't happen or well it may have happened
but there's some reasons and and so on these guys broadcast to the world what they were doing
so why did so much of the elite world and some other bits as well you know but why did so much
of the elite world go on to the side of the death cult i'm concerned about not getting this question
wrong because on the one hand talking about ivy league campuses is so damn rarefied what do these
places mean really they mean that our elite institutions have gone rotten you and i could have
told anyone that at any time in our adult lifetimes but so i don't want to exaggerate it because because
a lot of just ordinary americans on the streets don't want this no but there's a reason there's
a reason i'm allowed to say yes you are yes but there's a recent poll of young americans and an
astonishingly high number identify with hamas this is not a survey of harvard undergrads it's young
americans getting their information from tick tock and hassan pikeron's twitch and and who knows what
else so i do think that that is real and the kind of inoculation perhaps that was granted to a
generation above us um that you know i guess the shoah inadvertently provided that inoculation is gone
it's gone i think i think it's not just that that is gone i think that there's something very important
psychologically which i if i can say so which i identify in the book which is in the book before
this the war on the west i talked at some length about the anti-americanism and anti-westernism that
existed in america in particular um and what i said there was that there was a very dangerous thing
being set up in the united states and in other western countries which was that young people born
in the 21st century were being told that they were guilty of things they could not possibly conceivably
be said to have guilt for you know you are guilty if you are born in america in the 21st century of
slavery uh genocide ethnic cleansing white supremacy and so on these these are all charges you can take
on their own and they have more and less legitimacy wherever you want to look in the american past as in
any country's past but to say to people you are guilty with no form of alleviation of the guilt was
as i said in the war in the west an extremely dangerous trap to put people into i lent on hana
arend's uh philosophy on this about the not setting up a a system of guilt with no possibility of
forgiveness and i said in the war in the west i didn't know exactly how it was going to manifest
i could see it manifesting in the western anti-westernism and the american anti-americanism
one thing you can be sure of as alan bloom said uh in the 1980s one thing you could be sure of
was not just that a student at an american elite university would think that all truth was relative
but by the 2020s that all the problems of the world were our fault now as i see it much of the reaction
of the uh the student uh groups and so on first of all it's all imported in one way or another well
the ideas are soviet there's that there's also the fact that honor our martyrs come on this is imported
crap this is qatari funded qatari influenced iranian influenced import ideology this is not a generic
ideology that happened to crop up at yale but i want to push back on that because i do think that's
a little bit of a cope like i we have a huge story in the free press today about the 29 billion dollars
from foreign governments including cutter and china that have flowed into elite universities and
if you're looking to invest and pour fuel on a fire of anti-americanism you can do no better than
the ivy league but let's not delude ourselves into thinking that i'm by no means pretending that that's
the only cause i'm saying that once something is pushed like this once a kerosene like this is
pushed by a foreign power into a highly receptive environment something happens and i'll just quickly
explain what it is that's happened what has happened in the last 18 months and not just on the campuses
at a grand union station here in new york the other night where protesters pro hamas protesters shut
the station down again uh what they're doing is what a psychologist would call projection
they are accusing the state of israel of all of the things that they have been taught that they
themselves are guilty of they have been told that by dint of being in america in the 21st century you
are on stolen land what do you do about it do any of the kids or their professors in question want to
hand over the ground of ucla to a tribe that has died out or and they don't they could they don't
but what can you do i wonder it turns out that you can accuse the one jewish state in the world
of all of the crimes that you have been told you are guilty of by dint of being born in the west
why does this stuff work so well in specific countries works so well in america so well in
australia so well in canada so well in britain in the anglosphere effectively because all of these
countries have been prepared for this in recent years they have all been prepared knowingly or otherwise
for just such a moment of scapegoatism just such a moment where you can say all of my sins all of the
things that i've been like the uh scientologists you know with the particles they believe that you
get from some this is how they go this is how you go clear this is how you go clear this is how you
you you you you decide your student days will be best spent hollering hollering against the state of
israel because you can accuse them of all the things you've been told you're guilty of this is
projection on a massive scale but but the evil the evil that it reveals is extraordinary i give an
example in the book of many examples but one of the ones that really shattered me was when the nova
party uh which as people will know was one of the targets that hamas came upon that morning
it was hope the 7th 2023 when the nova party was memorialized it was um it was an exhibition you
probably saw i saw it in tel aviv when it started but it it was a memorial exhibition and a sort of
recreation of you know what happened testimony and it and the exhibition traveled to los angeles and also
here to new york not far from where we're sitting at the moment and when this exhibition opened it was
greeted by hundreds of protesters who some of whom on the way you'll remember covered their faces in
kefirs and covid masks because as i can never resist saying these people are simultaneously hot for
intifada and fearful of the covert 19 virus wildly worried about the uh the delta variant i'm sure we can
agree but these cowards the new kkk they cover their faces just like this they're cowards these people
are on the new york subway chanting that asking for any zionists to identify themselves and get off the
train they get to uh the center of new york and they go to the nova exhibition and they stand outside
and they chant support for hamas support for intifada support for the murder of people at the nova party
claim that the nova party itself was guilty and a legitimate target one of the men walking through
the street of new york that day to the exhibition was a father who lost his daughters at the party
he had to walk in new york past the crowd of hundreds of people with a stage and megaphones celebrating the
murder of his children what level of evil do you have to have fallen into that you would think that you
would stand outside a memorial to the young people killed at that party and say that the young people
dancing in the early hours were guilty and deserved the slaughter and the rape and the murder and the
beheading and the kidnapping this is not a problem for israel and i've said this since october the 8th
this is not a problem for israel israel has an army and it has a civilian army and it has the right to
make its own decisions about how it protects itself but this is a profound problem for america and the
rest of the west that we have people in our midst who glorify in the death cults who find it easy to
decide some people find it difficult to decide whether they're on the side of israel or hamas i don't
i know which side i'm on i know which side i want to thrive and to win and i know which side i want to
to be over in order that the israelis can live in peace and the palestinians can live in peace hamas
is a disaster for israel but it's an even bigger disaster for the palestinians but that aside why
do so many people find it so easy to be on the side of the death cult of hamas and why do so many of
them not sure which side i'm on here same people who said for years believe all women they don't
believe israeli women when they're raped they simultaneously deny that women were raped on
the 7th of october and claim that the idf when they go into gaza can't help but rape women
once again projection you claim that israel is doing things your own side is doing what they
accuse the israelis of being baby killers i see everything you've i i they support the baby killers
they literally love the baby killers but how is it simply that people that that evil is real yes
evil of course evil is real yes but explain give us your best explanation of the unexplainable how can
it be that so many people who've been educated at the most storied institutions in american life
are falling prey to this and maybe put another way and you write about this in the book and
as i read it i'm like wow i can't i can't believe i didn't think about it this way you know there's been
so many protests since october 7 2023 and what you write about and point out is that there was no mass
protest in this country against hamas no no i'm i'm an optimist i believe that the vast majority of
ordinary americans understand which side is overwhelmingly on the side of good and which
is on the side of evil in this conflict but explain that to us how have the most vocal passionate people
been on the side of evil and where are the voices in this country and perhaps in the west more broadly
on the side of the good well there are a lot of people on the side of the good a lot of good
people with a voice and some without many without um i i have no instinctive sort of optimism or sort of
panglossianism nor pessimism or depression about any of this i simply look at the situation as it is
i would just say that there are a couple of historical examples i give in the book which i'm
really really keen that people absorb which are relatively little known but the aim of them from
previous outbursts of anti-israelism anti-semitism anti-jewishness and so on one of the things i'm
very keen to point out in a couple of the stories and anecdotes i tell historical comparisons i make is
to enliven people to the to recognize the idea that sometimes you can become precisely the thing you
meant not to become sometimes in the name everybody used to know this sometimes in order to do the
worst evil you have to think you're doing the greatest good sometimes you'll find yourself
thinking for instance i'm an anti-nazi i'm an anti-nazi i'm sure i'm an anti-nazi i've always been
anti-nazi i don't like the people and then you're on the side of him as because of reasons i give in
the book ah the truth is as i say at one point in the book that our age is very loathed to use the
theological language of evil but it's become my certain belief in the last couple of years
that we have to be able to use this term because some things deserve it and the actions of hamas
absolutely deserve it not just their treatment of the israelis on october the 7th and since in
the treatment of the kidnappees but the treatment of people in their own society they claim to govern
um if evil exists as a force in the world as i believe it does then it must be countered
judiciously carefully always always as i believe i've seen with the idf always in the knowledge that
what you are doing must be in defense of a society and not motivated by a hatred
but it must be comprehensively destroyed and i have little truck with people who say that hamas alone of
all human ideologies is indestructible without needing to cite the nazis i would just say
look at the cult of the emperor in japan in up until 1945 we thought it could never be destroyed
it was far more powerful than hamas far more powerful and this country america with so many
people on the left and now on the right want to disparage they pretend that they did no good in the world
this country america among its many great achievements saw off the death cult of the japanese emperor
by military defeat and by moral victory and if america could do that then it can do it again now
okay i want to take some questions from people that have been sending them in and thank you all so much
please continue to send them in um douglas one of our readers asked this do you think that the new
rights anti-churchill anti-endless war stance has anti-semitism at its core
well only in the same way that everything has anti-semitism at its core i mean everything does it's amazing
the jews are like there is the perfect scapegoat i'm completely convinced by girard's uh analysis of
the scapegoat in human society this is renee girard yeah and um it's a violence and sacred and i'm
completely convinced by it so it's a just a perennial human psychological need um among other things by the
the jews jews end up being the perfect scapegoat because what happens with paranoids with what happens with
paranoia you don't need to have met a jew uh to start to get paranoid about jews if you're going
down a level of paranoia because somebody somebody's controlling thing i can't understand the world
somebody must understand it and there must be somebody running it otherwise it's damn disorder
everywhere and like nobody's in control and i can't cope with that thing so i'll decide there
are a group of people in control and then in the end it's quite easy to see it as being bankers
and then that would be the rothschilds obviously it wouldn't be bank of america and it wouldn't be
the bank of scotland it can't be the bank of scotland it's got to be lost child's gotta be
only thing that makes sense if i see a puppet master because there must be a puppet master
because otherwise it's so darn complicated in this life and like if there's a puppet master like is it
better if their surname ends with witz or stein or is it better if it finishes with smith like ah the
steins and the schmitz are sort of more available for the great and there you are then you're off
and so yes i mean look at the way in which the isolationists like buchanan they always end up with
with the thing that somehow you know you're never america was never lured into war
by uh armitage and powell it's it's the the gotta be wolfowitz it's gotta be wolfowitz
it's it's it's gotta be dick pearl who was one member of an advisory board to the pentagon for
a time it's it's it's never obama like it's never samantha power i don't think so one of the things
is uh this unfunny comic said to me on the the the rogan thing was that the wolfowitz wolfowitz
remember it's always best to do it like that the the the wolfowitz doctrine had been trying
to topple all these states and it had been done and i think the only one he was right on i think
if i remember right it was libya which happened happened under president obama's time so like
they'll always find a jew somewhere not even connected to the administration of the time who
they can blame for this and i'm sorry but that is just so transparent so transparent okay someone
else asks i have my daughter's ivy league university graduation in three weeks congratulations last year
they had pro hamas protests how can i preempt this disruption what should we parents shout back if they
do show up douglas any slogan they should shout it's so sad because i don't i wish nobody had to do this
i wish nobody had to do this these people are polluting the life of the university polluting a
graduation day this should be a great moment of pride for the family and for the students it should
not be disrupted by these people i would personally say to the administration that after my child has got
heavily in debt for the great pleasure of being at this university i would appreciate it very much if the
ceremony ceremony was not overtaken by ideologues and maniacs of any stripe so that's what i would ask
first and if i saw them on the day depending on how much fire i had in my belly that day i would
uh well i'd have quite a lot of choice things to say to them but i imagine many of them will be masked
tell them to bring up bring up take their masks off if they're so so damn proud if they're so damn proud
of their work i don't mask you don't mask we're proud of our work we're proud of what we say we
stand by what we say unmask you cards douglas a lot of people ask a version of this question which
is what can we do a lot of people who read the free press and also and of course read your brilliant
brilliant sunday column things worth remembering identify with you admire you trust what you are
saying and the way you're diagnosing the problem and they think to themselves and they're asking in
the questions i don't have a large platform but i care so much about the kind of problems you're
describing and i'm alarmed douglas as you are what can we do they ask to stand up against the rise of
anti-semitism and and anti-americanism in our country well the first thing is we should identify
both of those things we shouldn't be afraid to you know what one things i'm surprised by about this
dissonant bit on the right that we talked about earlier is that it is anti-american just as surely
as the chomskyite left was anti-american when it said that america could do no good in the world
and never had done any good so the isolationist ish right is also being anti-american they believe
that america's never done any good in the world i think that's flat out wrong we should say it's
anti-american just as we should not be afraid to call out anti-semitism where it exists and identify
it as such i'm sorry you've done nothing about any other rights issue anywhere in the world and
suddenly the one jewish state does something in self-defense i'm sorry anti-semite of course of
course and that's not gatekeeping or shutting down it's just a diagnosis and if you're an anti-semite
why not be proud of it when i say you are admit it admit that you have this dark thing in your heart
what can people do the most important thing i think is people should not give up on the fact that
in a society like this where everybody has a voice i think everybody should use their voice i don't think
it's about the size of the platform you know it's about the one-to-one face-to-face interaction which
has always been one of the guiding things in this country even the much oversighted to tocville
says that he's surprised by the face-to-face nature of american debate i also think back to
when i knew absolutely nothing about all this when i was a student at oxford i haven't said this before
but i remember once getting into a late night discussion with some contemporaries the second
intifada was going on i knew nothing about it but i was horrified as everybody was by seeing the
killing and the deaths on the pages i think the janine massacre had just been claimed to have
occurred or maybe that was sometime later and all the papers and the bbc and everything else in the
uk was filled with uh anti-israel stuff and i suppose i was you know as worried as anyone else what's
there seems to be killing going on and i'm uh intelligent enough i'm uh grown up enough to know
killing is bad but i'm not yet intelligent enough to know that that's not enough
um and i remember a fellow student who was younger than me who happened to be jewish
who was very angry with the discussion as it was going informing us of what was actually happening
and what the intifada meant and what it meant to people like him to see the buses blowing up and
so on and i wasn't yet dogmatic enough but we talked about it and he helped change my mind
and i think it's worth saying that because everybody has a voice and you can use it
judiciously and well and bravely and that's the case whether you're a student arguing with other
students or um somebody with a big platform it doesn't really matter the size of the platform is
not the point the point is simply whether or not you use your voice well in the time you have and
to my mind and i've said this to you before barry that i do believe that the great thing about truth
is that it punctures the darkness that a glimmer of light is recognized as truth that we do know truth
when we see it we can see it we have the ability to discern it just as surely as we can see a ray of
light in the dark and it dispels the dark and what's more makes people feel less alone in the dark once
you recognize it i think everybody has this opportunity and they should use it and it might be
you know it might be hopeless it might feel hopeless at times but never people should never doubt the fact
that just like that discussion discussion i mentioned as a student as an ignorant student
many years ago i i think people shouldn't forget that almost nobody changes their mind like that
it's always a process and what you do is you just put a fact into someone's head that they may not have
considered and then the rest is their responsibility you know it's such a beautiful
place to end i do want to ask you one more question though and that's about
this book and really the way that you have spent the past year and a half almost two years since
october 7th despite what many people on the internet i'm sure are saying you are not jewish yourself
you're not a foreign correspondent with a particular newspaper you write for a lot of places including
happily us and yet i think you have done more to cover the war since october 7th and i think
certainly know that you have done more to expose the irrational hatred of jews and of the jewish state
and really of the west than anyone else that's alive right now um talk to me a little bit as as maybe
a way to close about why you've prioritized this story there's a lot of important stories going on in
the world and of course you've covered those two you've gone to kiev and you've traveled all over
ukraine and i know if there's some kind of dangerous hot spot you will inevitably show up there in a
flak jacket and a helmet but this story has captured your time and your care and your thoughtfulness and
your attention more than any other and i think for a lot of people even those who are broadly sympathetic
to your world view for them it will still feel like something happening thousands of miles away that
might feel very far away to them and i'd love for you to explain in a busy world with only one person
that has 24 hours in his day why this story has so captured you why you have been so tireless and
passionate in exposing it and in telling it it's a lot of things um one is as i've said to you before
i don't like lies and i hate the lies told about israel and if you've covered any conflict there you'll
know that more than any other war zone this is a war zone in which lies just go out everywhere every day
people lie about the idea if they lie about what the israelis have suffered as well as what they do
so that gets me on an intellectual level there's obviously emotional levels which
some of which are probably too deep for me to go into but
one of them is you see is i do think that on one level the supporters of the death cults the people who
would use their energies calling for the overthrow of all western civilization but who zoom in and by
that that's not an exaggeration of course that's literally what the columbia student protesters asked
for the overthrow the destruction of all western civilization so i'm not on board with that because
i love the civilization i'm from and i wanted to continue but they think that the first target
they can actually take out is israel that's their view they think they can take out a country of 9
million people faster and more easily than you can take out a country of 340 million people or so
and they're probably right in that regard they're probably right if you try to overthrow the united states
of america hard want to crush and completely destroy uh um the united kingdom not as hard
could be done people have tried before but didn't work
want to crush a state that's not yet 80 and um
uh has only nine million people in it in a very dangerous region surrounded by people who want to
annihilate the people of the country well these people see that as being achievable now what what is
it other than that it's achievable ah it was a fatal blow to all the rest of the west
the western tradition as you know as your viewers know is based on the legacy of the bible
and of athens athens and jerusalem if you were to take jerusalem out of the equation
you do absolutely cut off the tree of western civilization not on a branch but at the root
the whole tree dies i mentioned at one point in the book as you know the passage from deuteronomy
choose life somebody said to me earlier today but such an obvious edict i said no no it's not obvious
it wasn't obvious at the time of the prophets that people should choose life
any more than it was obvious at the time the ten commandments that murder was bad people murdering
each other all over the place um but my point is is that this this target of the anti-israel movement
the anti-western movement they believe israel is the first thing they can get
i believe that in one way they are clever in their target selection they are right the islamists
believe that if they take out jerusalem as the holy city of the jewish faith and indeed of the christian
faith that they can win for their own religious cause the uh anti-semites around the world always
seem to believe that if you get rid of the jews something magical happens in the world
um i believe they've selected their target well in one way they're correct to understand the
significance of jerusalem i agree with them on the significance of jerusalem it's just that unlike
them i don't want jerusalem to fall and that comes to the second tiny bit of an answer to that question
which is this in one way as i said they've chosen their target well and in another way they've chosen
it so wrong because yes they're right they're right if you attack the tradition of the bible you
attack the jewish people you attack the jewish state you take out this root of western civilization
and you contaminate everything which is what always happens everyone knows anti-semitism is a problem
for jews yes but then every other horror comes out of the box but here's the thing the reason they've
chosen it wrong is that in my belief and having spent much of the last 18 months with the young
men and women of the idf israel isn't going anywhere it's not going anywhere the famous thing that
golda meyer said to joe biden we have a secret weapon and he thought that she was going to tell him
that they had the atomic bomb what is the secret weapon we have nowhere else to go the great realization
of hetzel and the visionaries of the 19th century of jabotinsky and the rest the great realization that
has been resolved is the jewish people must defend the jewish people with any friends they have
hopefully with many but the jewish people will defend the jewish people in the jewish homeland
and they will not give it up and they to quote the psalmist i shall not die i shall live
and in the face of the people who are calling for the murder and destruction of the jewish people
my belief is they have chosen wrong because the jewish people and their friends will continue to say i
shall not die but i shall live douglas murray it's always such a pleasure to talk to you on microphone
or over drinks which hopefully we'll do later your book of course is on democracies and death cults it
is a new york times bestseller it is a sunday times bestseller i'm sure it's a thousand other bestsellers i
saw during easter weekend you were even beating like the easter bunny book on amazon which was huge
the easter bunny books all died of natural causes that sunday so uh i didn't have to do a jihad a
hunt against easter bunny books in the end but the book next book will be called on democracies deaf
cults and hippity hoppy easter bunny perfect um for those of you who have not yet picked up this book
i cannot recommend it more highly douglas murray thank you so much it's my great pleasure
you
