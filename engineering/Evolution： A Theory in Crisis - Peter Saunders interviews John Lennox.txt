well hello and welcome everybody once again to icmda webinars i'm dr peter saunders the chief
executive of the international christian medical and dental association and today we're privileged
again to have professor john lennox who's going to be discussing with me the subject of evolution
a theory in crisis based on his recent book icmda brings together about 60 000 christian doctors
and dentists from uh over 80 countries around the world and the way it's going to work today
we're not having a talk but the whole thing will be discussion and q a well uh the neo-darwinian
theory of biological evolution uh the so-called modern synthesis is still regarded by many as
ruling out fears and belief in god but uh there are big questions about it and i can't think of
anyone better to uh address these from a christian perspective than professor john lennox john is
a professor of mathematics at oxford university and a fellow in mathematics and philosophy of science at
green temple college oxford green templeton college he's also an associate fellow of this of the sade
business school oxford university and teachers for the oxford strategic leadership program professor
lennox is particularly interested in the interface of science uh philosophy and theology and his books
include against the flow seven days that divide the world on genesis one gunning for god on the new
atheism stephen hawking and god a response to the grand design god's undertaker has science buried god
uh and where is god in a coronavirus world and 2084 i can really recommend all of those books for a good
uh workout uh he's also written another book more recently which is the subject of today's discussion
a bit more about that later john has uh also debated a number of prominent atheists including richard
richard dawkins christopher hitchens and peter singer and you can access his uh website at www.johnlennox.org
so john it's a real pleasure to have you back on icmda webinars today we're very grateful for
you giving the time to this and uh we're really looking forward to what you have to say
now uh as we've mentioned many listeners will be familiar with your book god's undertaker has science
buried god which came out some years ago but uh i think far fewer will be familiar with your more
recent book cosmic chemistry uh where you build significantly on the arguments from your first book
and i was intrigued to read it recently uh and uh was on the strength of this that i've asked you
to come along today and address questions on the topic evolution of theory and crisis and of course
there's much much more in that book about faith and science than just evolution but that's what we
want to concentrate on today now of course we're told aren't we that the extraordinary biological
complexity and diversity we see on planet earth is the result of a long process of millions of years
involving inanimate matter first giving rise to dna and protein dna and protein producing organisms
then unicellular organisms giving rise to multicellular organisms then to invertebrates and then to
vertebrates reptiles birds and mammals and i want to get into the detail of this with you
as much as we can in the time we've got today but i first want to ask you about the impact of the
theory of evolution on christian belief and the best apologetic approach to use when discussing it
so uh first of all but before the theory of evolution came along most people living in europe
were theists they believed in god and one of the strongest arguments for theism was the so-called
teleological argument the argument from design which the apostle paul himself uses in romans chapter one
but what evolution did in effect was to offer an alternative explanation for biological diversity
and complexity that did not require god in other words it made atheism intellectually respectable
what impact do you think the theory of evolution has had on christian belief john especially in europe
and how important is it for christians to be able to talk about evolution intelligently
well i'm delighted to be with you on icmda and greetings to all of you around the world
the impact of the theory of evolution has been very deep particularly in europe and i still meet it
even in academic circles as one of the number one reasons for believing in god
people just say it was okay up to the time of darwin to believe in an intelligently designed universe
but now we've got this explanation in terms of natural processes of the kind that
the natural sciences studies so we don't need god anymore now even at the time of darwin though
there were people who rapidly rushed in and said but just a moment isn't it possible that what
he discovered and what was subsequently added to it was god's method of creating the world so
it didn't create worldwide atheism um but it's still as someone has said a wonderful
engine for generating atheism the impact is great and among students particularly and young people
you still find it's they feel it's the knockdown argument against god
yeah and um how important is it for christians to be able to talk about evolution particularly christians
from a scientific background our audience today of course are all dentists and doctors
i think it's extremely important though not everyone is a biologist i'm not a biologist i'm a mathematician
but i'm encouraged by the fact that from darwin to dawkins people have written to try to convince the
thinking public of the truth of this theory so i approach it at the level of the public understanding
of science and i think it is extremely important that christians especially educated christians and
certainly christians in the medical and dental fields know how to find their way and navigate the issues
because it's very easy to get lost in a morass of side argument rather than concentrating on the main issues
yeah absolutely and and the theory of evolution of course creates a lot of tension even between christians
let alone between christians and atheists and the bible believing christians seem to be divided into
three main camps uh in the uk i i know it's basically a third in each of these there are first of all there
are the young earth six-day creationists who take genesis chapter one very literally in terms of
six 24-hour periods then there are the old earth uh theistic evolutionists who accept darwin's theory
but argue that evolution was a divinely guided process that god used that you've already mentioned
that uh back in the 19th century and then in between we've got old earthers who are special
creationists in other words they argue that god made a number of interventions in history to create
different kinds of life and i'm not going to ask you which category you most closely identify with but
rather i want to ask you about the best way of talking about evolution to atheists who who see
evolution as a real barrier to faith should we be promoting one of these three views our favorite
one or or should we rather just be laying bare the shortfalls of evolutionary theory uh to show that
believing in a creator god is still a plausible position what what's your your own apologetic approach
addressing this well it's very kind of you not to ask me to commit myself to one of these three views
i have of course written the book on that very topic and you might be interested to know there's
a very new edition of it seven days that divide the world but the important point is exactly that of
course we should promote a biblical view and of course we should lay bare the shortfalls of
evolutionary theory but i would stress at the very beginning that we need to distinguish very
carefully between primary and secondary issues for example the fact of creation in the beginning god
created the heavens and the earth is vastly more important in representing christianity to the
contemporary atheistic world and post-modern world than when it happened or how it happened although
both of those questions are interesting the first one is more interesting to scientists and the second
one is more interesting to theologians so if we distinguish between those two and remember to be humble
intellectually humble that let me put it this way i believe that scripture is god inspired it is the word
of god but i'm not claiming to understand all of it i also am passionate about science but there are
questions of interpretation on both sides and we need to try to distinguish what is reasonably evidently fact
and what are our deductions from that and my approach is simply this that on the precise issue that you've
asked me deducing atheism as many do from evolutionary biology depends on the truth of two propositions which
are very different the first is is it philosophically legitimate to deduce a world view atheism from biology
neodarwinian evolution the second thing does neodarwinian evolution actually bear all the weight that people put on it
now those are two very different questions the first one is philosophical and logical the second one is primarily scientific
and we need to distinguish between them um one of my colleagues at oxford here who's just retired alistair mcgrath
points out that there's a substantial logical gap between darwinism and atheism and he adds the rather
delightful point which dawkins he says seems to prefer to bridge by rhetoric rather than evidence now my position on that
is that to the extent that guided biological evolution in any sense has occurred then of course it's certainly
compatible with theism because god is behind it but the issue is has it occurred and does it bear all the weight
that's put on it and i understand you want me to concentrate on that point
that's right and and i want to i want to as much as as possible and the time we've got to to walk you
through the different stages from inanimate matter up to uh vertebrates and particularly human beings so
let's start right at the beginning and uh with the biochemistry john we were all taught at school uh that amino
acids which of course are the building blocks of protein
were produced in a primeval soup where electrical discharges acted on a mixture of water vapor
ammonia methane and hydrogen uh you know the the operon theory i think it is miller's experience uh
experiments now i know you're very skeptical about this uh on scientific grounds why why is that
well the important thing here peter is to realize and i want to emphasize this point
i'm not a professional biologist though i've studied a great deal of biology
so what i'm going to say is primarily coming from the mouths of people that work in the field
that's extremely important to check out what is actually happening and before we get into this
we need to distinguish between what's called chemical evolution and biological evolution that
that is what happens after life has started now richard dawkins has confused this issue for many years
because he wrote in his famous book the blind watchmaker that natural selection accounts for both
the existence and variation of all of life and it took him a very long time to really realize that
natural selection cannot account for the existence of life because of course natural selection is a
biological phenomenon it depends on life existing in the first place so it cannot account for it so we
need to distinguish very carefully between those two different kinds of things which unfortunately are both
called evolution although they're very different processes now to address your question directly
geochemists first of all now think that the earth's early atmosphere did not contain the quantities of
ammonia and methane and hydrogen needed to produce the kind of atmosphere that was required by operand's hypothesis
secondly getting amino acid building blocks which they did they got some of them would only be the beginning
because the problem is not so much getting the blocks although that theory does not produce them
the problem the problem is getting them in the right kind of order you see
let's take the simple thing first if you proteins are composed of amino acids and a short protein maybe has
a hundred most of them are about 300 and they exist in two forms the l and d forms that are mirror images
and these two forms appear in equal numbers in a prebiotic simulation so that the probability of getting
one or other is a half but the great majority of proteins contain only the left form and the probability of
getting a hundred of l form is a half to the power of 100 which is about one chance in 10 to the 30.
so right at the very start you're having huge probabilities to face minuscule probabilities to face
just in getting the right size but then you have to join the amino acids together and
protein demands bonds the peptide bonds to be of a certain kind in order that and this is hugely
important that the protein folds into the right structure in three dimensions yet only half the
bonds in simulations are peptides so here we go again the probability of getting 100 like that is
1 in 10 to the 30 so you're now down to 1 in 10 to the 60. so at the very start before we even begin
to discuss the ordering of amino acids the probabilities are very much against getting this by prebiotic
simulations yeah now so let's move from amino acids to proteins then and in your book you just you say
that proteins are and i quote immensely specialized intricate constructions of long chains of amino acids
in a specific in a specific linear order and of course as you also said this particular configuration
they've got to fold and bend in the right way to work as enzymes or proteins and you you say a major
problem for scientists to explain is the origin of the informational structure of protein can you explain
what you mean by that and and why it is such a problem well i think the simple way to look at this
is to take us immediately to the most famous molecule in the world the the dna molecule which is
consists of 3.4 roughly billion chemical letters in a specific order looking very much like
a piece of computer code in fact that's the language that is used and that determines the sequence of
the amino acids they have to be lined up in precisely that hugely long and hugely complex sequence and that
is the problem that has to be addressed now i love reading physicist paul davis he's usually very graphic
and he says making a protein by simply injecting energy is like exploding a stick of dynamite under a pile
of bricks and expecting it to form a house the point is that you can produce bricks but making a house requires
a plan it requires information it so the builders can follow that and put the bricks into the right
place and that's a trivial job compared with uh getting the amino acids in the right places in this chain
get a single one in the wrong place just like if you get a single letter in the wrong place in a computer program
it could become another word but it's more likely become complete nonsense
and the the problem for example there are 20 amino acids and getting one on a specific site
probability is one in 20 so getting 100 in the correct order would be 1 over 20 the power of 100 which is
about 1 in 10 to the power 130 and then once you get there you realize that that kind of simple mathematics
concerns concerns only a single protein but life requires hundreds of thousands of proteins and
it has been calculated that the odds against producing these by chance is more than 1 in 10 to the 40 000
and that's what provoked sir fred hoyle who was a formidable mathematician to say that the probability
against the spontaneous formation of life was something like the chance of a tornado sweeping
through a junkyard producing a boeing 747 yeah i mean that really puts it into context
uh in terms of those big numbers john just remind us what the number of atoms in the universe is
i think they they reckon about 10 to the 80 and so these other numbers are just incredibly great
sir roger penrose who's probably one of the greatest living mathematicians he says the probability of the
creator now he's not a theist he's an atheist the creator producing a universe like this one in which
there's a second law of thermodynamics is around one in 10 to the 30 and that means that if you put a one
and then zeros on every elementary particle in the universe you couldn't even write the the number out
so there's something going on here and the mathematician in me says look there must be something else
and my answer is this is the evidence of an input of intelligence because the way we measure it
is in terms of information and information and intelligence are associated in our minds intimately
yes well those numbers are astounding let's um let's move from proteins to the interaction between
proteins and dna and you know we're all familiar with the the old riddle what came first the chicken
or the egg and you quote roger shapiro expert on dna chemistry in your book as saying that dna holds
the recipe for protein construction yet that information cannot be retrieved or copied without
the assistance of proteins already in the cell in other words you need dna to get proteins but
you need proteins to get dna uh doesn't this create a problem in explaining how proteins and dna
both came to exist in the first place and what does what what do scientists say about that
well it creates a vast problem because the replication of dna which is a absolutely mind-boggling process
cannot proceed without the prior existence of a number of other proteins already in the cell
now robert shapiro who's a world authority on dna chemistry he points out that proteins though they
are built following instructions in the dna are large molecules themselves that chemically
are very different from dna so the question is which large molecule appeared first proteins the chicken
or dna the egg and what is becoming increasingly clear is that it is the cell not dna and not the
proteins but the total cell that's all important which leads to the question the chicken egg question which
is is is massive is the whole thing bottom up or is it top down and i attended the quite a few of the
systems biology seminars here in oxford that were led by an absolutely brilliant um scientist uh professor
dennis noble who's a fellow of the royal society and he points out he says look genes by themselves are
dead it's only in a fertilized egg cell with all the proteins lipids and everything else inherited
from the mother that the process of reading the genome can get going at least a hundred different
proteins are involved in this without which the genome would express nothing so he adds even at the
very beginning of a new organism's life more is happening than is dreamt off in the reductionist bottom-up
model and so what he's doing here is critiquing and criticizing the reductionism that permeates
this whole system that is the idea that everything basically reduces to physics and chemistry and if
you've got the physics and chemistry there if you like in the primeval soup everything else will
follow by natural unguided processes and they're saying there is no way the very structure and
relationship between dna and the cell rules that entirely out so you have to ask a very big question
in fact there's a very interesting book by one of brazil's top biologists who's actually a christian
a very interesting writer marcus aberlin and he calls this chicken and egg circumstance causal circularity
and he points out that it's found all over living systems and he says that there's no way out of
circularity without introducing the foresight of a mind which is a very interesting way of putting it i think
that's now i found one of the most interesting chapters in your book it was all enthralling but
uh was the one on systems biology right at the end we'll come we'll come back to that but um you know
you you you point out that that the genetic information contained even in the smallest of organisms
you know viruses or bacteria is much larger than the information and the laws of physics and chemistry
you say that scientists have failed to give any plausible yet alone convincing explanation of the
origin of that information and and you you add that the only source we know of the kind of language
type information that we see in a living cell encoded in dna and rna is actually mind not not matter
do you want to unpack that a bit more for us well as you said it's not simply i who said and think
of francis crick uh who unraveled the dna molecule he once said that the origin of life seems almost to
be a miracle so many of the conditions were which would have to be satisfied to get it going
and i once met his colleague james watson and i quoted this to watson and i said what's your take on this
and he got very angry and he said well it happened and he turned around and walked away
it's very interesting this that it raises such big questions and i think the short answer to your
question and the only answer to your question peter is we just do not know the really top people say
they don't know that francis collins for example who was led the human genome project
he was very open about it and he said at the present time we don't know no current hypothesis comes
but it's close to explaining how in the space of a mere 150 million years the prebiotic environment
gave rise to life and you mentioned specifically the laws of physics well they're not a good candidate
hubert jocki one of the pioneer writers in information theory and actually also a christian
uh with together with dean overman who is also a christian said look by definition a law of nature
is a short algorithm life requires much more information than contained in these laws and for example
the genetic information and even the smallest living organism is much larger than the information
contained in the laws and they made the interesting point that if we think that the laws of physics and
chemistry will explain life's origin we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope but the most
interesting writer on this and i really recommend to all of you to watch the pascal lectures by professor
james tour tour tour of rice university in houston he is regarded as one of the world's top synthetic
organic chemists and here's his verdict he's done a lot of work on origin of life and his verdict is
based on what we know of chemistry life should not exist anywhere in the universe
life's ubiquity on this planet is utterly bizarre and the lifelessness found on other planets makes
far more chemical sense and even paul davis with his colleague in arizona sarah walker
says look in our view an explanation of life's origin is fundamentally incomplete in the absence of and i
regard this as important in the absence of an account of how the unique causal role played by information
in living systems first emerged we need to explain the origin of both the hardware and software aspects
of life or the jobs only half finished explaining the chemical substrate of life and claiming it as a
solutions to life origin is like pointing to silicon and copper as an explanation for the goings-on inside
a computer and i think that absolutely gets it it's not a question of matter it's a question of information
and of course information is not material it's carried on material so this is one of the things that
leads me to think that the whole philosophy of materialism is doomed because of the discovery within
science of information and its function within biology
now that that analogy with software and hardware is very interesting and you know perhaps the software
if you like is the dna code the program and and the hardware is the structures which it requires to
to work to work and i want i want to just move from amino acids dna and proteins now to the cell
or you've already uh alluded to this but uh you you quote michael denton geneticist as saying
that the gulf between the non-living world and the living world he says represents the most dramatic
and fundamental of all the discontinuities of nature he says that the tiniest even of bacterial cells
is a veritable micro miniaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of
intricate molecular machinery made up altogether of a hundred thousand million atoms far more
complicated than any machine built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world
and and i guess the question there is what evidence is there that the first cells arose spontaneously
at as a result of random physical processes as opposed to being the product of intelligent design
you know whatever the mechanism none that i have ever seen that's convincing now michael denton by the way
gave you your title for this webinar evolution a theory in crisis and i know michael denton the he
is from your country i believe new zealand but michael still thinks that evolution is a theory of crisis
as of 2022 so he feels that the evidence is even stronger and you can add to what you just quoted
the staggering fact that each of the approximately 37 trillion cells of the human body performs each of
them millions of operations each second now the major to directly go to your question the major problem
is the one we've already covered it's the language like structure of dna that natural processes and
particularly random ones do not produce language but if they had which nobody like denton believes
you would expect that cells have shown some kind of sequential evolution through past time but he says
there's very little evidence of that in fact molecular biology has demonstrated that the basic design of
cells is the same in all living systems essentially the meaning of the genetic code is virtually identical
the size structure and component design of the protein synthetic machinery is practically the same
in other words he sums up by telling us that no living system can be thought of as being primitive
or ancestral with respect to any other system and here's the clincher nor is there any
not the slightest experimental hint of an evolutionary sequence among all the diverse cells on earth
it just seems that the bewildering complexity now i think i need to say this
we need to be careful with the word complex the living cell is complex if i pick up a stone it's complex
but the difference between the two is that although the stone might be a crystal and exhibit certain
symmetric symmetry properties it's still very simple it doesn't
show any of the complexity associated with language that is a different sort of complexity it is semantic and
that's what we're dealing with we're not saying look intelligence is demanded by complexity
on its own it's demanded by specified complexity that is linked in with the language whether it's the
language of dna or its ordinary language if i look at the logo on this webinar icmda i see there are five
letters and i see the symbol of a cross and i know immediately from those five letters and the symbol
that there's intelligence behind that whatever processes have been involved in producing it
we recognize that from five letters plus a cross let's say seven strokes or eight
three points uh four billion letters in the right order and people will just throw their hands up
and say well that's chance and the laws of nature it's sheer nonsense whenever we see
language we instantly infer not downwards to the laws of physics and chemistry but upwards to mind
the mind yeah now uh just to change uh tack again john you've talked about the lack of evidence for any
sequential change among cells in all living human beings whether it's human being uh all living things
whether it's human beings or or viruses at the other end but let's go more macro now and and darwin
predicted that the fossil record would vindicate his theory of evolution by showing his myriad
transitional forms amongst extinct species and we often hear the argument that the fossil record
proves the theory of evolution you know the coelacanth fish and and so on what what does the fossil
record really tell us about uh the evidence of sequential change uh among more complex species
well i asked the paleontologists who are the experts on this and one of them was the
david rope in chicago's museum of natural history and some years ago he said we're now about 120 years
after darwin and we know a lot more about the fossil record we've got a quarter of a million fossil
species but the situation hasn't changed much and now i quote the record of evolution
is still surprisingly jerky and ironically we've even fewer examples of evolutionary transition that
we had in darwin's time and more recently stephen jay gould who had no sympathy with the idea of an
intelligent god behind the universe said the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record
that exists as the trade secret of paleontology now when i first came across that i found it amazing
and then i came across his colleague niles eldridge and he admitted this which astonished me
he said we paleontologists have said that the history of life supports the story of gradual
adaptive change in other words evolution knowing all the while it does not
and so my brief answer to your question what do we make of this is well the fact that leading thinkers
such as those i've cited and there are many others publicly expressed concerns about it shows at the
very least that the fossil record doesn't give the support to neo darwinism that many people think it does
can we move john onto the the mechanisms of evolution and um i think it was you quote george gaylord simpson
famously saying that the product of a mindless and purposeless pro that human beings are the product
of a mindless and purposeless process which did not have us in mind and the of course the fundamental
tenet of evolution at the macro level is that the biological complexity and variation we see
in the natural world came about as a result of genetic mutation natural selection and genetic drift
those are the three uh mechanisms and and of course very few people who know anything about the science
would doubt that evolution exists at least on a micro scale darwin's finches the peppered moths
the development of antibiotic resistance and bacteria and so on but i know you're very skeptical about
the evidence for macro evolution as opposed to micro evolution in other words that the gene mutation natural
selection and genetic drift could produce new body structures new body plans and the like what what why your
skepticism about that because that's really the heart of of darwinian evolution isn't it natural selection
it is indeed and what i've discovered with great interest is that that skepticism is very much
increasing among biologists for example geert muller who's a brilliant theoretical biologist in vienna
one of the world experts on what's called evo devo which is a theory that integrates evolutionary theory and
developmental biology he says this he says that selection has no innovative capacity it eliminates or
maintains what exists the generative and ordering aspects of morphological evolution in other words
producing new body plans etc are thus absent from evolutionary theory now that's almost a revolutionary
notion because it's going right in the face of the dawkins type um talk about evolution the late william
provine provine he on the same thing he says having and he was not a theist having natural selection select
is nifty why because it excuses the necessity of talking about the actual causation of natural selection
such talk was excusable for charles darwin but inexcusable for evolutionists creationists
have have discovered our empty natural selection language and the quotes actions on quotes of natural
selection make huge vulnerable targets now that led somebody as famous as the late lynn margoulis
saying that to say that neo-darwinism sates intellectually cura sates intellectual curiosity with abstractions
bereft of actual details so there's this increasing swell and there's a lot more evidence for this
that natural selection yes is responsible for variations we can observe it and darwin did so brilliantly but
it doesn't tell us anything about innovation
and it's this gap isn't it that uh where is the creative power coming from i i think someone explained it by
saying that that evolution may explain the survival of the fittest but it doesn't explain the arrival
of the fittest how how you can get as i say new structures body plans and and so on uh out of just
these three mechanisms of genetic mutation natural selection and genetic drift it's a yeah that that's
right i like that quotation because i think it's precisely right and i get the strong impression that
biologists are coming uh now to see it you see james shapiro is now one of the world's leading uh biologists
and here's what he says the dna record definitely definitely does not support the slow accumulation of
random gradual changes transmitted by restricted patterns of vertical descent in other words
micro evolution building up to macro evolution he goes on to say this
little evidence fits unequivocally with the theory that evolution occurs through the gradual
accumulation of numerous successive slight modifications as darwin said clear evidence does
exist for abrupt events and it's very interesting to me that one of the neglected figures in the whole
history of this which is alfred russell wallace who really is and should be much more credited with
as being the co-discoverer of the darwinian what's called the darwinian account of evolution he felt back
then that there were limits to what could be accomplished by what they observed even though
they knew and darwin knew absolutely nothing about the gene drift and and mutation they knew absolutely
nothing about that at the time and in much more recent years uh mathematician john maynard smith was a
famous darwinist and with one of his colleagues he says that there is no theoretical reason that would
lead us to expect that evolutionary lines would increase in complexity with time there is also no experimental
evidence that this happens and a lot of experiments have been done to that indicate that there do appear to
be measurable limits to what microevolution can do uh lenski and his group uh showed that e coli bacteria
still e coli after 60 000 generations of breeding in the laboratory so there are people who are seriously
doing experiments to determine what are the limits and one of the most famous of biologists uh said that
there appears to be what he called genetic hemeostasis even living things can only go so far
but innovation well obviously it must come from somewhere else
fascinating because that my next question was was going to ask you whether research had shown any
evidence of a limit to what the mechanisms of microevolution can achieve essentially gene mutation and
natural selection and you're saying with that example of e coli that that uh change happens within very
narrow limits that that's right and i would recommend if people want to follow this up there's a very
interesting book called the edge of evolution by biochemist michael behe and he refers to malaria
uh research on malaria uh shows very interesting results in this direction and supports that thesis
that there is an edge there are limits and science can determine them they're not limits we guess so we
have to go elsewhere because we do know that there are very different kinds of body plans and and so on
in nature
now john at heart you are a mathematician you're a professor of math mathematics and uh richard dawkins in
his book the blind watchmaker one of those books that many know more by title than having read but he
uses this illustration of uh a monkey typing at a typewriter and and saying that a monkey typing
randomly randomly and granted long life a very long life and with unlimited supplies of paper and endless
energy could eventually type up one of shakespeare's sonnets or even a whole book purely by chance so
you've been very critical of this argument and and i wonder if if you could tell us why uh from your
experience of mathematics make some comments about the mathematics of evolution and particularly the
the the the dawkins example i think he talks about the sentence he thinks it is like a weasel from
from shakespeare that uh he thinks any monkey get enough time and paper and energy would eventually get
it well that's not quite right and that's what's interesting about it that even dawkins i believe has
totally given up the idea that evolution in his view is purely by chance because
if you concentrate on the first part of your question monkeys given unlimited time and all this
kind of thing it's very easy to calculate that that's just absurd fred hoyle again uh brilliant math
petition um says that the reason that troops of monkeys thundering away at random and typewriters
couldn't produce the works of shakespeare because the whole observable universe is not big enough to
contain the necessary hordes of monkeys and he says similarly the likelihood of the spontaneous formation
of life from inanimate matters is one to a number with 40 000 knots after it and he adds that i must quote
this it's lovely it's big enough to bury darwin and the whole theory of evolution um there was no prime
evil soup this is fred hoyle and if the beginnings of life were not random they must therefore have been
the product of purposeful intelligence and he summarizes all this by saying well as common sense would
suggest the darwinian theory is correct in the small but not in the large rabbits come from other
slightly different rabbits not from either soup or potatoes where they come from in the first place
is a problem yet to be solved now your mention of the phrase me thinks this is like a weasel
modifies this whole thing because realizing that you can't get it by chance dawkins now says
that evolution involves random elements but it's not purely random so his famous attempt to reduce those
probabilities to manageable sorry increase the probabilities to manageable terms he had the idea
that the monkeys are typing but there's a head monkey watching them and when they get a correct letter
like the first m the head monkey presses a switch and that thing is held and of course you then get the
whole uh phrase quite rapidly and he said there you are that's how it's done but it's laughable actually
as many people have pointed out that the very thing dawkins hates that is intelligent input is precisely
what's built into his machine right from the very beginning there's a target phrase but he says that
evolution has no target there's a head monkey that recognizes the phrase recognizes when a monkey has
hit a letter and is able to focus it it's absolutely absurd and i have laughed many times but what worries me
peter is that people thought this was a brilliant solution when really it's a wonderful illustration
of subtly introduced intelligent design and into the system
um john we're almost out of time and um i just have one last question for you i said i'd come back to
the the uh the whole matter of systems biology and and chapter 19 of your book outlines some
of the exciting developments in the burgeoning field of systems biology and you cite in particular
nobel laureate barbara mcclintock who demonstrated that an organism could actually modify its own genes
known in in in complete contradiction of established darwinist wisdom can you tell us a little bit just
briefly about about that and what challenges it's created for the theory of evolution i think this is
coming back to your whole question of is it bottom up or top down and you were very much leaning to
to top down well it's probably both bottom up and top down but mcclintock is very interesting and
you know i'm into my 80th year this year and the year i was born and this is uh important because it
tells you how long ago this was noticed barbara mcclintock made a startling discovery that segments of the
maze uh chromosomes a plant could switch places on the genome this is now called the jumping gene and
this so alarmed the the darwinist world that she was essentially persecuted she got so opposed by the
scientific establishment that in 1953 she felt she had to stop work but in 1983 she got the nobel prize
in physiology for the discovery of what are now called mobile genetic elements now the interesting
thing is peter you have a namesake who is a very well-known theoretical biologist peter saunders
and peter saunders works with a man a geneticist called mai wan ho and in 1979 that far back
he they published a paper that says that the basic neo darwinian theory based on natural selection
random mutation does not adequately account for evolution who thinks that the quotes the modern synthesis
has got to be completely replaced and unfortunately he says those people who are very attached to neo
darwinism won't look at the evidence life is achingly beautiful and creative he adds once you free
yourself from the mind-numbing shackles of neo darwinian dogma now that's a hugely strong statement and mcclintock's
work has been built on particularly by a colleague at oxford the physiologist dennis noble who i mentioned
earlier and he building on ho and saunders has made groundbreaking advance in further elucidating the
epigenetic dimension that is the thing that goes beyond just the structure of the genome and dna
dna this led to the founding of what's called the third way of evolution and it's worth looking up
the website and the website says the dna record does not support the assertion that small random
mutations are the main source of new and useful variations we now know that many different processes
of variation involve well regulated cell action on dna molecules and there's the top down and amazingly in
2016 this work was recognized to the extent that the royal society organized a special meeting for 300
scientists and the title was new trends in evolutionary biology biological philosophical and social science
perspectives and noble has been very um outspoken and i quoted earlier dna on its own does absolutely
nothing and he adds until it's activated by the rest of the system through transcription factors markers
interactions with protein so on its own dna is not a cause i think he says it's better to describe dna
as a passive database which is used by the organism to enable it to make the proteins that it requires
there's the chicken and the egg with the vengeance and other workers have added to that dna does not
contain a blueprint for building the entire cell but instead contains only small parts of a much larger
biological algorithm that may roughly be described as the epigenetic components of an organism now this
is very interesting what we're saying here is that there is a vast level of complexity simply at the
level of the genome and the dna molecule but on top of that there is for example the fact that the
proteins fold there's information contained at all kinds of different levels and
in the same form of complexity is that it's not a part of the universe but the fact that the
music of life biology beyond the genome and he says look the human genome has roughly 30 000 genes
imagine it like a huge pipe organ with 30 000 pipes now he says to think that the genome completely determines the organism
To think that the genome completely determines the organism is almost as absurd as thinking that the pipes in a large cathedral organ determine what the organist plays.
Of course, it was the composer who did that in writing the score, and the organist himself who interprets it.
The pipes are his passive instruments until he brings them to life in a pattern that he imposes on them.
Just as multicellular organisms use the same genome to generate all the 200 or so different types of cell in their bodies by activating different expression patterns.
And I come into this and I want to ask, what or who is the organ player?
And what I believe in concluding this on this point, Peter, is this.
All of this development in biology confirms in my mind that this is a word-based world.
Hans Christian von Beyer, who was very interested in information, coined the phrase, in the beginning was the bit.
I think he got it almost right, because I believe that the right way of looking at this is, in the beginning was the word, the statement at the beginning of the fourth gospel.
In the beginning was the word, all things came to be through the word.
In other words, the biblical perspective is that the word information is primary and mass energy are derivative.
That's exactly the opposite way round from the standard atheistic evolutionism that is being pumped out at a great speed today.
But it makes far more sense now scientifically, not just theologically.
Fascinating.
And you brought us right back to John 1, 1, haven't you?
In the beginning was the word, and the word was God.
I remember Professor E.M. Blakelock at Auckland University, a fine evangelical Christian, speaking on this and saying that one of the best translations of Logos, the word, was an intelligence expressing itself, an intelligence expressing itself.
And of course, we quoted St. Paul earlier, or alluded to Romans 1, where he says that since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.
And you've put a lot more flesh on those bones today and whet our appetites about such things as epigenetics and the chicken and the egg and so on.
So thank you so much, John, for your time, your wisdom, being with us today.
May God bless you all.
Thank you.
Thank you, too.
Thank you.
