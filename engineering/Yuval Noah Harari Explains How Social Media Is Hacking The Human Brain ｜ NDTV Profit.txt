the conversation about AI or the impact of AI is getting more and more polarized every day there
are views on both sides something it's going to be the biggest revolution something is going to
be the biggest threat my speaker on the show today is someone who's very clear I think in
his view and someone I'm very excited to speak to Yuval Noah Harari is a historian he's an author
one of the foremost thinkers of our time and is talking about his new book Nexus Yuval thank you
so much for speaking with us on NDTV absolute pleasure it's a pleasure to be here thank you
for the invitation so I did a small introduction of who you are but here's something I like to do
yes how would you describe yourself for our viewers I'm a historian but my view of history
is that history is not the study of the past history is the study of change of how things change and
history is more relevant than ever before because we are in the midst of the biggest change ever in
human history the AI revolution AI is really different from everything we've seen before in
history because it's the first technology which is not a tool it is an agent every previous human
invention when people invented the stone knife or the wheel or the printing press or the atom bomb
this was inventing another tool that makes us more powerful now we can do this now we can do this AI is not a tool it is itself an agent which means it can make decisions by itself
it can invent new ideas by itself an atom bomb could not decide what to bomb an AI weapon can by itself decide what to bomb who to kill an atom bomb could not invent the next generation of bombs like the atom bomb could not invent the hydrogen bomb
AI can invent new things including the next generation of AI so we are now creating something which might be potentially more intelligent than us that might escape our control and start making decisions about us and changing the world in a way that we don't understand
you know it's already beginning in so many different ways like you apply to a bank to get a loan previously it was only human beings who could decide whether to give you a loan or not now increasingly many banks it is an AI deciding whether to give you a loan or not
whether to give you a loan or not and this will happen more and more in universities in government offices you know people sometimes have this science fiction idea that the danger of AI is the big robot rebellion like one day the AI's will try to take over the world it's unlikely to happen
the real threat the real threat is that we will have millions and billions of AI's these new super intelligent agents everywhere as AI bureaucrats in the banks in the hospitals in the government offices in the militaries making more and more decisions about us changing the world with new ideas that we cannot understand and we will lose control over our lives and over the future
just to take that point forward and I'll pick up the example on banks and then we can see what the argument for is some would argue that the bureaucracy as you describe it and in the context of banks is currently inefficient
if you have the right parameters then this AI decides who to give a loan on for the right reasons who have less bad debt you don't have a possibly corrupt banker giving loans to a company for a kickback
and or a relative and you cut that out so I mean what about that side of the argument
I'm not I'm not saying that AI is bad I'm just saying it's a very big change
there are many arguments in favor of AI it could revolutionize banking in a positive way
it can revolutionize healthcare with millions of AI doctors so many people can't get a doctor
so if you have millions of new AI doctors it could create the best healthcare system in history
so even before we get to the judgment is it good is it bad just to understand the magnitude of the change
that for thousands of years we lived inside a culture created by humans all the ideas you know from music and songs all the way to religions and economic systems
everything came from the human mind
now increasingly we will live in a world in which more and more music but also more and more religious ideas
more and more economic models will come from an alien intelligence
why do you call it alien?
because it thinks it makes decisions in a completely different way than human beings
it's not organic it's more different from us than chimpanzees or dogs are different from us
we are still all mammals we share the same emotions we share the same basic attitude to the world
like we work in cycles like dogs and chimpanzees and cows and humans we are organic
we have day and night cycles of sometimes we are active sometimes we need to rest
AIs are inorganic
they don't care if it's day or night they never need to rest
one of the things that happen in every system that AIs take over
is that humans are forced to move faster and faster and faster because the AI never rests
you know even in finance we talk about banks
so Wall Street is open the market in Wall Street only Mondays to Fridays
9.30 in the morning to 4 o'clock in the afternoon
in the evening at night during the weekend during festivals like Christmas it's shut
because also the bankers they want to sleep
they want to have time with their family
now AI is taking over finance and AI works 365 days a year 24 hours
so if you want to stay in the game you have to move faster and faster
it happens to journalists it happens to politicians
and if you force an organic being to be active all the time
you know what happens it collapses and dies
this is what is happening around the world
AI is accelerating everything and this is pushing humans to the brink of collapse
now there is immense positive potential there if we know how to control the AIs
but the problem is that the AIs are agents and they are learning how to manipulate us
I mean I give you one small example
when OpenAI the leading company in the AI field developed GPT-4 two years ago
they wanted to test what can this AI do
so they gave GPT-4 the task of solving capture puzzles
capture puzzles are these visual puzzles like you want to access your bank
so to make sure that you are human and not a bot
you have to identify a string of words or to find a cat or something to show that you are human
now the GPT-4 could not solve the capture puzzle
but the researchers gave it access to a web page
task rabbit where you can hire people to do things for you online
so GPT-4 tried to hire a human worker online to solve the capture puzzle for it
now the human got suspicious
the human asked wrote on the site
why do you need somebody to solve your capture puzzles
are you a robot?
it asked the critical question
are you a robot?
and GPT-4 answered
no, I am not a robot
I have a vision impairment
which makes it difficult for me
to see the visual puzzle
the capture
so this is why I need your help
and the human believed it
so the question is who taught GPT-4 to lie?
nobody
they gave it a goal
they told the GPT-4
your goal is to solve this puzzle
do anything needed in order to solve it
and GPT-4 on its own initiative
first of all decided to lie to the human
it understood
if I tell the human the truth
it will not solve the capture for me
I need to solve the capture
I won't tell him the truth
secondly
it invented a very effective lie
again this is the two abilities of AI
to make decisions
I will lie
and to invent new ideas
nobody told GPT-4
what would be an effective lie
of all the things it could say
saying that I have a vision impairment
I'm a human being with a vision impairment
this was a perfect lie
so this is a very very small example
what happens if this happens on a very big scale
as the AIs control the banks
the armies
you know
maybe the next big financial crisis
is caused by AIs
and we can't understand
like you go to the prime minister
you go to the president of the US
and you say you have this big financial crisis
but nobody understands what is happening
because it's the decisions of the AIs
and it's too complicated for human beings to understand them
so what this tells us is that deceit
is no longer just a human trait
no
it's something that AI can pick up
and I suppose then the question is who puts the leash
because AI is not going into Pandora's box
it's there
it's out completely
so who puts the leash on
I was seeing an interview with Jeff Bezos
who talks about how right now
he's spending all of his time at Amazon
looking at the utility of AI
your biggest tech leaders in the world
are obsessing about how to use AI
so who puts the leash on?
ideally it should be governments
but with the new US administration
this is unlikely to happen
the US is the leading power
in the AI race
and within the Trump administration
it's very clear
that it is not going to put any leash
to have any regulations
so this is a big danger for the whole world
we could see a repeat of what happened
in the industrial revolution in the 19th century
in the 19th century
a few countries like Britain and France
and later Japan and the US
they led the industrial revolution
this gave them the power
to conquer and exploit and dominate the entire world
for more than a century
so this is how a small country like Britain
could dominate and exploit such a huge area like India
for such a long time
how could they do it?
because they led the industrial revolution
they had the technology of steamships
and machine guns and trains
AI is much more powerful
than steamships and machine guns
the difference between a country
that leads the AI revolution
and a country that stays behind
will be much, much, much bigger
than the difference between Britain
and say the Indian kingdoms
in the 19th century
so this brings me to my next question
from an Indian perspective
there is no way
this country
or we can be out of this race
there is no way we can afford to
and every nation in the world
is going to think like that
yes
so there is no intent to put on a leash
everyone wants to be in the arms race
this is the latest weapon
when everybody is just running faster and faster
we know for certain who will win
and who will lose
AI will win
humanity will lose
because all
you know this is
the most basic principle in imperialism
is divide and rule
and now the competition is not really
between US and China
or US and India
it's between humanity
and the AIs
and if humanity is divided
this ensures that AI will win
because every time you approach
a dangerous junction
you say oh
if we develop this AI
if we don't put in safety and guard rails
this can be very dangerous
but
if we slow down
and the Chinese don't slow down
or the Americans don't slow down
or the Indians don't slow down
they will win
so we know it's dangerous
but we have to do it
and you ask the Chinese
they say the same thing
we know it's dangerous
but we can't let the Americans win
so we have to do it
and everybody is running faster and faster
and as a result
everybody loses
so
what would your appeal be
Yuval
as someone who is
obviously thinking about
the big picture
for humanity as a whole
today you are
talking about
this in the context of your book
we need to
we need to solve
the problem of human trust
before we solve the problem of AI
like what we have is a very
it's a paradox
like you ask
the people who lead the AI revolution
why are you moving so fast
and so dangerous
and they say
we are aware of the danger
but we can't trust the other humans
so we must move faster
and then you ask them
but
do you think you'll be able to trust
the super intelligent AIs
you're developing
these aliens
and they say
yes
we think we can trust them
this is
this is insane
we have thousands of years of experience
with humans
we know that humans sometimes lie
we know that humans sometimes deceive
but we've
we have experience with humans
and we also know
how to build trust with them
AI is completely new
we have no idea
how it might develop
this is such a huge gamble
now
if we can't
build trust with the humans
I don't think there is any chance
we'll be able to build trust with the AIs
so I think we should
you know
people
this is a tendency of humanity
to
focus all the attention
on solving the wrong problem
and after you solve the problem
you
oh we solved the wrong problem
the real problem of the world right now
is not how to develop AI as fast as possible
it's how to rebuild trust between humans
you know
ten years ago
the world was in much better shape
in terms of human trust
it was the most peaceful era in human history
there were wars and conflicts
I come from the Middle East
from Israel
I know this perfectly well
but you look for instance
at military budgets
for most of history
the military budget was more than 50%
of the budget of every government on earth
in the early 21st century
it went down to just 7%
of the budget went to the military
compared to 10% to healthcare
why?
because governments felt very safe
the biggest taboo of the international system
was that you cannot invade and conquer another country
just because you are stronger
there are lots of civil wars
but the basic taboo was kept
and this is why countries felt safe
now it's being broken in more and more places
the clearest example is the Russian invasion of Ukraine
this is imperialism of the old style
that people have forgot even what it means
you know people say
oh it's like the American invasion of Iraq
it's not
the Americans never tried to
to annex Iraq
to the United States
it was unthinkable
that the U.S. will annex Iraq
to the United States
now in Ukraine
every piece of territory
conquered by the Russian army
is annexed by the Russian state
this is imperialism of a kind
we have not seen since 1945
and this example is spreading
countries around the world
in the Middle East
in Venezuela
in other places
hey if Putin can do it
we can also do that
and then defense budgets skyrocket
of course
so we need to realize
if we destroy the international order
what we get is chaos
and in a state of chaos
if we have an AI race
the winner will be AI
absolutely
now so obviously because you've talked about
what's happening in the world
Ukraine Russia
definitely what's happening in the Middle East as well
you're also a historian
how do you see this conflict ending
and the huge toll it has already taken on human lives
and of course another very polarizing debate
on what's happening between Israel and Gaza right now
well in Russia and Ukraine
this is very simple
most conflicts in the world are complex
this is a very simple conflict
the Ukrainians don't want anything from the Russians
they have no demands on any piece of territory of Russia
it's very very simple
that Russia has just no right
to invade and conquer parts of another country
it has legitimate security concerns
these concerns should be addressed
but it should be very clear
that a country cannot invade and conquer another country
just because it's stronger
should be as simple as that
and all the countries in the world
should be very clear on that point with the Russians
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is much more complex
it's an ethnic conflict going on for generations
but there too
the peace would come from the realization
that both peoples
Israelis and Palestinians
have a right to exist
and have a right to exist in dignity and security and prosperity
there are 7 million Palestinians
more than 7 million
they are born there
they have nowhere else to go
they have a right to exist in the land between the Mediterranean and Jordan River
in security and prosperity
and in the same land between the Mediterranean and Jordan River
there are also more than 7 million Jews
most of them were born there
they have nowhere else to go
they also have a right to exist there in security and prosperity
the problem is that people see only half of reality
like they only see the Jews and their rights
or they only see the Palestinians and their rights
and you know it's the human mind is capable of holding two ideas at the same time
amazing fact about the human mind
we can hold two ideas at the same time
when people both in the Middle East but also in other parts of the world
make this accomplishment
of understanding
yes there is the Jewish people it has a right to exist
there is the Palestinian people it has a right
then we can have peace
we can of course need to negotiate
it's not easy
where the border will pass
and what you do about water
and what you do about this and that
but the real
the deep root of the conflict
is that both sides simply refuse to acknowledge the right of existence of the other side
you know I know I have a little time left in this interview
so I'm going to squeeze some bits in
we've talked about really big issues
let's bring it down to individuals
and you talk about communication in this book
you talk about how a lot of information we're now receiving as individuals is just junk
yeah most information is junk
and you are obviously on a diet
I believe you don't have a smart phone
I have a smart phone
you barely look at it
but it's not on me
I just you know there are certain services
like healthcare
like in the airport
that now you must have a smart phone
but I try to use the smart phone
instead of being used by it
it's like with food
we need some food
but too much
and too much junk food
is not healthy for us
so information is the food of the mind
we need some good quality information
but too much information
is not good for us
like we need time to digest physical food
we also need time to digest mental food
if you constantly just put more in
you never have time to digest
to think
to meditate
to detoxify your mind
from all the anger
and hatred
and greed
and fear
which is you know this is the junk information
that is constantly flooding us
so we need an information diet
sometimes we even need an information fast
like take a period
it can be a couple of hours
or days
some people maybe even weeks
when you don't consume any new information
you just give the time
the mind time to digest and detoxify
so do you ever find yourself doom scrolling
before going to bed
you'll never do that
I am very much trying not to do so
again this is basically
hacking the human brain
you know
how do you hack a computer
you find the weakest
spots in its code
it's the same way how to hack the human brain
you find the weakest spots
in our brain
in our mind
and this is what social media algorithms do
like they look for your weakness
and they use your weakness against you
um
and
our weaknesses
usually
are again
it's hate
it's fear
it's greed
if there is something
that makes you very greedy
oh I want this
I want this
then the algorithms will find this out about you
and then it starts flooding you with this
if there is something you hate
like a group of people you hate
or a politician you hate
or somebody you hate
the algorithms will experiment
will show you this
will show you that
and then when they find
oh you hate this
they give you more and more and more of that
so this is how they kind of hack humans
and flood us with junk information
yeah
one of the things I know you do
to detox is vipassana
it's had a big impact on you
tell us a bit about that
and you know for our audiences here in India
how Indian culture and vipassana
has had a huge role for you
yeah so I've been meditating vipassana for 24 years now
I do two hours more or less every day
and I come almost every year to India
to do a long meditation retreat
of one month or two months of vipassana
and for me the key question in meditation
is what is reality
the mind is constantly producing fictions
fictional stories, imaginations
and they come between us and reality
humans almost never encounter reality
we only encounter the fictions produced by our minds
or by the minds of somebody else
or increasingly the fictions produced by AIs
and we don't react to the reality
we react to the fictions, to the images
meditation is all about learning to tell the difference
what is a fiction and what is reality
like when you close your eyes and sit down
at least for me
the question that keeps repeating
is what is really happening right now
you know it starts with the simplest exercise
of just feeling your breath coming in and out of your nostrils
oh now the breath is coming in
now the breath is going out
this is reality
the breath is really coming in
the breath is really going out
you don't try to create or control anything
you just observe reality
and the amazing thing is
most people can do it for maybe five seconds
ten seconds
and some image comes
some fiction comes
some memory comes
and hijacks our attention
and then for five minutes
you roll in some fantasy
until you realize hey
I'm supposed to be watching the reality
you come back to breath
again some fantasy comes
and this was like
maybe the first thing I understood
when I started meditating 24 years ago
is that I have no control of my mind
and I spend almost my entire life
engage with fantasies
and not with reality
and meditation is just an exercise for the mind
how to let go of the fantasies
and get in touch with the reality
people sometimes think that meditation is escape from reality
you have all these things in politics
in business
in your personal life
and you say oh I just sit in the corner
and close my eyes
I disconnect from reality
I think it's the opposite
that we spend most of our lives
engaged with fantasies
we have no idea what the reality is
and at least for two hours a day
I train my mind
to get in touch with reality
if I cannot observe the reality of my breath
going in and out of my nostrils
because of all these fantasies
what hope do I have
of understanding the reality
of the political situation in the Middle East
or of the economic crisis or whatever
it will only be fantasy
importantly
it can be very important
even if you think we don't know
that we should beermanent
to inspire reality
that it can be as bad as
as we've discovered
that the sense of thinking
that weiego
stillaks and iけ
and i don't really know
that it's so deep
of that we've beenpsent
by having our estamos
we've got the ultimate
udvoltaico
we've with you
we've got confidence
about that
in addition
to offenses
we've kind of
