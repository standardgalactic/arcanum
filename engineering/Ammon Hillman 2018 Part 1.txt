In 2003, when I retired here to Gloucester, I became very interested in the old West End Theater
under the direction of Linda Robinson. At that time, Linda was putting together the production
of the playwright Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues. So she cast me as a co-narrator
and one of the vaginas. To be more specific, the angry vagina, which I actually thought was quite
intuitive of on her part. The vagina monologues originated in 1996, and basically they put Eve
Ensler on the map. They have been performed in 40 countries. They're still current. They have
inspired a phenomenon called V-Day movement, which has raised $70 million towards anti-violence
programs. Now, I learned a lot about the vagina in that experience. And coupled with a clinical
rotation in OBGYN when I was in nursing college in the early 60s, that followed by the publication
Our Bodies, Ourselves, put out by the Boston Feminist Coalition, I figured I had a pretty firm grasp
on what I needed to know about the vagina until Dr. Amin Hillman arrived on the scene. I met Amin
last summer, having read one of his many books. The one I had finished was Original Sin. Amin has
married several disciplines, including classical mythology, Greek, Latin, chemistry, pharmacology,
bacteriology. And his research has inspired documentaries that are shown on the History Channel.
And the London Times referenced Amin's work as the last wild, wild, happening in the classics.
In this time of the Me Too movement, which essentially my position is that paints women as victims,
I suggest that Amin would do a collaboration with Eve Ensler and take the monologues to a new level,
bringing the vagina back to a new level, bringing the vagina back to the classics.
I'm happy to introduce, friend, a veritable scholar, Amin Hillman.
I hope to be able to live up to the standard that you've set down. I wanted to just start by saying
I don't want to waste anybody's time. I wanted to thank, and I did thank Mr. Farini outside for
rearranging his schedule so that he could be here. It's very important to me. In Polis is this,
the poet he sees it as invoked, as if the filmmaker was somehow a guardian of his tomb
and was there to watch and keep it and perform some sort of necromantic right to raise him from
the dead. So I feel like I've come in the company of decent people, and I want to thank you for having
me and allowing me to address you. It's funny that you introduced me the way you did, Susan, because
my notes follow yours. I was going to mention The Last Wild Frontier of Classics, specifically because
I want to bring you back an artifact from antiquity, and I want to bring back some of the one of the
natives for you to see and to observe. That's the mission that I have right now. My name is Amin Hillman,
David Charles Amin Hillman. I went to Special Projects, a CIA and military recruiting school that
most of our students went to, one of the military academies of the CIA. I was recruited for West Point,
was working with John McCain, volunteering, that is, for the sake of an assistant, for the sake of
a nomination. And I say the name John McCain would do reverence because my, I am the, I am the, one of my
ancestors was Harry Hanson in the Fifth Cavalry. And this is the only thing personal I will say tonight
that maybe will show you something about why I'm approaching the research the way that I am.
Again, I don't want to waste your time. But Harry Hanson was with the Fifth Cavalry, and to make a long
story short, he guarded Geronimo on the prison train from Arizona to Florida. The only story that was
passed on about this interaction to my family was that Geronimo was being treated like a dog.
And Harry didn't like it, so he did the only thing he could do and shared his tobacco with him.
That small act is, embodies the passion of the research that I do, and I hope that that will come
across and you can see that. The reason I'm here, the real reason I'm here, you have to understand the
path that I took, as Susan said. So bear with me, please. I dug it, tell Megiddo, after a bachelor's degree,
uh, because I decided not to join the military, although I had the, uh, nomination. I decided that
Latin, for some reason, and Greek, were more important to me. Fortunately, after digging at
Tel Megiddo with the Chicago team, we were able to unearth a Canaanite floor, which was probably the most
spectacular and awe-inspiring moment of my career. And the reason it's so awe-inspiring is not because
it was an old object, but because it was a circular performance space for priestesses who wielded power
power. And formed the basis of Western thought. I lived in the Jezreel Valley at the palace of Jezebel and Ahab.
And in the morning, I would watch the sunrise over the vineyard of Naboth,
a man who was, came to an awful end. After the time that I spent in Megiddo, I decided that
my Latin and my Greek were growing strong and I could access the text. But what I really needed to do
was to look at the science because the science called me like a muse because of the structure and
organization and pure mathematics. So I joined an animal sciences lab and I taught and worked in a
neuroendocrinology research project where we were trying to isolate and identify
AGD, anti-gonadotropic decapeptide. We, the applications of this were, it may have helped to
stop, if we could isolate it, find where it was and what cascade of, was happening between the
hypothalamus and the pituitary, what chemical cascades, neurochemical cascades were happening,
we might be able to stop premature puberty. My job was to assist in
hypophysial portal cannulation, a process whereby you drill into a brain into the third ventricle,
which is the well of the brain. It literally is a well that holds the fluid that bathes everything that
causes us to think. We would add chemicals to it and then see what those chemicals did.
I would collect the brains and slice them, microtome, use osmium tetroxide, one of the most toxic
substances known to man, to stain those cells. I had to take an entire class just to be certified to
use the osmium. At this time, Dr. Frank Romer from the classics department approached me and said,
how's the brain cutting going? I said, it's going well. He's a classicist and he said, look, Mr. Hillman,
I know that you set yourself a foundation in classics and now you're over here in the sciences.
There's a bridge between the two and it's ancient medicine. He explained to me that we have
hundreds and hundreds of pages of untranslated texts in both Greek and Latin.
To me, that sounds incredible. And I asked him, why are these untranslated? Well, because it's technical
and it's difficult to understand. You may have a window into that area. So to make a long story short,
I followed that path and I went to the University of Wisconsin with Dr. John Scarborough, who was
himself a medically trained professor. And what I found was a world, and that's why I say frontier,
that I had never seen and a world that I hadn't seen in published in secondary form. There were no
secondary texts that talked about this world, this frontier that I was seeing. So when I presented it
at conferences, that's why the Times said that, because they were present and realized that the
frontier was being exposed. I'm very happy to do it. But in the process, I wrote my dissertation on Roman
pharmacy and was told in order to, that I wouldn't be passed if I did not remove, it was an entire
dissertation on Roman pharmacy in general. And I was told to remove the chapter on recreational drugs
and any references to recreational drugs throughout the text in order to get my degree. After having
read all this material, I was flabbergasted. So I went ahead and redacted the text, published it with,
took the material and then published it with St. Martin's in the book, The Chemical Muse. Of course,
this got me a black eye. And I was, it was in the press and the university didn't come out looking
positively, but the reaction was for me to be somewhat blacklisted.
The comment that I was given by the head of the department of the dissertation was,
they just wouldn't do such a thing. I asked her about all of the texts and about all of the medicine
that I had read and all the pharmaceutical texts. They're literally, Galen alone has more
untranslated texts than Homer, Virgil, Aristotle, Plato, Ovid, Catullus, combined,
untranslated, untranslated.
So I asked myself, if they just wouldn't do such a thing,
what are these things that they wouldn't do?
And this will bring you to the sources, the fountains of the information. And I know this,
stay, stay, stay with me because I'm about to get to the vaginas.
I enjoy, I enjoy reading and researching the sources that aren't typically acceptable sources
due to the content. Because once I was told you can't publish an idea because they just wouldn't do
that. I, I took it up as my quest to publish about those things in order to force people to look at them,
in order to create a picture of the ancient world that didn't have a lens between us and it,
to see it through their eyes. And the only way to do that is to take you back to the actual
people themselves. And so that's what I'd like to attempt to do. And I'd like to start that
with an artifact. I'd like to introduce you to an artifact from antiquity.
It's called the alabastron. And it is a medical applicator that is shaped like a penis and was used
by priestesses to apply compound drug prescriptions that they had researched in the course of women's
health. These priestesses developed a system of pharmacology that can, I describe as polyvalent.
The idea is you take a drug or a group of drugs derived from plants or animal sources
and you mix these drugs inside a human body. The human body then processes the drugs
and you derive a secondary set of drugs which can then be administered to patients or initiates.
There is no, let me step back and remind you that there is no clear distinction in antiquity
between medicine and religion
and science, what we call science. There is no distinction. Medicine, religion, cult performance,
medicine, pharmacology. These are all a single entity in the ancient world. And the alabastron
or as Sir Richard Burton called it, the leathern prick
that was anointed with medicines and then applied in order to
to not only elicit and improve health but also to create enlightenment. Now there is one problem.
There is only one type of body
that can take this process that has the capacity to do this, to transform.
Oh, the other one has some capacities and I found it in the physicians. But the female body is very peculiar
to the ancients. Again, I'm trying to talk to you as if I could summon their ghosts.
They were also necromancers and got a bad rap and ended up many of them getting flayed or
killed.
If I can step back and say one comment off script.
You women in the group, if I can isolate you for a moment just to address you.
You don't know what you're sitting on.
You don't know what you're sitting on.
From the things that I've seen, I've seen a genius woman
create antidotes for snake venom
by injecting those.
And when I say inject, they didn't have injection technology, but they made cuts.
Ritual during ritual operations, they made cuts in their arms and these whips and then they would
cover the body, the wounded sections of the body with the drugs, which is very effective means.
But what's more effective in the transmission is the use of the the brilliant alabastron,
the medical dildo.
The female body is unique.
I used to teach human repro at the University of Arizona, just as a grad and a student and
in the process of learning about
how the brain works, you realize that there's this there's this thing called
neuro endocrinology.
And all that means is there's a fancy way of saying the brain's way of regulating your body.
It's the control of your body.
And in these
control
pathways, these chemical pathways that cascade in your brain
and that cause neurons to act or unact, to silence them.
These chemicals are the control mechanisms of you, of your person.
But in the female, they are creative.
Let me give you an example.
Viper venom was used by the echidna priesthood.
Echidna is a viper.
It's the Greek word for viper.
And the echidna priesthood would vaginally apply eos venom in order to create the eos mystery.
These are priestesses.
And in the eos mystery,
the priestesses would develop an immunity to the viper venom
and the capacity to administer breast milk that acted as an antidote to the viper venom.
As a biochemist, that is sheer genius.
And that was developed by the feminine mind and the feminine body.
That's what's being hidden from you.
Not intentionally.
Perhaps out of ignorance.
And willful ignorance.
But that's what's being hidden from you.
Now I want to tell you about one of the pioneers that pushed the process of creating chemicals
that would respond to the human body or to the female body
in a way that would facilitate religious activity.
Because remember, you don't go to a hospital and sit in a bed.
You go to a temple where you're treated by professionals
who grow their own and harvest their own venoms, toxins, poisons,
and they're using everything.
The stories I could tell you from scorpion and spider venom
to every snake known to them to beaver perianal glands.
They would harvest the perianal gland of European beavers.
Process it and create an antidote, a medicine, excuse me, a treatment for headache.
It turns out the beavers were eating willow bark.
And basically they were, the Greek and Roman physicians were creating aspirin.
That knowledge, that pool of knowledge comes from a feminine source
that is tagged with the fingerprint of the feminine body.
None of this can be done without the uterus.
None of this can be done without the ovaries.
And the funny thing is, when you get down to these texts and you pull out
what these authors are doing and what the poets are talking about
that the priestesses are doing in their rituals,
when you pull out these chemicals,
you can see the fingerprint of the feminine reproductive system,
both in the cult and in the medicine that's functioning within the cult.
What's the time period that we're talking about?
Late Bronze Age.
You all think that Hippocrates was the father of medicine, right?
Hippocrates was born 600 years after the true founder of Western medicine,
whose name was Medea.
And immediately most of you poets will think Medea is a fictional character.
No, Medea was an historical queen who was so popular
that an entire ethnic group changed their identity to be called Medes
in order to honor her.
She was the inventor of a weapon called Naphtha.
The Greeks used it in their military, in their navy, to burn ships.
She used it in medicine to perform what they called breathing the fire,
which apparently nobody could do but her
because the medicine was specific to the specific body.
Not anybody can do this.
It requires a unique individual.
Alexander the Great used Medea's fire
on an actor
just to see if it worked.
They took the fire and they put it
all over his face and shoulders.
Unfortunately, he got too close to a flame
and he was burned very badly.
You don't have to, because it produces its own fumes,
you don't have to have the flame directly on the medicine.
You just have to have it near it.
And the process of bringing the flame is called
calling down the flame from Uranus.
From heaven,
which is a terrible translation,
but from the vault.
And you may have heard this expression
in a slightly different way
if you've looked at the,
what we call the Old Testament,
because another famous woman, Jezebel,
was involved in a contest
with the prophets of Jehovah.
Jehovah's prophets managed
to call down the fire.
And Jezebel's prophets were all murdered.
What we think is miraculous.
What we have historically is genius.
What else did Medea do?
And why should she be given
the ability to rise here?
I think perhaps the most important
act that she performed
for the sake of the flow of history
was to create
a form
of religion
in which
the woman's voice
was put
side by side
with the woman's body.
Yes, she colonized places
all over the place.
She's in Italy.
They worshipped her in Italy
as Angitia.
They built a temple
to her.
That's a fancy way of saying
they set up a hospital.
Because when she arrived,
one of the locals
had been bitten
by one of the marsh snakes.
He was a Martian.
And she
gave him an antidote
and healed him.
Whereas up until that time,
apparently,
most of the people
had been dying
from these marsh snakes.
So they created
a kingdom for her.
They put her
on a pedestal.
She did this
throughout
the ancient world.
She was in Corinth.
You think
she killed her children.
There are ancient sources
that say,
no, no, no.
The Corinthians
killed her sons.
I then suffered
a plague,
sent an ambassador
to the oracle
at Dodona.
I believe it was Dodona.
And asked,
what do we do?
And they said,
build some sort of monument
to Medea's sons
and set the record straight.
And the plague
will go away.
You can track
her movements
all over,
all over
the Mediterranean.
But I,
I think what I'll do
is I'll save
her additional
accomplishments
and there are many
for
questions afterwards
and I'll proceed
with,
how are we doing
on time?
Are we,
are we good?
Okay.
Does anybody have
any pressing questions
at this point?
I just want to make sure
that we're all
following the same train.
Is it clear
what I'm studying
and how I'm doing that?
The tools that I'm using
to do that?
The language
and the science.
Is that clear?
I'm curious about
all of your
talking about Galen
and all those
untranslated
and translated stuff.
Yes.
And was much of what
you're finding
in there?
Yes, yes.
Galen is a,
is a huge source.
As a matter of fact,
there's,
he wrote a book
called On Antidotes.
It's page after page
of the most
interesting material
known to humanity
that explains to us
concepts like
the small pills
that were used
and made
and stamped
that carried
the EOS mystery
or that carried
the combos,
the combination drugs
that were,
that had to be employed
by these physicians.
And these drugs
are,
are,
are absolutely crazy.
They're absolutely wonderful.
But let me,
Galen is a big one.
The other ones
are Nicander.
A lot of these
people are unread.
Diascorides.
Has anybody heard
of Diascorides?
Nobody's heard of these,
right?
Scribonius Largus,
another physician.
He says,
hey,
you can get
fresh liver
at the arena,
right?
For ingredients.
That's the best place
to get human liver
is at the arena.
Yes?
What is the Galen
and what is the
EOS?
Okay,
so Galen
is the personal
body physician
of the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius.
So we're talking
second century
A.D.,
roughly 180,
185.
He's really active.
And,
and Galen
made a mark
for himself
by performing
a dissection
on a pig,
a living dissection
in which he cut,
ligated,
excuse me,
ligated
the recurrent
laryngeal nerve
which gives you
the ability
to vocalize.
He ligated this
in the pig
in front of everyone.
The pig stopped squealing
and then he
undid the lickature
and the pig
started squealing.
And humanity
discovered
what nerves do.
this is the world
that they're living
and this is what
we have in the text
and this is what
we don't focus on
and that's what
I want to get to now.
Why is it
that this art
that was created
by women
for women
that put women
on a platform,
a power platform
where they could
give orders
to communities
that would follow
them,
oracles
who would give you,
we have an emperor,
we have a tyrant,
what do we do?
We have a tyrant
who is concentrating
all the wealth
in the hands
of a few
and what do we do?
These are actual oracles.
What do we do?
And the oracular response
is much more poetically
he's got to die.
And so they would.
They would kill them
based on the order
of the oracle
who has a religious authority
that stems back
to the operation
of women's health.
It's a very strange pairing
that government
and women's health
can work in unison.
But they do.
But they do.
Now,
I wanted to make sure
that I didn't leave you
with any misconception
about the difficulty
of the research.
Not because it's difficult
to look up,
but because it's difficult
to publish
because these topics
are taboo.
It's very difficult
to talk about
sexual activity
in humanities
slash classics
environments.
It's difficult
to talk about erections.
It's difficult
to talk about orgasms.
It's difficult
to talk about
administering drugs
via the anus
in rituals
in which men
are tied down.
drugs
and the reason
they're tied
is because
they're given psychotics,
drugs that induce
psychosis
in order to achieve
enlightenment
via the communion
with the goddess's fluid.
in order to get
to this place
you have to have
some advanced
chemistry.
The women
of antiquity
were not
oppressed.
They were not
shut out
of society.
they were the
builders
of society.
Feminism
should have
recognized
that the problem
is not women
who were held down
but an attempt
to destroy
the very
wisdom
that had been
produced
through the
feminine body.
and that's
where we get
to the mystery.
I promised
Richard
and Carl
that I would
not scare
you tonight.
You laugh
now.
How can
this be
applied
to us
today?
How is this
relevant to
us today?
Mary Magdalene
had her
own
alabastron.
She used
it on
Jesus
according to
the New
Testament
and according
to
nonus
a source
you've never
heard of
but is
out there
Mary Magdalene
wiped
Jesus'
semen
from her
from his
body
with her
hair
after applying
the alabastron
to him.
I am
curious
as to
the textual
problems
we have
in translating
the Bible
in any
Greek or
Latin
and why
it is
that we
have a
difficulty
answering
basic
questions
of
language
basic
questions
of language
why
does the
text
I'll give
you one
question
why
does the
text of
Mark
chapter 14
verses 51
and 52
why does
it tell us
that Jesus
was arrested
in a public
park
at 2 a.m.
with a
naked boy
when I
read that
I wanted
to find
out
why
I'm
going to
say that
one more
time
Jesus
was arrested
in a
public
park
2 a.m.
with a
naked
boy
you should
start to be
offended at
some point
unless I've
unless I've
misjudged
you
and that you
have some
special defense
of the
poetry that
you
consult
and the
dead
spirits
of the
poets
that you
resurrect
which is
your duty
to do
and somehow
you have an
immunity to
this
does anybody
offend it
at least
that I
just said
Jesus
was arrested
in a
public
park
at 2 a.m.
with a
naked
boy
don't answer
that
it's
mark
14
51
and 52
and if
you're
curious
about it
it says
twice in
the greek
that he
was naked
and it
identifies
the boy's
age
he's a
nanisco
so
I would
put him
at the
younger
end of
11
12
13
you could
argue
that he
was a
little bit
older
however
in all
the ritual
texts
where they
talk about
the naniska
she's usually
a palace
and we know
that the
palace
that's another
greek word
that transferred
itself into
latin
as pilex
we know
that that
age group
is pre
pubertal
and we
know
that they
were using
these
pre
pubertal
priestesses
to produce
anti-venom
because
everybody
understands
the genius
of what
she did
right
when she
takes the
venom
internally
she gets
it into
her blood
stream
she develops
antibodies
which are
then excreted
in her
breast milk
but the
problem is
how do you
get a
pre-pubertal
girl who's
never been
pregnant
can't be
pregnant
to breast
feed
it's
chemically
physically
genetically
well
it's not
impossible
no
it actually
turns out
it's not
how did
they do
it
because
the
viper
venoms
act on
the same
receptors
as the
hormones
specifically
prolactin
they were
inducing
nursing
of
virgins
that's
genius
so
what does
that have
to do
with
what does
that have
to do
with this
i'm going
to open
this in
one second
for the
final scare
this is the
final scare
of the
evening
but what
does that
have to
do with
the bible
and what
does it
have to do
with the
new testament
and what
does it
have to do
with jesus
arrested in a
public park
and what
does it
have to do
with the
christians
of the
late
first
second
and third
centuries
who were
being
prosecuted
by roman
officials
for rounding
up orphan
boys and
performing
rituals in
which they
stripped them
naked
oiled them
up
offered them
the temptation
of lucifer
to which the
boys would
scream out
no
away
and then
had to be
counseled
following the
process because
it was very
difficult
emotionally
by the
priests
we have
this in the
text
they talk
about this
these sexual
practices
are not
separable
from
the cult
from the
mystery cult
and christianity
is a mystery
cult
the first
person who
tried to
stop this
was paul
the apostle
he said
stop taking
the poisons
re-baptizing
people
who have
been baptized
by john
the baptist
himself
because
they were
drinking the
cup of
idolatry
was jesus
right when
he said
you'll be
able to
drink the
venoms
and not
suffer ill
what was
in the
cup that
was offered
to him
why was
why does
dracontius
tell us
in latin
excuse me
nonus
excuse me
nonus
in greek
in the
paraphrase of
the gospel
of john
tells us
that the
the cup
the cup
that's a
viper
that's a
name for
a viper
that lives
in north
africa
specifically in
libya
the priestess
is there
i'm not
joking
it sounds
crazy
the priestess
is in
cyrene
used the
venom
in their
eos
mystery
rites
and sold
it
on the
in the
roman
marketplace
actually
shipped
it to
rome
and you
could buy
it in
rome
lucan
tells us
that
you can
buy the
stuff
in rome
paul is
trying to
stop it
so let's
get to
the
let's get
to the
the big
surprise
uh
the book
of the
apocalypse
by saint
john
is a
book about
a war
between the
forces of
god
and his
lamb
and the
forces of
lady
mystery
i'm
translating
directly for
you
lady
mystery
and what
was the
charge
against
lady
mystery
what was
why was
she held
in such
contempt
by god
and his
lamb
because she
had offered
the cup
of her
own
sexual
juice
she had
offered
you may
have heard
of it
poorly
translated
in english
as the
cup
of her
idolatries
or the
cup
of her
fornication
lady
mystery
is brought
forth
by the
beast
remember
she's
carried
by the
beast
the
greek
word
there
is
theion
it
happens
to be
the very
same
word
that the
physicians
used
to
describe
their
beast
the
beast
that
brings
the
vision
of the
lady
of mystery
they
called
this
the
theriac
a
drug
specifically
meant
to
convey
mystery
to
convey
enlightenment
and the
beast
the drug
would
carry
lady
mystery
against
the
forces
of
god
and his
lamb
and
would
be
beaten
because
they
would
be
thrown
into
the
lake
of
fire
along
with
the
dragon
by the
way
just to
release
some
drama
the
dragons
and the
wolves
are
groups
of
priests
who
protect
oracles
the
romans
used
priestesses
called
the
lupi
it's
also
the
word
for
prostitute
the
wolf
that
feeds
that
breastfeeds
the
prince
you see
they
recognized
it
they
knew
the
power
lay
behind
her
it
lay
behind
her
milk
her
nourishment
they
wove
it
into
their
myth
and
what's
the
pill
that
I
should
have
given
you
at
the
beginning
of
the
talk
that
I
didn't
it's
the
words
of
John
Littus
all you
need to
know
is
he
was
a
Roman
writing
in
Greek
and
he
wrote
about
the
Etruscan
religion
that
preceded
the
Roman
religion
and
he
said
the
Etruscan
priestesses
the
what's
haste
who
practices
practice
their
art
on
the
Vatican
Hill
worshiping
Vaticanus
a
thousand
years
before
Christianity
that
these
priestesses
said
we
must
convey
to
you
trans
dimensional
ideas
that
can
only
exist
in
metaphor
and
allegory
that's
what
myth
is
the
priestesses
don't
get
confused
the
stories
are
not
stories
they
are
ritual
they
are
formula
they
are
the
mystery
you
can
see
both
in
Italy
and in
Greece
and in
the
Black
Sea
the
things
that
they're
creating
the
theriac
is the
foundation
for the
very
battle
in the
history
of the
western
world's
religions
it's a
battle
between
a
feminine
genius
and
and
a
masculine
something
John the
Baptist
I mentioned
before
and I'll
wrap up
we'll get to
questions
John the
Baptist
was known
to dress
in his
girdle
if you
read the
pagan
sources
they're
very
clear
that
the
Baptists
were
big
on
dressing
in
women's
clothing
carrying
penis
shaped
cups
that were
made of
glass
they called
it
the
vitreo
priapeo
that was an
ablative
case
but I
should have
put it in
an
nominative
that was
for you
they would
carry the
glass
penis
they would
wear
women's
clothing
and they
would take
the boys
and not
just any
clothing
they wore
the clothing
that was
sexual
the girdle
they wore
the thing
that was
supposed to
attract
the attention
to the
pudenda
the girdle
of Aphrodite
John is
wearing it
and he's
taking boys
out into
the wilderness
and I
said
it didn't
even enter
my mind
I didn't
even enter
my mind
that this
would have
a reason
or a
purpose
that he
would initiate
them in
the wilderness
baptize
them
and that
this would
have some
purpose
it seemed
like
but they
discovered
there's one
more source
of antidote
for the
venoms
that they
were using
and it
only comes
in the text
at least
it only
comes
from a
prepubertal
boy
through
his
semen
and I'm
sure it
has something
to do
with the
hormones
I'm sure
it has
something
to do
with the
fact
that he
is not
his
testosterone
level
is down
here
and that
he's
more
feminine
perhaps
so John
lost his
head
because he
converted
the right
from the
girls
to the
boy
why was
Jesus
arrested
in public
park
at 2am
with a
naked
boy
because
he was
performing
the mystery
of the
kingdom
of heaven
thank you
for having
me and
I'll
give you
questions
I'll
open it up
for questions
thank you
thank you
