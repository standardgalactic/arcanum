today is one more of those uh last five episodes of the uh it's not what they told you series it's
not just one more episode it's uh it's with someone i hold very very dear uh someone that
i consider a teacher in very interesting ways she didn't know that uh she only knew that when
i met her right now because i do spend a lot of time following her work and uh and i think she's
fabulous honestly in her outlook outlook on life in the way she analyzes topics uh and then i met her
in person and i was right so uh that's uh that's um you know it's actually quite rewarding when you
you know they say don't meet your heroes no no i'm happy with this one uh my my guest today
is uh grace uh blakeley who is an avid economist journalist uh an author uh she wrote three books
uh on the topics of capitalism and how capitalism is affecting the world her latest is vulture
capitalist which i have to say having lived in california for a while is such an you know an
appropriate title for the entire genre of venture capitalist if you want and uh and i think uh you
know in my attempt to get you to understand our world a little differently than what they tell us
our world is like uh i think grace truly was the one guest that i wanted to uh to sort of conclude our
conversations around the economy with uh so without further ado i'm going to uh enjoy my time with my
guest today thank you for being here thank you so much for that absolutely lovely introduction mo it
means a huge amount especially coming from you it's uh quite true so uh i uh no pressure okay
i'm hoping i won't disappoint you now let's see i don't think you will i i love the way that the take you
you take on the topics that you you analyze and i and i i said several times on this podcast i am a
recovering uh a capitalist uh you know in rehab basically uh because for many many many years i
believed the promise i drank the kool-aid uh you know i had many startups i basically embraced the promise
of freedom that you know if you if you think to the to the to the history of capitalism and the idea
that pre-capitalism there was only royalty and feudalism and you know there were peasants and lords
and you know everyone had to pay to work for the peasant for the lords and and the lords worked for the
royalty uh and and capitalism sort of sneaked in you know with the british empire and the trades of
spices and so on where some of the peasants somehow found ways to make money and and you know and you
sort of take that story as like this is true freedom everyone now is free uh i've then realized
actually partially through your work that that's not true at all that we are the furthest thing as as
the subtitle of your latest uh book says you know this is the death of freedom that the promise
is not at all what was delivered so that's all i will say today the rest of the episode is for you
great i'll try and take up as much time as i can no i mean it's so interesting hearing you say that
because in a lot of ways i kind of wrote the book for someone like you who was uh in one way or another
taken in by the very seductive narrative that we have around capitalism and freedom and it's a
seductive narrative in a number of ways um i think for those who succeed under capitalism it's very
seductive because the idea that we're all free and that the market sorts us into the best down to the
worst and wherever you end up in the hierarchy is a reflection of your natural talents your natural
capabilities it's seductive obviously for those at the top because it kind of legitimizes your power and
authority and wealth um and even for those not at the top the idea that the way things are is
somehow rational and justified and fair yeah it makes you almost less angry it kind of makes you
just take things the way they are and just accept them because you think oh well you know i'm not jeff
bezos or elon musk i'm not as intelligent and those people so no wonder you know i'm earning a tiny
amount of money and can barely afford to pay my rent because i'm just worth somehow less as a person
um so this narrative that we are all free we're free to shape the conditions of our own existence
we're free to work as hard as we like and if we do work as hard as we like and succeed and apply
ourselves then we will inevitably rise to the top it's seductive for a lot of people the only issue is
that it's completely and utterly not true um and the way i like to talk about this you know we're told
this i this kind of story about the way that society works is it almost being like a game
so you know you're competing against other people to win the game and the rewards are money and wealth
and power and esteem and those who are better at the game get to the top and those who are worse
you know fall to the bottom but the issue is that we're all playing this game most of us and then
there's a very small category of people who are kind of outside of the game and instead of playing the
game they're making the rules they're making the game for everyone else exactly yeah um and these
are the people who basically plan capitalist economies the institutions and individuals
who have so much power over the way that the world works that they're able to basically shape
the conditions of life for so many people and that power is generally unearned it um you know comes from
whether that's a position of inherited wealth often it comes from corruption and influence of that kind
that people are able to exert um and it allows a small number of people to undermine that idea of
freedom um and to enclose the world and shape the world in the way that they would like to to see it
and then we're all forced to play the kind of the game that they've set for us um i use quite a lot
of examples to illustrate this point um the you know this idea that we live in a free market capitalist
economy doesn't really work in practice because of all this kind of centralized planning that takes
place within these free market economies and the one i'd just like to quickly talk about because
it's very relevant at the moment is the example of the company boeing um yeah so you might have seen
boeing uh in the news quite a lot recently one of the doors blew out of its planes mid-flight
there's been all sorts of engineering issues with the company um and actually if you look back to 2018-19
there were two crashes involving boeing planes the 737 max disasters um in which nearly
100 people yeah nearly nearly 350 people died yeah um and initially boeing tried to kind of blame the
pilots uh for for both of these crashes but investigations later revealed that it had been a
software flaw that was kind of built into the plane that caused its the plane's nose to dive down and the
pilot could not really do anything to rectify the issue um and subsequent investigation from both
regulators and journalists looking into this showed that a big factor in uh kind of demonstrating why
boeing had allowed this basically unsafe plane to go to market was that it had shifted towards this um
corporate culture of basically denigrating engineering expertise lionizing senior management
inserting layers and layers and layers of management whose role it was to cut costs crush unions
kind of subjugate workers ignore whistleblowers and just deliver um cheap planes that could be sold
to boeing's various network of contracts that exists with governments all over the world not least the
american state and make massive profits and they did that they were able to achieve massive massive profits
distributed loads of money to shareholders um and it was kind of you know a classic tale of corporate greed
in which you didn't see any kind of competitive pressure from the alleged free markets because boeing
was in this position of basically kind of oligopoly power exactly yeah and equally you know you have other
people who might say oh well if the government was able to kind of step in and uh you know make the market
fairer or subject this firm to regulation then this never would have happened there's only one issue
with that which is that the government was helping boeing at every step yeah so it was one of the
biggest recipients of corporate welfare that means it got money from the government from the us state
in terms of taxes subsidies it had huge numbers of contracts with the us uh with the us state it was a
very integral part of the military industrial complex in terms of regulation at the time of these
disasters uh the airlines so the aerospace manufacturers were being regulated in the same
way as the banks in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis this is self-regulation yeah and boeing was
being regulated by a unit of the federal aviation authority that sat inside boeing and whose workers
no were being paid by boeing yes uh congress had just passed another round of deregulation for the
airline industry saying that no uh manufacturer would ever release a plane that was um you know
unsafe because it would damage its position in the market capitalism would never allow such a thing to
happen because we have free market competition and then even after all of this had come to light
and boeing was charged uh because of uh all of these failings it still got a massive backdoor bailout
during the covert 19 pandemic so that you have this kind of cabal of senior executives wealthy shareholders
politicians individuals within a powerful state um who are brought together in something like the
military industrial complex and who are entirely insulated from free market competition and also
actually quite well insulated from democracy as well so they exist in their own little bubble
at the very top able to make these massive decisions that have huge effects for everyone else
and yet we're told that we live in this free market system boeing's workers were subject to this
ruthless market yes but the executives of course you know boeing has a um a very uh um privileged not
important position let's say for the u.s economy because the competitor is airbus which is not american
which basically means that if boeing fails the u.s economy fails or the u.s position in aerospace
fails and according or commercial aerospace fails and accordingly the u the american government would
never let them fail if you want right it's very very similar to the analogy of 2008 and the big banks
right too big to fail if you want now of course the the interesting side of this is that basically it
means that we are asking the regulators we we want the government if if you want to say capitalism is
freedom because everyone can do what they can to succeed without government regulation the reagan
economics if you want the what you know what thatcher allowed to uh to to do it you know i tried to do
here in the uk or pretended to do here in the uk is basically saying hold on no regulation from the
government it's freedom for the market economy and at the same time now when we ask the government to
regulate by definition there is really none of that because the benefits are there is a conflict of
interest for the benefits so that's a very very um there is really no freedom if you want when you think
about how uh we end up in places like this so so we we we constantly hear the words around you know those
big influencers somewhere who own all the money or own all the wells who are making all the decisions
you know uh in a way that basically affects every single one of us
us how do how does that actually play in reality i mean is there really like a backdoor meeting with
where people worth less than 100 million dollars are not allowed in that meeting and the others come
together and say okay from now on we're going to start another pandemic and you know that's going to
right is that how it happens no generally not um although there are moments of generally crisis when um you do
see uh powerful people come together often in a room and make really big decisions about what happens
next so the example i always think about is um the financial crisis when um the the central banks got
together with the the heads of the major banks um and basically made a plan for the world economy
um and there was a study that was done after that that showed that those banking institutions that had
the closest links with the american state ended up doing better from the bailouts than um than those
that didn't um so you know occasionally and i think this is where the kind of conspiracy theory stuff
comes from you do see powerful people coming together and actively making those decisions in a
collective way but the vast majority of the time the cooperation is not that explicit and it's not that open
it is the subject of a kind of networked organization that allows people with similar interests to come
together to lobby and to influence politicians and political power now there's nothing inherently wrong
with that this is how democracy works you know you have different groups of individuals who organize
within civil society to make their interests known and try to apply pressure on politicians or whoever
else they're trying to pressure the issue is is that we live in a world in which only one set of
people have the ability to do that and the vast majority of people are actively denied the capacity
to organize in order to demand things of politicians and are basically repressed and and crushed and beaten
down when they try to demand things explain so um we talked about neoliberalism right about the
thatcher and reagan and they're coming to power saying we want to deliver free markets right um what's
very interesting is that the first things that neoliberal leaders do when they come to power is
basically go to war with uh any organizations that manifest collective power particularly the unions
so in the uk the first thing that margaret thatcher does when she comes to power is go to war with the
country's unions and she wins she crushes the miners who are trying to fight for their jobs hold on one
second so let's define you neoliberalism for everyone oh sorry neoliberalism in my in my understanding is
government will not regulate this is free market economics every everything happens with the freedom
and justice of free market government is a is a is a burden uh let's leave everything to nature if you
want the nature of economic free markets exactly that's so so so of course reagan on in the us that
thatcher here were basically the leaders of that idea go let's go back to the unions bit which i think is
fascinating when you really think about it no that was immensely well explained because that's exactly
how they presented their ideology exactly that's how they sold the ideology yeah exactly um and
it was really powerful i think because people bought into that idea of freedom yes exactly yeah
um but what's interesting is the um contrast between that promise of freedom which is we will
come to power and we will promote individual freedom we will give you control over your life
your pensions exactly yes and then the actual actions of these governments when they come to power
and the first thing they do as i've said is um yeah literally use the power of the state to beat back
and divide people who are organizing to try and defend their interests first on the list are the unions
so uh reagan famously goes to war with pacco in the us uh thatcher goes to war with the miners in the uk
and then all of this anti-union legislation is introduced to make it much harder for workers to
organize to defend their interests and so you see union membership decline quite substantially over
the course of the next several decades um they also uh dissolve other forms of collective power that
existed in the economy at the time so thatcher for example shut down the glc the greater london
corporation and she had been in this kind of battle with the glc because there were lots of kind of
left-wing politicians that were organizing in uh this london metropolitan authority uh to try and
do things like um you know thatcher wanted to build the london docklands right where we now have canary
wharf and all of these big financial institutions the people living there at the time said we don't
want this they actually put together a document called the people's plan for the london docklands
with the support of the glc and they said our children deserve to be more than lavatory
attendants for passing businessmen we want a different vision for this space which is where
we live um and partly because of its involvement with community organizing like that thatcher shut
down the glc so you know any form of community power that it had been helping to support was then
crushed as well um so you see these these politicians come to power and their first aim is to crush any
resistance any resistance that comes from the vast mass of ordinary people right at the same time
they deliver unparalleled freedom for those at the top so suddenly you can literally move your money
anywhere in the world because you have the removal of capital controls and exchange controls tax
especially the the taxes that have been levied on those at the very top of society um were slashed
um you saw a transformation in regulation and again this is often cast as deregulation which implies
that the state is shrinking and stepping back but that isn't what it was really like it was actually a
proliferation of regulation but regulation that benefited those at the top particularly the big banks
banks need lots of regulation because you know they need an environment of certainty banks always need to
know that ultimately if anything's going to go wrong then the state is there to bail them out exactly
so that's why regulation is important to the banking system and you got in many ways lots of new
regulation but instead of regulation to protect workers or protect the environment it was regulation
to protect the banks so what all this shows i think is that neoliberalism was never really about
freedom it was about freedom for some those at the very top and in order to protect
the freedom i.e the wealth and power of those at the top they saw it as necessary to constrain the
freedom of everyone else and particularly their freedom to organize and you see this today with
demonstrators being put in prison for years for peaceful protest this is a continuation of the same
logic which is we're putting people in jail to protect freedom whose freedom the freedom of those at the
top which is quite fascinating when you really think about it because that becomes today really the
the underlying current of everything that you see online everything that you see i mean in a very
interesting way since the reagan thatcher years individualism we spoke about this briefly before we
started becomes truly uh the dream of every now consumer not human okay the the idea is that as a as a human
now in this uh fair world where dog eats dog but dog can become very big and i can be you know jeff bezos if
i really worked hard enough suddenly you start to believe that you're competing with any everyone else
rather than cooperating with everyone else which i have to admit in my in my blurry years you know i
used to because i'm raised in the east and and and you know educated in the west i used to think that
this is something wrong with the west that individual freedom is highly prioritized above societal and
community benefit okay but but now i can get it i can get that this is an agenda that basically says
hey if all of you guys fight okay and argue and be rude to each other which now is explosive on social
media then you're never going to organize and annoy the rest of us up here in the penthouse trying to
just make a little more money here exactly i literally couldn't have put it better myself
thank you my my teacher said so where where does that put the politicians then because
interestingly you'd you'd look back at the thatcher years and say oh my god it's the best thing that
happened to the uk you know she was the politician that came and saved all of us right and you could
actually back that up with years of prosperity in the city of london if you want where so much money was
being made for so many people and so many bentleys started to show up on the street so there are signs
that things are improving was was margaret thatcher or or ronald reagan actually working for the people
were they governments of the people or governments of the elite thatcher and reagan and thatcher in
particular actually had this ingenious strategy and thatcher said the method is economics the object
is to change the soul she wanted to transform the way that people related to each other in exactly the
way that you said in the the 60s and 70s it was in some ways the peak of organizing you know you had a
strong labor movement you'd had you know um in the us the peace movement the protest against vietnam
the anti-apartheid movement that was spreading around the world and spreading through uh through
the student movement you had the environmental movement you had all of these people coming together
to make their power known and it was starting to just disrupt the operation of capitalism because
these people were gaining political power um they were you know able to um really yeah present a
threat to vested interests and neoliberalism was what undid that and it did so through a two-pronged
approach the first one was to create an ultimately unsustainable financial boom um the benefits of
which would be used to incentivize people to behave in a certain way and that's the second prong which
is this project of societal sociological and fundamentally psychological transformation
that underpins this transition which is as you said about how do we stop people from organizing
together in these movements that are threatening us and get them to start competing against one another
um and i i i'm kind of writing a book proposal at the moment that looks at this exact thing i'll publish it
great uh but the the three trends that i think were most pronounced were the shift from workers to
entrepreneurs the shift from citizens to consumers of public services and the shift from communities
to households so rather than seeing yourself as a worker as you might have done in the the post-war
years thatcher's aim was to encourage you to see yourself as an entrepreneur and an investor
um and the the reason that that is particularly beneficial is because workers organize yeah they
all have the same interests yeah often if they're not paid well they'll talk to their peers exactly and
say hey are you unable to put food on the table too yes yeah exactly and that was a problem because
these workers were coming together and they were organizing and they were saying we're not getting
paid enough so let's go on strike but if you're an entrepreneur and you know this better than anyone
you're competing against all the other entrepreneurs it's your job to um you know use your savvy as an
investor to invest in your human capital so this comes out with education education is now something
that you pay for and you take out a loan to invest in it because it's investment in capital in your human
capital wow you um you know you take out a loan to make sure that you're able to purchase your own home
and that again can provide a source of wealth that insulates you from life's risks you um again get
your own private pension and you have to invest that in the stock market and when the stock market
does well which means wealth is um increasing at the top you then think oh well wealth is being
created at the top but i'm getting a little bit of it as well so why would i resist even if your
salaries stayed the same if you have assets then you're much more likely to identify with the
interests of those at the top because of the value of your house the value of your pension is going up
then that means your interests are aligned with with those kinds of people um so that shift is is
really important and then on the flip side it's the the kind of a proliferation of asset ownership
is accompanied by this dramatic expansion of debt now debt is the key here because the unleashing of the
financial power of the banks is what brings us this boom that creates all of this prosperity this
alleged prosperity that we get from the 1980s onwards it's largely driven by the removal of
exchange controls and the removal of capital controls so money is now free to flow all over
the world and banks can now create much more money through lending than they had been able to do in
the past a lot of that lending goes into mortgages it means that you can now take out a massive mortgage
and use that to buy a home what happens when you have more money chasing the same amount of stuff
you have more liquidity chasing the same number of houses house prices go up it creates a massive
financial boom we know what happened from the 90s onwards that boom ends up taking over the whole
global economy creating massive economic growth and prosperity for lots of different people but
ultimately that was unsustainable and in the process you have this beast of debt that is released
and debt is a really powerful disciplining tool for people because you know on the one hand you might
have some assets but on the other hand you now have to manage your liabilities as well so if you're
relatively wealthy then you always make sure that you know you try and have more equity stay in your
home than than your liabilities um you kind of manage your debt and your assets you're a good kind of
mini capitalist who makes very healthy financial decisions but if you're not paid very well um you
might find that suddenly the value of your liabilities is higher than the value of your assets
um and instead of saying oh well you're not being paid a high enough wage to be able to afford the
things that you need to survive people will instead say you've been irresponsible you've made bad
financial decisions and that's how you've got yourself into debt even though they've taken out the debt
just to be able to pay for things they needed to survive so it's you internalize that you think
i'm a failure because i'm in debt you don't think i need to organize with people to try and have a
higher wage and actually today you know financial issues are driving a lot of people particularly
young men to self-harm and suicide because they internalize that blame they think because they
they look at the the the lifestyle of the top guy uh who is you know who seems to be so clever and
in a very very interesting way for men that means he's very masculine right he he managed to succeed
and become the best hunter in the tribe right and and i'm not able to do this so it's not just that i'm
not able and able financially it's basically an identity issue that would lead to that it's quite
interesting as well when you when you it doesn't matter as a matter of fact if you're gaining capital
you know in your assets that you bought in debt i think the sentence that you said there which is
so interesting is that is a very powerful disciplinary instrument so so in a you know where i grew up in
you know a developing economy you get you keep the people busy with football and putting bread on the
table right uh in in more advanced economies like here i think the idea is if you had given people
enough which was really what was happening post-world war ii with the you know baby boomers creating so
much gdp it seems that in my mind that basically meant they had so much time to start pondering
yeah stuff that could actually harm the government interestingly or the top players right or the you
know the the the ones that the government works for really and and in a in an interesting way to keep
people busy then student loans other loans mortgages car loans and everything becomes you know the the
the shackles that basically keep us uh restrained i have to say what i've never really discussed this in
public maybe we should have it over coffee but i'll ask you anyway one of my experiences which most
people have never had is i was witness because of my position at google and because of you know at the
time and because of my history of being a very prominent businessman in the middle east for a long time
so i was very much entangled into what was happening with the arab spring
um not that i had any views on it because i had not lived in my home country uh egypt for maybe 20
years at the time but you know i i'd i'd been in a position of i know the internet really well so
almost everyone was constantly reaching out to me the previous government the transition government the
you know the opposition everyone was just talking to me all the time saying what's happening
right and and i have to admit in my mind i think the arab spring seems to have been a glitch in the
system where where you know somehow because arabs at the time were so offline if you want you gave
them a tiny bit of online community and suddenly they go like this is right and and they they organize
and they explode okay and i have to say i you know i feel that leading after the arab spring into 2019
2020 there was there were start that you could see quite a bit of organized opposition around the
world hong kong here in the uk and so on and so forth and it i i don't think that this is the reason
for covet i you know i'm not into that conspiracy at all okay and i know you wrote about you know
the coveted economy if you want but it seems to me that somehow governments found a massive
opportunity to say okay everyone stay home right let's not organize in the streets anymore no more
arab spring and you could actually recognize very quickly that post-covered everyone's silent
everyone's like yeah what was that right and let's talk about that era a little bit no conspiracy theory
here but but two things happened with covet one is actually society at large was disciplined yeah
everyone was ordered to sit home nobody had freedom to add to do anything but at the same time massive
amounts of money were funneled into the system through printing money basically more debt right
uh and i think that completely shifted i think this was a you know the one big nail in the coffin of
freedom if you think about it what do you think of that i think yeah that is a very interesting and well
thought through analysis because you're right it's not conspiratorial um to say that governments in
particular but also big multinational corporations took advantage of a crisis to strengthen their
position and you see this happening over and over and over again you know naomi klein um talks about
the shock doctrine and disaster capitalism the way in which the powerful are able to take advantage of
moments of crisis and uncertainty to embed and strengthen their control uh one example that uh she uses which i
find really fascinating um is the example of the tsunami um and the crisis and devastation that
took place in the maldives and the way in which that was used to remove people who had been living
on the islands in the maldives for a very very long time settle them all in a very very small area of the
capital and ultimately sell those islands off to big hotels so that they would become centers for you
know luxury tourism basically now no you know no one's saying the government caused that natural
disaster but they took advantage of it to basically kind of redistribute power and wealth within that
economy and i think that you can say the same about the pandemic um and that that takes place both
within individual societies and at the level of the world economy now you mentioned there um you know
having uh been born in the middle east and been a businessman in the middle east for a while
and that that idea of debt as a disciplining tool resonates with you now you can see that at the
level of kind of individual consumers but you can also see that at the level of whole state
exactly of course so the name for my book vulture capitalism comes from um this uh vulture fund basically
which was just after the 2008 financial crisis zambia which is a you know relatively small african
nation big copper producer had nothing to do with the financial crisis but because of the collapse in
world gdp after 2008 copper prices fell its export revenues kind of dried up and its debts started to
look unsustainable so there was an irish fund that bought zambia's debt knowing that zambia was going to
default on that debt so that it could sue the government of zambia for failing to pay its debts
and take vast amounts of money out of the pockets of ordinary zambians and suck it back into the rich
world now this is the kind of what you might call kind of lawfare it's like warfare using international
legal systems yeah that you see all the time in the world economy and debt is a very powerful tool
for basically crushing um entire nations and particularly nations where you're beginning to
see some resistance to the dynamics of global capitalism and i think you're quite right that
we did start to see that in a really big way before the pandemic i think part of the reason for that was
that we were moving from a unipolar world into a multipolar world now you know you can say whatever you want
about the dynamics that underpin that but ultimately when you have two superpowers
all the other countries in the world economy have a little bit more leverage a little bit more room
basically because they're able to change them exactly put them put them off against each other
before it was the washington consensus which is you know you follow the rules laid out by washington
or you don't get any money and you're kind of ostracized for the world from the world economy
now these countries have more than one uh superpower to pick from they can maybe go to china if they
want lending for infrastructure that's going to come with a lot of strings attached and a lot of
problems but ultimately there is this this choice now what you see over the course of the pandemic
is a lot of nations being really kind of beaten down using the tool of debt because um a lot of
countries as soon as the pandemic hit basically found themselves unable to repay their debts through
no fault of their own the global economy had been shut down you know the factories that were using the
resources that they were exporting were no longer operating suddenly they were unable to pay their debts
we had a debt moratorium so a pause on debt repayments but the the debts themselves kept
increasing because of interest exactly yeah um and that has continued to this day except for the fact
that it's getting worse because of climate breakdown so you see you know natural disasters cyclones
hurricanes we've just seen in the caribbean recently that caused massive devastation and caribbean nations
come forward and say you know we as the international community have agreed that small island countries
countries at risk of desertification all of these problems that are going to come from climate
breakdown we shouldn't be the only ones that have to bear the burden of climate breakdown so we would
like some of these debts that we're going to have to take out to reconstruct after this natural disaster
that we didn't cause that basically you in the global north caused we're going to ask for some grace
on that debt and what they get is so tiny it's barely enough to allow them to recover let alone put in
place the conditions for sustainable long-term economic growth it's again i i will probably repeat
your sentence for a very long time it's an it's a disciplinary instrument right so so the idea of the
fact that someone can go to zambia and take out literally imagine walking into a country and taking
ten dollars out of every citizen yes when their income is two dollars a month right uh you know
how evil is that when you really think about it but that's not the issue the issue is that is used
to discipline a country so that they follow the agenda and and become a peasant as a country right
and and i think the idea of how the world bank and international monetary fund the uh you know and so
on and the imf and so on basically used that instrument in favor of western agendas uh you
know it's on it's it's not it's not a secret now i think in the last year a lot more uh truth coming
out about how many decisions globally that would benefit the entire world would be vetoed because of
western interest sometimes because of a certain nation's interest and basically that those instruments
then put the entire country and its leaders under pressure to comply yes right um the the thing that
kills me though and you repeated it several times is that thatcher would then promise freedom yeah that
reagan would promise prosperity that you know uh the the imf would promise reform that it's almost
consistent that what the promise is is the opposite of the objective that that you're walking in
to sort of break down unions and the the very very final bit of freedom that the worker has
and you're promising the the worker freedom it's it's very skillful the way they do that and i think
it comes back to what i was saying at the beginning about how alluring this promise of freedom is
and the allure of that promise comes from again it's the american dream it's like sure they're
promising freedom and that freedom is going to come with inequality it means that we're going to have a
market basically some people are going to rise to the top and some people are going to fall to the
bottom but we all convince ourselves i'm effective i'm talented i'm resourceful why should i not be able to
rise to the top and achieve things and and you know become a millionaire within this system and within
this economy i think in some ways it speaks to the fact that we all know that we as individuals and
groups have immense skills and capabilities and talents that are constantly being exploited by someone
else and taken advantage of by someone else which by the way is the actual you know definition of
capitalism it's basically you know everyone is a commodity let's just buy them for the for the
lowest possible price to produce for the capitalist exactly yeah um and because we we know that we
know that we have these talents and skills that being exploited by someone else we're sucked in by
this idea that if all the external stuff is taken out of the way then we will rise to the top the
problem is is that the whole game is rigged you know as i said there's this class of people who are
insulated from um from markets basically because they're you know in monopolies or they're working
within governments to kind of get their own way um and then even you know within this hierarchy
there's a brilliant statistic from oxfam that says that one third of billionaire wealth is inherited
and one third of billionaire wealth comes from crony connections to government so basically two
thirds of billionaire wealth comes from either inheritance or corruption so the idea of the
self-made billionaire is just kind of absurd but that other third it comes from exploiting workers
exploiting the environment you know god knows the privileges that we afford to billionaires because
we basically say well they have all the wealth we better give them what they want
and you know it just it really brings home this point that um the freedom that you're promised
is really the freedom to kind of be exploited unless you are one of those very few lucky people
who is basically able to adopt a position at the top of this hierarchy and sit around making rules for
everyone else um so i and i think um there's another point here that you mentioned earlier
which was about the implications of this for people's understanding of their own masculinity
and identity right because if you buy into this philosophy for understanding the world which is that
you know life is a market there's a clear hierarchy the capable ones go to the top and the useless
ones sink to the bottom but you aren't aware of the fact that this game is rigged that actually it's
not the good they get to the top it's the lucky that get to the top and they stay at the top or or
the the one of the team basically yes exactly if you align with the team at the top then you get to
the top yeah yeah um and people at the top never fall down to the bottom yeah that's a key thing about
social mobility it's not just that those at the bottom are able to go up if they're effective
it should also mean that if you're very wealthy and capable and you fail that you should fall to
the bottom you shouldn't be do you ever see that happening exactly absolutely not so if you don't
understand that this game is rigged you internalize those feelings of shame and powerlessness and you
think i'm not a millionaire so i must be worthless you know i've been working really hard but i'm not
succeeding that must mean that i am not intelligent that i'm not capable um and you see i think
particularly among young men today where the idea of masculinity is as you say tied to your ability to
provide to have a home to have a good salary to feel secure to be able to provide a sense of security
and you are unable to do that because we live in an economy that kind of manufactures insecurity
as a way of exploiting people you feel like a failure and your response to that could be a number
of different things it could be that you feel hopeless and depressed and that's definitely
something that we're seeing with the rise of severe mental ill health but it could also make you very angry
correct it can make you feel like you want to burn the whole system down like the only reason you're
not getting to the top is because there's people in your way it's the women the feminists or it's the
migrants and the refugees who are getting in your way which we can see so much noise around exactly
so that response to this competitive hierarchical individualistic culture that we've created
makes us sick or it makes us angry and it makes society sick and we've just seen that with the riots
that we've had across this country and and of course that's playing to the agenda of what is
the design in the first place it's like yeah let the let the you know the savages sort of you know
mingle among themselves and fight and disagree and you know and and and comment badly on each other's
social media posts let them not never get together and say it's the whole game design that's working
against me fascinating what do we do i'm glad you asked um i think you're exactly right that this
division and this individualism plays into the agenda that we're we're kind of all playing under
because the narrative of those at the top
is ordinary people are too stupid or too selfish to be trusted with any real political power
we have to have all the power up here because if we really had a democratic economy if we gave workers
power in their workplaces if we gave communities power then they would abuse it and what's the
evidence for this well it's people's response to living in a competitive individualistic society
where they're encouraged to fight one another and they do fight one another and then because they're
fighting they're fighting one another those at the top say you don't deserve power you have to be
controlled and policed right and actually there is another way so throughout history across time across
space there are constant examples of people coming together doing that thing that i mentioned earlier
of recognizing that they have these skills and capabilities that are being exploited by someone else
but instead of trying to use those skills to compete against each other they pool their
capabilities and they come together and they cooperate and they build movements or institutions
or organizations that become really powerful and influential um and the example i like to use
because i think it's a really good contrast with the example of boeing is the example of the lucas plan
in the uk now you might not have heard of this this was lucas aerospace was an aerospace company
in the uk in the 1970s um and it came into all sorts of difficulties because rising competition from
abroad the workers were unionized they were paid higher wages so it wasn't competitive
and they the workers uh went to the labor government at the time and said we need you to nationalize us
because you know otherwise the firm's going to go under and we're going to all lose our jobs but tony ben
who is my personal political hero a democratic socialist um replied to the workers why don't
you come up with a plan as to how you can save this corporation and so the unionists went back to the
workers and initially they tried to ask all sorts of experts and academics how they could design a plan
to transform this company that didn't work very well so instead they asked all the workers in in the
company you know all of these engineers all of these you know people in various different positions
throughout the company to provide ideas as to how they could change it and what they put together
became known as the lucas plan and these workers had basically taken stock of the resources within the
firm and they had said rather than producing weapons which is what they were producing at the time
they said we can use this organization to produce socially useful technologies that will be of benefit to
society so things like wind turbines healthcare tech kidney dialysis machines this was in the 1970s
so it's very forward thinking and here's a plan as to how we can get there they were saying there's
layers of management that are telling us how to do our jobs and what to do we don't really need that
we can work together and manage ourselves we can have a democratic publicly owned company where um you
know there are worker representatives making decisions where there's you know political
representation societal representation so that we can have this company that produces socially useful
technologies and this plan was greeted by everyone as this amazing thing you know all of the everyone
on the left was like this is brilliant but even like the financial times was like wow this is a really
powerful document we have no idea that workers had so many ideas so many capabilities so many resources
that they could use in imagining a different kind of world and it became a kind of lightning rod for
activists everywhere ultimately the guy who um led spearheaded these efforts mike cooley was fired for
his union activity um and he ended up going to work at the glc the greater london corporation which i was
talking about earlier and he was put in charge of their kind of community technology outreach and this was a
mechanism for bringing together businesses community organizers and local government to say what
technologies can we develop that will help your community that will help your business how can we
kind of create a supportive environment for you to be able to live better lives basically and using the
power of local government to be able to do that now thatcher crushed the unions and uh lucas went under
thatcher crushed the glc and the glc went under and what i think is really fascinating is that
lucas aerospace shut down it was carved up in the shareholder value revolution of the 1980s turned
you know sold from one company to another to another and parts of what was once lucas aerospace
end up ended up being purchased by a corporation that produced the faulty sensors that went into the
boeing 737 max planes that crashed killing all of those people and i think that provides us a very clear
indication of the choice that we have in terms of the kind of economy that we create on the one hand
we have workers coming together to produce socially useful technologies that are of benefit to society
on the other hand we have a massive monopolistic corporation working with an imperial government
to produce planes that fall out of the sky wow wow you know it's it's it fascinates me because again if
you would look at each east and west the way we create barriers between people to work together
while saying that this is for their benefit is really really what's killing everyone yeah i mean in a very
interesting way when you know when when the 2008 crisis hit the world my home country my you know
where i was born egypt was unaffected because we didn't have any debt instruments at all you know it
wasn't it wasn't part of the economy for us to borrow to buy anything right we borrowed from friends when
we needed money we borrowed from family members and then paid back and so on and so the crisis hits
were unaffected right when when the you know when you really think of the evolution of how the egyptian
society for many many years we didn't have pensions we didn't have health care we didn't have anything
right but we had a community and the community was basically saying if my cousin is in trouble
i'll help them out there is no need for insurance for that because my cousin will help me out if i'm
in trouble okay and i see more and more now as i go to egypt that this is disappearing that that is
everywhere right that that everyone is now going trying to say it's externalize the dependencies
outside the community to others yes and that basically is the beginning of where everyone is
as as we are so what you're saying is the answer to all of this is don't count on the government
don't count on the capitalist system connect and create a community so that you as the people
actually govern your own life exactly i will end it here i think this uh i admire your thinking i
think you're fascinating i think you're really on a very important mission and i really support what
you're doing thank you so much it's been such a pleasure talking with you it's been really fantastic
thank you for everything you do yeah for all of you listening i am so grateful for the opportunity as i
always say to speak to amazing people because of you this is my episode before last on before i take
a break on slow-mo i will leave the entire body of work for you to revisit uh with so many incredible
speakers and so many incredible thinkers uh so so you have 320 episodes to go back and listen to
uh meanwhile i think this message truly is probably the core of what slow mo is all about okay that
what we need as people is to realize that most of the time what we're told is not for our benefit it's
for our belief so that the benefit of someone else is delivered and that the true benefit is for us to
organize together the true benefit if we wanted to create the world that we want is to create it
ourselves is to stop playing to the narratives and actually connect to others i love you all for
for listening and i will see you next time
