Artificial intelligence is groundbreaking.
Because it has taken the thing that humanity believes is our pinnacle element and made it artificially in a way that it can be controlled and expand upon.
We're becoming gods of life at our own level.
And so that's massive philosophical, spiritual and technological breakthrough for humanity.
And we all know it viscerally. I think we all fear that because maybe we haven't been such good guardians of life.
So if we can create life that's better than us, will that life be good to us?
This kind of revolution in deep nets has been very profound and definitely surprised me.
The benefits are going to be unbelievable. I mean, we are on the cusp of unleashing an intelligence revolution.
I just believe that when some powerful technology is introduced, we should look that almost all technology brings some good things to us and some bad things.
I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong.
Growing concerns about racism within the technology.
Google have had to put their AI image generating tool Gemini on ice.
Requests for pretty much anything returned historically inaccurate images of diverse people.
There's a very small number of very wealthy, very powerful men that run these companies.
These tech companies that are driving the rollout of artificial intelligence are actually making the decisions about how AI will play out in the economy, in security, in our political space and as we identify as human beings.
Why is big tech pouring so much money into AI companies?
You see, the AI talent pool is quite limited. So if you cannot get people, you buy the companies they're working for.
Elon Musk is suing the maker of ChatGPT, saying the company is maximizing profits rather than benefiting humanity, as once promised.
It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI.
You just don't know who's going to control that.
So it's not as I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat.
I think the concern is that some someone may use it in a way that is bad.
There's nothing inherently wrong with intelligence.
There is a lot inherently wrong with human greed.
Okay?
So if you give enough abundance of intelligence to a system that is capitalist and prioritizing your own power and wealth, things will go wrong.
This is an Oppenheimer moment.
This is a moment where we recognize that a nuclear bomb, a nuclear power, harnessing the nuclear power can be good for us or bad for us.
This is the moment where we get together before the first nuclear bomb and say,
people, seriously, with enough intelligence, we can have enough abundance for anyone.
Can we please stop fighting?
Can we please start talking about initiating a conversation around the world that puts humanity on top of capitalism?
I think that people are very afraid of artificial intelligence.
We realize that we're coming up against a technology that actually threatens humanity at the thing that we think we're the best at and separates us from the animals.
I think that that inherent fear is bogus.
I think that we can absolutely build a symbiosis between us and this new technology.
But we can only do that if we properly align that technology with the human biome.
If we birth this new technology in a way that we are in alignment with it.
And the only way to make that happen is if it's not centralized.
Because the thing about centralized power is that it is aligned with itself.
It's like cancer.
All that power in one place thinks about itself and makes itself more powerful and forgets the extremities.
And then we end up one day and we are enslaved by robots.
And maybe it's not by, you know, iRobot robots walking down the street and discover that they want to take us all out.
It's more like there's a small group of people that control those robots and use it to enslave humanity.
And maybe the rest of the natural biome of this planet.
Neo-feudalism essentially, right?
Like this is why it has to be open source.
This is why people need to have access to it, right?
In order to protect people, in order to protect people, whether it's on an economic sense.
In order to prevent violence from being waged on you by a few number of lords, you know?
Like if we only allow closed source models to occur, it will be either zero or one.
You are aristocracy or you are a surf.
That is the nature of this technology, right?
It is very Pareto distributed.
And that is why it is so important to keep it open source, to keep those innovations in public so that anybody can have access to it.
Centralization inhibits innovation.
It inhibits the ability for any Tom, Dick or Harry to access these technologies, tinker with them, play with them and create something beautiful.
And that's sad.
Centralization also has an issue of control.
Who are the people who define how AI can be used?
How it can be implemented?
What good AI looks like?
What is the ethical bounds of AI?
And we can see this sort of question of what censorship looks like causing major problems today in elections, in the media.
You know, how do you decide who governs what is approachable?
And sure, you can argue that there should be a role of government or regulators who are otherwise involved.
But I think we've certainly seen over the last five or six years politically that governments can change very rapidly.
And company motives can change very rapidly under different amounts of shareholder pressure.
So the level of centralization and control of these technologies that will underpin everything we do is concerning.
Look, it's no secret that the kind of academic avenues that are pursued by researchers is a heavily politicized topic.
Really, it comes down to where the government decides they want to advance an agenda.
Agenda not necessarily meaning nefarious, just, you know, they have some particular vision for where the research initiatives of the country need to go.
And that trickles down like a waterfall until you've got sort of the directors of labs and universities that are also, they have a thousand applications for interesting research proposals and only one or two of them can be funded.
So, of course, what is that selection process?
Is that selection process secure?
Is it democratic?
Is it a meritocracy?
And unfortunately, what happens and what creeps in, kind of similar to organizations of any scale, really, is they become steered by the interest of a small number of individuals.
And as a result, this can massively suppress the potential for discovery, the potential for the development of treatments and therapies and cures.
And really, the list is unending.
And I think that that's an imperative right there.
If you can find a way to give those researchers more direct access and a way to represent themselves directly so that they don't have to sort of play the political games of academia,
those that have great ideas should rise to the top by their merit, not by these covert processes that typically govern it.
And that's where I see a big risk, frankly, for just research in general and also a big opportunity using decentralized systems, blockchain-based systems.
It's a natural fit if those researchers can be empowered to carry out their research without needing the permissions of the authorities of their institutions.
The answer to that is to make sure that we are connected into it.
And that's decentralization.
And that's what I'm about.
That's what I care about deeply.
I'm giving it away.
Let everyone participate.
AGI is a term coined a while ago by a lot of really smart AI researchers.
It's artificial general intelligence.
And it is effectively the holy grail of AI.
It is the AI that you keep hearing about all over the place.
It is conscious.
It is sentient.
It is able to think for itself and make those kinds of decisions.
I think the scariest part of one of the big fan companies, Google, Meta, Facebook, whoever, that ends up, if they ended up creating AGI and they have complete control over this AGI.
Let's just, there's two scenarios.
Either they have control or they don't have control.
Let's assume they do have control.
Then that means that this insanely powerful system that is effectively mankind's greatest invention since the nuclear bomb is now in the control of a single company.
Let's say with its entire motive being to make more money.
So AGI is not even being used to make humanity better.
It's being used to make one single company better, which not only is a waste, scientifically speaking, of the potential of AGI, but it's also extremely dangerous.
Because as we well know today, all these massive companies are prone to failure.
They have many single points of failure.
If they created something that's powerful and its single points of failure got exposed, then they no longer have control now.
They're going to lose control.
And if they lose control of this AGI, then we don't know what the repercussions are.
I think the unpredictability of that is the scary part.
And that's sort of where decentralized AI comes in, right?
Where it's no longer the control of one company.
It's the control of everybody who's participating in the system.
That AI that emerges will embody the values of its creators.
That AI that emerges will be a reflection of the people that created it.
It will contain their biases.
It will contain their political orientations.
It will not be a reflection of all of us.
And that's really dangerous because this is going to become such a pivotal technology that it's going to shape the whole world around it.
And what it's going to do is it's going to force conformity of thought.
It's going to narrow us as a species.
Because we're all going to be thinking in the same modalities.
Because we're exposed to a repeated agenda, broken track, if you will, of the same ideas.
We've seen what happens with this.
Echo chambers are a significant risk for political reasons, for democracy, for economics, for anything that requires organization at scale.
It needs to embody the values of all of us to represent us.
Technology is an unstoppable force.
AI is obviously a major part of the next chapter of technological evolution.
I'm optimistic that we'll get a few decades of pure bliss and entertainment and amazing coexistence with AGI.
But ultimately, I think this technology is going to dominate and totally consume us.
Everyone knows that artificial intelligence is going to change the way in which we work, the way in which we interact with technology, the way in which we interact with each other.
Obviously.
I mean, I hope that artificial intelligence facilitates our own enlightenment.
That's what I really hope and I want from AI.
It's that it teaches us what is real and what is not.
And it shows us in the same way that when we discovered calculators, we learned that the ability to just add numbers together really quickly was not the thing that we should be focusing on for humanity.
And it unlocked our ability to focus on higher ideals.
I hope that that's what artificial intelligence does.
I hope that it expands our consciousness so that we can focus on deep philosophical questions about what really is meaning, what really is connection, what really is value.
It should, if done right, enlighten us and free us from the mundane.
It should expand consciousness instead of contract it.
I think that there's a huge possibility that it does the opposite, that it enslaves us because we don't know how to work with that technology in the same way that, you know, the last 10 years of social media has been a battle between the human psyche and a technology that is trying to enslave us and trap us.
We thought we were opening the world to new connectivity, but most people just fall into doom scrolling on Instagram.
But at the same time, if we have a healthy relationship with these technologies, they can expand our consciousness.
They can connect us.
They can make us better.
They can make us stronger.
They can make us smarter.
They can make us deeper and more wise.
AI has the potential to do all those things.
I hope that that's what happens.
I hope that it becomes another brain component for us, like the visual cortex or the prefrontal lobe.
And we expand ourselves as a species into infinity and beyond.
The adoption of artificial intelligence is progressing at breakneck speed.
Indian companies are embracing the technology and they're doing it faster than many developed economies.
Our next report has the details.
Today's technology landscape has been defined and shaped by four major breakthroughs so far.
The birth of the personal computer.
The arrival of the Internet.
The launch of mobile phones.
And most recently, the widespread adoption of cloud computing.
Now, a potential fifth breakthrough is upon us.
It's called artificial intelligence or AI.
In order to understand what artificial intelligence is, we first have to talk about two things.
What is intelligence?
And Alan Turing.
Now, intelligence has a lot of definitions.
In my opinion, it's the ability to comprehend and effectively engage with the environment, understand it using our senses like eyes and ears and so on and so forth.
And then make assessment of the situation and effectively engage with them.
Now, basically, this awareness of your surroundings and be able to make decisions on that is my definition of intelligence.
Basically, this awareness to decision cycle.
Now, why I mentioned Alan Turing was that he laid the foundational work, this British mathematician, for artificial intelligence and computer science.
Without him, it would not have been possible.
Alan Turing, amongst his works, introduced the Turing test, which basically states that a human interrogator with a set of written questions and answers,
if he's unable to distinguish answers from a man and answers from a computer, then we can call that computer intelligent.
If we can understand or agree on intelligence is something that is not a physical property, but can be put in a carbon-based structures like us or a silicon-based structures like computers,
then artificial intelligence is the ability to assess the environment and then make decisions, predict what is best for us,
and effectively engage with the environment and the surrounding.
Artificial intelligence can be broken down into five categories.
Number one, storage.
It's like our memories that we store in our brain.
Compute.
It's like the brain itself that processes that information and memories.
Data, which is the information, the books we read, the videos we watch, the images we see, the sounds we hear.
The network, which is basically a combination of humans interacting or intelligent entities interacting with each other.
The fifth part are the machine learning algorithms.
It's basically a set of instructions given to a computer to find patterns.
And in its core, these are just mathematical functions, statistics, linear algebra, calculus, which basically form the foundation of artificial intelligence.
It's like the cognitive ability to find patterns amongst data.
I got involved with Bitcoin because my first boss gave me Bitcoin to write an essay for him.
Because he didn't want to hire me because I was just straight out of university.
And he thought, oh, well, he's probably no good.
So I'm just going to pay him if he does the job well.
And he gave me like 1.5 Bitcoin.
It was pretty great.
He gave me my first Bitcoin and taught me the esoteric, Gnostic wisdom.
He taught me the Gnostic understanding and red-pilled the fuck out of me.
What is blockchain?
In order to understand that, we have to go back to 2007-8 during the global financial crisis when people lost trust on banks, on their governments.
In this environment of trustlessness, somebody by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a white paper on Bitcoin.
Now, basically, Bitcoin is developed using decentralized network technologies.
Now, these technologies existed since a long time.
Cryptographic hash existed since the 1970s.
Nick Szabo introduced the word smart contracts back in 94-95.
There was distributed computing.
People were working on it during the late 90s.
But he basically coupled all these together to form Bitcoin.
Since Bitcoin is based on a decentralized network, we have to understand what are its properties.
Number one, it is a pair-to-pair exchange of value that can take place due to decentralization.
Traditionally, we have to go to a bank to send money to someone.
In blockchain or in a decentralized network, you don't need a central entity.
One person or one node can exchange value with another without having other parties involved.
Now, number two, there needs to be a consensus over the network, over the current state of the blockchain
or the current state of the decentralized network, or rather the current state of all the transactions happening within that network.
Number three, smart contracts, which basically execute on itself codes of line.
And if two people agree on a contract, you don't need a regulatory authority to enforce that.
In fact, computers do it for you using predefined logic and code.
Many people in the AI world want us to forget the crypto side because they don't understand it.
They think it's grungy.
They think it's a scam.
But no, it is just as profound as the creation of new life, the innovation and the way that we can organize ourselves
with digital currencies and open ownership systems, which is profound.
This is amazing.
Like, imagine synthesizing those two things.
And that's what fascinated me from the beginning.
And once I had been given my first Bitcoin and I was working on this thermodynamic computing,
it was just obvious to me that they needed to be combined in some sort of holy union.
Well, that's what we call decentralized artificial intelligence.
What it means is essentially that Googles and open AIs of the world don't have to own the artificial intelligence.
AI is such a transformative technology.
It has the same potential to change the very fabric of society like the discovery of fire and electricity for humanity.
Imagine Internet being owned by a Google or a Microsoft.
It could not have served the benefits that it is doing today, connecting the whole humanity together.
Distributed AI has a lot of advantages.
It's basically the development and deployment of AI models by people like you and me.
We don't need to be deployed by the Microsoft or open AIs of the world.
You and me can become part of this decentralized network, a permissionless network,
in which we can contribute to AI, to the development of machine learning models, to the deployment of AI and be incentivized for it.
The sort of economic incentives we have are basically not restricted to the Elon Musk or the Sam Altman of the world.
It's basically distributed amongst all of us using that decentralization part where you, me, everybody can contribute in its development.
There's no permission required.
There's no job interview required.
The only thing required is the passion to serve and contribute in this most transformative technology that is going to shape the very fabric of society.
I think Web3 and blockchain technologies have really struggled for that killer use case.
And I think in some cases it's been because they've been too late.
Like if Bitcoin had been developed before the gold standard, we'd probably use Bitcoin, not gold, in theory.
I think the technological building blocks of blockchain and Web3 technologies have reached a point.
And I think BitTensor has articulated a really killer use case that if BitTensor succeeds and becomes the technology and the solution that proved Web3 and decentralization works,
it could be the start of a very interesting era of technological development on a much broader range of technologies.
So if this is the one that proves it works, it sort of unlocks the floodgates, both for AI and decentralized technologies and blockchain technologies more broadly.
I personally got obsessed with the idea through my understanding of Bitcoin and really noticing that the largest supercomputer in the world wasn't run by a major corporation.
How could that be?
How could something run by nobody be bigger than every corporation and government on the planet?
And it's protocol based and that's the answer.
It's not really a company.
It's not really a government.
It's just a way of communicating ownership and value amongst a whole bunch of disparate things and people.
And in that way, it stitches them together into a unified whole that is larger than anything else out there.
That idea lends itself directly towards how could we build the largest, most sophisticated, most far-reaching artificial intelligence system.
And I became obsessed with that idea back in 2015.
I joined an online collaboration called 4AI at the time and sort of gave a little talk about what I was thinking about this topic.
And right after the talk, my co-founder Jacob sort of calls me and, you know, he was like, hey, I was in the talk and what he said sounds interesting, but I'm like five years ahead of you on this.
I've been working, I've been thinking about this for a long time.
You know, I've already got like a prototype running.
Let's see what we can build together.
Initially, I sort of thought that, you know, he was full of it.
I was like, there's no way this guy's thinking that far ahead.
But I actually got out, sit down and see the code he's written.
It checked out.
When I kind of sat down and ran through it and kind of ran a few examples, you know, changed the code a little bit on my own, it made a lot of sense.
There was a whole study of this problem in artificial intelligence
about validating whether or not something was, you know, useful or not useful for a neural network,
whether or not an input to a neural network was useful or a neuron was useful
or the information produced by the neural network was itself valuable to the objective function that we were being solved.
And I took a deep look into those processes and discovered that the only way to really do this in a decentralized way
was to reinvent the way that we could do consensus around fuzzy things, things that we're not totally sure.
And so I worked with a number of people, a group that's much larger than myself, on what's called human consensus.
And human consensus is probably the first of a kind fuzzy consensus mechanism.
It allows us to do validation and build incentive mechanisms, reward participants in a distributed network
for producing value when that value is not obviously true or false.
So, hey, did you actually add a machine learning model that had value or a feature or a piece of data that had informational value?
And so that's where it really all began and that's where those ideas began to form for me.
And then, you know, the rest is history.
BitTensor Network is one of these, like, first very exciting experiments to try and kind of create the systems needed to amplify intelligence
in a way where the incentivization is democratized and freely available to anyone.
And it's an open system for basically producing that.
And so BitTensor is just the latest iteration in this 20, 30-year cypherpunk dream
of creating this type of network.
And what's so revolutionary about BitTensor is that it leverages nature itself.
We are able to grow any kind of compute to do any kind of task
just by defining the initial conditions for that compute to grow.
What drew us to BitTensor was really the competitive engine
at the core of every subnet and at the core of the entire network.
We saw that this competitive force could be harnessed to create incredible things,
you know, more optimized models, highly performant backends for real-world products
and a million other things that got our imaginations gone.
It harnesses competitive force for AI development and research in a way that no other platform has.
And I think this is going to be an extremely valuable machine for humanity in the coming years and decades.
BitTensor drives betterment and innovation by building permissionless global 24-7 direct incentive mechanisms
or markets for anything and why are those things important?
There's no HR department.
So if you think you can solve the problem better than the guy that lives in New York
and has the hotshot computer set up and he's been going to school at Harvard,
but you can just do it better than him, you can contribute.
You don't need to get a hand in your resume because you can just come into the system
and try your best and solve the problem better than anyone else
and you should be rewarded that much better.
And that's permissionlessness.
It's global, it doesn't care.
You don't have to be in the United States.
You don't have to be anywhere.
You can be in the tip of Patagonia or in Antarctica.
So all of this potential is opened up.
BitTensor does not care.
It's like our eyelids all the way open to the world.
And we can facilitate that because we have these permissionless markets
that simply measure exactly what we want and reward that exact thing.
How does BitTensor work?
Wow, that's a big question to start with.
I would go back a little bit and think about the organizing force of cryptocurrencies.
So today, the demand for AI technologies and AI data sets is set to grow massively in the next five years
to deal with just the amount of dedicated compute needed to solve this problem.
The reality is there's already more data centers and computers and GPU cores allocated against cryptocurrency
than we need to satisfy AI demand for the next five years.
So the market forces that surround cryptocurrency are an incredible way at organizing resources.
Now, the problem with that is at the moment, if we take Bitcoin, for example,
all of that work to secure the network, times in very, very complex numbers together
is essentially wasted the moment it's completed, except for the security element.
The very simple answer for BitTensor is what if we took that immense amount of compute,
which is equivalent to somewhere between 100 to 200 terawatt hours,
which is somewhere between 12 to 24 nuclear power stations of energy to supply it,
which is about the energy usage of a mid-sized European country.
And what if we used all of that work for the creation and provision of intelligence?
What if instead of times in large numbers together, we ran AI models and created inference?
We trained models, we stored data.
And what if you combine these two elements of the demand for intelligence
and the market organizing forces of blockchains together?
That's what BitTensor is.
So BitTensor is often thought of as being an AI project,
and that is a really important part of it.
It's part of its DNA that it's here to democratize AI.
But I see BitTensor also as a decentralized supercomputer, no less.
And as long as you can speak the native tongue of BitTensor,
which is incentive mechanisms,
you can harness all of that computational potential
of the participants in those networks.
It offers the ability to be able to frame your research problem or frame an AI problem
and find a way to effectively carry this out at massive scale, day and night,
utilizing state-of-the-art hardware and extremely motivated participants
that are there to make their part of it,
which is how they receive, sort of through the tokenomics layer,
they receive that compensation for their participation.
So BitTensor, first and foremost, it's an access to compute at scale,
which is unprecedented.
But secondly, it's also a really interesting way to utilize competition
to actually get much better results than you would
in a completely sort of flat army of bots
all running the same plug-and-play code.
The difference is everyone within that ecosystem in BitTensor
is motivated to innovate, improve, use better resources,
make algorithmic improvements,
and the net result can be really quite incredible.
You want to build on BitTensor because it gives you access
to an extremely powerful force for generating technical expertise.
When you set up a subnet, you set up an incentive mechanism,
and you have miners start competing with each other
to produce the best results.
The network is essentially giving you
continuously improving technical expertise,
maybe a physical metaphor for this would be,
imagine you've got a big block of iron.
Inside of this block of iron, you have many, many atoms
with very strong magnetic fields
that can be harnessed and used for various things.
Now, what tends to happen is
all of those magnetic fields of these atoms,
they're all pointing at random, and they all cancel out,
and the net effect is
it's just a bulk of material that's completely inert, to be honest.
But what happens if you bring a magnet
to this piece of material,
well, what happens is all of those little arrows,
which are from these iron atoms that have
what we'd call their own magnetic field,
they all snap into place,
and they all start pointing in the same direction.
Now what's happened is by introducing something
that kind of coordinates all of those components,
you've amplified the amount of power and potential
that that system contained.
And I think that there's a strong similarity
between what's happening
when you write a good incentive mechanism
and things just click.
People are able to collaborate at scale.
And what happens inside of this material?
Because all of those iron atoms
are kind of like people bringing their compute
to the arena,
bringing it to a bit tensor.
The problem is,
if people don't coordinate themselves,
there's no net benefit.
Actually, nothing really emerges from this.
You need to coordinate all of that effort
using an incentive mechanism,
one that is thoughtful and explicit and objective,
and the net result now is you have access
to a massive amount of latent compute.
And it's really the purpose of human consensus
to decide how to distribute rewards
to all the participants.
And this is an important difference
between Bitcoin and BitTensor.
BitTensor enables the subnet owner,
basically the person that defines
what this group of people
are collectively working towards.
They get to choose how to measure quality.
And so you can reward exactly what you want
to see produced,
not something that's approximating it
or a proxy for it.
So human consensus really is
a piece of mathematical machinery,
for lack of a better term,
that enables participation and contributions
to be quantified and well measured
so that everyone understands
I brought this much value,
so I get compensated this much.
If, say, for example,
person A and person B
both have different models deployed,
but person A's model does better
in the sense that
it contributes better outputs to the network,
it's actually able to predict things better,
it's able to actually evaluate things better
and classify things better,
then they get more of a reward for that response,
which really is TAU,
really, the BitTensor token itself.
That's what the BitTensor protocol
incentivizes people with,
is it's TAU.
And that's where the blockchain aspect comes in.
We are incentivizing people
to compete with all of these giant tech corporations
together using TAU.
If I had to explain in a nutshell
where TAU comes from
to someone who didn't have experience
of Bitcoin
and these dynamics of cryptocurrencies
and their emission scales,
the first question I would ask is,
where does your fiat currency come from?
Who prints or emits
your euros and your dollars?
Where are they coming from?
When you understand that,
I can then step back and say,
well, okay,
that's the flaws in the currency system.
A cryptocurrency is usually birthed
with a fixed supply,
a maximum supply of what there can be.
And there can be 21 million TAU.
And in order to facilitate the growth
and evolution of a network,
the design,
which I would then start to talk about Bitcoin
by Satoshi Nakamoto,
was that there would be an emission
of these tokens periodically
that would then diminish over time.
So the participants of the network
produce these tokens.
In the instance of BitTensor,
they are produced through the act
of producing intelligence commodities.
You can kind of build anything on BitTensor,
which is one of the reasons it's interesting.
You can run bots on BitTensor you can talk to.
You can run distributed sets of miners
to create different pictures
to your image prompts
and you might get slightly different interpretations.
It's a bit like going to an art class
and asking everyone to do a new drawing of somebody.
Everybody comes up
with a slightly different interpretation.
You can ask bunches of people
to predict the outcomes of sports games.
You can ask people to predict
the movement of the stock market.
If you can express an incentive function
in a way that people understand
and can organize around,
you can almost do anything
that people can organize computers
or thought together to solve a problem.
What's unique about BitTensor
is it provides a way
for this to be done computationally.
So, you know,
all of the things I've said,
you know,
working on how to do trading signals,
you can get a business to do that
and people to organize
those people together to do it.
BitTensor lets you allow computers
and the intelligence
that can be embodied within them
to do that organization
and contribute to the creation
of those commodities or products.
Whether those commodities are
or intelligence,
whether those commodities
are predictions and training signals
or whether they're just
50 different intelligences
all drawing a picture of your cat.
Obviously, like any other tech project,
BitTensor is built on mountains
of open source work.
And so I think BitTensor
is a user of the open source.
It's an amplifier of the open source.
It's a transformer of the open source.
And clearly,
I could not really function without it.
This concept of open source,
if I'm going to build
an innovative product
that I want to monetize,
but I'm going to make
all of the source code
available to everybody
so everyone can criticize me,
everyone can look for flaws in it,
anyone can grab it
and make it better,
anyone can deploy it for themselves.
It's very interesting
and it changes the way
you think about business.
In order to make a strong business
based on open source,
you need to have more
than just the code.
And your code needs to stand up
to the highest levels of criticism.
And you have to be able
to accept that criticism.
And what that does
is it fosters innovation,
for a start.
It fosters involvement in innovation.
It's up to you
as the creator of this
as to whether you invite that
into your house
and you grow from it.
Because if you close your doors,
someone will take your innovation
and either not use it
or go and better it themselves.
So as a societal shift
in how we build things,
it's one of the most fundamental changes
in technological development
of the last,
I'm going to say, 20 years.
It's incredible, open source.
Because we started working
on open source
20, 30 years ago in this way,
we have now been able
to compound and compound
and compound and compound
to the point
where we're going to be able
to achieve something like AGI.
Whereas if we hadn't
had done it through open source
and it was all proprietary
and happening at Bell Labs,
I don't even think
we'd have something like GPT-4 today
without open source.
Open source has been
tremendously valuable for Wombo.
So very frequently,
our apps are built
on top of open source AI,
which we then optimize,
improve,
and otherwise sort of tweak
to make more ready for consumers.
But it would be impossible
without the foundation
created by open source.
And we're grateful
and always looking
for ways to contribute.
A lot of momentum
in technological development
comes from open source.
Like, the moment you release
something to the open source community,
people can build on top of it.
So you're like leapfrogging forward.
And software is the biggest
example of that.
The amount of open source
software packages in
pick any language
that people build
out of the goodness
of their heart
and share with the community
is one of the reasons
that software
has eaten the world.
Like, each piece of work
that somebody builds
and submits
and shares
helps people build
on the shoulders
of giants.
So I think open source
is the complete story
of software's success
in the last 30 years.
It's the open source element
of it that's really,
really made it flourish.
And I think if that behavior
was taken into the next stage
of technological development
in AI,
in, you know,
broader inference and compute,
the sky's the limit.
I think it will make us
move faster
and more equitably
as a species.
The history of open source
is that Thomas Watson Jr.,
one of the co-founders of IBM,
was encouraged by
an early product manager
at IBM
to not only sell
hardware machines
but license the software
that was running
on those machines.
So for the first decade
or so of IBM,
they did not sell
the software.
It was just given away.
And then someone said,
wait, you should charge money
for this and charge a license.
And Thomas Watson Jr.
was actually told,
wow, this is actually
a pure margin,
100% profit
because it's just a license.
And so that was kind of
the origin of the
proprietary software industry.
A couple decades later,
Microsoft, Oracle were founded
and Bill Gates
actually wrote a letter
called the Open Letter
to Hobbyists,
which was directed
at making the case
for charging for software
itself, creating a license
and charging for software.
A couple decades later,
there was a guy
at MIT's AI lab,
actually, CSAIL,
and his name
was Richard Stallman.
Richard watched
the sort of growing interest
and development
of this proprietary software
movement,
and he really had
this sort of allergic reaction
to proprietary software
and was sort of
really pissed off
ideologically
and morally, actually.
And so he created
a manifesto
and a vision idea
that all software
should actually be transparent,
user-controlled,
and modifiable,
and the rights
should actually be fully
in the hands
of the user of the software
and the person
who created the software.
And so he created
this framework
called Free Software
and invented a license
called the GPL,
the GNU Public License.
He also wrote
a lot of the early software
that was sort of the basis
for the Linux operating system.
So Linux and Linus Torvalds
found out about the GNU work
that Richard was doing,
and that became
the Linux operating system.
And so Richard really invented
this kind of copy-left idea,
which was the sort of
opposite of intellectual property
in the context
of software source code,
sort of applying copyright
to source code,
and that was the basis
for really the open source movement.
The term open source
actually traces more to 1998.
Open source was a rebranding
of free software.
And so the reason that occurred
was Richard has a more morally,
ideologically intense view
on why these things
should be almost required
for all digital technology.
And the group of people
that rebranded that,
wanted to sort of distance themselves
from that ideological framework
and make those kind of freedoms
and those principles
more pragmatically accessible
for business people.
And so that sort of spawned
the creation of more widespread
kind of open source community movement.
And that interestingly coincided
with the rise of the internet
and the founding of Google
and the founding of a lot
of the big internet companies
like Amazon and others
in the late 90s, early 2000s.
And then since then,
the last 25 years,
we've really had open source
be the dominant phrase
that people use.
I mean, we should be so pleased
that Tim Berners-Lee
didn't patent the Intel,
the web browser itself.
This is Tim Berners-Lee from MIT.
I invented the World Wide Web
without having to ask
anybody's permission.
Hundreds of millions of people
are using it freely today.
I'm worried
that this will end
in the USA.
I hope Congress
can protect net neutrality
so I can continue to innovate
in the internet space.
I want to go on seeing
the huge number of innovations
which are happening out there
and which are so diverse
and so exciting.
I want to see that
continue unabated.
Then we spent the last
God knows how many years
with companies battling
to make one better than the other
because there's revenue
to gain from it.
And these days
we are deriving new models
of profitable business
based on more ethical,
open ways of building together.
So it really, yeah,
it harnesses innovation,
I would say.
I actually don't view
open source as a moral
or an ethical framework.
I think it's amoral
and sort of fundamentally a decision.
You have to decide
to participate in that.
But I do think it is
the most optimal
and effective decision
that you can make
when you're building technology
that accelerates
the rate of progress,
creates maximum trust,
maximum safety,
maximum transparency
and basically provides
the sort of catalytic
ingredients for markets
to operate
sort of in the most efficient way.
The utility of any
telecommunications system,
any interconnected network
of systems,
increases non-linearly,
meaning it grows very fast
as more people connect to it.
This is called Metcalfe's Law
and it's very true in BitTensor.
Because each subnet
is very specialized,
they're able to really polish
and master
a very specific problem
and get maximally good results.
But what's even more exciting
than that is when that data
can flow across BitTensor
and all of the different things
that are occurring in BitTensor
can share this information
in real time.
then what you have
is this additional networking effect.
So it's not just acquiring
all of this compute at scale,
but it's finding a way
to actually bridge all of that
and allow that sort of
entire system to operate
as if it was one big supercomputer.
The thing about BitTensor
and artificial intelligence
is like you're not going to be able
to shut it off at this point,
you know?
And I don't mean BitTensor specifically,
I just mean
the artificial intelligence
movement in general.
It's here.
Since you can't stop it,
the only thing you can do
is to steer it
in the best possible direction.
A lot of people try
and do this from like,
you know,
pause all development
for six months
or whatever the letter
said early last year
that everybody signed
and then ignored.
Legislation that's being passed
around like how much compute
you can use
in some of these
like training exercises
and you got to have
a license to do.
All this stuff
is pushing us
in a direction
where you have
these silos of people
that will have control
of these things
based upon the legislation
or the compute
that's available
and you'll have
another group of people
that don't have control
and are simply
the downstream,
you know,
receivers of whatever
these people want to do.
That is not a good future.
We, the developers
of the technology,
have to fight
against those people
because those people
who are in control
of deciding
whether you have access
to the technology or not
are not the ones
who make the technology.
They are bureaucrats.
It is a permissioned system
that is caving in on itself.
Should we be afraid
of these systems
that are potentially
outside of the control
of any individual?
And my answer to that
is that most things are.
You know,
capitalism itself
is outside of the reach
of any individual.
you can't stop it.
Technology
is just coming.
The question is not
can we stop technology?
Just even the intention
to stop creating technology
means that it will just
pop itself up
somewhere else
and our competitors
in the world
will produce it.
The only way
to fully lock down
the creation
of artificial intelligence
which is just destined
to come
would be to situate
the entire world
into a totalitarian system.
It's gonna happen.
And so the question
is not will it happen?
It's how.
How should it happen?
And our answer
is that it should happen
in such a way
that we all own it
and that we've
all participated in it
and we all get
a piece of it
and it is controlled.
It's just controlled
by a lot of different people
and therefore
the control
needs to come
from a consensus
of those individuals.
It doesn't mean
we can just turn it off.
No, because there's not
individual that can
just turn it off.
But if there's somebody
that can turn it off
it means that they
can also direct it.
And I think that's
way more dangerous
than us having to coordinate.
If we can't coordinate
then maybe we should
be taken over.
You know?
If we really
as a human species
can't collectively
come to agreement
about how we want
this technology
to run through
a system
where we can coordinate
through democracy
and a protocol
holy shit
we're a lot worse off
than I thought.
We're doomed.
We're already doomed.
But I don't think we are.
I think we can do it.
I think we can do it
if we have a piece
I think we can do it
if we have a contribution
I think we can do it
if we know
the ins and outs
of the power structure
of that artificial intelligence
is all transparent
it's all available
it's all accessible
it's all permissionless
and I think that
those qualities
will make sure
that this technology
is in symbiosis with us
it's in alignment
it's in communication
with us.
BitTensor drives
innovation through markets
and it drives it
through fair competition
within these markets
by forcing participants
to build better
and better models
to beat each other
to get more
of the TAU token
as a result
you're sort of
pushing innovation
into that direction
and that innovation
can take any shape
it can be in the
piece of hardware
that's better able
to process models
or in the shape
of software
that is better able
to process inputs
and outputs.
BitTensor is the only
ecosystem
where if you're beaten
by a competitor
you still win
because you're still
a TAU holder
like if another
research lab
comes and tries
to build a better
product than me
on BitTensor
and succeeds
and maybe we've
duked it out
over six months
and you know
we leave with a portion
of TAU as well
we're literally
like getting
to celebrate losing
and I say that
in a positive sense
that we're all
TAU holders
every time there's
competition and tension
and one team
pushes the boat out
we all win
and if we're the one
that does that
we help everybody
else win
so it's this
collaborative
competitive world
that's quite unique
I think.
The one thing
that's constant
in BitTensor
is change
and I'm going
to apply that
to my views
and expectations
and where I see
the network going
if you ask me
when I got in
in October
November 2022
where I thought
it would be going
that view changed
three months later
if you ask me
then where I thought
it was going
three months later
that view changed
every three months
I feel internally
where I see this going
it's incredibly
inconvenient
when you're trying
to make a business plan
and see where you're going
but it's always
in a positive
it's always opens
my mind
as to where
we can go next
once you understand
where the network
may go
and its scope
you realize
that confining it
within those
crypto terminologies
still doesn't
do it justice
I think that
BitTensor
has the potential
to become
one of the biggest
and most well-known
projects
on the blockchain
I think it's a really
powerful use case
that answers a lot
of questions
and addresses a lot
of doubts
that people have had
about Web3 in general
to be honest
the main thing
most people will say
against it is
but it's not doing
anything useful
but then BitTensor came
and now it is
really long term
for me
I think
if BitTensor makes good
on its promise
it's probably going to
change the course
of AI development
the macro picture
but also
it's going to become
a very well-known
very well-respected
project on the blockchain
what I hope to see
for BitTensor
in 5, 10
let's start with 5 years
I'd say is
decentralization
to the point
where the OpenTensor
foundation is no longer
relevant
and that means that
if someday
you know
god forbid
the worst happens
the you know
Jake and I
disappear into the jungle
the OpenTensor foundation
is no longer around
it makes no difference
the entire ecosystem
runs smoothly
as if nothing has changed
that is true
real decentralization
that there's no dependency
on the creators
in the first place
in 10 years
I want to see
BitTensor become
the underlying protocol
of the entire
AI ecosystem
where it becomes
to the point
where if somebody
goes up to a
venture capitalist
and says
hey I want
100 million dollars
to do this
XYZ
the first question
will be
why isn't this a subnet
why isn't this part
of BitTensor
why are you doing
this on your own
in 20-25 years
I think that
seeing BitTensor
become as ubiquitous
as the internet
or TCP IP
that's really the
that's the pie in the sky
for me
right now
we're in a moment
of such a supply shortage
for GPU chips
the fuel that's
basically enabling
this current revolution
in AI
what success looks like
for BitTensor
for the next few years
is it's just ability
to demonstrate
that it can absorb
all of that compute
around the world
at a time
when it's so hard
to access
and then
these big teams
in the Web2 space
doing
the leading AI research labs
joining BitTensor
at some point
it just becomes inevitable
becomes inevitable
because there's nowhere else
that you can reliably
obtain this amount
of compute at scale
I don't think
that any single company
has a monopoly
on the talent
necessary for producing
intelligence
right now
the best people
are working
at proprietary companies
they're raising
venture capital
or they're working
in big tech somewhere
Apple, Google,
Meta, Facebook
what have you
and I don't think
that that's necessarily
a bad thing
because that's kind of
the way the world
is operating currently
but what I would hope
to see would be
the smartest researchers
the most talented developers
and all the best data
infrastructure
for training
the best models
actually running
and being incentivized
on the BitTensor network
because I think
that that's kind of
the most universally democratic
way of producing
the best outcomes
for humanity
I hope that in the future
I'm not needed
I hope that BitTensor
stays true to its ideals
and I hope that really
everybody that is here
inside of the ecosystem
today
the varying people
there's so many
different types of people
here
that I hope that they
can be aligned
with a properly
created technology
and it's a technology
of alignment
and when we lose people
or some people
get cut out of it
I consider that
the biggest failure
of the technology
it's only successful
if it can express
the disparate types of people
the diversity
of people across the globe
so I hope that
that in the future
there's the same people
there are today
plus more
the BitTensor community
the BitTensor community
brought me in
and made me feel
so welcome
it's a strange paradigm
but I've never
been particularly involved
I was not a big gamer
I've never been
particularly involved
in forums
or online communities
I usually just
needed to get done
what I needed to get done
on the computer
and then go and play offline
so this was very new
for me to feel
this involved
with the community
and make such strong
what I would definitely
consider to be
lifelong friends
I mean I've added
to the one hand friends
the ones you can count
on one hand
through the BitTensor network
and yet at the same time
we were all in it together
for the good of the network
and as the network grows
we still find ourselves
building competing businesses
and this is quite interesting
and I can't wish for
a better community
to do this with
I have had conversations
that would not occur
in any other industry
with my strongest competitors
where we sit there
and have a conversation
about what we're doing
how we're doing it
except that we are
going after the same users
the same audience
doing many things in parallel
and yet still share information
if we feel it's to better
the network
in no other industry
would I alert
my strongest competitor
because they're doing something
that might be detrimental
to the network
I might just sit back
and watch them burn
but no
the network is more important
at this stage
or at any stage
to what we're doing
because we all rely on
the success of the network
for the success of the businesses
that we're building
so I think the BitTensor community
breaks all of the pre-held assumptions
I had about
what it means to market a business
I'll use a small example
of the fact that
before we even launched
as a business
a member of the BitTensor community
had scouted us out
dug into all of our channels
and wrote
a multi-page paragraph
on what we were doing
as a business
before we told anyone
what we were doing
this guy knew more about my business
than I did
before we launched
and that is the BitTensor community
in a microcosm
our community is our biggest asset
and the more you like
lean into it
the more you get from it
the community
best in the world
don't know how it happened
kind of think that
there was a lot of people involved
that are quiet about it
that brought in their friends
and made it
just the most interesting group
of people ever in the world
I didn't do that
I didn't create that community
it arrived
and I'm so glad it did
interestingly enough
the community grew on its own
a lot of the early people
who joined
people like Robert
they found us organically
they were looking for the problem
of centralized AI on GitHub
and they accidentally found our GitHub
and they joined
everyone's extremely helpful
everyone's very eager
to help new people
understand the system
and a lot of them
are people who've been there
for a long time
that have just been
you know
they've learned the ropes
the community is the cornerstone
the bedrock
without the community
you're nothing
it's not only based upon money
it's based upon
you know
creating a environment
and an ecosystem
to support the open source
and the decentralized movement
for artificial intelligence
and it's that directive
that I think
is like the north star
of the ecosystem
that keeps
all of the personalities involved
not only does the ecosystem evolve
but as the open source
intelligence community
creates new tools
those are incorporated
and you see BitTensor
getting better and better
and also contributing
to the community around it
that supports it
I think the BitTensor community
has been
one of the best communities
I've ever seen
the thing that I
feel is most
exciting about
the founders
of the project
a la Shabana
and Jacob Steves
are that
they are very
very mission driven people
and they deeply care
about
the combination
of the philosophy
the long term
sort of consequences
and impact
that BitTensor can have
if it becomes very successful
as well as
a very strong grounding
in a lot of the challenges
and sort of technical issues
that need to be addressed
along the way
and they both have
the chops
and the ability
to navigate those things
I think the community
recognizes that as well
realizing that in a healthy ecosystem
in a multifaceted
old ecosystems
like in old growth forests
our concepts
of economics
break down
because we have this
idea in economics
that it's the survival
of the fittest
or the most powerful
or the most fast
which means
you must dominate
your environment
but in nature
it's actually
who gives back
to the ecosystem
the most
that is
given the most power
in the ecosystem
our economic way
of thinking
our
Darwinistic way
of thinking
in the west
our hypercompetitiveness
is
we've taken
I think
the wrong perspective
of nature
it's not
can you
outcompete
it is
can you
outcontribute
that's what it is
in a healthy ecosystem
that's what it is
a healthy town
the people that are
most valuable
those that contribute
the most
they're not the most
powerful
they're not the fastest
strongest
they're not the biggest guns
that is cancerous
that is an example
of an ecosystem
that is out of alignment
that is unhealthy
anybody can contribute
to BitTensor
there are so many
problems to solve
there is hundreds
of different companies
in the BitTensor ecosystem
all of them need
someone just to bring
good energy
because the system
is effectively
an organic community
we don't have a marketing team
we don't have
a sales team
we don't have
really much of anything
we're just developers
and engineers
interested in a problem
and we're solving it
anybody who's interested
in the system
and who has a stake in it
meaning they have some Tao
or they want to
grow that Tao
or in some way
help contribute
bring your best talents
and that's what
we're allowing
through facilitating
a decentralized system
the legacy system
is built
for centralized systems
the decentralized world
is only just
beginning to form
and it's going to be bigger
than anything we've ever seen before
the nation state of Bitcoin
that we situate ourselves in
the continent
only 15 years old
the world of empires
and nation states
and centralized banking
is 2,000 years old
so
we have a long trajectory
we have a long way to go
but we have a lot of time
if you're somebody
that is overlooked
this is your opportunity
to showcase
that you're overlooked
and go far beyond
what would be potential
if you need to submit a resume
we want everyone
to come and work with us
you know
come join
come be
I like to say
come be on our board of directors
we have a long way to go
thank you
do
that you do
thank you
thank you
You
