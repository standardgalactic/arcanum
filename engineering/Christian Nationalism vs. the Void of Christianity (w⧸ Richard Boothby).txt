in this episode what we have as christianity as one of the world's
religions in fact the most populous one the largest group i'm convinced more and more that
that that the the basic message of this wandering rabbi if we want to call him that jesus wandering
around nazareth he was betrayed by paul by taking paul taking away the real message which has to do
with how we allow ourselves and challenge ourselves to turn to the other with true openness with true
heart with true caring and see what what's happened together when uh instead paul uh effectively
takes the salvation theme and infinitizes it taking it as if we're being called by by the pauline
you know um notion of salvation in the next life that we're being removed from this one
uh i feel like that the the real message of jesus was something much more of course in some sense much
more humble uh but that's exactly where its great strength was um and we've we've allowed ourselves
to be kind of intoxicated with this this uh appeal to the the transcendent infinite when it's right
in front of us we don't have to go to another world we're right in the only world hey everyone
welcome to my conversation with the philosopher richard boothby um first of all let me just state
this is going to be a long introduction now of course you can skip this and head straight to the
the podcast but i do urge you to keep listening on especially uh if you're australian the reason
being um i had recorded a few other episodes before this uh with a few other guests i've got one
coming up with jack black the uh not the not the actor but in this case the uh psychoanalytic theorist
and uh sociologist and also uh the cognitive computing researcher marl barreson which they'll both be
coming out soon uh and generally i do release podcasts as per the order of the recording date
however this one with professor boothby in particular um i kind of put on each release a bit earlier uh
given we have an federal election coming up here in australia and i wanted to get it out nice and early
so that it'll be picked up by the algorithms because i felt like uh if i could put it a bit auditiously
it was a bit of an ethical duty uh for me to put out this conversation prior to the federal election
and where people are trying to make up their minds about uh who to vote for and whatnot now i'm not
going to beat around the bush there's no denying the fact that there's been a shift to right-wing
politics and sometimes even far-right politics uh globally um and a lot of that for sure has to do with
pure simple material economic structural conditions the cost of living crisis is becoming unbearable the
inequality is um downright obscene um and all of these nations especially those like here in australia
or the us or canada or parts of europe that for once places of hope places of dreams where people
went for a better life uh i don't know i don't know if that's the case anymore in these countries uh
again not due to any any inherent essential problem with these countries at all but rather due to economic
material conditions as i did mention and amidst this of course people are really feeling this palpable
uh uncertainty and economic anxiety in their lives and as a result of that we've started othering people
there's a rise in xenophobia there's a rise in a lot of online misogyny transphobia you know anti-immigrant
sentiment all over the world really uh and then blaming universities or woke or whatever all all
of these things where you gotta blame the other for the problems that you have in your life uh are
rising and that's no surprise i don't blame people for feeling resentful for feeling angry uh about the
conditions that our society is currently in and is going towards not to make this introduction overly
political because this episode isn't really a political one however i do recommend you go check
out this brilliant video essays called i do i don't know what the guy's real name is but especially if
you're australian he does brilliant really good video essays on australian politics and he just mentioned
that look it's not just him pointing out the problems like what a lot of these uh online political
shows and video essays tend to do he actually is giving solutions so the fact is that there are
tangible solutions uh there are solutions here for us in australia for starters uh by decommodify housing
and decoupling australian wealth the the individual wealth of people in australia from the housing market
that's a disaster because housing should not be an investment it should be something where people live in
houses aren't investments uh the fact that our industries in australia are not diverse at all
i believe our economic diversity is even below uganda uh we rely heavily on the mining industry
and relying on one single harmful industry like mining isn't going to create any kind of future for
our nation uh for our communities while at the same time we have a terribly unhealthy relationship to
gambling um and these are both economic and cultural changes that we need to make we as australians need
to understand that hey look i shouldn't be obsessed with having my wealth tied up to property and
investing rather you know maybe start seeing a house as a home a place where people live above all not an
economic tool to get passive income and at the same time also vote in politicians who do try and
decommodify housing and decouple our economy uh from the housing market we need to become a country
that's innovating building manufacturing and being economically diverse these aren't just political
issues they're both political and cultural always uh and also importantly as the british economist
gary stevenson has said many times we need to tax wealth not work people working is a good thing
people creating entrepreneurs small businesses people working class doing work is what runs an economy
it's what grows an economy is what makes a country uh wealthy we have to tax and redistribute wealth
that people are holding on to so that the majority of australians will have a better life
uh with all of that being said and again all of this is covered in adju's video essays i do again
really do urge you to go watch this stuff it's it's fantastic uh with all of that being said yes
these economic factors certainly play a big role in this but also we can't deny the fact that it's
not just economical or material it's also about identity and that is what this episode is about
it doesn't matter if you're a part of the british aristocracy you could be a part of the the us
rich elite one person whatever you could be a simple average working class australian person or
you could be an aboriginal australian every human being fundamentally faces this groundlessness of
existence this fundamental struggle with identity what am i doing here who am i what the hell am i supposed
to do and in fact the people that hold on to their identity even more the people that are overly
patriotic or overly kind of almost boastful about their identity be it their religion or their even
their sexuality or gender whatever these are the people that experience this fundamental anxiety of
identity even more uh their their zealousy you could say is a symptom of the fact that deep down they all
experience this groundlessness this abyss this void that's universal to all human beings and here's
where i would say i am a universalist and no doubt this anxiety translates to politics along with the
material difficulties this fundamental brutal fact of being human is a factor in how people vote and how
people form their political views and i think professor boothby being an existential philosopher beautifully
speaks to this human condition and also through this one understands why people have the political
views that they do and what we contend i think is simple your problems yes some of them perhaps most of
them are material problems they're problems caused by the economic conditions of the society we live in
and they could be solved politically they could be solved by a change in how we view wealth how we view
economics how we view politics and who we vote for as i did mention already but at the same time i think
it's also important to understand that this anxiety that we experience this groundlessness
it's not the fault of trans people it's not the fault of migrants it's not the fault of any of these
groups we try to otherize and we try to say it's therefore we try to scapegoat them
it's something that's universal to every human being and don't get me wrong i'm not saying you
should just live with it of course not in fact the next step once you identify this void or whatever
you may call it this groundlessness is to realize that your identity is found in relation to the other
in relation to yes of course your immediate family and community and your your nation but also the
other that you have no idea who they are the complete alien different other that you have
nothing in common with you can still find your identity in relation to these kinds of people to
the person that's that's just not like you and i think in this conversation that's what we fundamentally
propose so we can deal with this groundlessness this lack of self um with other people not
despite of them not by attacking them or scapegoating them but with them
um and i think no matter what your religion no matter what your uh let's call it sexual or gender
identity or whatever these identities are these things at some level don't really matter what
matters above all is your relationship to others and that's where your identity is found not what
you declare okay now i feel like i'm rumbling but i hope you can see my point here these issues
aren't these uh abstruse abstract philosophical matters but rather they're deeply material they're
deeply practical and we see them manifest in our politics uh and so when we do make our political
decisions while yes keep the economic stuff in mind also keep this broader existential question in mind or
this existential let's call it uh issue in mind as to how we choose our political uh parties and who we
vote for uh as far as voting is effective and i do believe in voting by the way and i hope you could see
why despite this not being a political episode i wanted to get this out well in advance of the
australian election be that as it may now a quick psa as you may know i've mentioned multiple times i'll
never have advertisers or sponsors on this podcast frankly i think we live in a society of excess and

supporters on patreon on sub stack and even paypal however if you're considering supporting the
project please do so only if you have the means all right back to the episode professor richard bootby is
a professor of philosophy at early university berlin who works in psychoanalysis philosophical psychology
phenomenology existentialism and contemporary carnal philosophy he's the author of death and desire
freud as philosopher blown away and numerous other books in this episode we discuss his religious work
as a response to christian nationalism and identity politics along with the book embracing the void
rethinking the origins of the sacred which todd mcgovern has said is the best psychoanalytic take on
religion and now with all of that being said and yes there was a lot here's my conversation with
professor richard bootby yeah thank you very much for being here as i said been following your work for
years uh came across you a couple years ago through todd mcgovern and then uh started listening to your
interviews um and then yeah as i was preparing for this um i was rereading your book embracing the void and
then as i emailed you i realized look you've already done some pretty good theoretical like technical
interviews uh with people who are way more qualified than i am and i thought you know might might as well
do a bit of a cultural have a bit of a cultural conversation which with what's going on right now in
the world so to speak uh and that's this i want to kind of perhaps present your reading of religion and christianity
uh as almost a juxtaposition with what we see kind of the christian nationalism or the
evangelical christianity and and whatnot um and yeah well we'll see where we go from here um but
firstly at a very general level professor um yeah look i mean i guess professionally or academically
you're not a theologian nor you really are uh let's say a person who explicitly does religious
studies or research in that regard however i'm curious uh what made you write a book on religion i'm
not sure if embracing the void is your first one specifically on religion uh but why do you think
that that's a topic that requires uh theorizing and thinking about and all the way to writing a
book about uh the the honest answer to that is it really had nothing to do with my scholarly background
or even um you know something of an intellectual project it was a personal event that got me going
with this um 18 years ago um my then 23 year old son um reached the limit of despair over a heroin addiction
and uh he had struggled for oh man at least eight years maybe closer to 10 years with um this uh affliction
various drug involvements that were really uh a ways for him to to control really terrible anxiety which
he started with when he first went to high school and when he by the time he got to be 23 he was um
very severely addicted in spite of um my wife and i uh putting him into a a a very um effective drug
treatment program where he temporarily really got free of drugs but he he couldn't uh stay uh clean and um
in his despair over his drug addiction uh he finally shot himself to death this was um three years
three and a half years after he and his girlfriend had a child um a young man who's just now uh graduating
from college my grandson jackson um so that's the the way this whole thing started um it really was my own
being shattered by grief and it took me many years to really even begin uh to get back on my feet i mean
somehow i could keep teaching which is sort of interesting that i could keep uh teaching courses
in philosophy but for those eight or ten years i wrote very little um i was just sort of absorbing this
sort of personal disaster and um this this personal you know um experience of loss and of death and loss
which really was shattering yeah it's interesting uh you know the kind of philosophy you do kind of
like phenomenology existentialism it's a bit hard to kind of like i don't know will you say when if you
you could like reflect on your former self in some sense like when there's that sort of trauma that
you use your work uh as almost a defense mechanism uh you know in in a way repressing that trauma or to
like avoid facing that trauma uh or or would you have found it even harder again given the kind of
work you do which is philosophy that does in certain points confront you know these issues of life and
death and being towards death in the heideggerian sense or like uh despair and all of this that's a good
question i i think basically um my background in philosophy and phenomenology and also very much my
background in psychoanalytic studies as i had read a great deal about uh psychological extremity
and either from an existential point of view or from a phenomenological or psychoanalytic point of
view i was i was already in the abstract familiar with some of what was happening to me now in brute reality
so i i think that was a saving grace for me actually i could uh even even as i was really
emotionally wrecked by my son's death uh i became i was i would say you know bolstered up i was held up
and and and supported by being able to pose certain questions um and follow a kind of a an attempt to
answer those questions that actually was quite a saving power for me even when i couldn't yet come up with
real answers it um it it made me feel like there were a lot of other people who had been
down dark paths before existentialists and so on that that really um faced uh faced death and suffering
and loss uh and i sort of felt i think a kind of kindred spirit with many of those people um the
existential tradition offers plenty of them and uh so that was actually i think somewhat
you know supportive for me um i began to try to to to to come to terms intellectually with what had
happened to me so disastrously uh in the domain of of emotion yeah yeah yeah i mean
it's interesting because obviously professor like not not most people uh i assume would go through
something as traumatic and as difficult as what you went through like losing a child right i mean
but at the same time i don't know like uh for example i know that you recently had a conversation
with the the negative psychoanalyst julie riche and when i spoke to her she kind of made this point
that it seems like in our culture so we have people who we would say not really you know people that
not not people in the psychoanalysis community but you would have people who say okay you have positive
emotions you experience the world in a positive sense but then uh then you also have negative
emotions and then her point as well in some sense uh i think she she calls it uh pessimistic realism or
something or a certain term she uses where it's like what if it's the person who is melancholic or
experiences the world with these more yeah negatively oriented emotions what if they see
the reality of existence in some sense uh instead of uh and i think there's there's a term for it i
forget the proper term she uses uh so i'm curious like you know you you speak of like despair and like
angst also in the book angst and then the void uh ultimately for you does i mean you you do even say uh
in fact i remember the the line from your book that all of being revolves around an impregnable void
would you say in some sense that's your walton shang and like this is kind of how you see uh all of
all of our being to be explained through this this fundamental let's call it ontological void wow that's a
lot to take on that's where you laid out a lot of things as it turns out um julie rish i just met her
this in the last few weeks and uh i must say i found her to be uh incredibly uh impressive i really
uh was grateful to have made a connection with her i had contributed uh an essay to a book that she's
been working on on death and love and uh i had but i hadn't personally connected with her and i found
her we had some conversations um via zoom that were um incredibly moving um and she then uh wrote a um
the beginnings in fact more than the beginning almost the entirety of a of a review uh of a
book that i wrote directly about my son's death called blown away um i haven't read it yeah oh you
have she she read it too and um uh she wrote a um a a review for it that that she wants to put a few
more you know finishing touches on it but it was an extraordinary review i felt so grateful and um
just kind of awed by her capacity to enter this space and you're right in what you just were saying
that the big lesson for me of my own personal loss was about how how how human beings can and and have to at
some point in life cope with loss and find meaning in and through loss um and i've i found julie uh
russia to be really a kind of a genius she lives it she's um amazing in that respect um her capacity to
enter that space um of of a kind of empty and a rather terrifying um existential position
yes yeah yeah i mean i think because i've been trying to sort of see uh even your work through
her lens and in fact now the term it came to me it's called depressive realism because the void you speak of
it's it's more the dusting you know that sort of as it's it's a bit different to the kind of what
she speaks of but then you're right uh i feel like through her work she is providing a place to um
situate or house this kind of despair that all humans universally uh experience i think we lost you
for a moment there you just passed out again yeah all right yeah i think i'm back sorry a bit off
today uh but no i was just saying regarding like providing a space for that um for that despair and
in fact another thing i can pull in here is even byongshul han in his really famous short book uh the
burnout society he speaks of how in many ways all of society is kind of this now we live in this new
liberal hyper positivity where there isn't a place for what you would call a negativity
or any kind of there's this other side that's as equally real or perhaps even more real to all the
positive emotions that we experience and so it's i think you're right she's beautifully carving out a
space uh uh for for that kind of work uh but yeah sorry i didn't mean to like go on a bit of a segue
and you know take us uh off track here but back to religion and this is really what i kind of want
to focus on professor so yes you say that you know you connect the void to religion now that is
quite interesting given at least before i came across this sort of the lacanian psychoanalytic world
the kind of religion that i've experienced has been more of a a positive joyful religion where it's
it's you know the the pentecostal charismatic churches where you go you know god will save you
uh you know people are singing songs and or hymns so uh people like it's almost like a celebration
of of god uh never have i heard of the term void ever being used you know in a church here in
australia so so i'm curious yeah i mean in fact uh they would probably even even they'll probably
say it's the other way around where the void is if you're a uh a dirty secular atheist you know
you won't go to come and fill that hole and go to come and fill you know in the pascalian sense
but i'm curious so what's this again to a person who has no idea about any of the
psychoanalytic theory or the philosophy none of that just when you introduce this void into speaking
of religion what's the relationship you make make between the two i think yeah that's another great
question it leads me i think to the main point i um what i experienced in the loss of my son
was both the worst thing that ever happened to me but i would have to say it was also one of the most
i guess it was the most valuable thing that ever happened to me and what i mean by that is that i came
i was forced really to realize that my initial immense pain and sadness and sense of loss
was even the very emotional you know force of those negative feelings they were actually less
uh a matter this is going to sound very strange but i think it's it was it's accurate to what i
experienced i those terrible feelings were less simply what the loss had forced upon me then then a
position i want i i wanted to to adopt as if i was paying for it as if i was making up for my own
weaknesses and my own failures and it took some years for me to realize this but i realized that
my my son himself as a person in the relationship that we had that was the important thing yes i was
heartbroken that he had died prematurely that he suffered this you know terrible
life trauma extending over years of his addiction and finally killed himself i mean all that was
terrible however in the end um i found myself simply remembering my son and in a certain
holy spiritual way refinding him in the things he used to love i would he had a he had a thing about
clouds i comment on this and in blown away that memoir about his death he loved clouds and i found
myself seeing clouds in a new way this took years after his death but it did happen and i now would say
that to put it really in a nutshell i would say this sounds very to me like like like books of kierkegaard
it was going down into the depths of loss and agony that i actually found myself renewed
in my sense of the beauty of nature the infinite sort of value of other people and the experiences that
we can have with other people in various ways and and just the sort of magic of being alive i would have to
say that my son's death and his his is is being pulled out of my life paradoxically brought him back
eventually to the very core of my life and uh i would say that i am
to use the word happy it sounds almost obscene but i would say
his loss led to his kind of um a very rich and moving return you know in a very strange way
that i felt like i would look through the through through his eyes at the world and he kind of uh
rejuvenated and re you know um re-enlivened me um and it made me realize a lot of very fundamental
things about the religious the religious posture that that it made me realize that religion does start
with with suffering and it has to pass through a kind of desperate uh feeling uh in which we are
deeply pained by existence and but on the other side of that it's very possible and i feel like i've
experienced it to come to the other side and you find everything in life is infinitely more precious
infinitely more speaking infinitely more beautiful and uh infinitely valuable uh as if the real path to uh
to love and uh and beauty and the core of life requires us to pass through some terrible darkness
yeah yeah i mean okay i i kind of want to touch on identity now and and the reason i say this is
uh because like you see it seems like for me when i experience the world day to day i have this deep
cognitive dissonance in in this sense i mean uh you know i'd read like a book like yours uh more of a
existentialist philosophical work uh and then i would also see what i'd hear from popular culture
um about identity uh and and then you know to connect this to religion i would say you know a lot of
people say i i identify as a christian or or the people that kind of uh let's say become more political
they would say uh yeah i'm a i'm a a christian an australian christian or even the australia is
quite secular but the same way your your nation is an identity for some some of us that their um
their religion religion is also an identity so that this is probably where you see nationalism and
someone's religion uh being connected or that there's this like almost like interesting
relationship between the both of them and then you see movements like you know the christian
christian nationalist movement uh which again is an identity it's it's an identity for people and for me
especially after i've come across a lot of the psychoanalytic literature it's it's like i can see why
people cling on to that identity because again you speak of the dusting or the objea the lack the void
these things we we need we need a way for us to deal with these things and even in the book you do
speak about how like you know a lot of these identities people cling on to are symptomatic of
this fundamental core of of being this this this void so would you say for you um after thinking about
this for all these years that religion is still some sort of identity or or would you not want to
speak of religion in any way uh in terms of it being some sort of a personal identity one holds on to
uh or how would you how would you speak of that
well i maybe i'll risk making a really dangerous statement about that dangerous because it could
be misinterpreted so easily almost inevitably um i remember uh as i said my my son died now 18 years ago
and uh maybe 10 or 12 years into that um period this period of of loss and mourning
i not only came out of the darkness of it and the sheer sense of loss the serious sense of of of
of a really terrible soul suffering i kind of came out of that the way the way the clouds can kind of
part and the sun comes back through again nothing that i did exactly but something that's happened to me
something that was done to me by life itself and i um i began to see the things differently
and i remember i was walking by myself in my own uh neighborhood here in baltimore and um i i it was the
oddest thing i suddenly realized well of course there is something like god but this is what's so
difficult is i wasn't i wasn't saying oh i've become a christian or i've become a mormon or i've become
jewish or i've become a catholic nothing of that sort it's it was sort of a a very subtle but very
decisive realization that there is there is a kind of um infinite value and infinite something that we
infinitely share with being where we're we're part of something bigger and
i still of course i don't identify with any religion uh that is to say you know traditions and and their
trappings of of guidance for uh ritual and so on and so forth all of that still remains to me rather um
unhelpful but the sense that um that life does at its core have a kind of living essence that we participate
in if we're open to it um and it's possible in every relationship that we have with a fellow human
being it's possible to touch this unfortunately i think what you've been calling in the last couple
of questions you've posed contemporary popular culture or the contemporary culture in which
a certain kind of sensibility about existence is being continually advertised to us and basically sold
to us is a disaster when it comes to what i'm talking about that we're we're constantly uh given mass you
know endless messages uh in in in everything from advertising to political and especially i think
religious expressions we're kind of asked to uh to to embrace this kind of uh payoff if we only have the
right faith or you only have the right in the right we're in the right clan you know we're in the right
right we're the right church that we're going to be kind of like um we're going to be saved and what i've
i think i've learned at least for myself is that to be saved is the path to feeling saved is the path to
realizing that you're part of something that is yeah infinitely beyond us we don't understand it
it's the heart of nature it's the heart of being and time and um and i think it's less likely to
these days to encounter it in a church than it is out in the woods uh in that sense maybe i'm kind of
joining for a thorough and emerson or something i'm much more um more open to uh the experience of nature
and of course the experience of one another our fellow human beings absolutely yeah i mean i have
a lot of questions on this question of the other and the neighbor will we'll get there for sure but
i just want to make this point a bit of a tangent again um yeah i love the one reason i love you
know your work for sure but also even todd mcgovern's excellent book uh on hegel the menstruation after
hegel uh is that you know it's really interesting right like almost the caricature of let's call it
leftism is this like uh oh there are you know this infinite identities uh you know it's it's it's sold to us
at least by popular culture as being like a very particularist hyper individualistic kind of uh
worldview where you have this gender that gender or you know we have um you know it's a very pluralistic
kind of society they're trying to build however i think it's quite the opposite where the true
particularists are in fact what i would just say christian nationalists or islamic nationalists
so any kind of nationalists who who as you say uh posit that no my identity this is the true
identity and you always create a boundary between yourself and the other and then you say within my
particular identity this is where i find i don't know salvation or i find the truth or whatever you
may call it whereas the the kind of the in my view the authentic the true leftist universalism that i
see a lot in in your work even though i know you're not an overtly political uh philosopher but still i see
the politics that kind of let's call it uh is is comes out of it in many ways is that yeah there is
something there is a i don't know we we can't really say what it is for sure but there is something
that is fundamentally universal to all human beings all cultures uh and uh you know you even make this
point in embracing the void where you say look this this is not going to be uh an exegesis of some kind of
comparing all worldly religions it's not uh you even point out the point that like home makes that's
a useless thing to do you can't just compare religions and try to find the best out of whereas
you you speak to this fundamental this let's call that the unknowing that lies at the core of reality and
that is regardless of which which culture or a part of where you come from and this is i find this to be
so true and i'm a migrant to australia so obviously i i've moved here when i was younger from sri lanka
and you know it's i guess now it's you can't say this anymore but at least in the past it was a
non-western culture however these themes of like unknowing the void and then more than more than that
how people respond to the void how people react to the void by clinging on to some kind of nationalism
or at its in its worst case some some sort of fascist kind of movement is is a way we uh try to
avoid facing it avoid embracing it as you would say in your book um so um and i and i just think that
that's certainly yeah i don't know if you want to comment on that but i think it's it's a beautiful
kind of project that that you and your fellow travelers are engaged in this universalist project
yes and and yes you're right to say that uh i'm joining a a crowd of other people who have discovered
this way before i was born that identity that identity is actually uh a false promise i i i i i
i don't think i'm ever going to uh waste any more time over my identity i don't think i i i don't think
i have one in fact i think that the the obsession of contemporary popular culture at least in in in
my culture in the united states identity is a is the goal is the holy grail for everyone and i find myself
just completely disinterested in it like i don't even know anymore what we're talking about
other than something about oneself that you can feel proud of uh that also seems foreign to me i i i
i guess i'm i'm so these days
i'm an old man now you know i'm 70 years old now and uh i i think like many people who
get old enough things drop into a much more
grounded and and and i think authentic perspective and i must say identity seems to me to be
worse than a waste of time what we really need to do is encounter the other uh the kind of the other
with a capital o and uh and be swept up into it somehow to its beauty and its grandeur and its mystery
um it doesn't have a name it doesn't have a a church it doesn't have a political party uh but it makes
the difference all the difference in being a human being yeah it's funny how these things lead to almost
let's call it contradictions because i've always believed this this search for identity this almost
incessant uh pursuit of identity is in fact the let's call it a sine qua non to come to this
realization that identity doesn't exist however i think that's unfortunately a bit too optimistic
because the truth is i think it's radically open this search can lead one perhaps to the position which
i would say is in many ways the religious view or the authentically religious view or the christian view
that is it's about the other uh completely about the other and and not once the identity you declare
but then also as we see now in the world unfortunately professor it is it is fascism it is it's it's
nationalism it is this kind of particularist where you say you know leave out the i don't know the
migrants or trans people or in its worst cases even women and like misogyny in that regard and
it's um yeah so it is it is i do think that in many ways perhaps we humans can't not keep looking for
identity uh but the question is what what do we like what what does that lead to and and that i think is
radically open it could be yes the more than what i would call it the religious view or something like
which again has actually psychologically a religious structure to it as people like uh i don't know and
even like jack has pointed out hmm i had some um great luck in my life um one of them things i was lucky in
was i was when i was in college i spent the summers at a very special school um in new hampshire it was
called the hampshire country school and it was uh originally founded for troubled kids
uh kids uh kids who had psychological or sometimes also legal uh problems and and really needed to get
out of the system out of their their their hometown school system and up into the woods of new hampshire
and i think that the the people there was a a couple elderly couple when i joined them
uh whose vision it was that uh that that the secret of of of growing up and finding out anything about
yourself uh becoming a person was a matter of of becoming really real related intimately with nature
with other people and with doing things with other people in nature so we we would go i remember i was
uh for a couple of those summers taking a little group of maybe six or eight of the kids uh just out
camping for a week while you know hiking through the new hampshire mountains and and uh and camping
and the i think the point of it was really actually we never quite put it this way we never theorized
it you might say but the point was precisely to put the emphasis on experiencing the world and not
worrying about yourself that that that stewing about and being anxious about your how other people saw
you was a a kind of a trap uh that was just going to bring uh bad feelings and self-loathing
but getting out into the world and uh particularly with a group of others with whom you're really sharing
the adventure uh it made me realize that that if that we should have every group of young people in a
school like this we shouldn't be lining them up in these these desks in the classrooms and then
keeping a grade book about their their average of uh
uh group quiz and and exam scores we should be uh really giving them experiences with their fellow
comrades you know in a in in in in the nature of the world and uh i really i must say i've been kind of
radicalized by by my own experience and into thinking that our our current culture and particularly
our formative culture for our kids which we leave half the tv and half these kind of dead schools
uh which are more like uh incarcerations than real introductions to the world we really i think have
to radically change our outlook and i i i think if i live long enough to write another couple of books
books i'd like to write about this problem about how uh what would it really mean to cultivate soul
in young people because i don't think that's a i don't think that's an impossible thing to do and uh i
think that what we're doing now is um increase generally though we don't set out to do it we end up
in increasing their sense of anxiety increasing their sense of of a kind of panic of their own ego
and then difficulty of relating to others and it seems to me that you know we're asleep to um
how bad we've allowed things to get
yeah so how about if i say now let's say i put on the the mask or i take on the persona again for more
of a christian nationalist type which i see it again unfortunately growing in the west and even even
in india there's hindu nationalism a terrible problem so it's not a western phenomenon for sure
it's it's a universal problem nationalism and this clinging on identity and because i think what you
identify professor this sort of hyper individualization this kind of atomized existence that modernity
and capitalism has created for us both now it's the right left whoever everyone identifies this
all the way from a an evangelical christian to some like techno utopian type that's in silicon valley
they've identified this it's problem with the the the the self being siloed from the world and
so a christian nationalist let's say i'm speaking as one would say oh therefore what we need is for
young people we need to we need them we need them to be patriotic we need to inculcate pages we need
we them to need them to embrace not the void in this case embrace their nation embrace the religion
they were born into be it christianity or hinduism or islam or whatever uh we need to we need them to
feel proud of uh like their culture or their upbringing their roots their heritage so i i think for me this
is what i see like the arguments i see for example this is why we see strong men coming into power
the trumpian types because we want someone uh to say to say uh this is this is you know stop feeling
sorry for yourself you know embrace it i think i lost you for a bit there but i'm back uh sorry the
connection is a bit off yes you got me for a bit but i totally agree with you and my analysis of that
is when young people find in their own search for identity that there's not enough there to really
save them because of course of one my my basic argument is that that that looking for one's
own identity is a fool's errand in some very important sense but then they they they want that
to get that identity in the identity of the group which is of course infinitely worse they're then uh
the the the dolls the puppets of of the the the identity the collective identity they've signed on to
and they're really lost what we need i think is uh is to reverse a lot of this the contemporary
conception of personal identity and and really we need to see things differently i think that the east
the asian um countries and their traditions strike me as much closer uh to especially you know uh zen
buddhism is an especially promising kind of example of this but but to have the idea that if that by
ourselves we're nothing and we should that's what we are actually i think that the the existentialists
who who kind of almost almost challenged us with this this idea they're still correct that we
we are in a way a kind of void to be a person is to be in a sense a void but that's also it's
fantastic strength and richness the void into the void can one can have this appreciation of the
beauty of nature and the preciousness of our fellow human beings when we really interact with them um
the trouble is we get caught up in these these these efforts to try to define ourselves
and uh be part be part of some group that that reinforces all of that indeed indeed and you
you make a really good point this where we look for that identity in the group and paul tillick
from all people i think made this point early on uh in in the in the rise of nazi germany um before
even it became what it was and i think he writes about this in his uh book the courage to be too
where yes yes i'm finding identity in yourself you start looking for it in the group and that again
it does leave to to a it's it's it's a fool's errand as you say but also it leads to something quite
destructive um yeah thank you thank you professor that's beautiful okay now this part's really important
for me because uh you know you you touch on this in the topic of the neighbor and the other of course
it's it really underlies so much of your work but especially uh embracing the void uh and then i
recall you even mention um i think you talk about character guards uh works of love and how christianity
there's almost something even scandalous when you when you speak of the other and the neighbor and
love um so yeah in in the world again if if i'm presenting this position to someone who uh you
know right now person people the type of mindset that we are attacking which is the that's called the
christian nationalism how would you say for them to consider uh the neighbor how how would you you say
for someone like that to think of the neighbor in your in your view in the christian sense
well i one of the my immediate temptation is to begin an answer to that with with yes christian
nationalism but even just starting with christian gives us a huge challenge because i'm convinced that
and i this is the point that i make in embracing the void when i talk about christianity i think that
i think that what we have as christianity as one of the world's religions in fact the most
populous one the largest group i'm convinced more and more that that that the the basic message of
this wandering rabbi if we want to call him that jesus wandering around nazareth he was betrayed by paul
by taking paul taking away the real message which has to do with how we allow ourselves and challenge
ourselves to turn to the other with true openness with true heart with true caring and see what what's
happening that this happens together when uh instead paul uh effectively takes the salvation theme and
infinitizes it taking it as if we're being called by by the pauline you know um notion of salvation in the
next life that we're being removed from this one uh i feel like that the the real message of jesus was
something much more of course in some sense much more humble uh but that's exactly where its great strength
was um and we've we've allowed ourselves to be kind of intoxicated with this this uh appeal to the the
transcendent infinite when it's right in front of us we don't have to go to another world we're right in
the only world yes yes and and yeah so again that the question of the neighbor and the other i mean i
guess for you it's like you you try to find it in the other isn't it in the neighbor this whatever that
we're looking for in the other world yes in them and in oneself i mean it's i don't mean to say that
we should never you know somehow talk and think and devote ourselves to ourselves of course there's
a way in which we we are right to to seek to become more truly ourself but the problem and i think you
i'm glad to hear you you also talk about it this way that the demand of the identity culture
uh i think is a real uh a false uh promise and and even worse than that it's a kind of
road to uh to ruin what what it takes to actually be oneself ironically or deeply paradoxically
is to be in relation with another and others it's to find ourselves in a world where we can recognize
its beauty and uh and its challenges um and not become obsessed with anxiety over our identity
yeah i agree i mean it's funny like it's really we're going to be having a federal election in may so
recently see like a lot of people uh it's not thank god as as obscene as in the u.s kind of the political
campaigning here it's uh no offense to your nation i envy you yeah it's it's certainly not at that level
it's uh however of course there is still a bit of campaigning and more from the again i'd say the the
right-wing parties they're saying i've even seen now people go to the extent of saying this recently
i saw a friend of mine who is more in so our liberal party is our right-wing party saying that
australia is a christian nation but then and this is this again goes back to my uh cognitive resonance
what i mean by this is because first of all just empirically what i experience i don't see this as being
a christian nation in fact australia like the u.s is a multicultural nation uh that's that's really
fundamentally what we are it's it's this mix of mix of difference pluralism uh yes they certainly are
christians but they're also you know other faiths uh and then um my other question of course
or my other my struggle here is like i don't you know as much as i even i still would say i'm some
kind of a christian but at least that's that's a religion that i'm most familiar with or most
intimate with however i certainly wouldn't even want to live in a christian nation because as you
point out it's you find you find the this transcendental aspect of existence so this what
we are looking for in the god or the divine you find it in the other indifference and if i lived in
in a completely unipolar or a kind of a a culture of sameness life would for me be it would lose so
much of richness and substance and it would be frankly rather boring if australia truly was a
christian nation i probably wouldn't want to live here because what i what i love about this country
is the difference the multiculturalism and and this again is why uh i don't know as much as i love
theory and philosophy these days i'm trying to put forward more of a political message through these
conversations as to yeah consider this when you speak of uh migrants or trans people or all these
communities we're trying to otherize in our contemporary political dialogue hmm well we have um we have i'm
i mean even i'm looking uh around in your uh own library there and um uh seeing a lot of familiar books
actually um you know reading the right thing can be such a deliverance such an uh such a an enrichment
of the soul um but we uh we really have to rethink uh a lot of things that we we we've known for years
our problems you know cons the whole consumerist mentality that we have to buy the right thing
whether it's clothing or or or music machines or iphones or whatever it is we need we need that
you know it's the old story of of consumption and commercial uh marketing and so on that we we
you know in so many ways we have to get back to some very simple things um
and of course as we also know online exchange and and media is has become the giant pump that fills our
our souls with all of this uh rubbish this kind of longing for having the right thing that will make
everything meaningful um it's the precise opposite of course um anyway i um i feel like i feel like i also
um need to be more focused on this theme um and not in a scholarly book my my my sense for the future if i
i what i have left is to um is to try to tackle these questions these questions ultimately they're
questions of soul uh but soul as something that we don't defer to another life but soul as something we
should be living right now what is what does it mean to have soul it has i think everything to do with a
certain kind of a certain kind of relationship to other people which is i think what you're talking
about when you talk about the variety of different traditions and religions and sensibilities in
australia uh so the relation to other people and the relation to to nature to the plants and animals and
and and and and and and the heavens above i mean all of this is the earth is uh is what we we need to
draw allow ourselves to be drawn out into that and enriched by it um and yes i hope to find some ways of
expressing these ideas free from the sort of academic paradigm that i've uh produced in in the past
yeah valuable it might be in some some way i really need to develop a different voice i think
yeah but regardless professor i mean i would say uh i don't really read that call i don't really read
him much uh because i i am as much as i love reading on psychoanalysis i don't really read much of
lacanian theory because he's pretty hard to read however you know people like yourself in your book uh
uh freud as freud the philosopher uh freud as a philosopher uh and then people like todd mcgovern
for sure i just love his stuff it is very clear i i still very much do defend theory
uh i think uh theory doesn't have to be this uh abstruse abstract thing it can be it's something
fundamentally that's it's real to our lives it's something that we we probably experience day to day
so uh i i wouldn't yes i agree with that yeah i wouldn't say that you know theory is just something
that's left just within the academic uh realm of a university it's something which all of us can
experience that ways uh beautiful all right so i think we've spoken a lot about the other however two
other big things you introduce in embracing the void which again i love reading about was the notion of
mystery and unknowing now i was gonna ask this is probably a big ask so i apologize but i think
it's in part one of embracing the border if i'm not mistaken you sort of do a somewhat of a almost
like a genealogy of the unknown you go from all the way from uh of the concept of the unknown you speak
of even from the uh uh you know the ancient greek greek religions greek antiquity you come all the way
to the abrahamic religions and then even finally to capitalism which is our religion of the day so
uh i mean i'm not going to make you do a whole genealogy of the unknown in this
conversation i mean read the book if you want to have one but if you want to you know um go through
one however if you could speak a bit on the unknown and why you even say fundamentally we need to
embrace the unknown and yeah what's the unknown uh you know it's interesting i would i i do feel like
i have a better response to this than i did when i was writing embracing the void in spite of the fact
that embracing the void is absolutely centered on this um i i now would say that what i call unknowing
then the embrace of unknowing in that book i certainly you know i i still believe that that's a
a useful kind of a useful gesture a useful uh a kind of a kind of a like a crowbar with which you're
going to uh open something up and learn something new but i would now say it's not simply the unknown
it's it's how much we can open ourselves to it it's a personal uh expansion where you allow yourself
to receive things to perceive things to experience things it's a kind of openness to life that's really
at stake without judging it without even without necessarily desiring anything but simply being open
to it this is a lot of what i in that book continually refer to as as living in the face of the unknown
um you know the unknown is a little bit too abstract i think in a way it's it has to do with one's own
openness in this sense i i've i guess i feel like i've become again as i was 50 years ago when i first
discovered him i've become reopened to heidegger in this precise sense that heidegger uh in being in
time that that that's such a a lovely theme i don't think he finally uses it his own i don't think he
i think he loses some of his own advantage uh in his own promise um i think many people have pointed
that out but i still feel like that notion of the clearing in which one opens allows oneself to be
you know participant in the clearing in into which something unexpected will show itself uh that's in
a way the whole game and i um i feel like that's where we have an infinite task to learn and the
greatest thing of all is that it's infinitely simple if one really kind of realizes what's at stake
it's just an opening of one's own eyes opening of one's own heart yeah i mean it's funny um you know
when you when i was reading uh uh embracing the water and when you were talking on the unknown
obviously for me because i'm some sort of uh obsessional neurotic i i i think of unknowing
still in like a very empirical sense in the sense that okay there's all this knowledge that i need to
acquire so i've got to collect all this knowledge and eventually my unknowing will be annoying
but then of course i know that you in in no way do you mean in that way but rather it's an it's
almost an uh an existential orientation and that's why you speak of heidegger here uh and again this is
why this is you can't really separate these categories or concepts it again goes back to the
other because i don't know what you think of this professor but one thing i've realized is this is
where you suddenly you're met with the unknown or you're being open to the unknownness
you know i think kakakak speaks of this in the works of love where when you think of you know
loving thy neighbor it's not loving someone that's just like you it's not really the neighbor and like
the immediate sense of the neighbor you can just get along with you know pretty nice decent guy whoever
but rather it's almost like loving loving an alien it's almost loving someone that you just
it's it's it's like a complete unknowingness to their existence that you can never say oh
oh they're just like me because the whole liberal uh i would call it pseudo universalism is so we all
the same we all want the same things yeah uh and but for me no not at all uh i mean that the unknowing
lies that the unknowing that lies at the core of being is that we are in fact quite different we don't
want absolutely i totally agree with that the the idea that that the problem is that we have to to uh
you know reach out and find in the other you know a perfect reflection of ourselves of course it's
it's the total opposite it's to uh is to be open to discovering that the person you're across the table
from is very different from you in some really key ways of course it's possible for an open heart
to be moved and to understand those differences but they're nevertheless differences of experience and
differences of life uh orientation and so on yeah i totally agree it's the the adventure
you get lost when you uh when you aren't simply and it is simple simply open to the to the other
person sitting across the table yeah and i think we experience this best at least i have is when you find
let's call it a almost an unknowing uh in someone you thought you knew really well like you could be
an honest partner or someone that you know like for example with like with me with my partner
i mean it could be oh yeah i know how she's she's you know we've been together but then suddenly you
should do something that just is or i do something where it's just like it completely
goes against your uh almost idealized imaginary image of who your partner was and that's where
you see that it really appear out of nowhere there's like the unknowing and at the core of the other
yeah yeah that's right that's right in in a way it's we miss it because it's the simplest thing
and it's we miss it precisely because it's what is absolutely right in front of us correct yeah yeah
somehow we insist on going over jumping over that and demanding some other thing
um yeah it's and this also i think connects well to your point about yeah when when we speak of like
you know this like transcendental experience or a transcendent experience or the divinity
it's like you don't have to go beyond this world it can be just in the most immediate thing you experience
it's very uh you know phenomenological quasi slash existential there all right beautiful uh in the
interest of time professor i kind of want to um get into a little bit of theory here uh only because
i mean i can't not discuss this when i have richard booth be on the podcast uh i'm curious i know you've
touched on this before in many of your conversations but i still would love for you to just
perhaps you know slightly comment on this uh the difference between uh dusting which is crucial to
your work and then objr i mean you write on both of these concepts uh yeah i mean in your view uh
it seems to me at least that you give dusting more of a place more salience than objr or am i
mistaken or how do you view these two concepts in lacanian theory well first of all i i think it's too
bad um i think too bad that lacan didn't illuminate this very question you're asking more because it's very
clear uh although only in a very few mentions a very few brief texts where he even brings them
together you know there's the famous one i think it's from the 18th seminar where he says that um
the obje eye is what tickles dust ding from the inside as if you know the obje eye is the kind of
more specific example of something that really causes you to stop a minute and say to yourself
what is this who is this how do i relate to this um he did see and and occasionally he lets us know
that he thinks of these things as intimately connected but he never develops it to any extent
and i think that's a sad thing um because i think they're they're very very they are very tied that
to take dust ding at the heart of the human being to take this this lack this hollow this lat this this
sense of of unknowing that inhabits all of us at our deepest moment our inner moment
this is what he means i think to say with the concept of dust ding and it's absolutely crucial
also to say it's not simply the the otherness that i do not know in the in the person across from me
it's my own other my own unknown in myself that's at stake i am occupied i am a mystery to myself
every much every bit as much as the person sitting across the table is from me that's what he means by
dusting but then again i can also say uh just the last thing and i'll i'll let you ask another question
but it strikes me that lacan does i think emphasize le petit a more than he lets the dusting kind of sink
back back and he wants to say my real contribution is objea why did he do that i think he does it
because he thinks and i also agree with this and i'm kind of falling into it when i wrote that book
dusting is more abstract it's closer to heidegger yes absolutely and this is what lacan decided was was
was what he wanted to take a step away from how is this duck uh uh le petit a the objea how is that
different it's different in the sense that what he wants with that concept is he wants us he invites us
us to notice the little the little thing the little detail the way the way the person sitting across
is is sitting sitting with their legs crossed too tight or whether they lean too too much on their elbow
or the way that they they keep you know playing with their scruff of day-old beard or something i don't know
but there's some the little thing that strikes you that you you don't know what it signifies it's a trivial thing
but it's nevertheless something that's worth allowing to kind of enter into you and be a bit curious about
uh it announces them as someone different uh it announces them in a way that perhaps if you have the
courage you can take as not itself a problem that you have to solve but just an indicator that this is
somebody who about whom you don't understand everything in fact you they present you a kind of
mystery that's the whole point it seems to me yeah yeah yeah i mean also i think you uh when mentioned
this notion of figure that there's someone there it kind of announces it to you where you write about
yeah imagine you're uh taking a walk in in nature somewhere and then you hear maybe a twig uh you
know snap or like some leaves rustle or whatever and then you suddenly realize there's someone there
and how immediately that just changes your almost your your phenomenological your mode of being the moment
you realize that there's something else that that's that's not me uh and yeah that that's beautifully
announced uh okay so yeah i want to ask when i was reading embracing the void for the second time
uh what i found interesting was i was trying to make a few connections between uh todd mcgovern's book
uh embracing alienation i don't know if you read this book and i'm curious look at the amount of tabs i've
got on it it's one of my favorite books i've recently read yeah i was even telling top that like
the people that aren't too inclined towards theory and philosophy and whatnot now the book that i do
gift is this one again because it's a clear book and you don't really need to be obsessed with theory
the way we are to kind of read this book and get the idea but yeah so he says embracing alienation
and you say embracing the void a lot of embracing here so are you both are you both talking of a
similar sort of thing i mean in fact let me just ask you this uh how do you view the idea of alienation
which we see from all the way from marx to hegel how how does that click with you let's say
also i i think uh as you may know i'm very close friends with todd and i have enormous respect for
his his work uh and what he calls alienation there is extremely overlapping it's if not identical in just
a different uh sort of a turn of phrase to what i'm trying to to get at in the way that we discover
in us we should we should be open to what in the other and in oneself is un
what shall we say unknown but something announces its own otherness and this i think is what he means
there it's a one way of translating the alienation in the title that alienation is uh is the is the
experience of not having things wrapped up not having things neatly understood but rather the awkward
moment when you realize i don't really know this about myself or about my friend um and this is yes
exactly what i'm trying to uh to emphasize that that to be alive uh in relation to another or
interestingly even to be alive in and in a relation to yourself you have to be open to this
not knowing what you're feeling what this person is trying to tell you what the relation between us
is and what it means none of that is is pat none of that is you know easily understood it's all kind
of a question mark and that question mark feeling it and really allowing it to upset you a bit and set you
in motion in some way i think that's what todd is talking about ultimately with alienation
absolutely yeah yeah in fact that upset you a bit and i think that's where
it's a good kind of upsetting because the point that makes especially i think in chapter five is a
beautiful chapter by like how we all experience alienation in the public you know in a public bus or in
uh in public transport let's say and in fact he's very clear with this is like even you know leftists
they you know talk about capitalism it alienates us and we need to overcome this alienation uh we need to
uh you know create a system where people aren't alienated and his whole point is that well no in fact the
violence the violence is done when you try to overcome this insurmountable alienation and here's
where i connected to what you write on the void and the embracing the unknowing it's that embracing
doesn't mean you say oh yeah there's unknowing and then you try to like almost empirically as i
mentioned before try to like uh you know gain wisdom and become like a wise guy or something where
then suddenly you don't know uh but rather it is just sitting sitting with that discomfort and even
seeing the value in unknowing and the discomfort and what how you could make your life perhaps richer
if you could look at it in that way um and and again so i think as i was saying i can see why this
book is a religious book because for me here's where i still think there's a place for religion is that
you need the religious language to speak of this there probably isn't you can't speak of it
theoretically or technically or even scientifically that's kind of unknowing the the at the core of
being and perhaps religion is let's call it to use a term in cognitive science the psychotechnology
that we have to speak of this uh this this this unknowing um i hope that's true um but i i'm a little
uh in other words i hope that there are strands and and potentials in the religions that we've inherited
that will still open this um this will allow this openness but i um i think of it really these days i
think of it maybe more uh less as as as something that that religion has a lot to teach us i'm sure it
does somewhere but i know that's true and and it will be great if we can make good on some of what
religion has to offer us but the but the metaphor that comes to me first of all is not the seriousness
of the religious it's the open innocence of play and that that the problem with religion is that
we get so easily over serious about it i don't mean to simply dismiss uh serious things but but
especially in our relations with others and our relation with ourself i think we need a an emphasis
an emphasis a new a new legitimizing of the playful the occasional the the the the the small the the
poetry with a small p you know it's the enjoyment of the simple and and and everyday moments that we
that just strike us we don't know why and we can sit with them a bit and uh and drink them in and let them
affect us indeed indeed yeah yeah yeah i wonder if jesus ever said a joke like in the bible is there
is there a place where he ever made a joke i mean i guess in buddhism there's uh what's the laughing
buddha who you know yes right right yes i'm sure in buddhism is much better on that score
that's right it has a place for play there are some certain uh let's call it variants of it which
um yeah professor this has been great thank you so much for your time and uh yeah i'm sorry if i'm
embarrassing you here but like apart from being a a brilliant philosopher you're just a beautiful
person so thank you so much for uh your time i really appreciate this well um i've really enjoyed it
myself and um you you brought out things in me that um i think um you you brought out my better half i
would say i appreciate it that's indeed the intent
