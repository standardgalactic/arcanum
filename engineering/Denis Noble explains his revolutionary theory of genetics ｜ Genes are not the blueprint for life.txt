And that is the fundamental reason why it's incorrect to describe them as selfish, either metaphorically or literally.
So, genes are not the blueprint for life.
And that is the title, believe it or not, the top science journal in the world, in February of this year, published an article with precisely that title.
They knew exactly what the editors were doing, because, in effect, they were announcing the end of 80 years, at least, of misunderstanding the fundamentals of biology.
And this talk is going to reveal to you why that statement is true.
Because standard biology, I'm sad to say, because I'm a biologist myself, taught students over 60 years now, has got causation upside down.
Genes, to quote Richard Dawkins, genes create us body and mind.
I reply, we control them and change them when we need to.
So, the structure of the talk is going to be that, since, as I will show, genes are not the blueprint of life,
measuring them and their association scores with common diseases, which is something biologists do a lot now,
cannot work for the purpose for which it was intended.
And I'll first explain why that is the case, and then conclude by showing that, statistically, anyway, with a study from University College London,
it doesn't succeed even in predicting common diseases.
And since that approach fails, and that's the reason why the IAI has asked me to come and give this talk today,
what is the alternative, what can biologists now do to deliver what we've failed to do?
And the answer is going to be to switch to investigating the functional networks in organisms that control the genome and enable it to be edited.
And to show how that can be done, that there is hope on the horizon,
I will choose to close with two very interesting examples of what physiologists can achieve.
So, just a little bit of 101 biology.
What exactly is the genome?
For those of you who need to be reminded,
it is, of course, a very long, thin thread of molecules called nucleotides,
because they're in the nucleus.
And there are four types.
You don't need to know the actual names.
A, T, G, and C.
And in humans, you and me,
and many other animals too,
there are at least three billion nucleotides.
That's an important figure for a bit later in the talk.
All our cells, except for the red blood cells,
contain a complete set of those.
Now, the important thing to realize is,
as chemicals, because that's what they are,
they can only do what chemicals naturally do.
Their associations and dissociations from other chemicals in the body
are determined by the energies of those associations or disassociations.
So, A likes to be with T, G likes to be with C.
And in doing this, they have no choice.
And that is the fundamental reason
why it's incorrect to describe them as selfish,
either metaphorically or literally.
Only organisms with the freedom to choose
can be described as selfish or cooperative.
A baby, therefore, is not born selfish.
It simply has needs, food and care,
to enable it to live, to grow and to flourish.
And it slowly learns that it can choose.
And after about three or four years,
the parents get fed up, of course,
because by God, by then, it can choose.
And it knows what it wants.
But for those few years, it doesn't.
So, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.
Why is looking at the level of genes
not the best way to get to understanding a living system?
Well, I would say it's because focusing on the genome sequencing,
and that alone,
is like mistaking the pixels from the message.
This is the message at the end of the little book,
Understanding Living Systems.
And if I expand it up by a few tens of times,
you can see the pixels,
but at sufficient magnification,
it's no longer possible to see what the message is.
And this is my analogy for explaining why,
yes, genes are important.
We would not be able to make the proteins we make
that enable us to move
and do all the other things that organisms do.
That's not my point.
Of course, genes are important in enabling all that to be done.
But nothing right at the top of the organism
really depends on being able to read the A, T, C, and G.
Does your medical practitioner, your GP,
read your C, T's, A's, and G's
in order to decide what to do with you?
No, and never will.
So, I ask the question, you see,
how then did the genome become described as the book of life
creating us body and mind?
To repeat the mantra of my friend Richard.
I call him my friend because I've known him for 56 years.
We debate, as some of you know,
here in Hay-on-Why.
His books are absolutely brilliant,
extremely convincing until you understand
where they go wrong.
But now,
actually, we agreed on that two years ago.
Some of you will remember
we both told each other,
your books are brilliant,
but they're wrong.
Anyway,
now, amongst other things,
I am a computer programmer.
I learned to program valve computers 61 years ago
in order to work out the rhythm of the heart.
But if, as a computer programmer,
you look for where the if, this, then, that, else, the other,
where those clauses lie in the genome,
you will never find them.
Nobody has ever found
that kind of computer logic within the genome.
There are switches in genomes.
Each gene has an area near it, usually,
which is a switch.
But those switches are controlled
by other physiological processes.
They're not controlled by the genome itself.
Except indirectly,
because some of the rest,
which doesn't code for genes,
codes for what are called little RNAs,
that do, in fact,
have influence on what the genome is.
But that gives you,
gets you into
what I'm going to refer to at the end,
the physiological networks
that actually control what is happening.
So, where are the control mechanisms?
Now, this is a very complicated diagram.
I'm not going to take you through it.
But it shows you just how complex
a cell in your body really is.
All of those structures you see there
are actually lipid membranes,
like soap bubbles.
And it's essentially the fats in us
that are forming those membranes.
And it's the proteins in those membranes
that have the sensitivity
to the outside world,
the chemicals we encounter,
the electrical changes we encounter,
the mechanical changes we encounter,
absorption photons,
you name it,
they sense it.
And those are where the if-then-else clauses lie.
And, of course,
as I will show at the end,
they send messages down to the genome
to tell it what to do.
Incidentally, choice is an essential element
in any theory of how organisms
are able to make choices.
And it's important to know that
in addition to all of our cells,
nerve cells particularly
have these controllable on-off switches.
Now, there are no genes coding for membranes.
Yet, all of that is inherited.
At the debate two years ago,
Richard told me,
Dennis,
we could inscribe your genome in granite.
Keep it for 10,000 years,
and then in 10,000 years,
we could recreate Dennis Noble.
I said,
no, you can't.
Why not?
Oh, Richard,
where would you get my mother's egg cell
as it existed in 1936?
And that's the point.
You see,
all of that has to be inherited
in addition to the genome.
So,
now I'll just go through
the simple proofs
that were featured
in the Nature article in February
that the idea
that gene-centric biology
is the whole story,
the complete story.
It's an important story.
Remember what I said earlier on.
Genes are important.
They make proteins.
They enable those to be made.
But we've encountered,
unfortunately,
four major errors.
The first one is what is called
the central dogma
of molecular biology,
formulated by Crick in 1958.
It's the idea
that you simply go from DNA
to make an RNA
or RNAs in plural
and enable the organism
to make proteins.
That is absolutely correct.
If you keep the central dogma
as a simple chemical statement
of the sequence
described there,
absolutely correct.
And you cannot reverse that.
That's why it's called a dogma.
It is impossible to reverse it.
You can't go from proteins
to make DNA.
But that is not the way
in which organisms
control their genomes.
What was happening
during the pandemic
illustrates this perfectly well.
A new virus appeared.
Our immune systems detected it.
They then proceeded
to mutate
the relevant part
of the genome
and only that part
that codes
for the grabbing part
of the protein
they've got to make
called an immunoglobulin
that can grab
the virus
or the new bacteria
and whatever it is
and neutralize it.
How do they do that?
A message goes
to those cells
that can do that
to start proliferating
and through chance changes
to change
the genome sequence.
The system then
not the individual cell
can't know that
but the system
then decides
which cells
succeeded
in getting the one
that grabs the virus.
Those
are told to reproduce
as fast as possible
and then
the rest
are told to die.
So
the central dogma
does not
prevent
that kind of
process occurring.
It clearly occurs.
It occurred
during the pandemic
to all of us.
The second dogma
is one
that goes back
a very long way
indeed.
It was formulated
by the German geneticist
in the 19th century
August Weissmann
in 1883
just a year
incidentally
after Charles Darwin
passed away.
fortunate for him
because Charles Darwin
would have never
agreed with him.
His idea
was what we now
call the Weissmann barrier
which is that
not only
are the germline cells
that's the future
egg and sperm
kept separate
from the rest
of the body
but there's a barrier
between the two
so that
the body changes
can never be communicated
to the germline.
Incidentally
Darwin
totally disagreed
with Weissmann
about this.
Now
we've now found
that all
cells in the body
extrude
tiny packets
little vesicles
if you like
they're almost like
very tiny
cells
but they're not
really cells
they're just
vesicles
containing
some of the
control molecules
RNAs
proteins
and other
molecules
that control
the genome.
Many of those
bubble over
and pass
across the
so-called
barrier
and have
now been
shown
to affect
the metabolism
and other
major physiological
properties
of the germline
cells.
Incidentally
if you doubt
any of this
all the references
for that process
are in the transcript
of the debate
with Richard Dawkins
which you can find
online.
The third one
is one that I also
discussed with Richard Dawkins
two years ago
that DNA
self-replicates
like a crystal.
That idea
goes back
to 1942
and the lectures
given in the
Institute of Advanced
Studies
in Dublin
by the great
quantum mechanics
pioneer
Irving
Frödinger.
