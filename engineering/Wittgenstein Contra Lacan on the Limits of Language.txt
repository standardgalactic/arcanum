and i agree and it's funny that you brought that up that transition because one i think he's
definitely in dialogue with analytic philosophy very much regarding materialism um and and um
not like logical positivist and uh analytic philosophy but more like in the way that uh the
anglophone um side of things wants to like still rest on these sort of problems um sort of uh
outside of the history of the discourse so for instance mind-body dualism uh other minds uh the
the problem of materials and materialism and idealism from a sort of uh analytic uh sense
in which like again like you're just handling the arguments from a sort of logical rigor than like
seeing the concept develop not like in a hegelian sense although we could add that as well but just
in the fact of like how it emerged through the continental uh aspect but um i would i really
like that you brought up analytic uh philosophy because i actually watched your recent talk with
i think it's michael potter michael yeah and and and you know um you know we're obviously going to talk
about lacan and and yeah that book right i do really recommend it even if you're not interested in like
you know logic system and frega and russ but like just uh let's call it as a work of history of uh
analytic philosophy it was really it's really cool read yeah anyway sorry go ahead uh yeah yeah no no i
i agree i definitely want to check him out i really loved what he said though and um why i i i like the
analytic philosophy bit is because you know we come to think of lacan since our talk is going to be made
mainly about psychoanalysis and lacanian psychoanalysis lacan oriented within like the substratum of a
continental thought french theory poststructuralism postmodernism but when you actually read lacan's
seminars he's indebted of course to freud um but he is drawing from many thinkers of course hegel but
mainly the analytic tradition he's influenced by quine he's influenced by russell he's extremely
influenced and in dialogue with wittgenstein um and you'll see this throughout the entire seminars
including the later ones and then um of course in um one that's recently being published right now um
and it's in english from the cormac mcgallagher side um but it's a it's a text by him called little d
which is written in axiomatic form almost like a sort of spinosis geometry type thing which the basic
premise is regarding that of the axiom and discourse and fundamentally uh the root of the axiom is it
goes it does not go without saying right pretty much psychoanalysis uh does not go without saying
that is if we could be reductive the core tenet of the logic of psychoanalysis and pretty much combats
wittgenstein on the level of sensibility whereas uh he's dealing with sense senselessness and nonsense
and you know the late wittgenstein obviously is dealing with language games to the point where
philosophy is just another language game um and so what we can't know or talk about we must remain
silent whereas lakana would say no it does not go without saying and so for psychoanalysis the truth
of the unconscious may be half said you can't say it all but it does not go without saying and thus if
you if you read or if you watch the interview on television he says you know the infamous quote um
i speak the truth or at least i try to it's impossible to say the whole truth you can't say it all
what you might do is you can't say it all but it's impossible to take a great one and it does not go just
and that ties in with what he's getting at in his later years um you know as a not only as a
psychoanalyst but the question concerning um how do we teach this this this weird you know
discourse or system if you could call it that well if if i could put in very plain almost pedestrian
language here is is like one's point that you know what can shine has like the sense and nonsense
right so the nonsense we can't say anything but like on is saying that the the nonsense itself
can be said but not fully at the it can be said in its let's call it incompleteness is that kind of
what he's trying to get at yes but there is a qualification and i know you had much questions
or jumping you know into like full guns blazing yeah we'll just keep going this this ties in with
the theory of the registers the imaginary symbolic and real sense sensibility
from from a kantian sense right is you know it's it's of course does have a role to play in knowledge
but of course kant was you know involved with the conditions of possibility and it's funny i'm looking
at your poster behind you so um you know so like what he's aiming at you know is not on the level
of sense or sensibility now what i know wittgenstein probably doesn't mean it in the kantian sense i'm
drawing a sort of parallel but i think philosophy is in a sense uh aiming at you know knowledge and
understanding um from different areas but ultimately we seem sort of intuitive by this uh notion of
sense um in politics is always good sense or common sense um but we seem to fall short for lacan's sense
and this is a problem with a lot of clinicians that he's in uh polemics with is that the imaginary level
is formulated on concepts of understanding and sensibility um we're not even dealing with
nonsense because that is you know in a way a reified version of the imaginary we're getting at the real
and we're neither dealing with sense or nonsense but ab sense which is a neologism of absence and sense
so it's ab hyphen sense um and then he plays on with it with ab sex which because what psychoanalysis
uh is investigating is you know the infamous there is no such thing as a sexual relation and so we are
at the intercesses of um the impossibility of uh formalism and formalization right um and this is
where absence is you know the ability to formalize the impasse at the side of formalization right so
that is what the real gets at and going back to uh analytic philosophy what he liked about analytic
philosophy and especially like quine and all these other thinkers was like you know trying to uh grapple with
uh mathematics and logic and lacan wants to bring uh mathematics and logic back you know into a
relation because he believes that mathematics is able to account uh as a writing um you know
the sites of impasses but also to create new writings to account for those impossibilities um and so why
why does this matter right it's not just you know heavy jargon or lacanians being esoteric or obscure
what we're getting at is something that can't be formalized or uh or placed on a level of understanding
and it is freud's discovery um the unconscious unconscious yeah the unconscious is is not some
jungian type nor is it this sort of internal cauldron of instincts and all these fantasies
it's something that is in the gaps of speech and you know as the um infamous aphorism is the
unconscious is a structure like a language and it is like a language it is not a language um and that
it does involve writing because one the analyst is writing everything that the the patient is saying
but when you're formalizing these systems of signifiers you know we're getting at something
that is sort of impossible to understand on the level of sensibility on the level of common sense
and even on the level of sort of symbolic systems and networks of discourse it's something that
like mathematics is on the level of pure writing right and you only plug in you know the sort of
you know signification retroactive like active you know after the fact um but the main thing is like
you know one of the things that he likes about mathematics and logic and mathematical logic is he
also sees physics doing the same thing physics is sort of caught in its own imaginary misunderstanding
because it confuses nature with its model of nature for lacan nature is indifferent to what we're doing
we don't change nature with discourse we only change the discursive nature from our discursive
writing um and he's so obsessed with energetics and we could talk about that later but really what we
get at is like all these paradoxes um in in physics with these mathematical formalizations and when we
encounter that um we are also able to encounter the problem of you know our own system but mainly
with these mathematical formulas that physics relies on they again are misrecognizing the fact that this is
not nature itself this is uh discursive nature this is on the level of mathematical uh formalism and
formalization formalization is trying to create a language out of formal writing and that is where
the misrecognition is because while it is not a language in the sense like i'm writing english or
writing in japanese or whatever we have you know we have the impulse to talk about mathematics as if it
were a language but it is not right and in the same way you know this is what the real is um when we
encounter that sort of impossibility and so for lacan the transmission of knowledge or the transmission of
truth from this real impossibility is what you will call or like in the term the matem right and that is
these mathematical devices that he writes down that operate in that way they transmit something within
the psychoanalytic act someone like badu will take on this thing to transmit something on the level of
truth and the being of truth with his event theory
