is a pre-cultural given and coming with the body is this amazing thing which
everyone wants to give away throw away get away from called the felt moment of
immediate experience the felt moment of immediate experience this is you now
here in your body with the cheeseburger slowly dissolving the cup of coffee the
caffeine the bladder all of these things collisions
concrescences the crossing of trajectories of mental process digestive process
metabolism intent income emotional state the felt presence of immediate
experience lodged in the body mind system in the moment that's who you are
that's what they can't take away from you so there then one can begin to build
outward from that core and say aha so the stuff of understanding is not information
passed by culturally validated coding systems among the primates at high
chatter rate in other words the truth is not in the public space or the historical
space the space is the truth is in the felt space of the body in the moment
how's that cool okay it's a pleasure to be here it's a pleasure to see so many people
here once again this strange magical moment when we come together again or perhaps for the first
time you having come from wherever you came from me having come from the slopes of the
world's largest active volcano actually but via Manhattan and Austin last weekend and the
purpose of these things is sort of to check the state of the condensing collective
understanding about what is going on in the world or what might be going on in the world
this it seems to me is the subject worth talking about what is going on how can you find out what
what is going on how do you know when you found out what's going on can one know what is going on and my involvement with this is no different from your own a sincere desire to untangle these questions before the yawning grave closes over the enterprise and the entire thing becomes moot
one has you know a window of opportunity somewhere between zip and a hundred to solve or understand or penetrate or appreciate or come to terms with the conundrum of being
this amazing circumstance in which we find ourselves both individually and we find ourselves both individually and this that is the
and we find ourselves both individually and with the enterprise and the entire thing becomes moot
one has you know a window of opportunity somewhere between zip and the hundred to solve or understand or penetrate or appreciate or come to terms with the conundrum of being this amazing circumstance in which we find ourselves both individually and
and collectively collectively
we find ourselves you know somewhere between the slime and the archangels
making our way perilously over the millennia up the evolutionary ladder
toward the platonic light or something like that
at least this is the myth of intellectuals of the high-tech industrial democracies
evolved over the past hundred and fifty years
the triumphant ascent of organic life toward ever greater complexity
individually
we each find ourselves born into a culture we had no share in designing
but that we will be expected to inhabit inculcate and in fact pass on to our own progeny
and so this is our circumstance I think
individually and collectively
thrown into being Heidegger said
we didn't ask for it
here it is
what are we to make of it
and obviously if you toured the halls of this exhibition
we are to make much of it and money of it
these two principles seem to emerge
that there is much to be said
many ways to slice the pie
and the market economy is a very fertile domain in which to thrash this all out
you can sell your answers, you can trade your answers, you can upgrade your answers
you can subscribe, serialize, retrofit, export, import and reinvent answers
ultimately I wonder how satisfying all this is
and I am always amused at my own position in this situation
I'm
it's a great pain to the tolerance of the new age
that they keep inviting me back
I'm sort of like the crazy uncle
or you know
you hope for good behavior
but you understand that
it's a gamble
because I'm very ambiguous
about much of the methods and ways by which we do our intellectual business
and pursue the matter of community and salvation
the intellectual tension that seems to work its way through this society
almost like fat through meat
is the tension between scientific reductionism
and the deeply felt intuition of most people
that there is a spiritual dimension
or a hidden dimension
or a transcendental dimension
and of course downloaded into language
it becomes easily ridiculed
and downloaded into tasteless language
it should be ridiculed
but so when we try to formulate our spiritual intuitions
they are inevitably I think tainted by what we bring to it
and I was struck as I moved through the hall
it was almost like an exhibition of language types
as much as an exhibition of products or or possibilities
what were being sold were closed systems of jargon
all closed systems of thought are like this
and to my mind that the what seems to me very elderly age of 50
and I know to some people in the room it does seem very elderly
and to others I seem a pop
but anyway from this vantage point
it seems to me that all of these ideologies are cartoon like
they flatten
they simplify
they betray
they amuse
which is also cartoon like
and in amusing I think that this is where their health
fulfilling and solitary worth lies
they are intended to provoke a small smile
that smile will lift you a little further up the ladder
the rungs of the ladder of being
so I thought today what I would talk about
is some of the conclusions that I've come to
out of a life of psychedelic voyaging
living inside this insanely contradictory society
and going through the standard moves
marriage, divorce, children, career, controversy
allies, enemies, attorneys, counselors, consultants
consultants, accountants, so forth and so on
the same world you live in
what have I
well the first thing I concluded was to try and flee it
which I did a pretty good job of
by going to Hawaii
which believe me is a private Idaho
but the conclusions that I've reached are not politically correct
anywhere
and so I'm very happy to offend everyone
because that seemed to be what I did best
and there's no sign of mellowing at this point
so the conclusion that I reach
vis-a-vis the individual and civilization is this
culture is not our friend
culture is not your friend
it's not my friend
it's a very uncomfortable set of accommodations
institutions that have been hammered out over time
for the convenience of institutions
a young man gets his first dose of the news
that culture is not his friend
when told that he's going to be given an air ticket
and some training and sent to an exotic country
to kill its inhabitants
in the name of some political ideal
you have to be fairly dense
not to get the message at that point
that culture is not your friend
it is using you for its purposes
you would never dream of doing
what it now proposes
as the only conceivably right
and righteous course of action
well that's you know a black and white
a stark and enormous example
of what I'm talking about
but I think every day
in thousands of ways
we betray our impulses
toward wholeness
toward community
toward freedom
toward the spirit
by genuflecting
two cultural values
that are squirrely
or toxic
or simply wrong-headed
or obsolete
culture is not your friend
it's an illusion
what kind of an illusion
is it
and this sort of leads on to my
the other thing I've come to
it's a childish illusion
is the kind of illusion it is
recently I had a physical examination
with my doctor
and after it was all over
he leaned back in his chair
and he said
well you know most people
your age in the 19th century
were dead
yes
quite true
people live a great deal longer
in the 20th century
and consequently
consequently I think we
part of what drives alienation
is
it's like being
culture is like being taken
in a crap game
if you play long enough
you will figure out
that you're being screwed
and of course if you die
shortly into the game
it never enters your mind
we are all
some of you
may have seen
the little saying
that hangs behind bars
in Minnesota
we get too soon
old
and too late
smart
well
some of us are
getting smart
earlier
and earlier
and
what is seen
through to them
is the fact that
culture victimizes
ideology
victimizes
these things are all
con games
reality
culturally defined reality
is some kind of an
intelligence test
and those who are joining
are failing the test
this is very clear to me
looking at
well phenomena like
alien abduction
and
the great enthusiasm
for conspiracy theory
that now seems to attend
so much modern thinking
again
these are
epistemological cartoons
where
low production values
made acceptable
through tolerance
of TV
is
allowing people
to accept
material
into their own
story
which should actually
end up
on the cutting room
floor
everything
nothing
is
what it appears
to be
surely you've noticed
that
that's
that's a
right
a is
nothing is what it
appears to be
well therefore
complex
difficult
tricky
and mercurial
things
are even less
likely to be
what they claim
to be
than other forms
of reality
so
confronted
with
the endless
whispered
rumors
and doctored
photographs
and breathless
testimony
from the denizens
of trailer
courts
and so forth
and so on
what is one
to make
of all that
well
I think
what you're
it's
the message
is
return to
basics
the information
matrix
has become
compromised
the data
stream
is now
suspect
return to
first principles
what are
first principles
that
that's what
the 20th
entry is
trying to
figure out
yes
what are
first principles
I'd like
to suggest
to you
that a place
to begin
is the
body
you have
one
it isn't
ideologically
defined
it can
be
ideologically
defined
you know
in catholic
school
the nuns
used to
tell us
we should
dress
in darkness
so we
wouldn't
be an
occasion
of sin
to ourselves
that's an
example
of the
body
becoming
ideologically
defined
but
it
precedes
culture
culture
has to
deal
with the
fact
that your
eyes are
on the
front of
your face
and your
anal
pore
is located
near your
genitals
culture
would probably
rather have
it some
other way
it would
be so
convenient
but hey
it's a
given
I'm so
happy
we don't
our rumps
don't swell
in estrus
the way
some of
the other
primates
do
can you
imagine
giorgio
armani
trying to
create a
line of
fashion
that comes
to term
with that
but I
but I
digress
so the
body
the body
is a
pre-cultural
given
and coming
with the
body
is this
amazing
thing
which everyone
wants to
give away
throw away
get away
from
called
the felt
moment of
immediate
experience
the felt
moment of
immediate
experience
this is
you
now
here
in your
body
with the
cheeseburger
slowly
dissolving
the cup
of coffee
the caffeine
the bladder
all of
these
things
collisions
concrescences
the crossing
of trajectories
of mental
process
digestive
process
metabolism
intent
income
emotional
state
the felt
presence
of immediate
experience
lodged in
the body
mind
system
in the
moment
that's
who you
are
that's
what they
can't take
away
from you
whether they
drag you
away to
prison
beat you
drug you
whatever
they do
to you
you will
still
have
some
kind
of
felt
presence
of
experience
until
you
drift
into
the
darkness
of
non
entity
so
there
then
one
can
begin
to build
outward
from
that
core
and say
aha
so the
stuff
of
understanding
is not
information
passed
by culturally
validated
coding
systems
among
the primates
at high
chatter
rate
in other
words
the truth
is not
in the
public
space
or the
historical
space
the
space
is
the truth
is in
the felt
space
of the
body
in the
moment
well
so some
great
religions
have gotten
this far
and they
whatever they
are and there
are many of
them
come at
last to
advocate
something
called
meditation
which has
many guises
and travels
under many
names
and methods
but what it
primarily is
is
attention
to
attention
and what it
primarily
reveals
in
in the
ordinary
metabolism
is
frankly
bloody
little
good
meditators
will tell you
how incredibly
boring it
is
and the
rhetoric
of the
religions
that have
made
meditation
the
centerpiece
of their
ontology
is a
rhetoric
of
nihilism
I mean
this is
you know
I should
have said
nihilism
because this
is sort
of the
dirty
little
secret
of
Buddhist
ontology
it isn't
the cheerful
new
Buddhism
being exported
from
California
it's the
old style
Nagarjunian
Buddhism
that says
you know
it is an
emptiness
within
an
emptiness
after
an
emptiness
before
an
emptiness
this is
Nagarjuna
on the
nature
of
Bodhi
mind
but
interestingly
meditation
pursued
not for
years
or
lifetimes
but
perceived
as a
cultural
project
over
centuries
leads
not to
a
clarifying
of this
philosophical
emptiness
but to
a
discovery
that
the
depths
of
nihilism
the depths
of
non-entity
are
in fact
that's
motif
in their
aspects
not a
plenum
not a
plenum
not an
undivided
platonic
thing
but an
environment
of
spirit
meaning
power
intentionality
entities
intelligences
levels
swarming
swarming
swarming
in the
imagination
and
these
things
can
be
accessed
through
drugs
through
extraordinary
physical
practices
or
ordeals
through
various
kinds
of
driving
of
physiological
systems
like
sonic
driving
through
drumming
or
physiological
driving
through
repeated
chanting
and
then
the
ordinary
boundaries
of
culture
and
of
body
dissolve
into
a much
larger
realm
the
imagination
and
it is
this
imagination
that I
think
is the
place to
put our
attention
the
imagination
is
a
dimension
of
non-local
information
quantum
physics
is now
moving
towards
securing
the
idea
that
in
some
kind
of a
mathematical
super
space
all
particles
in
the
universe
maintain
a
kind
of
super
state
of
connectivity
called
Bell's
non-local
connectivity
what this
means to
me
is
that
the
imagination
is
literally
another
dimension
a
dimension
that
is
non-local
now the
mind
the
animal
mind
the
human
mind
the
paleolithic
mind
evolved
as a
master
coordinator
of
sensory
data
coming
into the
body
from the
senses
about
the
level
of
threat
and
danger
in
immediate
three-dimensional
space
that's
the
mind's
evolutionary
function
to preserve
the body
to preserve
the genetic
stream
of unfolding
by detecting
and avoiding
threat
and so our minds
have evolved
in the same
way that
water
takes the
shape
of its
container
our minds
have evolved
to take
the shape
of three-dimensional
space
and time
under
cultural
and
environmental
pressure
well
we've paid
a huge
price
for this
it probably
also has
ensured
that we're
here this
afternoon
to discuss
it
but it's
been a
long
time
since the
instantaneous
reflex
to bash
the brains
out of
anything
moving
near you
that's
unfamiliar
has
served
us
well
you know
I mean
that got
old
12,000
years ago
the entire
enterprise
of civilization
has been
about
something
else
the felt
presence
nearby
ineffable
unsayable
but
uncannily
penetrating
of
beauty
of
mathematical
connectivity
of
supernatural
power
and so
these are
the things
the exploration
of which
the singing
about
of which
make us
human beings
the exploration
of the universe
of the unseen
is the business
of human beings
it's why we are
the way we are
it's why we will be
the way we will be
it's how we got
where we are
how is it done
it's done
by dissolving
ordinary
cultural
boundaries
by
perturbing
consciousness
and by
paying
careful
attention
to the
results
and attempting
to build
models
there from
now
in the last
few thousand
years
in the west
this enterprise
has been
tamed
by
priestcraft
which
combines
the enterprise
with judicious
politicking
and a certain
amount of
ass licking
before that
the enterprise
was untainted
by such
secular
concerns
it was
full
force
forward
into the
unknown
and this is
the great
era
of shamanism
and what
is
shamanism
but
philosophy
with a
hands-on
attitude
philosophy
not made
around the
campfire
but philosophy
based on
the acquisition
of extreme
experience
that's
how you
figure out
what the
world is
not by
bicycling
around in
the burbs
but by
forcing
extreme
experience
the reason
people
refer to
psychedelic
endeavors
with the
vocabulary
of travel
taking a
trip
and so
on
is because
that is
an extreme
endeavor
it's the
same
endeavor
it's the
leaving behind
of the
values
of your
own
culture
you know
take
nothing
but a
change
of
clothes
fly to
Benares
and take
and take
up residence
and take
up residence
among the
charis
sadhus
and I
guarantee
you
whether you
resort to
psychedelics
or not
you will
experience
boundary
dissolution
a reorienting
of categories
and a
reframing
of your
perspective
on your
life
and your
being
so
extreme
experience
is the
necessary
key
this is
true in
all forms
of endeavor
I mean
if you
if you want
to understand
the atom
you have to
smash it
you know
sitting around
looking at it
it will
never yield
its secrets
you have to
smash that
sucker to bits
and then
collect the
pieces
and then
examine
exactly how
it all
came apart
in the same
way
and without
you know
going too
far afield
for the pun
we must
smash
ordinary
consciousness
get smashed
and then
look at the
pieces flying
in all
directions
and say
you know
gee I didn't
know minds
could do
that
well
they can't
in the
workaday
rote
of you
know
living inside
the little
boxes
of positivism
and constipated
behaviorism
and all
the rest
of it
so
extreme
experiences
but
you know
you don't
want these
experiences
to be too
extreme
or you
will sever
the connectivity
among the
various
subsystems
and then
we'll have
to bury
you
and
this is
always
a huge
strain
on those
left
behind
so
there is
a practical
element
here
which is
okay so
we want to
have extreme
experiences
but we don't
want to have
such extreme
experiences
that we don't
live to tell
the tale
we want
control
to some degree
over these
experiences
well this is
where the
incredible
thoroughness
of our human
ancestors
comes to
our aid
throughout
time and
space
on this
planet
our remote
the tribal
societies
that preceded
us
made it
their business
to discover
catalog
and learn
to manipulate
plants
in the
environment
as the
carriers
as the
sources
of chemical
compounds
in the
environment
which would
work
extraordinary
transformations
on consciousness
without
physical
harm
without
physiological
damage
to the
organism
and of
all the
many
techniques
ordeal
abandonment
in the
wilderness
sexual
abstinence
hanging
by your
pectoral
muscles
from hooks
in the
sun
for days
all of
these
sorts of
things
of all
of these
methods
psychedelic
plants
and their
judicious
use
is
arguably
the most
effective
the
now get
that
the most
effective
and the
least
invasive
and the
most
likely
to
produce
negative
long-term
consequences
well this
was not
news
or even
controversy
anywhere in
the world
until
within the
confines of
the 20th
century
basically
the presence
of these
substances
and plants
began to
alarm
the order
keeping
forces
of the
high-tech
industrial
democracy
issue
separate
from the
issue
of
stimulants
and
depressants
it's an
issue
separate
from the
issue
of
addiction
and
dependency
these
things
are not
stimulants
or depressants
and they
do not
cause
addiction
or
dependency
what
they
cause
is
what
I'm
advocating
a fundamental
revaluation
of cultural
values
because culture
as we're
practicing it
currently
is
causing a lot
pain
to a lot
of people
and animals
and ecosystems
none of whom
were ever allowed
to vote
on whether they
wanted this
process
to go
in this
direction
we do not
feel
what we
are doing
remember I
spoke about
the primacy
of the
felt
moment
of experience
if we
could feel
what we
are doing
we would
stop
doing it
but
between
us
and the
consequences
of our
action
there are
endless
veils
of
political
rhetoric
stultification
denial
sedation
intoxication
ideological
delusion
delusion
now
normally
I think
a rap
like this
tends to
if you have
to pigeonhole
it
to come
down
on the
side
of
pessimism
but
I am
I am
not
pessimistic
I see
everything
as though
it were
integrated
and connected
and there
is an
unfolding
and a
plottedness
about
our
situation
it's not
for nothing
that at
the very
pinnacle
of the
age of
faith
in the
machine
and science
and male
dominance
and projection
of strategic
weaponry
and so forth
and so on
that there
should come
from the
gentler
societies
of the
world
from the
rainforests
and high
deserts
of the
world
the news
of these
plants
you know
the western
mind
the cataloging
mind
the cartesian
mind
in its
frenzy
to locate
list
isolate
and define
everything
carried these
plants and
substances
over the past
150 years
into
the confines
of our
society
and they are
much like
trojan horses
left there
by the
bedraggled
beat down
disenfranchised
third world
shamanic
people
to be found
by the
white coated
priests
and priestesses
of science
and to be
brought back
into the
laboratory
to be
picked apart
for their
efficacy
in treating
addiction
or overcoming
neurotic
behavior
or something
like that
but of course
the neurotic
behavior
that they
impact
upon
is
neurotic
behavior
so wide
so deep
so revered
that it is
in fact
cultural values
themselves
you see
what is
happening
I think
is
it's
it's really
bigger
than psychedelics
it's bigger
than human
evolution
we are not
making
the waves
in this ocean
we are
our corks
riding
the waves
of the ocean
but we are
privileged
by
perhaps
chance
alone
to occupy
a unique
moment
in the history
of the universe
a moment
when the universe
goes through
some kind
of self
transforming
evolutionary
inflationary
expansion
that's what's
happening
I mean
it's been
happening
for a long
time
it depends
on where
you pull
back to
to get
your
perspective
one could
say
looking at
the universe
in general
that this planet
has been
favored
from the very
beginning
that by a
billion years
ago
the discerning
could tell
that this
was a planet
going places
but certainly
by 500 million
years ago
it was clear
that this
was a planet
going places
one complex
animal life
form
gave way
to another
catastrophes
yes
but never
catastrophes
so total
that the
enterprise
was wiped
out
we know
that 65
million years
ago
a catastrophe
an asteroid
a planetesimal
impact
occurred
on this
planet
nothing
larger
than a
chicken
walked
away
from that
on this
planet
a bad
day
you say
but were
it not
for that
bad
day
we would
still be
the egg
eating
shrews
at the
edge
of the
reptilian
garden
party
these
marvelous
flowering
plants
chock full
of psychedelic
alkaloids
none of
them
would have
existed
the flowering
plants
and the
higher
mammals
all arose
in the
wake
of this
planet
scouring
catastrophe
so you
see
there is
built in
to the
larger
systems
of nature
an enormous
what my
mentor
Eric
Yance
used to
call
metastability
they are
metastable
they are
not easily
deflected
an event
as large
as a
planetesimal
impact
basically
only resets
the evolutionary
clock
by a few
million years
and then
in almost
overleaping
itself
to make
up for
lost
time
out of
all of
that
catastrophe
come
primates
animals
of such
complexity
and coordinated
sensoria
that they
are
wonders
to behold
and from
them
and quickly
then come
abilities
never before
seen
in the world
of organic
organization
freely
commandable
languages
spoken
languages
symbolic
activity
for the
first time
well at
that point
you know
even the
academics
believe
human
language
is less
than
40,000
years old
that means
it's as
artificial
as the
dirigible
or the
hypodermic
needle
it's an
invention
of some
sort
within the
confines
of human
history
or at
the beginning
of human
history
recall
in South
Africa
we have
fire pits
and stone
tools
2 million
years old
those are not
homo sapien
tools
but they're
the tools
of homo
habilis
the preceding
ancestor
in the
human
line
my point
is
we are
caught up
in a
process
of
unfolding
complexification
that has
now lodged
in our
species
we are
its source
at this
point
at one
point
its source
was the
geology
of the
planet
at a
later
point
closer
to us
in time
its source
was all
biological
diversity
but as
the novelty
has increased
the domain
of its
expression
has narrowed
and it is
now confined
largely
to the
human
species
oh yes
the rest
of nature
continues
the slow
unfolding
of continental
drift
and gene
mutation
and transfer
and so forth
but these
things have
now receded
into the
background
as the
human
adventure
takes
center stage
so it's
almost as
though
in fact
this is
what I
believe
that we
are not
pushed
from behind
by the
causal
unfolding
of historical
necessity
but that
we are
in the
grip of
an
attractor
of some
sort
which lies
ahead of
us
in time
and so
we are not
as it were
following what
the statisticians
call a
random walk
across the
temporal
landscape
in fact
the temporal
landscape is
a canyon
with incredibly
steep walls
and we are
only free
to move
within very
narrow confines
as the
grip
almost the
morphogenetic
intensity
of the
attractor
at the
end of
time
increases
its
penetration
and its
hold
over our
imaginations
our
city plans
our
technologies
our religious
ontologies
our medical
strategies
so forth
and so on
something is
revealing itself
to us
through us
and as we
get closer
the chatter
of noise
and static
being given
off of this
thing
increases
exponentially
because
you know
McLuhan
said once
he said
we move
into the
future
like a
person
driving
who uses
only the
rear view
mirror
that's how
we understand
the future
by driving
in the
rear view
mirror
all of
our
models
of what
lies ahead
are based
on
inverted
models
of the
past
and the
one thing
you can
be certain
of is
that
won't
do it
because we
can see
a person
standing in
1900
using that
method
would have
been wrong
about the
late
1990s
a person
standing
in 1600
using that
method
would have
been wrong
about the
late
1900s
and so
forth and so
on
you cannot
extrapolate
from the
future
into the
past
into the
future
because the
real nature
of the
future
is its
thing
in itself
and that's
what it's
trying to
reveal
and so
the
whisperings
that reach
the ears
of the
channelers
the
visions
that come
through
the hands
of painters
sculptors
choreographers
musicians
all of
the felt
presence
of the
invisible
world
is now
incredibly
pregnant
with this
message
of
transformation
and the
challenge
for each
of us
is to
streamline
our
language
sufficiently
that we
may mirror
this thing
in a way
that is both
true to it
and rationally
apprehendable
to ourselves
and this is a
fractal
boundary
this is a
test
of
intelligence
because
the thing
in itself
cannot be
rationally
beheld
you know
the
enzymologist
JBS
Haldane
once said
he said
the world
is not only
stranger
than we
suppose
it's
stranger
than we
can
suppose
that to
me is a
dizzying
thought
and
obviously
true
so
what we
want is a
model
true to
the stranger
than we
can
suppose
but not
so alien
that there
is no
emotional
or spiritual
support in
it
for the
enterprise
of being
human
how do
we do
that
how do
we
inculcate
the
unspeakable
mystery
of the
transcendental
object
at the
end of
time
with
the
mundane
nexus
of real
occasions
that happens
to be
our own
existence
well
to my
mind
the answer
is
it lies
in the
ability
to
assimilate
paradox
and that
means
you have
to
transcend
the idea
of a
closed
logical
system
you have
to live
with the
idea
that there
is no
intellectual
closure
this is
in fact
the door
marked
freedom
but you've
been taught
that it's
the door
marked
madness
to live
to live
in the
light
of
paradox
things
cannot
be
we are
taught
both
a
and
b
simultaneously
this is
aristotelian
logic
a
is a
this is
as old
as thought
in the
west
but it
has to
be
overcome
and in
the
felt
presence
of
the
moment
of
immediate
experience
it is
overcome
the
mystery
does not
lie
far
it lies
in the
immediate
moment
in the
act
the fact
of
being
the only
time we
really
confront
this
is
in the
psychedelic
experience
or
other
moments
of
extreme
epiphany
the
model
that I
have
come
to
wrap
around
all of
this
because I
think it's
simple
and
straightforward
and it
leaves
plenty
of
room
for
people
to
add
their
own
filigree
is a
dimensional
model
god forbid
a mathematical
model
but it
works
something
like
this
I
mentioned
earlier
that
our
senses
have
evolved
as a
threat
detection
device
and
have
sort
of
crunched
us
down
into
three
dimensional
space
the
shaman
wherever
and
whenever
he or
she
does
their
shamanizing
the
shaman
is a
person
who is
able to
transcend
the
dimensional
confines
of cultural
existence
they
are
they
know
more
than
the
people
they
serve
the
people
they
serve
are
like
children
within
the
game
of
culture
only
the
shaman
knows
that
culture
is a
game
everyone
else
takes
it
seriously
that's
how
he
can
do
his
magic
I
was
recently
in
Australia
and
of
course
aboriginal
culture
and
shamanism
is a
topic
of
great
interest
down
there
and
I
learned
maybe
some
of
you
already
knew
this
that
the
term
for
shaman
among
english
speaking
aboriginals
of whom
there are
many
some
who have
spoken
it
for
several
hundred
years
or
over
a hundred
years
anyway
the
term
for
shaman
is
simply
clever
fella
and
if
someone
says
I
am
a
clever
fella
they
are
making
a
professional
claim
of
great
weight
but
I
love
that
because
it's
it says
it all
you know
a clever
fella
when I
was in
the amazon
in my
exploring
days
we would
go up
these rivers
to these
bare ass
folks
and to
spend time
with them
and the
people would
want to
you know
touch
the outboard
motors
and look at
your camera
equipment
and the
butterfly
nets
and gather
around
open face
totally
innocent
you could
always tell
the shaman
because
first of
all
he
usually
didn't
come
out
to
see
who
was
there
even
though
no
one
ever
came
even
though
these
people
had
visitors
once
every
six
months
the
guy
who
wouldn't
come
out
of
his
hut
for the
only
event
in
six
months
was
inevitably
the
shaman
and when
you
met
him
he
wasn't
interested
in
your
velcro
or
your
break
apart
glow
in the
dark
little
trinkets
or any
of the
rest
of
it
is
looking
straight
at
you
through
the
eyes
outside
the
culture
saying
what
kind
of
a
person
are
you
are
you
a
fool
or
are
you
a
clever
fellow
what
is
your
measure
how
much
of
the
situation
do
you
understand
how
many
levels
are
you
simultaneously
aware
of
at
this
moment
and
you
know
looking
into
the
eyes
of
that
sort
of
person
you
either
grow
or
turn
away
you
have
not
much
choice
so
what's
happening
with
the
shaman
I
think
is
he's
a
hands-on
mathematician
a
hands-on
non-euclidean
geometer
the
shaman
enters
into
the
chaos
of the
psychedelic
experience
and
sees
that
it
is
not
chaos
it
is
hyperspace
and
in
it
the
adumbrations
of the
trees
of
possibility
can
be
followed
one
can
see
who
stole
the
eggs
one
can
see
who
cuckled
the
chief's
nephew
one
can
see
who
will
die
and
who
will
live
one
can
see
how
the
weather
is
going
to
change
and
one
can
know
where
the
game
went
and
this
is
not
magic
not
in
that
world
it's
impossible
in
three
dimensional
space
and
time
but
in
fourth
dimensional
space
and
time
it
not
only
is
possible
it's
inevitable
and
unavoidable
it's
a
different
kind
of
way
of
being
with
the
information
and
you know
I'm sure
many of you
have your
own
psychedelic
epiphanies
that
are
as
gripping
and
as
fascinating
as
anything
that
has
happened
to
me
epiphanies
that
show
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
ordinary
boundaries
of
information
space
time
limitation
are
dissolved
and
it
may
happen
only
for
a
moment
it
may
involve
a
curing
with
a
laying
on
of
hands
it
may
involve
a
sudden
insight
into
a
set
of
complex
relationships
it
may
involve
a
sudden
unexpected
certitude
about
how
a
certain
event
went
down
that
when
checked
upon
turns out
to be
true
what
we
know
about
the
world
is
defined
by
our
culture
and
the
way
culture
does
this
is
through
language
you
can't
know
or
perceive
or
appreciate
what
cannot
be
brought
in
to
the
domain
of
language
you
can't
publicly
know
or
appreciate
these
things
you
can
feel
them
as
the
rich
contextual
embeddedness
of your
own
being
but
you
can't
communicate
them
sometimes
when I
read
Marcel
Proust
I
come
upon
passages
where
the
conveyance
of the
information
of the
emotion
is so
exquisitely
subtle
that I
have the
feeling
I know
what he
means
I
felt
this
but I
never
dreamed
I would
ever see
it in
print
or have
a thought
about it
that I
could share
with anyone
else
because it
is so
subtle
so
the
challenge
to all
of us
I
think
is
not
this
one
dimensional
chasing
after
of
answers
this
is a
fool's
game
but
an
actual
stepping
back
to
gain
perspective
and to
realize
salvation
is always
available
it's in
the
moment
it's an
act
of
understanding
it doesn't
come down
through a
lineage
it doesn't
come
through
a
substance
an
empowerment
a word
it comes
through
understanding
salvation
is an
act
of
rational
apprehension
of some
sort
and
you know
I
really
believe
that
we are
now
in a
relationship
to the
transcendental
object
at the
end of
time
such
that
the
revelations
are
daily
the
unfoldment
the
connectivity
we can
see
light
at the
end
of
the
tunnel
I
mean
I've
had
long
practice
I've
been
thinking
like
this
since
1968
talking
about
it
like
this
since
1980
but
I
never
knew
what
how
it
would
come
or
what
it
would
be
in
the
last
few
years
with
the
rise
of
a
technological
a
cultural
artifact
like
the
internet
I
now
see
how
it
will
make
its
way
into
the
world
we
are
building
the
nervous
system
of the
human
oversoul
we
are
individual
units
operating
under
social
rules
that
are
pushing
us
ever
closer
toward
dissolving
our
societies
societies
human
groups
run
by
rules
into
telepathic
collectivities
of some
sort
and the
chaos
of the
internet
is
chaos
only
to the
constipated
order
freaks
of the
Habesian
sociological
machine
it
makes
them
uncomfortable
because
they
can't
find
the
head
they
can't
find
the
hierarchy
but
it's
head
and
hierarchy
that
have
distorted
and
made
human
institutions
so
abrasive
and
uncomfortable
for the
people
who
inhabit
them
so
I
really
believe
there
is no
contradiction
between
technology
and
spirit
there
is no
contradiction
between
the
search
for
intellectual
integration
and
understanding
and the
psychedelic
experience
there
is no
contradiction
between
ultra
advanced
hyperspatial
cyber
culture
and
paleolithic
archaic
culture
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
our
sojourn
in
matter
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
our
separateness
this
is all
very
scary
none
of
us
know
what
it
means
but
the
forces
that
have
been
called
into
being
are
now
beyond
the
control
of
any
institution
or
any
strategic
planning
committee
or
any
banking
committee
these
things
have
a
life
of
their
own
there
is
a
morphological
unfoldment
occurring
on this
planet
it
is
bringing
forth
some
entirely
new
order
of
being
we
are
a
privileged
part
of
this
individually
our
hope
is
to
understand
and
participate
in
the
epiphany
it
is
there
is
no
blame
nothing
is
off
kilter
or
wrong
or
unnatural
or
artificial
no
principle
has been
betrayed
this is
how
it is
supposed
to be
but as
it
picks up
speed
it's
going to
become
more
and more
frightening
as
most
metaphors
fail
and this
is why
the rise
of cults
and why
the grasping
at ontological
straws
and why
the whisperings
from various
corners of the
universe
have grown
to a roar
because
we are
uncertain
we are
not
sure
but
I think
you become
sure
by connecting
to the
source
and then
what you
become
for other
people
is
a source
of reassurance
there
isn't
the perfect
metaphor
for understanding
this
situation
is a
birth
if you
had never
seen a
birth
and you
were rushing
about your
daily
business
and suddenly
came around
a corner
and this
was happening
as for
example
could happen
to you
in India
or in
Africa
somewhere
and here
you confronted
human birth
if you
had not
been
prepared
for that
moment
you
would
have
a
real
emotional
thing
on your
hands
it
looks
like
a
medical
emergency
blood
is being
shed
organs
are being
stretched
there is
pleading
and groaning
and moaning
you have to
have your
chops
very together
to look
at this
situation
and say
how wonderful
new life
coming into
the world
as it has
always
coming
to the
world
now
a birth
can be
simple
and easy
or it
can be
prolonged
and tormented
it can be
an occasion
for joy
or it
can end
in
catastrophe
the key
is
preparation
understanding
awareness
and
a
desire
to meet
the experience
in all
of its
fullness
the birth
is coming
the birth
is coming
and what
it does
to the
social systems
we've put
in place
the groaning
ecologies
that are taking
the weight
of our
billions
what it does
to the
atmosphere
what it does
to the
economies
upon which
you and I
depend
this all
depends
on how
educated
and enlightened
each one
of us
can make
ourselves
as the
thing
moves
toward
completion
and it's
no time
for foolishness
and it's
no time
for rumor
mongering
and it's
no time
for throwing
away your
epistemological
razors
and indulging
in the
spreading
of
unlikelihoods
it's
time to
actually
pull
together
the
plants
are the
pipeline
into the
Gaian
intention
it's just
not a
coincidence
that these
plants
carry this
immense
spiritual
message
they are
the pipeline
of Gaian
intentionality
we were
not out
of balance
for millions
of years
or hundreds
of thousands
of years
of intellectual
existence
in which we
had humor
and song
and ribaldry
and poetry
and horsing
around
and art
and theater
we were
not out
of balance
because
our religion
involved the
dissolving of
our cultural
values once
a week
or once
a month
back in
to the
primary
to the
mysterious
mama
matrix
of
primordial
being
once we
cut that
off
once we
began to
make it
up
or to
listen to
the most
shrill
among us
make it
up
we were
lost
that's
what we're
returning
to
our story
is the
story of
the prodigal
son
we left
the family
farm
the balance
the domesticity
and we made
a shaman's
journey
deep into
the heart
of matter
and of
energy
of space
and time
we return
with gifts
with
understandings
no shaman
before ever
had
quantum physics
fractal mathematics
astrophysics
cosmology
the knowledge
of DNA
this is real
knowledge
and we
shed real
blood
to obtain it
now
it can be
given meaning
by being
brought
under the
umbrella
of authentic
archaic
human
values
informed
by
relationships
with
psychedelic
plants
this is
the
comfortable
future
the hopeful
future
that lies
ahead
to the
degree that
people turn
their back
on this
they're going
to have
a rough
time
explaining to
themselves
and their
children
just what
exactly
is happening
at the end
of the
20th century
okay
that's my
rant
now I
want to
hear from
you
thank you
I mean
I really
think
and let's
say a couple
of things
these things
are much
more fruitful
in the
question and
answer period
at least
for me
and then
the other
thing I
want to
say is
about the
psychedelic
community
of Chicago
you know
it's all
fine and
good to
come to
hear the
great ones
pontificate
but the
reality of
the situation
is this
is your
community
and we
have self
selected
ourselves
to be
here
out of
the
millions
who aren't
and the
thousands
who came
to this
conference
and who
are also
not
here
so
look
around
somebody
in this
room
has
what
you're
looking
for
and
it
probably
isn't
me
we
used
to
stand
out
but
then
our
sartorial
choices
triumphed
everywhere
and now
we look
like
everybody
else
but
I'd
like
to
do
questions
now
for
the
rest
of
the
session
yeah
yeah
I
stay
away
I
stay
away
from
talking
about
my
own
mathematical
theories
because
the word
mathematics
is
guaranteed
to
clear
a
hall
in
most
situations
but
I
think
it's
I
it's
perfectly
well
just
to
do
this
very
briefly
two
things
are
completely
obvious
to me
that
science
has
missed
and
you're
smart
people
check
it
out
isn't
this
true
that
the
universe
has
gotten
more
complicated
as we
approach
the
present
that
everything
they
ever
told
you
on
discovery
channel
or
anywhere
else
supports
the
idea
that
the
universe
in
the
beginning
was
simple
and
then
it
got
more
complicated
right
so
that's
a
truth
that
reaches
notice
across
biology
geology
astrophysics
it's
a cross
disciplinary
truth
of great
power
well
then
here's
a second
truth
related
to the
first
this
movement
into
complexity
from the
remote
past
to the
present
is
occurring
faster
and
faster
and
faster
and
that's
where
we
come
into
the
picture
you
see
we
are
animals
but
we
are
animals
plus
language
plus
technology
plus
religion
plus
analytical
analysis
so forth
and so
on
we
represent
some
kind
of
an
experiment
in a
deepening
of
complexity
and
historical
change
occurs
at
orders
of
magnitude
faster
than
biological
change
and
very
recently
pick a
number
100
years
ago
50
years
ago
something
like
that
it
seems
like
we
entered
into
an
even
deeper
involution
of the
spiral
well you
don't
have to
be
a rocket
scientist
to figure
out
that
the
spiral
closure
that's
moving
faster
and
faster
is
now
moving
so
fast
that
its
culmination
can be
imagined
to occur
within a
human
lifetime
and
I
think
that
that's
true
I
think
we
are
the
last
generation
of
proto
human
beings
and
that
beyond
us
lies
something
very hard
to imagine
the
human
machine
symbiote
something
which
is
going
to
spring
not
from
my
loins
but
as
Zeus
daughter
sprang
in a
sense
from
his
forehead
and
it's
not
simply
a
new
species
it's
a
new
order
of
being
it's
as
dramatic
a
break
with
the
earlier
orders
of
natural
organization
as
the
eukaryotes
were
from
the
prokaryotes
and
the
land
animals
were
from
the
sea
how
does
that
make
us
feel
well
I
don't
know
how
does
it
make
you
feel
it's
a
complicated
feeling
here
you know
in
Silicon
Valley
there
are
people
every
day
who
go
to
work
with
the
phrase
in
their
mind
the
great
work
and
what
is
the
great
work
the
great
work
is
the
handing
on
of
human
civilization
to
a
species
intelligent
enough
to
appreciate
the
enterprise
and
you
know
it
will
be
a
symbiote
we
hope
it
will
be
an
AI
for
sure
it's
here
it's
here
I
mean
it
depends
on
how
much
you
understand
and
who
you
know
and
which
technologies
you
follow
we're
all
coming
to
terms
with
it
at
different
levels
but
in
a
sense
the
only
thing
left
is
the
collective
realization
occurring
individual
by
individual
that
in
fact
history
has
ended
this
is
you
know
not
only
the
post
modern
dispensation
it's
the
post
historical
dispensation
what
happens
next
well
that
that's
the
adventure
we
prayed
for
and
claimed
we
wanted
so
it
is
upon
us
yeah
in
the
back
oh
thanks
for
bringing
that
all
up
heaven's
gate
well
you know
we only
have an
hour and
a half
here
and I
have a
lot
of
ideas
about
all
of
this
I
think
you know
that was
a perfect
example
ideology
kills
it is
not
a
childish
game
ideology
kills
and I
was very
amused
I mean
the
heaven's
gate
thing
was a
tragedy
but there
were
curious
aspects
to it
I mean
it was
the week
before
Easter
all
around
me
I
heard
people
saying
things
like
you know
how
could
people
believe
such
crazy
stuff
and
by the
way
honey
did
you
get
a
dress
for
service
so we
can
go and
celebrate
the
resurrection
of the
Redeemer
and you
just
wonder
you know
whose
ox
is getting
gored
here
because
something
is
absolutely
nuts
but
400
million
people
believe
it
that
makes
it
okay
but
if
20
people
believe
something
that's
that's
a
cult
I
have
an
all
of
this
gives
me
the
creeps
I
have
an
absolute
horror
of
belief
systems
and
cults
and
I've
never
met
a
guru
I
really
liked
I've
never
met
one
I've
trusted
you know
Alice
Roosevelt
Longworth
Teddy
Roosevelt
some
relative
I don't
know
anyway
she
used
to
say
at
these
White
House
dinners
that
they
would
give
in
the
Roosevelt
administration
she
said
if
you
have
nothing
good
to
say
about
anyone
sit
by
me
and
I'm
sort of
in that
position
being on
the
celeb
circuit
and so
forth
I
have
I
have a
chance
to
be
behind
the
scenes
and
since
I
wasn't
appointed
or
nobody
ever
came
to
me
or
I
feel
free
to
report
to
you
because
I
identify
with
you
I
don't
identify
with
them
I
identify
with
you
and
I'm
telling
you
you
know
keep
one
hand
on
your
wallet
and
the
other
hand
over
your
anal
pore
this
is
the
way
to
approach
all
of
this
belief
is
hideous
it's
also
completely
unnecessary
ideology
imagine
a monkey
walking
around
with the
idea
that
he
or
she
possesses
certain
truth
I
mean
you
have
to
lack
a sense
of
humor
to
not
see
the
absurdity
of
that
if
you
met
a
termite
who
told
you
he
was
on
a
quest
for
certain
truth
a
small
smile
would
tug
at
your
lips
I
hope
do
you
believe
for
a
moment
that
we
are
different
from
that
termite
I
think
not
I
think
not
we
understand
what
we
can
understand
we
build
models
to
do
this
without
realizing
the
tentative
nature
of
the
enterprise
is
just
damn
foolishness
here
my brother
put it
very well
one time
he said
have you
ever noticed
that
as we
build
the fire
of
understanding
brighter
the
greater
the volume
of
darkness
that is
revealed
or here
I'll put it
for you
in a
geometric
model
as the
sphere
of
understanding
expands
as the
sphere
of
understanding
expands
the
surface
area
of
ignorance
necessarily
grows
ever
larger
how
could
it
be
otherwise
so
then
get
a
grip
you
know
all
of
these
things
are
candles
lit
against
the
darkness
but
that's
why
I
say
the
thing
to
keep
coming
back
to
is
the
felt
presence
of
immediate
experience
not
how
do
I
feel
as a
feminist
or a
Marxist
or a
devotee
of
Hieronymus
Bosch
or
whatever
how
do
I
feel
period
not
through
the
filter
of
ideology
as I
look back
through
history
as you
look back
through
history
very few
ideologies
last
very long
without
going
sour
or
becoming
toxic
so
why
should
we
assume
as
all
those
naive
societies
in the
past
assumed
that
we
are
you
know
have
95%
of
the
truth
and
the
other
5%
will
be
delivered
by
our
best
people
in
the
next
three
years
people
fools
have
always
believed
that
but
the
smart
money
knows
we
ain't
even
close
you
know
you
cannot
today
explain
how
I
can
think
to
myself
make
a
fist
and
make
a
fist
what
you're
seeing
is
mind
over
matter
I
say
make
a
fist
I
make
a
fist
this
is
the
defeat
of
science
behaviorism
causal
theory
it's
defeated
by something
as simple
as that
so get
into the
mysteries
of the
body
the
felt
presence
of the
moment
somebody
else
here
oh
I don't
know
yes
I
must
say
usually
my
daily
meditations
are
accompanied
by
cannabis
which
I
don't
consider
high
pressure
psychedelic
but it
certainly
makes
meditation
more
tolerable
but you
raise an
interesting
question
which is
what is
the
preparation
for the
psychedelic
experience
meditation
is a
good one
engagement
with these
problems
is a
good one
I mean
think about
what you
want to
do
have
clarity
of intent
the way
I do
psychedelics
is
quite
infrequently
at
high
doses
on an
empty
stomach
in
silent
darkness
and
then
and I
add
this
this
is
how
I
do
it
but
everything
up to
there
I
advocated
the
final
thing
is
alone
and
that's a
biggie
for people
but
to me
that's
the
sine qua
non
because
if you
don't
go
alone
you
know
who
you
take
with
you
everybody
because
the
other
person
represents
the
cultural
system
inevitably
inevitably
I
mean
I'm
not
saying
you
should
never
take
psychedelics
with
people
you
love
and
respect
and
children
and
loved
ones
and
parents
and
all
that
but
the
deep
deep
work
you
know
Plotinus
called it
the flight
of the
alone
to
the
alone
the
deep
deep
work
has to
be
done
alone
because
dig it
the
last
dance
you
dance
you
will
dance
alone
and
I'm
you
know
I
see
this
pretty
much
in
Buddhist
terms
in
that
I
really
believe
at
death
there
is
some
kind
of
a
landscape
to
be
traversed
some
kind
of
a
process
to be
gone
through
and
that
it
is
critical
not
to
fuck
up
at
that
point
I
mean
they
all
insist
on
this
right
whatever
it
is
so
the
psychedelic
seemed
to me
to
show
the
way
into
the
bardo
I
once
turned
on
to
DMT
a
very
very
holy
Tibetan
man
not
one
of
these
Budweiser
llamas
but
the
real
McCoy
he
didn't
have
a
growth
center
or
a
patient
but
he
smoked
the
DMT
and
he
came
back
and
he
said
those
are
the
lesser
lights
he
said
you
cannot
go
further
than
that
and
return
and
I
believe
him
I
absolutely
believe
him
I
think
they've
seen
the
territory
so
there
is
something
about
and
I
made
the
analogy
earlier
to
the
collective
birth
be
prepared
and
these
psychedelics
are searchlights
out into
the
great
unknown
people
people
people
talk
about
recreational
drugs
and
all
that
I
regret
that
I
have
to
be
involved
with
all
of
that
I
take
drugs
very
seriously
not
that
I've
never
done
a
sub
dose
and
gone
to
a
rave
or
something
like
that
but
I
didn't
do
it
with
the
illusion
that
this
was
spiritual
work
I
did
it
to
dance
to
have
fun
with
my
friends
but
the
remarkable
thing
about
the
psychedelics
is
how
safe
they
are
at
levels
no
human
being
can
stand
you
know
I
mean
we
know
the
LD50
of
psilocybin
it's
hundreds
of
milligrams
per
kilogram
nobody's
ever
taken
more
than
40
or
50
milligrams
because
beyond
that
the
human
cognitive
machinery
can't
process
the
data
I
mean
it
is
literally
beyond
languaging
I
have
a
friend
who
every
time
he
takes
psilocybin
he
says
he
tries
to
stand
more
stand
more
and
I
know
exactly
what
he
means
I
have
conversations
with
that
entity
in
there
where
you
say
to
it
okay
you
know
the
dancing
mice
all
this
it's
very
nice
we're
feeling
pretty
comfortable
here
show
me
what
you
are
for
yourself
show
me
what
you
really
are
well
immediately
the
temperature
drops
black
draperies
begin
to lift
and there's
an organ
tone
straight out
of the
Bach
B minor
mass
that
shapes
the room
and after
about
30
seconds
you
say
enough
already
of what
you
really
are
for
yourself
because
you
realize
it
will
fulfill
the
request
it
can
lift
a
veil
on
vistas
of
reality
that
like
some
hero
in an
H.P.
Lovecraft
tale
you will
just
be
left
gibbering
for the
rest of
your
life
in a
very
small
cell
because
there are
truths
out there
that the
termite
mind
of man
I think
is not
ready
to
handle
the
reason
this
whole
non-local
thing
works
the way
it does
is because
we resonate
with what
is familiar
in other
words
the universe
is full
of things
no human
mind
can
cognize
or apprehend
but
because
we cannot
cognize
or apprehend
these things
we do not
even notice
them
they are
as it
were
in the
background
what's
in the
foreground
is
everything
at least
familiar
enough
that we
can relate
to it
as
strange
you know
the problem
is not
to encounter
the alien
but to
have enough
sense
to know
when it's
looking at
you
because it
ain't gonna
be like
you think
it is
that's the
one thing
you can
take
to the
back
yeah
back
there
do I
consider
psychedelics
a door
or a
window
interesting
question
I think
that until
recently
they were
a window
I think
they can
become
a door
here's
my
wrap
on this
this whole
business
about the
alien
and I
could have
spent the
whole hour
on a
different
tack
and gone
at it
but
the alien
is real
in some
sense
but not
real in
any sense
that I
think
would
satisfy
the
marketplace
here
assembled
the alien
is somehow
non-local
that means
that if
we really
want to
contact
the alien
we are
going to
have to
understand
that the
alien is
pure
information
the alien
is only
made of
information
is that
good news
or bad
news
it's good
news
here's why
it just so
happens at
this time
in history
we have
produced a
technology
that can
manipulate
pure
digital
information
the alien
needs to
be downloaded
into
cyber
space
it's not
for nothing
that the
net
is called
the net
it is a
net
for catching
an alien
you know
in all the
old
B science
fiction movies
of the
50s
one of the
tropes
of the
plot
was always
the
landing
zone
we must
build a
landing
zone
go to
the
landing
zone
locate
the
landing
zone
the net
is the
landing
zone
and
where
is
the
alien
the
alien
is
trapped
in the
deeper
interstices
of the
human
soul
but can
be
downloaded
onto the
internet
as a
virtual
reality
of some
sort
and this
you do
it very
slyly
you don't
announce
what I've
just
announced
you say
we're going
to hold
a contest
and we're
going to
have a
prize
for the
best
simulation
of a
psychedelic
experience
in VRML
in virtual
space
and you
hold this
contest
and you
hold it
the next
year
and the
next
year
and people
are inspired
to download
what they
think of
as their
weirdest
visions
but what
they don't
understand
is their
weirdest
visions
are the
weird
vision
in other
words
the
collective
oversoul
exists
dispersed
through all
of us
and if
we as
collective
projects
seek to
model it
to animate
it
to produce
a reasonable
simulacrum
of it
in virtual
reality
it will
come to
be
we will
summon it
out of
ourselves
and I
think at
a certain
point we
will
understand
the nature
of the
enterprise
the alchemist
dreamed of
something like
this
the summoning
into existence
of the
cosmic
anthropos
the mystic
atom
the
sophic
hydrolith
the
philosopher's
stone
the
lapis
philis
of
form
the
transcendental
object
at the
end of
time
once
again
the
living
heart
of
the
universal
panacea
now I
think
as we
move
into
the
empowering
of the
imagination
through
cyberspace
we can
actually
do this
we can
actually
bring
these
archetypes
if you
will
into
existence
in ways
that will
give them
a terrifying
immediacy
I mean
I have
visited
virtual
realities
of low
definition
slapped
together
in
fairly
short
order
and
it
shows
me
what
you
could
achieve
if
many
people
lovingly
crafted
and
tooled
these
things
we
would
discover
that
we
can
communicate
to
each
other
the
niagras
of
epiphanous
beauty
that pour
through
us
when
we
smoke
EMT
take
psilocybin
or
something
like
that
so
in
answer
to
the
gentleman's
question
psychedelics
were
a
window
until
the
advent
of
virtual
reality
and
the
internet
and
the
new
information
technologies
and
they
melded
to
psychedelic
intent
opened
the
possibility
of
opening
that
window
and
stepping
through
it
into
the
most
beautiful
dreams
human
beings
have
ever
dreamed
yeah
hum
hum
hmm
hmm
Thank you.
Yeah, well, this is a topic late in the game for this workshop, but there are, but people in all times and places have asked this question, is, okay, if we reduce it all down to nothing, then how do we build it back?
And philosophers have developed what are called razors or logical tools that allow this process to go forward.
The most famous razor, and the one that certainly could use some application around here, is Occam's razor, named after William of Occam, a 14th century nominalist.
Occam's razor says this, hypotheses should not be multiplied without necessity, or, translated into common vernacular English, keep it simple, stupid.
In other words, the simplest explanation is always to be preferred.
Never choose a more complicated explanation over the simpler explanation.
So, for example, a light is seen in the sky.
Simple explanation, aircraft.
Complex explanation, you know what.
The simpler explanation is to be preferred until further evidence forces its abandonment.
And God knows, even with this razor in place, you're forced to some pretty complicated hypotheses by some situations.
But if you will rely on your own intuition, the felt presence of immediate experience, and logical razors, another good one, I call this one the Gorbachev razor.
Trust, but verify.
Trust, but verify.
You know, it's okay to trust, as long as you verify.
This keeps you out of trouble.
So, these are simply the rules of mental hygiene that are no longer taught because commercial interests have determined that people who don't know these things are easily manipulated in the marketplace, and people who do know these things are not.
It's horrifying to realize that whether you can think straight or not is a decision being made for you by the Fortune 500 corporations.
Is it one more argument for overcoming culturally reinforced childishness?
One more, and then we're going to have to clear this for Whitley Stieber, who has lots to say to you, I'm sure.
Over here.
Well, I'm certainly a printhead formed by it and formed by McLuhanism.
I'm not an angry printhead.
In other words, I don't like all this denouncing of youth and all this talk about cyber-driven illiteracy and all that.
First of all, I don't think it's true.
I think people who spend hours and hours a day on the Internet are exposed to vast amounts of information that synchronistically or otherwise forms their opinion.
I think the printed word at this point is a glorious art.
It's funny you should ask this question.
Here it is, 1997.
We have many things to celebrate this year in America, the mission to Mars, for example.
But one thing we have to celebrate that probably hasn't been mentioned here today is American literature is alive and well.
Thomas Pynchon has written a brilliant new novel, a novel that will make you proud to be a reader of English and an American, a novel called Mason and Dixon.
Don DeLillo, a very different sort of writer, has written a brilliant end-of-the-century statement called Underworld.
American Art and Letters is very healthy.
And actually, that leads me to the final thought that I want to leave you with, which is the way to react to all of this stuff is not to believe or to denounce or to...
The way to relate to what is happening to us is to produce art.
Put the art pedal to the floor.
If you paint, if you sculpt, if you write poetry, if you dance, if you declaim, whatever you do, that is the oversoul trying to come through.
We are never closer to the quintessence of the human collectivity than when we produce art.
These are the larger semiotic messages that are seeking to pass between us.
And no one who creates art fully understands their own art.
But if they create it out of honesty and from close to the bone, it can't fail to elevate.
We don't have to understand what is happening to us to affirm our humanness and to contribute to the future that is unfolding.
Thank you very, very much.
