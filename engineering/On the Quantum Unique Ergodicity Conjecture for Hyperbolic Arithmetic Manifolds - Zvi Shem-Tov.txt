so it's uh a pleasure to have
we can't give us the top column
this room is not fully transformed yet but it's already
nice when it used to be particularly nice to have
thank you and so
the talk is about eigenfunctions of the
laplacian on the compact Riemannian manifolds
but to give you some feeling of the problem
start with discussing planar domains
so suppose you have some planar domains
in fact some nice shapes omega
only you have the laplacian
given by dx by y squared
acting on the functions of this and and
and we look at the solution to this laplacian
with the boundary condition that vanishes
and boundary we can take an autonormal basis of such eigenfunctions
the eigenvalues are automatically
tending to infinity in absolute value
and for each of those functions
we define this probability measure
even by integrating against the absolute
phi d squared of phi j so these measures
have a very standard interpretation in physics
they give the
probability distribution for the position of a
quantum particle in states in those pure states
phi j
and so here in the picture we see two kinds of domains
so one of them is the disk the other one is the stadium
and these pictures are those
given those those measures for a typical
sort of eigenfunction with the eigenvalue very high
and so we see here a big difference
for the disk you see a lot of geometric structure
you see that you have this
white towards the center of the disk
whereas here for this this domain
is called the stadium basically just a rectangle
and two semicircles on the sides
you see a much more chaotic picture
i mean you see that it's somehow
evenly distributed along the domain
so if this room was bigger you could
barely distinguish between those two
and that's the point here
all right so what's the reason for this
difference between the two domains
this is very well understood
and is related to the corresponding
classical dynamical systems
which is given by
a billiard ball that moves in straight lines
and follow the standard law of reflection
so here you see typical trajectories of
this billiard ball and again here you see
this geometric pattern
and here you see that it is
more equidistant with a long space
so this kind of system
this kind of system we call
ergonic means that typical trajectories
distribute
and basically
this is the reason for the difference
we saw before it's a consequence of that
is it related to billiard of sinai
is it related to a sinai
uh ergodicity
to sinai ergodicity
yes
that is a sin
that is banimovich
banimovich yeah sinai and banimovich
yeah
study that
okay
and
so because of the something called the
correspondence
uh
you know usually is you have a
remover scatters in the middle and then
it's much much more clear where it's
chaotic this is a very subtle
construction of banimovich
and so it is known that there is a
connection between
the distribution of those eigenfunctions
and the classical dynamics
let me take the eigenvalue of the
energy
energy
to infinity
now
this
so to say this much more
rigorously
and there is this
quantum ergodicity theorem
of
uh
schnellmann
zedich and corinthiridia
who predict in various settings
independently
which tells you that
if the classical dynamics is
ergonic
then most eigenfunctions
equidistributed in this
most here is there
is very important
the question is
whether you can remove this
world most here
so what do i mean by most eigenfunctions
equidistribute
you look at weak limits
of those measures
mu j
from before
and the statement here
is that
for a density one
subsequence
the
the wixxel limit
is going to be the uniform measure
on the domain
so the answer to this question
is no
in general
you can have
an egotic billiard
and still have some
weak limits
that are not
like you distribute
like this
basically the reason
for the
so
those were constructed
by hustle
using this kind of
trajectories
that are called
the bouncing ball
which is only
mildly
chaotic
and now the question is
what happens
if we take much more
chaotic systems
cause more chaos
into the
into the problem
the stadium is not
an ellipsis
it is a horizontal
ellipsis
it's a horizontal
line and semester
ellipsis
ellipsis
remarkably
integrable
i see
right
it's a wonderful
thing
because it's
otherwise
no
i believe it
is an exercise
the mass problem
in euclidean
there are
conformal ellipses
confocal ellipses
are integrals
of the motion
once tangent
over
when focal
ellipsis
you always
so this is many orbits
there's not one orbit
this is one orbit
it just
it
it
it
it
essentially
and then
comes back
and it takes
it a lot
of time
time to
so basically
you have one
parameter
family
of closed
hovers
yeah
yeah
how does it
come back
does it hit
that
it's a one parameter
family
so for us
the order
for strongly
chaotic systems
is going to be just
hyperbolic manifolds
they have
negative curvature
what it means
is that if you start
with two very close
points
in your surface
then the geodesic
corresponding to geodesic
can diverge
very fast
so this is a picture
of the hyperbolic surface
and difficult geodesic
on it
and for those
kind of spaces
the quantum
eucodicity conjecture
of
Kurnik and Sarnak
states that you
always have
equidistribution
so just
to state it
formally
so we have
a compact
hyperbolic manifold
it is
always a quotient
of hyperbolic space
hn by
some discrete
group of
isometries
gamma
phi j
again
eigenfunctions
of the
Laplacian
and
we define
the sequence
of probability measures
in the same way
and ask
what the
which star limits are
so
so here
the role of
this billiard
trajectory
is going to be
displayed by
the geodesic flow
so
so
in this lecture
I'm going to
focus
on a very
special kind
of such
aquatic manifolds
which are
the
contour
congruence
manifolds
or
thematic manifolds
this is the most
famous example
where you take
as your
lattice of
phasometries
sr2z
which acts
by
transformations
integral
transformations
on the
upper half plane
although in this
example
this is not
you don't get
a compact
space
but still
have
finite volume
and you can
ask the same
question
and this is
an illustration
of the
fundamental
domain
of this
lattice
now
on those
arithmetic
manifolds
there is a
very special
phenomenon
that was
discovered
about
hundreds of
years ago
turns out that
there are
some additional
symmetries
other than
the
laplacian
which comes
from the
the
arithmetic
structure
of the
number
theoretic
structure
so
this is
realized by
the
hacker
operators
so what
are those
hacker
operators
basically
you look
at
the
hacker
operators
are some
discrete
averaging
operators
defined
by
correspondences
correspondence
for us
is just
you take
a point
on your
manifold
x
and I
give you
a finite
set of
points
of points
in the
manifold
and the
hacker
operator
is
acting
by
taking
the
sun
over
those
points
this finite
set of
points
but it's
not
any
set of
points
will be
good for
us
it has
a lot
geometric
structure
and the
key
point
here
is
that
those
operators
commute
with the
Laplacian
so we can
take
joint
eigenfunctions
and we
get
so-called
automorphic
forms
which are
extensively
studied
in
context
of
number
theory
so this
is
an
example
of
a
classical
vector
operator
in dimension
two
on the
surface
so
here again
is a fundamental
domain for
this
SN2Z
and if I take
a prime number
in this case
three
then if
this is our
initial point
then this is
the set
of
of
hacker
points
which we
take an
average
this is an
example of a
classical
hacker
operator
now for this
lecture we need
a different
point of view
of these
hacker
operators
we need to
define them
slightly
differently
so
for this
so recall
again
that
HN
is the
n-dimensional
hyperbolic
space
alpha space
is an
example of a
symmetric space
is always
given by
a
quotient
of
Lie group
by a
compact
subgroup
so this
Lie group
is a
group of
isometrists
acting on
HN
transitively
in this case
so
N1
and if
you take
the
stabilizer
of a
point
and quotient
by it
then
you get
this
presentation
of the
hyperbolic
N space
now
this is a
real Lie group
group
but we
can obtain
it by
by the
real points
of an
algebraic
group G
which is
defined over
the rational
numbers
this is
just
this is
given by
a set
of rational
equations
and when
we take
the real
points
we get
our
Lie group
S-O-N1
also
we can
do this
in various
different
ways
and this
is going
to give
us
various
lattices
gamma
which are
the
integral
points
of
algebra
now
just like
we have
this
real
symmetric
space
G
mod
k
we can
get
a
symmetric
space
by
taking
the
periodic
points
of our
algebra
group
and taking
the quotient
by
the
maximal
compact
subgroup
of it
which is
the
zp
points
of our
group
G
and we
have
this
symmetric
space
which is
in a way
analogous
to this
real
symmetric
space
in the case
of
for dimension
two
you just
get the
p plus
one
regular
three
so in
picture
now
we all
also have
this
g
of
z
one
over
p
this
acts diagonally
on this
product
two groups
and this is
the lattice
here
now with
this notation
we get this
presentation of
g mod
gamma
as a
g times
gp
modulo
this lattice
and
modulo
kp
on the right
and this
presentation gives
us
sort of foliation
of g mod
gamma
of this
homogeneous
space
by
many many
copies
of this
those
pi symmetric
spaces
so for example
in dimension
two
we somehow
foliate
our surfaces
by
p plus one
regular
trees
and the
echo correspondence
is going to
just be
like the
the set of
points
which corresponds
to each of
those points
points x
is just
the sphere
something which
I call
the sphere
in the
in those
geodex
geometric spaces
so for trees
for example
this is
indeed
the sphere
in the metric
of the tree
and the other
cases
it is
sets like this
kp
t kp
where t is
any element
of gp
you can see
easily
that this is
finite
because this
state is
discrete
and kp
is compact
does the sphere
mean
set of equidistant
points
from some
center
in some
metric
no
but
for the
three years
in more generally
not exactly
but that's
how I think
of it
and that's
how I want
you to
so that's
the
the attack
foliation
so for example
in the
two-dimensional
case
you exactly
get
the
the
glass
laplacian
each
of those
slits
now
arithmetic
quantum
nucleogonicity
is exactly
the same
question
this
equidistribution
problem
only for
those special
kinds
of
eigenfunctions
of the
laplacian
which are
also
eigenfunctions
of those
operators
and these
are called
Hecke mass
forms
so
this
question
this
problem
was
solved
by
Elon
Linestrauss
2006
for
compact
congruence
surfaces
and
so in fact
again
this
problem
considered
also for
non-compact
portions
like
this
famous
modular curve
here
and for
this
Linestrauss
methods
only proved
that the
limiting
measure
is
proportional
to the
uniform
measure
and then
that it
is actually
a probability
measure
was proved
by
Sander
or
Jan
this is
called
non-escape
of mass
the space
is not
compact
you have
the
possibility
that some
of the
measure
can escape
to the
casp
you need
to rule
this out
separately
now the
main focus
on this
talk
is about
this
question
path
for
higher dimensional
hyperbolic
manifolds
now
what you can
think is
okay
so
Linestrauss
proved this
can we use
more or less
the same
methods
or the
same
ideas
to prove
it in
higher
dimensional
case
I didn't
tell you
anything
about the
proof
so the
the point
is that
that in
in a
higher
dimension
there is
a new
feature
when you
take a
larger
group
you have
many
many
intermediate
subgroups
that can
cause
problems
that those
measure
rigidity
techniques
of
Linestials
basically
do not
see
so here
here is
a very
typical
problem
so forget
equidistribution
forget anything
you just have
the limit
measure
mu
right
if it
is the
uniform
measure
then of
course
it gives
measure
zero
to any
sub
manifold
of lower
dimension
so prove
that
for every
totally geodesic
sub manifold
of co-dimension
one
this measure
is zero
that's
the
the
typical
problem
that
we're gonna
want to
understand
now
so for
surfaces
dimension
two
those
totally
geodesic
spaces
are basically
closed geodesics
and to show
that they
have
measure
zero
follows
from
some
positive
entropy
estimates
were done
by
Bruggen
and Linestials
that were
actually part
of this
whole machinery
of Linestials
for proving
that the measure
is uniform
so in the sense
that this is
this comes from
free
if you already
have
what you need
to apply
all those
techniques
notice also
that in this
case
those
closed geodesics
are
small
compared to
the
ambient
manifold
at least
in the sense
that they have
dimension
they have
half the dimension
but if we
take the
bigger dimension
right
then those
co-dimensional
one
co-dimensional
manifold
is going to
have
much bigger
dimension
with the
ratio
so in
three dimensions
showing this
is one of our
main results
showing that
for
three
hyperbolic
manifolds
the limiting
measure
also
you do it
for
three dimensions
which
arithmetic
manifolds
are you doing
with
all
arithmetic
or special
arithmetic
on
congruence
they come
from
quadratic
forms
or they
could
come
from
there's
a
classification
that's
quite
complicated
of
congruence
which
ones did
you deal
with
kinds
kinds
questions
I
take
chris
also
he needs
to start
somewhere
we take
any form
of sl2
and you
take
the
restriction
of
scalars
so there
are some
funny
forms
that
come
and come
from
tits
I think
basically
as long
as you
can
present
it
in
one way
or another
as g
of z
I can
handle
I'll give
you an
example
of a
problem
that was
solved
for
quadratic
forms
and
for
all
forms
that
you
are
thinking
about
this
problem
of
aigle
that
aigle
eventually
solved
this
every
hyperbolic
three manifold
there's a
finite
index
subgroup
covered
with a
positive
Betty
number
even
in the
arithmetic
cases
this
was not
solved
and the
one
missing
case
was
exactly
these
very
exotic
forms
of
tits
so
i'm just
saying
that
you
i'm just
alerting
you to
this
fact
that there
are
some
and nobody
ever has
made that
work
in those
cases
what are
those
faults
i mean
if you
give me
they come
from some
division
algebras
of certain
types
which with
some
accidental
thing
becomes
the
question
for me
is that
i'm not
saying your
methods
don't work
all right
i mean
yeah
what i'm trying
to say
is that
our methods
are
very well
defined
in a sense
so if
if i know
the definition
of her life
i should know
immediately
and then
but i'm just
saying that
many
ragunathan
bubatsky
all of these
guys fell
into this trap
of claiming
that they
can
and it's
and it's got
to do
with
with
uh
totally
geodesic
so
i'm just
saying
that
i've got
a red
flag
in my head
and
all right
same
but your methods
i would imagine
i'm just saying
once i see the
definition i can tell you
i guess
and so you mentioned
i'm doing a borella
here
i could have already
before when you talk
about gcp
he would get very
excited when people
would put the
knowledge there
oh yeah there's several
definitions
yeah
of course
i like the whole
paper
yeah it's not always
possible to take
gcp
and so in dimension
four
in any single case
we can't rule this
this thing out
and that's the only
uh barrier from
proving
alphabetically in this
case
this was a
very specific
kind of
lattices
and now
interestingly
if you look at
in four dimensions
and you look at
two-dimensional
sub-manifolds
then this problem
then showing that
the measure is zero
turns out to be
much much harder
than this
you have to use
much more delicate
uh things
right so this
already tells you
that looking
at the dimension
is not the
correct way
to measure
how big is
sub
that's where the
difficulties come from
now before i
explain our
methods and
what we actually
know let me just
state the results
so again here
i am
i'm not claiming
anything about
what kind of
what is it
further than
the congress
uh
latices
you're just
talking
you might
then you can
turn an algebra
of a number field
that's uh
that's uh
with copies of h2
yeah yeah
and that's fine
yeah maybe more than
i'm
yes
at least that
uh
okay so
as you said so again
not only for uh
a robotic three
manifolds but for
products of uh
uh copies of h2
and s copies of
h3 or in other words
as a two over
number of feet
so for this case
we completely
prove a quantum
iniquity
including non-compact
quotients
because
the original
argument of
sound for the
two-dimensional case
just
more or less
walks
in this setting
as well
now for four dimensions
we don't quite get
uh
qub
again what we
but we put
very
i would say
strong
constraints of the
measure
so that's what we
prove we prove
that that any
limiting measure
must be
a countable
convex combination
of either
the harm measure
the uniform measure
or
some uniform measures
on the
three-dimensional
hyperbolic
sub-manifolds
so in particular
if you can
show that
that any of them
has measure zero
then
you prove
the
qu
also here
this is not just
a linear combination
I wrote convex
to emphasize
that
here as well
we saw
this problem
of escape
of mass
in the joint
world with
the favori
although here
the showing escape
of mass
becomes
a harder
problem
so
so in the
two-dimensional
case
and the
three-dimensional
case
the
main tool
for showing
it
is taking
a Fourier
extension
of your
form
with Fourier
coefficients
a n
and using
the fact
that they
satisfy some
relations
of this
form
and
in those
works
they use
substantially
of the fact
that those
relations are
bounded
so the
nth coefficient
is expressed
as a sum
of two
other
coefficients
it completely
breaks down
starting
in the
four-dimensional
case
then you get
those kind
of relations
but it
with unbounded
and number
of terms
like linear
and p
placed in
four dimensions
so you have
to find
some more
cancellations
in your work
let me ask
you a
conceptual
question
if you're
a physicist
you would
go to
the
phase
phase
yes
and you go
to the
group
where you
make
you haven't
discussed
the
microlocal
lift
but you're
proving
a much
stronger
theorem
you're
proving
that the
microlocal
lifts
are
do you
relate
them
in
higher
dimensions
to
the
physics
phase
space
or
do you
just
discuss
it
no
i
i mean
because
i only
restrict myself
to hyperbolic
manifolds
here
now there's
still a
unit tangent
i mean
the question
is
if you
want to
think
of it
physically
in higher
dimensions
then you
should go
to phase
space
which is
also
always
well defined
for the
jet
sq club
of course
so then
i just
cautioned
here
that they
there's
a different
in sl2
these are
the same
thing
but when
you're
in the
higher
dimensions
you have
the same
flow
but i
mean
how
when you
lift it
it sort
of naturally
i mean
the only way
i know
how to
lift it
would be
invariant
under this
difference
between them
so basically
in this case
exactly
you have
this
if you
look
at
kohlen de
that's
what
nothing
to do
with dimension
so you
have
phase
space
i'm just
saying
i don't
i mean
i'm saying
that i don't
know how
to phrase
a question
about
the frame
bundle
i mean
the way
i know
how
to lift
eigenfunctions
to the
same
bundle
is by
trivially
averaging
over this
s
but why
not to
g
mod
m
yeah
exactly
the phase
space
all right
so i think
your theorem
contains that
state
no i think
it's not
no
i think
you have
a refinement
i don't think
so i think
it's basically
i don't know
how to lift
i mean
the question
is how to
do the
micro
not correct
you do
it's automatically
invariant
under this
end
so you can
question
so it's
basically
is
i don't know
how to do
basically
only
i don't know
how to get
some kind
of insulting
statement
about this
lens
though
okay
anyway i think
i'm just
pointing out
this is something
you should have
a good answer
to
hey
like if
zeldic were in
the audience
i think
that's a micro
local list
if i take here
instead of
k if i take
m then i get
exactly
different
yes
yeah
so i think
all right
right
so i think
you contain
i think
you have more
information
i don't think
i want to follow
your point is
that the equal
distribution is
actually on
something a little
bit bigger
yes
okay
because they're
working out
bravely
yeah
you're pushing
out
right
so i'm trying
to relate
which in sl2
are the same
thing yeah
because the unit
tangent bundle
is yeah
yeah it's just
yeah yeah
but in general
it's different
and so it should
be discussed
that's all
i do claim
that that i
that that's
my result
contains it
i also think
so
anyway you should
think it through
that's all
i'm saying
all right
once you get
i think
it's
that's
i mean
the natural
thing is to
lift
i mean
this is
uh
silverman's thesis
i forgot
i'm sure i discussed
it with him
but the natural
thing is to
lift it
and that's
once you're
doing lead
groups
but since
you started
out
by explaining
i know
i know
phase space
it should
you should connect
it yeah
i thought maybe
i should
somebody will
ask you this
question
as you tour
the world
so that's
so my
my answer
to it
is yes
thank you
so i think
it's true
yeah
we can discuss
it off
um
okay
so the micro
locality
is a very
important construction
in this uh
context
uh
do you
do uh
schmiermann at least
it's schmiermann's
definition
and
what you do
it turns out that
okay so
so
i just
i'll just
state it
in this uh
in this setting
so because
you have this
presentation of
of your space
then you have
this bundle
gmod
gamma
and the statement
is that
every
wick limit
you can
lift
this space
so it projects
onto you
this lift
is muted
and the important
property of it
is that
it is
invariant
under the
the action
of a certain
subgroup
so genius
dynamics
it comes into
the picture
so what is
this subgroup
is
i call it
the geodesic
flow
it's in one
parameter
diagonal
diagonal
diagonal
subgroup
at
c
so if you think
of the
sl2
it's just a group
of diagonal
matrices
and if you think
of
so
1n
it's again a group
of diagonal
matrices
one variety
group of
diagonal
and then
the other important
property because
we only know
how to treat
arithmetic
settings
then
the thing is that
what you get
that we represent
as a weak limit
of measures
coming from
eigenfunctions
of the Hecker
operations
we don't need
the Laplacian
anymore
but it's important
that our
limits
on gmod
gamma
which we now
consider
comes from
eigenfunctions
of Hecker
and in fact
that's that's
exactly
what we're
going to do
we're going
to show
that those
weak limits
are necessarily
a uniform
so in particular
mu
is uniform
okay
so now
one approach
once we have
this micro
openness
that's exactly
our approach
is to try
to classify
what kind
of 18
invariant
measures
do we
even get
okay
if the
the geodesic
flow
this is
this place
there was
the geodesic
flow
and I told
you
this is
ergodic
and very
very chaotic
you might
think
that there
is
no
no
invariant
measures
at all
other than
the uniform
measure
on
gmod
gamma
and similar
statements
are
indeed
true
if we
would
consider
different
kind
of
flows
unipotent
flows
we have
ratna's
theory
so the
bad news
is that
in this
case
there are
plenty
of
of
invariant
measures
that we
should
try to
rule out
so the
very rough
distinction
between
the
between
those
invariant
measures
are
so
there are
nice
invariant
measures
which are
basically
homogeneous
measures
so those
are just
measures
that are
supported
on
orbits
of
nice
subgroups
that
contains
this
AT
flow
and also
convex
combinations
of those
homogeneous
but on the
other hand
there are
those
not so
nice
measures
okay
so this
is
not
very
hard
thing
to see
that
indeed
in the case
of this
geodesic
flow
you have
orbit closures
that are
actually
factors
cantor
cells
and how
and the way
you should think
of the
the measure
rigidity
technology
lindal shows
and
is there
is that
it tells you
that if
certain
non-localization
properties
are true
then
you know
you can be sure
that your
your limit
that your measure
your
AT
invariant measure
and this has
nothing to do
with limits
of eigenfunctions
okay
is a convex
combination
of homogeneous
measures
so it's nice
so in the case
of two-dimensional
surfaces
this
almost enough
to show
QUE
because you
don't have
many
nice measures
basically
the only nice
measure that you
have is the
uniform measure
and maybe measures
that are supported
on closed geodesics
and we said
that this
you can roll out
into this
perspective
quite easily
but
as soon as you
go to higher
dimensions
the family of
those
nice
measures
become very
very big
and that's
the main source
of difficulties
so
I guess
there's two
those conditions
that are specified
in this
theorem
which is a
generalization
of the original
measure classification
of linear
starts
I just
say that
in ongoing
projects
we're not
actually using
any of those
results
as is
we
sort of
go through
the arguments
themselves
and take
what we
need
so
there are
some
redundancies
here
which
you might
see
so
the first
condition
is called
recurrence
just
maybe
the most
important
condition
although it's
the easiest
one to prove
and it's
true in general
for any
semantic space
I'm just
going to
ignore it
the positive
entropy condition
on almost
every body
component
is very
challenging
and I'm
not going to
define
what
entropy
is
for us
basically
what you
should think
of is
that
epsilon
tubes
of
the
of your
flow
decay
polynomially
with epsilon
but here
again we have
a new difficulty
because the
centralizer
of the flow
is not
trivial
anymore
and in fact
in the sense
that I'm
going to
discuss
soon
it is
very big
so this
condition
which is
completely
necessary
today
is for
these
methods
so this we
don't know
we don't have
any clue
to prove it
or if it's
even true
in any
dimension
that's
bigger than
six
dimension
five
we know
how to show
and
also
these conditions
not no
non-exception
arbiters
that I'm going
to just skip
okay but now
what I want
to focus on
is that
suppose that
we have
all those
non-localizations
properties
and then
we have
this conclusion
of the theory
that our measure
is a
convex combination
of homogeneous
measures
how do we
show that
the measure
is actually
the uniform
measure
and the methods
I'm going to
discuss now
were more or
less
related also
do
showing
those
definitions
so how do you
prove
non-concentration
and
so I'm going to
be a little bit
more technical
now
and
speak about
about the proof
a little bit
so suppose you have
a homogeneous measure
and it is supported
on some
nice subgroup
H
like this
one thing you can
show
it's more or
less standard
is that
since this is
periodic
it is contained
in a set
that looks like
this
so this
it might look
like an orbit
of a nice group
but it's not
h0n
h0n is not a group
and it's
it's crucial
because this
h0 times n
is not a group
all of the methods
that were used
the methods
that were used
by
for the entropy
and everything
everything fails
basically
so you have to
deal with this
fact that
it's not
an orbit of a group
but rather
some kind of
a bucket
of orbits
or a union
of many
many orbits
so here
h0
is some
irrational
subgroup
subgroup of g
it means it's
defined by
irrational equations
containing the flow
and the
m
is a
compact
subgroup
which is
popular
of
so
n minus 1
so here again
you can see
the degeneracy
of the case
n equals 2
which makes
m trivial
so
we have this
and since
there are
at most
countably
many such
sets
it's enough
to prove
that the measure
of each one
of them
is zero
and how do
we do
this
so another
observation
is that
you can
look at
m and say
okay it's
it's a
combustible
how bad
can it be
to the point
it's
it can be
very bad
m is always
compact
we're going to
look at
the
language
okay
so
what i'm gonna
talk about now
is something
called the
amplification
method
i think
the term
and the
method
you
to
jona
or
if
you
have
it
right
and
so
the
the
very
basic
idea
i'm
standard
by now
in this context
we introduced
in this one
is to take
a
HECA operator
tau
okay so
this is an
averaging
operator
with some
over
some
translates
of
and so
because
and you can
expect that
because you
do this
you somehow
somehow what you
get the
the mass
is controlled
by the
intersection
pattern
of those
translates
neighborhoods
that you take
and epsilon
here is
is my
notation for
an epsilon
neighborhood
of the set
L
okay and
on the other
hand
if f is an
eigenfunction
then on the other
hand you can
divide by
by the eigenvalue
or some
power of the
eigenvalue
to get a rough
bound like this
so you can
bound the
mass of an
epsilon
neighborhood
by some
function that
depends on
how on the
intersection
pattern of
the translates
of this
neighborhood
over the
eigenvalue
of this
operator
now if you
look at this
intersection
and take
s prime
to b1
you can see
that the
condition that
this is not
the empty
set
is that
s is
containing
this
set
now if
L
is a group
or at least
a piece of
a group
containing
the identity
element
then again
you're
again
get
some small
neighborhood
of a group
and then
you can
apply
the
fountaine
arguments
to show
that you're
counting
problem
to reduce
your counting
problem
to a genuine
subgroup
it's very
similar
to L
so now if
you want
to apply
this
for a
for a
dose
then you
can just
use the
fact that
there are
not many
rational points
that intersect
the tors
but if
your group
is not
the tors
it becomes
much
so that's
the summary
of this
method
you basically
want to
construct
some
hacker
operator
which on
one hand
you can
control
the intersections
of those
hacker
translates
the other
and you
want the
eigenvalue
to be
big
now
to
to deal
with those
large
subgroups
that they
told you
about
which are
not
not
torre
anymore
you have
to have
some
much more
delicate
method
and this
way
I wanted
to relate
it to
another
problem
which
on first
side
seemed
completely
unrelated
to it
this is
the
sup-norm
problem
the problem
is to
give
non-trivial
upper
bounds
on the
n-infinity
so
of course
Iwani
and I
did this
and then
when
Elon was
trying to
make
positive
entropy
I didn't
realize
that he
secretly
knew
that once
he gets
a little
bit of
entropy
he could
go the
whole
way
so
of course
I
never
Rudnick
and I
did this
calculation
just to
show you
can't
concentrate
on a
periodic
right
so we
didn't
feel like
quantifying
it
but he
had a
little
secret
up
his
so
these
are
very
related
what he
did
with
Bergen
and what
he managed
about
the
diversion
we
just
never
so
this
is
the
first
place
where
I
even
mentioned
something
when
to take
it
right
yeah
for
that
all right
so
so
in
general
if you
take
x1
equals
zero
here
then
this
is
a
general
upper
bound
for
the
for
for
eigenfunctions
on
symmetric
spaces
where n
is the
dimension
and r
is the
rank
so
for
example
for
surfaces
this
is
lambda
to
a
half
but
you
can
get
an
extra
very
explicit
epsilon
that
the
first
result
in this
direction
of
Ivan
and
Sarnak
and
Simon
Marshall
considered
a much
much
more
general
setting
than
just
surfaces
he took
a general
symmetric
space
so here's
a theorem
due to
Marshall
if you
take
a simple
e-group
g
and
require
some
little
theoretic
assumptions
it is
quite a
split
it is
not
then
you get
that
this
power
saving
so this
is
so
what's
the
essence
of those
requirements
so first
of all
note
that
for
our
in our
situation
if we
take
g
to be
also
one
four
for example
then
this theorem
fails
it is
not
quite
it is
related
in a
different
manner
so
those
conditions
on the
league
groups
and the
league
group
g
guarantee
the following
so
if you
take
h
to be
a sub
group
of g
such that
h of r
is a
maximal
compact
sub
group
of g
that's
what
Marshall
considered
then the
conditions
of the
of the
theorem
tells you
that
h
right
the algebraic
group h
the rational
group h
is weakly
small
is
small in a
certain sense
in what
sense
so loosely
speaking
what it means
is this
um
so again
we have
this
this
theadic
spheres here
and this
is a finite
set
you can
give an
expression
for its
size
what we want
that if
we if
we take
the sphere
for the
same element
t but
in our
theadic
subgroup
hp
then the
size of
this sphere
is at
most part
of the
size
of the
sphere
in the
bilion group
gp
so in fact
what
Marshall
needed is
something
slightly
slightly
stronger than
this
he wanted
some power
saving
here
so this
condition
is
more well
known as
being
tempered
this is
slightly
slightly
more than
right
so using
this
and there
is a
a way
to make
this
a global
definition
so to
guarantee
that
in terms
of the
algebraic
closure
you
you guarantee
that this
this
is satisfied
for
positive proportion
of friends
and that
that's
what
Marshall
uses
and the
point
that
we use
those
kind
of
techniques
of those
those
counting
methods
of Marshall
in the context
context of
QEW
and we show
that if L
is indeed
weakly small
then we have
this
polynomial decay
for the
epsilon
for epsilon
tubes
this is
it seems
very different
from
estimating
how big
is the value
of one
point
so this
in particular
shows that
the positive
entropy condition
is satisfied
if
this
centralizer
of the
flow
is weakly
small
in this
sense
which breaks
down
starting
dimension
six
now
recall that
we didn't
want to show
that
that
an orbit
of
of a sub
has measured
zero
we had something
which is
not a
group
this is
important
so in fact
if this
is not
a group
all of
those
results
just
completely
fails
you can't
amplify
because
the
epsilon
neighborhood
once you
take
the product
with its
inverse
you get
an open
set
and
okay
translates
or equidistribility
so you can't
expect
just
counting
arguments
will give
you anything
in this
for those
kind of
sets
and what
we do
we found
a nice
argument
to deal
with this
which is
the main
point of
our 3d
results
it turns out
that you don't
have to
count
everything
you don't
have to
count
all the
returns
just some
of them
the ones
that we call
parallel
so you
have two
kinds
of
returns
for your
atrium
tube
if
the intersection
looks like
this
it intersects
in a lower
dimensional
manifold
that
turns out
that you can
deal with it
by induction
of the dimension
you have to be
very careful
because some
many parameters
there have to be
uniform
but you can do
this and reduce
the problem
to count
what we call
parallel intersections
and so
the
the final
result
which
lets us
prove that
those
those measures
are zero
is this
theorem
you take
your
your set
l if you want
to show
its measure
is zero
if you show
that
each of
its real
sub-varieties
l prime
has rational
stabilizers
that are
quickly small
in some sense
in this sense
of marshall
then it's
measured
by this
so now
finally
i want to discuss
and so what should
we expect
for those
samples
that are not
quickly small
so
there is this
there is a
very
non-construction
of photomorphic
forms
which are
lifts
from smaller
groups
and
they're known
to have
very
odd
properties
so for example
they
they
people have
used them
to
to construct
sort of
counter examples
sequences
to
in the
in the
sup-norm
problem
to construct
sequences
for which
the
sup-norm
is much
bigger
than
the
generic
expectation
okay
so in
in four dimensions
also one three
is not small
that's
that's what
that's why
you can prove
QUE
instead of
the
half
in the
exponent
in the
definition
of quickly
small
you get
two over
three
however
for
certain
kind of
lifts
we were
in a
work in progress
with the
February
we can show
UUE
for
for a
density one
subsequence
but this uses
the fact
that those
this
specific
sequence
violates
the
so-called
ramanujan
conjecture
so it is
not
non-temporary
so on the
other
hand
so what
what's
happening
so the
question is
what
what happens
with the
remaining
eigen
functions
in those
very
specific
constructions
you know
so in
in the
higher
dimension
basically
I don't see
any reason
to believe
to believe
that those
limits
cannot
be concentrated
on those
very
large
manifolds
but that
I don't
have any way
to justify
it yet
I have a
naive
question
from
physicists
physicists
would be
wondering
what happens
if you take
your stadium
and make
a three-dimensional
object
by rotating
it like
a tube
with two
spherical cups
that is
something
where you
could study
eigenvalues
and eigenfunction
and I'm
not sure
about
integrability
but what
about
organicity
for this
the minute
you rotate
the minute
you ever
rotate
yeah
well you
take
horizontal
axis
and make
rotation
no
but what
you can
take
you can
take
a few
a flat
and attach
to it
something
at the
side
yeah
you can
make it
I'm just
saying it's
not rotation
he's got a
way of
giving a
geodesic
flow
a metric
on s2
for which
a geodesic
flow
is
a godic
and positive
and
what is
the measure
entropy
that's
correct
but yeah
you can
ask
these questions
are very
hard to
answer
because
the physicists
have
for
everything
physicists
claims
on this
problem
is
false
everything
in other
words
if you
say
chaos
implies
um
qub
that sort
of thing
i think
is false
not we know
it's false
in certain
examples
or if you
ask about
the eigenvalues
where they should
behave like
random matrices
that's definitely
false
but it's
generically
true
these things
are probably
generically
true
in the space
of Hamiltonians
that's
probably
for the
physicist
it would be
like that
there is
a set
of classical
trajectories
and the
quantum probability
of the square
of wave
function
is peaked
around each
trajectory
so
you have
matter
which is
right
but the point
is that each
in this very
strongly chaotic
negatively curved
setting
each closed
periodic orbit
is isolated
and unstable
you can't
construct
the quasi-mode
around it
i see
and so
people
from the beginning
thought that you
could not see
the relation
between classical
and quantum mechanics
in this limit
but when people
started to do
numerics
and you saw those
pictures in the
beginning of the
stadium
this is
got very confused
they thought that
you can concentrate
on these periodic
orbits
Barry, Heller
and Rubick
and I
went against
the grain
people think
we just made
this obvious
conjecture
actually nobody
believed us
at the beginning
I remember
they're all saying
you're wrong
we can prove
that
I was thinking
that you were
trying to actually
show that this
is right
examples
that you
right
they're these
exactly
these lifts
that were
to me
the obvious
candidates
for counter
examples
and then I was
able to prove
to you
for those exact
ones
and we began
to understand
it's true
because
above plane
alone's theorem
follows from
the Riemann
that part
we had no doubt
about it
but you didn't
prove anything
for higher dimension
in my sense
no
in a minute
you have something
that's mixed
but you can
the kind of
another
semi-bunimovic
stadium
you could also
see
in a closed
surface
which has
which is
somehow
in a
smooth way
you glue
a
cylinder
to some
he's saying
you could make
it in three dimensions
you could make it
in three dimensions
but his methods
will not work
there
but probably
just account of
this
hassle
message
still
two-dimensional
yeah but
the hassle thing
is
everybody
you just gave a
proof
everybody was aware
that
you do numerics
these bounce
they call
bouncing ball
mugs
and you have
you constant
there
so
there is
there's a
thin
sub-sequence
which
concentrates
on these
bouncing balls
but with numeric
there must be
instabilities
because
if you make
a little
violation
of symmetry
then it will
become
orgogic
the stadiums
are good
so
when he drew
the graphs
mcdonald
and later
heller
they saw
these
you go back
to the very
first picture
we're back
on picture
works
so
I have
personal interest
in quantum
organicity
because I
filmed something
like that
in my
work
which I reported
here
no no no
uh
the stadium
yes
we don't go
back there
yeah so
there
no go
back
yeah that way
yeah
heller had the
examples where
you had much
more pronounced
you can see
there's a
periodic orbit
yeah that's
enhanced
higher density
yeah it's got a
higher density
there and so
he was
seeking these
and that was
surprising to him
and this became
known as scars
and whether scars
persist in the
limit was
he claimed he
could prove
and numerically
he was claiming
he was seeing them
but once we
started to question
it
they changed
their mind
quickly
it became
something called
mesoscopic
whatever that
means
so let me get
it straight
the stadium
is not
uniformly
covered
even in
the limit
of fire
egg
and
right
the stadium
has these
bouncing ball
things
but other
than the
bouncing ball
things
it's possible
that everything
else
distributes
but the whole
point here
is to take
something
genuinely
chaotic
in every sense
with no
one parameter
family of
closed orbits
and then
it seems like
in the quantum
level
you don't see
the periodic orbits
periodic orbits
are gone
completely gone
in in the
semi-classical
limit
which is
which is
what i think
semi-classical
approximation
is wrong
exactly
that's interesting
yeah that is
interesting
yeah
yeah
when are you
leaving
when you're
leaving
um
i mean
i'm
flying to
Israel
in uh
tomorrow
basically
but i come
back anyway
are you here
tomorrow
that's
general
oh no
tomorrow
oh yeah
i'll leave it
into that
making a part
