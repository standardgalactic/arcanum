The feeling you get about him and many, many other scientists is that they really don't want to talk to philosophers.
They don't.
And that's because they learned early on that there are certain questions that you just don't want to address.
Like, if you ask Leonard Susskind, look, the fundamental equations of physics, dynamics of physics,
they're temporally symmetric, aren't they, Leonard?
And he'd say, yeah.
But look, we look around the world.
We never see people coming out of their graves and growing younger.
We never see ice cubes forming out of warm water.
Our world is all full of temporal asymmetries.
What grounds that?
Where does that come from?
But physicists don't really like to get into this very much or really delve into it in a way that really gets at the bottom of it.
I've done a few introductory kind of pedagogically oriented philosophy episodes with some of our friends like David Albert and Tim.
And I was really looking forward to, am really looking forward to doing one on the philosophy of science with you.
But first, something I always find funny is that when I tell non-philosophers that I'm interested in philosophy of math or philosophy of physics,
they always give me this incredulous stare because they know what math and physics are,
but they had no idea there was such a thing as philosophy of math or philosophy of physics.
And I have the sense it's the same for philosophy of science.
So I want to start just by asking you what science is, what philosophy of science is,
and how they're different, how they overlap.
It's a really interesting question.
Because, of course, there are many, many activities that people engage in, art, music, mathematics, physics.
And philosophers come along and they make philosophies of these things.
And you wonder, what are they doing making philosophies of these things?
So philosophers sort of ask foundational questions.
In the case of science, the question is, well, what is science anyway?
I mean, scientists don't investigate the question, what is science?
They do things like find out, you know, what mycochondria are, something like that,
or what are the amino acids there are.
But they don't investigate what is the nature of science.
Investigating the nature of science, well, that's something that can be done by different fields.
Sociologists can be interested in it because it's a sociological thing.
Historians can be interested in it because of the history of science.
But philosophers can be interested in it as a kind of, the idea of,
philosophers are particularly interested in normative kind of questions.
What are scientists aiming to do?
What are scientists after?
So philosophy of science is characterizing what science is in general.
And then a lot of subsidiary questions develop within science.
So science, within science, ideas have developed over the history of science.
For example, the one that I'm most interested in is the idea of the law of nature.
Now, the idea that there are laws really wasn't part of the way people thought about things
until sometime in the 17th century.
I don't mean there wasn't anything like it before, but there was.
The Greeks and the Romans and Chinese and Indians had some idea like that.
But the idea that there are mathematical principles to describe how things move,
how planets, pendula, projectiles, and so on move,
that only really took root in the 17th century.
The central figures, of course, are Galileo, Descartes, Newton.
And so the question is, what is a law of nature?
That's a philosophical question.
Scientists will go and tell you what laws of nature there are,
but they won't tell you what laws of nature are.
In fact, can I go on a little bit more?
Yeah, please.
I mean, the way I got into philosophy,
when I was an undergraduate at Amherst College,
longer ago than I care to reveal right now,
I was taking a course in physics and a course in statistics and a course in biology,
and the notion of probability, concept of probability came up in all those courses.
And they didn't seem to be talking about exactly the same thing in each of these courses.
They kept asking, what is that?
What is probability?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
And so finally, I think it was the guy in the physics department said,
go to the philosophy department.
So I went to the philosophy department,
and that's how I ended up majoring in philosophy.
And so I've spent most of my career trying to come up with an answer to that question
and related questions.
What exactly is the nature of objective probability and subjective probability and so on?
Maybe we want to talk about that later.
It's funny, as soon as I asked you the question,
what is science, what is philosophy of science,
I realized that asking what is science is itself,
or it can be itself, a philosophical question.
And I'm wondering then if you think it might be fair at all
to think of philosophy of science as meta-science in some way,
like an abstraction from science,
and what philosophy of science might have in common
or how it might be dissimilar from...
Well, the methods of philosophers of science
can overlap with the methods of science.
So I, in fact, think that the way philosophy of science should be pursued
is sort of seamlessly with science.
And that I'm in a tradition that follows, I guess,
the great American philosopher of science, in my view, is Willard Quine.
So philosophers of science are interested in giving explanations
at the most foundational and general level
using something like methods of theoretical science,
inference to the best explanation, things like that.
But philosophy of science is not an empirical...
It's not...
You don't do experiments in philosophy of science.
There are philosophers who are interested in doing
so-called experimental philosophy,
but that's a whole other can of worms, so to speak,
or a can of something which you don't want to open.
But so it's not the same as doing science.
I know, because I also was going to, at one point,
be a biochemist in my life, so I practiced some science.
I even published a couple of things in biochemistry.
There's an unknown fact, don't you think?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought I had your timeline all figured out.
So I have some idea.
I mean, I wouldn't really say I am a scientist
or could do science now,
but I have an idea about what goes on, really.
And of course, I've studied physics,
so I know what goes on in physics,
but not as an experimentalist.
If you were to put me into a laboratory,
you would want to get me out of there
as soon as you can.
Yeah, you kind of have a mad scientist look,
especially with the sunglasses right now.
I'm not angry at anybody, actually.
Maybe a happy mad scientist.
Well, I think it would be nice to start
with some of the classical questions
in the philosophy of science.
One of the major ones that comes to mind
is, I guess I've already asked this,
what is science?
But more particularly,
how do you contrast science with pseudoscience
and how has this been done historically?
Yeah, so that's really interesting.
I'm not sure that I have anything
so incisive to say about it.
I've been interested in it.
I've even taught a course
on science and pseudoscience.
So, of course, there's a lot.
Science has a lot of prestige, allegedly.
At least they get the grants.
So there are people who want to do science
but don't know the first thing
about doing science.
They invent something
that they want to get the money for
or at least want to get the prestige for.
And it's really pseudo
and it's not the real thing.
Let's think.
What's a really good example of a pseudo?
Of pseudoscience?
Pseudoscience.
Well, the obvious examples,
I mean, I was thinking of Popper
when I asked this question.
I had in mind astrology, perhaps.
Or, I mean, for Popper,
I understand psychoanalysis or Marxism
might have also counted as pseudoscience.
But maybe we ought to stick with astrology.
Astrology is a straightforward example.
I mean, I have known astrologers.
A very good friend of mine.
Someone, can I put it a little aside?
You can edit, right?
Yeah, I can edit, but I just want you to know.
You know George Ray?
Have you done George Ray?
Pretty much every time
you're going to tell me to cut something out,
I know it's going to be funny.
So I'm going to...
No, this is not going to be funny.
You know George Ray?
No, no, no.
He's somebody you should do.
His stepfather was an astrologer,
a pretty well-known astrologer.
Okay, well-known astrologer.
I'm not up on the greatest...
George Ray is a philosopher,
a very prominent philosopher of psychology
and philosopher of mind.
He's a little bit sick right now,
so I don't know if you can get him
to do anything good.
So let's see.
So astrologers claim that by examining
where the positions of the planets
and the stars were at various times
when you were born
or when you had your bar mitzvah
or something like that,
that they can tell you things
about your personality, your nature,
who you want to marry,
and things like that.
Now, these claims are wild.
There's no real understanding,
real theoretical backing
for why this should be the case.
Why should, when you were born,
have anything to do
with what your personality is about,
where the planets were doing?
The planets don't affect
your personality in that way.
Furthermore, if you subject claims
made by astrologers,
if they make really clear claims,
often they don't make clear claims,
the claims are vague
so that they can be,
they can say they really didn't get it wrong
because they didn't really mean that
or something like that.
But to the extent they can be pinned down,
they just don't pass the test.
So one of the things about science
is that scientists try to put forward,
or they should try to put forward,
clear hypotheses.
I mean, this is a good thing about Popper.
Popper emphasized this,
that scientists should put forward
clear hypotheses
which have clear predictions
and then subject them to severe tests.
I think that's the good part about Popper.
He just went overboard with that.
Well, maybe we should talk a bit more
about Popper
just because he's crucial
to most introduction
to the philosophy of science courses.
Maybe falsification
and its role in his philosophy of science
might be something worth covering.
Okay, okay.
So let's see.
I'll try not to be too glib about this.
When I first started teaching,
I had a colleague
who was a Popperian student
and in the department
that I was teaching,
then I got to be known
as the Popper Stopper.
The Popper Stopper.
I like that.
Because I think Popper
went just too far.
He's very,
he oversimplifies
many, many, many things
in my view.
On the other hand,
I think he was very good.
It was a good event
that he was there
and it happened
and he was clear about things.
I think it was a very good thing
that he was there.
So Popper was famous
for putting forward
a view called falsificationism,
the idea that scientists
should put forward
theories
or claims about the world
and then attempt
to falsify them
and that you could never
confirm a hypothesis
according to Popper
or some parts of Popper.
He modified this
at certain points.
So you should never say
you have good reason
to think that this is
closer to the truth
than that.
Well, he did try
to develop a conception
of closer to the truth,
actually,
which was one
of the interesting projects
that you might do
in philosophy of science.
and this was
a very, very influential idea.
I mean, it's actually
very important.
It influenced,
one place we might want
to follow up,
it influenced a whole way
or it's very much connected
to a whole part
of the way statistics is done
and statistics is very important
in doing science
and I don't know
if you want to get
into this later,
but now there's something
going on called
the statistics war.
So it's been going on
for a while
but the wars have been
starting up again
apparently from some emails
I've gotten recently.
Oh yeah.
Well, probability
is certainly on my list
for a topic
that we need to get to,
especially in conjunction
with something
you've already mentioned
which is laws of nature,
but you're right
that I would like
to hold off on that
for a little while.
Okay, about Popper
and this,
so I was very much
brought up
at the graduate school
I went to,
one that you know
about well
at Stanford.
One of my teachers
was Patrick Soupy
so I'm sure
he has a big influence
he might have been
gone for a while.
as a Bayesian
I learned about
the approach
to understanding
scientific inference
via something
called Bayes' theorem.
Now that also
can be oversimplified
a lot
and maybe we want
to talk about that
a little bit more
later on
but when I first
started doing
philosophy of science
at the department
I was at then
it was sort of
Bayesians
versus Popperians.
I'm not sure
this is even the way
anybody would think
about things nowadays
but in fact
I edited an edition
of Synthes
I think called
it was the very first
thing I did I think
in philosophy
Bayesians versus
Popperians
and basically
Bayesians thought
of scientific inference
as people
scientists
sought out
with certain degrees
of belief
or amounts
of confidence
in various hypotheses
they then do
experiments
they get evidence
and they update
their degrees
of belief
in accordance
with certain rules
which seem to follow
from principles
of rationality
which we can talk
about why they
make sense.
Popperians really
didn't like this
and so that was
what the fight
was over
in those days
and in fact
in statistics
the two approaches
to statistics
the broad approaches
to statistics
I'm oversimplifying
are so-called
orthodox
or significance
testing on the one
hand
and Bayesian
on the other
hand
and really
that's kind
of like
a following
of the dispute
between Bayesians
and Popperians
and philosophy
of science.
Before we move
on from
Popper
there are two
specific things
I'd like to get
your takes on
even though
they might not
fall under
the philosophy
of science
one is
with regard
to falsification
you probably
know
I've done
a number
of episodes
on string
theory
with some
very famous
string theorists
like Leonard
Susskind
or
Juan Maldicena
and one
of the
major criticisms
of string
theory
which for
our listeners
who might not
be familiar
with string
theory
in a nutshell
though it's
obviously much
much more
complicated than
this string
theory
reimagines
the point
particles
and fields
of quantum
field theory
as tiny
one dimensional
oscillating
strings
along with
some other
sort of
fundamentalia
but what
people allege
is that
it's unfalsifiable
in part
because there
are currently
no conceivable
experiments
that could be
run to test it
and what I
am wondering
is whether
or not
you think
a la Popper
that this
should preclude
us from
viewing string
theory as
science
so
the two
reasons
that something
might be
unfalsifiable
one is
that it's
the theory
itself
is so
developed
so that
no conceivable
experiment
thanks for
qualifying my
word conceivable
I mean
you used it
much better
than I did
I should have
said no
practical
experiment
can be done
no conceivable
experiment
could falsify
it
if that is
really the
case
then it's
not science
but if there's
no experiment
that could be
done now
that can't
falsify it
that doesn't
mean that
if you work
on the theory
and you develop
things
you develop
new technology
and so on
you couldn't
falsify it
there are all
sorts of
hypotheses
in cosmology
that can't
be falsified
now
but are very
interesting
and important
and people
there were
ones at times
which couldn't
be falsified
and later
weren't able
to be falsified
or I'm not sure
verified is the
right word
but there are
past tests
falsification tests
so that's a very
important distinction
as far as I
understand
I'm no expert
in string theory
I understand it
to an extent
but no expert
in it
far from it
there's a problem
within the
foundations of
physics
that's super
super important
and that is
that
the two
basic fundamental
theories
really one
really really
fundamental theory
and that's
quantum field theory
and then there's
an account of
space-time
that's
general relativity
and it's
basically
the theory
within
cosmology
is mostly
done
and
stuff
in astronomy
where
strong
gravitational
fields are
involved
but it's
definitely
the structure
of space
done
but these
theories
do not
fit together
very well
as is a
question of
how to
make them
compatible
with each
other
and there
are a number
of ideas
floating around
have you done
Carlo Rovelli
actually?
I'd love to
speak with
Carlo
but
Carlo's
going to be
around
starting in
October
oh really
giving a bunch
of lectures
at Princeton
right
so
so here's
an approach
not string
theory
but a different
kind of approach
and a number
of other ideas
that are around
and I think
at this point
yeah this is
such a tough
difficult
interesting
problem
let people
think about
it
I mean
it would be
ridiculous
for someone
to say
stop thinking
about it
because you
can't falsify
it now
and if
there are
people who
say that
screw them
yeah I'm
entirely
inclined to
agree with
you on this
point
even if
there might
be other
good criticisms
of string
theory
I don't think
falsification
is the way
to go
the other
thing I wanted
to ask you
about
just because
out of
intellectual interest
I've done a
number of
episodes
on the
show
about
Marxism
and since
Marxism
is one
of Karl
Popper's
pet peeves
this again
isn't necessarily
related to the
philosophy of
science but
as a philosopher
as a philosopher
of science
how do you feel
about Marxism
I'm afraid I have
a lot to say
about that
the first thing
that comes to
mind
is a philosopher
whom I knew
personally
and when you
talk to David
Albert
David knew him
much better
than me actually
but is one
of the most
important figures
in the history
of contemporary
philosophy
he's published
almost nothing
this is Sidney
Morgan Besser
I'm sure you've
heard about him
absolutely
and when Marx
comes up
Morgan Besser's
famous remark
about Marx
comes to mind
which is that
up until now
people have
studied Marx
the time
has come
to change him
I've heard
Morgan Besser
had a lot
of really good
lines
many many
many many
many many
many
too bad
he's not
around for you
to interview
he'd be the best
I ever knew
about
he used to
call me up
once in a while
I didn't know
that person
when I mentioned
before I got
into philosophy
when I was
in Amherst
the teacher
I had
who was a philosopher
a guy you probably
never heard of
Joe Epstein
who actually
was a friend
of Pat Soupy's
incidentally
one of the things
about philosophy
is you get to know
a lot of great
people in philosophy
really interesting
people
I'm sure you've
noticed this
because you've
gone out of your
way to get to
know them
I never had
any idea
when I was
a little student
at Amherst College
that I'd get
into such a
fantastic field
and get to know
so many interesting
people
so Epstein
was my teacher
there
was also a
co-student
with Sidney
Morgan Besser
who was a
co-student
with Pat Soupy's
too I don't know
if you knew that
or not
Columbia
so I didn't know
Morgan Besser
early on
I got to know
him when I
moved back to
New York
and David
knew him a little
bit
and I got to
know him through
David
and Morgan Besser
knew that I was a
guy he could call
up
and bend my ear
on the phone
so he'd call me
up from time to
time
and every once in
a while my wife
would say
Barry's not here
because she knew
she knew I'd be
on the phone
for an hour
anyway
so Morgan Besser
said a lot of
great statements
ask David about
more
we could spend
the hour
just talking about
yeah
let's get back
to Marxism
and you don't
have to say
all you have
to say on it
but I love your
thoughts
my wife
who I just
mentioned now
she's from
Budapest
her family
were communists
at one point
parts of her
family were
they were also
Holocaust survivors
I mean it's a long
story you don't
go into that
but they also
became anti-communists
and so she was
brought up
she was born
after 56
but she was
her uncle
was one of the
leaders of the
56 rebellion
he had to leave
Hungary
lives in Paris
now he's still
alive in 98
and so she
was brought up
on sort of
the Soviet
style thing
until the
early 1980s
when communism
fell
so she really
hates that
stuff
and she was
brought up
she went to
Karl Marx
University
and when we
went
when I visited
her
when I first
got to know
her
and I went
and we sort
of fell for
each other
there
she took me
to Karl Marx
University
and there
was a bust
of Karl Marx
in the middle
of there
and of course
knowing me
what do you
think I did
I separated
it from
where it was
and I turned
it upside down
and put him
on his head
that is a very
very thing to do
okay that tells
me all I need
to know
I don't know
really what
Karl Popper
has to say
about Marx
I know he
dumped on it
a lot
because that
was what
was in the
air
when he
was
writing
I think
now
you know
that's
in the past
I think Marx
had many
interesting things
that should
be studied
and thought
about more
seriously
now
one last
quite general
question
about science
and the
philosophy
of the same
is scientific
realism
what is
this debate
of scientific
realism
so
there's a
debate within
philosophy
of realism
versus
idealism
or various
other things
that are
modifications
of realism
for a while
Hillary Putnam
held something
called internal
realism
or
weak-kneed
realism
or something
like that
and then
there's a
debate between
scientific realism
and
or something
called constructive
empiricism
and scientific
realism
full-throated
scientific
realism
say
what scientists
are aiming at
is to finding out
what the world
is really like
I don't know
why you'd want
to be a scientist
unless that's
what you wanted
to do
unless you wanted
to be one of the
tech guys in Palo Alto
and you just wanted
to get rich
then you might want
to be a scientist
so I think if you're
interested in science
you want to know
what is the world
really like
and the next question
is
can you actually
find out what the world
is really like
well I think
that if you look
at the history
of science
it's reasonable
to say
that scientists
have found out
what the world
is really like
or close to really like
to a large extent
for example
at one point
it was not really clear
that the world
was made up
out of little things
which lots of degrees
of freedom
you know
got to be called atoms
now elementary particles
or something like that
I now think
that it's
definitely
that's the case
in some sense
have made up out of
I mean maybe that
that's not at the very
bottom of the
of the story
but there definitely
are atoms
and molecules
I've even seen
molecules in a
in a microscope
so not that
that's the test
but
so I think
we found out
more about
what the world
was really like
we found out
that the earth
really moves
that the moon
moves around the earth
that the earth
moves around the sun
so scientists
have found out
what the world
is really like
so scientific
realists think
that the scientists
can
it should aim
to do that
and can succeed
to a extent
whether it could
succeed
entirely
that's an open question
so called
constructive empiricists
and the famous name
there was a very
important
significant figure
Bas van Frassen
who I've spoken with
on the show
yeah
he's great
significant
he for a while
held
I don't know
where he is
right now
about this
but
I haven't seen him
in 10 years
or so
and
he
held that
all science
should aim to do
is to find out
what you would see
if you were to do
experiments
of various kinds
and I think
science should aim
for that
but the reason
you should aim
for that
is you should
find out
what the world
is really like
and finding out
what you see
when you do
experiments
of various kinds
tells you something
about what the world
is really like
so
are you a scientific
realist
do you believe
that
science can tell us
what the world
is really like
yeah
what is the
best argument
that you've heard
for
us not being able
to believe
that science
can in principle
tell us
what the world
is really like
maybe in particular
about
unobservable entities
like
water molecules
or strings
or something like that
we can never get
to the bottom of it
well
this is an idea
that you should only
believe in what
you can see
now I'm very
nearsighted
so this would be
very limited to me
yeah
okay
I assure you
I exist
okay
I'm often
unsure about myself
but
glad to hear
that you exist
so
yeah
so
but I think
that's ridiculous
we can also believe
in things we hear about
and you know
I mean
just
when you understand
what it is to be
a human being
we know
that we couldn't even
believe in what we see
unless we believed
about a lot of other
things too
okay
because we can only
see the front sides
of things
we believe that things
have back sides too
okay
okay
and they
so
I think
and the whole
and one of the
you know
in the 50s
and 60s
there was a whole
discussion about
whether they can be
there's a sharp
distinction
between what's
observable
and what's not
observable
I think there isn't
a sharp distinction
between them
and the notions
are not that
clear
and they're really
notions that should
go into
psychology
they should be
studied by psychologists
not
any of them
so
I
I think the idea
that you should only
believe what you can see
is a really bad argument
for not being
a scientific realist
the argument for not
being scientific realist
which has a little bit
of
strength I think
is that scientists
have often made mistakes
is this the
argument about
the pessimistic
meta-induction
yeah
could you explain
what that is
and what those words are
I think that
that might be
interesting for our listeners
I wish I had a good line
to say about a pessimist
and optimist
but I think a little bit
something will come to mind
but
Norman Finkelstein
yesterday said
something interesting
about
Noam Chomsky
which kind of relates
not really
but he said that
Norman
that Chomsky
was not
a glass
half empty
or half full
kind of guy
he was just
the glass is empty
I thought that was funny
oh
I see
I've met people
who said
where's the glass
oh that's a good one too
oh yeah
the pessimistic
meta-induction
what is it
what does meta-induction mean
okay
okay
so the idea is
you're doing an induction
just an induction
what's an induction
okay
an induction
is you got some evidence
you do some conclusion
for the evidence
the conclusion doesn't follow
with logic validity
from the evidence
but you
but you somehow think
that the evidence
provides reason
to believe the conclusion
now when induction
is good
and when it's bad
that is one of the most
fundamental and important
questions in philosophy
and philosophy of science
we can come back to that
that's really
Hume's problem
and Goodman's paradox
fascinating and interesting
things for discussion
I don't know
if we want to get into that
or not
but I'm quite interested
in both those things
so that's what an induction is
it's pessimistic
because with respect
to scientific realism
you should think
that the evidence
we have
is that scientists
have come up
with lots of proposals
for what the world is like
and later
it's shown that
they're wrong
so maybe anything
we come up with
the conclusion
that the induction
is supposed to lead to
is anything scientists
ever come up with
is going to be wrong
but I think
that's a completely
mistaken inference here
first of all
the things that you come up with
why they're shown to be wrong
they're shown to be wrong
in places
but right for the most part
so for example
the early quantum theory
was wrong
but it had a big part
that was right
that led
to better quantum theory
Newton's
to make the most famous example
Newton's classical mechanics
isn't right
but
Newton said
that he was standing
on the shoulders
of others
so he could see further
now I don't know
that anybody
would have the gall
to say that
standing on Newton's shoulders
those shoulders
are too high up
to get to
yeah
okay
but
certainly in some sense
the one person
who could say that
would be Albert Einstein
and he certainly
was doing that
okay
so
while Newton was wrong
he was on the right track
so Popper noticed this too
you know Popper earlier
and he wanted to go
with the ideas that
well
theories that people
have come up
and have been falsified
maybe they were
approximately true
and he tried to come up
with an account
of when
a theory
or
it doesn't have to be
anything as fancy
as a theory
just
a claim
a view
is not true
but it's close
to being true
that's a really
interesting idea
Popper used the word
verisimilitude for that
there have been attempts
to come up with
more precise
and formal accounts
of verisimilitude
some of them
are better than others
I'm not sure
I'm really on top
of that literature
right now
but that's an interesting
project
because we certainly
have an idea
of when
you know
we certainly think
that if we watch
two debaters
that we think
both of them
are saying a lot
of false things
I won't name names
because we're not
on a political
discussion now
but in a recent
debate
I would say
one of them
was a lot further
from the truth
than the other one
yeah
I have the sense
maybe we've spoken
about it before
that you
knew Hillary Putnam
who was another
big titan
in 20th century
philosophy
and another
titan who is
quite connected
to this debate
about scientific
realism
and you know
what I'm going
to ask you
I'm going to ask
you
I mean the
pessimistic
meta-induction
is an important
argument
for the
scientific
anti-realist
but another
argument
this one
that is in
favor of
the scientific
realist
is the
no miracles
argument
and that
is attributed
to Hillary Putnam
so I wanted
to ask you
about that one
yeah
okay
and afterwards
if you want
I can tell you
a story
about Hillary
Putnam
you don't
want to do
it on the air
well you can
it can be
on the air
because almost
nobody knows
the story
I'm going to
tell you
okay
and since
I'm going
to retire
soon
that I'm
left knowing
that this
story
almost no one
knows this
story
okay
for our
listeners
Hillary Putnam
really is
one of the
huge
titans
he is
one of the
great
philosophers
he somehow
the great
philosophers
now
are thought
to be
I believe
Saul Kripke
David Lewis
and Willard
Quine
maybe there's
some other
names you
want to
throw in
Wilfred Sellers
and Putnam
is up there
but I think
Putnam should
be right up
there with
those
at the very
top
in my own
view
and Sellers
should be
too
the problem
with Putnam
is
he changed
his mind
often about
things
and said
he did
he was
very very
strong
some of
the things
he wrote
about
certain areas
like in
quantum mechanics
he was a
little bit
screwed up
about
David
you know
I don't know
if you know
this
but David
was his
source
in quantum
mechanics
so
scientists
have come up
with theories
they look like
they're right
their experimental
results are right
I mean
take some
examples
genetics
is an
example of
that
when it first
came up
people
didn't know
anything about
genes
when Mendel
was coming up
with his
account
of
inheritance
nobody knew
what DNA was
or anything like that
it took a while
for people to develop
that
it would be a miracle
to think that
someone could come up
with this theory
and for it to work out
the way it did
if it weren't
on the right track
okay
that's the
no miracles
argument
and surely
Putnam
is right
about that
Putnam
was a
scientific
realist
but he was
not a
full-blown
philosophical
realist
that's
maybe for a
metaphysics
discussion
not for
now
here's a
story about
Putnam
so I
didn't
I wasn't
a student
of Putnam's
and I
only really
I knew him
a little bit
before
but I only
really got to
know him
because I
spent a
summer
at a
summer
seminar
that he
ran
in 1986
or 7
or 8
I don't
remember
exactly
the year
and
I got to
know him
quite well
in the
summer
seminar
and we
hung out
a lot
and I
learned a
lot
from him
I really
think
I absorbed
my
philosophical
views
as much
from him
as from
anybody
although I
didn't
realize it
at the
time
so here's
the story
it's a story
about how I
almost killed
Hillary Putnam
oh my god
like I said
you may not
want to
you want to
maybe want to
edit it out
of this
so in
Boston Harbor
I got into
the habit
you can rent
these boats
I used to go
kayaking
in my youth
and now I
don't sure
I couldn't
do it
a little bit
but you can
rent these
boats
which are
kind of
like kayaks
I think
they're called
wearies
they're much
bigger
this is starting
to sound
like an
attempted murder
in Boston
Harbor
late at night
I wasn't
attempted murder
I guarantee you
it wasn't
nothing intentional
is the statute
of limitations
up on this
he's dead
anyway
but I didn't
want to kill him
I think he was
a great human
being actually
you know
to the extent
I knew him
I mean
I wouldn't say
I know
him really
really personally
but I knew
him from
this thing
and so
I told him
about this
that I was
going in
and he said
he wanted
to go out
on a weary
because he
hadn't done
this
in one of
these boats
so I took
him out
on the boat
we went
on the boat
you rented
them
in the harbor
you rented
them
we were going
out a little
ways
and he decided
to stand up
but you can't
stand up
in a weary
because what
happens if you
stand up
tips
tips
capsizes
so he fell
into the
Boston Harbor
I had to
fish him out
of the Boston Harbor
if I didn't
fish him out
he wouldn't have
made it
it's a good
thing that you
were there
and you didn't
have ill will
for Hillary
Putnam
so that's
the story
the last thing
since we've
already talked
a bit about
string theory
which I find
quite fascinating
I know that
a lot of
philosophers
don't think
the time is
right yet
to be doing
philosophy of
string theory
or they think
the time has
passed because
string theory is
dead and
we shouldn't
really be doing
philosophy of
string theory
at all
but there
is a relevant
question related
to scientific
realism
so I've spoken
with Tim
Modlin
plenty of times
on the show
he says
we're not
getting rid
of H2O
one way or
another
no matter
what happens
with science
it's almost
impossible
that water
as H2O
is going
anywhere
but he
certainly
wouldn't say
the same
thing about
strings
he would
he would
say
either
he's
very certain
the world
is not
composed
of strings
or stringy
things
or
if anything
it is very
far from
certain
that the world
is composed
of stringy
things
I'm wondering
if there is
a criterion
or some
set of
criteria
that
you as a
philosopher of
science
or philosophers
of science
in general
would use
to make
this distinction
of when
we want
to accept
an
unobservable
entity
or class
of entities
accepting
the caveat
that unobservable
is maybe
a nebulous
term
into our
ontology
of what
the world
is like
I wouldn't
look for a
criterion
for such
a thing
it's just
sort of
gotta
be on the
ground
and see
what's going
on in the
field
I totally
agree with
Tim about
H2O
you know
if there's
not a
worldwide
drought
H2O
is here
to stay
okay
string theory
I just
think it's
not clear
enough
and I think
the reason
that philosophers
there aren't
very many
philosophers
thinking about
it
is because
it's hard
to learn
about it
I've
attempted
to read
some of
the work
in string
theory
Brian Green
is another
guy in
New York
I don't
know if
he does
interviews
or not
but he's
a string
theorist
guy
you know
I've heard
him talk
about it
I think
to get
into the
mathematics
of it
is a
mathematics
is very
very difficult
and fancy
that's why
philosophers
are not
doing it
I think
it's just
hard
there are
some
philosophers
who are
doing it
Jeremy
Butterfield
Sebastian
Dejaro
Nick
Huggett
your student
Craig
Callender
there are
a lot
of
another
topic
in the
philosophy
of science
worth
broaching
and mind
you
we're
going to
get to
natural
laws
to
probability
to
your
cup
of
tea
is
fundamentalia
and what
is fundamental
fundamental
entities
fundamental
theories
but maybe
this is a
good place
to ask
because
fundamentalia
also has
a metaphysical
ring to it
and there
are lots
of debates
within
metaphysics
about what
fundamentality
even is
if
it is
a
univocal
term
at all
what is
fundamentalia
but
sorry
first
how do
philosophy
of science
and metaphysics
interact
or connect
you're smiling
is that because
it's a good
question
it's a really
good question
okay
and it's
something
really central
question
so I think
people in
metaphysics
divide up
into those
who think
that metaphysics
is its own
subject
and
science
is you know
something there
but you do
metaphysics
based on
intuitions
and a history
of metaphysics
and maybe
theology
I don't know
something like
that
and there
are those
who think
that really
all metaphysics
is
is understanding
what the world
must be like
for science
to be a successful
enterprise
that's my view
now I might go
a little bit
further than that
because I think
there are other
enterprises
that people engage
in like art
and music
and you might wonder
what the world
must be like
or what human beings
must be like
really in those cases
more than the world
or reality
must be like
for those to be
successful enterprises
but science
especially
is
what must the world
be like for science
to be a successful
enterprise
so I think
metaphysics
is very closely
connected
to science
but there are
people who
disagree with that
for sure
and in the history
of metaphysics
you know
for sure
so there were
there were
I was just
talking to
a student of mine
the other day
about McTaggart
interesting guy
do you know McTaggart
at all
well I don't know him
but
no I didn't know
neither
but I did
study with a teacher
I'm not sure
she knew him
but we studied
McTaggart
because he was
the bad guy
in the course
again
this is just a story
I'm not going to
tell you the story
are you sure
I'm not going to
tell you it to you
yeah
you're interested
in what you do
I'll tell you
who the teacher was
because when I was
an undergraduate teacher
it was Alice Ambrose
do you know who she was
she
Alice Lazerowicz
Alice Ambrose
she was the person
who knew Wittgenstein
and transcribed
the Brown book
I took a great course
she taught at Smith College
then
a course
in which we read
Russell, Moore
and Wittgenstein
she knew Wittgenstein
personally
she knew all three
of those
well
that's pretty crazy
that I studied with her
is super crazy
and the five people
who took that course
all of them became
philosophers
in one way
or another
on their two degrees
removed now
from the Titans
that I had anything
I mean
I just recently taught
a history and analytic
philosophy course
and I began by telling
the students
that
I don't really
I don't really feel that
I don't feel that
I know enough
to really
really feel that
I'm not an expert
on that stuff at all
but
so anyway
so
McTaggart
McTaggart
thought he could go
and demonstrate
that time doesn't exist
with arguments
about the nature of time
or another philosopher
that at the time
not in this
somebody's still been studied
in this course
we read
sorry
I'm all over the place here
we read McTaggart
and Bradley
another example
he wanted to prove
that nothing existed
okay
we read them
to understand
why Russell and Moore
were reacting
against these guys
I found actually
Bradley and McTaggart
more interesting
than I found
Moore
who I thought
was a bore
Russell
I think
is one of the greats
and Wittgenstein
talked to some
Wittgenstein person
that's interesting
I don't know
where Wittgenstein
is now
there was just a
I know there was
just a conference
because a student of mine
came back from that
conference at Harvard
where Wittgenstein
is still held
in high esteem
about what's called
the future of Wittgenstein
that was the conference
he came back from
anyway
but McTaggart
and Bradley
who are the bad guys
they did metaphysics
in this old-fashioned way
they didn't bother
to study anything
about science
in order to do there
now some people
in the history
of historians
of science
like Kant
he knew something
about science
but he didn't really
studied science
or Hume
I actually
Hume certainly
knew something
but I actually
went to Hume scholar
recently to find out
what is known
about what Hume knew
about Newtonian mechanics
and it seems to be
not a clear answer
to that question
from what I could see
you may
I may be wrong
about this
and there may be
Hume scholars
who know better
about what to say
but Hume certainly
knew about it
it was all over England
did he really know
about
Newtonian mechanics
I think Lagrange's stuff
was already developed
in France
by the time
Hume was writing
I think
I'm not positive
about that
but Newtonian mechanics
was developed
so I don't know
so most philosophers
did not study
science carefully
in fact
even some of the greats
of the 20th century
like Quine
Quine did not
really study physics
very much
or David Lewis
who was a chemist
actually learned chemistry
and knew something
about quantum mechanics
and relativity
he wrote a little bit
of a relativity
wrote one paper
on quantum mechanics
but they're not
they were not
his main interests
now
you mentioned
Ted Sider
Ted has recently
gotten very interested
in the foundations
of physics
because he knows
that if he's going
to be a metaphysician
he's going to understand
physics to an extent
and I think that's
100% correct
that's something
that our friend
Tim says
and he said it
on the show
that if you want
to understand
the metaphysics
of our world
you need to look
at the physics
Tim wrote a book
called
The Metaphysics
Within Physics
now Tim and I
draw very different
conclusions
from what
metaphysics
you find
within physics
but that's
I think
that's a good
place to look
since you mentioned
McTaggart
the philosophy
of time
or just questions
about time
seem like
they might
constitute
a good
haste study
for helping us
distinguish a bit
between science
and metaphysics
interestingly
a lot of
scientists
that I speak
with about
philosophy
where philosophy
comes up
such as Leonard
Susskind
anything that
they don't like
they call
metaphysics
so they lump
in questions
about that
we might ask
about time
with astrology
or ghosts
or phantasms
so they have
for a philosopher
a non-standard
use of the word
metaphysics
but what
what sorts
of questions
about time
would constitute
scientific
questions
and what
kind
might constitute
metaphysical
questions
that's a really
good question
just parenthetically
I've never met
Leonard Susskind
personally
I gather you have
I've thought
sometime
when I was
at Stanford
thought about
finding his door
and knocking on it
if he has a door
still at Stanford
I could lead you
right to it
because I have
gone through
his lectures
his lectures
are great
but the feeling
you get about him
and this you might
find interesting
for what you're
asking about
the feeling
you get about him
and many many
other scientists
is that they really
don't want to talk
to philosophers
they don't
because philosophers
not all
scientists are like that
Sean Carroll
who you probably
have talked to
is a big exception
or I can think
of other scientists
like that
I mean
Shelley Goldstein
is another example
he's a mathematician
but he's
but there are others
who are not like that
but
and that's because
they learned early on
that there are certain
questions that
you just don't want
to address
like
if you ask
Leonard Susskind
look
the fundamental
equations of
physics
dynamics of physics
they're temporally
symmetric
aren't they
Leonard
he'd say
yeah
Schrodinger's equation
is temporally symmetric
and you might have
to specify a little bit
more
by that
so that
any sequence
of macroscopic
events that happen
in one temporal direction
that are compatible
to laws
they can happen
in the opposite
temporal directions
compatible to laws
so you'd have to say
yes
but look
we look around the world
we never see people
coming out of their graves
and growing younger
we never see
ice cubes
you know
forming out of warm water
our world is all full
of temporal
asymmetries
and of course
what grounds that
where does that come from
now there's the idea
and you'll talk to David
I'm sure about this
because he's the world
expert on this
that it somehow
is connected to statistical
mechanics in some way
that's right
but physicists
don't really like
to get into this
very much
or really delve
into it
in a way
that really
gets at the bottom
of it
as I think
and it's just
Susskind wouldn't
I'm not sure
he probably knows
more about this
than most
but
many wouldn't
or in quantum mechanics
is the
famous example
as I'm sure you know
as you talk to Tim
and David
and I think even me
a little bit about
is the famous
measurement problem
in quantum mechanics
well that's a problem
it was pointed out
by a physicist
originally
by Schrodinger
and Einstein
originally
physicists wanted
to sweep it
under the rug
and it took philosophers
to keep taking it out
from under the rug
and saying
we've got to think
about this
we've got to think
about this
and it really is
actually central
and important
to understanding
what quantum mechanics
is about
so here
there's a
a smooth connection
between physics
and philosophy
of physics
where the philosophers
of physics
were doing
what the physicists
should have been doing
really in my view
a few minutes ago
you used the phrase
fundamental equations
and that brings us back
to fundamentalia
what does a philosopher
of science
have to say
about fundamentalia
what sorts of things
might a philosopher
of science
discuss
regarding
fundamentalia
theories
equation
and entities
let's talk about
let's talk about
entities in first
and a little bit
about history
please
from the very beginning
from the Greeks
there was the idea
and it's a very
common idea
that you explain
complicated things
in terms of
their parts
simpler things
in some sense
of parts
so you know
it's the idea
the earth
is made up
out of earth
or the world
is made up
of earth air
water and fire
or atoms
or everything
is water
is that what
Thales said
everything is water
I think it was
made of a misprint
he said
it said
after my daughter
I never really
understood what
that was about
but anyhow
I heard that he
fell into a well
fell into a well
that's what it was
everything is water
that's right
that's the story
anyhow
so
so that's a
that's an idea
and it's a
it's a very
attractive idea
that the world
is made up
out of
reality is made up
out of
fundamental parts
it's an idea
in science
now
my idea
if we get into
my ideas about
metaphysics
I'm going to put
them off for a while
my ideas about
metaphysics are a little
more subtle
and more complicated
than that
but the idea in
science is certainly
there
that we want
something at the
bottom
in terms of which
we can explain
other things
so we start out
with something
that's
we might call
basic or fundamental
at least for a while
we may find something
more fundamental
than that
we start out with
something that's
we think of as
fundamental
maybe they're atoms
and maybe atoms
are made up
out of electrons
and protons
and electrons
and protons
are put together
in certain ways
you get atoms
in certain signs
and atoms
are put together
in various ways
according to
certain laws
of physics
we can get
molecules of various
kinds
which explains
why they can be
water
why they can be
acids
why they can be
bases
and so on
and so on
like that
and these
explanatory frameworks
work beautifully
I think
so that's the idea
okay
of why this
is fundamental
now
as far as
laws are concerned
of course
there
when you have
fundamental things
you only can
explain what
they're doing
if you have
certain principles
or regularities
that they
conform to
these are thought
to be the laws
about them
we haven't talked
about what laws are
we can come to that
in a while
but there's certain
regularities about them
these would be the
fundamental laws
about the fundamental
things
when you get more
complicated things
there'll be
non-fundamental laws
or sometimes called
special science laws
and there's a question
about how
the non-fundamental
and the fundamental
are related to
that's a kind of
metaphysical
or scientific
metaphysical question
also a very important
question in the
philosophy of science
I'm glad you bring up
the special sciences
because one of the
other topics I wanted
to talk about
and now maybe
is a good time
is the reduction
of the special sciences
to well
the reduction
of some special sciences
or special science
in particular
biology
to chemistry
and then physics
and how this relates
to laws
and also to
fundamentalia
because there are
laws in biology
for instance
like scaling laws
that presumably
reduce to chemistry
and then to physics
and I'm wondering
how this works
and how you think
about reduction
and fundamentalia
in this context
so the whole business
about reduction
often brings people
up into fighting modes
really it's that
the reductionists
and the anti-reductionists
I think this is not
the right way
to look at things
exactly
somehow the
the anti-reductionists
think
gee if you're
a reductionist
all the money
will go to
the physics department
so no no
but that won't happen
because the biologists
are they actually
the ones
who are finding
cures for diseases
and better ways
to grow corn
and stuff like that
so that's not
going to happen anyway
look
either you think
that the world
is made up
out of fundamental
physical things
and that's all
the fundamental
things there are
or you think
in addition
to fundamental
physical things
they're fundamental
biological things
so the question
about life
that's one really
interesting thing
for a certain
time in the history
of science
it was thought
that there was
a certain
I don't know
a substance
or a fluid
or I don't know
and I know what
something called
Elon vital
that got sprinkled
onto certain
physical things
that made them alive
now I don't think
anybody thinks
anything like that
now
of course
there's some people
who think
that there was
somehow
there was just dust
and then it took
a deity
to wave a wand
or whatever deities
do
to make the thing
to be alive
there may be people
who think that
now
too
I don't really
know about that
but I don't think
that
okay
but people do
think this
about consciousness
now for sure
you know
Dave Chalmers
is an example
of someone
who's argued
you know
strongly
that given
all the
fundamental
physical stuff
in the world
is
that's not sufficient
to account for
why there's
consciousness
in the world too
so when the world
was made
all the fundamental
physical things
had to be put in place
then also consciousness
had to be added
to the world
now I don't think that
so I'm a reductionist
to the extent
that I think
all there is
is the fundamental
physical stuff
there are some people
who think
that no
this is
some people who
Nancy Cartwright
is a good example
of someone who thinks
this is just taking
stuff way too far
they think there's
a lot of different
stuff in the world
at different levels
and that the whole idea
of building up the world
out of fundamental
physical stuff
parenthetically
have you spoken
to Nancy Cartwright
no
but we might
at some point
she's a fascinating
person
I don't know her
very well
but I'm not going
to tell the story
I know about her
okay you're not
darn
but I think
her work is very
interesting for sure
but she'd be
on the opposite
side of this
from me
and you know
she wrote at times
things like
the world is
variegated
it's a mess
it occurs to me
now
that reductionists
like me
tend to be people
who in their offices
their offices
are a mess
my guess is
though I don't know
this that Nancy Cartwright
is a very neat person
and her philosophical
views is that
the world is a mess
you mentioned
David Chalmers
and consciousness
a moment ago
and consciousness
might not fall
under the typical
umbrella of
philosophy of science
because it
falls under
typically the
philosophy of mind
but
since we've been
talking about
metaphysics
there are some
metaphysicians
who take a very
robust view
of metaphysics
that have
interesting views
about consciousness
and I'm wondering
just since it's
come up
what your views
are on consciousness
given that you're
a particularly
science-minded
philosopher
I'm not expecting
your theory of
consciousness
but maybe
how you view
well you might not
know this
because it never
came up
but my wife
is actually an
expert on this
subject
and she
has I think
written the paper
that refutes
Charmer's arguments
oh great
if you've ever
looked at it
and I was in
full review
some years ago
and she works
works on it
and has written
stuff and she's
writing a book
on this stuff
now
but anyway
so
and her teacher
was a person
who taught at
Rutgers
who was a colleague
of mine
named Brian Lohr
he died some years
ago sadly
but I think he had
the key idea
to show how to
defend physicalism
against the kind
of arguments
that Frank Jackson
and then David
Charmer's taking
Frank Jackson's
arguments
developed into
his dualist
views
and of course
this interacted
with philosophy
of science
and quantum mechanics
in a big way
because for a while
in the history
of quantum mechanics
people were making
claims like
consciousness collapses
the wave function
in fact Charmer's
just got into
a long conversation
with Charmer's
at dinner
a few nights ago
about
he has actually
developed a kind
of version
a sort of more
sophisticated
contemporary version
of consciousness
collapsing the wave
function
view
you've heard of
GRW probably
it's a spinoff
of GRW
so you can't
separate these
things
philosophy is all
over them
philosophy covers
everything
that's why
one goes into
philosophy
because you can't
keep your mouth
shut
have you noticed
that
yeah but
my question is
more about
how you
think
consciousness
needs to be
investigated
let me just
add another
thing
I buy my
wife's view
and Brian
Lord's view
I think
consciousness
is a physical
phenomena
I also think
that because
of the way
we encounter
our own
consciousness
we will never
come up
with what we
think of
as a satisfactory
explanation
of why
how it is
can be the
case
that neurons
doing whatever
neurons do
can result
in something
like
there's something
it's like
you know
to whatever
feel a tickle
in your nose
or a pain
in the butt
or whatever
what it's like
is supposed
to be
while we're
on the topic
of consciousness
which might
be a good
case study
to use that
phrase again
for this
and
fundamentalia
the word
emergence
comes up
often in
discussions
of physics
and it's
and metaphysics
and it's
a heated
and charged
word
people use it
in different
ways
what is
emergence
and what's
an emergent
theory
what's
perhaps
similar
in kind
an effective
theory
well as you
said
it's used
in different
ways
so if
one
means
that certain
kinds of things
didn't exist
at one time
and later on
those things
came into
existence
sure
they emerged
at one time
there were no
mammals
they emerged
okay
okay
but sometimes
what people
mean by that
is that there
was no
explaining
how those
things emerged
in terms of
what there was
beforehand
if that's what
they mean
by no
explaining
well again
explaining means
different things
if they mean by
no explaining
we haven't discussed
the explanation
what it is
it's another big
area in philosophy
of science
but if they mean
by that
that you can't
come up
with what you
might think of
as a satisfactory
thing that you
say ah
now I see
that might be
the case
but if what you
mean by that
is that the world
had to have more
stuff in it
in order to get
that
then I don't think
that's the case
I don't think
there had to be
anything in the world
other than
what there was
before there were
any mammals
for there to be
mammals
mammals
emerge very slowly
incidentally
we know that
from natural
selection evolution
it takes a long
time for everything
to happen
so it's not an
all or none matter
I'll leave this
up to you
but since you
mention explanation
I think that
is a good area
for us to
transition toward
but I wanted to
ask if you think
it might be better
to start by
talking about
causation
because these two
things are
interrelated
and I don't know
which direction
you'd like to
start from
well they surely
are interrelated
Bertrand Russell
was sort of like
the Sidney Morgan
Besser of his
times in philosophy
and that he's
great for quotes
his quote about
causation
I'm sure you know
I'll wait for you
I probably can do
it verbatim
I can do it
verbatim
right
the concept of
causation
is like the
British monarchy
it should be
retired
but it's not
because it's
kept around
because it's
mistakenly thought
to do no harm
now that's what
Russell said
I didn't get it
exactly right
that's what
Russell said
I don't think
that's right
I think the notion
of causation
as Nancy Cartwright
came up before
wrote in a paper
is very central
to how we think
about the world
but I don't think
it's fundamental
I don't think
that when you
get what physics
says is fundamental
the notion of
causation will be
there
and that was
one of Russell's
points
but you want
to keep it around
you want to
explain how
it emerged
not in the sense
of it having
to be added
like someone
had to come along
and say
oh let's add
some causation
now
but just explain
how whatever
the physical stuff
was there
how it getting
into a certain
situation
led there to be
causal relations
among things
and I think
giving an account
of that
is like one
of the great
tasks of
contemporary
philosophy
now that is not
something that
scientists will
engage in
but it is something
that people
in philosophy
and to some extent
in computer science
and decision theory
and other things
will enter
into
and statisticians
I don't know
have you talked
to David Papineau
I have
a couple of times
so he's writing
on this
on his probabilistic
approaches to causation
as have Judea Pearl
and Clark Leemore
and various other people
in computer science
and philosophy of science
and Jim Woodward
is another interesting
person who's written
on this
in this
oh there's a whole
other approach
that comes
originally from
David Hume
but
from David Lewis
in particular
which is sort of
a counterfactual
a countercausation
so
the throwing of the rock
caused the breaking
of the window
because if you hadn't
have thrown the rock
the window wouldn't
have broken
the first account
which is a
probabilistic statistical account
it says that
when occurrence of one event
raises the probability
of another event
or some other kinds
of probabilistic relations
and there isn't
something like we might call
a common causal explanation
of why there's a correlation
then there's a causal relation
now what I just gave
was circular
because I use causation
in the account
but the people who do this
have a way in which they
can get rid of the circularity
they think
these are the two main approaches
one of the projects
if I live long enough
that I want to do
is to connect these two projects
to these two approaches
so they're connected
because I think
if you're going to do
counterfactuals
and cause
counterfactuals right
you've got to make it
a probabilistic
account of counterfactuals
you've got to get rid
of David Lewis's approach
of counterfactuals
and that's for a metaphysics
or a logic discussion
not for today
but also something else
I'm interested in
but eventually
you're going to want
to give an account
of counterfactuals
in terms of conditional probabilities
and I think when you do that
you're going to have
an account of causation
in terms of conditional probabilities
too
but it's going to be
an account of causations
between particular events
the throwing of the rock
on this occasion
the breaking of the window
on this occasion
whereas the correlational accounts
are associated with
Papineau and Woodward
Judea Pearl
is a type causation account
and I think these two
need to be fit together
in some way
I don't know how to do it now
I don't know anybody
who's done it
but maybe that's just
because I haven't looked
around enough
I just haven't
I just don't have the time
to do it
that's a really interesting project
you have your own
dissertation project
right now right
or maybe you're going to
just be a famous film director
but if you want a dissertation project
this is what I would direct
students
I think it's a great area
you just said
many words
that I think will be foreign
to some of our listeners
who aren't familiar
with the literature
on causation
I'm sorry
no problem
so counterfactuals
one of them
conditional probability
I think we should
skip the conditional probability
for now
but it would be nice
to hear
what counterfactuals are
and how they relate
to causation
quite broadly
okay
so conditionals
in English
is something that logicians
have studied
counterfactuals
or conditional
I'm going to talk about
conditionals first
conditionals are statements
in English
that logicians have studied
for a long time
and say it's like
if this happens
then that happens
and obviously
we're very interested
in conditionals
because they're the bridges
between a this
and a that
right
okay
so
and in ordinary logic
that every student
who has to take
of logic course studies
they study material
conditionals
counterfactual conditionals
are not material conditionals
they're a little more complicated
they're
if this had happened
then this would have happened
if
they'd counted
the votes correctly
in a Boer-Bush
election of 2000
Boer would have been
Boer
Gore
Gore would have been president
I don't know
if that's true or not
but somebody might say that
Boer-Bush has a nice ring
to it too
let me take the example
that's used in the literature
all the time
if Oswald had not shot Kennedy
Kennedy would have run
a second term
I think that's plausibly true
or something like that
is true
and neighborhood is true
we understand that
now it's not an ordinary
material conditional
it's not what's called
truth functional
a truth functional conditional
it's a conditional
such that if you know
the truth values
of each part
the antecedent
and the consequent
you could know
the truth value
of the whole
counterfactual is not like that
counterfactual may say
something about
how
the antecedent
and the consequent
are connected
with each other
they are very interesting
kinds of statements
if you're interested
in science
because scientists
are interested in these
all the time
when they're doing experiments
if you were to do this
that would happen
if you had done this
this would have happened
okay
this is
in the sciences
all the time
causation
seems to be closely connected
to counterfactuals
in the way I said before
the throwing of the brick
caused the breaking
of the window
because if you hadn't
thrown the brick
the window wouldn't have broken
now that's not exactly right
it needs to be refined
that's the basic idea
and the idea
that Hume suggested
at one point
he has two definitions
of causation
this is the second one
he gives
this is the one
that David Lewis picked up
and he developed
an account of it
and he realized
it needed some refinement
he gave refinement
and a big literature
developed out of that
within what's more
properly metaphysics
but it's closely connected
to science
it needs to be modified
because I think
Lewis's account
of counterfactuals
is no good
he bases
his account of counterfactuals
on possible world similarity
I think that's a big mistake
but that's often a side topic
so I'm not going to get
into that right now
I think it needs to be done
in terms of conditional
probabilities
which we can explain
in a moment
but that's what counterfactuals are
and that's how causation
is connected to counterfactuals
and causation is another thing
that I think Russell said too
but other people have picked up
like a guy called Mackie
another philosopher
is that it's the cement
of the universe
the glue of the universe
causation relates
one event to another
and I don't really think
it's glue
or anything like that
that's ridiculous
but I do think
it's the concept we use
in order to connect events
that are connected
to explanation
we explain why one thing
happened in terms of another
by finding the causes
of events
at least that's one kind
of explanation
it's not the only kind
of explanation
but it's the one kind
of explanation
the way that you talk
about causation
in terms of counterfactuals
it makes it seem
very much like just
a description
a verbal description
of what's going on
with causation
in other words
it doesn't sound
particularly physical
or to use the term
that you just used
it seems more conceptual
in contrast to what
you just attributed
to Mackey
where he described
causation as a sort
of glue
which makes it seem
more tangible
and real
and physical
in a certain sense
I'm wondering
if you think
that this is at all
correct
and if it is correct
what some other
accounts are
of causation
that might give it
a more physical feel
even if you don't think
they're right
well I understand
why you said
what you said
now the idea
which is sort of suggested
I don't think Mackey
believe this
but it's suggested
by Mackey's phrase
is that
the world has events
in them
the events are loose
and separate
and you've got to add
some glue
to connect up
what causes what
now there are philosophers
who believe something
like that
it would be a grave
oversimplification
to say that Tim Maude
believes that
so don't attribute
that I'm saying that
to Tim Maude
but he believes something
in the neighborhood
ultimately
but not with
about causation
but about laws
okay
but there are
other philosophers
who definitely believe
that
I don't believe that
I don't think
that's right
because of the reason
that Russell said
if you look in
fundamental physics
you won't find causation
anyplace
as one of the stuff
the fundamental relations
in physics
you find spatial temporal
relations
maybe you find
entanglement relations
in quantum mechanics
or something like that
but you won't find
causal relations
they sort of emerge
in this sort of
non-metaphysical
sense of emergence
that I was using earlier
okay
so
my counterfactual count
is supposed to be
like that
now I do think
that there's something
physical
that makes those
counterfactuals come
and that's these
conditional probabilities
I think these conditional
probabilities
are in physics
that
and
now you're opening up
I wouldn't say
this is a can of worms
this is a
paradise for me
this is the main project
that I'm into
you want to show
your shirt
yeah
this is something
called
the mentaculous
okay
looks great
okay
and this is something
that's a project
is that your cat
is that meant to be
your cat
do you still have a cat
I think his name
is Bertrand Russell
it's a little complicated
here
okay
so the cat
Bertrand Russell
was given to me
and I guess
when I talked to you last
I did have him as a cat
by a student of mine
he named the cat
I would never name a cat
anything so gauche
as Bertrand Russell
but unfortunately
Bertrand Russell
dug up plants
I loved him
he was great
he left on my
set up
on my neck
all the time
but when he got off
my neck
he'd get off my neck
I could show a picture
of him on my iPad
he'd get off my neck
and he'd look around
the apartment
to dig up plants
or to knock over
we have a lot of
things
my wife said
he cannot stay
in this apartment
so he went back
to the farm
he lived on
I had a cat
before that
whom I really loved
named Loki
and this is I think
supposed to be
Loki
this shirt
was made by
a friend of mine
with whom I used
to go spend time
at a place
called Paradox Lake
and we went
and had a vacation
isn't that a good place
for philosophers to go
do you believe
there is such a place
you can look it up
it's in upstate New York
it's not that far
from
what's the closest town
Ticonderoga
is not some distance
there are other places
but look up Paradox Lake
it's a beautiful
beautiful lake
I can show you pictures
of that later
if we stop to
have it on my iPad
and it's a wonderful
place to go
and it's called Paradox
because it has two parts
and the middle part
there's a
what do they call
a little thing
that connects to
I don't know
not a canal
but a channel
and the water
goes in opposite directions
in two parts of the channel
and it was thought
to be a Paradox
it wasn't because
there were two docks
on the lake
some people
there are many docks
on the lake
and it's a great place
to go swimming
and so my
we all
we had a big
gigantic family
reunion
at this
place
a year and a half ago
and this friend of mine
made this shirt
for people there
on Paradox Lake
and this is supposed
to be a picture
of Loki the cat
that I'm looking
like Loki the cat
that's supposed
to be a picture of
yeah well anyway
you were speaking
about probability
and you were going
to get to your project
okay and the mentaculous
is a thing
again you're going
to talk to David Albert
about this in more detail
so I'm not going
to get into it
yeah but it would be
nice to hear
how it fits in
with causation
okay that's more
my that's my part
of it okay
okay so what the
mentaculous is
is it takes
an idea from physics
that we came up
earlier in our
discussion
and that is
in
during the 19th century
it's related to
central things
we've talked about
actually
in ways
I could emphasize
more
physics studies
the special sciences
the macroscopic
it also studies
the more fundamental
one of the main
special sciences
in physics
is thermodynamics
thermodynamics
concerns
gases
liquids
solids
and how they
evolve
but physicists
knew they must
be connected
to the atoms
or molecules
that make
these things up
and the question
was how are
these connected
so the physicists
who thought about
this hard
in the 19th centuries
were James Maxwell
another one of the
greats in physics
and Ludwig Boltzmann
one of the greats
so for me
if you were to have
physicists being
like mountains
like in the Himalayas
or something like that
you know
Mount Everest
would might be
Einstein
and Newton
would be right up there
but Boltzmann
and Maxwell
would be right
you know
sub peaks
right
yeah
Galileo
so they were
great people
they were interested
Boltzmann
in particular
in how
to relate
thermodynamics
to more
fundamental physics
and
in fundamental physics
thermodynamics
studied laws
like
regularities
like this
ice cubes
when you put them
in warm water
melt
gases
when you let them go
steam
when you let it go
diffuses into the air
water
when you drop
ice
ink dropping into water
spreads out in the water
people when they're born
grow old and die
all these are
thermodynamic developments
it was discovered
that there was a quantity
called entropy
we'll leave it to later
for a technical description
of what entropy is
but that all of these
should in some way
fall under the general
rubric
of
if the entropy
of some system
is not at a maximum
if that system
is isolated
from everything else
its entropy
will increase
over time
that's called
the second law
thermodynamics
Boltzmann wanted
to show how this
emerges from more
fundamental physics
in the sense of
emergence
that we talked about
earlier
but he did realize
he had to add something
ultimately
to physics
in order to do this
because he realized
he couldn't show
that as an exact
regularity
it emerges
because it doesn't follow
as an exact regularity
what follows
is that
for most
of the ways
of which atoms
or molecules
are arranged
in an ice cube
when you put it
in warm water
in the way
the water
molecules are arranged
for most of those ways
the ice cube
will melt
over time
but there'll be
some very
very atypical ways
in which it won't melt
so what Boltzmann said
is I have to introduce
probability
so he introduced
the probability
assumption
over how
the fundamental states
of the atoms
or molecules
might be arranged
for him
in classical physics
fundamental state
had to do with
where the particles are
or their relative
distances from each other
and what their relative
velocities are
or relative momentums
are relative
to each other
okay
if you have the fundamental states
well
there are lots and lots
of fundamental states
which look exactly
the same
with respect to having
an ice cube
in warm water
in fact
infinitely many
for most of them
in some sense
of most
the ice cube
will melt
for atypical ones
they won't
but it turns out
if you try to count up
with how many atypical
and how many typical states
there would be
well
and here's some
more technical things
which your listeners
might not know
but you certainly know
there are infinitely
many of each of these
in fact
there are continually
infinitely many
of each of them
so you've got to
say something more
than most
you've got to introduce
a better notion
than most
Boltzmann introduced
probability
there are other ways
of approaching this
again this is not
what we're going to
talk about now
but by probability
he thought
well
he says a probability
distribution
such as the probability
that the ice cube
will melt
is going to be
very close to 1
and the probability
that it won't melt
is going to be
very close to 0
and if he made this
assumption
as a probability
assumption
and he made this
assumption
over the whole universe
he could give a very
good argument
or a kind of argument
that the second law
of thermodynamics
would very very likely
hold
for isolated systems
throughout the whole universe
for ice cubes
and put in water
for ink drops
dropped into water
for gases
seams
under water
for people
when they're born
it is the case
that there are certain
arrangements
of your molecules
compatible
which you look like
when you're a baby
such that you will
never die
you never will die
there are arrangements
like that
wow
but they're very atypical
I hope I got that one
I didn't get it
no
the probability of it
is minuscule
actually you don't
really hope it
it wouldn't be
not a very happy life
if you never died
and there are also ones
which instead of
as you mentioned it
there are also ones
in which after a little while
you end up
suffering in terrible pain
for a long time
and there are also
other ones
which you end up
looking like
you know
I don't know
like
Donald Trump
okay
well I don't want that one
but
maybe I'll take the one
where I live
10,000 years
that sounds like
a safe
but I could handle that
I have a happy life
those two
because look
if you have
continually many things
as those who know
what a big number
that is
quite bigger than
infinity
or
the lowest card
it's at least
the second order
of infinity
maybe there are
many orders
of infinity
in between
it's a lot
and so
there's a lot of room
for all sorts of things
to be
since we're talking
about aging
I'm wondering
and since we've already
talked a little bit
you brought McTaggart up
so we talked a little bit
about time
I wonder if you view
time travel
as a question
for the philosophy
of science
and whether it may
or may not have
any bearing
on the mentaculous
or vice versa
so Tim Maudlin
as you know
has thought about this
and David Lewis
wrote a famous paper
in which he tried
to make sense
of time traveling
with his
counterfactual account
of causation
and he tried to show
that there was
no real paradoxes
you know
there's a famous paradox
the grandfather paradox
about time travel
where it says
that look
if you get time travel
you can go back
and kill your grandfather
then where would you be
okay
well the answer is
of course
if you went back
in time
you just wouldn't
kill your grandfather
okay
so
which also
brings up
the question
between
how physics
and free will
are related
I don't know
you want to talk
about that or not
but that's
another thing
I've written about
and it's an interesting
subject
but
so
with
ince
general relativity
general relativity
looks like
it allows
certain solutions
to the
Einstein's field equations
which allow
for the possibility
of the being
so-called
cause time-like
loops
I believe
Tim thinks
that while
these are allowed
by the equations
Tim's own view
about what time
is
should rule them out
I think
this should
embarrass
Tim
that
but
those are
fighting words
I'm sure
he
look
Tim and I
get along
well
he can beat
me up
in any argument
that we got
into
any day
of the week
he could beat
me up
about what
I had
for breakfast
he's just
good
that's right
he is the
clearest thinker
I've ever run
into
but he's not
right about
everything
that's a
very good
compliment
it's really true
I mean
it's definitely
the case
and the best
expositor
of stuff
I've ever run
into
we've reached
another bifurcation
where I'll let you
decide where to go
from here
but we initially
got into causation
to talk a bit
about explanation
I'm not sure
we've quite
gotten there yet
so we could
talk about
explanation
or you mentioned
earlier your
project with
David about
reductionism
maybe I should
go back to that
because we almost
got to that
let's do it
okay
okay
so back to
Boltzmann
Boltzmann introduced
this probability
distribution
he didn't really
know what to
think what
probability is
what is
probability
that's a really
interesting
question
quote from
Bertrand Russell
again
this I think
I can do
verbatim
because I love
it so much
Russell said
probability
is the most
important concept
in contemporary
science
especially since
nobody knows
what it means
another very
good one
right
Russell was
great
yes he was
thing
and
my favorite
which everyone
knows is
it has all
the merits
of theft
over honest
toil
and if you
can get away
with it
yeah
and try to
keep your
it should be
philosophy policeman
though to keep
you from getting
away with it
so anyway
so
Tim is one
okay
philosophy policeman
that is
so he didn't
know what
probability is
I think that
one of the main
contributions
in the history of
philosophy in the
20th century
is people thinking
about this question
there have been a lot
of attempts to
answer it
there's a very
interesting entry
in the Stanford
encirclopedia of
philosophy done by
Al Hayek
who will also be
visiting New York
soon who's another
close associate of
mine
so I have gotten
to know a lot of
people who are
important
have you done an
interview with him
I have not
you should get him
yeah I need a look
at your pocketbook
he's a good
interviewer too
a good person
a good interviewee
very good person
and he knows
everything there is
about probability
I'm not sure I've
drawn him into my
camp about this
completely
I think I've done
it a little bit
but not completely
but so you might
read his article
in the Stanford
Encyclopedia of
Philosophy
it's very good
basically there are
a lot of different
views of what
probability is
I think the really
great idea was
thought up by the
person who I think
is the towering
figure in 20th
century philosophy
and that is David
Lewis
and David Lewis
had a view about
laws that's connected
with his view about
probability
so we're going to
connect the two
in a little while
if you want to
talk about laws
we're going to be
running out of time
and David's going
to show up
but
Lewis had a view
about probability
it's part of his
best systems account
of laws and
probability
that I think
when you take
really seriously
is a view about
what objective
probability is
now another very
great idea about
probability concerns
another Stanford person
or at least he was
at Stanford for a while
connected to Nancy
Cartwright for a while
they separated
I'm sure you know
him as Ian Hacking
I didn't know him
personally
I didn't meet him
once but I didn't
know him very much
but I think his book
Emergence of Probability
is also one of the
great things written
in probability
and in it
he says
probability is a
Janus
faced concept
so two faces
two faces
Janus was the Roman
God
on a coin
with two faces
and by two faces
it meant
one face
here's what
hacking meant
one face looks
at the mind
the other face
looks at the world
probability has an
aspect that looks
at the mind
because it tells you
something about
what your degree
of confidence
or degree of belief
or degree of ignorance
should be in something
but it should be based
on what the world
is really like
Lewis's account
of probability
in the best systems
account
is an account
that says
here's what the world
is like
for these to be
the right probabilities
Lewis also
recognized
that Janus face
and he also
had a principle
that connected up
the objective
objective probabilities
with what your degrees
of belief
should be like
what your degree
of ignorance
should be like
he called this
the principle principle
again this is a whole
other thing to talk
about with somebody
who was maybe
on another occasion
but basically
he thinks that
to put it very roughly
it needs to be refined
that if the objective
probability
of a certain event
is 0.6
other things being equal
to your degree of belief
and that happening
should be 0.6
as well
now I think
this principle
works much better
if you're doing
conditional
objective probabilities
and conditional
degrees of belief
so if the objective
conditional probability
of it raining tonight
given such and such
facts about the world
now maybe
contemporary weather
conditions
and other situations
now
it raining tonight
is 0.7
then your degree of belief
given all of that stuff
should also be 0.7
I think that principle
is basically correct
but where those
objective probabilities
come from
well I think they come
from Boltzmann's
statistical mechanics
now why do I think that
well Boltzmann's
conditional probability
Boltzmann's probability
distribution
was a probability distribution
over all the
possible fundamental
states of the world
and so they give
conditional probabilities
over everything
now there is
something we're going
to have to conditionalize
in order to get the right
conditional probabilities
and the person who gave
the right name
to this thing
is David Albert
he called it the
past hypothesis
but it's an idea
that floated around
Boltzmann in some sense
had this idea
but definitely
Eddington had it
and Feynman had it
and other people had it
and that is that the world
Penrose has it
that the world
had a very very
low entropy state
it's a thing in cosmology
near the beginning
of the universe
and when we conditionalize
on that
then we'll get
the right conditional
probabilities
when we conditionalize
on other stuff
later on
now that we got that
we got conditional probabilities
over everything
now frankly
I'm sure David knew this
but you know
I'm an older guy
than David
I don't know how
he would want to view it
but in some sense
David became a philosopher
in part because he met me
and I was already a philosopher
and he was a physicist
and we got to be friends
but I learned more from him
than I did from anybody else
and because he's a
I wouldn't say
he's the clearest thinker
I wouldn't say
David is the clearest thinker
David is not as
he's very clear
but he's not
in the same way
that him is
but David is the most
creative thinker
I've known
and so I learned a lot
and he was very willing
to teach me
and I think a lot
of what came from David
he came in interacting
by me saying
yeah do you really think that
or well look
if that's so
then what about this
so I don't know
how much
he would want to
bring me into this
I shouldn't bring myself
into his views
he shouldn't let him do that
but I certainly learned
a lot from him
so I do know
that when we were talking about
when he was writing his book
Time and Chance
we were talking about it a lot
and I came to see
and like I said
he probably realized this all along
that look
if you had this view
about statistical mechanics
that the view
about statistical mechanics
is that when the world began
it began this low entropy state
and there was a probability
distribution over all
the fundamental
the possible fundamental
states of the world
that the world could be in
you would end up
with probabilities
or conditional probabilities
over everything
including the conditional probability
over Harris winning
the current election
given such and such
facts about the universe now
okay
and if you think about it
for a second
well of course
because if you knew
the whole fundamental
physical state of the world now
you would know
whether Harris would win
the election or not
right
as Laplace pointed out
to Napoleon
they say
a long time ago
okay
but of course
we're never going to know
the fundamental
well fundamentals
it's not a possibility
it's not even a physical possibility
so
so we call this
the mentaculous
that's what this shirt is about
and this is a project
that we've been working on
and now if you google
mentaculous
the word of course
as you know
comes from the film
by Ethan and Jonathan Cohn
called A Serious Man
where there's a minor character
scribbling in a book
and someone says
what is that book
and he says
it's the mentaculous
and someone says
what's that
and he says
it's a probability map
of the world
and that's what this is
it's a probability map
of the world
so we just took this
from Ethan Cohn
now I quickly add
that the character in the film
is clearly out of his mind
and is meant to be depicted
like that
and we thought that
when people
when I tell other people
that I think
there's objective probabilities
over everything
the first thing
they're going to look at me
Lewis said
people looked at him
with an incredulous stare
when they tell him
about all the possible worlds
I do think
they'll look at me
with an incredulous stare
when I tell him
there are probabilities
over everything
but I do think
a good argument
can be made
for this
next thing I want to say
is that
David and I got to know
Ethan Cohn
because of this
because I had Ethan
Cohn's email
so I would email him
and he said
he wanted to talk to us
so we used to meet him
regularly at a cafe
not far from here
and talk about physics
and we emailed with him
until recently
I used to get
two or three emails a day
from that stuff
we'd argue about
I don't want to get into that
okay
but I do think
the Metaculous
is a serious
philosophical project
whether it'll
survive philosophical
scrutiny or not
that's a question
it's come under
some criticism
by some people
and some replies to it
and there are issues
and it's closely related
to reductionism
because I do think
it can be used
to support
my kind of reductionism
the kind of reduction
in which there's
emergence
without adding anything
more to the universe
other than this
probability distribution
and the past hypothesis
and those are really
scientific things
that you're adding
to the universe
I tend to lose
track of time
during these conversations
so I'm not sure
if it was 15 minutes ago
or half an hour ago
that you mentioned
free will
but I would be
very curious to hear
whether you think
free will is a problem
for philosophy of science
or for science in general
or and how you just
think about free will
in general
well many many scientists
have thought about free will
I know that
I just talked to one
who did
who came to a lecture
I gave
about free will
and so they're
interested in it
they have an inkling feeling
that maybe what they learn
about in science
somehow has some
incompatibility
with their being free will
and there have been
metaphysicians
a famous one
who's wrote a couple
of books about this
named Peter Van Inwagen
I don't know if you know
his work or not
okay
who's given an argument
a famous argument
I'm not sure he's the first
person who thought up
this argument
but he definitely gave it
a clear formulation
called the consequence argument
which is supposed to show
that free will
and fundamental physics
are incompatible
with each other
and the idea is
that if there are laws
over everything
whether they're deterministic
or whether they're probabilistic
there's no room
for free will
why is that
how does the
consequent argument
okay I'll do it
for determinism
things are a little
fancier for
if the fundamental laws
are indeterministic
but there's good reason
to think the fundamental laws
even if quantum mechanics
are deterministic
whatever you may have heard
about quantum mechanics
okay
that's another
well Tim's somebody
who thinks that
they're deterministic
Tim thinks they're deterministic
let him
people can listen to
our episodes
on Bohmian mechanics
yeah okay
so I'm with Tim
about that
okay
okay
so
the basic idea
is this
it's really simple
very straightforward
easy to explain
look
if you have free will
it's got to be the case
that your actions
will
make a difference
to what happens
so what does that mean
well we're back
to counterfactuals now
which means
that if you were to
decide to do this
that would happen
if you were to decide
to do something else
something else would happen
if you have free will
that's got to be the case
but now Peter Van Inuyken
comes along and says
but look
you're not free
about what things
that happened
in the distant past
are you
if you were to decide
to do this
it wouldn't make a difference
to stuff in the distant past
would it
most people would respond
and say
well of course not
I mean I know
I can't do anything
about
makes sense to me
can't do
wait a few minutes
okay
okay
can't do anything
about
can't no crying
over spilled milk
and you can't do anything
about the laws
right
the laws are the laws
you can't decide
to break the laws
if you jump off
you know
if someone pushes you
off the building
you can't say
I'd like to suspend
the law of gravity
now so I fall gently
to the ground
it's not going to work
right
you can't do that
but
the laws in the past
if determinism is right
entails what will happen
in the future
so it looks like
it validly follows
and I do believe it does
as Van Inuyken said
that
you can't do anything
about the future
therefore you have
no free will
that's the argument
I think the argument
is a valid argument
now
logicians
or philosophers
say
well a valid argument
is only good
if it's sound
as well as valid
the premises
will have to be true
so let's look more
carefully at the premises
one says you can't
do anything about the laws
the other one says
you can't do anything
about the past
now David Lewis
wrote a famous paper
about this
in which he said
well
when you look at
the right way
to evaluate counterfactuals
it'll turn out
to be the case
that if you had
decided to do
something different
then in fact
you would have
violated a law
but in the past
you would have
violated a law
so you're not going
to be able to
suspend the law
of gravity
in the future
I think Lewis's way
of doing counterfactuals
is wrong
I think the right way
to evaluate
counterfactuals
is that
when you evaluate
counterfactuals
nothing you do
would ever violate
laws
okay
we're going to get
into more details
about counterfactuals
if people who listen
to this podcast
really understand
going to understand it
I do think
that if
you were
to have decided
to do something
if you were to decide
something differently
from what you actually
decide
then the past
would have been different
way back to the Big Bang
and in fact
statistical mechanics
shows how that
could be the case
but be careful
about it
because you won't
be able to affect
anything macroscopic
in a way that you
care about
what was the case
is that
had you decide
something different
than the microscopic
history of the world
would have been
different microscopically
while the macroscopic
history of the world
would have been
exactly the same
and that's because
of something
that everyone
who studies
statistical mechanics
knows about
I'll do it
in a vivid way
it's something
called the butterfly effect
and it's that
very small differences
in the microscopic
state
could make for
a very big difference
in the macroscopic
state later on
the butterfly effect
means that
a very small difference
in the macroscopic
thing that
determines whether
a butterfly flaps
its wings or not
in Africa
might make for
a difference
whether that's
a storm
off the coast
of the United States
sometime later
and that's right
okay
so
I illustrate that
with a
I'm not wearing
the right t-shirt
to illustrate that
my other t-shirt
you've got a lot
of t-shirts
I like them
but basically
if you were to
give a history
of the universe
if you write
history of the universe
microscopically
and determinism
it would just be
a straight line
if this is the
fundamental
microscopic
state the world
started in
that was the way
it would go on
forever
but if you did it
macroscopically
it would be branching
so at the
macroscopic level
the world is full
of chanciness
and the chances
come from
the statistical
mechanics
in this
Boltzmanian account
that I told about
earlier
that's where
the mentaculous
comes from
and the idea
that this is so
like I said
I think David
had this idea
when he was writing
the book
but the idea
that this has
such consequences
for philosophy
that I really
just stumbled into
because I knew
David
is fantastic
I think it's
incredibly
powerful idea
for philosophy
has consequences
for how to think
about kind of
factual
causation
knowledge
epistemology
all over the
place
and so on
so I think
it's a
it's a totally
great field
for philosophy
so the
mentaculous
and I'm writing
a book now
the book is called
The Mentaculous
Vision
and it's basically
about how you
take this idea
and its consequences
are for philosophy
all over the place
like again
you know
like people
when they do
in philosophy
they write a book
and other people
come along
and they tell you
what's wrong
with what you're
doing
I'm sure that'll
be the case here
and maybe it's
wrong from the
very beginning
so for example
Tim's way of
approaching statistical
mechanics
doesn't use probability
it uses typicality
and he might object
from the very beginning
but his way
is not the typical
way of approaching
quantum mechanics
in fact
we're approaching
statistical mechanics
if I could say that
to use the word
typicality
back on Tim
most people
statistical mechanics
use probability
not typicality
but Tim belongs
to a tribe
which uses typicality
That was
an excellent story
now
I would love
to talk
about laws
a bit more
they came up
at the beginning
of our conversation
and
they've come up
a lot now
so it might be
a good time
to get a bit
clearer about them
I think
a good question
to start with
is
just the landscape
of views
on what laws are
and I'll give you
two options
about views
so one
takes laws
to be
maybe more conceptual
they're descriptions
of generalities
of things
another
takes laws
to be something
more robustly
metaphysical
something baked
into the fabric
of the universe
something that might
be commanded
by God
I'm wondering
if there are
words or
terms of art
to describe
these views
what these views
are
if you could
elaborate on them
more
and if I'm right
if these are
two good poles
in the landscape
you're absolutely right
it's a good way
of describing it
and it connects up
with two things
we talked about earlier
namely chances
and causation
so let me say
a little bit more
about views here
and a little bit
about the history
of the concept of laws
is that okay
we have time for that
absolutely
in the history
of the concept of laws
like I said
much earlier
that the contemporary
concept really didn't
come up until the 17th century
with Galileo
Descartes
Newton
and so on
some other people
Cassidy Boyle
and basically
it was very
theologically connected
laws were thought of
as the principles
that described
how God moved
matter around
that's definitely
how Descartes
thought about laws
so he did connect
it with theology
God gradually
fell out of it
I think Newton
thought about it
like that too
frankly
that's a more
subtle question
so
but God fell out
of it
because
you didn't want
God in the science
so much
not to everybody
and in fact
another quote
I'll tell you about
that two people
who
I guess I used
this quote
it's a quote from me
that's a good
personal quote
yeah
the best
is that
but both
Nancy Cartwright
and a philosopher
called John Foster
held it
and that is
if there were no God
there'd be no laws
John Foster used it
and he used it
as an argument
for the existence of God
because he thought
there were laws
Nancy Cartwright used it
and he used it
as an argument
for the existence
of non
for the nonexistence
of laws
of this sort
I
think it's wrong
I think you can have
laws
without God
but not of the robust sort
that you were talking
about before
and the person
who had a view
about what laws are
of a non-robust sort
that I think works out
pretty well
and it's closely connected
to his view
about probability
or chance
was David Lewis
so here was David Lewis's
idea
or maybe I'll tell you
about the other idea
first a little bit
so in philosophy
there wasn't much written
about what laws are
that's a philosophical question
in the history of philosophy
Kant had some
Kantian view
but while there are people
at Stanford
I think you understand
what Kant has to say
I've never really had
a conversation with him
about this
I would like to
at some point in my life
I don't know
I've ever really talked
to Michael Friedman
but I'm sure he knows
a lot
he truly knows
a lot more about Kant
than I'll ever know
about Kant
so Kant wrote about this
but he had
this sort of Kantian view
but in the 19th century
people just didn't write
about this much
Peirce says a little bit
about it
and then the positivists
were very down
on metaphysics
so then
in the late 1970s
1980s
some philosophers
were more metaphysicians
when the logical positives
were thought to have been
killed off by
I don't know
who killed them off
Popper and Quine
in different ways
or something like that
okay
they
were free to have
metaphysical views
so Armstrong had the view
that he had a robust view
laws had to be added
to the universe
over and above
the ordinary facts
in the universe
you had to add connections
between universals
for there to be laws
he called them
connections of
contingent necessitation
swallow that if you can
laws of contingent necessitation
that was Armstrong's view
you can't ask him about it
because he died
some years ago
Tim has the view
that laws are just
what they are
they're just extra things
that you add to the universe
and they make things happen
in the universe
I think this is
I don't know
what you say
should I say bananas
bananas works
I think you just can't
make sense of how
this is supposed to be
but Tim disagrees
with me about this
and Tim's a very smart man
so
here's David Lewis' views
all there are
are the ordinary facts
he's more what you said
as a conceptual side
although I'm not sure
I'd go along with that
quite a way of doing it
but it's non-robust
in the sense
you meant robust
I think that's how
it should be
you should be robust
about the things
that really exist
you shouldn't be
rather robust
about the things
that you don't think exist
so what are laws
well his view
about what laws are
is that look
there are the ordinary facts
there's the whole
history of ordinary facts
and what we're interested
in laws are
are finding out
the best systematization
the best ways
of organizing
systematizing
unifying
all of those
fundamental facts
that's what the laws
are entailments
of the best systematization
of all of them
that's what laws are
now
I'm just
I'm just so close
to it I'll add this
what chances are
is we introduce probability
as a way
to help us systematize
the ordinary facts
you can see how
that might work
might work
because if
for example
the ordinary facts
consist of
the outcomes
of a head
of core dorses
now we don't think
that's those
of fundamental facts
but it's a H-T-T-T-H-T-H-T-T-T-H-T-T
we might see
gee
if we were to describe
that in a fundamental way
that would be
very very complicated
but probability
might enable us
to describe that
in a simple way
and give us
a lot of information
about it
that's what Lewis' idea
so Lewis' idea
is the best systematization
optimizes
simplicity
informativeness
and other
criteria
that science
is after
and laws
are what's entailed
by that best
systematization
of the world
now I think
that's pretty robust
you know
this raises
a very interesting
question
we've already
talked about
Leonard Susskind
so let me
just bring him
in here
for a moment
you're
obviously aware
of the string
theoretic multiverse
where there are
upwards of
10 to the 50
10 to the 500
pocket universes
and in each of these
ostensibly
there lives
a different physics
this is how
the string theorists
like Leonard Susskind
accounts for the
fine tuning problem
and the reason
that there are
different physics
in these different
pocket universes
has to do with
the fact that
each of these universes
corresponds to
one of the say
10 to the 500
ground states
of the string
or different
fluxes
things like this
so there are
different physics
laws of physics
ostensibly
in these different
pocket universes
does that mean
for you
that
the laws
of nature
can vary
across time
and place
look
first of all
in Susskind's view
is he thinks
that there is
our laws
that hold
in all these
universes
namely the laws
of string theory
so what he's doing
is modifying
or changing
some of the parameters
in these laws
to get these
different universes
that same
is true
in Newton's
universes too
change the positions
and
momenta
of the particles
in the universe
and you get
different universes
now Newton
had no reason
to say they really
exist in the same sense
I'm not sure
Susskind does either
for that matter
cosmologists
you know
everybody has
their favorite
multiverse
Susskind gets him
out of
string theory
Alan Guth
gets him
out of
inflationary theory
which maybe
he can connect
to string theory
or maybe not
in some way
and David Lewis
gets him out
of his
metaphysical
multiverse
and there are
some philosophers
Alistair Wilson
have you talked to him
he tries to connect up
he's a British philosopher
tries to connect up
the
Lewis
with the
with one of these
I'm not sure
which one he does it
with actually
I'm not a fan
of any of that stuff
but anyhow
okay
but I think
Susskind has gone
off the deep end
here a little bit
because first of all
his many verses
uses
you could do the same
thing with Newton
now why does he think
they really exist
does he say that
does he answer that question
because he doesn't think
that there's any
better explanation
for solving the
fine tuning problem
but I think also
it has to do
with the cosmological
constant
I think that's
a very big part
of it
well that's one
that's the fine tuning
problem
I know
but it's a bigger
part of it
to him
than the other
or the constants
of the standard model
better than God
sorry
why do you think
it's a better
explanation than God
because he thinks
that God
is metaphysics
and he doesn't go
in for supernatural
I think what he's doing
is metaphysics
okay
or something
in the pejorative sense
what he's doing
is bad metaphysics
or bad physics
okay
okay
I mean
I'm not sure
I'd bring him
to say that
to Leonard Susskind
if he's in the room
because he's a real physicist
but look
I understand
what he's saying
and I think
the fine tuning problem
is a very interesting problem
but I think the idea
that you're doing this
as an explanation
is based on a mistaken view
about explanation
in fact
and in fact
fine tuning
will be the last chapter
of my Mentaculous book
oh that's terrific
I mean
I find it a very
fascinating problem
I do think it's a fascinating
and interesting problem
and have you talked
to Dean Zimmerman at all
he's a colleague of mine
also at Rutgers
he's more philosophy of religion
but he's also a metaphysician
who also I think
knows
he should be
paying attention
to physics stuff
and he does a little bit
about it
he's a great human being
that's what I'd say
about him
he's currently the chair
so he may not have
no time to talk to you
about anything
but he's run
he has a whole big project
from Templeton
on the fine tuning problem
that both David and I
have talked in
and I'm interested
in the fine tuning problem
and I think there are
some philosophers
who've gone
in totally the wrong direction
about the fine tuning problem
also
John Hawthorne is one
have you talked to him
or not
because they're not
philosophers of science
but I do think
they're making a certain
elementary philosophy
of science mistake
as I think Leonard
Susskind is making
so maybe we should talk
to philosophers of science
a little bit more frequently
in order to think
that he should go
in that direction
to come up with an explanation
of the cosmological constant
right but as you mentioned
he's not interested
in talking to philosophers
but he talked to you
he said
I don't know
where did he get that from
did he know Pat Soupy's
well my guess
is that it comes from
and some people
don't think that
this distinction
holds water anymore
but it comes from
continental philosophy
and people like
Latour
somebody I haven't
has he read Latour
I have no idea
nobody at Stanford
probably has ever
read Latour
nobody in philosophy
that I know
has ever read Latour
I know a little bit
about Latour
because I live in France
but he's not
in analytic philosophy
people in analytic philosophy
there's some people
who do philosophy of science
now want to bring in
continental philosophy
a little bit
but I don't do that
because I don't know
that much about it
and Habermes
Moss I think
is Habermes
yeah
well you
I take it
think that there is
a distinction
between continental
and analytic philosophy
there is in a sense
yeah
but you know
if you've looked
at continental philosophy
now
it's being taken over
by analytic philosophy
or what I think
of as analytic philosophy
of science
so I'm giving a talk
at LMU
in Munich
in December
where there is
a great department
and in fact
somebody from California
a friend of mine also
I'm sorry to say
that I'm bringing up
people I know
because I
the only bringing up
people I know
Alyssa Ney
have you talked to her
so she just took a position
she was at Davis
but she just took a position
as the chair
of metaphysics
but she's a philosopher
of quantum mechanics
she's edited a book
on wave function realism
with David actually
maybe
or maybe
she was the only editor
I'm not sure
well
Barry
we have run the gamut
on the introduction
to the philosophy of science
of course we couldn't
cover everything
in this period
but
it's been
absolutely
excellent
thank you so much
for taking the time
so thanks
I'm sorry
we didn't do
a standard
course
I put out
a syllabus
of a standard
philosophy of science
course
there's a lot
of standard things
we didn't talk about
because I don't teach it
in quite a standard
way
and we did talk
about a lot of things
I'm interested in
I had a good time
so
I'm looking forward
to the next round
okay
