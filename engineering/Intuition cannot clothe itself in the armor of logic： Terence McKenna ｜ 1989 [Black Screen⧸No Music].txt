Intuition cannot clothe itself in the armor of logic, but I hope I demonstrated to you that the armor of logic is wide mesh chain mail. In fact, it's chicken wire. In fact, it may be chicken shit, so.
The first thing I wanted to talk about was because the winter, because the summer solstice is a great pagan celebration and because I think we self-consciously celebrate it with the sense that we are participating in something which goes slightly against the grain of the dominator culture in which we're embedded.
And because that culture has made a paragon of reason, I thought it might be fun tonight to just talk a little bit about reason and intuition and the forms and the politics that attend each.
So let me dig into this a little and think aloud.
Reason, which is always held up as the path to true understanding, has two forms.
They are called deduction and induction.
And all forms of reason can be subsumed under these two types.
Now deduction, which is considered the stronger form of reason, is called reasoning from first principles, and it works like this.
You start from an idea which cannot be proven.
You accept it as given and you reason outward from it.
An example that is familiar to all of us would be Euclid's elements of plane geometry.
You start with what appears to be an incontrovertible truth or what we agree appears to be an incontrovertible truth.
In the case of Euclid, propositions such as parallel lines never cross, never meet.
Well, you can imagine a railroad in your head and run your mind along it to infinity,
and then you've inspected the infinite railroad, and lo and behold at no point did the rails cross,
so you accept this as true, then you can reason from it.
Now, in the case of the Euclidean proposition that parallel lines don't meet,
you test the truth of it by carrying out this imaginary inspection of the items involved,
and verifying that the statement appears true in all cases that you can imagine.
But other forms of other branches of human knowledge also use deduction.
Interestingly enough, theology. Theology.
So theology reasons like in the following manner.
God exists.
This is perhaps not Christian theology.
This is a generic theology.
God exists because Christian theology would seek to go further back and prove in some cases,
such as in scholasticism, that God exists.
But let's just start with the given assumption that God exists.
And then a second assumption.
And God loves us.
Given these two assumptions,
then deduction goes to work and elaborates an explanation for why we are not with God,
how we can get to God, and so forth and so on.
So deduction is useful.
Notice that my two examples have been drawn from, in the case of Euclid mathematics,
in the case of the second case, from theology, a branch of philosophy.
So deduction seems to have an important role in these abstract systems.
But remember, I said it was one of two forms of reasoning that are ordinarily dealt with.
Now, the second form of reasoning is, to my mind, more interesting.
The second form of reasoning is induction.
Not deduction.
Not deduction.
Induction.
Induction.
And induction, for those who believe in it, is thought to be, without doubt, a superior form of reasoning to deduction,
because it leads to a control and a manipulation of real consequences in the world.
Okay, what is induction, and how it works, and how does it work?
Well, it works like this.
When I hit the water with a shovel, it makes a splash.
Every time I hit the water with the shovel, it makes a splash.
Therefore, this is the leap, the therefore, therefore, shovels can be used to make water splash.
Now, notice what is interesting about this, in contrast to deduction, is that there is no untested first principle.
You don't state something, and then reason from it.
You make repetitious observations, and then those observations which are most repetitious, you raise to the status of laws.
Induction.
And this was abhorrent to philosophical thinkers, because it doesn't have this Aristotelian purity that deduction has.
It doesn't have this mathematical elegance, it's messy.
It's all down in the world, observing and comparing and repeating, experimentally, procedures.
But nevertheless, out of inductive reasoning comes the structure of modern science.
Okay, but now there's a funny thing about induction.
It's making an unstated assumption about time.
It is making the assumption that time is invariant, because what it is saying is, if A precedes B in a thousand cases, then it is likely that A will precede B in the thousand and first case.
In other words, it's a probabilistic theory.
It assumes that probabilistic laws give momentum to repetitious observation.
Now, the question is, is this so?
And the answer is, well, it's so in some cases, but not in the most interesting cases.
The most interesting cases, I believe, are the cases which lie in the realm of primary experience of being, the felt experience of being.
And in that realm, the realm of love affairs, divorces, lawsuits, religions, political upheavals, and that sort of thing, induction is no good guide at all.
One love affair does not explain another.
One marriage does not illuminate another.
One revolution really does not shed light on another.
There may be generalizations, but when you live through these things, what you take from them is the uniqueness of the experience.
The first principles that are reasoned from in deduction, whether in the realm of a deductive mathematical system like Euclid or a rational theology, these things are seen to rest on foundations of sand because of this problem of the axiom.
In mathematics, the axiom appears fairly secure because it's self-evident, such as parallel lines never meet.
It rests on its self-evidence to make its appeal to reason.
You see, you can see that it is true, though no one has ever figured out how to prove this.
You can see that it is true.
But when you move from the realm of axioms to the realm of theological first principles, the appeal then is not at all to the obviousness of it, but to the desirability of it.
That God exists, that God loves us.
We hope these things are true, but they are certainly not self-evident in the scheme of things from the point of view of most of us.
So, what this shows then, I think, is that in the matter of deeper things, deductive reasoning rests only on the appeal that hope can lend to its case.
Okay, so for me, this is a critique of deduction.
Now, what about induction?
I refer to the fact that its premises rest on this notion of temporal invariance, which seems to be true only for the grossest of phenomena.
Science has made great hay in that dimension by creating laws which are essentially predictive laws of cyclical phenomena that define for us what part of reality goes around and comes around.
In other words, we can predict simple phenomena involving the mechanical orbits in gravitational fields.
We can make simple predictions about the end results of certain chemical processes, certain nuclear processes, so forth and so on.
But when you lay it against the background of nature and experience, it begins to look like pretty thin soup.
It's no basis for claiming epistemic preeminence.
And this is the point that I want to make.
Science claims epistemic preeminence.
That means that science doesn't say we are an ideology like Buddhism and Taoism and the Tarot.
They say we are a meta-system.
We shall judge all other systems in our scales.
Well, this is politics but not good philosophy because there is no basis for this claim to epistemic preeminence.
So, this somewhat egghead rave is supposed to pass for a pagan polemic on the summer solstice because it's an attack on the foundations of reason itself.
And as you know, when reason goes, barbarism and madness cannot be far behind.
And as a self-declared philosophical anarchist, as in fact the founding member of the Henri Poincar√© Anarchist International, our motto is chaos is order, I believe that it's entirely appropriate to carry out an attack on reason.
Okay, so then, what are we left with?
Well, what we are left with is intuition.
Intuition.
And what is it and how does it work?
Well, it's a feeling into things that comes to answers and leaves no trail.
That's the thing.
It leaves no trail.
So, you have it but you haven't the argument for it.
So, its power must reside in its truthfulness.
So, the power of intuition lies in its ability to express truth in contravention to the forward flow of logic and casuistry.
Well, is it always to be this, you know how the Tao is presented as this eastern concept that you can barely wrap your mind around and that hovers at the edge of intelligibility.
Well, really, these so called obscure oriental philosophical stances always turn out to have a corollary in western thinking and the corollary to the Tao, to Taoism, is intuitionalism.
Is, you know, an ability to sense the constraints and opportunities in the moment and act through it.
Intuition.
And intuition is always presented in the dominator society as one vague, two feminine, three unreliable.
But this is simply because of this bias toward deductive and inductive systems whose falsity I have just demonstrated to you.
In fact, in the felt domain of experience called living, intuition is how most of us, even the most self defined as non intuitional, are operating.
Intuition is a kind of field processing of both the foreground and the background of experience.
It's a gestalt understanding that is subliminal and that leads the whole organism through an invisible set of creodes towards the maximizing of some kind of a goal.
Okay, end of act one.
The second act opens in the middle of the 19th century with science responding, albeit unconsciously, to an understanding of what I've just said.
The inadequacy of reason, the necessity of intuition, and yet all this going on in a domain of Victorian gentlemen with beards to their belts, and a world where pianos wore pants.
So, you know, it worked its way out subtly in the notion of evolution.
And evolution is a very interesting concept that even those of us who profess to believe in it, I think, don't fully grasp, you know, what comes in this package.
We all are taught that in the 19th century a great struggle was waged between science and religion because science had the audacity to suggest that human beings were descended from the great apes.
And we all know who took what sides and the kind of polemics that were raised.
And we all know the happy ending of this story with the great triumph of modern evolutionary biology.
However, that, to my mind, looking at it from the point of view of a philosopher, is all sham.
Or it's like the 11 o'clock news version of what actually happened.
That's how rather silly people understood the great intellectual watershed struggle of the 19th century.
That is not, in fact, what it was about.
That's not what it was about.
The outrageous assertion of the evolutionists, of Darwin particularly, and his school,
was not that human beings were descended from the great apes.
In fact, the outrageous assertion wasn't even contained in the part of the manuscript that was called the descent of man.
You recall it was called the origin of species and the descent of man.
And where the real kicker was lodged was in the origin of species.
Why?
Because Darwin set out to show that nature could be the product of processes without purpose.
That was the bit that brought the roof down.
Ordinary people couldn't understand this.
This is called the so-called teleological issue.
But this is what brought the Christian church roaring to its feet in confrontation with evolutionary biology.
The assertion that nature could be accounted for by processes that were not guided toward a higher end by a higher power.
That simply random molecular processes and then pressures of environmental selection could cause to come to be animals, plants, and ultimately human beings.
But the fight was over teleology.
The fight was over whether or not the universe has a purpose toward which all creation moves ineluctably.
Or whether nature is what the Darwinists called it, which was trendlessly fluctuating, trendlessly fluctuating.
So it was an attack on God, not the divinity, not the divine status of man.
That was peanuts in this poker game.
It was an attack on the need for God, per se, as an efficient cause in the machinery of universal being.
Well, it's a very interesting question and a very interesting struggle because we are still caught up in it.
American transcendentalism, while all this was going on in England,
American transcendentalism was exploring the transcendental realms of the human spirit cast against the background of the American landscape.
And this question of the telos in nature was, you know, to make friends, lifelong friends into enemies and sunder families.
Alfred Russell Wallace, who was the co-discoverer of evolution with Darwin, really preceded him.
He, he, uh, had a fever.
He was a professional butterfly collector, as I was once in my youth.
And on the island of Ternate in eastern Indonesia, Wallace fell into a malarial fever.
And at the height of this fever, he wrote down a page and a half of scribbling,
which, when he came down from this illness and read it, it seemed to hold up.
And what he had discovered was what all biology was seeking, what he called the solution to the problem of the species.
And he looked at this thing, and what it was, was a description of natural selection.
And it seemed to work.
Well, Wallace was, uh, from the lower classes, had made his living in England as a surveyor,
was, uh, essentially a field biologist, because he was not accepted by the gentleman scientists of England.
He didn't know where to turn.
So he fired off a letter to the only person he could think of to ask who was the greatest biologist of the day,
Charles Darwin, at home in England, in his garden, working over 20 years of notes on the problem of the species.
When Darwin got this letter from this unknown character, postmarked Ambon Dutch East Indies, and read it, he paled visibly.
And he went to his friend, Sir Charles Lyle, who was the great, the greatest geologist of the day, the proponent of catastrophism,
and one of the great, was to develop into one of the great defenders of Darwin's theory.
He went to Charles Lyle and said, uh, I've been working 20 years on this idea.
This came in the post. This, this is it. It's all here.
And Lyle said, don't worry, my friend, we will schedule two papers to be delivered at the Royal Society.
They will be delivered on the same evening, and yours shall be first.
And so it was. And so it comes down to us as Darwin's theory of evolution.
But in fact, in a way, for philosophical purists, it may have been better that way.
Because Wallace, who was in many ways a deeper thinker than Darwin, was a Fabian socialist, was fascinated by paranormal phenomena,
as well as being interested in electricity, biogeography, anthropology, truly one of the last of the great polymaths.
Wallace was unable to take the final step on the question of teleology.
And he said, I cannot believe that random processes ameliorated by natural selection can give rise to a creature such as man.
So this was the break in the 19th century.
And it, uh, it arises out of the earlier foundation of the struggle between intuition and reason.
I mean, I think our intuition must place us in Wallace's camp, that there is a telos of some sort.
There is an omega point toward which all creation, however unsteadily, moves.
And it is because of this, uh, omega point, that we do live in a cosmos.
And not a chaos.
Not simply a raging confusion.
But something that is structured and ordered.
Well, in spite of the fact that evolution was seeking to serve the most rigorous scientific desires to exclude teleology
and to exclude God from the process of the natural world, uh, it introduced a bizarre concept which cut against its own purposes.
The concept is a kind of progress in nature, where previously none had been.
So that, uh, from Aristotle to the 19th century, what you have as a theory of nature is what's called the great chain of being, or the great ladder of being.
And it stretches from God through the archangels, the serabim, the cherubim, down man, then the animal kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, so forth and so on.
But it is imagined as static, as put in place by the fiat looks of creation, set in place for all time.
What, what, uh, Darwin did was to see it as not a great chain of being, but as an escalator of being.
He added the notion of progressive movement toward higher and higher forms.
More and more complex manifestations of the, uh, intrinsic ingression of novelty into actual events.
And this idea is very, very interesting and cogent and pregnant with possibility for all of us and our world.
You see, what it is really is, it's a recasting of an idea that had been banished for several centuries from Western thinking.
It is the alchemical idea that nature is driving to perfect itself.
This was what the alchemists believed.
They believed that through time, uh, lesser metals became gold.
And that what the alchemist was trying to do was to compress time.
He was trying to, to catalyze a natural process so that what took thousands in their imagination of years in the body of the earth could be compressed into days or weeks in the alembic of the alchemists.
Well, as science defined itself in the, throughout the 17th and 18th century under the impetus of Descartes and, uh, and, uh, Kant and all of these people,
uh, this notion of, uh, the world as a distillate apparatus was given up.
But it returns in the idea of evolution and, uh, we inherit it in the social world.
Now, this is a delicate point.
There is something called social Darwinism, otherwise known as fascism.
Social Darwinism uses a very vulgar understanding of evolutionary dynamics to justify class oppression by saying that, uh, it must be right that some people have their foot on other people's necks.
Because isn't this what nature is about?
Struggle of the fittest and survival of the, the longest fang, the swiftest claw, the sharpest tooth?
Well, the answer is no, absolutely not.
This, this rests on an understanding of nature that was in vogue 150 years ago, that is not in vogue now.
That's what you see when you look at nature at the, at the, in the human dimension.
But when you analyze nature as, uh, an integrated system of chemical reactions, gene transfer, catalytic self-regulating activities, hyper-cycles of energy, nutrients and metabolism.
When you analyze nature from that point of view, you see that it seeks to maximize cooperation, connectedness.
Mutual interdependability is the thing which holds the whole thing together.
And the species that is most successful is not the species that can dominate all others.
It's the species that can make itself indispensable to all others.
Look at the, uh, evolutionary success of the bacteria.
You know, they settled in for the long haul.
And no higher form of life can operate without them.
And so the, uh, the possibility of, of bacteria becoming extinct is laughable.
I mean, they'll be the last to go because they have made themselves indispensable.
This idea then of evolution has strongly entered the human world.
And science hates this.
I had somebody once say to me, if it doesn't involve genes, it ain't evolution.
And you should not use the word evolution to describe progressive change.
They didn't like that.
They said evolution is a technical term used by biologists and it applies to genetic material only.
Books do not evolve.
Social systems do not evolve.
Corporations, relationships do not evolve.
This is a misuse of the word.
Well, since then, uh, evolutionary thinkers like C.H. Waddington, Eric Yonch, Wes Churchman, uh, Paul Feyerabend, uh, uh, Ervin Laszlo, have, uh, I think by the sheer force and volume of their writings overwhelmed this notion and reclaimed evolution as a much broader concept than it was understood.
than it was understood to be in the 19th century.
Evolution is now understood to be the triumphant march out of chaos into order, connectedness, self-expression, and self-reflection that begins with the first moments preceding, I mean, following the Big Bang.
In other words, we have, uh, chemical, we have atomic evolution, evolution of atomic systems as electrons settle down into stable orbits.
We have chemical evolution into more and more complex molecular forms which finally become polymers.
These polymers further evolve into complex, energetic systems capable of self-replication, motility, and eventually, you know, the writing of operas.
So what we see when we look at, uh, the universe is that you have to be blind to this progressive tendency that has worked its will with the random plasma of pure electrons,
with the chemistry of stars, with the molecular chemistry of primitive planets, with plant and animal life, with human epigenetic coding systems, carving, dance, ritual, vocalization, magic,
and this process proceeds right up into the 20th century with this phenomenon that we all, uh, give, uh, some credence to the notion that we are living in a period of compressed time.
Well, so what, what are we to do with that?
I think what we have to do is begin then to design this process.
It is now moving fast enough that it is within the, the ken of each one of us to see progressive consolidation of change taking place in the world around us.
We, as human beings, I think, are destined to be the design and control element in this thing, in this global Gaian process.
Never mind that we have done it so badly up to now, because now, meaning the 20th century, is a completely different kind of epistemic world
than any world that preceded it. And to the degree that we can shed the inherited behavior patterns of, uh, previous centuries, previous cultural styles,
and actually take hold of the tools present at hand, we can, uh, guide and control this evolutionary process.
Uh, culture as it is, in a sense, the, the software of the infrastructure of the global civilization, which is the hardware.
We don't need to make major design revisions in the hardware. The hardware is how we produce, uh, and move around food,
how we produce energy. The major restructuring there is simply a matter of cleaning it up, making it more efficient, less toxic,
less enslaved to the notion of making a buck, more enslaved to the notion of, uh, serving human needs.
So, the hardware structure can be, uh, pretty much redesigned along the lines that are clear to even the engineering mentalities among us.
What is not so clear is that culture can be redefined as software and radically rewritten so that it runs much more smoothly.
Uh, now notice that I did not say that we were software or hardware. We are neither. We are the user.
And this is the important thing to remember. We are not scripting ourselves into some kind of machine future.
We are designing the future that we want to have rather than allowing the blunders of our grandparents to dictate the kind of future we will have.
We are very late waking up to the necessity for this. This is because we tend to operate along very short-term, uh, goals.
It's very hard for us to put in place a project that, uh, looks 40 or 50, uh, years ahead.
It was interesting. A couple of years ago, there was an article in the Whole Earth Review about, uh, uh, a chapel at Oxford.
That, uh, that, uh, the, the main beam of this chapel, which was an oak beam about so by so, uh, was rotted through with worms and had to be replaced.
And it was no problem because 800 years ago, an English king planted an oak tree that was to be grown for the specific purpose of replacing this beam when it should need to be replaced.
And so this 750-year-old oak tree was cut and the beam hewn and put into place.
And, uh, the, it inspired them to plant another oak tree, which, uh, is not a bad idea.
Okay, well, um, so that's maybe enough about evolution. Now I want to talk about revolution, which is also in the solsticeal theme, because, uh, what the solstice marks is the return of the heliacal rising of the sun to a certain fixed star against the background of fixed stars in our calendar system.
What it really celebrates is, uh, the longest day of the year, the day when there is, when the sun makes its most northerly, uh, its deepest incursion into the northern latitudes.
It's interesting, the theme of revolution is dealt with in the I Ching, and since, of course, the I Ching was one of the five Confucian classics, you might turn to that passage expecting a discourse on political, uh, reformations.
And when you look at the hexagram revolution, it says, uh, nothing about political guidance to revolutionaries. It says instead, uh, the magician is a calendar maker.
He measures the seasons and he sets them right.
And, uh, and so the last idea, maybe, that I want to leave with you tonight is, uh, a few thoughts about the calendar, because, uh, I have fastened onto the calendar as an interesting vehicle for changing people's conceptions of reality.
I don't think we realize how thoroughly our worldview is dominated by the unconscious preconceptions that are, uh, built into our calendar.
The Chinese understood this. This is why when there were great social revolutions, a new calendar was always put in place.
We have used the present calendar with a minor correction, uh, for two thousand years, for one entire zodiacal age.
And, uh, we assume, I assume we assume, that we use this calendar that we do, because it must be a very good one.
And it must be the best of all. And it must be the simplest.
And it is true, that when you look back into time, you do find bizarre calendrical arrangements.
Uh, for instance, I don't know if you knew this, but Roman months counted up to the middle day of the month, and then, like a rocket launching, counted down to the end day of the month.
This is why the middle day of Roman months, which was called the Ides, was considered an unlucky day, because that was the day that the upward switched to a downward count.
Well, we would find this very clumsy.
But, notice that what our, the, the logic, and we've talked about logic, reason, and deduction, uh, this evening.
The logic behind our calendar is that it is a good solar calendar.
Well, what do we mean by a good solar calendar?
Well, uh, calendar makers will tell you that a good solar calendar is a calendar such that, uh,
on the same day of every year, the sun rises in the same place against the background of the fixed stars.
This is what we mean when we say the sun is in Aries.
We mean that at dawn, the constellation Aries is blotted out by the heliacal light of the rising sun.
But the sun is this solar, masculine, Apollonian archetype.
It is the archetype of the ego, as God.
It is the archetype of the center, the unity.
The solar calendar is set up so that we do not have what is called a precession.
A precession is where the days slip against the background of the fixed stars.
Our, the notion of our calendar is that it is an agricultural calendar,
and we want our great agricultural holidays to always fall in the times of harvest and planting.
So a solar year must be used.
But what this does is it has an underlying assumption which is false,
and which is, has been inculcated into our psychology with two detrimental ends.
And it is this, that this obsession with fixing the solstices and the equinoxes against the fixed stars,
is the effort to build a structure on the very largest level, the level of the planet itself,
to build a structure that is fixed, that is enduring.
And the great pride of our calendar is that we say it does not slip.
That means it's fixed and enduring.
Well, you may not know that the reason it doesn't slip is because there's a fudge factor in it.
We're all familiar with the fudge factor of leap year,
that every four years we have to add a year to keep it okay.
But how many of you knew that every century year divisible by 400 is also a leap year,
even if it occurs out of sequence?
The year 2000 will be such a leap year.
It is a century year divisible by 400.
So was 1600.
And so in that case you have a leap year even though the previous or the following year may be a leap year.
So there is a fudge factor in the high and mighty solar paternal calendar that keeps it on track.
Well, somewhat facetiously what I propose, at least as a thought model, is an entirely different year length.
384 days.
Now, 384 days is an interesting number.
It's 13 lunations.
Precisely 13 lunations.
And so we would have therefore a need for a 13th month in the calendar.
And I propose that the 13th month follow August and precede September and be called Remember.
And the month of Remember will be a month of great mnemonic celebration and recovery of the past.
It will be a celebration of the past.
Well, okay, now we have 13 months.
That's wonderful.
But we have purchased this 13th month at the expense of 19 days that overshoot the solar year.
What about that?
Well, instead of viewing that as a problem, as it has always been viewed, let's view it as an opportunity.
What happens if you use a day length 19 days longer than the solar year?
Well, it means that the great festivals of the solar year, Easter, Christmas, the 4th of July, will, let's call it Independence Day so we don't confuse ourselves because it's going to move, that these great festivals will do what is called precess.
Each year they will come 19 days later against the solar year than the year before.
So in such a calendrical system, you would be, as a child, Christmas would occur, let us say, in winter.
By the time you were in your middle teens, Christmas would be occurring in springtime.
By the time you were in your mid-twenties, Christmas would be occurring in high summer, and in your mid-thirties, it would occur again, it would occur in autumn.
And through a life of 60 or 70 years, the solar festivals would migrate through the seasons.
Well, this may seem trivial to you, and hey, it may be, but the psychology of it is that it's trying to build in, at the highest level, a truth which we have lost sight of.
Which is the idea that everything flows, that everything is impermanent.
That flux is the only standard.
Flux is the only thing you can depend on.
If we gave ourselves permission at the highest and deepest psychological level, the place where we measure time and the spectacle of our life as spread out against the grid of the history that we live through.
If we were to give that permission to be portrayed on a grid that emphasized flow, transience, change, and recursion, rather than this constipated solar square against the fixed stars, then what we are really doing, you see, is changing archetypes.
We are changing archetypes.
We are changing archetypes.
We are changing archetypes.
And what are we changing?
We are changing the Apollonian solar paternalistic dominator archetype for the feminine, oceanic, intuitive, giving and taking archetype of flow and life and death and completion through change, rather than completion through change.
We are changing the way to the feminine, which seeks to stave off change and then is inevitably swept away and therefore somehow touched with pathos.
Well, maybe that's enough.
Maybe there are questions.
This was somewhat meandering.
I'll recap it for you to try and give you the illusion that there was a plan.
We began by celebrating the solstice with an attack on reason and logic and in favor of the primacy of intuition in spite of its nakedness.
Intuition cannot clothe itself in the armor of logic.
But I hope I demonstrated to you that the armor of logic is wide mesh chain mail.
In fact, it's chicken wire.
In fact, it may be chicken shit.
So, the primacy of intuition and how that intuition led into a peculiar episode in 19th century science where committed atheists found themselves serving the recovery of the alchemical ideal through the notion of nature as an engine of telos and progressivism.
And then, from that, the notion of our own century as the concrescence of this teleological process that is leading everything into deeper and deeper modes of self-reflection and connectedness.
And then, finally, to put the snake's tail in its mouth to return to the theme of the solstice and to offer again a counterpose to the calendar of reason, the calendar of solar paternalism, to offer instead a potential calendar in celebration of flux, change, growth and feminism.
And then, finally, to offer again a couple of things that are going to offer.
And then, finally, we have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to be maximized if we are going to open a dialogue with our souls and the soul of the planet and save ourselves from the lethal momentum that so many hundreds of years of dominator culture have imparted to the machinery of our civilization.
I mean, we must awaken and these little probes, games about logic and calendars and shifting perspective on these various issues, this is just a way to promote cognitive activity.
To say, you know, the path out of the selva oscura, the path out of the dark wood in which we find ourselves is cognition, thought, getting smart fast.
We have to dance, we have to dance, calculate, and drum our way out of the circumstances into which we have fallen.
And to the degree that we can celebrate the irrational, the feminine, the unconscious, the transpersonal, and even the psychedelic, to the degree that we can celebrate these things,
we are giving permission for the order that is in nature to manifest, the plan wants to come to be, we have to get out of the way.
And what that means is all the tricks in the book to diminish ego, to diminish ego as a cultural ideal.
I mean, ego is not a male problem, it's not a yuppie problem, it's not a white people problem, it's just a problem.
And until we get this higher perspective, we are going to continue to rattle the bars of our cage.
The higher perspective depends on seeing things on a scale of thousands of years and potentially millions of light years.
A cosmic scale, a cosmic scale, the correct scale, the scale on which we are truly operating.
I mean, the minutia of our personal lives is that.
It's that our lives are an opening into a transpersonal opportunity, you know.
I mean, I've said this in my smaller class.
I take the notion of Tantra seriously, if by Tantra what we mean is the shortcut path.
That life is some kind of opportunity.
It's an opening between unbridgeable chasms of the unknown.
And yet, out of chaos, for 20, 40, 70 years, we come into a domain of immense opportunity.
It is a conundrum.
It is a puzzle.
It is something to be figured out.
And I have the faith that if we can figure this out, we can somehow not only make a better world for our children,
but in some other profound way, we can even undo what has been done.
And this would be the ultimate dream, that somehow we can discover an elegant escape
that will leave us with the clear understanding that the problem was an illusion.
It was an illusion.
It was the last illusion.
What is, in your position, is the effect of no myth?
What has happened to our society, do you think, by virtue of the fact that we have the obvious
cooperative evolutionary process about us everywhere, and yet we don't have a myth that fits it?
What will happen to us if we don't get a myth?
Well, we do have a myth.
We just don't call it that.
I mean, our myth is the Faustian myth that reason can wring the secrets from nature and thereby make man a god.
And this is the myth of modern science.
All of the alchemical dreams of the 16th century, transformation of matter, prolongation of life, so forth and so on,
have been achieved by 20th century science.
The problem is that our myth is a fatal one.
That's what I'm saying.
Where is a myth that fits the evolutionary concept?
I hear the calendar as a myth that would fit.
Yes, well, this is a...
What happens to us if we don't get one?
Well, what happens to us if we don't get one is we just drive this bicycle right over the cliff
in the next 40 or 50 years.
Because the myth that is trying to be born in science, and it has to be born there because that's the dominant church.
The myth that is trying to be born in science is the rebirth of the spirit.
The spirit has been banished from science and not that long.
Don't think that it's been that long.
As late as the early 20th century, there were people like Driesch in Germany who were embryologists,
who were looking at the morphogenesis of form, and they said there must be what they called the Ilan Vital.
There had to be a vital spark.
There had to be an indestructible something there.
Well, then, of course, DNA came along to explain that, no, no, it isn't that at all.
It's just these proteins are uncoded and so forth.
But spirit has never really died in certain branches of biology and psychology.
You see, there are problems for science.
The chief problem is this one, that I can hold out my hand,
that I can tell you that I'm going to close it, and that this happens.
What you see is mind over matter.
What you see is free will.
You see mind willing matter to behave, and it happens.
Within the confines of the body, paranormal activity appears to be going on.
Nobody, none of these hot shots can explain how you can conceive of turning your hand into a fist
and cause it to happen.
Right there is the defeat of 2,000 years of rational scientific philosophy.
And they just say, yes, that's right, but we make great fighter planes.
So, I see Rupert Sheldrake as very important in the process of building a new scientific myth.
Because what he is saying is, on one level, completely outlandish.
On another level, he completes a program that has been going on since the 1850s.
Tonight I talked about biology and evolution.
But there were parallel events in the 19th century going on in the field of the study of magnetism and electricity.
And people like Faraday and Helmholtz and James Clerk Maxwell were discovering fields.
Well, fields are extremely sort of metaphysical phenomena.
I mean, they are invisible.
They pervade all space.
They can't be seen, and yet instruments can be seen to detect them.
And not only that, we can transmit music and voice hundreds of miles.
Right now, this room is interpenetrated by hundreds and hundreds of long-distance telephone calls,
high-frequency radio transmissions, high-frequency television.
We see none of this if you had told someone in the 1850s that in the 20th century people would live in an ocean of invisible vibrational energy carrying messages over thousands of miles.
They would not have believed it.
Sheldrake is simply saying that the part of reality that science has hitherto been unable to account for is going to have to be accounted for by adding a field into the already allowed fields,
which are the electromagnetic field, basically, the electromagnetic spectrum.
Well, this field which Sheldrake wants to establish is called a morphogenetic field.
It means that somehow the history of this glass is attendant upon it.
The history of the glass has followed it here this evening, as has the history of the pillow and your history and your history,
and that we are in fact not, that the past is present in the present.
That in fact the present is somehow a cascade of effects coming out of the past,
not along the lines of causal declension, cause and effect, but also in this other way.
And I think that there's a lot to this, and I think that eventually Sheldrake will be heard,
as yet he's unable to stride to the blackboard and write the equations for the morphogenetic field.
But this could come in time, and when it does, it will elucidate the hidden dimension that so bedevils our understanding,
because it will explain why things are as they are.
That they are as they are, because they are a wave front out of the past,
meeting the boundary constraints of the present situation.
The whole, my own personal effort to restart a dialogue on the psychedelic issue,
is because I believe that psychology has reduced its field of expertise unnecessarily
by seeking to see everything as an adjunct to the functional or dysfunctional human personality.
In other words, we don't know what the mind is.
The notion that it arises out of the brain is something that the reductionists hypothesized with Sherrington in the 20s.
My God, they've had 60 years to make good on this, and they've gotten nowhere.
You know?
How long do you beat a hypothesis before you proclaim it a dead horse?
You know?
Same thing with molecular biology.
I mean, DNA was decoded in 1950, 35 years ago.
And, you know, has molecular biology taken a significant step since?
I mean, yes, I know about operons and all that stuff, but that's really the details.
No understanding of the mechanisms of life have emerged out of reductionist biology,
and no understandings of the mechanisms of mind, thought, and cognition have emerged out of reductionist psychology.
So, what we're going to have to admit, and this is a tough thing,
but this is what goes along with intellectual revolutions,
is the inadequacy of the present models.
And the paradigm reformers are in for big trouble,
because these paradigms can't be reformed.
These paradigms have to be junked.
It's junk.
It's worthless.
I mean, it's fine if you want to make fighter planes,
but what does that prove about your knowledge of the nature of being?
It doesn't prove anything.
It's just a cultural artifact.
So, I think the myth that is seeking to be born is the rebirth of the spirit.
And it's a strange thing, because we all feel it.
We all know it.
But we live in such a top-down ecology of knowledge,
that until Time Magazine proclaims the rebirth of the spirit,
nobody's going to cop to what's going on.
Yeah, intuition is this same kind of thing.
I mean, the feminine is the same thing.
I mean, I don't want to burden this group,
because you haven't stuck with me over days and days,
but what I'm saying in what I think of as course,
is that we had a symbiotic relationship
as recently as 20,000 years ago
with a vegetable mind,
an organized entelechy,
a goddess, a spirit,
whatever you want to call it,
a mind that was brutally truncated.
Our symbiotic relationship was brutally truncated
by climatological and historical factors
that caused us to fall from that state of grace,
ecological balance, symbiosis,
into, you know,
the wandering herd of car thieves that we are.
And our own we,
our existential discomfort,
our angst,
is a product
of this severing of our relationship to spirit.
We are the children of a dysfunctional relationship
that we have to bring to the surface.
And, you know,
if you are what I imagine an ordinary person,
this will begin to sound,
this will start out sounding preposterous,
begin sounding menacing,
and I hope end up convincing you.
We are worthless
without a stabilizing umbilical connection
to the mind at large in nature.
And the way we have always achieved this
is through shamanism,
natural magic,
and ecstasy.
This is, in fact,
what ecstasy is.
Ecstasy is being in the presence
of the other.
And the other is not
a philosophical hypothesization
or a, uh,
somebody's notion.
The other
is
the thing we share this planet with.
That we,
we as a culture,
have not glimpsed for a thousand years
because we've retreated into walled cities
and walled languages
and walled idea systems.
We nowhere come tangential
to the flesh of the earth.
When we do,
alone,
in the wilderness,
uh,
then it overwhelms us.
It moves us.
It terrifies us
because we have been
so long
away from it.
So,
this is what
the reclamation
is about.
The spirit
is not some
airy-fairy notion
floating above everything.
I mean,
the,
the spirit
is something
which,
when it enters
into your,
uh,
cross-section
of reality,
it leaves your knees
knocking
and your heart
pounding.
I mean,
the,
the path
with heart
is the path
that astonishes.
And that,
uh,
that sense
of astonishment
can only come
from an other,
from,
uh,
a lover
or an other.
It cannot come
out of the self.
So,
is the,
other questions
on all of this.
Your,
section where you're
covered in evolution,
you see,
you imply that
this was the time
to really take some,
um,
intention with respect
to the direction
of our evolution.
And I wonder
if maybe that's
just an illusion
whose time has come.
And it's part
of the illusion
of separateness.
And the process
will go on
and is this part
of the,
the process
to have the illusion
that we actually
replayed it?
Well,
we won't know
till we try.
But what we have
very,
very suddenly,
almost overnight,
put in place
is,
number one,
an entirely
global system
for collecting
information
about reality
and ourselves.
We never had
this before.
We didn't even
have it
30 years ago.
Uh,
now you can
find out
what's going on.
You can go
if necessary,
anywhere you need
to go.
Within 72 hours,
you can be
on the ground,
almost anywhere
on Earth
checking out
what's going on.
In the meantime,
uh,
anthropological data,
sociological data,
climatological data,
demographic data,
political data,
defense strategy data,
all of this stuff
is available.
We now know
at least
what cards
are in play.
And this is
the first time
this has been so.
We are now
a global culture,
you know,
from the rainforests
of the Amazon
to the wastes
of the Kalahari
from Nome
to Santiago.
It's one family,
one people.
A,
a,
a nuclear power
explosion
that happens
in the Western
Soviet Union
is measured
two weeks later
in Johannesburg
and everywhere
else on the planet.
So,
I think we are
living under
extraordinary conditions,
that there are
opportunities in place.
The other thing is,
you know,
we are connecting
nine million computers
a month
are being connected
together.
Now,
people think
that computers
are office machines,
but
all of our technology
is an excretion
of the imagination.
All of our technology
is the condensation
of ideological intention.
And the fact
that we now
have turned
our attention
to information,
the true stuff
of reality
is a hopeful sign.
For three centuries,
we've been obsessed
with matter.
We thought that
was the true stuff
of reality.
Well,
it turns out
that's just,
you know,
nonsense.
A flawed,
philosophical premise
gave us
this bias
in favor
of materialism.
But with information,
changes
can really
be made.
And also,
information
informs people.
I'm very much
enamored
of the notion
of the meme.
A meme
is the smallest
unit
of an idea.
It is to ideas
what genes
are to proteins.
Genes make proteins.
Memes
make ideas.
And
the way you
encourage a meme
is the way
you encourage
a protein.
You replicate it.
There are two ways
of replicating memes.
you can tell
somebody
and they
will tell
somebody.
Or you can
tell two people.
You can repeat
yourself.
Or you can tell
a bunch of people.
And the idea
is that
we are now,
the global
meme pool
is now
in place.
All ideas
are in competition.
And
it's a level
playing field.
This is,
to my mind,
what accounts
for the overnight
evaporation
of Marxism.
This was a meme
which could not
survive
on a level
playing field.
When the
playing field
was leveled,
meaning when
a free press
was allowed,
that was it
for that meme.
That was like,
you know,
trying to sell
flying pigs
in Brooklyn.
Just,
people are
too smart.
so it's not
going to happen.
So,
I believe then
that memes
compete with
each other
and that the
best ones
are the ones
which rise
to the top.
I have a real
faith that
ideology
in this case
will mirror
biology
and that
more and more
complex
and well-adapted
and efficient
and co-adaptive
and mutually
self-reinforcing
and mutual
community
feedback
and all of
these things
that the
memes which
support,
which maximize
these evolutionary
goals,
will fall
naturally
into place.
And so,
this thing
which happened
in China
was a struggle
about the
meme
meme
because
democracy
is the
idea
that gives
permission
for all
the memes
to compete.
I mean,
democracy
is very close
to the heart
of any
anarchist.
You know,
Plato said,
you can always
tell a democracy
when you approach
them from the
sea because
unchained dogs
run on the
wharf.
Well,
what he was
referring to
was the
chaos and
the disorder
of democracies.
So,
releasing memes
into a
competitive
environment
is very
important.
Every government
on earth,
no matter
what a bunch
of repressive
totalitarian
militaristic
clowns
they may
actually be,
they have
to give
lip service
to the
idea that
they support
a free
press
and free
exchange
of
information
and so
forth and
so on.
The battle
over that
has been won.
Now it's
about how we
interpret what
we call
victory.
Nevertheless,
as the
little people
in the
world,
I think
it behooves
all of us
to seek
to promote
this process
wherever
possible.
if you
have a
good idea
say it
for God's
sake
say it
I mean
we're
drowning
for lack
of good
ideas
we need
every good
idea we
can get
if the
future is
not going
to be made
of good
ideas
it's going
to be made
of bad
ideas
and we've
seen
enough
of what
that can
bring.
History
is a
digression
history
is the
briefest
of all
natural
phenomena
it began
10-15
thousand
years ago
and appears
as though
it will
quench
itself
within
500
years
it is
obviously
a self
funneling
process
that digs
its walls
higher and
higher
because it
is going
towards some
kind of
transcendence
it is a
metamorphosis
it is not
a steady
state
history
is some
kind of
process
balanced
on a
pinnacle
and it
either goes
back I
suppose
into
speechless
animal
organization
if we
blow up
the world
or
it
turns into
something else
but it is not
something to be
maintained
it is
transitory
and designed
to be so
it's like a
birth
it's a
pro
it's
it tears
the planet
apart
it contorts
the people
undergoing it
it
you know
before it's
over
the heavy
metals are
ripped out
of the
surface of
the earth
the forests
are cut
down
this thing
happens
and then
let us hope
it is
over
and we
and we go
to some
less
materialistic
less destructive
phase
this is
this is
why
you know
the question
that the
psychedelics
raise
for each
of us
as individuals
is the
question
that
the culture
is going
to have
to answer
collectively
in time
as well
it is
what are
we
when we
can be
anything
we can
imagine
I don't
know
I think
we are
surrounded
by mystery
I think
the
psychedelics
because they
enlarge
the dimension
of mind
they bring
the mystery
in close
they allow
us to
contemplate
possibilities
that we would
never have
contemplated
because they
give us
the power
of the
imagination
and the
data
how can
we
take
these new
datum
that enter
experience
and integrate
them
meaningfully
into
ourselves
well
I think
that
the way
you do
this
is by
realizing
that
the drama
that is
unfolding
must be
a human
drama
so for
instance
the
entities
that are
glimpsed
in these
exotic
psychedelic
states
that inform
the shamans
and so
forth
we
say
it's
another
dimension
and we
hypothesize
then
that these
are
extraterrestrials
or demons
or
plant
spirits
we never
face
the
fact
that
to
redeem
our own
anxiety
they have
to be
something
more
than plant
spirits
they have
to be
something
more
than
demons
they have
to be
something
more
than
friendly
extraterrestrials
my own
private
opinion
about this
is I
think
that
what
psychedelics
in these
high dose
correct
set
setting
situations
carry us
into
is an
ecology
of souls
this
is what
we're
seeing
I mean
if that's
not a
shocking
enough way
of putting
it
how about
this
what we're
seeing
is
the dead
those
people
those
things
in that
place
are
our
ancestors
it's as
though there
is an
ecology
and a
cycle
of energy
that reaches
beyond
visible
life
there is
an ecology
of many
dimensions
that life
is
transformation
into a
transcendental
realm
that those
self
transforming
jeweled
elf
machines
that are
manufacturing
the talking
Faberg√©
eggs
and the
liquid
crystal
lattices
of
multiple
fractal
dimensions
those
are
dead
friends
these
places
lie
just
over the
hill
this
is
what
is
meant
when it's
said
that
shamans
know
how to
pass
through
the doors
that the
dead
pass
through
daily
that
the
adventure
of being
I think
is not
going to
stop
with
saving
the
rainforest
or
feeding
everybody
or going
off
to our
tourists
that
the
adventure
of being
persists
through
time
this
would
explain
the
freakish
immediacy
and
the
weirdness
the
charge
the
numinosity
of the
contact
in
hyperspace
if this
is an
ecology
of
souls
if
what we
are
seeing
is
in fact
what we
always
thought
we would
never
see
or
know
which
is
information
about
the
next
stage
of
existence
then
this
is
a
tremendous
salutary
force
pouring
into
existence
and
when
you
think
about
it
isn't
this
the
most
likely
hypothesis
we
know
how
improbable
extraterrestrials
are
and
the
only
organized
intellect
we
have
ever
contacted
or
had
familiarity
with
are
people
therefore
isn't
it
likely
that
what
we're
dealing
with
are
people
well
then
hypotheses
multiply
perhaps
they're
people
from
the
future
perhaps
that's
the
future
and
then
we
like
that
because
it
holds
everything
in
the
dimensions
we're
familiar
with
the
idea
that
it's
the
dead
is
a
little
more
hackle
raising
a
little
more
peculiar
a
little
more
heartful
a
little
more
hard
to
assimilate
and
probably
closer
to
the
mark
that
it
is
an
ecology
of
souls
that's
where
we
go
that's
why
they
can
make
objects
out of
language
it's
because
it is
the
flesh
becoming
word
and
then
the
word
becoming
flesh
that
this
is
a
cycle
between
two
dimensions
of
existence
and
only
the
shamans
know
what
is
happening
because
only
they
operate
outside
the
confines
of
profane
history
only
they
make
the
journey
into
the
matrix
where
for
some
reason
the
living
and the
dead
are
co
existent
well
this
you
know
just
seems
like
raving
madness
except
that
this
is
what
every
anthropologist
has
collected
in his
notebooks
from
every
preliterate
group
worldwide
they're
into
the
ancestors
not
extraterrestrials
not
voyagers
from the
far
future
but
the
dead
and
it
is
it
has
the
ring
of
truth
to
me
this
would
explain
this
intuition
that
the
psychedelics
somehow
have
a
historical
role
to
play
because
deny
it
as we
may
wish
to
we
are
in
a
great
dying
it
is
well
advanced
so
then
you
know
there's
this
sobering
realization
that
my
God
what
we
feared
most
is
possibly
about
to
happen
well
then
if
we
believe
in
the
Tao
if
we
believe
in
the
unobstructed
unfolding
of things
from the
first
moments
of the
universe
then
what
we
have
to
do
is
take
hold
and
face
the
music
and
I
don't
think
it's
that
bad
but
I
think
there's
a
hard
swallow
in
the
transition
there is
a
leap
into
this
other
possibility
so
it
is
not
simply
an
opportunity
for
a
political
revolution
or a
social
revolution
or an
ecological
revolution
it's all
that
it's
much
more
it has
to do
with
deconstructing
the
dualism
of life
and death
itself
and
creating
the
ontos
of a
new
reality
that is
based on
the
presence
of
eternity
that's
what
eternity
is
eternity
is the
present
at hand
hyperdimensionally
beheld
and it
is found
to be
a
domain
of
magic
and
caring
and
mystery
that
mingles
life
and death
as
the
only
possible
way
of
overcoming
the
contradiction
it
has
always
in
hindsight
appalled
me
as
I
when
I
go
into
the
truly
deep
psychedelic
places
how
casual
one
becomes
about
death
not
that
you
seek
it
but
that
it
seems
almost
a
trivial
issue
because
these
two
things
are
seen
to
be
all
of
a
piece
there
is
continuity
but
there
is
astonishment
we
do
not
recognize
ourselves
the
shaman
alone
has
the
privileged
vantage
point
to
know
what
he
beholds
and
I
think
that's
how
we
define
where
we
are
on
the
shamanic
path
do
you
know
what
you
behold
I
mean
some
people
come
down
and
say
pretty
pictures
other
people
come
down
and
say
dancing
mice
hieroglyphs
do
we
know
what
we
behold
we
need
to
know
what
we
behold
because
inevitably
we
become
what
we
behold
we
we
we
we
we
we
