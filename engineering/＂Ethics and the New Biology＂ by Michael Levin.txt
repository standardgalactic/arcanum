All right, thank you so much.
This is really fun.
I've not given a talk specifically on this topic,
but I take it very seriously
and I think about it all the time.
So let's try it and see how it goes.
If you want to follow up on any of the science here,
this is my official lab webpage that has all the papers,
the data sets, the software, all that stuff.
And then this is my personal blog
with some kind of somewhat crazier version
of what I think all of these things mean and so on.
So what I'd like to do today
is first just give you a quick outline
of what I'm going to do,
the kind of the journey I'm gonna take you on.
I'm gonna try in the next 25 minutes
to take you through a few different things.
And fundamental to ethics is I think this question
of what should I do next?
And I think fundamental to that
is the question of what am I really
and how do I relate to the outside world?
And this is a lot of what we do,
even though we have a wet lab,
a large wet lab where we do all kinds of work
on cancer and bioengineering and so on.
But I think fundamentally,
this is the sort of thing that we actually work on.
So I'm gonna talk to you about this idea
that we are all a kind of collective intelligence.
In fact, I'm gonna try to show you,
and again, hard in 25 minutes,
but I'll at least show you a few examples,
why I think really the world consists of intelligence
all the way down, okay?
Not just brainy mammals and birds and things like that,
but all the way down.
The implications of that, amazingly enough,
are that we can reach all kinds of interesting
new biomedicine if we understand how intelligence
is implemented in our bodies.
And so that gives all kinds of opportunities.
There are always in a discussion of ethics,
I'm sure somebody will be interested in the risks.
So I'm not going to do a lot on that in the main talk,
but if you wanna ask me questions about it later,
it's the kind of the most common thing that comes up.
So I'd rather talk about some of the more unusual things.
One thing that I wanna be very clear on
with respect to evaluating risk in science
is that we really have to think about the opportunity cost.
In other words, lots of people approach risk
in scientific discovery with a kind of an unspoken assumption
that everything is great now,
and you scientists better not screw it up.
In other words, don't do anything
that makes the situation worse.
That's a lot of these discussions come from that place.
But actually, you probably know,
things are absolutely not great.
There is incredible biomedical suffering out there.
I'm not a clinician, I'm not an MD,
but I get emails, probably a dozen emails per day
from people in the most unbelievable extremes
of pain and infirmity and disease and whatever.
And so it's really hard for young, healthy people
to realize what we're actually talking about here.
And so I think, yeah,
we absolutely have to think about the risks,
but we also have to think about the ethical imperative
to do something to help the situation.
And I actually think it is a kind of moral cowardice
to sort of leave it alone and say, not my problem,
I'm just gonna sit back and try not to make things worse.
I think that's not the right way to go.
And also, of course, there's issues with the environment
and so on.
Past the biomedical kinds of things,
I'm going to talk about this notion of freedom of embodiment,
because after we learn to fix all of the issues of the body
towards the normal standard complement of form and function,
then you realize that you can use the exact same tools
to actually create any kind of embodiment that you want.
And so this is something, of course,
that we can think about in any discussion of ethics.
And then towards the end,
I'm going to talk about just the bigger picture
of how that leads to a huge variety of unconventional beings
with which we are going to share our world
and already share our world
and what we owe to these beings that,
and so that kind of brings us back full circle, right?
You can see this is kind of really a cycle,
even though I've listed it linearly.
So the first thing we need to think about is,
well, what are all the beings that are relevant to ethics?
And so when we see something like this,
so here's a kind of Oscar winning performance here,
this little squirrel knows exactly what's going on.
She's gonna put the thing on the neck.
Ah, look, it's had a terrible accident.
It's even gonna look to see if the humans are watching
to make sure that, see, are you guys looking?
Look, I've had a terrible accident.
And so when we see something like this,
it's very obvious that this is something
that has intelligence,
that this is something that has preferences,
that it has a theory of mind,
and so that we have to be kind to things like this.
And it's obvious to us because it functions
on the same scale of space and time.
It operates in the same space as we do
in three dimensional space.
It has somewhat similar goals to us
in terms of survival and physiological integrity
and so on.
So this is easy,
but actually it gets much more complicated
because, and I'll just use an example
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Back in the day,
there were phenomena such as lightning
and static electricity and magnets and light
and all kinds of things.
And until we had a proper theory of electromagnetism,
we had no idea that all of these
were actually the same thing.
Okay, we thought they were disparate phenomena.
And what a proper theory of electricity
and electromagnetism did for us
is that it allowed us to say, first of all,
that actually all of these things are manifestations
of the same underlying phenomenon.
That phenomenon is continuous.
In other words, it's a spectrum.
It's not a set of discrete things,
even though we like to cut it up into regions
just for convenience, it's actually a spectrum.
And most importantly,
that we are natively,
because of our evolutionary history,
we are only sensitive to a tiny part of that spectrum.
All of this stuff,
we had no idea that all of this stuff existed
until that theory enabled technology
that now with the technological appliances
and the theory behind them,
enable us to recognize and make use of
all kinds of other phenomena in our universe
to which we were completely blind.
So I'm going to make the claim that we have,
as humans, we have a significant amount of mind blindness.
We're reasonably good at recognizing things like this.
And so lots of people study birds and primates
and maybe a whale or an octopus or things like this.
But there are all kinds of other creatures.
And one of the things that I try to do in my group
is to develop a framework
that allows us to think about diverse intelligences.
So all kinds of weird colonial organisms
and engineered new life forms
that have never existed before.
I'm going to show you some today.
Artificial intelligence,
whether purely software or robotic,
maybe someday aliens,
and even really exotic things
that don't look like beings at all,
such as patterns, actually,
active patterns with the media.
And so that spectrum,
instead of the electromagnetic spectrum,
what we have here is a spectrum of agency, okay?
And we could talk about this for the longest time,
but fundamentally what we have
is some kind of a gradual continuum
where a passive matter,
if there even is such a thing,
slowly scales up its cognitive capacities
to eventually become something like a metacognitive human
or whatever is beyond that.
And so this is what we work on.
If you're interested,
this paper has a lot of the details.
And I think this is not just a philosophical task
because as we have shown,
if you do this well,
it leads to new biomedical and bioengineering advances.
So it actually drives new science.
And I think really, really critical,
it's actually going to lead to better ethics.
And so another way to think about this
is that if you know the history of numbers,
first we had some counting numbers
and then somebody invented zero
and then we had some negative numbers
and then we had the rationals
and then somebody realized that that wasn't enough
and then we needed the irrationals and so on.
And each of these expansions
of what we understand as number broke prior concepts
as far as what defines the set of numbers,
it required a conceptual leap to get there
and to expand our understanding.
And it was actually quite stressful for everybody.
I mean, people died over this discovery
that the rational numbers weren't all there is.
A lot of people were killed, people committed suicide.
It was really fundamental.
And I think what we have here,
and I'm not gonna get through,
I may not even get to touch this,
but I'm gonna go through trying to gradually enlarge
the set of things that I think are on the spectrum
with us as being cognitive beings
that are relevant to questions of ethics.
And the first thing is that, you know,
in standard philosophy of mind
or just philosophy textbooks in general,
what you'll see is they talk about the human.
Humans do this and they do that
and they have for the ability to imagine things
and have moral worth and whatever.
And so they have this beautiful agential glow about them
that makes them important as moral actors.
But we know that we stand at the center of this continuum,
both on an evolutionary and developmental timescale,
where we started life as a single cell
and whatever was the origin before that.
And so this too is a set of slow changes
and whatever you think,
whatever philosophical properties this human has,
you have to have some story
of what happened in the previous stages.
Like how did we get here?
And, you know, is it gradual?
Is it discreet?
You know, what's going on?
And as I'm going to point out in a minute,
this is not enough.
There's another spectrum that we are at the center of,
which is the set of biological and technological changes
that again, slowly and gradually could move us
beyond what this is.
And then again, you have to ask yourself,
you know, where does this agential glow peter out?
And then you don't have to worry about these things anymore
or does it ever and things like that.
So here's how we all enter the world.
We start life as a little blob of chemistry and physics.
It's a little unfertilized oocyte.
Then there's this incredibly magical process
called embryogenesis where slowly and gradually
there's never a magic lightning flash
that takes you from physics to the land of psychology.
But what happens is eventually you become one of these beings
that are susceptible to the tools of behavioral science
or maybe even psychoanalysis, you know,
and something like this.
And so the story of our origin
is really the story of scaling up of cognition
and transformation.
It's really, you know, as scientists and philosophers,
we need to understand this transformative process
of how mind emerges from these simpler components.
And in fact, if you look at an early embryonic blastoderm,
there might be, you know, a couple of hundred thousand cells
at some particular stage.
And you look at that and you say,
well, there's one embryo, there's an embryo.
And when you say it's an embryo, what are you counting?
What is there one of?
I mean, there's hundreds of thousands or millions of cells.
What is there one of?
Well, it turns out that the best thing you could say
is that what there is one of is commitment
to a particular story.
In other words, alignment towards a specific journey
in anatomical space,
and the anatomical space being just the space
of all possible configurations that a body might take.
And that all of these cells agree,
they all share the same,
they've bought into the same model
of where they're going to go in anatomical space.
And then they make this one embryo.
That's what you're counting.
You're counting commitment to a model.
And if you make little scratches in this blastoderm,
then each one of these islands is going to do the same
because it's unaware of the presence of the others.
Eventually, it might heal up or it might not.
But basically, then you get twins and triplets and so on.
And so what you see here is the question
of how many individuals are inside this excitable medium
is not known in advance.
It's not set by the genetics.
It could be anywhere from zero
to probably half a dozen or more.
And there are potentially multiple different cognitive beings
that come out of this
because of this process of differentiation.
Where do I end and the outside world begins, right?
That's what's happening here.
And that, of course, has lots of parallels
to issues of individuation and dissociation
in the cognitive sphere.
So split brain patients whose left and right hemispheres
don't communicate very well.
Dissociative identity disorders.
We have multiple personalities on the same brain hardware
and so on.
So you're already starting to see
that it's not at all as simple.
Our origin and the underlying mechanisms
are not what is commonly portrayed
in philosophical discussions of humans
and our ethical duties and so on.
This is the sort of thing we're made from.
Now, this happens to be a free-living one
called the lacrimaria.
But this is a single cell.
And it has no brain, no nervous system,
very competent in all of its local little goals.
This is what we're made of.
You can already see that it has some ability
to manage its business at this lower scale.
In fact, even below that level,
the molecular networks inside of that little creature,
in fact, inside of all of us,
are molecular networks that are capable
of six different kinds of learning.
So different kinds of memory,
including Pavlovian conditioning.
So the material that you're made of
all the way down to the molecular level
has, and probably below that,
we could talk about that,
has certain behavioral properties
that you would easily recognize
as aspects of cognition.
And we're taking advantage of that
for all kinds of biomedical purposes in our lab
to try to train these biochemical networks
for drug conditioning and things like that.
And so life exerts intelligence in lots of spaces,
not just the three-dimensional space
where it's easy for us to recognize,
things like these crows that have learned
to exchange cigarette butts for treats.
But it operates in many spaces.
It operates in the space of gene expression.
It operates in the space of physiological states.
And it operates in anatomical morphous space,
which is, again, the space of shape configurations.
And this is the one we'll talk about today.
And when I say life operates in these spaces,
I mean that it navigates those spaces adaptively
to solve problems,
just like conventional animals that you're used to
navigate a three-dimensional space to solve problems.
I'll give you just one simple example
of what I mean by that.
This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule in a newt.
And you can see it's got a lumen in the middle,
and then you've got these eight to 10 cells
that work together.
If you make a newt embryos
with multiple copies of their genome,
the cells will get bigger
to accommodate the additional genetic material.
Oddly, the newt stays the same size.
And you say, well, how could that be?
And that's because while the cells are bigger,
what they do is they adjust,
and fewer of them are now making the exact same structure.
Until you make a newt with so many copies of their genome
that the cells become gigantic.
And instead of many cells working together to build this,
one single cell will bend around itself
and leave a hole in the middle.
This is a different molecular mechanisms.
So what you have here are a bunch of cells
that are using different affordances,
different genetically specified affordances,
meaning different mechanisms that they have,
to get the job done
in the face of incredibly weird circumstances.
If you're a newt coming into this world,
you can't count on the outer environment,
of course, things will change,
but you can't even count on your own parts.
You don't even know how many copies
of your genetic material you're going to have.
You don't know what the size of your cells are going to be.
You don't know what the number of your cells are going to be.
You have to reach that region of anatomical morpher space
with various new tricks using the tools you have
despite all these novelties.
That is a standard version of intelligence.
That is how they measure IQ tests.
They'll say, you've got these parts.
Now creatively use them to solve this problem
you've never seen before.
This is a system that does that,
but not in 3D space.
It does it in anatomical space.
And it means the fact that the living material
has this kind of beginner's mind aspect to it
where it does not assume,
in fact, at least most organisms
do not assume that everything's going to go
the way that it used to go for its ancestors.
They have this ability to creatively
use their genome and its products to solve problems.
That means that not only can they do things like this,
they can also do things like this.
Here's a tadpole.
So here's the mouth, the nostrils, the brain,
the spinal cord here.
What we've done is prevent the primary eyes from forming,
but we did put an eye on its tail
and we found that these animals can see quite well.
How do we know?
We built a device that trains them
in visual behavioral tasks and they can see.
Now, this is kind of shocking.
Why don't these animals,
where the eye does not connect to the brain,
so here the eye makes an optic nerve,
that optic nerve might synapse onto the spinal cord,
it might go to the gut,
it might go nowhere at all.
Why does this work out of the box?
How come you don't need rounds of evolutionary mutation,
selection, adaptation, all that stuff
to accommodate this completely novel
sensory motor architecture?
Why does this work out of the box?
And so, and it's because of that plasticity
that I told you a minute ago,
because evolution does not make fixed solutions
to fixed environments,
it makes problem-solving agents.
It's that these cells never assumed
the tadpole was gonna be the same all the time anyway.
It's gonna, they figure out a way to make it work.
And one way they do that,
and so you understand,
I'm using this example of cells
navigating anatomical space as a case study
or a model of an unconventional intelligence.
We don't have any aliens,
but we do have intelligences
that live in very different problem spaces,
and we can use that as a way to start understanding
how do we communicate,
how do we detect intelligence?
And so I showed you some ways of doing that.
You sort of make perturbations
and you notice they can get to the same goal
by different means.
So that's William James's definition of intelligence.
Okay, so we've detected them.
What's the next step?
Well, how do we communicate with them?
If we're going to have a relationship
with these intelligences,
how do we communicate with them?
Well, we discovered
that a very important kind of communication with them
can take place through the bioelectric interface.
Just like you and I are now communicating
through the bioelectrical interface
of your nervous system, okay,
of your retina and your auditory stream
and your nervous system.
Turns out this is also a very good way
to communicate with the cellular intelligence of your body.
So what we've developed are tools
that let us see the electrical signals
moving between all of the components
of this collective intelligence.
So this is just like neuroscientists do in the brain,
except we can now do this anywhere in the body.
So the colors indicate voltage levels.
Here's a bunch of cells in the dish.
This is an early frog embryo.
And now what we can do
is we can read the mind of the body.
By reading these electrical signals,
we can try to interpret them
and then try to understand
what are the memories,
the preferences, the goals,
and so on of this new collective intelligence.
We now have a way to also write information.
We don't use electric fields or waves
or frequencies or anything like that.
We manipulate the interface
that the cells are normally using
to control each other.
So that means ion channels
and electrical synapses known as gap junction,
just like in neuroscience.
So this is the communication interface that we hack.
If you do this,
you can do some interesting things.
First of all,
you can shift the border of the self of an agent.
So just to explain what I mean,
this single cell that I've shown you before
has very tiny goals.
All of its goals are,
in terms of space-time kind of a radius,
the cognitive light cone is very small,
both in space and time.
But when they get together,
these cells can pursue really grandiose goals.
So here's the limb of a salamander.
If you amputate that limb anywhere here,
the cells will rapidly build
and then they stop when it's done.
So their goal,
the goal of the collective is to build this thing.
And you know it's a goal
because if you deviate them from that goal,
they will work really hard,
they will achieve it,
and then they will stop.
So no individual cell knows what a finger is
or how many fingers you're supposed to have,
but the collective absolutely does.
As you can see here,
it's very reliable.
So the scale of the goals,
the border between self and world
has grown huge.
The self is gigantic here.
The self is very tiny here.
But that process can break down.
So here's human glioblastoma cells.
And these are cancer cells
that are basically disconnected electrically
from the collective.
And at that point,
they're back to their unicellular lifestyle.
They just can't remember the large-scale goal
of building a nice brain or anything else.
And so once you understand that,
you can actually control
that electrical connection between cells
and force a larger cognitive light cone
onto the system.
So here's a human oncogene
injected into this tadpole.
It will make a tumor.
The tumor has this really weird electrical state
where you can see the cells
are actually disconnecting
from their neighbors.
But if you prevent them from doing that,
even though that oncoprotein
is blazingly expressed,
it's the same animal.
So there's tons of that nasty oncogene.
There's no tumor
because what you've done
is kept the cells connected to the neighbors.
So they're part of this mind meld
of building nice skin,
nice muscle, and so on.
So the cancer cells
aren't more selfish.
They have smaller cells.
The border between self and world
has shrunk,
and we've reinflated again.
So that's one thing you can do
through this interface
is you can sort of play
with the border
between self and world.
Of course,
we can communicate certain goals
now that we understand
a little bit about
how they think
we can communicate certain goals.
Here's one thing we can do
is to tell a frog,
frogs don't regenerate their legs,
unlike that salamander
that I showed you.
We can tell these cells here
to go down the leg-building path
instead of the scarring path.
And so by 45 days,
then you already have
some toes,
you've got a toenail,
and eventually
a very respectable-looking
functional leg.
And we did that
by providing specific
ion-channel drugs
at this interface
to put the cells
in an electrical state
where they remember
that they need to build a limb
as opposed to scarring and stopping.
We are currently doing this,
and so I have to do a disclosure
because this is a company
that was spun out of our lab
with David Kaplan
to do this in mammals
and hopefully someday humans.
So this is one of those
biomedical applications.
So that first application
I just showed you
was about cancer.
So the idea was
to normalize the cells,
reconnect them to the body,
not kill them
with toxic chemotherapy,
not try to fix the genetics,
but to normalize them
by reconnecting them
to the memories of the body.
This is now a second application
around limb and organ regeneration,
so using electrical cues
to tell cells
to rebuild the things
they already know how to rebuild.
It's not just about rebuilding
the exact thing
in the right place.
You can also do
interesting things like this.
We can tell a bunch of cells
that would have been gut.
We can say,
no, instead you should make an eye.
And the way we do that
is we inject some ion channel RNA
that establishes
a bioelectrical signal,
and that tells the cells
to build an eye,
and they build an eye.
And that eye has
all the same lens, retina,
optic nerve,
all the stuff it's supposed to have.
And it has some other
interesting properties
that I don't have time
to talk about.
But the idea is,
much like when I'm talking
to you now,
I don't need to worry
about reaching into your brain
and changing all the
synaptic structures
in your brain
to make sure you remember
what I've told you.
You do that on your own.
I'm only providing
a very kind of thin stimulus,
and you do all the hard work
of managing
the underlying biochemistry
in your brain
to form memories,
make decisions,
and so on.
Same thing here.
We are not telling
the cells what to do.
We are not talking
to the genes
or the stem cells.
We provide a very
high-level signal.
Build an eye.
That's it.
The system,
being a good
multi-scale cognitive system,
it then takes that
and does all of the
underlying biochemistry
that's needed
to implement the message
that we've given them.
So once you see all this,
you realize that
what we eventually
are going to have
is something that I call
the anatomical compiler.
In other words,
once you understand
how to tell groups of cells
what to build,
then you get to move
from just from repair
to freedom of embodiment
because then
you are going to be able
to sit down
and draw any kind
of a plant,
animal, organ,
biobot, whatever,
and the system
should be able
to compile it
into a set of stimuli
that would be given
to cells
to get them to build
exactly whatever
you want it to build.
And so, yes,
it will,
if we had that,
which we don't yet,
but eventually we will,
and if we have that,
you could,
all of this would go away,
right?
So birth defects,
traumatic injury,
cancer, aging,
degenerative disease,
all of that
will disappear
once we know
how to tell cells
exactly what to build.
It's a communication problem.
It's not 3D printing.
It's not gene editing.
It's a translator.
What you need
is a translator interface
from our goal
to that of the,
to the agential material
of life.
But you realize now
that this means
that you don't,
you just have to stick
to the standard human shape.
If somebody decides that,
you know what,
I'd like to have
a couple of extra arms
and maybe an eye
on the back of the head
and maybe it should be
infrared sensitive
and whatever,
all of that should be
completely possible.
So much like
we augment ourselves now
with toothbrushes
and antibiotics
and education
and glasses
and crutches
and working out
and clothes
and all of this kind
of stuff
that we use now
to go beyond
our kind of
quote-unquote
natural state.
In the future,
you're going to be able
to do that
even more so biologically
and I think,
I think the beings
of the future
and I don't think
it's a very far future.
I think it's,
it's not that far off
are going to look back
and think it is
completely unimaginable
that people in our day
had to,
had to live their whole life
in the body
they were handed at birth.
You know,
you were,
you're born,
the details of your body,
of your limitations,
physical and mental limitations
are currently set
by stray cosmic rays
that,
that hit the cells
of embryos,
you know,
going back
however many,
however many eons ago
and,
and people,
I think people
of the future
are going to be aghast
at this,
at this notion
that we just had to,
we just had to live that way
and there was no,
no whole,
you know,
no,
no,
no opportunity
for,
for improvement.
We just had to,
you know,
deal,
deal with the consequences
of these,
of these stochastic processes
that don't really care
about our,
our goals
or our capabilities
or our values
or any of that.
So,
so the final thing
I want to show you
in the last couple of minutes
is,
is this.
If you look at this little,
this little creature,
so now let's go even beyond.
So I've shown you
how to communicate
with the intelligence
of the body
for repair,
then the idea
that you can use that
to make radical changes
in the structure,
you can make other kinds of,
you know,
different,
different kinds of embodiments
and now I want to go,
go even further than that
and really talk about
the plasticity
and the capabilities
of the material of life.
What else can it really do?
So if you look at something
like this,
this looks like
some kind of
primitive creature
I got off the bottom
of a pond somewhere.
It actually,
it turns out
if you were to sequence
the genome,
it's 100% homo sapiens.
We call these anthrobots.
These are made of
adult human cells.
So human patients
donate tracheal epithelial cells
and we have a way
of enabling them
to self-assemble.
We really don't do much.
The cells do all the hard work.
They self-assemble
into this little motile creature.
This creature has
four different behaviors
that it switches between
so you can build
a little ethogram
of its behaviors.
If you look at
the gene expression here,
this volcano plot,
they express
about 9,000 genes
differently than
the cells in the body
that they come from.
In other words,
about half the genome
is drastically remodeled.
But we haven't touched the DNA.
We haven't done anything
to the genome.
We haven't added
any weird nanomaterials.
There are no
synthetic biology circuits.
These are completely
wild-type cells.
And yet,
they're capable of having
a very different embodiment.
This looks nothing like
any stage of human development.
And they pick and choose
what genes out of the genome
they're going to express.
They have some wacky capabilities.
Like,
if you plate a bunch
of human neurons here,
these anthrobots will come
and they'll sit down
in this superbot cluster
and they start repairing
the gap.
So they'll sit there
and they'll knit
the neurons together
across this wound.
Now,
who would have thought,
who knew that the cells
in your airway
are capable of becoming
a self-multile little creature
that, by the way,
likes to heal neural wounds?
Yeah,
we would have never known that.
So the biomedical aspect,
so there's two aspects
of note here.
The biomedical aspect
is that someday
you will have biobots
made of your own cells
that can be injected
into your body
to make repairs.
You don't need immune therapy
because they're your own cells.
They won't be rejected.
And can we learn
to program these things
to enhance their healing abilities
so that they can have
all kinds of useful activities
in the body?
But the other thing
is the plasticity,
the incredible plasticity
of life.
There's never been
any anthrobots.
There's never been
any evolutionary selection
to be a good anthrobot.
You know,
where does this come from?
We can talk about that too.
But what that means,
that incredible plasticity
means that almost any level
in biology can be augmented
or manipulated by engineering.
And so when we talk
about ethics,
a lot of people like to
sort of compare,
you know,
well, I'm a real human
and then there are these machines
and we're very different.
Well, the problem
you're all going to be facing
in your lifetime,
no doubt about it,
is not what to do
with language models
sitting inside a server somewhere.
It's this.
This guy has had
various modifications
and there are a lot of people
who are going to be interested
in figuring out
is this a quote-unquote
real human?
Is it, you know,
what are we going to do?
Is it 51% implants
and now you're not a real human?
What is going to happen
to beings that are extended,
rationally extended
and modified in other ways?
And that opens up
numerous questions
and really, I think,
is going to be very difficult
and lead to a lot of moral lapses
if we insist on binary categories
where, you know,
using old school methods,
we're going to try to figure out
if this is a human or a machine.
I'm going to skip a couple things here
because we're running out of time.
Just to end on this,
this is not about biology at all,
I don't think.
We have started looking
at extremely minimal systems.
If any of you take programming,
you will no doubt
have heard of sorting algorithms,
things like bubble sort and so on.
All computer science students study them.
They are very short,
simple, deterministic algorithms.
And what we found
is that even those things,
when you look at them the right way,
are doing things other,
in addition to what is actually
in the algorithm.
In other words,
the algorithm makes them sort numbers
and they do
and they sort the numbers,
but also they do other stuff.
They have these other side quests
is the best way I can describe it
that are nowhere in the algorithm.
And so they have a simple version
of what we have.
In other words,
you have to obey physics,
but within the context of that,
in your life,
you do all kinds of things
that are not actually prescribed
by the physics at all.
And it doesn't take life
and it doesn't take complexity
and it doesn't take a brain
to be able to do that.
I think it's baked in
all the way down.
And that means
that all of natural life
is a tiny little speck
in this enormous space
of possible bodies and minds.
You know,
pretty much any combination
of evolved material,
engineered material,
software,
and something
I haven't had a chance
to talk about,
but basically patterns
that are not
in the physical world at all
is some kind of being
with some kind
of embodied intelligence
that we are going
to have to learn to live with.
And part of the ethics
of the future
is developing
a kind of synthbiosis,
a synthetic,
a mutually beneficial interaction
with beings
that are not like us at all.
So I'm just going to thank
the postdocs
and the students
who did some of the work
that I showed you today.
And again,
some disclosures.
There's three companies
that have spun out
of all this stuff
and our funders
and most of all,
the systems
that we learn from.
They do all the heavy lifting.
So I will stop here.
I'll thank you
and take questions.
