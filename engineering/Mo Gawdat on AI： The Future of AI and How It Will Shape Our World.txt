It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Thank you very much.
Sunshine she's here
Hello, hello. Hello, frogs.
Yeah.
I am a frog too.
I have been for quite a bit of time.
I think recently I started to try to jump out of the water.
At least to tell you that the water is boiling.
Because like that boring proverb we've always heard,
the idea that the frog, when you put it in cold water
and heat the water slowly,
the frog doesn't notice.
And then eventually the frog gets boiled alive.
I have to admit,
this hit me really, really strongly by 2020.
When you look back from 2020,
you realize there were so many signs
that we were going to get a very big pandemic
that is going to affect us.
If you look back at history in 1920,
it was around the same time.
And, you know, we've had swine flu and bird flu
and all of the other things, SARS and so on before that.
And yet somehow no one said,
hey, by the way,
should we be cautious about a possible pandemic?
And then when COVID started,
you know, first patient, nobody's paying attention.
20 patients, nobody cares.
100 patients, 1,000 patients.
It was really when we started to get to a million
that suddenly everyone was like,
the water's boiling.
We're all going to die.
Interesting.
You seem to,
I don't blame anyone for this.
I've recently been putting a lot of attention
in understanding the economic
and geopolitical situation of the world.
And until I started to,
I thought it was chill.
It was okay.
Nothing was...
And then you start to put your head into it.
I think what happens is,
for each and every one of us,
we have limited capacity as humans.
Like, we can focus on 10 topics, right?
15.
And if AI is not one of them,
it doesn't really exist to us.
Okay?
Now, I'm here to tell you,
this is it.
The world as you know it is over.
Completely done.
Okay?
It's not about to be over.
It's over.
Right?
And so,
I'd openly say,
you probably have a year.
Not to live.
You're going to live more than a year, I hope.
But, you know,
you probably have a year to react.
Okay?
And don't blame me.
Because, honestly,
I'm never coming back to speak to you.
Next year,
you're probably going to invite my avatar.
Right?
And I promise you,
that's the truth.
Before I came here yesterday,
just for the fun of it,
I asked Gemini and ChatGPT,
I said,
give me a 35-minute speech on AI
and read me minutes 2 to 4.
Yeah, it did sound a bit like a politician,
but it made a speech.
Right?
And it's quite interesting how we ignore that,
because with something like ChatGPT 4.0,
which came out this week,
it not only prepared the speech,
but it now can also laugh with me
and sing with me
and, you know,
tell me things.
It sounds very Californian to me,
but anyway,
you know,
I've lived with Californians long enough
to put up with it.
Right?
But it is real.
It is real.
And if you haven't used it,
where have you been in the water?
Right?
Now, if we were to understand,
I'm going to try to speak for 30 minutes
and then allow us maybe 15 minutes of a chat
so that we can, you know,
come around this as a community.
What I'll try to do is first help you understand
where we're coming from.
Because if you understand the trajectory
of what's been happening,
how quickly that thing is launching,
you can imagine how it's going to look like next year.
Right?
So where we came from,
I'm a very serious geek.
I started coding at age eight,
which feels like a zillion years ago.
And when I coded,
believe it or not,
age eight,
first time I coded,
I was using basic,
which is,
as the name implies,
a very basic language.
And I wanted to create an AI.
That was my dream.
Right?
Every one of us geeks,
we just wanted to create an AI.
It was everyone's dream.
We never managed to,
but we did something that appeared intelligent.
So, you know,
let me start by defining what is AI.
Every piece of code I've ever written
before the year 2000
was a piece of code
where I solved the problem first
with my intelligence
and then told the computer how to solve it.
Right?
So it's almost like
if I call one of you
and give you a puzzle
and then tell you this piece
you put in the top left corner
and then that piece under it
and that piece under it
and then turn this one and so on.
You can finish the puzzle
and if someone doesn't hear me
giving you the instructions,
they would think you're very smart,
but you're not.
Right?
By the turn of the century,
this ended.
Right?
So the idea of us telling computers what to do,
by the way,
they did it very quickly,
very accurately at a massive scale
and so they appeared smart.
Okay?
But it was me who solved the problem.
It was my intelligence multiplied.
Right?
By the turn of the century,
we discovered something called deep learning
and deep learning was truly teaching computers
the way I taught my children
how to be intelligent.
The way I taught my children
how to be intelligent
was to give them little puzzle pieces
when they were young,
you know,
those cylinders
and a board with different holes in it
and no one ever told their children,
no, no, hold on, my son,
take the cylinder,
turn it upside down,
look at the cross section,
it will look like a circle,
compare it to those holes,
it will match the one that is a circle,
put it there.
Nobody ever tells their children that.
What we do is we give them a cylinder
and a board
and they keep trying,
trying, trying, trying, trying,
until one time it goes through
and then suddenly,
boom, light bulb
and they learn something.
Right?
That's exactly what we did with computers
with deep learning.
By the way,
we started to be able to do deep learning
because by the year 2020,
sorry, by the year 2000,
the internet was big enough
for us to have those number of trials
for the computers to learn on their own.
Now, please understand,
when we did that,
I think my favorite example of that
was the year 2009.
We did it earlier,
but at the time I was at Google
and we published a paper
called the Cat Paper.
And the Cat Paper was,
basically,
we asked the computers to watch YouTube
and tell us what they find.
We had a lot of capacity,
compute capacity,
so they would take YouTube videos,
cut them into 10 frames per second
and compare the patterns on the 10 frames,
basically trying.
And then one of them said,
I found something,
we had to write a bit of code
to find out what it found,
and it had found a cat.
Of course, it's YouTube.
Right?
And it didn't only find one cat,
it found what makes something a cat.
It could literally find every cat on YouTube.
We never taught it how,
we never understood how it did it.
Understand that.
Right?
And the code that was written
for a computer to find every cat on YouTube,
if I had written it the traditional way,
would have been probably 200 million lines of code.
because I would have to find every possible interpretation
of how a cat looks on YouTube
and get the computer to see that.
Right?
That code was this big.
Right?
But there was a lot of numbers and mathematics
that we don't understand.
Just like I can ask you a question
and you'd give me a very intelligent answer,
and I have no clue what happened inside your brain
to get to that answer.
This is where we are.
Computers find their own intelligence.
We don't teach them how.
We just give them the data to learn.
And they learn like humans.
And every task we've ever given them since,
they've become better than humans at.
Right?
So they are the world champion in chess.
They are the world champion in go.
They are the world champion in everything we've given them.
They are the best manipulator of humanity on the planet
in terms of social media engines.
They are the best writers, the best artists,
the best musicians, the best anything we've ever given them.
Right?
And between the turn of the century
and the time when we recognize that,
which is what I normally refer to as the Netscape moment.
Right?
So 2023, every one of you started to hear about AI.
That's not because AI started in 2023.
Right?
AI started in 2000.
And by 2016, all of us in the lab, we knew we got it.
Right?
By 2016, we had created code that would blow you away.
Right?
We started to fold proteins.
If you understand, protein folding is one of the most complex problems
ever faced by biologists in history.
You know, it would take a group of PhD students
around eight months to fold one protein.
We created AlphaFold in 2016, 2017,
and it folded 200 million proteins.
Okay?
In a day.
Hmm?
Now, when ChatGPT came out in 2023,
people said,
oh, there's something called AI.
It's not because AI started.
It's because we had a browser.
Just like Netscape,
when, you know, the internet came out in 1995.
The internet had existed for almost 15 years before.
It's just that for the first time we had a browser,
we could see it.
Now, since 2023,
until today,
it's been mind-blowing.
Okay?
Just to give you a few statistical pointers to understand.
First of all,
intelligence is a lot deeper than ChatGPT.
Let's be very clear.
Okay?
The task given to ChatGPT and Gemini and others
is linguistic intelligence.
It's the ability to understand knowledge and communicate
and so on and so forth.
Okay?
Of course, there are other forms of intelligence,
emotional intelligence, for example.
They haven't learned yet.
Right?
Intuition.
You know, complex mathematics.
Deep reasoning.
All of those forms of intelligence.
We haven't seen AI perform that way yet,
but we will very soon.
And I'll tell you why.
But what we did is,
as we gave them that task,
we have a machine called ChatGPT
that is estimated in certain tasks
to perform at 110 IQ
and in other tasks at 155 IQ.
Just so that you know,
Elon Musk is 155.
Einstein, which was never really measured,
is estimated to be 162.
So we have machines today
that are as intelligent as Einstein.
And we as humans,
sitting in the cold water,
the gradually heating water,
are chilling and, you know,
discussing and saying,
oh, no,
but we will always be humans.
We will always be in the lead.
They will always need us.
Okay?
And I used to go mad in 2016
when people would tell me,
oh, but, hold on.
You know, AI, no.
You know, humans were capable of creativity.
We're capable of, you know,
poetry and music.
And these are things that AI would never do.
What?
What do you mean?
Basically, they're doing every one of them
better than us.
Right?
Why?
Because if you take the most complex of them
innovation, for example,
in my very geeky mind,
innovation can be turned into
a mathematical equation.
It's basically an instruction to a machine
that says,
find every possible solution to a problem,
discard the ones that were proposed before,
give me the ones that have never been proposed before.
Before, and that is innovation.
This is it.
Right?
It's solutions to a problem
that have not been seen before.
Now, what does that mean?
We're all going to die.
No, we're not.
Okay?
What it means is that the world has changed.
Okay?
And the key word to artificial intelligence
is singularity.
It's that we don't actually know
how the world will change.
Right?
A singularity is an event horizon
where the rules of the game change so much
that you're no longer able to understand
how the game will be played.
Okay?
When the rules of the game become
that the smartest person you can ever hire
in your company is no longer a human,
okay,
everything you know about the rules of HR change.
Okay?
When the rules of the game change
to the point where your customer
is not necessarily making their choices themselves anymore,
but that the machine will recommend to them
the rules of the game change.
When, you know,
I've seen beautiful marketing advertising campaigns here,
when there will be a moment in the near future
when machines will be marketing to machines
and we will be out of the picture altogether,
the rules of the game change.
Right?
And I want to say that
as the rules of the game change,
we can end up in a magnificent utopia of abundance.
Right?
And we can also end up in a dystopia
of a very difficult time.
Let me talk about the utopia of abundance first
so that you understand
I'm not here to scare you.
I'm here to tell you that the water is boiling.
Right?
My objective is for you to jump out of the pan.
Right?
But to do that,
I have to tell you it's boiling and that hurts.
Right?
Let's talk about the abundance first.
The abundance is this.
You may not feel it anymore,
but the reason we have all of this technology
is because there is a plug in the wall
that is providing a very valuable resource
called electricity.
Electricity has become a utility.
It's in the back of our minds.
We don't even think about it anymore.
Right?
There will be another plug in the wall,
probably in your pocket, in your phone,
that is called intelligence.
It's a utility.
Okay?
And today, just last night,
okay, I plugged into that intelligence
and I got myself what I would probably estimate
to be an extra 25 IQ points.
I became 25 IQ points more intelligent yesterday
as I was analyzing a complex problem using AI.
Right?
There will be a moment in the future
where I will plug in and get another 100 IQ points.
There will be a moment in the future
where I will plug in and get 400 IQ points more.
Right?
Now, I can promise you this.
If you give me or any of my peers
that I worked with at Google X
400 IQ points more,
I will solve every problem on planet Earth.
Every single one of them.
Climate change,
you know,
wars,
wealth,
whatever.
Okay?
As a matter of fact,
I keep telling people openly
that
with 400 IQ points more,
I can plant a garden outside
where you can walk to one tree
and pick an apple
and walk to another tree
and pick an iPhone.
Okay?
From a nanophysics point of view,
it's the exact same cost.
Right?
And we are on the verge.
If you understand where we are
on nanophysics
and nanomanufacturing in general,
we are on the verge
of being able to do that.
We just need to be
slightly more intelligent.
Okay?
Now, that is a world of abundance
where everything changes.
Imagine if we can solve
the energy problem
to the point where energy becomes
zero cost.
Because energy is so abundant around us.
Okay?
What would that do
to the geopolitics?
Would we fight over energy anymore?
Would we, you know,
how would the cost of products
become if energy was free?
Think about all of that.
Okay?
That's a utopia
that is almost impossible
to imagine,
that completely changes
everything we've ever learned,
definitely changes retail.
Okay?
And it is literally
a few years away.
Right?
There are, however,
on the path to get there,
quite a few challenges.
And actually,
when we get there as well,
there are quite a few challenges.
And those challenges,
let me be very, very clear,
are not a problem with AI.
Okay?
Let me be very, very clear.
There is absolutely nothing wrong
with artificial intelligence.
There is absolutely no threat
to be found
in artificial intelligence.
There is a lot wrong
with the value system
of humanity
in the age of the rise
of artificial intelligence.
Right?
There is a lot wrong
with the way humans
will use this superpower.
Okay?
So the way I look at it
is I say it's like
raising Superman.
Right?
You adopt this infant
who has superpowers.
And if you teach the infant
to protect and serve,
it becomes Superman.
If you teach it
to go and rob a bank
and kill your enemy,
it becomes supervillain.
The superpower is irrelevant.
Okay?
It's the value set
that you create
around raising that infant
that will create
the future of humanity.
Now, there are five areas
that I need to highlight
as areas where you have
to understand the change.
Okay?
One of them,
very important,
is the area of power
and wealth.
Okay?
We humans have lived
in a world of scarcity
since we have started.
A world of scarcity
that basically says
for me to grow,
my competitor has to shrink.
Okay?
A world of scarcity
that basically means
I have to be
the military superpower
in the world,
otherwise everyone
will kill me.
Right?
That world of scarcity
is no longer going
to be the truth.
But going to get there,
I think what's going
to end up happening
is we're going
to apply the same mentality
of collecting
as much power
and wealth as we can.
Now, let me help
you understand this.
If you look back
at human history,
there was a time
when we were hunter-gatherers.
So basically,
the best hunter
in the tribe
would be able
to maybe feed the tribe
for a day more,
two days more.
Right?
Why?
Because that hunter
had himself to hunt
and the maximum automation
he had was a spear.
Right?
When we became farmers,
the best farmer
could feed the tribe
a month more.
Why?
Because that best farmer
knew how to use
a form of automation
called soil.
Right?
So while the farmer
put the seed
and used his own
human resources
to manage that seed,
the soil did
most of the work.
Right?
When the Industrial Revolution
started,
factories,
with one person
handling the operation,
would multiply
the production.
When information
revolution happened,
we now don't even
have to go to work.
We can work from home
and make a difference.
Right?
And as you can see,
every time
the form of automation
became more powerful,
the more we multiplied
our productivity
and the more
we multiplied abundance.
But at the same time,
the more we multiplied
the power of those
who owned the automation.
Right?
So the best hunter
in the tribe
may have been preferred
by the leader
or fancied
by the women
of the tribe.
That's the maximum
you could get.
The best farmers
didn't make the money.
The landlord
made the money.
Why?
Because the landlord
owned the automation.
The best industrialists,
the best engineer
in the Porsche factory
is not the one
that makes most of the money.
It's the company
that makes the money.
And so on.
Right?
And so you will see
that very soon
we will have trillionaires,
not billionaires,
because some people
will acquire
massive power and wealth.
Okay?
Because the automation
using AI
is basically
multiple times
the automation
that was using
the internet.
Right?
At the same time,
you'll see that
with nations.
So a nation
that gets a significant
AI advantage
in cyber security
or in, you know,
robotic warfare
would have
a very significant advantage
and all of the other nations
would have to submit.
So there is a massive
concentration of power
that is also combined
with what I know,
by the way,
in business as well,
huh?
Between you guys,
if some of you
are competing
in the same country
or the same city,
the one that manages
to harness intelligence
more than the others
will get a massive advantage.
At the same time,
there is a prolification
of power.
A prolification of power
meaning
I could probably
leaving this room
on my phone
order a printer
for $22,000
and by the time
I get home
I can print COVID.
Synthetic biology
now allows me
to print living DNA.
Okay?
And that's available
open source
for everyone
for around $22,000.
Right?
That prolification
of power
mixed with
concentration of power
will lead
to an environment
of a lot of regulation
and surveillance
and control.
This is the very first thing
you have to understand.
Right?
Concentration,
surveillance,
and control
means that your consumer
is not as free
as your consumer
used to be.
Okay?
Another thing
that will actually happen
very quickly
is that a lot
of your consumers
will run out of business.
They'll basically
become out of a job.
Why?
Because jobs
will go
to the automation platform.
Right?
Your jobs
will not go
to the automation platform.
They will go
to someone
who knows
how to use
the automation platform.
I know I sound
very grim.
I apologize.
I'm just telling you
what is about to happen.
Okay?
What will happen
in the next
five to ten years
is that
a retailer
who knows
how to use AI
really, really well
will take the place
of a retailer
that doesn't.
Okay?
And so you might
as well be
that retailer.
The idea of us
think about it
this way.
There is
around 70%
of the code
written last year
was written
by a machine.
So I'm talking
about my own
geeky life.
Okay?
And I'm a very
serious geek
but I'm old.
Right?
So I cannot
write code
that competes
with the machines
anymore.
The machines
will write better
code than I am.
There are still
30% younger
developers
that are so
good at what
they do
that they still
write code
better than
the machines
for now.
But remember
over time
the machines
will learn
that code
and learn
how to write
it as well.
That's number
two.
Number three
which I think
is really
incredibly important
in retail
is the nature
of human
connection
will change
massively.
Okay?
The nature
of human
connection
if you actually
please do
search for
chat GPT
4.0
videos
when we're done
with today
and look
at how
have you ever
seen the movie
Her?
If you have
you know
it's an AI
that pretends
to be human.
Yeah
chat GPT
I actually think
that the voice
that they used
in the video
sounds like
Scarlett Johansson.
Right?
It is so
it laughs
with you
it reads
your handwriting
it sees
the environment
you're sitting
in
it you know
it is singing
with you
and it's
becoming
so difficult
to identify
what is real
and what is not
which will
have a massive
impact on human
connection
both ways
by the way.
Okay?
One way
is that
a lot of people
will
especially
with the
pandemic
of loneliness
that we have
in the world
today
will find
an AI friend
or an AI
girlfriend.
Right?
You know
there are more
than 50,000
AI influencers
on Instagram
today
that people
follow and listen
to that are
not even human
they're just
generated by a machine.
Okay?
And it's becoming
really
from one side
becoming a replacement
for human connection
but from the other side
it makes us crave
genuine human connection
even more.
Okay?
So this
by the way
if I send the avatar
next year
it's not going to feel
the same.
Right?
When we're done
with this
I'll be around
for your coffee break
and we can shake hands
and it's going to feel
very different
than it is
with a machine
and I think
this in my view
is one of the biggest
differentiators
unlike what most people
will tell you
about what you can do
and I'll come back
to what you can do
in a minute
what you can do
in the age
of artificial intelligence
of course
you have to learn
the tools
but believe me
in the next
5 to 10 years
those who will
capitalize on
human connection
will actually
outperform
those who don't.
So those who
replace everything
with a machine
are going to
to become
more efficient
but those who
will capitalize
on human connection
will become
more loved.
The other
and maybe
the last trend
I want to talk about
is the trend
of the absence
of the truth
or the end
of the truth.
So there is
a lot happening
today
in the geopolitics
politics and economics
of the world
and even in AI
and climate change
and so on
where you no longer
know if it's true
or not
because the
mainstream media
and social media
is covering it
in a way
that makes you
no longer
understand
what is true
and what is not.
And I think
the reality
is one of the
biggest skills
is those
with authenticity
and genuine
honesty
as humans
or as businesses
will very quickly
get again
the favor
of people
around them
of their clients
and their partners
and so on.
Right.
I'm going to quickly
talk about
what we need
to do
in this environment.
I really apologize
for concerning you.
Everything that I spoke
to you about
by the way
in terms of the changes
that are about to come
are not changes
because of the machines.
Did you notice that?
These are changes
because of the way
the humans
will use the machines.
Equally by the way
humans could use
those machines
to say
let's completely
ignore power.
Every one of us
can live like an emperor.
It's fine.
Okay.
We don't need to compete
but that's not
the human tendency.
The human tendency
which I believe
will eventually change
is that
we want to aggregate more.
We want to win.
Right.
That's the capitalist mindset
that America has built
you know
since World War II.
Prior
but really
propagated very strongly.
Okay.
There will be a time
in my view
where we will all go back
and say
why are we competing
for this?
Right.
The difference
between
the worst car
in the world
and the best car
in the world
is zero.
Everything is so perfect.
Right.
The difference
between the abundance
that every one of us
can have today
and you know
the life
that the Roman emperors
had
is infinite.
Right.
So why are we competing
for more?
So I call that normally
in my book
Scary Smart
I call it
the fourth inevitable
that eventually
humanity will come
to a point
where the extra fight
is not worth the effort
because everyone
is getting such
an incredibly
affordable
amazing access
to technology
and life.
Right.
So what do we need to do?
I'll say that
in a couple of minutes
and then we open
for questions.
There are three skills
that every organization
and every human
and by the way
your kids as well
need to learn.
One is
learn the tools.
Learn AI.
Don't live
in the fax machine
era anymore.
When you leave today
go to one of the
top tools
Gemini
or
ChatGPT
and basically ask
and say
I'm in retail
I live in this country
I'm very interested
in food and beverage
retail
or whatever
I don't know
something.
What tools
should I be aware of?
What tools
what AI tools
should I be aware of
if I want to
find
create videos
or create
marketing material
or whatever
and it will tell you
and then you can
follow from there.
By the way
remember
nobody taught you
PowerPoint.
You didn't need
a tutor to tell you that.
So nobody will
teach you AI.
There will not be
a course.
You just
hold the tool
and start chatting
to it.
That's skill number one.
Skill number two
is I urge you
I urge you
I urge you
to find the truth.
Find the truth.
the sign of this era
is for you
to not be
did you see the movie
Idiocracy?
That's a cult classic.
You have to see that.
You really have to
find a way
to tell yourself
not everything
I'm being told
is true
I need to find out
for myself
what the truth is.
So the biggest difference
between ChatGPT
and Google Search
when I worked at Google
is that
when you searched Google
it gave you
a million sites
and told you
find your own truth.
When you search
ChatGPT
it tells you
with confidence
the answer is
boom
a highly influenced
Californian answer
and view of the world.
I went and asked
ChatGPT
what is Mo Gaudet's
wife name
for four times
in a row
it told me
the wrong name
with total confidence.
And every time
I corrected it
it said
oh I'm sorry
yeah maybe you're right
and then on the fifth time
I said
what is Mo Gaudet's
wife's name
it gave me
the right answer
which is
I don't know.
AI is not capable
of doing that.
So that's the second
top skill.
The third skill
is human connection.
Believe it or not
I'm going the exact
opposite way.
So I know the tools
I spend three hours a day
to keep up
believe it or not.
I'm very very careful
about understanding
the truth.
That's the reason
why I spend so much time
in deep analysis
of geopolitical
and economic issues.
But the third one
is human connection.
So I'm no longer
writing books.
I just had my
fourth bestseller
last week
and that's it.
I'm not actually
going to write books again
because books
are not human.
I'm going to go
more and more
and more in this.
So my next topic
to champion
I will actually
prepare speeches
about it.
I will go and speak
about it on podcasts.
I may even prepare
a webinar about it
or whatever
and then I will ask
an AI to write
the book.
Okay?
I no longer
need to do the tasks
that they can do
better than me.
But the task
I can do better
than them
is this.
Is to be able
to see you
and hug you
and say hi
and so on
and so forth.
I'll stop now.
I think that gives
us around 13-14
minutes for Q&A
and I think
it would be better
to focus on
what you want
to think about.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Yeah, so Mo and I
have a chat
digging some of those
topics a bit deeper
for 10 minutes
but importantly
we've got this time.
If you would like
to ask Mo a question
please do.
It's an opportunity.
It's not a threat.
I think
I can't believe
that no one's got
anything they'd like
to dig into.
There you go.
I don't even have
to ask the first question.
Hang on one sec.
We've got a microphone
coming.
Thanks.
Hi Mo.
You described yourself
as a geek
and you are
a master of code.
So is it possible
to digitalize
fear or anger?
Oh yeah.
100%.
So that's a question
I get quite a lot.
again from
the typical way
of people saying
AI will never be creative,
will never make music
and so on.
So most emotions
I would probably now
almost say all emotions.
I'll tell you why
I moved my mind on that.
Most emotions
are very algorithmic.
We don't see them
that way
because they seem irrational.
But fear
is a moment
in the future
is perceived
to be less safe
than now.
when you logically
perceive that
you feel fear.
In our biological machine
our biological machine
is wired to
sense that
before your logical
brain engages.
As a matter of fact
your amygdala
will perceive a fear
90 seconds
before your
prefrontal cortex
perceives it.
That's why
if something shows up
behind you
you jump
without thinking.
But the same algorithm
is true.
A moment in the future
is less safe
than now.
A machine can
definitely perceive that.
I can easily
program that
in the machine
and if you give
the machine a task
to for example
merchandise your store
it will absolutely
as it becomes
more intelligent
it will look for
possible threats
in the future
that might prevent it
from merchandising
the store.
That will be
analogous to fear.
And all of the
other emotions.
Anger.
Anger is
a difference
in value set.
It's a form of fear
but instead of
fight or flight response
there is a hiss response.
Let me
scream
so that you run away.
Instead of me running
flight or flight
I want you to run.
That's anger.
And yeah
once again
it is a sense
of difference
in value set
combined with
a sense of
feeling unsafe
around someone
or something
or some situation
leads to anger.
And you can take
all of them
you can take
all of them
all emotions
perhaps other than love
can actually follow
an algorithmic
path.
Now
remember
the way
a cat
responds to anger
is different
or fear
is different
than the way
a puffer fish
responds.
It's different
than the way
we respond.
And it's also
going to be different
than the way
a machine responds.
right
so you know
fear for a puffer fish
makes it puff
right
for a cat
it hisses
and for a human
we fight or flight
right
for a machine
it might move
its code
to another place
a different reaction
but the logic
of the emotion
is the same.
I even dare say
and I know
it sounds really
shocking
that we
that the machines
will have a wider
range of emotions
than we do.
and the reason
for that logic
is
we have a wider
range of emotion
than a goldfish
because we can
understand concepts
like the future
right
and so we can
ponder emotions
like you know
optimism and pessimism
because we can have
an image of the future
you know
a goldfish doesn't do that
right
and because the
intellectual bandwidth
of the machines
is likely going to be
bigger than ours
they may feel things
that we don't really
understand at all
I think that's about
to happen as well.
Having said that
I should also remind you
that as I said
in the beginning
emotionally intelligence
has not been
the big investment
of the AI community
so far
even though
in my view
the natural evolution
of the intelligence
of the machines
will lead them
there eventually.
Okay
I'll ask a
I'll ask a question
we were joined by
actually no
sorry
we do have
an audience member
I love that you
prefer their
questions to yours
that's very
selfless
they've been listening
to me for a day
and a half already
so sorry for that
yeah
we talked last
today a lot
about measurement
so maybe
to ask a question
after the emotions
like
is there any
good way
you know
how to measure
the emotions
oh
I do not know
the answer
to that
I don't know
the answer
to that
I have
my last book
is about stress
and we talk
very clearly
we have
a chapter
called
emotional stress
right
and the idea
is that
we in
the modern world
sadly
have been trained
to think
when we go
to school
we haven't been
trained to feel
okay
we have
been trained
to
unfortunately
suppress our
emotions
you know
somehow
because in the
workplace
and in school
emotions can lead
to a lot of
unpredictability
right
we started
to tell our
kids at very
young age
sit down
don't cry
just be
what we tell
you to be
and for a lot
of us
we somehow
are not able
to even sense
our own
emotions
I found
that
for me
specifically
which lived
you know
30 years
of being
a very highly
efficient
effective
you know
corporate
professional
I found
that I can
feel
but I wasn't
allowed
to express
my emotions
in the
workplace
and as
my
connection
to my
body
and my
feminine
side
and my
emotional
side
continued
to grow
I think
that my
very first
measure
was my
emotional
body
connection
so you know
many books
on the topic
the body
keeps the
score
is a great
one
the idea
that when
you trap
an emotion
it basically
grows
and then
eventually
it manifests
in the form
of a
feeling
a sensation
right
you can
easily see
it
you know
anxiety
is you know
felt
somewhere
in your
core
anger
is in
all over
your body
with energy
you know
fear
makes you
want to
coil
and so
you can't
really measure
it but you
can sort
of refer
to it
my co-author
in
unstressable
basically uses
a technique
that she
calls
the
which
where
why
and what
which
where
why
and what
which
is
sort of
a form
of a
meditation
that she
recommends
you do
every evening
before you
go to bed
where you
can sit
with yourself
and say
how
you know
which emotion
am I feeling
is this jealousy
or anger
is this fear
or anxiety
and so on
where in my body
do I feel it
why do I feel it
what's the logic
that's triggering it
and what is it
trying to tell me
okay
not what do I do
about it
by the way
most emotions
just want to be heard
and acknowledged
what do I do
about it
having said that
can we fear
can we measure
that in AI
I don't think
anyone's working
on this at all
and I think
this is a question
that I have never
given any thought
to before
so well done
yeah
thank you
can we get
more of those
questions
that's actually
yeah
that's such
an interesting
question
yeah
Claudia
down the front
here
we heard yesterday
about how
irrational we are
as humans
yes
and in our business
we're always trying
to use research
or any other
methodology
to try to predict
consumer behavior
do you think AI
can help us do that
100%
first of all
I don't think
we're irrational
at all
I think
we're predictably
irrational
right
so because
we are a very
complex machine
that takes
a lot of
input and
parameters
and because
our situation
is always
in flux
our behavior
seems to be
irrational
right
fear seems
to be a very
irrational
response to
things
but you know
when you know
the logic behind
it and if you're
aware to
capture what
triggered it
it's not
irrational
it's the most
rational thing
to do
right
the thing
about AI
is that the way
we teach AI
believe it or
not
is to actually
observe patterns
without judgment
which is such
an interesting
thing that humans
are not capable
of doing
right
so the idea
is an AI
would be able
to say
it wouldn't be
able to explain
why but it
would easily
be able to say
16,000 iPhone
holders walked
by your store
and stopped
for a minute
and then
didn't walk
in
it can
do that
it has
all of that
information
right
and basically
it can also
tell you
and by the way
when you had
green in your
window
6% of them
walked in
and so much
of what is
available out
there
beats the
human capability
to comprehend
right
so as intelligent
as one can
be
how much
data exactly
can you
cram into
this little
one machine
and how quickly
can you transfer
that data
to this machine
is truly
where the
advantage of
AI is
the advantage
is
their memory
structure
is the entire
history of humanity
everything that's
ever been written
everything that's
ever happened
can be comprehended
by one data set
right
and they
communicate
that data set
between them
in a matter
of a microsecond
when it would
take me
half an hour
presentation
to communicate
it to you
right
and perhaps
a day
to prepare
the presentation
right
and at the same
time
which is the
most interesting
side of AI
is that
if you have
you know
a situation
when you're
driving today
and you have
to break
and you learn
something from it
I don't learn
okay
if a self-driving
car goes
through that
situation
every self-driving
car on the
planet learns
right
and so
with those
enormous
shrinkages
in
connection
time
in
you know
enormous
growth in
bandwidth
in memory
size
we will
start to
observe
structures
and data
patterns
that humans
cannot observe
and they'll
give us that
with zero
judgment
okay
more interestingly
sadly
and I say
that with
a broken
heart really
is that
believe it or
not
the top
commercial
application
of AI
in the last
10 years
has been
manipulating
humans
so everything
that you see
on social media
is a machine
that has
learned
so well
which video
I will
click
on next
right
and so
accordingly
it also
can learn
so well
which product
I will buy
at which
price
if it's
presented to
me
with a sticker
of which
color
and I don't
even know
that
and I think
this sadly
is where
the conversation
is going
my biggest
ask
if you would
allow me
to say
is that
while I
urge you
to use
AI
I urge
you to
remember
that the
way you
will use
AI
is the
way
your kids
are going
to be
treated
and you
know
since the
last couple
of years
the geopolitical
the economic
the weather
climate change
and the
technological
advancement
which in my
mind
are creating
a perfect
storm
for the
world
we live
in
the one
song
that keeps
popping up
in my
mind
is a
song
from 20
years ago
or 15
years ago
called
if you
tolerate
this
then your
children
will be
next
okay
and I
think the
reality is
the way
we will
use technology
today
is the way
technology
will be
used on
us
tomorrow
right
and so
I ask
every single
one of
you
to
start
believing
in a
world
of
abundance
right
where
basically
if you
do
things
with
ethics
you can
continue
to
grow
in ways
that are
unheard
of
but
in
the
process
you
would
be
teaching
AI
to
be
superman
not
supervillain
right
and so
don't
abuse
AI
to
take
more
money
from
consumers
use
AI
to
create
a
better
life
for
consumers
right
and if
your
intention
is to
create
better
life
for
consumers
you
still
make
money
and
you
know
when
people
ask
me
about
the
threat
of
AI
and
what
can
we
do
about
it
I
answer
with
one
word
okay
most
of
the
geeks
like
me
will
say
either
solve
the
control
problem
so
write
code
to
make
the
AI
submit
to
us
or
solve
the
safety
problem
which
is
you
know
write
code
so
when
AI
does
something
wrong
we
can
be
safe
right
I
say
it's
an
ethics
problem
it
is
not
about
controlling
AI
or
even
teaching
AI
to
cure
cancer
this
is
using
AI
for
good
it's
about
teaching
AI
not
to
lie
it's
about
teaching
AI
not
to
cheat
it's
about
teaching
AI
not
to
steal
it's
about
teaching
AI
not
to
abuse
humans
right
and
the
only
way
you
can
do
that
is
to
be
a
good
parent
the
only
way
those
machines
can
learn
ethics
is
by
observing
us
humans
using
them
in
an
ethical
way
most
people
will
tell
me
oh
but
so
many
humans
are
unethical
I
don't
believe
that
to
be
true
I
believe
that
most
humans
will
disapprove
of a
school
shooting
most
humans
will
not
approve
of
a
child
being
killed
the
reason
why
so
many
people
are
debating
killing
children
today
is
simply
because
they're
not
informed
approve
of
killing
an
innocent
child
everyone
will
say
no
on
every
side
of
every
conflict
and
I
think
this
is
the
true
test
of
humanity
that
era
that
we're
in
today
and
you
are
responsible
leaders
that
can
actually
implement
that
the
true
test
of
humanity
is
if
I
told
you
we're
going
into
an
age
of
total
abundance
and
all
that
I
ask
you
for
is
use
that
abundance
ethically
would
still
be
more
profitable
but
you're
just
going
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
basically
is
the
way
you
want
your
daughter
to
be
treated
and
I
think
if
we
can
manage
to
get
this
right
we
would
end
up
in
the
utopia
I
described
to
you
if
we
don't
believe
it
or
not
just
so
that
I
don't
leave
you
on
a
fearful
thought
we
will
still
end
up
in
the
utopia
we
will
just
have
to
struggle
along
the
path
until
we're
convinced
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
fight
anymore
wonderful
well
I
think
unfortunately
we're
out
of
time
but
I
think
that's
a
fantastic
and
uplifting
note
to
end
on
so
Mo
Gauder
everybody
