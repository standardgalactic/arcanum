welcome everyone to another voices with raveki i'm here with somebody who's been here before
and uh we had an amazing conversation this is part of a series of ongoing conversations i'm having
um they often get into dialogos on ifs and related topics around ally work and parts work and
the dialogical nature of the self i've recorded uh one recently with paul vander clay on just this
topic uh it'll come out shortly uh recorded one with mark lewis which will come out um
so i've been dying yeah diving very deeply in all of this um and uh so uh first of all
kazra great to have you back um why don't you just tell us again a little bit about yourself
you know your credentials and um you uh how you're in like how your work and my work are connected
in your mind and things like that very good to have you back it was a great pleasure talking with
you last time thank you john thanks for having me it's uh it's a pleasure to be back and to you know
to talk with you again so yeah i'm castro mirzai you introduced me i'm a clinical researcher i'm a
psychotherapist and i'm i'm also a teacher at a university so i'm doing this kind of you know
three things teaching researching and treating like doing psychotherapy and um basically i have a very
broad spectrum of interests in my work so it's on the one hand it's ifs related i'm by training i'm
a behavioral therapist and i do combine certain things i work especially with adolescents and um
adolescent um residential crisis center where i'm working with heavily impaired adolescents from 14 to
18 that have like you know personality disorders severely traumatized and at the same time also doing
research on affect dynamics it's called and it's basically it's it's the psychological research of
self-organized criticality i would say oh wow yeah yeah so what i'm what i'm looking at is um how how
emotions and affect how they fluctuate and how uh you know the tipping point comes probably during therapy
it can be doing therapy where things shift where phase transitions um takes place and i'm looking at this
from you know a more technical perspective from a dynamical systems theoretical perspective so that's
the technical part of my work and yeah besides that i'm deeply deeply interested in the question of
meaning basically and um yeah this has drawn me to your work john i've been an avid follower of your
work for many years now and yeah it's a pleasure to talk to you so yeah i'm again i'm this this topics of
meaning and spirituality and how it can be how science and spirituality can become conjoined again
that's deeply deeply relevant to me all right let's talk about this and i'm going to talk to you about
uh self-organizing criticality yeah yeah and i've been doing some recent stuff on that but let's start
with the ifs and there's a couple questions that are come to mind we sort of laughed left off last time
and you brought this up and off camera but the question that i really wrestled with both with
with mark lewis and uh with paul vander clay and um and you know and feel free to sort of you know
fumble your way around because they were too and that's not an insult to them that's not an insult to
them like there was this like like this is a hard question and and i'm gonna well there's two questions
one is the question of self-deception yeah with ifs and the other is the question of self-deception
in is in ifs okay so there's the one is can people use ifs to significantly deceive themselves
bullshit themselves uh there's a new paper out that uh chat gpt4 is basically not lying it's doing
bullshitting where it's making things salient and indifferent to the truth and making us very prone
to that and it's very dangerous already um and so there's that question about uh about self-deception
that way but also can the parts deceive us that's self-deception in ifs can can they deceive us can
they lie to us if they have some intentionality and if they have goals which are sometimes orthogonal or
perhaps even uh opposite of ours could they deceive and lie to us and then that brings up the the
question that is in the in lurking in the background of a lot of religious people's thinking when they
confront ifs which is the possibility of evil um in all of this and then that will i think if we get
into it that in the right way that we can shade into the second topic which is you know ifs and
spirituality and and and things like that but let's start with the first one so what about you know
self-deception with ifs and then we'll move into self-deception in ifs um i if i'm not mistaken it's
it was the even the last question you asked me in the last conversation that we had yeah and um
now i really had time to really good to really sit with the question and i really contemplated on it
and meditated on the question actually more deeply and well first of all thank you for doing that well
thank you for asking because it it really gripped me the question and i think it was interesting
because i was a little bit blindsided by the question and i don't mean this in any kind of you
know reproachful sense or you know but because i had an implicit assumption and i projected like how you
know john bebeke the you know the guy that gives courses and you know dedicated parts of his entire
career to this question is asking me about self-deception so i i i gave an initial answer and i
won't you know state my answer in in a second um but if you allow john i want to first leave out
the ifs bit and address self-deception more broadly and generally and then we can circle back to it if you
yeah yeah that totally fair totally fair that's a socratic move let's step back and make sure we're
clear about our orientation yeah because i also and you know i really took this serious and i and i
really not only thought about it in an intellectual sense i did practices on it on you know how i can
you know answer this how can i address this question how can i get into contact with this question
and it's you're really wetting my appetite you're really wetting my appetite for this well it was an ifs
and let's say jungian informed practice that i did there so yeah so the answer to it is also in the
practice i would say and um yeah as i as i said i was really thinking about it and um so again to
reiterate my initial answer from last time for the audience um part of my answer was that i think we
we we really have to reconnect to our body like deeply inhabit the body again in this meldoponte sense
that you mentioned too and um i also mentioned that we i think that communal feedback is really
necessary like social communal feedback and um i still think it's a good answer but i was i was
dissatisfied with it a little bit because i felt it's incomplete there's something missing
and then it hit me when i you know had my daydreamings and i you know did my practices and all of that
and um so i first of all i think this this communal feedback is also something that ties back to what we
talked about last time about the god skin scaffolding because well ifs is something like an inner ecology
of communal feedback it's like when we take the outer family system or external family system serious
we build a scaffold to internalize this stuff so i i really think that you know external feedback
systems like the community they are important for for correction right to for maybe not self-correction but
correction and um and and and it was interesting because i i think the scaffolding part is important and
something that hit me is just the you know side note john is that um well the scaffold is important
but the goal is this internal internalization because the goal is self-governing you know it's
you know to be self-governed and interestingly enough john i realized recently that that's actually
the if i'm not mistaken i mean you know people can correct me in the comments if they're like
but if i'm not mistaken that's also the root of the word god and farsi in persian it's like
we say hoda and in hoda there is hot which means self and and the term means self-governing so it's
like this auto poetic thing of self-making self-government and this is this is a notion of god that really
that i always found meaningful even as a teenager and even as a kid um so that just as a side note
i i still think this well that's a good one i like this so the the idea that god is sort of
fundamentally like auto poetic in that sense not just self-ruling but self-generative too and
and like i mean i can see what why that would appeal to somebody um uh with you know with with
deep experience and reflection on you know jung and also ifs right because they're well and i can see
that and again neoplatonism and the philosophical yeah right yeah yeah yeah sufi and mystic as well
yeah yeah yeah and and you know um so that was that was one one thing that it came to my mind it's that
it's about this self-government and um so if you'll if you'll allow me that's already that's already
you're doing you know just to put a pin in it for foreshadowing purposes i mean you're already
bringing a spiritual dimension to this because this is a way of like being god-like in this in the
virtuous sense of the word yes being like god participating in god's nature not just representing
and thinking about it but enacting what god is fundamentally in some way is that a fair thing to say
absolutely and i think you you're spot on when you say participate in it because i think there's
this danger of again identifying with god you know self being god but i think it's really a participation
setting up the inner ecology and the right constraints so that this spirit of intelligibility
this this this ultimate can unfold and help us and ultimately that can be also the scaffold too
so that we can self-actualize self-realize so yeah i understand god in that sense at least
from this perspective and okay so that's good excellent that's useful for where we're heading
but let's go back to what you want to say about self-deception so i was sitting in the after our
conversation i was sitting i don't know where i went but i was sitting in the train and i was observing
people and then i thought really thought about this question of self-deception i really left out the ifs
part because i wanted to understand self-deception first the nature of self-deception and if i'm not
mistaken and john you can correct me if i'm wrong but i think fundamentally it's the question about sinning
would you agree on that oh so i think like in the sense of hamatia like you know missing the mark yeah
kind of thing missing mark so i well let me respond because i think this is an important distinction
i think there is self-deception and then i think there is a profound kind of self-deception that begins
to progressively dehumanize us yeah and make us incapable of properly connecting to our humanity
to the our shared humanity and to ultimate reality and then when the self-deception becomes like that
right then i think uh it takes on a kind of existential psychological and ethical and therefore
spiritual profundity and then i would call it sin uh we become incapable in a deep way
of realizing how deeply the self-deception has become i just so i don't want to say things like
you know when i you know i deceive myself about thinking that there's enough food in the fridge
is that a sin yes well yeah yeah yeah it's you know i i've i've made use of the rep the confirmation
bias or something like that it's definitely self-deception but it but it's sin because what you're
doing is this the self-deception is making you miss the mark of connecting to your humanity connecting
to reality that's how i would yes and that that's that's how i was thinking about it not so much from
this moral or ethical perspective like reducing sin to just a misdeed but actually so my my view was that
it's i could be wrong about this but the image that i had in that moment was that it can be on a
continuum from certain biases like cognitive biases that we have to yes yes like really distorted views
that really um fuel misdeeds or you know are the are the vehicle for these kind of things we are
exactly on this we are exactly on the same page about so that to me is important because you know
it's the fundament of my argument or what i was thinking about and and then when i was observing the
people in on the train i realized well it's interesting because if we are all sinners which
we in some in a sense are and me included and those people in the train included how come we can still
relatively live in a peaceful manner i mean obviously right now in parts of the world there are there
isn't so much peace and um but you know you know to be fair it's still you know we can still get along
um and why hasn't all hell broke loose i was thinking and i was wondering if there is any
solution to this problem of self-deception at all because and then then i realized really that it's a
just how you say it it's it's this perennial it's an eternal i would say archetypal struggle that
you really struggle with this and and then i thought well if maybe if if there isn't a solution
maybe there can be a counterbalance like a counter system that can at least balance this out and then
it hit me and i thought what maybe the question could be is is there something more relevant than
self-deception or more pertinent than self-deception okay can i reply to two of those both of those points
so yeah i think the first again i think we're on the same page i think i talked about uh this in
awakening from the meeting crisis yeah uh self when self-deception is like it's that parasitic
processing and especially when it's moving towards sin you need a very comprehensive counteractive
uh like dynamical system that can yeah like counteract right yeah yeah yeah the eightfold path exactly
and and and and and then that idea uh that you just said about um we we get to this state um where
uh you know we're sort of incapable uh of of loving which uh like i think of sin as a failure to love
wisely and so what happens is a lot of our primary abilities get hijacked but we're not completely
bereft of love yeah um and so i mean this is sort of a buddhist christian answer a zen answer and a
zen neoplatonic answer and and and reason is bound up with love so i don't mean it in the modern sense
they're all bound up together right there's a possibility of uh of loving our way into agapically
loving our way into a a a a dharmic dynamical system that can counteract yeah the parasitic processing
and wake us up that was sort of my response to both of the things you said what do you think about
and actually that was my that was this big part of the answer i i arrived at it's like if there is a
panacea then it's love and i would add forgiveness not only in the sense of i forgive you but in this
agapic sense of forgiving so yes that's very much i yeah that struck me like well that could be if
there is a tendency then it's love well obviously we have to differentiate between you know how you love
and i think you know the ability to love wisely is absolutely spot on but but i was thinking like
well people do all we deceive ourselves all the time and we sin all the time right so i was thinking
well what what still helps us to keep the world in balance and it's and it's these and these are
these small acts like well i don't you know don't think about it it doesn't matter it's these small
needs of forgiveness and love that to me balance out this deception that can also you know that too
can you know while i'm saying this i i also again imagined it being on this continuum from bias
cognitive bias to those really big misdeeds that maybe also need forgiveness at times and
yeah i wanna you can respond to me well i was just gonna say and i think i think correspondingly
there's love and forgiveness on a continuum for a moment of somebody steps in front of your way to get
on the bus and you say oh don't worry about it all the way up to um the profound kind of agopic
forgiveness that could end a war yes exactly exactly so that to me was really important to again to ground
me and to now think about the more technical matters but i was thinking of again this you know committing
the act of sin and self-deception and and realizing that it can also be quite traumatic if you do so
if we realize that we haven't properly framed the world correctly the world around us correctly
and also and therefore the space you know of agency and actions and this can often result in remorse and
guilt right so you realize oh you know why did i do this yeah oh i'm really feeling bad about this and
that to me this again necessitates at you know some point if we talk about like real relationships a real
relation also this again this counter counter act of forgiving and loving so yeah yeah i think that's
right i mean uh brandon in his book on hegel talks about a spirit of trust yes and now hegel actually
argues that um we we are we we we are the we that becomes an eye that is part of the we like and
that that and we and and that's absolutely ultimately dependent upon um trust and forgiveness acts of
trust and forgiveness they give us the basic shared normativity so that reason can actually be at work
in the world and if you don't have all of that reason has nothing no purchase on people and it
just degenerates into sort of a a mechanical and maniacal logical machinery or it becomes this weird
twisted cleverness uh exactly and things like that and that's exactly right because i was thinking
about people who are maybe really clever really logical maybe really successful and i was thinking
well i would choose someone with the with his heart in the right place over someone who's really smart
but you know is able to play those games you know anytime any day i would still choose this person
because to me that's like the basis and do you i probably you probably know this this quote by terence
like this i am human and nothing human is alien to me so this to me is really a credo like to really
get to understand the person and and that's you know that's maybe the segue to the to the question of
how ifs also can can respond to it um but before i come to this i i wanted to add to this to my initial
answer i think the missing piece for me was the heart like really what what helps to counteract or you know
transcend self-deception is if if things come from this place from this place from this place of
from the heart and it's having the heart at the right place to me that
well if any practice that engages authentically in this kind of you know let's call it agape in this kind
of you know heart space that practice to me can be deemed virtuous and if ifs does so then ifs too can
help it that's a very good answer so now you may not be implying this so let me ask you a question
is there the possibility of ifs being practiced not from that space and then being a mechanism by which
people engage in very deep or even traumatic kind of self-deception is that a possibility yeah i i
absolutely think so and i would be really skeptical and hesitant about statements that refute that
because i've seen this i've seen people even in ifs engage in this parts language that
that became the root of their self-deception because ultimately it's some form of framing
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and if they then if you don't have a variety of practices
and whatever you want to call maybe beliefs you know believe in a certain practice or whatever
then i think you can it's it's it you can be trapped quicker than you think in it
um so to me i mean i was trained now we can maybe again now we can um focus on ifs a little bit more
um i was trained by um tom holmes who was a professor for clinical psychology i i think
somewhere in michigan i got where i know he lives in kalamazoo and um he he practices i think for like
30 40 years now ifs and he was you know friend close friend he is a close friend of tom holmes but
he kind of has this unique and individual take on ifs where he combines it with spirituality
oh interesting yeah interesting yes and and and i was trained by tom holmes like he's like
so maybe that's why to me they they go hand in hand so much together and he calls it also even a path
of the heart he also has this book john that i can recommend to you it's called i think ifs and
spirituality the path of the heart i have ifs and spirituality path of the heart i will look that
up yeah and thank you and it is his his style is deeply um inspired by his christian upbringing but
at the same time i think he was later um he um also later from his you know his path as a sufi
so he got into the sufi order oh and it's really wow yeah so the neoplatonism is quite strong in him
i sound like i sound like somebody talking about the force the neoplatonism is strong with him
absolutely so so yeah please keep keep going oh well i just wanted to ask so for you uh there was the
training that you know the proper way to do ifs is from a spiritual orientation where spirituality
means having this wise heart that is orienting you and acting as a sort of deeper conscience on
anything you're doing is that a fair way to talk about it i think because anything to me i experienced
that if i'm if if these if these things come from the heart they are life promoting and and they serve
life in this nietzschean sense so i i want i want to slow down here because i i know what you're saying
but i know what a lot of people can hear when they hear come from the heart they just mean a deep
impulse or something that they really like right and you're not saying that you're taking you're talking
about something very different you're talking about agape and you're talking about an orientation
to forgiveness in both senses of the word and you're talking about trying to be wisely connected
to yourself exactly embodied as you said last time to other people also listen to the community and be
open to correction i want to make sure that that's what you are talking about is that correct thank you
for clarifying this again i it's implicit and it makes sense for the audience to clarify it again
that's exactly right i'm not talking about the heart as this place where affective and emotional impulses
come right so yeah sometimes they can be part of it but yes i think there was a simpler way and you
talk about it in your work when you also even in in in your reference to heidegger it's it's about the
caring it's about yeah yeah the fun the caring that's just uh wrapped up with being yes a cognitive
being yes right and that's why i was talking about life you know things that promote life things that
promote existence and being and they they bring it also into being so yeah that exactly that's that's
the place what i'm you know when i'm talking about and um and one of the reasons why i like parts work and
before we talk about where it can you know promote self-deception is that it somehow restores our
you know capacity for potential john it's like say more about that that's really intriguing yeah so
that was actually i mean i had this you know i came to to ifs from this union background and it you
know it always sounded right that we are you know again not the masses of our own houses but
there was also something relieving you know there was a great relief in the fact that it's just a
part well i don't want to trivialize it but what i'm what i'm saying is that it isn't it's an answer to
our vices and deceptions actually when i when i if if there was a part of me that feels that way or
did that way there was always also the potential and capacity for different kind of things to
to to change and to to allow me to transform and to yeah and i think parts work in that sense is
really powerful because it it helps us to get out of this stuckness and fixation especially when it
comes to i just want to add this last thing yeah yeah please especially when it comes to like these
adjectival traits like what we mean in personality like the big five it said when i when i when i when
i um attribute these traits like no i'm lazy i am i don't know i'm or unorganized just framing the
language differently and saying well a part of me is lazy part of me is unorganized creates this
potential and i would say hope for different kind of things for variation so so i just want i sorry i
don't know no please go ahead so i mean i again with the sort of the the the neoplatonism of bringing
plato and aristotle back into this discussion where i think they should be um you know if you got you got
plato's idea about um if i can get the right inner justice or harmony or musicality between my parts
then they all can come to the overall greatest fulfillment and i can achieve a kind of profound
inner peace which liberates me from external self-deception because i my my dis my perception
and attention and cognition are not being twisted and thwarted by all this salience manipulation and
conflict inside there's that and then you took that and you said oh in an aristotle's proposal
that what we can do is we can cultivate traits that compensate for our personality or constitutional
deficits you know uh well well you know so uh you know i'm really introverted so i'll cultivate the
virtue of courage to to compensate that uh yeah to attain the golden mean right yes the golden mean
exactly and this idea that by doing that um i i release all kinds of potential uh for the kind
what's oh magnanimous i can become the great sold person yeah that's what the original meaning of
aristotle's term was like the great sold person uh the person of great anima right um not in the
youngian sense in the greek sense yes um and so i i think that's um well i think that's glorious what
you just said i think that's a great connection yeah and wonderful it's uh to connect you know
again to these great thinkers like aristotle and plato and um maybe this is also again a place where
we can dive a little bit more into this um neoplatonic maybe sufi kind of thinking because
again i came to the realization john you know just to reiterate and to um say it again the missing
piece to me was this heart kind of thing in a sense of caring but in the sufi sense of heart
you really i can really hear the like the sufism the the way of the heart um which is not the romantic
the way of emotion or impulse or you know anything like that yeah yeah yeah it's the place to me from
which the love to our embodiment to our community to our culture to nature and all ultimately to the
sacred comes from and it emanates and also emerges from and interestingly enough john recently i
independently of you know this thought process i realized later that there is that is really
congruent with this sufi kind of thinking because in these mystic traditions because they really view
the heart as this nexus right the bridge between the spirit and the soul between
ru and nafs nafas would be called the psuche the the right the the breath and yeah yeah yeah and we
still have that meaning of heart yeah uh even left in english language we talk about getting to the heart
of the matter yes right where we where the the thing that's holding it all together and keeping it alive
like yeah that very much too yes and also to add again to this layer you know um this dimension that
you mentioned which i think is spot on is that even to the self into reality there are there there are
levels to it there are layers to it right and this heart heart space as well there are layers to it
and um oh and that's is that part of the potential too uh so you know the idea that plato has this idea
when i start to get the inner harmony and i think ifs is about getting the inner harmony in a deep way
um uh you know i start to see more deeply outwardly into reality but i also like like mirror back
reflected back reflect yeah i also see more deeply into me than i could before and that unlocks potential
and and and and and that gets i get sort of the i get the meta virtue of sopherson i get this ability
to be more and more tempted by what's real and by what's good absolutely i create more in a piece and
that inner peace allows me to get again more into contact with reality with different layers of
reality and that again affords my inner work and transformation excellent then we have this
not the reciprocal narrowing but the opening in the anagoga that you talk the reciprocal so i think
that's that's really congruent to that and so i'm really looking forward to this ifs book especially
if it's bringing in these sufi themes thank you yeah he would also be a wonderful interlocutor he's um
i really respect his work and again he's you know my teacher and i learned a lot from him and he's
really open to these kind of things and i think lots of lots of the intellectual stuff that we talk
about are often implicit in the work that they're doing or that he does in the sense so yeah and and
again and to me that's the bridge to also to your question about spirituality because if it comes
from this you know if we learn the language of the heart in the sense that we're talking about we i
think automatically or naturally transcend this notion of sheer therapeutic method and technique
and we and to me that's a naturalistic account of spirituality too thank you for watching this
youtube and podcast series is by the verveki foundation which in addition to supporting my work
also offers courses practices workshops and other projects dedicated to responding to the meaning crisis
if you would like to support this work please consider joining our patreon you can find the link
in the show notes so wait this is also gold okay i want to just put i'm just going to put a couple
things to what you said with some of my language and see if this lands for you yes please so you've
got this idea that ifs is an imaginal dialogical learning the language of the heart and there that
that is inevitably a spiritual practice in some way how does that does that land for you it's hard for me to
well that absolutely lands i just want to say it's hard to not view it like that to me it's really
difficult to separate them i see i see but but again that's that's maybe a personal thing um i think
there are ways where we can like really strictly look at it from a therapeutical perspective but i think
it's like there's way more potential to it and i think in both senses like we have to be responsible
about this as well when we talk and when we um bring it into connection with spirituality because
again it opens up this whole pathway for spiritual bypassing which to me is again akin to your question
of self-deception within in this case within ifs yep right so and i i i concerned about that so i'm
glad you brought that up because i could see if ifs isn't done on the path of the heart it could very
much be the pathway to spiritual bypassing yes in a very significant way i could and i do have a concern
about that and so i but i think you've already given me a very good answer so we're getting into the
spirituality and before we do that i want to do evil yes uh which which is you know and and this
came up um not that the person can use ifs to engage in self-deception to which you have given a very
yeah beautiful answer i think a really beautiful answer but this other question is can the parts
themselves be deceptive can they lie to us can they bullshit us can they manipulate us for their own
survival whatever that means at our expense right and and a lot of people are concerned and of course
this concern comes up when those parts like hermes uh for me yeah become archetypal yeah um and and
claim to be um explicitly you know transjective in nature and things like that yeah that's a really
good question um i i'm thinking if i maybe if i if i'm i'm thinking if i should share my experience
first because i had a similar archetypal experience regarding this question and then it's up to you
like do do what you think i mean i don't want you to i don't want to expose you to expose yourself
psychologically unnecessarily but no i really thought about it if you think and i and i think
okay it's okay to share it because i think the truth is out i mean you know this phenomenology is
out there and maybe it's time to speak about these things so i i really thought about it it's okay i
mean good obviously i'm making myself vulnerable to this but you know i'm actually i i i try to follow
your lead there i mean you you spoke about your hermes and i think that was really courageous and
now i want to follow up with on this and so john when i thought about this question of self-deception
i really try to again and this is where ifs helped me try to you know remember the credo of ifs which
is all parts are welcome yeah and so what i what ultimately helped me was actually this kind of
approach in practice so i treated self-deception as a living thing let's call it part for a second
i treated i personified it imaginally as a living thing so that i can dialogue with it and i can i can
come into relationship with it and it was really interesting because at first john i was able to grasp
personal parts like the subjective parts that you know that apologize for their misdeeds because
they were thinking about you know sinning and doing things wrong and that was okay and and i was
you know i i set for this part in a you know curious manner and i you know i welcomed them and it was
okay and we could laugh about this stuff but i was quite clear on this that that i was saying like well
that's not what i'm looking for i'm not looking for the personal biographical you know you know you're
tainted by self-deception i'm trying to talk to self-deception oh yes that's oh wow just let me savor
that for a minute that is not only existentially brave that's brilliant oh well thank you
well it's it's i mean it's i'm i'm not i'm not lying about this it was really an experience and um
um and then it was interesting john then suddenly a force talked to me that didn't feel like a part
and it and it felt more archetypal and it spoke to me you know like um at first it sounded a little bit
more like an oracle but it had this you know it had this poetic language to it and and i really tried
to make an effort to grasp it understand it and in ifs terms you would say befriended right i really tried
to befriended and see and get curious about what it has to tell me and to really understand its
role and purpose and then it spoke to me john it said it said to me um how can you realize the really
real and significant things without me how can you love and forgive without me what can you love if not
for the illusion what can you forgive if not for the sin how can you build responsibility without
errors tell me who will carry this burden if not me oh i was like okay what the hell yeah the proper
response yes and john it was really interesting because this figure really on the one hand it it
it's you know it talked to me with great might power and grace so it was numinous for you even yes
yeah and yeah and at the same time it also it it it had the side this right it was it also came from a
place of exhaustion it's part of it i think it felt like the burden that that this you know archetypal
thing is carrying but also from the ungratefulness that we have towards it i see so what i then realized
in that moment john was that it's really a life force again it's something that promotes life and it's
not something that deprives life and i think to me that's the response to your question of evil
it's like this whole being
well okay let's let's before we go the next step so i mean this is what came up for me
this is what came up for me is the very things that make us adaptive make us prone to self-deception
yeah and our deepest self-deception can actually disclose to us the depths of what it is that
makes us adaptive yes and without that self-knowledge we can't actually properly flourish how does that
land for you that absolutely lands because again i think there is this deep ontological reality attached
to it that i think we both propagate um or you know promote and it's that reality is fundamentally
relational yes and and this encounter with this with self-deception let's call it
the spirit of self-deception exactly it's a spirit exactly it really you know i
i it really made me realize that we that through self-deception and through let's say sinning that
we attain first of all consciousness but also that we really learn to love and that we learn humility
and that we learn for forgiveness in this agapic sense so it really made its point that you know don't
kid yourself i am important and there is no way around it and then john it hit me then i then i thought
about it um but i will give you a chance to come comment on this sorry well no first of all i i i
i mean there's a strain in christian theology i don't know if there's anything like it in sufism
sort of about the idea of the benefit of the fall yeah that if human beings didn't fall they would
have never achieved self-consciousness yes and without receiving self-consciousness they could not
actually they they would they would have the image of god but they could not come into the like they
could not be like god and is it is it similar to milton's lucifer kind of um i i i'm not sure i i don't
i don't know if i'd say that but it's it's more the idea that so they're very careful about this the
the fall is a fall it is an act of sin but if that sin hadn't have happened then human beings couldn't have
lost their innocence and without losing their innocence they would have never become capable
of being um well being properly godlike they had to be tempted by godhood in order to be come godlike
if i can put it that way well yeah oh that's good that's really good yeah um and and and it's it i mean
it's a powerful idea and uh like many powerful ideas within the heart of a religious framework
it's deeply paradoxical because it sounds like the fall is necessary which means god wanted it to
happen and then how could it be a sin yeah because of god's making it like and you get into all of
these things and i'm not going to comment on that because i can't thread i and i don't know anybody who
gets out of this but this idea this idea that we face this sort of primordial original sin
right that actually launches us into the path of virtue in some profound way and this is although
i know i don't know if it's in milton it's clearly in blake yeah blake has this idea running through his
poetry yes yes you're right and i was thinking maybe maybe it's not about solving this paradox and this is
also again something i learned from jung because some things need to be you know we can't solve them
we have to outgrow them and to me self-deception was ex that's exactly what i you know what i
realized that it's like well there's no way around it we have to experience it maybe we even have to
experience remorse so that we can practice forgiveness so that to me was this deep realization
and again i'm not you know now we can get into more theoretical um understandings of my experiences
but and i'm not trying to equivocate or sound deep in any sense i what i'm trying to articulate is that
if the deepest ontological reality is relational and in this sense of aletheia in heidegger's sense
right it's yeah and it's a relationship between sufficiently differing aspects like the eidos
right and themselves being relationships and then we are again in this argument of this blue line
then in some and in some cases even opposites complete opposites then in order for relationship
and let's see how you think about this john in order for relationships to make sense
we need to validate the things that the relation binds right so they have to be real too and to me
this is what i also understand with ratio religio um i i hope that i understand it correctly but
what do you think about this um i i think that's i think so far i'm agreeing with you i i i
except um i would i mean and i've been doing this because i've been i've gone through uh
filler's book in the course on ultimate reality god and beyond and um i and i don't know if james
thinks this or not and i'm looking forward to talking to him about it but you don't want to
simply invert what i mean by that is you don't want to say well it's the it used to be the relata
from which the relations emerge and you don't want to say no it's the relations from which the
relata merge it's just inverting and all of the arguments that destroy the first position
symmetrically destroy the second position you want to say pure relationality is that which is below
the relations and the relata and from yeah yeah yes yes and from which it but it's not a substance
yes right because it's pure relationality it is that from which the relations and the relata
co-emerge and then that means it is like the spirit that is flowing through the emergence and the
emanation completely interpenetrating up and down yes that's that's how i would okay that that makes
to me a lot of sense and i don't think it's um i don't even see an argument against what i said which
is good um if i'm not mistaken because i'm not arguing for the hierarchy i think that absolutely
you're right it's it's below that right i was thinking would you agree that um the things that
are bound and linked by the relation um that they also then necessarily have to be real and valid too
would you agree with yes and this is one of the pro this is one of the issues i have uh with sort
of some notions of pure relationality that if you don't have any point where the relate where the
relationality bends on itself like the noose in the new in relationship to the neoplatonic one then you
just get this homogenous like the one of parmenides right which is just this homogenous sphere with no
that is no different from nothingness um yeah i agree there there has to be a and you know this is
where i think i have a lot of criticisms of whitehead but this is where whitehead's idea that yes it's
like that but the mini become the one that adds to the mini right and then goes back and you got this
sort of flowing accordion holographic fractal thing going on rather than just this homogenous blob
thing going on yeah that's wonderful and and you know well i have i have something to ask you just
hold your thought take a moment to get your thought i don't want to just i don't want to draw it out of
your head but you know i've been and this comes from nishida i was thinking about and proclus's idea
about the one within is the vehicle of the one without and we were talking about the self last yes
not as a thing or a substance but more like a field of pure relationality and i was thinking
you know maybe what can happen in ifs is you can move to the participation in that which gives you a
way of understanding by participating knowing by coupling knowing by participating ultimate reality as
pure relationality it's not identical but it is a deep realization by participation what what do you
think of that i was actually thinking about exactly the same thing that's the thought that i was
holding i was trying to bring in the oh wow okay what you said makes sense to me the context that you
give or gave um a second ago gives meaning to what kirk god says with the self right it's it's
self that relates itself to itself in that sense it really makes sense that even this thing like thing is
the relationship that relates itself to itself yeah yeah yes yes and to me and now to again to answer
the question of how we can deceive ourselves within ifs i would say one of the fundamental mistakes people
i don't want to say mistakes because again it's the language of training whereas the language of
explanation so um but i still see problems with it even in a practical sense um when they again when
there is this reification of the self and they and they yeah yeah it becomes an idol with the with the
self again it's something as a part and then what happens typically john is in ifs practices people get
into this push away kind of mentality to push away apart to get to the self as if it's and i think that's
this that's this really it's it's seductive but in a in a bad sense like it's really seductive to think
like this but i think that really is the self-deception often going on in ifs oh that's that's that's
brilliant so the idea is that like if the self is this pure relationality that properly orients us
towards reality because it participates in the grammar of reality we can lose that by trying to turn the
self back into a substance and then turning it into an idol and then we get in totally the wrong
even though we're talking the word self we get into totally the wrong framing that is what is most
crucial about the self not what is framed but the way you're participating in a fundamental framing
exactly is that absolutely oh that and okay and now again talking about the traps and gaps of of parts
work i i think i have a problem with parts work when when um parts are used as a scapegoat
for avoiding real responsibility i brought that up and that's that's a species of the spiritual
bypassing kind of thing too where uh you know i did i bring that up with mark i think i brought that
up with mark lewis and i said i can see people using that to divest themselves of their moral
responsibility well that wasn't me that was this exactly that's exactly the old joke yeah yeah
and that's the old joke of the devil made me do it kind of thing and i think that is deeply
problematic because by definition that is something you want to address because when you say something
like that first of all you cannot just dissociate apart from your own agency right i mean you could but
that it would be either pathological like in dissociative this identity disorder and complex trauma
where this can happen but then it's a pathology right or it's really self-deception and i think
that's one of the points so um so that's why i personally try to limit parts language to when i'm
in situations of you know emotional upheaval and where i feel like my framing and my agency is hijacked
by a part in the sense that you talk about when you talk about parasitic processing yeah you know in
jungian theory you would say when you're gripped or possessed by a complex right complex yeah and
then in ifs you have to step the stepping back move that you do with your glasses too we call it
unblending right so you try to unblend from it yep but the problem there's also problem in unblending
though in my opinion it's like well just as a stepping back move you know can't account for
everything i still have to step back in right i have to get into a part again to me and this is something
i mean i might be wrong and people you know with more experience in ifs might disagree with me but
that's okay i what i see often is that well i still have to act in the world right we are enacted
beings right our cognition is enacted right so my part still has to do the job well and to use the
glasses metaphor you have to put the glasses back on and look through the part and see if you can now
see the world differently because then something has changed yes that's fundamental and to stick
with the analogy i would say when you you know take off your glass and you you look at you know smudges
and you which is akin to the self-deception and you try to wipe them away you put them back on
you still have the same thing but you have a different quality right and to me this is what um um to me
that describes what people talk about in ifs when you talk about being self-led right it's a quality
it's not a thing right it's there's no things to it yeah it's a functional we talked about this that
it probably has to do with these two platonic things about you know bringing about inner peace and
bringing you into connectedness with reality affording anagoga exactly affording agape that's what it is
it's it's something like that exactly and and to me this captures better the idea of the self as this
very process and product of optimal gripping and self-organization yeah right so no self beyond
self-organization or i think you you um compared it to the metaxu and and i think it's the inner logos
then when it maybe could yeah i don't know i've recently discovered um the work of william desmond and
uh he built an entire like oh impressive profound ontology around metaxu oh um i'm just diving very
deeply into it deeply influenced by plato um really astonishing um and uh he he's got the ad what is it
metaxological metaxological um as a um and he proposes it as that is what what's sort of beyond the
hegelian dialectic um and so i i what i'm why why did i say that because i think we're doing this
we're and i mean this in the right way we're doing something like the theology of the metaxu here and
we're trying to bring it into a deeper and we're arguing for a deeper and more proper apprehension and
appreciation of what's going on in ifs that's what that's what i was yes uh trying to articulate can
you john can you put the it's a book right the metaxu one there's i recommend there's the william
desmond reader can you put it into the reading list also i don't have anything to write it yeah yeah
yeah okay that would be great i would love to look into this and if you allow john i just want to you
know circle back to the to my encounter with the with the spirit of self-deception yeah because we
were talking it's it's i just wanted to note it was interesting that the spirit of self-deception
spoke to you sounds like very truthfully which is a really interesting sort of meta move but keep going
well yeah that's actually that was also a feeling i was thinking about this if it's you know maybe it
was a trickster archetype something like because you have it like low-key and different kind of god yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's totally totally who knows if it was right so but we're talking about
this right so we're trying to figure out these things together you know you know collective
intelligence here and um so uh you agreed that the thing that the relationship binds then necessarily
also have to be true right so then i would say if they said real before yeah real yeah yeah exactly
real and i then i was thinking if they are real then i should attend to it
yes if they are real i should attend to that's why i'll try to have a conversation with this that's
a good point yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and
and and and ultimately my realization was that there is no reality without illusion
and illusion isn't necessary for reality and vice versa right so and they're relevant to each other
well i mean this is a taoist move you're making uh but it also goes to uh um i i've just finished a
course on the primacy of beauty that i've taught um and this idea that uh real is a comparative term
yes and illusion are and and and as comparatives they are they're they are bound something is only
real in comparison to something less real an illusion and something is only an illusion in
relation to something that's more real and you can't you can't just saying something like
saying everything's an illusion is like saying everything is tall but it would equally be wrong
if i'm hearing you right to say everything is real because that would be like saying everything is
tall too yeah what i'm trying to allude to again and maybe again no no and heidegger has that right
by the way right yeah heidegger has that being is both the unconcealment and the concealment at the
same time it's the shining forth and it's always also the withdrawal into mystery yeah and this and
this withdrawal this shining forth and the withdrawal i was thinking about this in a union sense interesting
enough because yeah understanding you hopefully correctly means that if if things work into two
directions then it's not about the poles he could you i know that you talk about it's the it's about
the polarity and i was thinking about the polarity it's the force field it's the force field not the
pole and i'm hearing young say well if they work into two directions then then the goal is the center
uh right right right right right that's something i also associated with this um you know this deep
wisdom by heidegger and again maybe we can turn it into something practical also for the audience so it
doesn't stay as this kind of theoretical intellectual please and maybe from a therapeutic perspective
that you know to make things really real now and so it also doesn't sound like a dpd okay yeah yeah
as you might as you might know and i'm i'm sure you know that there is deep and persistent
there is a deep and persistent search for meaning in the state of trauma people who are traumatized
have like pdsd they really try to figure out what this beast is right they ask what's they really ask
about the meaning of this and and if you want or if i want to make sense and draw meaning and significance
from my trauma then maybe i can manage to understand my trauma as a force that wants to communicate
something to me as a messenger and and this is actually really something i do with my trauma
patients then oh i see well i i really try it's it's it's by understanding these that these events
can potentially be relevant to your transformation to your growth i can by just framing this relationship
like that i can enter into a different kind and quality of relationship to my trauma yeah yeah
and and then in this relationship and the quality of the relationship lies the transcendence and then i
can and then patients and often clients can overcome that trauma because again in a hermeneutic style
they can make sense out of it they can draw meaning out of it and it's exactly this reframing of the
relationship that take that also can take away the power of the trauma and hand it back to the client
and hand back the agency so if you ask me john because that that's to me ultimately what trauma is i
mean what it's a lot of things but it's it's a displaced i would say a displaced or disturbed and
or maybe in your words parasitic hermeneutic process right right so right it's a loop and and it's not
an event the trauma is not an event and it's also not in the event it's in the relationship of me and
the world and how i make sense of myself and the world and it keeps does that land with you does that
make sense that yeah yeah that that yeah and i'm getting that this looping it takes on a life of its
own yes and and that's how it sucks agency away from the person that's traumatized yes this is
landing very well for me keep going please yes and i think um in in very complex cases again that
becomes difficult with ifs to be really honest i think then you really really need a you know ecology
of practices not only ifs but there is a way in ifs you know ifs really found a way to address this
being frozen in time in this loop right that's the unburdening process and going to the exiles and
and it's this updating right it's it's this reframing and again it's a harmony again i i
would call it the hermeneutic process because you're trying to draw meaning of it and you know
yeah attend to it and i again i would say in it from an agapic position yeah by you know attending to
it from a from a place of love so that again something opens up so you can
so you can put the memory into its into the different into the right kind of
i don't know i don't know what the right word well it's it's ratio it's the properly proportioning and
prioritization of things in the correct perspective and from the correct participatory
standpoint it's deep logos yes it's that proper proportioning that we expect from the reasonable
person that's what it is it makes it reasonable it makes their it doesn't mean they get all
instantly happy but now they are back in having a reasonable orientation that allows them to properly
process uh this yes is that what you i like when you when you're struggling for this language of
proportion yeah because i've been trying i've been trying i've given up because i've given up trying
to get people to use the word rational to this broader notion other than logical and so i'm saying
well we have this other word we use reasonable and we don't mean logical we mean like in the court of
law you you have to do what the reasonable person would do what does a reasonable person do well they
take the right perspective so they prioritize the right things they see things in the right proportion
and they participate as they properly should and that's what i'm talking yes and even from that
perspective even logic takes a different kind of meaning because it then yeah you can understand
that it's deeply uh bound to the idea of logistics right to distributing our resources
yes we have this optimal grip again and this harmony i would exactly exactly exactly i said like this
rational proportioning that really that that was the word i was struggling with to find so yeah thank
you um yeah it's it's crazy so i i mean i think you've given some like really i mean this beautiful
answers and i love i love uh like so you know i i love talking to all everybody about this i mean i'm
talking to you know uh seth allison about this and he's coming in with this deep you know deep
reflection uh from from the psychotherapeutic which you have of course do and then you know and mark
like you has this deep psychotherapeutic perspective but you know but he also has this cognitive
scientific thing that i share with yeah right but now john just to you know just to mention my work on
self-organized criticality intersects with mark lewis's work by the way oh yeah so i i know i briefly
talked to him um via mail and um because his lab in in in the netherlands i'm actually doing research
with them so that's interesting we not only there is not a not only an overlap in ifs in the therapeutic
sense but also even from the cognitive scientific perspective so i'm sorry i just wanted to add that
no no no i think that's good and i mean i think we should have at least one more conversation
um before um we're sort of going to wrap up our voices for vaki um but i'd like to have one more
with you and i don't want to completely lose the thread with everything we've been talking about but
i do want to have that conversation with you around your uh self-organizing criticality work
and what the connections are between that um yeah i would love that all this stuff and i you know i
have a lot of connections between self-organizing criticality and the cognitive science i do and
you're totally right to mention mark lewis um so let's let's let's have you come back and do at
least that uh because i don't want to we're almost out of time so i don't want to start that now i don't
want to start that now but i do want to do what i always do first of all i want to thank you
uh like i was saying you and i you you bring in the therapeutic and you have the cognitive scientific but
you also have the like a deep philosophical spiritual side of this that resonates very very
deeply with me and i'm very appreciative of that um and so i just wanted to i thank you and uh thank
you for being courageous about like opening up and making yourself vulnerable don't pay any attention to
the horrible trolls that say stupid uh because you did that uh because they'll do that no matter what you
do you just have to ignore them but pay attention to a lot of the people that a lot of people that are
encouraged that are encouraged by you opening up and saying we need to talk about this stuff
because it happens and it really happens and it really transforms people and we need to get the
new language to talk about it correctly in order to deal with what's happening in the meaning crisis
and the advent of the sacred so i want to thank you you you participated and contributed to that
very significantly thank you john that really means a lot to me and again to be able to share this
with you and to have a forum to speak to speak about these things for these things but also together
with you is i think there is nothing that is more meaningful to me and just you know socrates says
yeah sorry go ahead no i was going to say socrates says you know participating in genuine dialogos
is the best life that we can actually live i would 100 agree with this and i just wanted to say to
the trolls i mean i'm i don't want to be too i don't want to participate in hubris and to be too arrogant
but i'm not too afraid because i know that the proof is in the pudding and i think i would speak with
less confidence if i didn't see the merits and also the the success in the work that i'm doing with
the students at university the community that i'm in but also with this again the severely impaired
people that i work in on a daily basis and so that is reassuring to again to open at least open the
dialogue in this conversation and we know we both don't claim to have the answer and we it's still
an ongoing right so but um at least let's you know keep the ball rolling
so uh the phrase is uh uh the proof is in the eating of the pudding and you are deeply uh you
said some very delicious things here today and i wanted to thank you for that thank you i always like
to give my uh my guests um the last word and it can be whatever kind of word you want inspiration
summation provocation whatever whatever you'd like to say it i think it's not so much my nature to you
know provoke people or you know to say something provocative um i will say i would love to continue
the series and to talk to you again and also again to bring some of my colleagues and other thinkers like
robin bear just as an example because we promised the audience last time that we want to talk about
the triple a like um the adult the archetype of the adolescent and also work right and yes i just
want to say maybe we can keep it at that i'm looking forward to this conversations conversations
yeah good we'll make that one happen too we'll make that one happen i'm not going to stop having
conversations we're just putting voices with raveiki uh into retirement i will still have you know
individual conversations uh and dialogues uh but but uh thank you so so much thank you john really
yeah i hope we get to meet in person someday i think that would be really wonderful i hope that's
we will
