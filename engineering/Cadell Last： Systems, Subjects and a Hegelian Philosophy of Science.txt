this episode think about like what evolutionary scientists observe like i always was fascinated
when i was in originally i was in primatology and i was reading these field notes i actually
went to africa for two summers to study chimpanzees but i was reading these primatological field notes
of like which are always get left out of the scientific papers of like what they saw
like they would see like for example like uh infant they would see an infanticide
right like they would see infanticide they would see rape they would see war when watching the
chimpanzees but they would just be collecting data as external like and you would get like these
scientific reports about like rates of infanticide in this chimpanzee group or rates of you know murder
in this chimpanzee group or something like a very cold analysis but i'm saying that evolutionary
biologists and anthropologists they're super aware of the brutality of nature but they can but
they're always studying it from an external point of view like it's not like they aren't getting raped
like their kid isn't like their kid isn't being killed right they're studying it from an external
point of view but the challenge here and this is like the deep challenge i think of hegelian science
is what is hegelian science it's that the interesting thing about science is that it
changes from pre-modern philosophy where pre-modern philosophy is just contemplating substance
and and modern science is testing substance it's testing it it's experimenting with it but where the
limits of modern science are the difference between modern science and hegelian science is that you
don't have to you you can't only test substance you have to test substance and subject it's not
only substance it's also subject so you're in the system you are under the test your subjectivity is
the test hey everyone welcome to this conversation with the philosopher teacher certainly a teacher for
me and the founder of philosophy portal dr caddell last this was a far-ranging dialogue and i've got
to say um i truly was honored to have caddell on um i've mentioned caddell uh offline that initially
years ago when i started getting into jackie and hegelian philosophy it was his um series or his
lecture series on uh jack's less than nothing that really helped me understand the work i mean it's a
dense text in fact if you haven't seen it this is jack's tone i mean it's the kind of book that
you read for a lifetime and funny enough uh i was kind of propagandizing or pushing propaganda let's
say uh for caddell and also on behalf of caddell for him to uh do a uh a philosophy portal course on
this book in particular less than nothing um trying to study jack's work and it's funny i was asking
for another course while he's in the middle of uh the christian atheism course now the reason i'm
mentioning all of this is because well i assume um caddell might not be a stranger to you if you've
been following my work on this channel for a while i've mentioned this work and a lot of the guests
that have been on the podcast were also on caddell's podcast philosophy portal um and i think there's a
lot of uh intermingling between the kind of the things we're interested in but also i would say you
know i still consider myself very much a student of what caddell does but uh he did mention that in
many ways we have the same uh intellectual development as to how we got interested in this
kind of lacanian hengelian philosophy uh this kind of theory scene that you see really growing online
uh because like caddell i am i too am very much interested in the natural sciences and i would say in
many ways so much of my philosophy is really a philosophy of science and that's what i'm
interested in um and caddell started off in anthropology and moved on to more of his work
in philosophy which perfectly brings us to this book systems and subjects thinking the foundations
of science and philosophy by caddell last uh primarily despite it being a far-ranging conversation
we did discuss this work by caddell and we touched on how hegelian philosophy what's its
pertinent or what insights it can give us uh about science and the philosophy of science and how to
think of these foundations especially uh in systems theory and how we can think of subjectivity when
trying to understand systems as such and certainly caddell just do that uh in this book by incorporating
the work of the biologist virgin laffey and bringing that work into dialogue with uh more cornal
philosophy like hegel heidegger and of course lacone and jack certainly um i should also mention uh the
recent publication by philosophy portal logic for the global brain now it is also a bit of a tome so
i still haven't got gotten into it but i'm certainly looking forward to diving into this book too um
just just so much the ideas here resonate with what i viscerally feel inside and what i see in the world so
i i i am hoping one day i don't know if i should say this publicly that uh i'll be at a point where
i can even contribute to a work like this by philosophy portal um i did really enjoy reading uh the editor's
note and the forward uh by daniel gana from og rose uh and i'm already intrigued let's say i'm already
sold on the book so although we didn't really discuss much of this apart from kind of discussing caddell's
phd thesis um a lot of this was really a work on the philosophy of science i just got distracted by
someone banging loudly outdoors i don't know what's going on anyway don't worry about it uh yes this
work was mostly on the philosophy of science um and how again hegelian philosophy or that way of thinking
subjectivity uh should be brought into how we think of science uh now look as you can see i'm kind of
blabbering now there's a lot i can say on caddell has work and the influence he's had on me uh so
all i can say is look i'm hoping this is the start of many more dialogues to come uh and please go tweet
at caddell go and tweet at him go and comment on his videos do a philosophy portal course on less than
nothing keep tweeting at him spam him email him and then eventually he'll get to it uh all right before
we continue uh as per usual a quick psa you may be aware that i've mentioned multiple times i'll never
have advertisers or sponsors on this podcast i simply don't have anything to sell you and i deeply do
believe that we live in a society of excess and over consumption and i don't want to contribute to
that by selling you more things that being said though forgive the tautology we ultimately live in
the world we live in and i can't continue this project and sustain it if i don't have any kind of
financial support so as uncomfortable as this makes me feel i sincerely would like to ask you to
consider supporting this podcast financially needless to state your listenership and membership is more
than enough support however if you have the means please do consider supporting me on patreon
sub stack or even paypal and if you're wondering what are the perks what are you going to get
nothing absolutely nothing because i'm not selling you anything you're not buying anything but rather
if this podcast if the work i've done has brought you any kind of value if you've learned something
new do consider supporting me on these platforms but to reiterate only if you have the means all right
back to the episode as i was saying in that note i recently did start a patreon account so do consider
supporting my work if you found any value here at all uh there are no perks there is there's nothing
behind the paywall it's not me trying to sell you anything it's simply if you think my work is worth
paying for the free work that's out there so yes i'd really be grateful if you could do that um i get
really weird asking for money it's just anyway i'm sure i'll get over this uh a bit of a formal introduction
to karela last dr karela last is an anthropologist and hagelian philosopher who is interested in
biocultural evolution mind-matter relations and speculative futures his phd thesis global brain
singularity focuses on all three of these topics he's the author of systems and subjects enter the
alien and many other interdisciplinary books dr karela last has taught multiple courses on hegel's
science of logic sigmund freud's unconscious alan kazupanchek's what is sex as also the founder of
philosophy portal an education platform focused on teaching the foundational philosophical discourses
of the modern world with that being said here's my conversation with karela last cool karela uh yeah
as i said thanks for being here um i am i've been looking forward to this for a while uh not to flatter
you too much but uh as i as i told you years ago uh i used your uh series on jx less than nothing
uh your your free series to really it was just a real uh resource of education for me to understand
the work of zizek but not just reject but even kind of at the time this sort of speculative hegelian the
way of thinking um and like how to think the negative how to how to think logic and so on um so
that being said though uh what i probably want to discuss today as we planned is your book uh systems
and subjects which i know isn't your latest book uh however it's funny i was i was thinking
adrian johnston uh who you'd know uh in one of his older interviews he said that it's really hard
uh writing a book on zizek especially because a living right doing work on a living thinker the living
thinker is living and thinking uh and that's how i felt like preparing for this podcast because
you're also currently doing your thinking publicly so i have a set of questions i wanted to ask you
last month but now it's they've changed because you're doing your own thinking um and you do it so
publicly and so you could be on the theory underground podcast or you could be your own podcast uh but i think
it behooves me to ask you this question because it's at the center of your consciousness right now
which is uh the christian christian atheism course and i think it's a good place to
for the listeners who aren't familiar with your work just to see the kind of thinker you are and
the kind of problems you work through so if you could tell us i mean it's ongoing right now isn't it
so what is yeah what is the christian christian atheism course and what made you kind of yeah
develop a whole course around this this concept yeah well look it's great to be here i think
you're really doing great work and i'm excited to see sort of how your own thinking continues to
develop and i i and i know how difficult it is also to uh do the type of work you're doing and the
amount of time and effort it takes to to to to pull off these podcasts so you know in some sense
you know just also just throwing back to you recognizing you for the the work you're doing
and i think that there aren't that many podcasts where i see the person hosting the podcast put in
the amount of back work that i know needs to go in to really bring philosophy to this level of
of discourse and so i think it's it's really important work that you're doing as well so
let me just say right off the bat that
i think the easiest is following a dead thinker the the the the let's say the the medium difficulty
is following a living thinker that you don't know and the most difficult is following a living
thinker that you also know and i think that level of difficulty is is is the challenge today and i
think it is actually connected to the ideas that i'm unpacking and exploring with the concept of
christian atheism which by the way keeps on giving and giving to me in terms of myself exploring this
concept i'm finding i'm finding that as i continue to develop this concept within the context of the
course i'm i'm learning something new and revolutionizing my thought almost every day
so it's i'm in a really interesting spot with with the concept and i want to bring that to the
forefront so let me connect the central idea that i'm trying to develop in christian atheism with what
i just said about the easiest is to follow the dead thinker the medium difficulty is to follow the living
thinker and the hardest is to follow the living thinker that you also have a relationship with
i think that what's revolutionary about christianity is the concept of the trinity
and actually i just finished watching the movie there will be blood i don't know if you've seen
that movie there will be blood but in the movie there will be blood it's set basically at the end of
the 19th century beginning of the 20th century during the oil rush and there's this central
tension in the movie between someone who's um basically a pioneer in the oil industry and this
local priesthood this local pastor who's running a small church congregation out in the desert
and this tension between them is is fascinating it is in some sense a christian atheist tension in the
movie that's being dramatized between the the the the guy who's a pioneer in the oil industry who you
could say is the atheist and this christian pastor who's who's running a small town pastor in the desert
and this pastor is basically using the trinity in an extremely superstitious and i would say non-philosophical
way in the sense that he is completely leaving the uh trinity shrouded in obscurantist representation
and mystery and ultimately this causes his own undoing and i think that what i'm trying to do with the concept of christian atheism is
raise the concept of the trinity to a philosophical concept
so that it can actually be thought by secular subjectivity which is i think allergic to the type of
obscurantist representations which
often are are characteristic of pre-modern religious subjectivity so the father is something that i'm trying
to relate to as basically the concept of the big other the son is basically something i'm trying to relate
to as a form of subjective destitution and the holy spirit is something i'm trying to relate to as basically
a type of network subjectivity which is increasingly i think necessary today and perhaps relevant to
the idea of systems and subjects in terms of what i was saying about the level of difficulty of following
a dead thinker living thinker and living thinker you know i think that following a dead thinker is
basically having a big other right it's having a father and the reason why the father or the dead thinker
is is is in that is in that position of the father is because the father doesn't actually exist
the father the father is in some sense imaginary and that's why it's easier that's why it's easiest
to sort of have sort of to follow a dead thinker because you don't have to really contend with the
living thought of that thinker that thinker can remain in some sense an imaginary representation at a
distance and it can remain an ideal and it can remain an ideal that's never shattered and thus
it can remain an ideal that keeps you away from your own subjective destitution because what do
people always say when they say don't meet your idols when they say don't meet your idols it means
that you're risking subjective destitution in the sense that your idolization will collapse
right if you keep the idol at a distance and it will convenient if the person is dead because you'll
never have a chance to meet them anyway but if you actually meet your idol and this idealization
collapses actually what you're scared of is your own sort of inner world collapsing which is sustained
by this idealization which is sustained by this figure of the big other so you're keeping at a distance
the possibility of subjective destitution and then finally to follow a living thinker i think is to
constantly be challenged with rethinking um and and re like like you just said like the questions you
wanted to ask me last month are not the questions that you want to ask me now and perhaps next month
there'll be another set of you know and if we continue relating for years there'll be transformations
on both of our sides that's network subjectivity that's whatever image we have of each other uh is
is is is should be broken like it that's because it's not the living word uh the living word is the
living word and and whatever image you have is is only going to be an approximate representation of
of of of what that person actually is in in in the life of their concept so i think really what i'm
trying to go towards here is with this idea of the trinity is how can we actually think philosophically
let's say the living word or the life of the concept in the reality of network subjectivity and it
could even be possible that let's say i'm increasingly using network subjectivity and juxtaposing it against
institutional subjectivity because it could be that institutional subjectivity
is upheld by a figure of the big other whether it be a professor whether it be a certain idealization of
professional attainment some certain upward direction that is idealized which if it works
and this is i think the interesting paradox if institutional subjectivity works meaning you're able to
build your career in the institution you can actually live your entire life without really
encountering directly subjective destitution because the institution takes care of you and right so i i've
met many forms of subjectivity working within the university system where i've increasingly got this
perspective informed by christian atheism that there's a form of negativity that people in the institutions
seem permanent that they keep permanently at a distance and that's not to say that someone who spent
their entire life in the institution can't experience subjective destitution it's just that the institution
creates a nice containment which reduces the probability of subjective destitution in some sense like
of course you could still experience an absolute catastrophe in your life that brings you to your
knees and absolutely transforms your you know your subjective position but the institution also functions
as a kind of defense against the possibility of subjective destitution so in some sense i think that the
reason why christianity is becoming popular again or the reason why it's becoming intellectually people are
becoming intellectually curious about religion in general and maybe christianity and specifically
is because i think there's also a crisis in the institutions and uh it could be that people are
finding themselves encountering something like subjective destitution and also wondering um about this weird
notion of holy spirit which i think presents us with a form of organization which is other to let's say
institutional structure yeah i mean there was a lot there i mean i think the part i want to focus a
bit more on is the notion of the big other uh and also which i really like i already took note of this which
is where you say that you analogize uh the holy spirit uh with networks to use you know system science
language now firstly uh to discuss to talk about the big other so i think in some sense uh maybe now
there's a slight shift in the zeitgeist uh so to speak it's this notion of like science as the big other
right i mean when i mean science is a big other it's important to state that uh okay let me let me
it's okay uh an example of this would be the the new atheist uh four horsemen i i'm i know for a fact
when i was a teenager a lot of my friends who were interested in this topics their big other were
they were either sam harris or richard dawkins these two figures um christopher hitches a bit
a bit before even my time and then daniel dennett he was more philosopher wasn't really but sam harris
especially with his like you know uh what's this the meditation kind of secularized spirituality side
of him and then richard dawkins which is just like pure you know hard science um and and the problem
though is and this again goes back to this something where in this book uh systems and science uh sorry
systems and subjects where this notion of the interior life so your first chapter is dasein's
interior which is the chapter i read most closely because i think that's that's the part where a lot
of these topics of having a big other or subjective institution they speak to this notion of that the
interior life um so this is a long way of me asking um how can we how can we understand what you're
trying to introduce this thing called the interior life to our current uh conversation our current
dialogue that that's going on amongst the kind of the new atheist or kind of people that are working
through this kind of secular rationale you know stephen pinker that type of thinkers how so let me put
another way uh sean carroll uh i remember in one of his books uh the big picture i think he says that
humans are blobs of organized mud now he just says it abstractly he makes this statement right but
see that the problem is brilliant physicist but you just don't get it none of us experience life as
blobs of organized mud you're like there's you can tell me that all i am is a blob of organized mud but
how can you like i wake up in the morning and i look at my life i don't experience life like a blob of
organized mud like that's a in some sense a meaningless statement i don't even know what
that means so i guess my question would be for for the kind of the the big other of our time which
is like scientifically driven thinkers how can we think the subject how can we speak of this the
interior life without falling into some kind of new age spiritualism you know jungian archetypes that kind
of kind of you know where jordan peterson has gone where he's trying to convince richard dawkins that
dragons are real you know so there was a lot there i know but uh i'm just curious to hear your thoughts
on that because i think without a doubt the christian atheism project is is is is is at a philosophical
level trying to introduce this notion of the interior life into more of these uh uh questions that are
ongoing in that in our kind of intellectual milieu yeah yeah okay so i can i can definitely work with
this and for the context for people who are interested in getting into systems and subjects
when you ask the question how can we think the subject my approach to thinking the subject and
systems and subjects is basically the challenge of taking
system science as an interdisciplinary field par excellence and basically forming a dialectical
meta-dialogue throughout the whole book between system science as an interdisciplinary science
and continental philosophy because i think continental philosophy and so that's like that's like on a low
key like that's structuring the whole book is a conversation constantly between these two
disciplines in some sense that represents systems and subjects like a system science represents
thinking systems in a scientific interdisciplinary way and subjects is basically i'm trying to get at
the nature of the subject through the history of continental philosophy which i think provides us with
the resources to to precisely think the subject in a non-regressive non-reductive way so in terms of why
the book starts with interior life in some sense the book starts with interior life so that we can get to a form of
exteriority which is not excluding the subject but actually lifting the subject up so i think that's the
the problem with a lot of science is that science doesn't start again the type of science you were
mentioning richard dawkins evolutionary biology uh sean carroll quantum physics or general relativity and
sam harris neuroscience all of those forms of science do not really start with a they don't start with the
interiority so they're not starting there now i'm not ending there right i'm starting there and that
that's the point of starting there in the book is is again to start like and and where you start where
your origin is is is important i think that the presupposition of classical science and the
presupposition of physics the presupposition of evolutionary biology the presupposition of
neuroscience it starts with an external gaze right either an external gaze of the universe the
beginning is the big bang or so forth or it starts with the origin of life the beginning is single-celled
organisms or it starts with the brain neuronal connections and wirings and so forth and then
builds up from there but you're never going to understand the interiority of the subject
you're from starting from that external point of view it's it's always going to be something
epiphenomenal it's always going to be something that is kind of irrelevant like what i took and this is my
sort of like how i got ruptured from the natural sciences to speculative philosophy was that i took the
interiority of the subject and the interiority of my subjectivity as something that broke my image
of natural science and i and i had to do that i had to do that to myself it was a self-violence that
i did to myself like i was sitting i was in doing my doctorate i was taking doctoral level courses on
neuroscience and cognitive science and evolutionary science because my doctoral supervisor was a
expert in those fields but i was like this doesn't have any relationship to the dreams i had last
night or this doesn't have any relationship to the desire i'm feeling when i see that girl at the school
yesterday right or you know it doesn't touch me it doesn't it doesn't move me it's not whatever it is
it's it's i'm epiphenomenal to it so i had to i have to break that relationship and so like you know
in regards to like someone like sean carroll for example it's interesting you brought up him because
one of his quotes always sticks in my mind which is something like he said and it might even be in
from an interview about this book the big picture he said we know a lot about physics we know a little
bit about chemistry and biology and we know almost nothing about politics and society and i think
that he needs to take his own knowledge more seriously and break himself with that because
if you actually break yourself with that very statement where it will bring you is actually look
if you really want to think the core of politics and society you've got to start with figures like
hegel and marx you've got to start with figures like freud and lacan there's no way around it because
you know if you want to understand modern politics if you want to understand modern society it you know
it's it's yeah i mean it's not going to be found in general relativity it's not going to be found in
quantum mechanics it's not going to be found in evolutionary biology it's not going to be found in
neuroscience right it's going to be found in my point of view continental philosophy
so it it it really changes the game and and you know on the one hand continental philosophy is
difficult and obscure and many people have a resistance to really exposing themselves to the
arduous labor that's involved in learning continental philosophy because it's just as
difficult as learning quantum physics or evolutionary biology in order to understand those fields you have
to study them for five ten years you have to dedicate your being to those fields
and the same goes for continental philosophy you have to dedicate your being to those fields and it
changes your being right so in some ways you know yeah there's a there's a high bar there's a high
bar but i think increasingly this bar needs to be we need to raise ourselves to this bar because this
this knowledge is is indispensable yeah i mean i i don't want to this uh cadel uh that idea of how it
changes your being so it's interesting uh sean kelly the heideggerian uh phenomenologist philosopher he
he was once uh i think on lex friedman's podcast and the tip the age-old now kind of like uh almost
boring question uh came up you know our machines going to be conscious are we going to have agi all these
notions right i mean it's been discussed ad nauseum really i think and then he said well i don't know
if machines are going to be conscious but we can say for sure that by humans interacting with machines
humans are going to become more like machines uh as in it's not that we i mean but this is really
important when when we subjectively engage with something it changes us and the big mistake i see a
lot made a lot in analytic philosophy and this kind of like more like science oriented thinking is they
they can't think the subject as to how you're always part of the equation i mean hegel i think
this is really well aware the subjects always whatever you're observing you're already in it
you can't i mean i mean even character guy talks about this i think um however kind of that being said
now i'm probably gonna i'm probably gonna hystericize this conversation a little bit and
kind of be the hysterical student so everything you said i at a very almost visceral much essential
level i agree but this is something i've been i've been uh working through and struggling with trying
to think through because there's something in me where i i am very averse to bullshit the reason i'm
averse to bullshit is because i myself sometimes fall fall into bullshit but also i just i feel
like i i just put out bullshit you know like the notion is like and i mean bullshit in the technical term
uh so it's it's not true so it's it's kind of why for me when it comes to especially uh science
i'm like okay how can i keep a away from science and philosophy um and one one way i've been thinking
about this is like the the simple way of segregation and categories is that so michael strevens this this
philosopher of science i spoke to a few months a few years ago actually he wrote this book called a
knowledge machine and his whole thing is so everything you describe everything here's where i'm
going to historicize the conversation everything you articulated it's true about science science will
never account for subjectivity uh in fact uh galileo uh galileo one of the the the the godfathers of
science he said that science shouldn't account even for quality it should just be about quantity
um and and he's saying that's what science should be science which should simply study systems uh you know
empirically it's it's formalism and empirically it should not think about these questions of uh
yeah the interior life or design all these questions brought up by carnal philosophy that should be left
to let's let's call it a certain type of philosophy or maybe more that broader the humanities so to an
argument like that pertaining to science and since we are after all this book is about the foundations of
science how would you how would you respond to an argument like that that no science should because
if the moment you bring in the subject a lot of get can get in the way and again kissing point would
be someone like uh jordan peterson who kind of brings in like a lot of the his kind of conservative
politics into uh into science and then brings in like union archetypes and and and you know kind of
almost like a to a level of like a like a pervert would do in the psychoanalytic language uh in any
case uh yeah how would you respond to an argument like that great so you mentioned jordan peterson and
you know there was just that huge conversation between richard dawkins and jordan peterson where you
get this sort of juxtaposition between like the archetype of a rational scientist right like if like
there is a if there is an archetype for a rational scientist it's it's richard dawkins like i mean
you couldn't get and like he plays the part so almost comically well yeah he's he's comically the
part you know and and non-ironically inside of his own subjectivity he's he's he's playing that part you
know and and what i mean by that is like you know if if i'm speaking to you know the the bs detector
for science i mean it's you know richard dawkins is is probably insanely uncomfortable engaging
dialogue with jordan peterson because he's constantly trying to detect bs right like and and
like what like and now you could imagine like inside inside richard dawkins head is like how much is
this that jordan peterson saying is complete bs or is there anything here that i can pull out as
like a rational kernel that i could possibly engage in like you could imagine that's how his
his mind's working but you know one of the interesting dimensions of that conversation
relate to the question that you're asking me here which is basically jordan peterson was saying
aren't you open to the possibility that a non-scientific dimension underpins science the
scientific enterprise itself and he and he and richard dawkins conceded yeah that's that's that's
totally possible or jordan peterson also said um don't you think it don't you think it's possible
that christianity uh functioned as some sort of historical precondition for the emergence of the
scientific enterprise itself and dawkins also sort of mildly agreed and basically said something like
um even if that's true i'm only vaguely interested in it or it's only vaguely interesting and something
like that doesn't necessarily mean that i'm any more likely to trust the truth propositions of
christianity even if that's true right so so but the the point he's conceding there is that the
scientific enterprise as a historical phenomenon has a non-scientific underpinning some perhaps you
could say a metaphysical underpinning and that all metaphysical systems are not the same there's
differences between different metaphysical systems and certainly the western metaphysical
system was christianity and that christianity in some sense could have played some historical
role setting up the preconditions for a society in which the scientific enterprise was possible
now in regards to i'm just sort of setting the scene there for for what i really want to say
which is that this question of quantity that emerges in galileo okay because galileo is really the birth of
modern science in in many ways and his emphasis on quantity his emphasis on mathematization occurs at
a certain historical moment it doesn't just pop out of nowhere right it's a certain historical moment
that galileo emphasizes quantity and emphasizes the importance of mathematizing nature
as opposed to in the context of the disagreement between peterson and dawkins mythologizing nature right
i mean in many ways this this distinction between facts and myths can be located right at this
wedge of modern science with galileo and the quantification and the mathematization of the universe right
now here's what hegel does and what hegel does is he does a science of logic
right so galileo's doing a science of nature galileo's doing a science of physics
and hegel's doing a science of logic more than two centuries after galileo again the historical dimension here's
not the historical dimension here's important because we're talking about setting the preconditions
for something to arise
so what happens is when we focus exclusively on quantity
a certain quantity builds up you can add well quantity you start quantifying things and you can get a
cumulative effect
by this and this is what the scientific rational mind loves that you can you have a certain arrow
you have a certain direction you have right you want to defend against bs because you don't want to be
bothered by all the noise of the universe
right all the noise that could distract you from all like you want to focus on something
where you could reliably where you could reliably build something
right and in evolutionary anthropology not to get too far from the point but in evolutionary
anthropology this is called the ratcheting effect and the ratcheting effect is what's responsible for
cumulative culture culture that can be reliably passed on from one generation to the next
this was actually the idea that first lit my mind on fire when i was young and i started a blog called
the ratchet which was this which is this ratcheting of cumulative culture that explodes in human beings
and which you can't really find too easily in chimpanzees although you find it in you find it
in a very primitive form but it explodes in the human being right and there's this intergenerational
transfer from father to son to bring in this i would say christian atheist dimension to the main point
to the main point this quantitative increase which gets really formalized beautifully in modern science
leads to something qualitatively different in other words you build up a quantity
and a new quality appears right naturally so the thing is is and now in contemporary science this is
where you get an interesting split you get the split between reductionism and emergentism right and
reductionists they don't think this new qualitative emergence is relevant to the fundamental truth
reductionists don't believe this emergence this qualitative transformation that opens up with the increasing quantity
is related to the fundamental truth emergentists think that it's just as real or more real
than the say the fundamental base level of reality in other words the fundamental base level of reality
reality versus the qualitative emergence that opens up in history for the emergentists they're just as equally
interested in the qualitative emergence that opens up in history and that now this is where science
necessarily becomes historicized because science isn't just science like the scientists can present themselves
historically as a neutral dispassionate objective observer but the consequences of scientific work change
history universally which is actually the way like scientists the work that they do and the quantitative
methods that and the quantitative processes that they unleash on human history lead to artificial intelligence
genetic engineering um nanotechnology robot and so forth like and that has universal consequences for
everyone doesn't matter so that's actually when you follow this line of reasoning
i think that's actually like the the most logical way out of post-modernism because the most logical way out of
post-modernism is to recognize science is not true because it's like science is not true because it's
objectively describing reality out there science is more true than other discourses because of the
universal effects historically like science produces again artificial intelligence genetic engineering
nanotechnology which changed the conditions of of social life historically for everyone no matter what the culture is
china africa europe america's whatever and none of the pre-scientific mythological narratives do that
in that sense they're all equally irrelevant on the terms of science in the way that i'm articulating science
but even richard dawkins is not thinking about science in this way like when he was thinking about like
when jordan when he was saying like when dawkins was saying what truths are important to him
he said the age of the universe the age of the earth the history of life and then as like a passing
reference he said like sending rockets to mars but like it's actually the fact that science could for example help us
colonize mars is actually a universal transformative effect social historically like that's actually what's
revolutionary about science and yeah it's underpinned by human mythological systems because humans are going
to have to endure these transformations like like we we endure these transformations so i'm just trying
to say that if you take seriously the history of science and and to me what i'm saying now to me is
more like in some sense it's taking science more seriously than science science than like a state reductionist
scientist because i'm saying like we have to think about how this is transforming the whole planet
if you take seriously the history of science and you historicize science and you pay attention to the
way that science through this quantitative buildup leads to a qualitative transformation which you can't
predict in advance necessarily it's unpredictable that's another interesting thing because internal to
reductionist science they put so much emphasis on predictability they put so much faith they put so
much faith in predictability that they undermine their own ability to understand the history of science
and the way that it leads to unpredictable outcomes and so what i'm saying here is that when you
understand this on the level of what i would say is hegel's science of logic
when you understand that way you realize that science dialectically in some way undermines itself and
needs to be hystericized into its under itself like in some sense like because i started in the natural
sciences and through just naturally following the natural sciences i had to hystericize myself
right internal to science and i think i think then that's my that's my this is my challenge for
scientists is that yeah follow science like but don't don't be so scared that when you really follow
science to its limits that you have to self-hystericize yourself this is this is anyway that i'm not sure
yeah you can take that wherever you want of course of course uh there's a lot i mean i think i was
gonna leave this question for later but i but now we may be here so i might as well ask it in the so
the notion of hystericizing yourself and the notion of this how science does this almost like violence to
our to our historical condition what we are right now um on the uh theory underground um i think the epic
marathon live stream um when when you guys were discussing uh nick clan and accelerationism you
asked the question and and unfortunately i think just because of the the time you couldn't really go
much deeply into this you asked the question will anything human make it to the future uh and i've been
thinking about that probably the past two or three years this has really been the question i've been
tackling with even though i wouldn't even call myself someone who's worked through uh
accelerationist in the way for instance michael downs has uh i'm kind of like just i i so like
zizek said i think it's they're a bit too optimistic they're a bit too the accelerationists um so i'm
curious cadel uh again a very open-ended question so please take this where you want to take it
uh along this line of just discussing what where where how science emerges the the violence it's doing
to a historical condition but even the kind of retroactive violence that just even to the past
in that sense like give it new meaning in the past yeah will anything human make it to the future
okay so in order to really frame this in a quote-unquote like as objective as ways we can get to it
i think we have to posit a counterfactual and this counterfactual is something that i'm increasingly
using because i just think it's a fun thought experiment but imagine the human being existing
eternally i don't mean i don't mean you or i but the human species as we've known the human species say
evolutionary anthropology will suggest that the human species modern humans have existed for about
200 000 years or so now again imagine the human species existing not even for an eternity which is
absurd but say i'll be i'll be modest on a cosmic evolutionary time scale let's say the human species
as we exist now exist for another 10 million years i'm positing this as a thought experiment which i
find incredibly generative which is when you think about the human species and you think about 10 million
years and i'm talking about the human species as we exist as a planetary technological species today
and you think about us existing for 10 million years i don't know about you or what comes to your mind
but for me that short circuits everything because it seems like the human species in 10 million years
doesn't doesn't doesn't doesn't make sense when i think about mars when i think about the andromeda galaxy
when i think about almost all physical phenomena and i think about 10 million years yeah of course mars
will exist in 10 million years of course the andromeda galaxy will exist in 10 million years
yeah of course the earth will exist in 10 million years but the human species as we currently exist
10 million years seems strange because if you think about for example ancient egypt
or if you take ancient china i mean these are things that existed for on human time scales a very long time
i mean three thousand four thousand five thousand years i mean that's a long time for a human
socio-political process to exist
when we think about biological organisms and let's say a span of 10 million year
depends on the organism but a lot of organisms more or less retain their form
uh perhaps not over 10 million perhaps not most over 10 million year
but again with if we think about what the descendants of chimpanzees dolphins
lions lions whatever is 10 million years from now
probably won't be exactly a chimpanzee a lion or a dolphin but it'll be something
within that form range you know it will have gone under changing there are some organisms like the
coelacanth which have mostly remained unchanged for hundreds of millions of years but that's a rare exception
question usually there's more and it's environmentally determined i'm i'm basically just throwing out
this thought experiment to say whatever the human species is whatever the human organism is it's always
given the appearance to me of something that's a process of transformation that is much more that
that is much more a bridge to something else than it is internally consistent within its own identity
eternally now religions historically and tradition and let's say pre-modern human subjectivity
tend towards a view of the human that kind of eternalizes the human form
and thinks about it in an eternal way
however i i don't think that that really survives or holds up to the evolutionary universe
and i mean as soon as the evolutionary universe sort of emerges within science you get like philosophers
like nietzsche saying we're a bridge to the overmen and what do you what have you done to overcome the
human condition like what have you done to overcome the human being right i'm not saying nietzsche is
right there i'm just saying that this sort of philosophical thought emerges here at this site
and i'm not saying that i know what the future of the human species is a lot of what i'm trying to do in
my doctoral thesis global brain singularity is kind of revolutionize the concept of evolution
evolution through taking seriously what i call techno cultural evolution as an independent evolutionary
process obviously connected to biocultural evolution obviously connected to biochemical evolution but a
qualitative emergence of evolution which could lead to something else and obviously that's where my thought
and nick land's thought in some ways collide even if i would take a different approach to nick land
it's he's trying nick land himself is a philosophical symptom of this problem
and and and i i think more more and more philosophical attention needs to be brought to it in
for in fact my interest in philosophy comes from confronting this problem because again i was
internal to the natural sciences i was an evolutionary scientist i was doing my background research in my
doctoral thesis on on trying to revolutionize the concept of human evolution and internal to that struggle
i recognized the need for philosophy and so that's kind of you know i mean i could talk more and more
about that but i'm just saying that more just setting the stage for like how my mind processes that
tension and and how to think that tension you know um ultimately the canary in the coal mine for this issue
is the question of reproduction and and that's an evolutionary canary in the coal mine and what i mean
by canary in the coal mine for is just a metaphor for if you're looking for the seeds or the sign that
there might be something not quite right internal to the human species you have to look to reproduction
evolutionarily speaking because reproduction is the whole name of the game differential survival
differential reproduction natural selection sexual selection and the weird thing about the human
species and modernity or the weird thing about the human species and our modern technological environment
is that we as opposed to biological organisms tend to reduce our reproduction when we come into
abundance abundance abundance whereas as soon as we come into abundance reproduction goes down there's
many factors a lot of it has to do with education a lot of it has to do with more self-reflection on
our own being the more has to be that a lot of the things that were mediated by religious givens
become our own existential choice which is like a evolutionary pressure for more philosophy it's almost like
there's an evolutionary pressure for philosophy because all of the things that used to be handled
by religious cultural givens are now the domain of an existential choice that you have to make
and which is actually kind of dizzyingly disorientingly vertiginous like uh catherine everett will say in
in uh her book on on vertigo what do you go yeah but hey um i almost called you hegel yeah but cadel isn't
this where it's isn't this where ferudians live hey isn't isn't this where uh i think
beautifully this connects back to subjectivity because you see what you all everything you describe
right now this notion of uh thinking evolutionarily in a biological system if you think evolutionarily
yes it's reproduction that's fundamentally the question even if you come to the level of the selfish gene
meme theory however however and here's where i i think if we bring in the psychoanalytic toolkit
it's not about reproduction it's about enjoyment and i i think that's where so it's this contradiction
that i'm trying to work through this this notion of you could you could make the evolutionary argument
for every other phenomena you see in any kind of system really i mean well at least any kind of living
organic system but when we when we speak of humans we can't speak in those terms we need to speak in
terms of enjoyment so and and that's where i i guess once again the the the subject that's you know
that's we need we start thinking about the subject so so uh yeah this is where i'm i'm gonna yeah please
go ahead yeah absolutely so like that so this is the so the zero level tension here you're absolutely
absolutely right so the zero level tension here and how this appears and this is also the point
of systems and subject is deprived is try to present these meta level tensions that appear internal to the
historicity of science and so that like this is a big focus of part two of the book which is
basically historically speaking internal to the scientific universe
you have a tension between darwin on the one hand which is of course focusing on reproduction
and freud on the other hand which is focusing on enjoyment and both of them are accepting the
presuppositions of the evolutionary universe but they're putting a different focus on it one's putting
the focus on reproduction one's putting the focus on enjoyment or one's putting the focus on you
could even say repetition of enjoyment as opposed to the reproduction of the organism
and what's interesting to think historically and this is what i do in the book in part two
is i think about the way in which freud's distinction of enjoyment repetition of enjoyment
and this is in the death drive is the uh repetition compulsion
that this actually disrupts science so deeply that it others psychoanalysis
right and it says psychoanalysis is other to science
right and freud spends his whole life trying to make psychoanalysis a science
right and is always sort of again self just like science self distances themselves from freud and
psychoanalysis and again otherizes it's like because of this issue because of this tension because it's
an issue of the unconscious subject which the ego finds in incredibly disturbing and inherently disorienting
because it is what i try to do in systems and subjects is say in some sense counter to freud's
project instead of trying to get science to accept psychoanalysis why don't we just raise uh psychoanalysis to
a meta science and this to me and and because what because what freud's doing trying to get science to accept
psychoanalysis is in some sense treating science like a big other like accept my knowledge accept accept
accept what we're we're doing here accept that it's valid right and of course it doesn't work it
doesn't work science doesn't accept it in mainstream science doesn't accept it so the solution here is just
stop treating let's say mainstream science reduction of science as the big other
it's it's it's it's it's not valid and like for example in the conversation between richard dawkins and
jordan peterson jordan peterson was constantly treating richard dawkins like a big other big other
yes like he was he was constantly trying to get richard dawkins memetic theory to recognize the importance of
archetypes and what the thing is is like as like as soon as you relate to the other
as if on their to on their symbolic terms so to speak like memes is real and archetypes are not real
right as soon as you accept that sort of unconscious precondition for the conversation
you've lost like already you've lost already the conversation is going to go in that direction
so in some sense what i'm trying to do in systems and subjects in part two
is basically say no freud you don't need to treat science like a big other we can just
basically treat this as its own project which is internal to the scientific universe
but not reducible to the scientific universe it's actually and this is what lacan does and like what
what lacan does is say that psychoanalysis is not reducible to science but is only possible within a
scientific universe in other words science was a precondition for psychoanalysis to emerge
in the same way that perhaps christianity was a precondition for science to emerge
science was a precondition for psychoanalysis to emerge and then you could ask yourself then you could
ask yourself another further question is what does psychoanalysis establish as its own historical
condition of possibility for something else to emerge right and i think that's actually where we
are where we are right now is at the limit of psychoanalysis and we have a question of what does
psychoanalysis make possible which was not possible before psychoanalysis and that's the type of question
that i'm trying to get into in systems and subjects well yes i mean i would say this is again as you can so
this this the possibility opening up the possibility is that this is where
judge took psychoanalysis from the clinic brought it to philosophy critical theory uh brought it to even
even in some sense uh sociology in a certain way and and yeah i mean would you say uh
sort of these things like uh well i mean that probably is a bit unfair i was gonna say uh
you know the notion of like accelerationism uh all these there's ongoing dialogues regarding like you
know will a human making to the future uh whether whether that's opened up by what psychoanalysis said but
i would still say it's more of what well it would really be capitalism and and science that opened up
uh the next possibility which is accelerationism um yeah excellent cadel uh that was there was a lot
there so one thing i want to ask i think what psycho just very i think what psychoanalysis does
is within the context of capitalism and science psychoanalysis gives us another reflective tool for
thinking about the modes of enjoyment that open up within that horizon right like psychoanalysis is not
necessarily interested in let's say like the internet as such or technological gadgets as such but
the modes of enjoyment that human subjects can experience because of the horizon that now exists
right and i think that for example you know someone like isabel millar is asking those questions with
her book about psycho you know basically psychoanalysis of artificial intelligence yeah but which is
centering on this question of of juicence of enjoyment internal to the universe of sex bots and and
artificial intelligence and so forth yeah as in like it's not about if you know ai can think or ai can
reason is is does ai enjoy and that that's that's the question right yeah i see it's like a toolkit to
to describe this phenomenal or speak what's phenomena okay uh could i i want to touch on a bit more
on your uh phd dissertation you know global brain singularity but also i couldn't read this book
because i like the time energy the recent publication by philosophy portal so this notion of the global
brain logic for the global brain i'll ask the question this way um let's let's speak ontology
for a moment and the reason i'm bringing ontology here is look i i don't think this notion of we've really
moved to a place now where we've kind of moved away from kind of the almost like the 20th century vienna
circle atomistic kind of thinking you know with people like whitehead uh with the process philosophy
uh kind of even even with someone like color valley that fundamentally says it's what's what's
fundamental is events it's not objects uh and then now i mean what's really in vogue is this new form of
globalism panpsychism so or mind at large so we've really this question now is currently it's on in
the in the it's in the spotlight people people are talking about this notion of yeah of like
of systems of the whole and so yeah to use a hegelian language well my question to you would be
firstly can you like outline what do you mean by a global brain and how it pertains to even your work
with the systems theory but then also maybe as a follow-up if you could work on from that
as an hegelian what do you think uh hegelian philosophy in particular has to to to uniquely
speak to these questions pertaining to idealism or even like panpsychism or even these questions of
where yes like the notion that you know like is consciousness fundamental what do you think hegelian
philosophy will will tell us uniquely uh do this kind of thinking i mean i know that was a lot there
but um if you could work off that sure well i mean i think in terms of the concept of the global brain
that was basically how i came into my doctoral project because my doctoral supervisor is i would say
the pioneer of the concept of the global brain and the reason why and his name is francis heiligen
and if you look him up he's a whatever world-renowned evolutionary scientist and i recommend his papers
google scholar francis heiligen and you'll find a lot of good stuff so the reason why i was attracted to
the notion of the global brain was because it offered let's say a more systematic anthropologically
robust way to think about technological singularity usually in technological singularity theory there's
just this hyper focus on artificial intelligence and its own capacity to recursively bootstrap itself
beyond itself or beyond the human condition whereas the concept of the global brain is thinking about
the whole system of technology so it's it's kind of it's it's a kind of anti-reductionist version
of the technological singularity that's how i think about it i think about the technological
singularity theory as kind of like a reductionist version of the global brain theory
and that's how i discuss it in the thesis and the reason why the technological singularity theory is a
little more reductionist is again because it it hyper isolates artificial intelligence from the whole
human system and the network of computers and the network of technologies of which it's dependent as
well right and it's kind of like the ecology in which it emerges and interconnects everything
right so the global brain i took to be like a more anthropologically historically systemically more
robust concept and i thought i saw that also as a concept that was worth uh or that could contain my
my desire to develop this new theory of human evolution which was capable of thinking not only
biochemical evolution but biocultural evolution and techno-cultural evolution as one process
yeah so the reason why the latest philosophy portal anthology is called logic for the global brain
yeah is because basically internal to my own explorations in my doctoral thesis about the
global brain and the evolutionary process i recognized the need for both uh the science of logic as well as
a more strong concept of the unconscious because i think what was missing from the global brain concept
was basically the type of philosophy that zizek's developing and the deeper i looked into what was
zizek's influence obviously it's the main influences are hegel and lecon so i went into those resources and
long story short like you know the logic for the global brain on the on the hegelian side is
basically in here like here even following like a mainline hegelian philosopher like stephen hulgate
who says we have not even become hegelians yet that all of post hegelian philosophy
is kind of like that it's kind of like an anxiety about hegel like and here i want to like talk about
like how philosophy operates differently than most other fields like because progress is so slow even
if you could say there's progress like i'm not even sure the word progress makes sense it's more that
it's more that there's fundamental ruptures that occur within different historical epochs
so i would say like for example you get a thinker like plato or you get a thinker like hegel
like in a certain epoch they're like epoch divining defining philosophers and then either you get like
people who follow them in a form of imitation or you get people who just use them as a point of negation
right and of course like plato and hegel are both characteristic of being just people's points
of negation like anything but hegel yeah totally anything anything yeah anything but plato right
anything but you know and you in the same way as like whitehead says about plato that all of philosophy
is a footnote on plato you could say that all of modern philosophy is a footnote on hegel
okay like i would want to like i would i would want to say like
all pre-modern philosophy is a footnote to plato and all of modern philosophy is a footnote to hegel
and this is this is and this this is basically what am i what am i saying here so like very like very
i think concretely because like notions like becoming notions like process are very popular now
basically the elemental seed of hegel's logic is that becoming is superficial
or process is superficial unless you understand becoming as the vanishing of being and nothing
becoming is the vanishing of being and nothing into each other and this has not been thought
seriously like and now he's thinking about this logically of course he's also thinking about how
it relates to spirit and nature but i think that to me the logic of being and nothing vanishing into
each other is absolutely revolutionary when it comes to thinking about the unity of life and death
when it comes to thinking about the unity of pleasure and pain when it comes to thinking about the unity of
vitality and concept when it comes to thinking the unity of subject and object this
this this vanishing into each other of being and nothing is the truest is it is a truer form of
becoming and if you don't understand that that's how becoming that that's what becoming is that you too
easily fall into like a silly one-sidedness so like you fall into like a life that can't think death
or you could fall into a death like a nihilism that can't think life or you fall into like a life or you
fall into a vitality that can't think concept or you fall into a conceptualization that's disconnected
from life or you fall into an object that's disconnected from subject or you fall into a
subject that's disconnected from object or you know basically what the title systems and subjects is
inspired by is the axiom that hegel develops in the phenomenology that says everything the true
hangs on that the true is both substance and subject yeah but i'm just playing with that and saying
systems and subjects and basically saying that instead of substance which hegel's deriving from spinoza
that i use system which is just i think a more modern way of thinking substance
because even if you think of most process philosophers and interdisciplinary scientists today
they more think system than substance and the re and we could go into why that is but i'm just
saying here i'm basically that that's like the reason why i'm making that concession is because
i'm not really responding to spinoza in the way that hegel's obviously responding to spinoza
i'm trying to get a conversation between system science and continental philosophy so that's sort
of like so i'm basically saying here like this the fact that becoming is the vanishing being and nothing
is the seed which hegel calls the seed of the philosophical sciences which is not a philosophy of science
science and is not a scientific philosophy it's a philosophical science or the science of the concept
or the science of the idea to connect plato and hegel right so it's not a philosophy of science like
thomas kuhn or karl popper and it's not a scientific philosophy like karl marx
yeah yeah yeah i mean this this notion of uh cis sorry not system subject as substance i'm in fact
i was just reading um rereading uh jack's uh sublime object just for some writing i was doing and i've
got the quote right here so for instance jack says that uh hegel asserts a previously unheard of division
that runs through the subject as well as through the uh substantial order collectivity uniting the two
that is to say what if the reconciliation between the particular and universal occurs precisely
through the division that cuts across the through uh cuts across the two so that latter bit the division
i mean i i don't know how to even ask this question uh karel but
okay what i find that's lacking in the conversations both in like the process philosophy
or or even like these notions of kind of like the modern idealism you see with people like bernardo
kastrup is this they don't account for the antagonist it's an unreflective one like that's it it's like a monad
yes it's it's a way like i can't stress this enough when you include the subject into the truth
you're asking for a lifelong negativity and like that's much easier to have an unreflective one
like it's it's i can't stress like it you're gonna your life your your your life thinking process
is going to be constantly disrupted
because you and your vicissitudes are part of the truth correct
and and there's some you've got to think that so but it's also great because your thought can stay
alive like your thought is constantly refreshed by the vicissitudes of your day-to-day life
but like and also you have to like to think here's the thing to think here's the challenge i think to
think the one and history is the ultimate philosophical challenge like people always just
want to think history without the one or they want to think the one without history
because both are are way easier right like to think the one as history is incredibly difficult
like it's it's it's and to put it like and now i'm i'm obviously speaking what i just was saying there
was speaking in philosophical terms but if i was just to speak in common everyday terms
it's like the challenge of a long-term marriage like to think like for example like just like to
bring a concrete concept like to think a long this and this is like this is what motivates me like
to think a long-term marriage is to think the one as history
right very concretely like what else is it you're thinking about the one as history
and we'll think about a marriage it's two elements which are opposite and which will never actually be
one
one and which will always have a gap
and which will always kind of misunderstand each other and which will always kind of be missing each
other constitutively and which will always kind of be a bit of a surprise to each other
and is always kind of like the challenge of thinking what can't be thought
and that's what you have to and that's the challenge
right so i'm i'm now i'm using that as like even like the best example i think of
yeah but the state yeah but also here's where i mean in my in my rereading of course it's funny
initially when i got into chicken philosophy i thought it was deeply pessimistic it is it is but
that's it's it it doesn't end there the thing is this the the antagonisms this like misunderstanding
the or to use uh more more kenyan uh jargon this not working the the the that it doesn't fit this
is a productive not working it's uh it's it's not a reconciliation but this division this cut
is it's a product it's it's what keeps thinking going i'm i think we need to have a more
concerted effort to uh resist and and counteract this false idea that zizek is pessimistic in in of
course zizek will say things like i hate life um in like joking way yeah but no i i think that
it i think it's actually the the way the way zizek's thinking is the only way to be really optimistic
like there's like like what i mean or you could say an optimism of the real
like it because you don't want to have an optimism that like to me like to me i would much rather be
like i would much rather be pessimistic than to be optimistic in a childish or a superficial or
like a way that's just a a wish fulfillment or like just a detached optimism like or an optimism
that they like like like the type of optimism that just blatantly ignores the actual tensions
and antagonisms of the situation like i have no for me personally my temperament i have no time for this
type of optimism i only am interested in the like and here's what i here's my here's my experience of
living this like like because i'm not just thinking this philosophy like i live this i like i live out
this way been living this philosophy for approaching a decade i think that what you get is and what you
learn is there is a type of abyssal confrontation here like they're like there isn't like there is
an abyssal dimension to this way of living but if you're willing to think the antagonisms of the moment
in their abyssal nature retroactively you can see that actually there was a forward advance
like i i've i've experienced that i've experienced that in my relationships i've experienced that in
my business or i've experienced that in my creative drive that if i'm willing to think the imminent
antagonism of the situation that actually a higher level almost like anti-fragility or meta-stability
uh is is a retroactive result of of the of the tarrying with the negative
hmm like the tarrying with the net like the tarrying with the negative
does lead the thing is the reason why it's difficult is because in the moment of the
tarrying with the negative it it literally feels like everything is going to fall apart
yeah yeah it feels that way and the thing is is that because you're in the thing like you're so
like back to the beginning of systems and subjects you're in the system
you can't like abstract like from an external third person point of view
you know like you can't imagine like you can't be like the disinterested neutral objective scientist
that's not in part of the system and just like as it were like think about like what evolutionary
scientists observe like i always was fascinated when i was in originally i was in primatology
and i was reading these field notes i actually went to africa for two summers to study chimpanzees
but i was reading these primatological field notes of like which are always get left out of the
scientific papers of like what they saw like they would see like for example like a infant they would
see an infanticide right like they would see infanticide they would see rape they would see war
when watching the chimpanzees but they would just be collecting data as external like and you would get
like these scientific reports about like rates of infanticide in this chimpanzee group or rates of
you know murder in this chimpanzee group or something like a very cold analysis but i'm saying that
evolutionary biologists and anthropologists they're super aware of the brutality of nature
but they can but they're always studying it from an external point of view
like it's not like they aren't getting raped like their kid isn't like their kid isn't being killed
right they're studying it from an external point of view but the challenge here and this is like the
deep challenge i think of hegelian science is what is hegelian science it's that
the interesting thing about science is that it changes from pre-modern philosophy
where pre-modern philosophy is just contemplating substance
and and modern science is testing substance
it's testing it it's experimenting with it but where the limits of modern science are the difference
between modern science and hegelian science is that you don't have to you you can't only test
substance you have to test substance and subject it's not only substance it's also subject so you're
in the system you are under the test your subjectivity is the test so the thing is is that this um
um dealing with the imminent antagonisms of life is the is the test and your capacity to be scientific
is your capacity to do the conceptual labor of the negative like your conceptual
tarrying with the negative is the test that's that's that's as close i can think no i mean i
couldn't agree more i just want to have this point here i mean i want to be mindful of the time because
i've got two really important questions but it's really interesting you know i've spoken a lot of
hegelian thinkers and for some reason a lot of them either haven't worked on i don't mean like the
scholars i mean just like generally people like me who are neophytes interested in hegel they haven't
really worked that much through uh through character god um and i would say zizek makes this point in
in his interviews but also in his writing that character god is most hegelian when he thinks he's
against hegel because character god if you read character god he always makes this point that you
are in the equation you're in this you're in the system in in that sense and and this is ultimately
for me even hegel's point i mean initially i remember because i i read character god before hegel
and i always thought of hegel as is almost like what you describe the caricature version of hegel you know
system big system and then you know you're just like building this abstract philosophical system
but credit cards whole point was that no you're in the system you're caught up in it
and that's why zizek says that character god is most hegelian when you are when he thinks he is
being more and most anti-hegelian up so i mean i couldn't agree more i just had to make that point but
yeah sorry were you gonna were you gonna comment on that i just wanted to say that my contribution my
main contribution to logic for the global brain is a a paper called concept to being where i what i
try to do and i tried to do this in the course like it's almost absurd what i try to do in the course but
like in the paper what i'm trying to do is actually apply the hegel's logic of the concept and and
demonstrating that it actually allows you to map the way i've built philosophy portal so i'm trying
to say hegel's system hegel system is not a big system external to me as a subject hegel's system
is system and subject which if you actually read the science of logic deeply and you you can model
your own subjective process your own subjective process can be modeled using hegel's logic it's system
and subject and in in the class i was even able to model myself to the point where i could identify
where in the logic my current position of subjectivity was located and the contradiction that i was in
like that's the remarkable thing about hegel's logic is like he's he like with spinoza you're just
getting a a system of substance but in hegel you're getting a system of substance and subject and that means
that like your subjective process is it's following an unconscious conceptual logic
and if you actually follow that through it's not an enslaving thing it actually brings you to a
different level of being it's not anti-life it's not anti-being what it does is even in more interesting
it brings you to a i think it brings you to a level of being in life that you could not have gotten
otherwise so in a way you do release so like for example like say say i say i never started philosophy
portal because i'm just nihilistic the whole thing's a mess the whole academic system's a waste and
there's no point to teach anything or do anything we're just living in a late capitalist uh you know
bullshit society right if i never did that it's sorry if i approach that way no no point to start
because the point is is that philosophy portal will not last forever it's a process that will unfold
under a logic that's even partially unconscious to me of course but if i follow the logic of it to its end
to its dissolution philosophy portal is own end where i'll find myself is a position in being in life
that i wouldn't have been able to get to without the process of philosophy portal
so the point is is that if you unfold a conceptual logic don't identify with the beginning this is what
people this is people can't if this is why people can't build something the reason why people can't
build something is because they identify too much with the and the immediacy of the concept
like i had an intuition of philosophy portal at the beginning of it but that doesn't do anything like
it's a nice image but you have to follow the mediation of it with all the surprises and negativities
and all the practical bullshit of doing it and where you where you end up if you follow it to its logical
conclusion is a is a point of being or life that you couldn't have gotten otherwise and i think all people
who are uh self-revolutionizing entities like for example i like let me throw two uh documentaries out
there where you could watch as these examples of self-revolutionizing entities where i think they're
hegelian subjects in the sense that they get to a place in being or life that they couldn't have
gotten to if they didn't follow their own conceptual logic arnold schwarzenegger and uh vince mcmahon
if you watch the documentaries of arnold schwarzenegger and vince mcmahon they're both crazy people
absolutely mad people and passionate as hell and driven as hell and what they do is so arnold
schwarzenegger's is very easy you could even model arnold schwarzenegger with lakon's imaginary symbolic
and real triad so with arnold schwarzenegger he had the um weightlifting and he followed weightlifting to
its absolute exhaustion and then when he got to the end of it he had done everything possible in weight
lifting he transitioned to acting but he couldn't have gotten to acting without weightlifting
he couldn't have done and then he followed acting to its limit and then he did everything possible in
acting and then he went into politics and he couldn't have gone into politics without with without
without the the acting that he so i'm saying that and he couldn't have predicted in advance like when
he was a weightlifter he couldn't have predicted that he would become in uh in in movies and then when he was
in movies he couldn't have predicted that he would go into the poll go into politics so the point is is
that you get to like if you follow this logic the point is that you exhaust a certain concept
yes when you exhaust when you exhaust a certain concept like everyone it's so easy to identify
with the immediacy of a concept like have the immediacy of the concept as me is like a big a big
weightlifter or have the immediacy of the concept of me as a movie star or a politician but to
actually do it and to exhaust it well that takes drive that takes crazy drive yeah i mean in philosophy
one name i can think of is wittgenstein who who does this uh wittgenstein for sure but also
well from everything you said cadel what i what i really want to stress on and this this has been
for me this has been one huge takeaway from getting philosophy is this the fact that you can't predict
it that it's it's it's purely contingent the drive is there it's an absolute drive but it's a con
but the event itself in some sense is contingent and then necessity comes necessity is always made
from contingency i mean adrian johnson writes of this well in his book the new german idealism
uh um so i mean gosh man i that was that was so good i don't even know where to where to go from
there uh look i was gonna ask you a boring question about negativity and data because i i kind of want
to bring up more of this more more concepts from hanging in philosophy into the world of uh ai but
i'm gonna leave that for another time because i need to do a bit more thinking and a bit more writing
before before i ask you these questions pertaining to you're not going to believe this you're not
believe this but i'm pub i'm published in a journal for ai and society okay with with a professor of
artificial intelligence uh his name's you probably know him his name's thomas hammer of course i've
already emailed him yes yeah machine learning professor yeah yeah so we could we could we could
discuss that paper but we're published together because we we published on artificial intelligence and
bringing in hegel's logic that would be specifically the logic specifically the logic of the and we're
the problem we're trying to approach is called the abstraction explosion that we have an explosion of
abstractions because of in artificial intelligence yeah but hegel's logic here is interesting because
hegel's logic is actually not as you know like thesis antithesis synthesis no hegel's logic hegel's
logic is abstract negative concrete and the big challenge that we're struggling with today is how
to negativize the abstractions towards a new concretion and that's the challenge that's i think
the challenge before us in regards to ai and society is how do we negativize the abstraction explosion
towards actual new concrete reality anyway so i just wanted to throw that out there because it might
might overlap yeah is that paper available uh for the public like i can send it to you yeah
i can i can get i would love to i would like to discuss that uh in you know follow-up conversation
especially with uh professor hammer again yes i uh i should mention here excellent recent conversation
with the renin jarad uh i thoroughly enjoyed it um especially kind of uh how how i feel like that
conversation was more of uh it was an antithesis to the kind of the the tech bro renin jarad we see
uh kind in silicon valley uh all right last question i i have to ask you this because i mean
i found you through zizek i found you through well really zizek's less than nothing um and i
don't know if you want to talk about this publicly uh but we did discuss offline that you're thinking
of doing something on less than nothing at philosophy portal uh i regret not being able to join the the
ca coast because as you know i moved to sydney you know helter-skelter lack of time energy all of that
uh but uh just if you could tell us just for the listener maybe give us a teaser on um yeah zizek's
tone less than nothing why why do you think why do you think this book in particular is is just a
groundbreaking text in philosophy but also uh kind of maybe give us a t give us a few insights as to how
you're planning to teach this book if you are to do a course at philosophy portal uh and and from there
we'll go yeah yeah so i've been that's the book so like on a personal like intimate level
the less than nothing there's there's a few books in my history where like i encounter it and it like
changes my it changes my world and less than nothing was was was definitely that book for me
in regards to philosophy and at least for me if i'm thinking about zizek's legacy for me it's for me
it's less than nothing and and and i i'd like to think that i'm contributing in some way to making less
than nothing that uh putting it on that level because i think before i sort of gave it that
hyper focus i think most people would think about um the sublime object of ideology as his has his
real breakthrough text which of course is like his original breakthrough text but i think less than
nothing i'd like to think of like less than nothing as his the same way we think about when we think
about heidegger we think about being in time or the same way we when we think about hegel we think
about the phenomenology of spirit or something like that and i think less than nothing is on that level
so why why why it's actually i think to me a shame that he called it less than nothing because less than
nothing is actually like it's it's a concept where i'm of the opinion like i've spent enough time with
it and like i feel like i've wrapped my head around it long enough i think it's okay i'm not like
super disappointed he called it less than nothing but i don't think that's the concept that's really
gonna hatch on so to speak i think it's it's it's way too convoluted and complex for most people to
wrap their mind whereas like being in time is like most people can like almost get like an intuitive
inroads to what heidegger's maybe pointing at with being in time like it's not too much of a leap
less than nothing is difficult he actually said in one of his interviews around the time of the
release of that book that he was debating between calling the book less than nothing and ever see
moving and of course the prologue of the book is called ever see moving and yet it moves
which is i think getting at yeah which is galileo and he does a really brilliant little inversion with
galileo in the beginning which i absolutely adore but the the reason why i think that book's important
important and this is obviously massively simplifying is that i think what zizek's doing in less than
nothing is actually theorizing the immortal drive and specifically i think we have a theory of
immortality in that book and so of course i could expand on it would take more time but i just as a
a teaser that's that's that's my cue that's my teaser is that i think what and so historically why is
that important because one of zizek's main claims is that freud and he takes this from lacan that freud did
not understand what he discovered with the death drive and i think that the death drive the death drive is
obviously a concept that even someone like elenka zupanchich sees as like a ongoing construction site
i think if we have a zero level of what zizek's doing with it he's thinking about death drive as
not this uh nirvana principle of no tension release from tension like take for example the difference between
tension and relaxation what death drive is doing is going to higher and higher levels of tension
like through the compulsive repetition you have to contend with higher and higher levels of tension
which cause types of die again die better like you die like but it's not dying as like actual dying it's
dying and and and and and yeah death and rebirth if you like but but like on higher and higher levels
of tension and ultimately he's rebranding death drive i think in less than nothing explicitly
as immortal drive and i think that this rebranding needs to happen and that's what i really want to do
i want to rebrand death drive as a mortal drive because i think that could take off in the culture
and if we get that right this take off in the culture that's also a way for us to get out of this
tendency to say like zizek is a doomer or zizek is a pessimist or like absolute negativity is just uh
a nihilistic concept or something like that so i think a mortal drive could have some currency so
anyway that's that's what i hope to to do with that book eventually well this is one thing i appreciate
even about katherine like yourself it's like it's the the only way to really be optimistic is is
through kind of working through this understanding what the immortal drivers you call it now
uh but oh i i mean i can't wait i mean i know it's it's a lot of work together with coast so
next year uh if you do get to it i'm gonna be propagandizing for it i'm gonna be joseph goebbels
for you and do all the propaganda uh and and i really hope you do get to it uh even though you
know i'm asking for another coast way whereas you're still in the middle of the ca coast so uh
but uh yeah that's where i am at the moment yeah yeah that's where i'm at the moment um yeah yeah so
for anyone for any anyone who's interested philosophy portal dot online you'll find everything
yeah i'll put i'll leave all the links uh but no i mean yeah you you've been you've been one of my
teachers i've been one of your students from from from far for a while and i'm i'm glad that i'm
finally you know breaking that parasocial relationship and just really actually engaging
with you as as a person uh and then in fact i was gonna ask you this which you already answered this
notion of how like being a teacher being someone who's an educator in philosophy and i love that you
said that you always put yourself into the equation so philosophy portal you said that you're always
caught up in it um i think uh yeah yeah i think that i think there's something to think about and
and really contemplate on um what more can i say thank you kadel it's been an honor
thanks so much thanks for the work you're doing appreciate it man
