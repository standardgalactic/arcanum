the stock market all the tech stocks seem to have uh imploded on monday yeah there was a huge huge
drop-off and it was basically because it was revealed the ai that china has been working on
called deep seek was much cheaper way cheaper and its processing power was a lot more impressive
than people had initially anticipated and so when you see dollar for dollar the fact that they have
this model that's also open source it just took a hammer to this industry in this country
that has been really trying to motivate investment into the tech sector on the promise of this
revolutionary technology with ai but china has been able to do it for pennies on the dollar and the
other part of this is hold on one sec i just want to like emphasize this yeah here put this uh headline
up this is this is a headline from four days ago uh right why isn't it there we go there it is this is
from reuters okay uh meta is going to spend up to 65 billion dollars this year to power its ai goals
and this uh deep seek comes out and they supposedly spent six million yes to develop this uh open source
uh program now there's you know some rumors that maybe they have gotten a hold of uh the nvidia chips
that they weren't that were supposed to be um uh illegal for them to have been able to import maybe the
case maybe or they came up with technology that they are manufacturing their chips with a more efficient
material it could be either one although you know there's a certain irony in the idea that their ai may
have um scraped some of our ai uh you know both hardware and software or uh sources to uh develop taking
our ai's jobs but one thing that it clearly reveals is that and you know for a long time we've been
saying a lot of this ai stuff is just is just hype and much of that hype was essentially a way to sort of
like raise supposedly the cost associated with ai and the values associated with ai i mean they're
talking about like you know for months and months and months if you follow like any like you know uh
sometimes i follow some investment people on instagram just to see and they're talking about
we're gonna have to build power plants we're gonna have to build all these major things like it
you know amazon's building all these like power plants and data centers uh for ai and all this
investment and it was just basically more or less sort of like a a ponzi scheme of some sort yeah just
more and more money is following more and more money desperately looking for a place to invest because
you know the meme coin uh they can only put so much money into meme coins and on some level all this ai
stuff was like some of it's real ai is going to be helpful for certain things and whatnot but
there's like a big sort of like space yes in between where what actually needed to be invested
in ai existed and what was that's sort of like on some level a meme coin in and of itself and it's it's
it's just another tech bubble right it's another it is our tech industry which had like buoyed our
economy really from the 90s on there was obviously a uh a crash but since then honestly both parties
have been complicit uh in elevating this industry because it's one of like since the united states has
outsourced manufacturing in the back half of the 20th century this is essentially what the american
economy is built on and it's just such a uh it's a shot across the bow from china but it also is a
very revealing indicator of the charlatans on that side sam altman in this open ai model
um it says open in the name but they do not uh they are not transparent they have basically privatized
their ai model and deep seek is actually open uh deep seek is open source and anybody can download
it on their uh on their iphone and it was one of the most downloaded apps i think over the past few
days because of that very reason it's a superior model because it's actually open and not just there
to inflate the stock value of these tech companies and to get more money for investment and so you
can see how the efficiency model is just such a false premise it's just there to get more money
for these tech oligarchs and this would be i guess just something to laugh at if these oligarchs weren't
a part of the trump administration and if we didn't see things like this which is chuck schumer basically
saying oh we're gonna get on top of this chuck schumer uh tweeted the deep seek announcement from china
has been called by some ai sputnik moment for america it's precisely why i made ai a top priority
in the last congress and we'll keep at it and you know who he's echoing there one mark andresen who
when i was researching this found out has uh uh blocked me which is great uh mark andresen said
on january 26 so two days ago deep seek r1 is ai's sputnik moment what i mean of course andresen wants
you more u.s taxpayer dollars poured into ai and analogizing it to sputnik and to the space race
because that is exactly what all these tech oligarchs want they want more and more billions
of dollars funneled into their project even though they've shown how inefficient they are
and we have the leader of the democrats in the senate more than happy to go along with this event
this this very notion and i want to be clear you know uh sputnik moment refers to when the russians
sent the first satellite into space and everybody in america was like hey wait what what's going on
here you can do that and uh so at that point was it uh truman or eisenhower that gets on uh television
and basically says hey uh guys um we're gonna start up a um we're gonna start up our own
basically uh space program and we're gonna do the um uh we're gonna start nasa at that point and
understand that in that moment the first sputnik moment well who was president 57.
it's 57 eisenhower so yeah and so uh eisenhower is like um we're gonna that's basically the start of
nasa and the reason why i say this is that when chuck schumer and mark andresen say uh this is our
sputnik moment when they say that in 2025 what they're saying is we should give a lot of cash to
private companies as opposed to the actual sputnik moment which was we as a government
are going to meet this moment and develop this technology now of course a lot of that technology
ended up being used by private enterprise uh having essentially socialized the cost of developing
these things and then privatizing the profits on which they built on nevertheless
just be careful when they use sputnik moment and it's almost like a shell game
it's a sputnik moment and what's the whole thing then with giving the money to private enterprise also
we are sputnik i i the the the we were the first to get on the moon in this space race right like
that's considered the the the thing we beat the russians at or the soviets well they beat us into
space but they speed us beat us into space but our ai you know say like it's so advanced like we
in theory we beat them on ai and getting ahead of it or at least that's what we were being told
but they've clearly created a superior product and they're going to get there more quickly because
of the open source model because they are not enclosing it in such a way and uh because everybody's
going to be able to download it so i'm making a prediction right now and i'll expand this to
democrats as well but republicans are going to be saying that this is a national security threat in 48
hours i'm sure that the democrats will follow suit uh deep seek chinese bioweapon leaked from a lab or
something like that in order to pervert the minds of the american public just like that communist tick
tock yep but countdown clock but these are the people running our government right like when we
talk about oligarchy isn't it incredible how little we're mentioning these republican politicians
and we're just talking about these tech freaks because they're running the show yep it's as obvious
as anything and it happened almost overnight hey folks once again trump's personnel picks are all about
loyalty over expertise he named election denier carrie lake to lead the voice of america that's the
u.s funded broadcaster meant to provide unbiased news to global audiences well ground news found
hundreds of articles covering this all concerned about voa's editorial independence but you'll still
find the america first crowd arguing that this appointment will quote restore balance and fairness yeah
in reality we're losing independent journalism and government transparency setting the stage for
propaganda masquerading as credible information that's why i've trusted my partners at ground news
for years to help me critically analyze the news i consume they're the only app that's not telling you
what to think instead they gather all the headlines organize them by story and then add data to each
outlets bias their credibility and their financial incentives so you know exactly who's benefiting from
the spin take it one step further and filter out questionable sources to stay on top of what's
happening without getting buried in the noise trump is shaping our future in ways that's going to last for
decades and if we're not paying attention we're letting history repeat itself so stay engaged with ground news
who's who's fixing what's breaking right in front of us trust and transparency in the media my viewers
