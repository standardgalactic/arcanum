in this episode one of my spiritual uh events was actually a dream where god spoke to me and said i
do not exist um and it's so interesting almost like two different spiritual experiences here
which has obviously led me more to the radical uh and more to the process um because you know
in radical theology there is a an emphasis really on discontinuity and alienation and uh a type of
inexistent god so my kind of formative spiritual experience was not the oneness of everything
and not some sort of organic unity or kind of teleological omega point that we're moving
towards but kind of like a uh primordial negation um on a direct kind of tarring with that primordial
negation hey everyone welcome to this conversation between the philosophers peter rollins and matthew
david seagal um it's just really cool man i mean yes i've had both matt and peter on the podcast before
but uh it just is really cool kind of breaking the parasocial relationship and um talking to them
in person because as i've already told this to them um i've been following their work for years i mean
peter i remember i probably came across him five four or five years ago and at the time i was reading
you know c.s lewis chesterton uh i was even reading like a bit of the medieval philosophers like uh you
know aquinas and augustine and and then also at the same time more in the contemporary scene let's say
people like william lane craig and planting are from uh systematic theology so i was reading all of
these people in theology and philosophy and then suddenly i come across peter's work this notion of
radical theology and it just it was so bizarre to to hear or like listen to the way he speaks of uh
god and religion and how it pertains to kind of our condition and then through him i think i was
introduced to many other thinkers like you know paul tillick and and many more thinkers and just it
really did uproot me uh in a very i'm thinking of the word here i don't want to say good because that's a
bit too tepid or even trite or perhaps the word is in a very necessary way uh in my thinking and then
in my being and i think that's in many ways the goal of uh part of theology and peter's project and
then of course i think matthew people probably know him better as footnotes to plato is really one of
those og online philosophers i mean his lectures on german idealism were the first lectures i watched
when i came across uh hegel and shelling and then of course whitehead um so yeah these two are just
two people i've been following for years and just it still is a bit surreal that i get to
moderate these conversations uh and just yeah how generous they are with their time amidst their
personal projects and writing and thinking and i'm sure they get heaps of these podcast requests from
uh you know online philosophy bros uh in any case it really was great of course again forgive me for
the trite comment that really needs no saying but still uh let's call it as a bit of due diligence um
this even though i did sort of initially propose this conversation as a sort of dialectic not in the
hegelian since i mean literally as the negative or pirate theology of peter and then the process theology of
uh matthew and whitehead it of course is simply putting two views on the table and seeing where
the differences are and where the similarities lie and perhaps there really aren't any similarities but
it probably the truth is in the differences themselves that being said though of course this
wasn't meant to be any kind of debate you'd see from the conversation it was very cordial and congenial
and really uh both matt and peter were trying to understand each other's positions and these
different metaphysical world views and no doubt this conversation was very metaphysically meaty and
in fact matt wrote a reflection on it after the dialogue on a sub stack i'll leave a link to it in
the show notes uh to the piece uh it was brilliant so i hope both of them did really feel there was some
kind of intellectual stimulation uh through exploring these views uh be that as it may now a quick psa
as you may know i've mentioned multiple times i'll never have advertisers or sponsors on this
podcast frankly i think we live in a society of excess and over consumption and i don't want to
contribute to that by selling you more things that being said though forgive me for the tautology

only if you have the means all right back to the episode professor matthew david seagal is a trans
disciplinary researcher writer and philosopher applying process relational port across the natural and social
sciences as well as in the study of consciousness he is the associate professor in the philosophy
cosmology and consciousness program at california institute of integral studies in san francisco and
the chair of the science advisory committee for the cobb institute professor seagal has authored many books
including crossing the threshold etheric imagination in the post kantian process philosophy of
schelling and whitehead and is the creator of footnotes to plato dr peter rollins is a philosopher
and radical theologian working through the tradition of apophatic theology freud lacan hegel and jegec
he has a phd dealing with post-structural theory from queens university belfast and is the author of
numerous books including how not to speak of god and the idolatry of god dr rollins is a creator of
pirate theology which is a live technology that involves a deep critique of any religious or
ideological system that promises an escape from doubt and anxiety on the note i must mention wake
a five-day transgressive festival that peter runs mixing intellectual exploration with underground art
music magic comedy tours and talks to forge an experience that embodies the destabilizing essence
of pirate theology you'll find all the details in the show notes with that being said here's a
conversation with peter rollins and matthew david seagal i mean i don't know i've been following your
work for years in fact peter as you know you're like one of the first people in theology i read and
when i even knew who the hell uh hegel was it was your series matt i watched on youtube like maybe now
six seven years ago uh and so in all those years i've kind of almost like immersed your line of
thinking into my own let's call it thinking or perhaps even subjectivity um and that's where you
know i've sent a few questions and i just want to see like you know throw a few ideas that you both and see
where where this goes really um but i don't know if this is okay matt because i know it's a personal
thing for you but if uh i'm sure peter would appreciate this too you recently said that you
had a bit of a renewed relationship with christ and maybe uh i mean i guess you could call it a testimony
um if you could just really share with us uh what that looks like for you and probably just talk about
it uh i think it would be a lovely place to start this conversation
sure yeah um i don't know how recent it really was i mean it's something that um
happened to me uh as a 19 year old um so uh 20 years ago uh at this point but i've definitely been
talking about it more because there seems to be um definitely here in the u.s but it seems also
in the uk perhaps um i'm not sure about the rest of europe but a renewed uh interest in christianity and
and many public conversions uh often people who have these conversion experiences uh point to the
what they perceive to be the cultural importance of uh traditional christianity um none of that at all
was relevant for me when i was a 19 year old uh at the time i was um very much uh critical of the
biblical traditions my mom's a bit of um evangelical herself um my dad's a
atheist jew though in dialogue with me over the years he's realized he's more of an agnostic actually but
um and so as a teenager i really ran away from my mother's christianity and embraced uh kind of
abrasive uh uh self-assured somewhat obnoxious form of atheism and and scientific materialism and um
you know stephen hawking richard dawkins like as a teenager those were my guys
and then yeah when i was 19 years old um i i got a hold of some uh psilocybin mushrooms for the first
time and uh was just in my dorm room alone i told my roommate what i was doing and i i need you i'll
let you know but i'm just gonna stay in here and journal and um yeah i ingested those uh and as i said
it was my first time doing any sort of a psychedelic more context at the time i was um calling myself
a buddhist and meditating and it was a very americanized like california type of buddhism is like
reading alan watts and um chagyam truncpa and um you know into alan ginsburg and the whole learning
about the 60s counterculture and all of that stuff um and to my great surprise that entire experience
was uh something of a encounter with what i could call maybe in a jungian sense the christ archetype
which maybe makes a little bit more approachable but it didn't feel like a projection of my psyche it
felt like um a being who sort of was hovering just behind my own face and i was you know journaling as
i said and it felt like a kind of automatic writing uh where this being um communicated to me through me
that um that it was the logos and that um i say it i don't necessarily want to gender christ though
usually we say he but that feels inappropriate but i also don't want to impersonalize it um
but this being said i am in you i am in everyone um
um and it it uh it shook me it overwhelmed me not only because it was quite surprising i i had been
spending you know um most of my teens making fun of christianity as the like you uniquely uh
incredible uh religion of all the world religions what it would require one to believe to take seriously
and then to have this experience um humbled me and i realized um subsequently studying
um christianity and judaism more deeply that there's also an esoteric mystical uh stream in the west
uh and i didn't need to go to these um asian religions to find that uh which might be obvious
to a lot of people now that you know there's um mysticism and all the great worlds religions that is
often um considered heterodox or uh blasphemous by by the mainstream um tradition and so yeah since then
um i would say i would say i'm still uh deeply buddhist on some level but there's something about the
incarnational vector that i intuit in um this christ being that strikes me as um
um extremely important that you can get from buddhism like in the bodhisattva's bodhisattva's vow
like this return to the suffering of of the world um and so i don't mean to say that this is an
exclusively christian thing and many christians are so otherworldly and don't have that incarnational
impulse at all um but yeah that's you know the last 20 years um have involved a ever deepening
relationship and i think what you're noticing raul more recently is that i'm talking about this more
because all of a sudden rather than um it being very uncool to be christian it seems now very cool to
be christian it's it's um a rather uh surprising uh but dramatic shift that's occurring and i'm a bit
worried about the reasons people are um listening for why they're converting at this point it seems to
miss the point to me but maybe we can get into that later thank you for sharing that was fascinating
yeah i did lots of questions and thoughts on that but that's very very especially because my i'm going
to keep saying this i'll say it only once so i don't have to say it again but my limited understanding
of process is that process theology is and you mentioned this in the podcast i was listening to
so i feel secure in saying it but uh process theologians are the ones who really kept whitehead
alive and vibrant for a long time i lived with trip fuller uh for a year or more and uh oh he's a
good friend of mine yeah oh yeah he's a dear friend i haven't seen him for years now but we lived together
for a year in torrance and um uh we did many podcasts together so um i know that people like john cobb um
you know i kept whitehead life so it's interesting that that you your interest is not just in process
uh philosophy and whitehead but you have that theological uh bent can i ask very quickly uh did
that which came first uh your interest in process philosophy or the your personal kind of religious
experience uh this experience came first and as a 19 year old i'd probably heard of whitehead
uh but i didn't study whitehead formally until graduate school so three two or three years later
yeah so whitehead gave you a frame potentially to understand what was happening or what had happened
is that correct on some level but you know i i didn't get into whitehead initially through
his theological interpreters like like john cobb and david ray griffin and um charles hartshorn like
i i actually read them much later um i went straight into whitehead's primary texts and was far more
interested in um the ways that his metaphysics allowed me to reinterpret science um in in a less you
know reductionistic materialistic way and then more recently um as i became friends with john cobb um
about 10 years ago uh and um you know really developed a deeper appreciation for his work
uh through that kind of mentorship working with his institute um that i became more um vocal about the
theological aspects of whitehead's work but initially it wasn't the theology that got me into his his
process philosophy yeah interesting now that's that's cool because i was kind of almost assuming
oh maybe it was the theology and then the philosophy but no you were a pure whiteheadian um and came to
the process theology later very interesting sorry anyway just that that's me raul this is your podcast you
are responsible for this so he let you ask the questions no i was just gonna i was gonna ask
peter if you want to just comment on that i'm sure you know given the work you've been doing you've
heard similar kind of testimonies or or perhaps even anti-testimonies uh how people feel out of religion uh
but um i'm curious what your thoughts are on what matt shared yeah so and it actually comes
i was kind of interested in exploring you know the areas of potential uh similarity and the things
that we share in common but interesting starting here is interesting because um i in my around the same
age i was 17 years old i had what is you know called a type of religious experience which is you know
you know not an experience as such but what transforms your experience of everything and
uh that was very fundamental to me as well so that's very interesting but one of the one of my
spiritual uh events was actually a dream where god spoke to me and said i do not exist um and so
interesting almost like two different spiritual experiences here which is obviously led me more to
me more to the radical uh and not more to the process um because you know in radical theology there is a
an emphasis really on discontinuity and alienation and uh a type of inexistent god so my kind of formative
spiritual experience was not the oneness of everything um and not some sort of organic
unity or kind of teleological omega point that we're moving towards but kind of like a uh primordial
negation um and a direct kind of tarring with that primordial negation uh so yeah so i interested
matt the little bit of you know as i say kind of research i've done or thinking is is it feels like
potentially some of your work would be more in line it's interesting you mentioned jung because i
would potentially be say for example more union than freudian but i don't want to put words in your
mouth and more delusian than lacanian um and then again that's probably where there's an interesting
difference in our you know respective uh projects uh but very interested to unpack that yeah i think that's
fair um i've read very little lacan i've read more zizek than lacan and zizek on lacan uh but i definitely
am more at home in in young um delus is very influential for me as well um so but yeah that that
dream you had is quite um it's quite a hegelian comment with god to say i do not exist um nice double
negative uh going on there um double negation and so i i think um yeah i mean i i love you know like
paul tillich i love the existential approach to um theology and recognizing this this um the nature of
desire as a as a lack that like can never be fulfilled and um i i do resist sort of pollyanna
accounts of the relationship between um god and the world and um i don't think that um there is um
um i don't want and resist the idea that faith can become some sort of escape hatch from dealing with
human the complexities of human relationship um and i think you know like zizek's account of um
um jesus becoming an atheist on the cross uh is quite compelling to me and i think that speaks to the
profound transformation that this event is uh supposed to signify and not just signify but to have
uh accomplished in some sense that the divine became human um and so god died uh but something was
resurrected and like that's that's the spirit of humanity in some sense um and that you know now
it's up to us we can't rely on this uh transcendent being to intervene and fix the world for us and so you
know what i like about process theology is it basically says god is not all powerful and to the extent that
god does have any power it comes through um us and so faith becomes a way of lending a hand to the divine
in a way um to live as best we can uh lives of of love and in so doing um god becomes more
real in a way right and to the extent that we don't uh live in that way um god's reality is diminished
you know so it's a fully participatory type of of theology that's um not about petitioning some
all-powerful being to make it all all right um that type of god does not exist absolutely i've
actually been rereading the later bonhoeffer for some stuff i'm doing and in the letters and papers
and i think this is maybe a place of potential connection for us i don't know if if if you've read
later bonhoeffer later bonhoeffer i like but it's very much what you're saying it's the weakness of
god it's a participatory kind of theology and which it's living you know what he calls religionist
christianity and worldly christianity um and i think that there's a real uh connection between
process and radical in in that kind of material kind of way and also in its um here i'll throw out a few
things that i think there's similarities in then we can get to some of the differences i mean one
of the things that shizek says maybe is a difference but is um you know shizek says the
joke of christianity is that you know a person basically is sitting in the pew saying i i want to be
one with god but i feel alone and destitute you know utterly in the dark utterly bereft and of course
god says ah now you're one with me right so for me that's the joke of christianity it's not that you
can that you enter into a kind of you know oneness with god or something but you participate in a
fundamental ontological alienation but what's process and radicals seem to both have is one is
there's a notion of freedom spontaneity novelty at the heart of the universe um there is there is
something that breaks the determinist chain uh you know quantum dimension or whatever that so there's
a notion of freedom uh it's post kantian you know we're we're both kind of in the title of your book
crossing the threshold we're both attempting to or saying that we can hit the real uh another thing that
i i when i was listening to you speak and in a podcast you did uh you mentioned i'm going to say
this in different words and maybe not as well but but that there is a a type of um affect or a type of
way of being that an aesthetic you know a way of touching the real touching reality and in psychoanalysis
you know there that's the same there and that's the symptom basically the symptom is where we touch
the real and what and the affect is jouissance and jouissance is the name of hitting the real desire is
for what you don't have jouissance is um hitting the negativity at the heart of everything so that
it's so there's a but there is a similar there's a similar thinking and what i'm doing with paro theology
where we hit the real there is it's not a post-structuralist uh kind of openness to a future
that's kind of like uh it's not a canty and kind of the numinal is out of reach there is a way to
touch the real and i hear that in your work as well um so those are a few of the things that i think
there might be similarities spontaneity hitting the real um and i can't remember what the other one i i said
was but were the potential differences is maybe in this notion of freedom freedom on freedom yes
freedom's another thing yeah sorry thank you freedom um the thing that i hear but i think i might be
wrong here's my instinct in terms of talking to process the illusions um is that god is an god is
still an object like so lacan's critique of object relations is object relations as we have internalized
objects of our mothers and fathers and we relate to these and how we relate to these affect our lives
and lacan comes along and talks about his critique of object relations is he says no it's object a
relations is the it's our relation to negativity that transforms us so um and so in radical theology you
have notion of like god is the name for a radical negativity uh but can you riff off that comment
and tell me you know help me refine it uh what god is within say process theology or within your thinking
yeah well thanks for laying that out uh really interesting this will be juicy um
um god is still an object in process theology um yeah i mean i can see how there might be an easy
critique of like whitehead doing you know he process in reality comes out in 1929 the same time as
uh being in time by heidegger and you might read whitehead for the first time and think oh he's doing
onto theology um but i i i don't i don't think it's that simple um so let me give an account of um the
motivations for his metaphysical project um which he undertook at a time when metaphysics was uh becoming
rather unpopular um so he discusses uh aristotle and says aristotle was the last um philosopher the
theologians say to discuss god in a dispassionate and non-religious way uh and aristotle of course
uh points to god as uh unmoved mover as an explanation for why there's motion uh in in the
cosmos whitehead says that contemporary physics doesn't have that problem uh but there's an
analogous issue which for whitehead was uh not the source of motion but um the source of uh concrete
actuality um how do you go from infinite possibility to some concrete actuality and so his uh i like this
term divine function is i think isabel stingers comes up with that his divine function uh is an
attempt to give an account for how we move from infinite possibility to something definite so he says
in science in the modern world his 1925 book god is the principle of limitation or the principle of
concretion um his ultimate category is creativity and god is actually a creature of creativity um like the
rest of us though what makes god different is god is the primordial creature so god gives the first
god gives creativity a character um god values this realm of infinite possibility to give it some um some
vector to make some uh possibilities more important than others and then that um that vector that sort of
um tilt added to this realm of possibilities then is inherited by all the subsequent creatures to to
become as their initial aim he says and that initial aim doesn't determine what creatures do but it provides
a sense of relevant novelty relevant possibility um whitehead phrases this nicely in his book religion in the
making he says god in this function um of providing relevant novelty to each creature is like holding up a
mirror to reflect back to each creature its own greatness what it could be um but how a creature decides to
actualize itself um is uh up to it right god's not determining that so this is all the primordial nature
of god uh and whitehead's account of god has these two these two poles to it because he's trying to do
justice both to our intuition of permanence um and some sense of eternal value while also doing uh justice to
our sense of our sense of history uh becoming loss perishing um and he doesn't want god to just be this
um distant i i come up i came up with this term possibility sort of architect of possibility uh but
that god is also a fellow sufferer uh who is in the world with the world experiencing all the joys and
suffering of all finite creatures and that would be the consequent nature of god um now
the primordial nature of god is described by whitehead as deficient in actuality but yearning for
actuality and so there's a lack in this primordial nature and um the only and also the primordial nature
is described as unconscious now admittedly um lots of process theologians have argued over this for
decades um it seems like there's two gods in whitehead's thought there's this primordial and
consequent pole or the mental pole of god and the physical pole of god it's like well how did the two
really fit together can can god be both eternal and temporal and historical and i think if we if we're
able to think dialectically yes um but that does put a sort of instability or you could in hegelian
terms say a kind of negativity at the heart of um this vision of the divine that uh nothing is
ever finally settled god is continually being disrupted uh by this by creativity which whitehead also
calls the principle of unrest and so god is as subject to this um creative onrush uh as as any other
creature and uh it's precisely for that reason that god is not all-powerful um and and so the process
conception of god is both uh as a source of um refreshment uh and a sense of relevant novelty but
also a sense of companionship that this is not um a god that exists outside the world this is a god that
exists uh and suffers with the world um and so god is as much subject as object as much um
a lack as a presence um and i do think there's a radical negativity in this vision in the sense that
um you know the creation is never finished uh and nor is is god actually a completed
being god is growing with each experience with every life and death of every creature uh and so
there's a sense in which um that divine
yearning uh is unquenchable um
um and so again i don't i don't read this as as just saying uh god is um an object that would uh
resolve all the tensions of of life and and becoming god is not a being god is becoming with us
i was right to ask actually i mean would you say i think i was thinking you wouldn't say us but maybe
you would but the god is the name of the process the process itself is god the signifier of the fact
that the universe is in a type of creative flux so that's so the signifier god just names the process
itself i think that's fair so that god becomes you know you have creativity which doesn't have
a vector it's it's you creativity is kind of akin to nothing or chaos or you know um and god gives it
both aim and um memory as it were so so that process can become um a it takes on a trajectory it has it has
purpose but it's never going to arrive at some finished state and so yeah whitehead's theology uh is
an attempt to give um to provide an account of aim and memory at the at the cosmic scale
right so that we would be able to describe the universe in terms of um process that's it's not
aimless process and it's process that builds on itself and so that something is uh recollected and
indeed from whitehead's point of view nothing is ever forgotten everything which occurs becomes
objectively immortal right and is uh contributing to the further creative advance of the universe
and god plays that role um so god and process you could say are equivalent concepts yeah yeah um
will i jump in i yeah you're happy enough um uh okay let me give you a definition of where i
think of god and tell me where you think that you differ because i'm interested as far as this is
a conversation where i'm just really wanting to learn and tease out the differences um
but and then you know there's because there's we both have this notion of freedom but for me freedom
isn't the agency and so uh you know and i'll see what you think of this when i talk about when in
terms of psychoanalysis they talk about freedom freedom is not uh you know obviously the ability
to choose one direction over another um freedom is the name for a type of cuts within the causal chain
um it's a type of you know non-non-totality and this is why in psychoanalysis your freedom is
connected with the symptom it's connected with the very thing that you think you cannot control the
very thing washing your hands excessively or something like that and in other words um the freedom
is where you are through on work consciously you'd be like create you know you would be a utilitarian
maximize your pleasure minimize your pain uh you know we have like a life drive all of this stuff that
at a conscious level utilitarianism makes total sense and then and then you do something that acts
against your self-interest that you you act in not in accordance with what would seem like the basic
rules of evolutionary psychology or whatever um and this is the moment of freedom because this is the
moment of derailment of of the causal chain and something a new an event happens a new possibility
erupts that reconfigures the past but all of that to say um you know if you take basic classical theism
saying god exists and classical atheism saying god does not exist then you know the radical theology says
god is the name for the inexistent thing so god is simply the name for the way in which everything
orbits orbits around a type of contradiction or asymmetry um and and because everything revolves
around a type of asymmetry uh a non-totalizable kernel um then there's within language and within our bodies
i'll say it's a simple way within language we can never say everything we want to say there's a constant failure
um and within our bodily pleasure there is a constant failure like we never we always get
commodities and they never satisfy and so mimetically we want other commodities and this goes on forever
but in terms of desire that's how desire works but jouissance is when you hit on the negativity and
you directly enjoy negativity so if demand is you enjoy an object and desire is you enjoy a lost object
something an object you can never get then drive is enjoyment of loss itself and jouissance is a
connection with um the affect that comes out of a direct enjoyment of of circling lack all of this to
say and this is why it feels less metaphysical in process i think you know that for me i i don't want
to say it's it's like carl bart to me is if you buy it at the beginning you can take the whole thing but
if you don't buy the the the the fundamental premise it's hard to jump into but within within
what i'm doing with paratheology the idea of god as the name for the non-oneness of reality with itself
and religious experience as an encounter with that radical negativity enduring and enjoying that
negativity and freedom arises erupts out of hitting that negativity so anyway that's just some thoughts
i could go deeper but um so i i wonder if this is if this parallels something um in process theology and
whitehead's thought where um you know he would say in every moment of our experience of what's been
actualized already so taking in the whole of our past lives um we're also aware of or his term would
be prehending we might not be consciously aware of it but we're also prehending everything which has
not been actualized right and so this negativity as it were is also hail haloing everything that actually
has been realized and so you know one of the reasons he finds it necessary as a metaphysician to make
reference to god is he he needs some some way to um uh account for that all that unrealized possibility
all that um negativity as it were that hasn't been positively actualized and so he points to to the
divine as as sort of the um that which shelters these unrealized possibilities um and and allows us to still be
um uh for those for those possibilities to still be accessible to us in some way right and so you
know he speaks in terms of possibility potentiality not in terms of negativity but um to the extent that
this is a um you know his account of like what a thing is includes not just what it is but everything
that it's not you know and and definitely is building on a kind of hegelian uh logic here it's just that
he wants it to be as he says at the beginning of processing reality um he's seeking a kind of realism
organic realism he says but at the end of the day it could just be um equivalent to absolute idealism
um that that the final interpretation is actually not that divergent um in in terms of freedom
you know i'm also i've been very influenced by schelling and i uh perhaps inappropriately try to um
appropriate him as a process uh theologian uh and process philosopher um but you know his account of
freedom um in uh philosophical investigations into the essence of human freedom uh when i when i first
read that really shook me because as you're saying this isn't like the freedom to choose this or that
um this is a deeper cut or a a decision that we make uh almost uh primordially or eternally
that primordial decision yeah yeah yeah yeah um that that determines our character uh our personality
in some sense so it's like the choice we make that is the condition for the possibility of these
either or types of choices um it's it's like the it's this freedom as this sort of self uh transcending
creativity and what's fascinating about whitehead's account of um of decision as it were he calls it
concrescence um and he doesn't limit it to just human beings you know for whitehead um creativity
the capacity for self-creation is uh cosmically distributed and human beings uh might be self-conscious
of this capacity for decision but it's not it's not unique to us um we're not the only creatures
capable of self-creating even though there's a paradox in that um his account of the concrescence
of an actual occasion of experience um is a process of self-creation though also always um inheriting
a uh a history in a context but adding something novel um and the way that that process works involves
uh three basic phases inheriting of the objectified past subjectively experiencing that in the present
and then perishing into what he calls um superjectivity where the values we realize in that moment of
subjectivity interpreting um the objective past in a unique way is then passed on to the future for
the next round of concrescence to inherit and so if we think about this in in human terms and try to
understand freedom our capacity to to creatively self-transcend or to exercise uh freedom to to uh realize a
free deed actually depends on dying to ourselves as subjects in the present and giving whatever value
we think we have realized uh the effects of this decision we've made to the next concrescent subject
so for whitehead there's no enduring subject first of all i should say that like we are ourselves a kind of
stream of um uh of subjects of occasions of experience that inherit from one another very intimately
but i'm constantly in a situation of having to interpret my present uh self to my past self
uh in the effort to construct a future self um but the the point here is that in order to uh affect
my future selves as it were i have to die to myself in the present and so freedom is in some sense um
self-sacrificial as it were um i don't get to experience the effects of my free decision in
the present that would be the next uh occasion of experience that's inheriting that decision
right and so we're constantly having to give ourselves over uh to the future in this attempt
to exercise freedom so it's never my freedom right it's almost like freedom as a gift to the other
who will be me in the future uh but there's a sense in which my relationship to my future
selves is not different and kind from my relationship to you uh right it's just the difference of the
degree of intimacy of these occasions of experience as they inherit from one another um so i'm done i'm
jumping right into whitehead's metaphysics and i know it might be gonna say like it's very metaphysically
dense it's very metaphysically rich and i'm always you know i'm listening going like okay um yeah so so
god functions for whitehead as a way of um uh understanding this process um so god god is a necessary
dimension for white even whitehead i've never really i read a little bit of that uh his gifford
lectures that process and whatever but very little i've so so i'm really honestly um learning here but
but god is a necessary hypothesis for whitehead in order to uh uh give a foundation to this metaphysics
is that is that right is that yes but he does say that um god is the ultimate irrationality uh
but then after so so there's something contingent about um god's emergence out of creativity and yet
after that contingent uh emergence occurs god then becomes necessary for all subsequent
uh uh uh um creaturely activity and and uh cosmogenesis and so god begins as contingent and then becomes
necessary like it didn't have to happen it's this isn't um god is not necessary being it's not it's not
like an ensemble sort of argument um it's it's that uh i mean in some sense whitehead's a radical empiricist
in the jamesian sense and says hey we have this ordered cosmos it's not perfectly ordered so god
can't be all powerful but there does seem to need to be some account given for the origins of order
um and so whether that means god's a necessary hypothesis i mean when you say hypothesis it means
we're going to test this out and i think that's fair um he would say that this idea of god that he
is constructed and it's a metaphysician's god he says this might secondarily evoke religious emotion
but his primary purpose here is to make sense of of the universe to make sense of physics and biology
and human psychology um and so a necessary hypothesis might be a fair way of phrasing it so long as we
don't mistake that for some kind of logical proof of the existence of god this is a hypothesis rooted in his
consideration of the empirical evidence and what would be the necessary condition to make what we
experience including all of our scientific uh understanding uh possible yeah okay let me because
yeah that's fascinating and let me then give you a definition of of how i think about god again and see
what again let push back on what you agree with or disagree with um it's because you know without
you know less metaphysics really if you take girdle's incompleteness theorem and i forget the
mathematician who simplified it but i'm going to use the simplification it's very good for people
who are listening and watching um if we imagine a universal computational machine that can compute
anything anything that's computable uh there's one thing that it cannot compute uh similar to kind of
marx's proletariat or something one thing is outside the system but there's one thing the computer cannot
compute and this if you put into the computer uh this computer cannot prove that a so so this is given a
this statement is given a a this state uh the universal computational machine cannot prove that a is
true and then you put that into the machine uh and if it proves it's true then it's false but if it
doesn't prove it's it's it's true then you know it hasn't proved it so basically you've got an idea
something that is true but not provable so what you know what i want to say about god is god is true but
not provable um god is the name for yes something that is absolutely true uh and absolutely um real uh
and absolutely uh impossible to prove god is the type of net non-at-oneness of in this example the
non-at-oneness of the mathematical system with itself right a sufficiently complex mathematical system cannot
uh there's always be something that is true but not provable and that's simply it so god again is
just the signifier of this radical negativity that generates complexity but i feel you've got a much
more substantive view of god than that that's what i'm kind of sensing so i guess that's what i'm trying
to trying to poke and prod um that more there's something i think more substantial
about your your approach um so whitehead was very familiar with the limits of logic uh yes
i mean worked with russell on the principia and all of the paradoxes that they ran into
uh yeah because of course russell's paradox is a great example yes you know russell's paradox is
another example of that so yes keep going right right i mean the the the the liar's paradox right
the a cretin says all cretins are liars what do you do with that um and i think while russell and
whitehead both made a valiant effort to um cash in on this uh the the promise of logicism which is that
one could ground all mathematics in they were working with the logic of sets and eliminate any need for
intuition uh and all they wanted to do was was really prove that one plus one equals two and they
you know i i think we have to say the principia was both a tremendous success and a tremendous failure
um the success in the sense that it inaugurated this new approach to philosophy using logical analysis
um and the propositional functions that i think um was a tremendous advance on the other hand um
the logicist project would prove to be untenable and girdle a few decades later would prove
why uh and whitehead makes note of that in his last book uh modes of thought i think girdle's
incompleteness theorems came out in 33 um whitehead's last book was 38 and he mentions this um
and whitehead basically says that um logic we have to understand logic as a subset of aesthetics
and the reason um that uh you know
we have a sense of logical truths and can make logical judgments is is that there's a it's more deeply
rooted in our intuitions of harmony uh and um balance and and that these are ultimately um
aesthetic factors and so when he thinks of the divine he's not thinking of a grand logician of some
kind um he's thinking of of a uh an estate uh god is the poet of the world he says um not as not that god makes the world but god
makes something of the world which is to say um you know the world is in process creatively advancing
god can't stop it uh but god is able to um god is that which allows us to make meaning of that uh
uh creative onrush despite the wreckage of history uh it's that which uh allows us to still feel like um
reconciliation is possible um and you could say this is akin to a kind of deferral um
uh of that reconciliation that that you know god is always to come and has never finally arrived um
yeah i think there are readings of whitehead's theology uh in that sense but you know what's great
about what whitehead left us with with this very abstract metaphysical account of the divine function
let's call it is that you can come in there as a theologian with a religious purpose in mind
uh and and as a person of faith looking to understand your experience and it's like all
whitehead gave us was the bare sketch and we can come in there and fill it in with color
um in a whole variety of ways and he wanted an account it's a theistic account obviously but
he wanted one that would be at least um um that there would be something there for every religious
tradition to work with uh theistic or not to make sense of um the nature of the cosmos that we inhabit
whether we're buddhists or muslims or jews or christians uh or you know various forms of indigenous
spirituality what have you he wanted there to be he was seeking a language that would be generic enough
that everyone could recognize uh themselves in it to some degree right and so it's a very abstract
bare bone bare bones account um but i think he's ultimately approaching metaphysics at this later
phase of his life you know decades after the principia project um not as the attempt to uh
uh sort of deduce the world from logical principles uh but rather to begin with our human experience
including our religious experiences the whole history of religious experience our artistic
experience and our scientific experience as well as our sort of hardcore common sense presuppositions
like uh our sense of having some degree of agency and um you know that uh um
yeah and so his account is um looking at everything that we experience across all these domains and
trying to distill a set of categories which would allow us to describe it um metaphysically speaking but
always he wants those metaphysical categories to remain um subject to revision in light of new
experience uh and in light of uh yeah how close yeah i mean how closely aligned then do you think this
kind of thinking is with someone like john caputo i can i can see differences and similarities i'm almost
triangulating radical theology weakness theology process as as as as having some sort of family
resemblance but i just in you know in terms of this openness to the future this ongoing kind of like
creative process that potentially is never finalized or finished but you know god is always to come but
are there is this close to caputo's uh work do you think or is it substantively substantively different
or maybe you're not that au fait with caputo i don't know um yeah i've read a little bit of of john caputo's
work i would say there are deep resonances here um i think katherine keller's work would probably be the bridge here
um she's engaged very deeply uh with you know post-structuralism and and derrida and uh and caputo
and i think has um offered a a reading of um whitehead that is responsive to some of their concerns about
the way metaphysics was traditionally done say and um responsive to the concerns about onto theology and
um you know i don't know if you know katherine keller's work so much but she's really developing
a kind of theopoetics rather than a theology in the sense that theology could be a science or something
it's it's more about um evoking uh a sense of aesthetic response to the mystery of existence
um and shifting uh our relationship to god talk away from certainties and uh proofs uh more in this
artistic uh aesthetic poetic direction so that we recognize that we're um that theology is more like
like it's more like painting uh than it is like uh science if that makes sense yeah i accept then
with process but they're still like with someone like caputo you know god is almost always
yeah to come there that it is one of his smaller books on religion he really picks up on uh augustine
when he says what do i love when i love my god and the confessions and it's like this there's no
doubt that i love i love god but there's this constant you know it's a master signifier you can
never fill it with meaning almost like anselm's definition of god is god is the name for that
which cannot be named it like in a nutshell the proslogue and god is a name for that which cannot be
conceptualized so god is a signifier that signifies something that cannot be signified and therefore
there is this openness and this question this creativity um but for someone like derrida it's uh
it feels more atheistic than pro than process theology seems it always seemed to me process theology to be
in this confessional theology camp um but i could be wrong again i could be wrong about that but that's
and i i'm but it seemed like you know process is more standardly the theistic um then you know you've
got your caputo who's more uh atheistic but but in a kind of um just that there's a continual openness
a continual slippage a continual continual inability to name that draws us and then with someone like the
can it's much more god is the name for that which doesn't exist so it's it's much more redouble the
atheism yeah yeah well i mean one of the things i really appreciate about about uh catherine's or
catherine keller's work is her engagement with negative theology and um the way that um we can't simply
conceive of god as the highest being um that that that god is as much uh in the lowest as in the highest
and and that god is um it's true whitehead as a metaphysician throws this term around um and it can be
kind of an embarrassment um i mean i'm sitting here after an hour of us talking about about god and i've
said so much and i should admit um what i've been doing is trying as best i can to um offer an account
of uh whitehead's work here but for me um this term is is so both potent and pathetic at the same time
by which i mean it has tremendous um cultural power both to move people in a variety of directions
and so we have to be careful with it but we also don't want to take it too seriously because we want
to take ourselves too seriously when we talk about it um and so yeah i i guess i'm feeling in this moment a
bit of um the need for some i'm feeling anxiety about all the god talk we've been doing and my own sense
of um of complete inadequacy when it comes to actually pretending to understand how it all works uh yeah
and i think whitehead provides us with a me at least with a kind of um scaffolding that takes my rational
mind as far as it can go and that feels um more or less adequate to my to my experience though of course
there are holes there are things that don't find a place in his otherwise somewhat miraculously
comprehensive scheme um but yeah i guess uh i think um i find the negative theological tradition and
apophasis to be um extremely uh edifying and help um me as my metaphysical side who wants to be able to
spell it all out um it helps me from taking that part of myself too seriously and and to the extent
that there's a confessional side i mean yeah like i we started this with me sharing this religious
experience that i had that um more than any ideas any philosophy i've ever read has shaped who i am as
a human being and um in so many ways my my search for a reasonably satisfying articulation of uh what i
experienced um is secondary to the experience itself and i think how it guides me ethically and and the
meaning that it provides me that is somewhat remains mostly actually ineffable um and i'm always i'm
willing to talk about it you know and i was glad that rahul that you asked but it's also kind of
embarrassing because like i don't know what the hell happened to me and i put i put these words to it
but the reason i share it openly is because it feels i was surprised by it um and though i was you know
raised in uh sort of judeo-christian context um did not expect that to come up in my experience at all you
know um so yeah anyways i just wanted to sort of slow us down and pause and admit um
that i personally am not convinced that whitehead's understanding of this is is the best possible one
we might have um again yeah yeah radical theologians and process theologians really meet each other
um for this reason to keep us both honest like let's push the philosophizing as far as we can but um
let's not pretend like uh we're not still limited finite suffering more or less ignorant beings
yes yes no and you know i appreciate you saying that and um it's interesting because the god talk
is interesting just because god is kind of in a way the ultimate embarrassment the ultimate kind of
symptom the ultimate kind of a religious experience kind of embarrasses one it happens out of the
blue it transforms our trajectory it's kind of so i find it a fascinating conversation um but
precisely yeah for the reason why it's so difficult is there's something about about talking about this
the signifier god is a signifier of that that cannot be signified that that potentially hits on something
it's central to kind of the radical tradition and the process tradition so um but yeah there's this
there's this fundamental limit that i love the way you're speaking and that's kind of what makes it so
endlessly fascinating it's precisely uh that there is that that this brings us to the to a type of limit
i did love in something you talked about in a podcast i listened to and i totally agree with this
however is that that in a way we kind of weirdly have an insight into the universe because we are the
universe having an insight into itself like we are the interiority of the universe and um so and that's
why we're both post-cantians in different ways but there's there's something in which we're both saying
well there's a limit and we're finite but also weirdly um as the universe encountering itself and
thinking itself um pretend well this is what radical theology does with this and i think i think maybe
it's similar to process maybe not but it's almost like it's not just that i am not understanding the
universe um i am the universe not understanding itself and that touches on an ontological
incompleteness within the universe itself and of course she's like loves the example of a computer
game where someone hasn't programmed enough so behind a door there's nothing because the programmers
didn't program up and uh uses that to say that's like quantum mechanics with god you know god didn't
bother the program at the quantum level thought we'd never get there and then we open the door and
it's it's incomplete so we kind of down we got to the incompleteness so yeah um so i it's a way of
turning the not knowing into a knowing not knowing um but again that's what i want to call god i come
back to guess and the name for that ontological unknowing is is god yeah i mean whitehead explicitly says
um that uh the universe is incomplete that there that is an incompletion in the process of production
but it will never arrive that it will never become product um you know and so there's a deep resonance
there and we are caught up in that and so it's like our intuition of that incompleteness
um for whitehead would be our to the extent that we intuit that incompleteness we are partaking in
creativity and to the extent that we uh uh intuit some sense that there's a better and a worse uh uh
you know um that there's that there's beauty and ugliness that there's good and evil that that we
have some sense of a value differentiation um that's our intuition of how the divine participates in that
process of incompletion not to bring it to completion but to give it a direction of some kind
um and so it's like there's this double intuition that we have as as cosmic
creatures um maybe i should say chaosmogenic creatures to throw in a delusian spin on it
because there's not just order it's it's order chaos ongoing genesis but as participants in that
whole process we intuit both the ongoingness of it and the radical open-endedness of it
right the creativity of it but also a sense that um there's some kind of uh advocate some kind of um
of a divine eros that that you know despite all of the chaos and disorder
whitehead would say nature has a tendency to be in tune uh what is that um and you know we have words
for it um but i think we do have this double intuition right that um touches the real allows
us to touch the real in some sense well i've always i've always said the trip fuller that
you know if if you're going to be confe if you're you know if you're in the church if your confessional
process is probably the best one to take that's so i look like if i was if i was to have to choose one
confessional theological position probably process or bart i kind of have a soft swap for carl bart as
well um uh but then of course in implicit into that and folded into that is the idea that i can't quite
bite i can't quite make the leap but if i had to if i did make the leap process seems to me i actually
even in my 20s i read early 20s there were a pile of evangelical christians who got into i was called
was it open theism um i think why wham there was a why whammer and i this is pre me doing philosophy
or anything like that but even though i was like oh okay this is interesting that within evangelicalism
uh there was this idea of a god in process in uh you know on with the future unknown and that kind of
stuff and that that sounded fascinating but yes i am aware then that maybe we should uh change it to a
different topic um raul do you want to direct us at all or are you just yeah i have heaps of notes
and i doubt we'll have time to touch on all of them although i mean i i have two questions here so
one is more like a naive just philosophical question in fact imbued out of a conversation i had with my
partner so like her question was like why even have the god talk we'll leave that for later but one thing i'm
interested in is so i'll say this peter i think i've shared this with you before one reason early
on i was drawn towards your work and then really pyrotheology is because i realized your work doesn't
call for any kind of like spiritual revelation or like i don't have to be saved as you say there's no a
to b a is not a itself right so and i was like yes because i myself i'm not a spiritual person in
fact i joke around when people i say uh i'm religious but not spiritual uh people say the
other way around right so and and and i'm really i'm of two minds about this whole notion of spirituality
and i i love the fact that matt you said that you're kind of ashamed of it because here's the thing
though right with these kinds of spiritual experiences it can be just ethically speaking
for me it's very ethically ambiguous i'll put it this way so you take someone like i don't know uh
a fascist in some sense fascism itself i would argue has this almost like fanatic spiritual element to it
too it's like i am i am you know to use jack's terms i am a tool of the big other i am there's
like a perverse structure in fact recently i'm not saying he's a fascist but he's a neo-fascist
let's say you know trump he uh said when the bullet you know hit him he was like uh i really felt like
this was god telling me to go and do what i have to do uh like god gave me a second chance um
and i'm i don't know if it's a show for him but perhaps he genuinely does believe that that this
was like a sign from you know big other to go and do what he has to do like carry out his calling and
i've always been very skeptical of people that just have this strong conviction that my calling you know
people say my calling was to do this and i hear this you know from especially people in confessional
christianity so just regards yeah spiritual experiences i'm curious to hear do you both
think there is such a thing as an authentic spiritual experience uh and like how yeah how
people because i've heard a lot of people share their spiritual experiences like how in your view
should one deal with this uh if they believe they've had a spiritual experience maybe we'll go
with you matt and then please peter yeah well i mean you bringing up the example of um fascists feeling
inspired by some type of deep uh spiritual spiritual experience is interesting i mean you could just as easily
you know be um an atheist sort of historical materialist who's inspired you know to commit atrocities
because of the end you think you're serving i mean so this doesn't necessarily
um only it's not that only religious people are vulnerable to this type of um over confidence in
a particular dispensation that they feel they've been given but i'm also reminded of um something i
think it was in raul your conversation with peter about a year ago where peter you talked about the
difference between left-wing and right-wing enjoyment um and where left-wing enjoyment is coming to terms
with the inescapable alienation of life and kind of uh just learning to accept the contradiction
inherent in the nature of existence whereas right-wing enjoyment is like oh this alienation could be
overcome and there must be somebody who's preventing me from overcoming it and so let's find let's find
the scapegoats uh and eliminate them um and i think that's um obviously a danger here and i think
i don't think it's it's limited to just spirituality though any kind of ideological fixation or over
certainty um in one's sense of like what the solution the final solution to the problem is uh is
going to be problematic and you know if i were going to simply describe what an authentic spiritual
experience would be um one of its characteristics i think would be humility first of all and a kind of
ecstasis like being outside oneself and so if it's authentic you should actually feel rather disoriented
initially um not certain of anything uh but but uh you've you've become a mystery to yourself um and you
know that might um that ontological shock might lead you to after you know um sort of shamanically
dismembering you and leaving you in pieces you might then pick up the pieces and reassemble yourself into
something uh something else and depending on the context and your prior life experience and yeah like
who's around you like what are the easiest you know uh influences ideologically that you're going to use
to reconstruct a new sense of identity like that could go in different directions but
the experience itself should be shattering um humbling um and and bring you outside of
yourself so that you're less certain about who you thought you were right and so if
i guess i'm distinguishing here between authentic spiritual experience and a kind of conversion
um i didn't experience what happened to me at 19 as a conversion i didn't start calling myself a
christian i didn't start going to a particular church i still don't go to a particular church
so for me it's not so much it wasn't a religious conversion it was an encounter with a being
that was as real as anything i've ever experienced i didn't need a religious or institutional context
for it i didn't need to give myself a new label afterwards um but i grant that sometimes there
are conversion experiences that seem very authentic because the person is totally different afterwards
but now they're fixated on like oh this is the truth um this is what's wrong with the world now i know
you know and i think that's um that might be different than how i would want to define an authentic
spiritual experience which i think is initially not going to leave us with certainty um
what do you think yeah so i'm gonna i'll outline as quickly as possible it might take me a few minutes
to um a possible structure for how i think by religious experience which i think will touch on some of
what you're saying and you know in in some respects it's going to sound like the opposite of course and
then we'll find out how to square that circle or if we can but yeah you know in terms of um
the apophatic tradition you know spiritual experience is a saturated phenomenon a phenomenon of being
overwhelmed by the over proximity of that which is otherwise than being right not dissimilar from
freud's early notion of trauma as a happening that cannot be symbolized so it's a truth and event that
that overwhelms you and you cannot symbolize it uh you don't have the ability to symbolize it and so
it it exists as uh as a real as as a something that is unsymbolizable so that's kind of broadly
speaking the apophatic idea and that's the kind of experience and you mentioned psilocybin you know
like you you can like that you can name you can go with that happened on the 21st of june at five o'clock
right it's something that happens in history at a particular time at a place you can note where it
happened i've had a few of those myself you know so anyway um then there's like the the existential
notion of religious experience so in paul tillick what's interesting for paul tillick is he basically
you know he says god is the ground out of ground of being out of which everything arises so his god is
pre-subject object so we are all marked by a loss as we come out of the ground of being we are marked by
again using the freud's thing of like you know separation from the mother the separation marks
you eternally with a loss and so for paul tillick religious experience is the experience of law of
of loss of desire of and of ultimate concern uh you know for the philosopher it's truth for the
artist it's beauty for the activist it's justice but this is something that can never be got uh
the philosopher argues about truth but in a sense they're embedded in truth so even though they can
never define truth the very argument itself testifies to what they do not have so what i
like about paul tillick is spiritual experience is not something that some individual has occasionally at
a certain point spiritual experience is what everybody is having all the time and therefore the church is
about you know helping you uh embrace that experience of loss that marks us in our being
and be driven towards ultimate concern right that's that now then the position that i'm interested in
the is the position in which um not that religious experience primarily is the encounter with a
hyper presence that cannot be symbolized or experienced uh not simply that we are marked by a loss
and religious experience is really uh tiring with that loss realizing that not closing it down into
you know as you were talking about like into something that you can have you know nation or whatever it is
it's a constant openness to the future very deridean um but but religious experience is is a loss so all
of these have negativity by the way so the the the apophatic is a negativity that comes from hyper
presence hyper saturation so we desire not because of a lack but because of a overwhelming experience
but there's still a negativity there's something you can't grasp by being overwhelmed
now freud later changed his theory of trauma to what basically makes something traumatic is the unknown
the question of the other's desire in what happens what is traumatic is what does the other want from me
he calls the dusting of the other that some other doesn't just abuse me but there's a look in their
face the enjoyment they're having that cannot be expressed something traumatic about the unknown
one dimension of the other that this is key to it to what i think religious experiences but um so you
have the apophatic you have until like negativity um in a much more decor desire we have desire we
haven't you know the proof of religious experience is the proof of desire we are desirous and desire
exists because there is a lost object and that's spiritual experience um but the radical position
is not simply not that god is hyper hyper being nor ground of being but rather that negativity is in the
heart of god itself uh negativity is in the absolute so and the difference is this is this is similar to
freud's drive theory is in if desire is a sense of it being a bit depressed because you can never get what
will satisfy you then drive theory is enjoying the loss um and the loss as the reception right the loss
is the thing you want um and so that's what the you know earlier i mentioned the joke of she's heck
which is you know not a funny but the joke is in the logic um that a that i experience uh loss alienation
darkness and darkness and then i realize that that loss alienation and darkness is woven into the very
fabric of the universe itself and by identifying in a transitive way with the alienated christ you know
with the with with the crucified god the extrated god um i uh that lack is forgiven not paid it's not
filled it the the nothing is rendered nothing that the lack is no longer an oppressive force so in all
of that i want to say that very quickly i know i'm sorry i'm taking time here um to to very quickly
define knowledge and belief um i want to define knowledge and this connects with can't a lot
define knowledge is the one thing we know is that we do not know right i want to i i can't show my
working out so i'm just going to have to say it everybody believe me for a second probably not
right but let's pretend i am right that the one thing we can do is that that there is a limit to
our knowledge now in the in the kind of freudian lichenian tradition this is the idea of there's
frustration castration privation frustration is the infant experiences they were they're hungry but they
don't get food all the time right there's frustration it's it's inherent we experience frustration as an
infant castration is when you realize that that the other who feeds you is also lacking and then
privation is the encounter with lack at the heart of everything right there's a sense in which
everything is castrated there's that so that's those are the three now if we take that as knowledge
what do we know now i'm not talking about knowledge in terms of conscious belief i'm talking about
subjective registration we register in our being that there is lack and that's evidenced in our
language where we can't say everything we want to say and in our desire which can never be fulfilled
then belief i would argue is what covers over that knowledge belief is ideology belief is the blanket we put
on to to avoid a confrontation with knowledge and one of the ways that works is disavowal you know i
know that astrology won't tell me who i should marry nevertheless i consult the stars right so it's it's
you know but nevertheless you believe so that's how i would define knowledge and belief and then for me
uh that what i call church of the contradiction the radical church it's it is a ritual that is designed
to um critique belief so as you encounter the knowledge that you know so that you directly
encounter lack you directly tarry with it you directly engage with it so so basically i call it a communion
of non-believers is what the church is communion of non-believers a social bond based upon um the embrace
of lack without the ideological cover of belief and here's then sorry unless with this i'll finish um
religious experience then for me is jouissance it is the when you hit the radical negativity
like a little hammer you hit the real um the affect is jouissance which which in effect is an absolutely
overwhelming experience like being on psilocybin it can be it can be an absolutely
anxiety producing an intense um experience of of the lack and that's why i think a genuine religious
experience cannot be neo-fascist or fascist in the sense of it is it is a direct confrontation with
a fundamental alienation that is enjoyable yeah i mean
i i i resonate with all of that i the term that comes to mind is kenosis self-emptying a genuine
spiritual experience is self-emptying right and so i think that inoculates it against the fascist
appropriation yeah and yeah and just on that thank you that's brilliant as i to add one thing is because
i lived in la for many years and um you know religious experience in la is very much seen as
a really nice experience something wonderful something you want something you want to invite
something amazing something that you know you want to go up to the mountain you want to do your ayahuasca
retreat you know it's something even if it's going to be difficult you kind of want it but i think the
interesting thing about christianity is the christian experience is crucifixion it's precisely affliction
it's precisely a type of radical suffering and i think simone vey is brilliant on this i'm sure
simone vey has some resonance i would from listening to you i was like oh i i think some
of what you say reminds me of vey and i love vey but it's like it's like you cannot want religious
experience for simone vey it's like you can't want that because who wants crucifixion who wants
affliction who wants to identify with christ you know there's a subjective destitution is what
lacan calls it there's actually something that we consciously cannot want we can't consciously
want our own destruction our own be derailment free we're condemned to freedom as sarah says i love
that thing we don't want free freedom is horrific but but religious experience is when we hit the real
and it's awful and amazing and you can i don't think we can want it i think i love what you said about
it's embarrassing it's embarrassing it's scandalous it's ridiculous um and for me it is where we
encounter the truth beautiful beautiful uh i think that's where if there's any kind of what i would
call bridges or synergies that's where i see it um because yeah you know like i've been really thinking
about this notion of people they call it uh you know come to jesus so having like this conversion
and uh it's interesting right like some may say um whatever public figures when they say oh i found
christ i'm a christian now that some may say oh it's this is like you know cultural christianity or
like political so one person i can uh name here is this uh she was a big atheist i i had her cla she
was a part of like the richard dawkins group and recently she became a christian and she is what you
would as you say matt be called a cultural christian however for me as a lakayan jikian i think as we all
know that the truth is out there it's so even if it's some kind of performance that is her truth
and then i'm always questioning well um yeah i mean as you as you would mention like is this
what spirituality or like an authentic moment is however i think it's i like the way you outline
differences peter uh okay that that was beautiful thank you so much guys um this is really my last
question and the reason i want to keep it here is i recently have been trying i'd say recently in
the past six months or so just like almost naively revisiting these fundamental philosophical questions
like you know what is the good life aristotle you know like i can't really play to trying to get
through these works um and one and of course religion is a part of this so a bit of a story
here sorry i'm being a bit long-winded but i was having a conversation with my partner my partner is
not religious at all in fact she gets annoyed whenever i mention religion uh so and then i was
kind of trying to outline some of your work peter and of course matt your work i'm trying to like
show that you know like for her i think her religion is really the religion of like growing up in a
church that sort of confessional christianity so she sees i'm like no there are other ways to
work through religion and then like for instance um as you mentioned peter for you god might be a
signifier for lack and then perhaps for you matt if i might say god is a signifier for creativity
and then one one thing she mentioned which i think is a good point i kind of agree with her is like
yeah i mean why even use the religious language you know why even have god like doesn't god
over complicate things here so i would i mean i have my own way of answering that but i'm curious to hear
if someone like that really like like let's say hard nose richard dawkins type atheist comes and says yeah
why even put the word signifier of god or jesus or whatever you may call it and just speak of the
thing as the thing without putting this uh this other let's call it superfluous um signifier how would
you how would you both respond to that sort of uh let's say critique yeah he wants to go first
maybe matt you can go first and then peter i'm sympathetic to that critique you know you use a
word like god and um it will be understood in a whole variety of different ways by different people
and um you know i also don't believe in the god that richard dawkins doesn't believe in you know so
um i think it's it's a problematic term and yet sometimes you just have to dive in there and activate
um all of that uh cultural history and all of the um uh contemporary controversy um so you you throw
out a word like that to signify that you want to get into that stuff and you know if there ever was
a word that's difficult to define i mean i don't know how many people who especially who haven't
cracked open any of whitehead's books will understand a word of what i was trying to
say earlier about the primordial the consequent nature and all of this um
and so i i'm i'm sympathetic to the critique of the use of such language when
we don't mean uh this as process theologians say we don't mean the traditional omnipotent creator god
and yet at the same time i i wouldn't want to so sever my connection to that whole lineage
uh with the there's there's something hubristic in thinking oh well we could just start over and
i'll invent a new language and we won't have to deal with all that baggage um it's sometimes i
feel it's actually more it's not just a strategic move but it i'm actually able to communicate more
effectively by uh using the word but saying oh okay this god we've been imagining god as a creator
but what if god is more like the relator not the creator like in other words the condition for
relationship um then all of a sudden like you still have the resonance with this older concept of god
but you're twisting it you're you're transforming it and so there's continuity but there's there's also
a difference and i feel like that can still be that can still be powerful and if we throw out the
word entirely then i sometimes i'm not sure um that we're still able to address the the the depths of
of human experience in the right way um and you know or maybe other languages that allow us to get to
that level of depth um but the g word is is such a an effective uh stick of dynamite sometimes that i'm
hesitant to totally do without it yeah for me um and this is where you know i think both matt and i in different
ways find this signifier to be vitally important right so and i'll say why i think it is you know
like um is it for me so right at the beginning say the signifier god with with anselm and you see it
in student acsc but almost god is a signifier that names something that cannot be signified so already
it's like the zero it's when mathematics created zero they they they had a symbol for nothing and in fact
supposedly that was very controversial some people thought it was the devil's number right because
you know god is everything you know what is what is sin what is the devil lack the kind of
the the the privation so the devil's number is zero because you're naming privation you're naming nothing
um uh but in a way uh god was the signifier that signifies that which cannot be signified you know
say anselm built a whole you know ontological argument that you know uses this but that if
you can conceive of some if i can conceive of god then i can conceive of something greater than god
which is namely i can conceive that there is something i cannot conceive right and you can't
conceive of something greater than god so therefore god must be greater than conception right and that's
just so so already you have this signifier to what you know in psychoanalysis call a master signifier
um for me religion at its best has always been about negation right then i'm signifying something
that can be signified this is vitally important uh for me god and this is why christianity is very
vitally important to me is uh the crucified god the dead god means also that this negativity is not simply
because you know god is beyond all understanding but this negativity is in the heart of the absolute
which is a mythological way of saying that lack is woven into everything so the crucified god
image for me is the privileged way of describing the non-one-ness of the universe with itself
and i think in terms of the modern world in biology this was evolution the non-one-ness of the organism
which creates you know biological complexity in mathematics girdles and completeness theory the
a kind of contradiction within mathematics that kind of allows for the mathematical system uh in
uh politics democracy the non-one-ness of the political body with itself that creates
civilization uh in physics kind of uh you know wave particle duality super positioning and on
the non-one-ness of physical reality with itself um in in psychoanalysis the unconscious not as a as a
substantive thing but rather as the non-one-ness of subjectivity with itself or of consciousness with
itself so the subject is not a thing the subject is the eruption of the non-one-ness of consciousness
right but all of those for me are subspecies of the crucified christ
um and what what you get in the apostle paul is in a cultic way he goes like there's something
significant about the idea of an alienated god of a crucified god there's something salvatore about
that then luther raises it to the dignity of theology uh then hegel to the dignity of philosophy then
nietzsche to an existential salvatore event and then freud and lacan i think create the technology of the
the death of god right that's my genealogy in a nutshell i think i've shared that before in your
podcast but um uh so in a in a world of pure positivity seize the day be all that you can be
maximize uh all of that the the idea that of a pure negativity of an of a nothing uh is as scandalous
now as it ever was and for me as i said like theology says god exists the atheism says god does not exist
but this idea simone vey talks about god is the name of the inexistent thing i think that we have
to have a way not only a name for this negativity we need a liturgy of negativity so more important than
god i'm i'm arguing for god here but hey i'll argue for the church even more important right which is a
liturgy that that through music and comedy and art and ritual and spoken word and storytelling in this
liturgical space you encounter lack privation unknowing in the art you you interject that and
through the liturgy you're able to embrace this negativity and live into the world right these are
not just things i think are important i like i've dedicated my life to to god and the church in the
church of the contradiction and the signifier god because i think it's they're absolutely vital i
think that when we lose the the negativity um it is disastrous no you can't lose it i mean that's
what i say because you can't lose it for me it's everywhere all the time happening but when you cover
over it with a blanket of belief with a blanket of ideology you end up with incredibly destructive
societies and world so i'm not only advocating for god as the name for the non-at-oneness of
everything with itself uh christ as identifying with that non-at-oneness within yourself but liturgy as
playing out in a in a scene like uh you know in a in a perverse sero masochistic scene or whatever
where you create a scene where you play something out the church of the contradiction creates a scene
in which you play out the opposite of the perverse fantasy the sero masochistic fantasy where the
other is complete right the fetish is the object that makes you think the other is complete but this
is a non-fetishistic scene in which you encounter the radical negativity of everything so that you
discover that nothing lives uh in a sense that the lack exists nothing binds what unifies us all what
joins us the social bond is that we all have lack and nothing saves that there's an emancipatory
dimension to this encounter with radical asymmetry
beautiful beautiful yeah i mean i don't know peter if you recall you had a conversation with
uh cadel on his you know on philosophy portal and like one thing i even i even commented on on the on
the video saying that i mean i see this in both of your works really it's this notion of an imminent
critique so like and that's more effective like the way hegel does with metaphysics you don't start
with really any presuppositions except you go into the system and critique it from within and i think
i think that that's where there can be genuinely something new that can come out of it because like
of course uh which is why as you pointed out matt um yeah the the interest in um new atheism it's
really it's really i mean i don't even know if the movement exists anymore in any any proper way
uh and i think one reason dale has a great cadel has a great analysis of that by the way have you
heard cadel talk about this sorry for interrupting but he says like in here the hegel's phenomenology
hegel in the second part goes from uh reason to spirit to to religion to absolute spirit to absolute
knowledge and he says it's interesting because when the new atheists were there like that was reason
that was like you know dawkins there was a real they and so we will take dawkins as the paradigm of reason
um and then sam harris gets spiritual and so you see harris and dawkins arguing and they can't
understand each other and dawkins like what are you talking about so harris you know so out of new
atheism comes spirituality nobody saw that coming and then out of that then you see harris and peterson
talk and harris is like i don't understand what you're doing you know as this transition to religion
um and what the the transition that hasn't happened is to absolute knowledge right as i said but but i
thought whenever whenever cadel did an analysis from dawkins to harris to peterson i did go that
honestly was hard to see i try i like to try to think that i'm good at that kind of stuff but i
didn't think new atheism would the dark internet the dark web and all that uh would you know go into a
form of spirituality a la harris and then a form of union religiosity a la peterson uh very interesting
sorry anyway back to you no i mean this is important thank you peter that was a problem i
make i mean the the problem is of course the radicality of hegel for me athletes in my own
you know uh naive reading is that it's that leap to absolute knowing that's like that
because that's where you almost have this uh subjective institution right i mean you know
beautiful soul and then absolute knowing um so yeah uh now gentlemen this has been where i would put
shizek by the way because shizek debated peterson and peterson didn't know what she's i was doing so
like yeah i just thought shizek is the example of absolute knowledge and and when a person was
talking to shizek peterson had no idea yeah yeah yeah yeah uh in fact i remember in that debate uh
peterson even it was a bit patronizing i think asked why don't you what why do you call yourself a
marxist why not call yourself a chicken or have your own kind of philosophy um but yeah as as
as i was saying gentlemen thank you this has been lovely uh i've it's been fun i really uh you know
admire you both the way you're thinking and you know as i i'm a student of you both so this has
been truly a privilege for me no thank you and raul your podcast is incredible it's very uh humbling
for you to say that we had a part in your development because now i look at what you're doing and who
you're interviewing and i'm like whoa man you're doing it's incredible work so like yeah absolutely brilliant
to see me and i you know i was resistant to this conversation because i felt like i didn't know
enough about process to bring anything to the table but you pushed me i really enjoyed this
conversation and matt i've really enjoyed chatting with you i didn't realize you're in la i i i will
probably be back there at some point are you still in california or northern northern california
actually i'm up in uh san francisco oakland you know bay area oh right a bit further right than me
well i'm hoping to find myself living out in that part of the world again soon so if that happens
i'll enjoy chatting in person with you absolutely and you know hindsight's 2020 but i i think uh if we
ever do have another conversation we might actually start with shelling instead of whitehead because i feel
like um shelling's work is the seed for so much of tillick's work and um zizek's work and like we might
actually find more common ground so to speak a very important concept for shelling the difference
between ground and existence and in the nature of the divine and whatnot and the lack and the desire
in in the divine ground anyways that's something i'd love to to have a chance to speak with you with at
some point and maybe we can do it in person so let me know if you come out to california wonderful and
thanks raul this has been a real joy um uh to think more about what kind of joy exactly but uh
it's uh been been enriching and has left him with a lot a lot to ponder so yeah thank you both thank you
both bye bye
