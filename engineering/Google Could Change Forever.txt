This episode is brought to you by Ground News.
Hi, welcome to another episode of ColdFusion.
Google is everywhere.
The company is just a part of daily life.
When you want a quick answer to something,
you just use Google without a second thought.
But what if there was a world
where it wasn't just Google in that position,
but a whole host of other players?
That vision is what the Department of Justice
in the US wants to see.
Now, Google has suffered a major legal blow
after a US judge ruled it had acted illegally
to maintain a monopoly and stifle competition
while generating huge profits.
The US Attorney General described the ruling as,
quote, an historic win for the American people.
In August of 2024,
in an event called the biggest antitrust ruling of the century,
the DOJ has called Google a monopoly
in the online search market.
But since that ruling, things have progressed.
Now the DOJ are looking at ways to break up Google.
On September 6th, 2024,
a hearing was held to determine the plan forward.
But in yet further escalation,
the DOJ is launching another antitrust case
against Google in the coming days.
But in all of this,
there are still some questions here.
Is this the beginning of the end
for Google's era of online dominance?
Do the government's actions
actually help the average internet user?
Or is there a bit more to the story?
Might the Department of Justice
be a bit heavy-handed on Google?
We'll have a fair look at both sides.
Also stay tuned for the story of the Monopoly Man.
All of that and more, coming right up.
You are watching Confusion TV.
So it's well known that Google dominates online search.
They make up about 90% of the search market,
which has served them well.
Google makes over $175 billion yearly from search.
That's more than the GDP of countries like Kuwait,
Morocco, Slovakia and Oman.
But recently, this dominance has come into question.
In the landmark 286-page ruling
of Google versus the United States,
the DOJ thinks that Google has gotten to this position
due to unfair practices.
In other words, the violation of antitrust laws.
So it's probably good to have some definitions
before we go further.
According to the DOJ,
antitrust behavior is, quote,
anti-competitive conduct
that deprives American consumers,
taxpayers and workers
of the benefits of competition, end quote.
And part of this is a monopoly.
Monopoly status isn't legally defined
and it depends where you look.
But at 50% to 60% market share,
you're teetering on the edge
and such a company may endure scrutiny.
At 70% to 75%,
you're most definitely a monopoly.
But the thing is,
the triggering of antitrust action
also depends on the company's behavior.
But 90% market share
is definitely going to attract regulators
in any functioning government.
I read through some of the case document
and there's a lot,
but there's two main things I want to cover.
Google charging higher prices
because there's no competition
and paying to keep the competition away.
And remember that these are not my opinions,
just the facts from the case.
An interesting note in the paper
was that apparently in 2020,
Google conducted a study
to see what would happen to their bottom line
if it, quote,
were to significantly reduce
the quality of its search product,
end quote.
The conclusion was that
even if the company made search bad,
the revenue from search would still be fine.
On this, the judge wrote,
quote,
the fact that Google can make product changes
without concern that its users might go elsewhere
is something only a firm
with monopoly power could do.
Okay, so let's dig deeper.
The case cites that
since there's no other game in town
for search advertising,
advertisers had no choice
but Google
in order to reach more people.
Google could then increase prices.
The other problem,
according to the ruling,
was that prices were raised incrementally
to blend in with normal market fluctuations,
and this was to reduce
the likelihood of advertisers noticing.
Incremental price changes
led to consistent revenue growth
without significant complaints
from advertisers.
Google went as far as to do internal studies
to show that advertisers
did indeed not notice
and just thought that the price hikes
were just part of the overall market.
The DOJ also cites
that Google tuned their mechanism
for determining ad costs.
Quote,
Google adjusts the parameters
of the auction function,
how advertisers bid for ad space.
In order to improve long-term revenue,
this work has resulted in products
which add
several billion dollars
in incremental revenue annually.
End quote.
And this next point is pretty interesting.
The ruling goes on to say
that when Google grew concerned
about meeting its revenue targets,
a code yellow was called.
Basically,
it was an instruction
to get all hands on deck
to subtly raise advertiser pricing
without too many noticing.
The company knew they could do this,
yet again from more internal studies,
showing that advertisers
would pay more
than they currently were
without leaving.
The judge stated,
quote,
the trial evidence
firmly establishes
Google's monopoly power
and has enabled
Google to increase
text ad prices
without any meaningful
competitive constraint.
I know what some of you
would be saying.
Well,
who cares about advertisers
getting fleeced?
All advertisers do
is track you
and follow you around
on the off chance
that you'll buy something
that you've previously
been Googling.
And there is an argument
to be made there,
but there's a second order consequence.
If advertisers
have to pay higher costs
to Google,
they can then turn around
and pass some of that cost
onto you,
the consumer.
Google has been paying
Apple and Samsung
billions of dollars annually
to install Google
as the default search engine
on their smartphones
and web browsers.
Quote,
in return for exclusive
and non-exclusive
default placements,
Google pays Apple
$20 billion in 2022.
End quote.
This is apparently,
quote,
almost double the payment
Google made in 2020,
which at the time
was 17.5%
of Apple's operating profit.
So why would Google do this?
Well,
consumers tend to buy
more things on their phone
and for iPhones,
quote,
Google receives
almost 95%
of general search queries.
End quote.
And with billions
of iPhones out there,
that's a lot of ads,
which means a lot of revenue.
The DOJ
didn't like that.
Quote,
Google's distribution agreements
foreclose a substantial portion
of the general search services market
and impairs rivals' opportunities
to compete.
End quote.
The DOJ thinks
that it's actually the monopoly
on the phone browsing market
that enabled Google
to consistently raise
the prices of online advertising
without consequences,
as we discussed earlier.
It turns out
that back in the days
of Steve Jobs
and for a little bit after that,
Apple was looking
to make their own search engine.
But they had a search project
in the works
when Steve Jobs
was in charge over there.
They were looking at search
because he had such an axe
to grind with Eric Schmidt
because they launched Android
and he kicked Eric Schmidt
off the board
and there was a lot
of hand-wringing there.
I think Apple is,
and I've heard this
from folks around Apple,
I believe Apple's going to launch
their own search engine
and compete heads up
with Google.
But now,
Google has Apple
in golden handcuffs
with the $20 billion yearly deal.
In the contract,
Apple is basically
not allowed to innovate
on any of their own search engines.
The judge also scolds Google
for destroying and hiding evidence.
They allege
that Google trained employees
to not leave a paper trail
or, quote,
bad evidence behind.
Quote,
any company that puts the onus
on its employees
to identify
and preserve relevant evidence
does so at its own peril.
Google avoided sanctions
in this case.
It may not be so lucky
in the next one.
Entrepreneur and angel investor
David Friedberg
gives an interesting viewpoint.
In his view,
the ruling is more anti-success
than it is anti-consumer.
I'll also say
it just feels like
the tenor of all of this
is anti-success
and not anti-competition.
And anything that's
kind of successful or big
is automatically deemed
to be a monopoly.
And I think we really
have to kind of understand
how are consumers
and the market
for competition
being affected
by having all these
things together.
And that's what should
really be focused on
and studied,
not just the fact
that something is big
and successful.
Jason Kalakinis,
another angel investor,
states that Google
does not, in fact,
have a monopoly
on the ads business.
Meta, Amazon,
and TikTok
are also huge players.
They do have
a massive monopoly
in search.
That's absolutely true.
And the Justice Department,
I think,
is well within their rights
to take a deep dive on that.
They don't have it in ads.
If you look at the competition
for Google and advertising,
you got Meta, TikTok,
and Amazon,
which have very,
very significant
advertising businesses,
and then like a bunch
of new players,
which are referred to
basically as the shopping cart
networks.
That's Uber,
Instacart,
DoorDash,
et cetera.
And so when you look at this,
it really does rhyme
with what happened
with Microsoft.
They're two decades
late on this.
The search monopoly
has been squeezed
for every dollar
and to build
every subcomponent
of Google's monopoly.
At the time
of the antitrust ruling,
Google argued
that its distribution deals
are common
in the business world.
They equated paying
for search engine
default privileges
on phones
to be the same
as if a food manufacturer
pays to promote products
at eye level
in a grocery store aisle.
The way Google sees it,
if you don't like Google,
you can switch
the default engine
on your device.
But people don't switch,
says Google,
because they prefer Google.
Google has also stated
that they're going
to appeal the decision
of them being a monopoly.
On the flip side,
when it comes
to the default status
of Google on iPhones,
Apple themselves
aren't a fan of Bing.
Eddie Cue,
Apple's senior vice president,
said,
quote,
I don't believe
there's a price in the world
that Microsoft could offer us
to set Bing
as the default
in Safari over Google.
They offered to give us
Bing for free.
They could give us
the whole company,
end quote.
But also,
take that with a grain of salt,
because it might be
in Apple's best interest
to defend Google.
It's actually written
in that $20 billion contract
with Google.
Part of the contract
obligates both Google
and Apple
to defend this agreement,
quote,
in response
to regulatory actions,
i.e.
DOJ antitrust lawsuits,
just like this one.
OK,
so that's the ruling,
but it doesn't leave you satisfied.
What does this all mean
and what happens next?
And what about the calls
to break up Google?
Justice Department officials
are discussing their options,
including breaking up Google
so that their Chrome browser
could be sold
as a separate company.
Same with Google's
Android smartphone operating system.
Other options may include
even separating YouTube
from Google.
The Department of Justice
is considering breaking up Google
after winning an antitrust case
against the search giant
just last week.
A hearing is set
for early September.
You know,
maybe forcing Google
to divest
the Android operating system
and the Chrome browser.
Those are two of the suggestions
that we had heard
from people with knowledge
of this case.
Even if you don't actually
get a breakup,
it can divert resources,
talent, money,
capital towards fighting
these antitrust battles
and make a company
miss out on innovation
that led to, what,
a lost decade at Microsoft.
So that is the worry here
for Google as well.
But the idea of a breakup
has been raised
that the DOJ is going to
ask the judge to consider.
But there's a possibility
that Google could even
break itself up.
The last time something
similar happened
was back in 1982
when AT&T broke itself up
and this was to dispel
the antitrust pressure
from the government.
Google has the opportunity
to do something
really interesting here,
which is get ahead
of the curve
and break itself up
before the political system
forces that
onto it.
The big categories
would be search,
advertising, and YouTube.
And I think that would have
two big economic benefits
for shareholders.
One is you unlock value
by deconglomerating.
Second, once you break up
the company into these pieces,
there's less places
for employees
who aren't doing anything
to hide,
you know,
for all this bureaucracy
to hide.
I mean, look,
Google is famous
for employees
who don't do anything, right?
The guys sitting on the roof
sunning themselves all day.
If you break up the company
into three or four
smaller companies, right,
there's just way less
room for people to hide.
The DOJ could also
force Google
to make its advertising
knowledge available
to its rivals.
But the most likely scenario
is mandating
that Google abandon
the deals with Apple
that made its search engine
the default option
and the same goes
for the deal
with Android manufacturers too.
Law professor
Spencer Weber-Waller
agrees,
There are no fines
or monetary penalties
in these types of cases,
but the court
will have to decide
whether Google
should be broken up
in some way.
More likely,
it will order Google
to eliminate
the exclusive contracts,
exclusive contracts
and licensing restrictions
that have reinforced
its monopoly position
for years.
End quote.
Now to the latest updates.
On September 6,
2024,
in Washington,
a hearing was held
by the DOJ.
The result of the hearing
was that Google
was going to be given
an outline in December
as to what they should do
to restore competition
in the market.
The prosecution
hasn't finalized
the details of the recommendation,
but Justice Department
Attorney David Dalquist
said that it should be sweeping.
The recommendations
may include
what we just covered,
but interestingly,
the DOJ
is specifically looking
at the intersection
of artificial intelligence
and Google's plans.
During the hearing,
there was lots of talk
about Google's Gemini
and what else
Google had up their sleeve.
Meanwhile,
Google said that
they were concerned
that the DOJ
will hamstring their efforts
in the next generation
of search technology.
Google's attorney,
John Smedlein,
said at the hearing
that the company
requires an in-depth proposal
from the U.S. government prosecutors.
He said that they need
to know the details
as soon as possible.
Could also turn out
that Google could reach out
to Microsoft
and OpenAI
to come to their aid
in regards to convincing
the government
that AI search
isn't going to be
dominated by Google.
After this,
around next August,
there'll be another hearing
where the judge
will give his opinion.
In the meantime,
the Department of Justice
and Google
will begin the discovery process
to argue the respective cases.
And if all of that
isn't enough,
Google has even more
to worry about.
The company is under fire
at the moment.
A second case
by the DOJ
will be shining a critical light
on Google's online advertising
business specifically.
In the second trial,
the court will want to know,
does Google have a monopoly
in the online ad industry?
Did they achieve this monopoly
through anti-competitive behavior?
Google is heading back
to the courtroom next week.
The tech giant clashing
with the Department of Justice again.
Back in court again,
opening start on Monday.
And this is just on the heels
a month after Google
suffered this defeat
in another federal court.
But here's what this case is about.
It's really different
from the search case.
What the Department of Justice
in 17 states are saying
is that there are
three advertising technology markets
where Google is also
an illegal monopolist.
And mind you,
these markets are defined
by the DOJ.
And this is something
that the DOJ and the states
have to prove up.
They say these markets
are the networks
that Google owns
where advertisers buy space.
They say that Google
controls 80% of that market.
Also, the servers
that publishers use
to sell space
for advertisements.
DOJ says 91% ownership
by Google there.
And also the exchange
where the parties meet
to make these deals.
Google may have to fight
tooth and nail
to keep the status quo.
You all know Firefox, right?
The web browser.
Well, that's made
by a company called Mozilla.
The weird thing is
that over 83% of Mozilla's revenue
is made up from Google payments.
The total number of Firefox users
continues to plummet.
And yet,
Google keeps paying them.
That sounds a bit weird,
you might be asking.
Why would Google pay
to keep their competitor alive?
The payment started back in 2005
when Google liked
what the guys at Mozilla
were doing with Firefox.
But now,
critics state
that Mozilla keeps Firefox
on live support
just so that Google can say
that the Chrome browser
doesn't have a monopoly
in the world of web browsers.
If the DOJ orders Google
to stop their deals
with other parties,
Mozilla could end up losing
83% of their revenue overnight.
Interestingly,
this ruling draws
from a 25-year-old
antitrust case with Microsoft.
As per CNBC,
quote,
a federal judge
determined in 1999
that Microsoft
had illegally used
the market power
of its Windows operating system
to box out rival browsers,
namely Netscape Navigator.
A settlement in 2001
forced the software giant
to stop disadvantaging competitors
in its PC deals,
end quote.
After the legal trouble,
Microsoft would take a step back
from the emerging internet industry,
creating room for new startups,
like Google,
to thrive.
So this ruling
isn't the end of Google overnight.
It's just the door
to open a pathway
for a reduction
in their dominance.
Foundationally,
antitrust regulation
is underpinned
by the idea
that competition
is good for everyone.
The market,
the companies themselves,
but especially
for the average consumer.
The argument is,
if Google has no competition,
there's a possibility
that they could just
stop caring altogether.
There's already online murmurs
that Google search
is indeed getting worse,
from the search relevancy dropping
to SEO keyword stuffing
polluting results
to too many ads
and poor generative AI implementation.
There's a point to be made
that all of this legal scrutiny
could at the very least
keep Google on their toes
to improve their user experience.
But regardless,
this legal trouble for Google
is the biggest in decades.
Notre Dame Law School professor
Roger Alford,
who served in the DOJ's
antitrust division,
has the defining comment
on the matter.
Quote,
Not since Microsoft lost
in the 1990s
have we seen a case
of this magnitude.
As for the future,
if and when
Google is forced
to let go of its
exclusivity contracts,
at first,
it's not going to be
that exciting.
For Android and iPhone users,
if they prefer Google
on their phones,
they'll stick with it.
Though,
it would open the door up
for things to be shaken up.
For example,
Apple would now be free
to create their own search engine.
Newer players like Perplexity
could gain a foothold.
Who knows?
So I'll ask you as a viewer,
what are your thoughts
on the US government
going after Google like this?
Opinions are really split here.
Some say Google
deserves to be broken up.
Others say that Google
is the best product out there,
so no wonder they dominate.
Others still think that
America should avoid
turning into the EU
regulating innovation
into oblivion.
Others like Chamath
think that Google
is actually a great company
overall because they're
in a unique position
to innovate.
A point pretty much counter
to what the government
is arguing here.
The breaking up of Google
is great for competition
and for startups.
But let's not forget,
Google is an incredible company
that has created
enormous amounts of good.
They have done
way more good than bad.
Way more.
Like three, four, five
orders of magnitude
more good than bad.
And to break a company
like that,
I think would be
a really bad outcome.
I want to just underline
what Chamath said real quick.
Being big
can be very good
in the sense
that it can drive
an ability
to invest in innovation
that is not possible
without the scale
and the significant cash flow
that's being generated
by being that big.
For those of you
who stuck around,
let me show you something.
Here's a classic troll move
for some comic relief.
A man dressed as
Mr. Moneybags himself
was repeatedly pictured
terrorising Google.
The images surfaced online
during multiple Google hearings
in 2017 and 2018.
The Monopoly man in question
is Ian Madrigal.
The aim of his stunt
was to draw attention
to the need for antitrust action
against Google.
And now,
it seems like he finally
got his wish.
Digesting the news today
is more complicated
than ever to make sense of.
That's exactly where
today's sponsor,
Ground News, comes in.
Ground News is a website
and app developed
by a former NASA engineer.
She was determined
to give readers
an easy, data-driven,
objective way
to read the news.
Using this story
of Yelp suing Google
as an example,
their biased distribution chart
shows me the political leanings
of the news outlets
and I can get a summary
of how the issues
are being framed.
The left focuses
on Google rigging the results
in their favour,
disadvantaging players
like Yelp.
They also give more weight
to Yelp's CEO
who states that Google
has an ecosystem of control.
Meanwhile,
the right underscores
the broader implications
and states Google's
counter-arguments,
highlighting past FTC dismissals
and pending appeals.
Scrolling down,
I can compare
every single article
on the topic
with convenient tags
showing me context
about the source,
like how factual it is
and who owns it.
I also love
their blind spot feed.
This shows you stories
that are underreported
by one side
of the political spectrum.
For example,
if you're on the left,
you probably missed
the story of Amazon Electors
refusing to give reasons
as to why users
should vote for Trump,
but doing so
when asked for reasons
to vote for Kamala Harris.
