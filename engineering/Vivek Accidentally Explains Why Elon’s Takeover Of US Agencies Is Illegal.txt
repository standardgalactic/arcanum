there are multiple stories that i think taken as a whole we have to understand as being an attack
on the administrative state this is something that we've been harping on for well really years since
steve bannon got up in front of cpac in february of 2017 and claimed that was what the
administration was all about this time around they have really figured out and have a plan on
how they're going to do it the difference is is that elon musk who paid at least one quarter of a
billion dollars for donald trump to become president has run of the place i don't know that he's doing
it for the same ideological reasons that steve bannon is he's doing it ultimately to benefit
himself in a myriad of ways which could range from getting proprietary secrets on businesses getting
the u.s business of cutting checks it could also just be like you know elon musk has a lot of
interests in china and there may be value to him to undermine uh certain u.s operations and functions
frankly it's unclear but the bottom line is is there are multiple stories differing stories that all end
up on the basically in the same place which is to undermine the administrative state to make our
government function worse for its people and um to see if you can find that ap from today also bradley
i want to play this but if you can find that ap uh that i mentioned today because the way that this
story and we're going to be talking to nathan about what's going on with the payment system which is
the scariest of all of them i think but there is no way that elon musk and doge whatever status it has
now has the authority to shut down an agency completely unilaterally without any type of legislative
uh action and you know we had this conversation the other day with ellie mistel the irony of
the demise of the chevron doctrine chevron deference doctrine which says the courts will defer to
agencies when it comes to questions on how to interpret or build upon a broad directive from congress
and now the courts are saying no we will uh we will step in and decide if congress hasn't
been explicit is completely um at odds with the idea that the executive agencies have the ability to
shut themselves down uh which is of course in uh contradictory to what congress has has called for
so we're gonna see how this plays out if it ultimately gets to the courts um we should tell
you right up front that in an interview in the hill i think it was or no semaphore uh chuck schumer
said their strategy is to just do nothing and watch and let them hang themselves by their own petard
um i mean that's literally what the uk labor did under boris johnson the previous years we will
explain why this is a horrible strategy all right but here is a uh x you know audio space whatever
they call it with two sitting u.s senators mike lee and joni ernst and vivek ramaswamy the uh
what was it that he made all his money on it was like some type of charlatan scheme i can't remember
exactly what it was alzheimer's drug oh yeah yeah a drug that never really made it big but there was
a big stock from his mom it was a big pump and dump type of situation um and uh elon musk
who is uh you know the i don't know what his title is uh oligarchic czar of the oligarchs i'm not sure
what it is caesar oligarch czar and then two sort of like apparently completely inconsequential u.s senators
here's joni arts is going to start this off because so much of that taxpayer money is not
even going to you know we love to feel good about helping starving children and name your country
sit down but it's not going there it's going to it's going to pay rents in paris yes it's going to
support somebody's fancy dinner to entertain whoever positive they're talking about usa id and
i look it may be the case that none of that money goes to helping starving children of course that's
not the case but let's just um and it may be the case that it's all going to fancy dinners in paris
if only joni ernst could find someone who is maybe a senator one of a hundred most powerful people in
the country who is in the um majority in the senate and could hold a hearing on it and shut the whole
thing down but apparently she doesn't know who to ask about that go ahead for somebody's fancy dinner to
entertain whoever yeah exactly so to be clear in shutting down um which we're in the process of
doing shutting down usa id the the the reason for that as opposed to simply um you know trying to do
do some minor house cleaning is is that as we dug into usa usa id it became apparent that what we have
here is is not an apple with a worm in it but we have actually just a ball of worms um and so at the
the point which you you don't really like if you've got an apple that's got a worm in it maybe you can
take the worm out but if you've got actually just a ball of worms it it's hopeless um and usid is a
ball of worms there is no apple um and when there is no apple that's this you've just got to basically
get rid of the whole thing that is why it's gotta go you know it's it's it's beyond it's beyond repair
um so yeah there's a solution to this which is that let's say something's got that the people
of this country just demand pause it now wait a second this is vivek ramaswamy
and uh he says you know there he's gonna he's gonna go on to talk about the solution on how
the american public can get it back but there is absolutely zero authority
for the president of the united states and certainly his uh top oligarch to just unilaterally
decide they're gonna cut an agency all of the authority if you can believe it actually lies in
people like joni arts and mike lee on this call based upon something called the constitution
constitution and uh here's a vivek ramaswamy's idea on how we can get this back if but it's just so
blinkered that you can he he doesn't realize that he's actually um talking about why what musk is doing
is thoroughly illegal but let's say something's got that the people of this country just demand
needs to exist again it can always be voted back into existence by uh senator ernst and her colleagues
totally the fact that that isn't going to happen exactly exactly why many of these agencies
really deletion is the only answer that's left well yes okay pause it right there now why would you
need joni ernst and mike lee to vote it back in is it because the authority to create agencies does not
lie with the president why couldn't the president just reinstate it why couldn't elon musk decide
that we're going to have a new agency for the exact same reason why it's illicit for them to cut it
he's going i triple dog dare you joni ernst up for re-election in 2026 to go against my authority
if the will of the american people is that we need more us aid back well joni earns she can just vote for
it but i've got a cool you know few dozen mil that can just pour right into her race as she's on this
call with me that would preclude her from doing that this is not certainly why she voted for pete
hegseth and that's why she's on that call right now but the point is is that if you need the authority
of the u.s senate to create an agency you need the the authority of the u.s senate
to dissolve that agency exactly and um i guess we'll see if uh somebody brings a legal challenge
it seems to me like i i i we congress would have the standing i don't know but don't worry chuck schumer
is on the case and wait do you have that ap thing you didn't find it okay so i'm listening to ap this
morning yeah i did is it the eight let's yes i think it's this one yeah
there's going to be a commercial ap news good morning i'm ed donaghy a us aid agency is on the
cusp of being shut down the ap's julie walker has the story the u.s agency for international development
usa id which is in charge of dispensing billions of dollars in foreign aid is on the cusp of being
shut down according to president trump's advisor elon musk asked about it what what no wait keep
playing this because because here's the point why what schumer is doing is so stupid and ineffective
back to the white house sunday trump weighed in usaid run by radical lunatics and we're getting them
out and then we'll make a decision musk has been wrestling for control of usaid and took to x spaces
to discuss it to be clear in shutting down um which we're in the process during shutting down usaid
the trump administration placed two top usaid security chiefs on leave after they refused to
turn over classified material to musk's doge government inspection teams which did eventually get
control i'm julie walker tomorrow okay so there it is absolutely no sense of what they're doing is
completely illicit no sense of this is unprecedented and where's the democrat who's going to come out
and say hey this is completely unprecedented and illicit i mean no because chuck schumer's decided
the best way to do this is to let them they're gonna screw up hakeem jeffries this came out this
morning is going to use this in their negotiations on the budget as opposed to raising the alarms
because he's going to make a demand that this freeze stop but that's a few months down the line
here buddy we're in a five alarm fire like there's a lot of i saw aoc made this this thing where she
called it a plutocratic coup um i guess it was probably in reference to the treasury but it still
is the overall same dynamic where it's the the richest man on the planet is being given access
without congressional oversight to our most sensitive government uh functioning and taking a hatchet to it
because it's this like idea that they can create a series of shocks this is the shock doctrine in
practice so that these plutocrats can uh cre just create these like mass austerity measures and cut
cut cut cut cut and then in the wreckage they can rebuild this government in their image and take as
many of the spoils as they want that's the agenda and it's also mixed it so it's the tech agenda and
this curtis yarvin monarch monarchical might makes right democracy is outdated vision that's kind of this
frankenstein that we have here why have congress at all well that's what they're trying to vote on
anything it's the supreme court empowering itself with the chevron doctrine um or doing away with it
so that they have complete control over what should be the agency authority on that end and then on the
presidential end they have given trump broad powers uh with his like presidential immunity for official
blacks and he's testing it again where they're probably going to try to take the impoundment
control thing to the supreme court this is both like a two-pronged diminishment of congressional power
they've already self-diminished it with like frankly the senate and the filibuster and everything
right but they're even diminishing it more the courts are with the help of the conservative apparatus
so it's more power to the executive and more power to these right-wing judges and the idea that the
democrats are sitting on the sideline and not creating a political narrative about this when
you have the ap running to normies essentially like this is oh here i mean it comes off as like
elon musk is just going in there and rooting out inefficiencies just like you know one would hope
i heard more outrage from these institutions over the idea that someone would overrule the parliamentarian
what happened to all of this this care about our procedures and processes it's completely insane
