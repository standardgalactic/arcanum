Hi, welcome to Ayurubah Speaks Literally, the podcast where I share the random things
and the random thoughts that shape my personality.
Today's random thoughts, well, it is mental health.
Mental health is a topic that touches all of us in some way.
And so I'm excited to have two incredible guests with us, each bringing a unique perspective
into this very important conversation.
First, we have Vanessa Van Der Pooy, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology based in the UK.
And we have Mame Adra Eja, who is a behavior, I'm trying to make sure that I say this word
correctly, a behavioral, behavioral, a behavioral health technician in the US and a master's
student in health psychology, or I believe she's completed her master's by now, or she's
about to complete her master's in psychology.
So in this episode, we're going to talk about their journeys, compare the differences in
mental health care in the UK and the US.
And seeing as we're all Ghanians, we're also going to talk about Ghana's mental health
approach as well.
And then we'll dive into what the future holds for psychology and mental health.
For me, I'm going to have, I'm going to ask questions about technology as well, because,
well, I'm a technology law graduate.
And, and so just going to ask how technology also, um, mends itself, mends itself, combines
itself with mental health, um, treatment in our world today.
So whether you're curious about pursuing a career in this field, passionate about improving
mental health care, or simply looking for insights into how we can better support ourselves and
others, this is a conversation for you, and I hope you enjoy it.
So grab a cup of coffee, cause it's chilly over here.
If it's hot, grab a hot, a cold soda, and let's dive into the conversation.
My name is Aiyue Boa.
Well, damn.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
So glad you tuned in.
Let's get to talking.
Na, na, na, na.
Aiyue Boa speaks.
Literally.
Yeah, she's speaking literally.
Bad things slightly trary.
Whether happy, scary, or teary.
She'll have you feeling very merry.
She's about to count.
Na, na, na, na.
Hi, guys.
Welcome to the episode.
Like I mentioned earlier in the intro, we're going to be talking about mental health, which
is a very important conversation.
And to help me with this conversation, are two very important ladies, Vanessa and Mamiadra.
Welcome, ladies.
Thank you for joining me on Aiyue Boa Speaks.
Thank you for having us.
Yeah, thank you.
Okay, so before we start the conversation, just give us a little, you know, intro.
Who is Vanessa?
Who is Mamiadra?
Tell the listeners so that they can learn more about you.
So I'll start with Vanessa.
Okay.
Well, my name is Vanessa.
I went to secondary school, so high school with Irama.
I moved to the UK after high school.
And ever since I've been in the UK, I've been studying psychology.
So it's been about 10 years now of studying psychology.
I'm currently doing my doctorate, my clinical doctorate in clinical psychology to become
a registered clinical psychologist in the UK.
I'm already a clinical associate psychologist, which is like the equivalent of physician assistant.
I'm a psychologist.
So I'm already qualified as that, but I'm upgrading now to become a proper clinical psychologist.
So it's a three-year program, and I'm currently in my second year.
Well done.
Well done.
Thank you, Vanessa.
Mami?
Hi, my name is Mami.
Sometimes I go by Mami in the US only, though.
But I'm Irama's cousin on my mom's side, and I'm currently in my master's program, where
I'm on the health track.
So I'm finishing up on my thesis, and then after that, I'm trying to find a job before
I get into my doctorate degree.
Well done, Mami.
In case you guys didn't know, I am Ayuribua.
And I'm going to have this conversation with these two lovely ladies.
So thank you again for joining me.
So let's get into the conversation.
Hold on.
Let me let me gather my questions now.
Okay.
So my first question is, like you guys said, you've mentioned that you're you're pursuing
either already started pursuing a career in psychology or you you are still in the process
of it.
So the first thing is, what inspired you to pursue that career in psychology and mental
health?
Mami, let's start with you.
Okay.
Um, well, while I was in undergrad, I was originally a math major.
Well, actuarial science to be accurate with it.
But I switched into psychology because I wasn't entirely enjoying the math curriculum.
So while I started taking psychology, that's where I started learning more about it, especially
with health psychology.
So from there, that's where I wanted to pursue a career where I can help others with their
health behaviors.
I think I decided to do psychology in secondary school, actually, because I remember on one
of the, I think it was a university fair or something.
Some, there was a university from, from, in the UK, um, shared like leaflets or pamphlets.
Yeah.
I remember those days.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So like, because I really, I was studying visual arts.
I really, you know, I thought I'm going to be a graphic designer and that's it.
Um, but then I came across psychology and then the summary for the course was that it's
about helping people.
So I thought, oh, okay, that's what I'm going to do.
So I came to the UK and decided I was going to do psychology and, um, yeah, it's, you know,
I, I, I guess my decision to, to pursue psychology was a very long journey and my decision to still
stick with it was also out of, um, lived experience of mental health disabilities and my own personal
experiences and wanting to, to be of value to people who have been through things.
that I have also been through.
Okay.
Thank you.
Um, so now let's, let's look at it right now.
We are away from home basically, let's say, but coming from where we are, um, obviously as
years have gone by, we can, we can say that the conversation of mental health has become
a thing and people actually, um, you know, appreciate it a lot more than they did.
Let's say even 10 years ago when we were in high school.
So, um, what do you think is the most important thing to, um, to say when it comes to conversations
where they say, you know what, this mental health thing, um, you are just making it a big deal.
It's not too much of a big deal.
Just pray about it.
You know, just forget, forget your worries.
Just do this.
Just do that.
You'll be okay.
You'll be fine.
What do you think is the most important thing to say when, when people say that?
Who wants to go first?
I can say that.
But that's like a, okay, Bami can go.
Oh.
I feel it's just important to let them know mental health is just as important as physical
health.
As like, you know, you see what people who go through depression, anxiety, even stress,
right?
Like we all go through that with school work.
It's important to like, you know, remind, especially maybe those who are against mental
health, that when you have it sorted or even learn ways to like, um, improve on it, it really
changes your outlook in life and also how you are able to like, you know, function as a human
being.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I agree with you, Mame.
Um, really mental health is also health is it's, it's, it's, you know, it's an aspect of
health.
So there's physical health, which people think is what health is.
And health isn't physical health.
There's also mental health.
There's emotional health.
Um, there is spiritual health.
So health is very valid, uh, sorry, very, um, but I guess I understand why people saying,
you know, um, mental health is, um, mental health is, um, almost as if it's, it's a luxury,
you know, it's like, well, at least from where I'm coming from, it's often viewed as if it's
a luxury.
And I understand that because in some, in some ways it is a luxury, you know, you have to pay
for, you know, psychologists and it's not, it costs a lot of money, you know, so part
of changing people's minds is also perhaps looking at systems that have made mental health
feel like a luxury rather than just right, that people have the right to mental health
care.
Um, and I think it, that much of the advocacy has to come from, from top to bottom.
So looking at people who are in charge of systems, healthcare systems, policies, laws,
whatever it is, that is where the work has to start from.
But then there's also the individual work that we all have to do, regardless of our financial
situation, regardless of our circumstances.
At the end of the day, it is your health and it is your responsibility.
Um, so perhaps you can, what you have to do is to first of all, deconstruct the idea
that health, mental health is a luxury or that mental health is separate from health because
it's really part of health.
And, and when you can start, start to sort of understand it in that way, you can try to
find ways in the system to, to support you with your mental health.
Yeah.
Yeah, well said.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I agree with that.
And yeah, um, would you say that your academic path or your professional path has helped to
has helped shape your perspective on what mental care, mental health care is, is that a big
um, factor?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I like the unison.
Okay.
Well, I'll go.
Um, yeah, no, I agree.
I think it's taken me years to, um, really sort of even, um, understand mental health within
the African or Ghanaian context.
It's taken me a lot of time to understand that it's not a luxury, that it's not a rich people's
problem.
You know, it's taken me a lot of time and certainly education has helped me tremendously because
now I don't just, I don't just situate the problem within the person.
I look at the systems around them.
Um, and so, you know, in the past I would have said, well, it's all on you.
If you're not taking care of your mental health, it's all on you, but how can it be all on them
when they are in system in place to help them with funding, to help them with medication, to help
them with seeing a psychologist with, you know, it's, it's all of these systems.
So it's really about helping people to see that I understand, I understand where you're
coming from and why you think it's such a luxury or it's so difficult to get mental health care.
But let's think about what we can do with what we have while we, we, we, we try to push
people in higher systems or levels of, of authority to change the system.
But until then, let's sort of work with what is, it's the approach I use now.
Yeah.
Um, Mami, what about you?
Yeah, yeah, going off Vanessa's point about like accessibility, what people see or perceive
about mental health, um, I was able to learn about different like techniques while I was
in school.
And if I didn't have that experience, I feel I would have not been able to like, you know,
have that knowledge.
And it just reminds me of people who don't like, you know, have that accessibility to,
you know, the vast knowledge on stress management techniques and other ways that
to, um, you know, help with, um, mediating any kind of like depressive or negative emotions.
So like one big thing I like is, um, mindfulness or meditating.
Like that might seem as something far fetched depending on your culture, but it really does
help just to sit down for a second.
Like, and you can even pray if you're somebody who's religious.
So, um, yeah, just the knowledge is, um, one way to like help with that.
Okay.
Thank you both for that as well.
Um, so now my next question is what do you think about the differences in the approach in
the study of mental health, you, Vanessa, you're in the UK, mama, you're in the U S how does
the, um, approach also, how is the approach, um, important in understanding mental health?
Do you think that there's a real difference?
Are you, do you mean sort of differences in the way the country's approach?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Well, I'm not familiar with the American system, but I know that to become a clinical psychologist,
um, it's, it's a very competitive process because it's funded by the NHS.
So it's funded by our healthcare system.
So they pay for your tuition and then you're paid a salary because you, you, you, you do
have to work while studying.
So it's a lot of juggle.
Um, but because it's paid for, it's very, very competitive.
Um, I, I remember you said you wanted to do health psychology.
That one is not funded, unfortunately.
So it's only clinical psychology that's in the UK, but forensic psychology, educational
psychology, health psychology is not funded.
Um, so because of that, it's very competitive in the UK.
If you want to train as a clinical psychologist specifically, and because it's very competitive,
you have to sort of accumulate a lot of work experience.
You have to have done a master's.
So for instance, I had two masters because I, you know, that's all the work I had to do
to be able to get a space on a very competitive program.
Um, and then when you're from a minority, it's even more difficult.
Your journey is longer, you know?
So, um, because yeah, I can say a lot about that, but anyway, let me stop myself.
But, um, yeah, so, uh, and so because of that, um, we have lots of clinical psychologists who
are very competitive in nature, who are very perfect, you know, come from a very perfectionist
approach.
Um, and, um, the thing about the way we study clinical psychology here is that we're not
restricted to one model or one, um, um, type of therapy.
So we, we have different types of therapy, we have CBT, we have EMT, we have DBT, we have
CAT, we have, so there are different types.
The difference between a clinical therapy-
Rizuma, you said so many things that I don't know if you could explain those things.
So basically, what I said was like, you know, there are different therapies in that there
are, what I mean is, depending on which therapy you go for, um, it, it would affect the approach
in which they treat you because every therapy has a way of understanding mental health.
So for example, CBT thinks that the way to alleviate mental difficulties is to think about
or focus on the way the person thinks about the problem, how it commits to the way to behave,
and then their feelings.
So it's, it's that sort of thoughts, behavior, feelings, so that's, that always approaches
mental health.
Whereas for example, um, cognitive analytic therapy approaches mental health in terms of
looking at the way people relate with themselves and one another.
So the whole, that it's philosophy is that to alleviate mental health distress, you have
to first go into the person's childhood, you know, what were their childhood, um, how did
that relationship affect the way they came to understand themselves?
And then as a result of that, how they relate with other people and understand other people.
So depending on the type of therapist that you see and that, that their type of, the type
of training that you've got, which specific therapy you've trained in, it will affect the
way they view the problem that you come to them with.
And I think that's one of my issues is that a lot of therapists don't disclose which particular
therapy they've trained in.
They just say, I'm a therapist without providing information about, are you a CBT therapist?
Are you a, because the, the, the, the patient or the client needs to know that this is the
type of therapy that the therapist is trained in and then decide, is this kind of thinking
about mental health?
Is this the way I want to think about my difficulties or fair, a different type of therapy?
Doesn't make sense.
So the difference between a psychotherapist and a clinical psychologist or a psychologist
is that a psychologist has training different types of therapies.
Okay.
Whereas a psychotherapist has a training in one particular type of therapy.
Okay.
That's the difference.
So most people confuse the two.
That was the difference between a therapist and a psychologist.
So a psychologist knows more about a lot of therapies, whereas a therapist or a psychotherapist
has just focused on one type of therapy.
One thing.
Okay.
Okay.
So it's true that your, your academic, uh, details has really, you know, put you in a,
a more clear view of what mental health is.
Yeah.
Mame, Mame, were you going to say something?
Yeah.
Um, sorry.
I was listening to the question, the question, you forgot to the question.
I was, I think the question was about, um, how studying.
How studying in the U S um, you know, the pathway in the U S is.
Yes.
So, um, I joined in psychology, my junior year of undergrad, and then I just went into masters.
So I have more like knowledge of like what's required there.
Um, they, um, expect you to finish a thesis and, um, with your courses, like they want
you to apply theories and models, um, towards like real world, real world applications.
So you, um, so then beginning you start learning about different models.
Um, one big model we learned is the health belief model, theory of plan behaviors, just
all these different, yeah, theories and models.
Um, and I haven't started my PhD by was like, um, researching about it.
Um, researching about it.
I know in the U S it takes five to seven years, depending on which program you choose.
And they focus more on like conducting large longitudinal, uh, longitudinal, um, research.
So like, um, basically research that is going to take over, um, two years or just a long period
of time.
Uh, that's why I wanted to take a break before I went into PhD program.
Cause yeah, here in the U S, um, going off Vanessa saying that they want them to work.
I think some programs like why you just to dedicate your whole time to finishing, um, your, the PhD
degree.
So I know some students have like, um, conflicts with that, especially with financial, um, with
their finances.
Um, uh, and I think in the U S there's been more, um, resources to like, um, towards mental
health, um, especially in like, I can speak on campus for, um, students, especially, um,
with, um, like community health clinics.
And also there's a lot of like, um, sorry, it's a specific name for it, but like basically
a mental, um, health counselor services, like they have different ones, um, pertaining
to what students need.
So like, there's a lot of athletes on campus.
They give them mental health, um, services.
They give people services for depression, um, anxiety.
Yeah.
It's just like abundance of it.
So that's just, I guess what I can speak for the U S side of, um, psychology.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
So, um, now I want to understand these, I want to understand emotions.
Let's, let's bring emotions out.
What exactly does, you know, the study of psychology or mental health tell you about, you know, anxiety,
depression, hope, sadness, happiness, all those emotions.
What exactly does the study tell you about it?
When a person is feeling all these emotions, whether at one particular time or the same
things altogether.
Um, I don't know if my question is helping is, but yeah, I can try to answer you.
Let me know if I'm going way off, but I wouldn't know.
Cool.
So, um, in the health, in the health psychology track, they focus on the biosocial social.
Oh, I can't even say it.
Biosocial.
Biopsychosocial.
Yeah.
Biopsychosocial model.
It's like a tongue twister, but yeah.
And it focuses on, um, physical and mental health with consideration of social and psychological
factors.
So I believe like, um, looking at that, it helps to understand people on a different level
as to why they, or their, um, interpretation of their behaviors towards like health.
Um, so like one big thing that like we learned in school with social factors is finance, um,
where people live at, like their, um, their location or their availability towards, um, certain health services, people's knowledge.
That's also another thing to, um, to consider because some, someone might not know what insurance,
um, plan can cut, um, how it can be useful for them since they don't have like the knowledge
of it.
So I like that aspect of it.
Cause you always just think it's, oh, like if you're doing something that's like not good
for you, that's the reason why, like, you know, you're having a low quality of life where
it's like stuff you can't control like money and all that, that can influence your overall
health.
So money is the root of all happiness.
Maybe no, there's other things to like, you know, that can help your mental health that's
outside of finance, but that can be a big barrier for people.
So that's yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
And just to add to that, I think, you know, in, in America, there's a insurance system,
which we don't have in the UK cause healthcare.
Oh yeah.
You guys got that good for us.
The biggest barrier to healthcare is long waiting list.
Like you, you're just going to be waiting for a long time.
It's free, but it's not as quick.
I had that experience today.
Oh, it's not as quick, but just to go back to your question.
I noticed that you, you, you said, you know, depression, anxiety, hope, sadness.
And I was thinking, were you sort of thinking that depression and anxiety were emotions?
Yes, I, I, I, I believe that.
Yes.
Well, no, they're not.
They're not?
No.
Yeah.
This is part, you know, I do a lot of work with the faith community and I love my Christians.
I love my religious people, but sometimes like when I listen to them speak about, you
know, depression and anxiety, and they say things like, you know, as you are just deciding
to be depressed and, you know, God has given you sadness and, you know, it's, there are
two very different things.
I, I really get upset when people mean sadness and then they say it's depression because the
two are not the same.
Sadness and depression are not the same thing.
One is.
Don't they blend in though?
No.
If you have depression, that's like a whole different thing than being sad.
There are different types of depression.
So depression is a, is a medical condition.
It's not a, it's not an adjective.
It's not a, a synony or another name for depression, for sadness.
Sorry.
It's a proper mental health condition that is diagnosable.
So you have to be diagnosed in order to, to say you have depression.
You have to, you have to be experienced a constant decrease in low mood every single
day for two weeks.
So it's not like I'm sad today.
I get money.
I'm happy.
No, that's not depression.
Depression is even when the good things come in your life, even when everything is available
to you, even when things are going well, you just can't seem to lift yourself.
Like your, your mood is just constantly so low.
Every single minute of the day, every single day for two weeks.
So if by week three, you are fine.
That's not depression.
If by, if by day three, you're fine.
That's not depression.
If by day seven, you're fine.
That's not depression.
It has to be constant for two weeks.
See, so you see how that differs significantly for depression.
Significantly for sadness.
It's not the same thing.
And that different types of depression, different symptoms of depression.
It's depression that can look nothing like what, like sadness.
Some people are depressed and they're just hyper.
Yeah.
They're impulsive.
There's hypersexuality, drinking, alcohol, and it's a form of depression.
But if we always say that depression is sadness, going to be missing out a lot of people whose
depression doesn't look like what we think it is.
You know, it's very important that we get that right.
We, we, we understand the words we're using.
And if we want to sort of advocate for, for, for mental health awareness, anxiety, the same
way, it's not the same as worry.
Anxiety is so and worry.
There are different types of anxiety.
So many times it's very, you have to be diagnosed with it.
You have to see just, there's a strict criteria in order to be diagnosed with anxiety.
There's social anxiety.
There's generalized anxiety disorder.
OCD is a form of anxiety.
There are different types of anxiety.
So it's not the same thing that I'm just worried all the time, or I'm having a panic
attack or it's panic attack is a different disorder on its own, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that, um, I just wanted to use that opportunity to
like, make it clear that those are not emotions.
Yeah.
Those are medical conditions.
Okay.
Yeah.
But on the topic of, of emotions, um, I really like what you said about the bio-social
model because we need to understand that medical conditions are not just an issue of emotions.
Medical conditions are as a result of your biology, your psychology and your social factors
interacted.
So you, you first need to have a biological predisposition.
Okay.
So that is the difference between break, break it down for me or break it down for me.
Yeah.
I just wanted to sound like a teacher.
No, no, no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Teachers, please.
Your biological predisposition means that for example, in your family, there's a, there's
a, um, a history of like, let's say bipolar disorder, you know, it means that you have
the biological predisposition likelihood that you also get bipolar, but then having the biological
predisposition, it doesn't necessarily mean that you automatically get it.
Mm-hmm.
It is when your psychology and your social factors are so bad.
And that's what triggers the biological predisposition.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't make sense.
Yeah.
So now, two people can go through the same thing and one will have a mental disorder and
the other person wouldn't.
It's not because the person who gets it is weak and doesn't believe in God.
And it's not because of that.
It's, it's because perhaps there was a biological predisposition.
Their social situation was not helpful.
Their psychological situation was not helpful.
And that brought about the full blown disorder.
Mm-hmm.
You know, doesn't it?
Okay.
Yeah.
So that's where situations, sort of emotions sit.
Mm-hmm.
They sit in a biological, psychological and social, like interaction, if it makes sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Actually, Vanessa, that reminds me of when I took a psychopathology course.
Mm-hmm.
We were talking about, like, how social factors or like environmental factors can trigger people's,
like, people's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, like in later years.
Yes.
And, like, you explaining it helped me to understand it more.
Oh, that's amazing.
That's just so funny.
And that's why sometimes-
Mama, you're welcome.
Thank you, Rama, yes.
And that's why sometimes people can develop mental health difficulties later in life.
Mm-hmm.
And they're like, where did this come from?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Because then it's just that the situation wasn't as bad enough to trigger it.
Mm-hmm.
Let's say people, I remember there was a time where there was a lot of university students
dying by suicide.
Mm-hmm.
And then the story was always, oh, they had a broken heart and so they killed themselves.
No.
It's most likely that there was a genetic predisposition.
Mm-hmm.
The broken heart was just the situation to trigger that, that, that biological predisposition.
Mm-hmm.
You know, so it was always there.
There was always a, and that's why, you know, there's this whole, like, don't take drugs,
because you can end up, if you have a biological predisposition-
To trigger it.
To trigger it.
It can trigger, yes.
There are someone who doesn't have the biological predisposition, you take the drugs and they'll
be fine.
And you'll be thinking, oh, me too, I can take it.
Mm-hmm.
And they were fine.
But then you take it and then-
No.
Yep.
And then, and then they'll say it's fearful.
Exactly.
Okay.
Mommy fearful is like house people, house witches, quote unquote.
Oh yeah.
Uh-uh.
Okay.
So I now understand that.
Yeah.
Depression, anxiety, they are not emotions.
And the emotions, basically, they might, they might come out or they might show themselves
in our bio social social yes i got it i got it so let me give let me give an example now
of a time where um me i felt sad when my when my um environment changed so moving from ghana to the
uk and i'm sure you have heard a lot of things that um when people move here and they move here
alone they don't have family here it can get very lonely so there might be days that oh i've closed
from lectures and i come back to my room and i'm sharing a house with strangers so i can't even go
out and start chatting with them so i'm alone in my room and so there's a feeling of every time
after school i'm sad i'm lonely the weather is not even uh appetizing to say oh let me look out the
window and see the bright skies no the weather is also sad so so will you say that um or can that be
um one factor that if i had a biological disposition this kind of situation that i'm in will then
trigger whatever you know bio thing is in mental health is in my genetic yes that's it okay yeah
they kind of similar to like vanessa's example of the students who started like you know going
through their personal problems and yeah yeah yeah wow yeah i mean thank god that there's no genetic
that's a very good point because you know same thing happened to me i moved to the uk
very lonely unfortunately there was the biological predisposition because my mom was oh
so now it's like i'm also full-blown like i have lots of diagnosis and i know it's strange because
i'm a psychologist and you have like oh yes i do you know but then understanding that it's not just a
a sort of like a you're not good enough or you don't have willpower or you're not you know resilient
enough it's a nation of so many things biology you know my my my psychology that is um you know what
what resources do i have available to me to bring joy you know things and then my my societal factors
do i have a community do i stay in touch with people do all these things interact you know so for
some people moving to the uk because they have all of those things they have community they have
you know they they they have things that make them happy they won't be depressed but yeah don't have
that you know and that they might be on the edge of depression but what saves them is that there's
there's not that biological you know yeah yeah okay good to know hopefully i stay in the community
and you have a community at home too yes it but it does but a lot of people complain about it
on social media they say people always say well then just come back home
but it's not it's not as easy as that okay so i guess so now um this brings me to um
um another question is how do you approach breaking down the stigma of mental health with your clients
or within your community
who was to go first edi really by the um mommy because right now i'm still a student um over
well last semester i volunteered at um well i had my internship at a community health clinic and one
way um i was able to like you know um see different ways to like focus on health care i said health
care sorry mental health care was like um diversity and inclusion that's like a big thing especially um
since my campus has like um a big hispanic population there is important to make sure like um you know
you have a link you know knock down that language barrier um learn ways that health um relates to their
um their ethnicity or their race because that's also important like something that we're reading
about in the book might maybe pertain more to a certain type of um population versus like our own or
you know other neighboring ones but i just think diversity is very important especially in the
us i feel the uk too but in the us i can speak for um is like what's different yeah it's important
yeah no i echo everything you said like you just hit it you've hit the nail right on the head
like for me my work is not separate from um advocacy it's not don't separate the two you know
i'm not this um psychologist trained by white people and then i'm coming to my community and
be like oh you know i'm coming to teach you all the white things that no kind of psychologist i am
i'm the type that is always questioning that is always asking so how do we apply this to
people from ethnic minority backgrounds you know i'm really glad that you're thinking about that mommy
because we need a lot of representation in psychology and in mental health and and the whole we don't
have lots of black psychologists in the uk here in the us too yeah it's very very important um
and i think for me just to answer your question about um stigma i i i like to always come from the
person's understanding so before i can understand i can do any work on stigma i need to understand why
mental health is so stigmatized to you what is yeah what does it mean to to have a mental health
condition what would you lose as a result of that who would it affect if you were to identify
becoming a mental health until i understand the person's context i can then project like and say you
know this is what you should do and i don't think that's the right you know approach to mental health
advocacy we always need to understand why is this such a big deal to them take it from there so yeah
for me a lot of the work i do especially in the faith community is to understand what is the fear
about being a christian with a mental health condition what is the fear about being being a
muslim with a mental health condition what is it is the fear coming from judgment from other christians
is the fear coming from your community or is it like self-inflicted and stigma i want to really
understand and then there i offer you know you don't have to whatever they are afraid of losing i i
then offer hope that you don't have to lose that bit it's just adding more tools so let's say you're
afraid that people will say that you're a weak christian well acknowledging that you have mental health
difficulties doesn't mean not weak rather it it shows how much you need god yes true yeah you know
yeah reframing as opposed to like that is wrong don't think that way no like it's more about let's
think about this differently mm-hmm yeah that's how i would do it okay thank you both so much and now let's
talk about some challenges that you have faced um so mommy for instance you when you were volunteering
what were some of the challenges that you faced um while um volunteering um and vanessa in your practice
as well what are some of the challenges you have faced um during my um my oh sorry i said volunteering
was my internship um but okay yeah during my internship i guess challenges i faced was like
communication i was like the um new person in there they seemed to know each other well like the other
workers there so like i didn't want to like you know overstep my boundary but i also sorry it's really
windy over here if i'm breaking out but um but yeah communication was a big thing i had to like
learn how to overcome because another thing too is i'm i'm 24 now and a lot of them are older there
so like how can i come up and talk to someone you know that's way older than me like as if they're
you know my age mate but i had to like get out that mindset too that like you know i'm also you know
there to help out and we're basically working partners but that was just i guess that's the only
challenge because i had a good experience there but yeah with the with the with the students that
you were you were volunteering within the school right yes yeah it's a um community health education
clinic so they give free services to students and um the school the school's community so anyone who
lives there okay so but there weren't any challenges with like the students themselves that you were
volunteering for sorry uh interning for yes like in terms of clients or like people i was working
with yeah the clients the clients patients um there's different you know energy some people are like
you know reserved and others are just willing to tell you any and everything so just learning how to like
you know apply yourself or respond to them and apply yourself in those type of manners where it's
professional but also like you know you want to make it in a like have a good connection with them
because some people are scared to like go to receive health services even if it's free because like
you know the fear of doctors or not having a good um patient and provider relationship so yeah
get that yeah similar things for me as well i think for me starting um on this journey the biggest barrier
for me was the fact that i was from africa from ghana and i didn't system um because i didn't go to
their you know their secondary school and i didn't really understand the education system
um so a lot of it i had to do on my own i didn't know people i wasn't connected to other psychologists
to be like can you read my application i didn't i just didn't know people so everything i could do
on my own and then you get into these spaces and then you're a black woman who like can talk a lot
and when i talk it's like i get you to think because i'm questioning and i'm like i don't accept things
at face value so then you're like who is this black girl and then she has an accent so that's also
another barrier um yeah so but you know i'm here now i'm doing the doctorate now and it's still not
easy i think for me the biggest obstacle is just it's unbelievable but after 10 years i've not
assimilated into the culture and i'm in a very white area and all my clients are white so sometimes they
say certain things about british culture and i'm like i don't get what you're saying like i do
so for me the challenge is i'm not from here you know so it's very very difficult to integrate in
that way um and then again because most of my clients are white because i'm in a white area
i'm always scared when i'm starting with a new client because i'm like what are they going to
think when they see that your therapist is black and she's sent and she's from africa you know
african therapist going to offer me so i'm always sort of i always have that at the back of my mind
but you know like you said like being a therapist is like being a chameleon you change who you're talking
to it's a very relational job yeah like you're yeah yeah you're in the business of talking and
relating to people and studying people and making sure that you're getting the communication right
and sometimes in order to have a strong therapeutic relationship with the client you need to match
their style in that sense become a chameleon in that you change your the color of your skin depending
on your environment depending on the client you're talking to you so the style in which i'll talk to a
client changes depending on who they are and so in a client in a day if i'm going through four or
five clients imagine i've changed myself so many times yeah it's a very tiring relational job you
difficult it's very difficult i think a lot of people think oh all we do is just talk to people
it's not that easy it's not just talking to people you know and especially as someone with lived
experience myself and then sometimes you have clients who are going through the same things that
you are also going through that is also very as well and so yeah those are my challenges so far yeah
okay thank you so i wanted to ask um a technology question because i did my master's in technology law
and i've learned that technology is you know it's not even something that you have to learn you almost
everyone can see that technology is you know weaving its way through every area of law law life so my
question is what how do you see the use of technology or is technology being used in the world of mental
health like is there teletherapy other mental health apps and what are some of the ways that technology can
you know merge into mental health um i think what you said mental health apps that's like something
anybody who has a phone or smartphone can be able to download um i know like one big thing is like calm in
the us people like using that calm yeah okay i think it's like a mindfulness app um i don't have that but
uh like those type of um apps help to like you know it lets someone you know able to practice those
um strategies like right there wherever they are it might be at work it might be home so like this
accessibility for and availability is like really good and um another thing i want to talk about with
technology was biofeedback i don't know if you heard that um vanessa like with the wiring and all that
like it helps people to like keep track of their stress levels and learn how to adapt to like
improving it and when i learned about that in school i feel like it's something new so like you know
they're still trying to find new innovations of how to like you know integrate technology with psych
and i think that's important too because like you said technology has taken over the world so why not
find ways to like help improve like you know on something that we need yeah okay we agree i think
there's been a lot of um advancement in terms of making mental health care more accessible and like
right i didn't even know there was something like technology law so yeah yeah i didn't know that too
but yeah you're right you know technology is everywhere and if we want to make mental health more
accessible we need to think of you know ways to to use technology to to reach more people so i think
if you're looking for skills so like maybe mindfulness skills or breathing skills or you know just um
basic level one like anxiety management skills or things like that there's lots of apps available for
that but where the mental health conditions are complex so like disability disorders lots of trauma
complex trauma um i don't think we need technology for that i think it's it has to be traditional in
the sense that you need to be able to help you regulate and process those emotions in a a healthy
therapeutic way because it with technology you're not getting that therapist feedback
you know it's just you and a device so if it's like i just want skills to just cook in you know
just cook technology is perfect for that but if you want to like process your trauma and talk about
your childhood no i mean i've got an advocate for that but i thought that you know some of these apps
have like you know therapists you know in them so you can get access to a therapist over the apps and talk to
one like like how we're talking now you could probably talk to your therapist like that over
the apps or that's not how they work i know there's hotlines here for people who are like i know it's
mainly um suicidal but like it can be for any kind of like emotion you're going through or um disorder
you're going through so that's like one way to do like a tele um appointment i don't know if that's
the word but like yeah online appointment yeah yeah like there are lots of appointments that we
offer online so you can choose to have sessions online or through a telephone call and i guess
that gives people like options and you know let's say somebody is disabled and they can't come in person
offering the session online is is a best way to do it but then you still have that feedback because
you're seeing your therapist on screen you're seeing your facial expressions you're seeing so
you're having that feedback um in terms of like those platforms i think it's it's it's a way to
connect with therapists i don't think it's it's like maybe like a it's not like a replacement yeah no
is it a sign to find a therapist i'm not sure but yeah there are crisis lines so let's say you're a
suicidal and you just need to speak to somebody in the moment there are lots of crisis lines you can
call and but in terms of if you want like therapy like you know hour sessions you know those kind of
things i would say for the more complex side of things maybe technology hasn't thought of a way to
do that in an ethical way and as of yet um but we do have like technology for the more soft skills level
online techniques um actually going off of the online i think technology definitely helped during
covet time to have online appointments with your doctors or therapists but i know people were complaining
mommy your sound is going can you hear me now yeah okay um yeah so i think it just depends on the
person because some people didn't like you know doing it virtually they liked being in person with
their um it keeps going up okay isn't the wind i'm sure it's the wind
so um so now we so basically we're saying that ai cannot take away your jobs no no okay that's good
to know okay so before we wrap up this session which has also been very informative i must say
is there any other misconception like now you've taught you've taught me something about um the
depression and the anxiety not being emotions is there any other misconception you would like to
clear up to anyone something you've learned during your studies where you you yourself were surprised
you're like oh you know i think what has surprised me so far is the amount of knowledge we need to have
us clinical psychologists so we do research as well but not to the level of phd because you know with
phd the three the whole the whole of the three four five years is just research but we do research like
for a year um and then we have the teaching and then we which we have to do essays for and then we have
the clinical which we have to go to placement for it's a lot and we we cover things like learning
disabilities neurodiversity stroke fibromyalgia and all sorts of disease and it's made me i think what
i'm learning is that psychologists can work everywhere mm-hmm is not just limited to mental health and
because of that we don't psychologists don't just talk to people we're we're people that have stayed
deep to doctorate level well most of it in most countries have stayed at the doctorate level and so
whenever we're offering therapy it's coming from a place of what we've learned what yeah experience
it's not as simple as we're just talking to you and give you advice and i really want to say this
because there's something in the christian community and sorry that i keep bashing the
there's something about i need to see a christian therapist but there's no such thing as christian
therapists there's a thing as a therapist who is a christian but yeah learning we do isn't just tailored to
christian therapy it's like i want to see a christian doctor because they'll give me a christian
prescription a christian type of medication a christian it doesn't exist yeah people are saying
is that well i can't go to a psychologist who has different beliefs because they are just going to
tell me their opinion and i want your opinion to be but a christian but that's not what it is
is of our opinions like when you come to me with a mentor i can't tell you what to do what i can do
is help you to give yourself the answer you need you know so but it's not we are not trained to tell
people oh i think you should no that's not what we do okay for the christian community if you're
thinking well it has to be a christian therapist there's no accreditation board for christian therapists
so somebody can get up and say i call myself a christian therapist but who is your registration
what are you doing that what you're doing is actually christian there's nothing like that
want people to be very careful because you can miss out on very good therapists because you are
looking specifically for christian therapists who will probably end up scumming you because all they
are doing is just giving you their opinion because they are they put christian on their title you know
so we have to be very vigilant in that way you know ask questions when you want to see it but not
anyone who has put therapist in their bio is a therapist you know expectation ask them what kind
of therapy are you trained in you know because they may be trained in cbt different types yeah exactly so
ask questions do your due diligence ask them i'm a christian therapist okay what makes you a christian
therapist your accreditation body even as a christian what kind of christian do you subscribe are you
methodist are you jehovah witness are you what ask questions you know don't just accept things at
face value because your mental health care is so important you might end up causing more damage if you
go to the wrong person yeah thank you mommy i agree um yeah really hard to agree on but i want to start with
like how psychology there's so many different specializations oh mommy your sound can you hear me
can you hear me yes okay yes yeah there's so many different specializations to go into um psychology so
um i feel like that's a great thing um especially if you don't know exactly what
what
no can you hear me now yes you say you have to hold your laptop like this
but yeah i'm really happy about um it having different tracks because like i'm on a certain
track right now health and i believe also to like going off of what you're saying like it's important
that we still knowledge to the people especially if there's a lack of knowledge
that's important to just keep people educated about mental health so that you know um throughout
normalizing
um
thank you um so i picked up on one thing that vanessa said and which is learning disabilities and so i'll
just like to take us back to um how i think that growing up i feel like a lot of our mates or a lot
um this is coming from ghana i feel like a lot of our mates probably had some learning disabilities but
they're probably brushed off because you know we didn't have the knowledge or classmates will be laughing
at the person thinking oh you don't know how to read or you know you can't pronounce certain words or
you are seeing in numbers you know just basically we probably didn't know and so i think that um i
don't know if it has really changed now especially coming from like the basic education if people are
actually aware that this child might probably have a learning disability so how can we help them rather
than say quote unquote quote unquote quote unquote you know you know uh you do mama do you know what
what the trouble means
go talk quote um it means you're dumb yeah i think yeah yeah you know so that's just basically
like my my is it my question or my worry or my yeah i just i just hope that isn't it's still not the
same as it was you know when we were growing up yeah sorry oh no i'll speak about later on because
the us side but yeah yeah no it's still a very big problem at least well in ghana
and my mom so my mom is a she's in the education sector she's a well she she well she she's no
longer a teacher she's an assistant headmistress but she teach she's taught for a very long time
mm-hmm even now she still comes to me to say oh this student has this oh and i'm i'm educating
i'm sending resources i'm saying like read this do this you know still a lot of misinformation
people don't understand there's still the tendency to spiritualize everything you know everything is
a spiritual problem everything is you know um so there's lots of education that needs to happen
there's a lot of learning and unlearning there's a lot of like um i get i guess the people who know
better it's going to it get very tiring you shouldn't stop we shouldn't yeah you didn't start
advocating sometimes it would feel like it's not rewarding it'll feel like people aren't even
listening and but the more we know the better we become so that we can help and teach you know there's
no point of learning so much if you can't help if you can't help yeah yeah so you know those of us
who are privileged to have education let's keep on teaching keep on advocating and not get tired
because we have a long way to go and if we we look to the people to say well they need to change it
it's not going to happen so we need best yeah okay mama what are you going to say no i agree with
vanessa like just keeping people educated i think our generation is starting to do that more especially
like don't identify like you know identifying different um
i work as a teacher they started to like pay attention towards children who might have like
behavioral problems and um i have like certain maybe like certain
like they have to take into consideration that they have to take into consideration that they
have to be so like knowing how to like you know not talk that boundary and like learning how to like
learn how to implement um the knowledge of how to approach children into their um programs and um i think
that if we continue to keep doing that it will definitely help um with improving our knowledge
of mental health you know the funny thing is i didn't break out when i mute when i muted my mic
mama's sound go better so i might be the problem i'll mute myself when you're speaking now okay
okay so now i think i think this is my last question actually um is any advice that you would give to
students or young professionals who are looking to enter the field of psychology let me
so i would say that it's a very long journey but it's rewarding um
um don't don't you first need to understand your why you know it has to be um more than self-serving
you know you you you have to do this job because you you genuinely want to serve other people and
not just yourself you know if you're looking for quick money this is not the job for you this this job is
about people listening to people's you know struggles and difficulties and having compassion
if you're somebody that feels like you cannot have compassion and sympathy for people you have a
very short fuse you you're not an understanding person this is not the job for you so you have to
do lots of introspection ask yourself who who am i really what are my weaknesses um am i willing to
to to work on those weaknesses so that i can pursue a career in psychology and so it really starts with
you it starts with checking whether you have the right temperament and you know characteristics for
this job and then once you you you you feel that you can and you feel that you have reasons that are
beyond self-serving then you have to commit to the journey and it's very long but have your community
um i'm going to put myself out there connect with me i'm happy to be your cheerleader along the journey
and but please you know don't be discouraged we need people like you we need more representation
you're valuable to this profession if you decide that it's the best thing for you um so that's what i'll say
yeah thank you mommy i'll muse myself um i also agree with vanessa definitely um understand the field
you're entering because um with psych like there's so many different ways you can like you know go about
like depending on your interest and i feel it's also important to like you know form a social support
group especially if you're in school because having i can speak from my own experience experience like
having a a couple of friends around to help keep track of assignments projects even meeting new
teachers like i met some teachers that i wouldn't have ever came across if it wasn't for my friends so
like just um being able to like work on your career as well as just um gaining those experience as a
student is important and it's also important to do your own self-research on like um jobs like for me
my master's degree doesn't give us a license after to like practice but there's other things that i
learned that you know through while i was researching that i can like um apply for after graduation so
just make sure you're like um i think vanessa said like look within yourself and just see how it applies
for you like there's so so many things to like go from and um the field of psychology
okay thank you both so so much for your insights um again if could if you want to change one thing
about mental health care or the way that it is delivered would you change something
oh i guess i'm first person um maybe just um towards the availability um for people because
um i guess it varies because in the u.s they're doing a good job in my opinion to like try to expand
it but obviously there's some more work that needs to be done towards like insurance coverage
and like i said like people knowing about it so yeah just to keep pushing it um it to others
thank you yeah i agree with you mommy um i i agree like what i would want to change is to
make mental health more accessible but even more is to have quality mental health practitioners
people who know what they are doing people who are following what they've been taught and not
deviating from it and doing their own thing and people who are committed to giving people um
good experiences not you know being non-judgmental not bringing their own beliefs and stereotypes into
the therapeutic room so i want there to be availability but i also want there to be quality
therapists quality mental health practitioners who do the job very well yeah thank you so so much
