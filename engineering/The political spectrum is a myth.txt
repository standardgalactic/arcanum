so lately i've been getting a lot of comments on my youtube essays which makes me really happy
and most of these comments are funny and smart but there is one type of comment
i get quite often that does bother me and that we need to talk about
puppet of radical left useless coming let me just call this guy out for what he is a
bloody communist this is such a disgustingly marxist leninist clip he's nutty left-wing
guys even the haircut looks like a lefty kind of haircut so why do these comments bother me
well it's not because they call me things that i'm not i don't care about that no they bother
me because they illustrate a deeper problem in today's society which is that there is a tendency
to view absolutely everything through the lens of a left-right spectrum so in this essay i will show
you where the left-right spectrum comes from and i will explain why left-right thinking is stupid
in 1789 france was on the brink of bankruptcy so to address the crisis the french king louis the 16th
summit of the meeting with the three estates of french society the clergy the nobility and the
commoners but this meeting didn't turn out quite as the king had hoped because at the meeting the
third estate the commoners made a bold and unprecedented move they declared that they and
not the nobility or clergy truly represented the french people following this declaration which was
the starting point of the french revolution the people who supported the revolution started sitting
down on the left side of the assembly hall and those who opposed this revolution started sitting
down on the right side of the assembly hall and this seating arrangement is the origin of the left
right political spectrum today over 200 years later the idea of a left-right spectrum is so ingrained
in political thought that if you go to the library and pick up almost any introductory textbook in
political science it will start by explaining this left-right spectrum on this spectrum conservatives
are to the right and socialists to the left and sometimes other labels or more steps are added like
radical progressive liberal moderate or reactionary this left-right spectrum is interesting because there
is a correlation between respective sides of this spectrum and certain policy positions people who identify
with either side of the spectrum they tend to hold a particular basket of political opinions for
example tax cuts are today considered to be a right-wing position this means that if person a supports
lower taxes then he's also more likely than not to support other positions that currently are clustered
on the right wing such as support for israel's military actions and opposition to immigration
and conversely if person b supports higher taxes then he's likely to be on the opposing sides of all
of these other issues in other words he will oppose israel's military actions and he will be favorable
towards immigration and here comes the key question of this essay why is that why do many people's
beliefs across separate issues like taxes foreign policy and immigration cluster this way as either left or
right why is it that someone who's for lower taxes also is more likely than not to also oppose immigration
even though these two are completely different topics well the most common explanation for this that
you will find in textbooks and newspapers and hear from pundits is that the left-right spectrum actually
captures an important essence of human nature this has been called the essentialist theory of politics
and it's completely wrong
i was born on 3rd of february and according to astrology this birth date makes me a so-called
aquarius which is a person who is intellectual creative and independent in astrology there is a simple way to
completely understand someone's personality all you need to do is to place that person on a spectrum of
personality that is based on one single essential parameter date of birth donald trump for example
was born in mid-june and is a gemini therefore we know that he has an outgoing versatile and curious
personality needless to say astrology is nonsense the essentialists theory of politics is very similar to
astrology in that this theory is such that there is a simple way to completely understand someone's
political views all you need to do is to place that person on a left-right spectrum that is based on
one single essential parameter how much you want change if you want change you're on the left if you
don't want change you're on the right your position on this line in turn supposedly explains all of your
other political beliefs so the reason why someone who wants lower taxes also supports israel's military
actions and opposes migration is because that person is anti-change this is a convenient theory because
it allows us to boil all political issues down to one essential question the only problem though is that
this theory is false it's nothing more than astrology for politics if the essentialist theory would be
correct then all of the issues that are bundled together on one side of the spectrum would stay
there across time and across context because they're all supposedly to be pro or against change but
they don't historical evidence shows that issues constantly shift between the left and the right
as for taxes the famous right-wing politicians boys johnson and george h.w bush both adopted tax
increases while the left-wing barack obama and tony blair both implemented significant tax cuts
and as for support for israel the man who's considered the archetypical right-wing extremist
adolf hitler would clearly not support israel meanwhile it was the democrat harry s truman who
was instrumental in establishing israel in 1948 as for immigration the conservative icon ronald reagan
wanted to grant amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants and meanwhile even the socialist icon
bernie sanders has voiced opposition to unhindered immigration in other words there is no fixed essence
behind the left and the right also it doesn't matter if you say that the true essence is not change
but instead for example big versus small government or equality versus hierarchy or collectivism versus
freedom any proposed essence falls apart under scrutiny research has also shown in experiments
that people's views on issues do not cluster to the current left-right spectrum until after they're
socialized into the left-right way of thinking but then the question remains right if there isn't a
single essence that binds together all the positions that are held on either sides of the spectrum like
whether or not they're pro or against change then why do many people bundle their positions to what is
currently considered left wing or right wing this is strawberry arena home of my football team
aik in stockholm there are three major teams aik in the northwest hammerby from the south and
jugorden from the east and i grew up north of stockholm so naturally aik became my team and like most sports
fans fans i support this team year after year even though all the players all the coaches essentially
everything about the team is constantly changing there is no fixed essence that binds me to the team
it's just my chosen tribe most of us realize that it's this type of tribalism that forms our sports
royalties but what many fail to realize it's that it's also this type of tribalism that forms most of our
political opinions in their book the myth of left and right hiram lewis and vernon lewis argue that
we form our political positions just like we form our sports loyalties people first anchor into an
ideological tribe because of family peers or a single issue that they feel strongly about and only then
adopt the full range of beliefs associated with that tribe they call this the social theory of politics
and in their book they point to overwhelming evidence that this theory better explains political
attitudes than the essentialist theory that we have just discussed religious americans are today
strongly anchored to the american right-wing tribe but research shows that it wasn't until the 1970s
when abortion became a political issue that the religious groups anchored with the right-wing tribe not
until then that they adopted the other opinions of the american right-wing like lower taxes and climate
change skepticism another fun study showed that when self-identified conservatives were told that
donald trump supported a policy like increased minimum wage then they would also strongly support
it but if they were told that donald trump opposed that very same policy then they would also strongly
oppose it as the famous scholar dan kahan has put it people endorse whichever position reinforces
their connection to others with whom they share important commitments so the weight of the evidence
points to that there is no philosophical essence like pro or against change that binds together the
different views on the left and on the right instead what binds opinions together is mostly social
conformity and tribalism
there are many issues in politics taxes immigration foreign policy defense the environment trade policy
health care elder care education criminal justice gun rights labor rights infrastructure privacy
antitrust the list goes on however left-right thinking makes us believe that all of these issues
can be condensed into a one-dimensional spectrum conceived during the french revolution
that is absurd some researchers are experimenting with adding more dimensions to the spectrum
one example is the gal tan model that takes a traditional left-right spectrum and
adds another dimension with gal green alternative and liberal at one end and tan traditional authoritarian
and nationalist at the other but i believe quasi-scientific models like these are problematic
because they reinforce the illusion of coherence in political clustering which validates tribalism
and discourages independent thoughts we humans will always have tribal tendencies but we haven't
always been this tribal about politics and we don't have to be just as sports teams wants us to be loyal
fans who buy tickets and merch politicians wants us to be loyal voters and if we're loyal to the
political spectrum then we'll also be loyal to the media that is positioned on the spectrum
and the algorithms will amplify this dynamic all of these forces put enormous pressure on us to become
more tribal and to lean into either the left tribe or the right tribe but we can and we need to
resist this tribal pressure inspired by the book the myth of left and right here are three things we
can do to resist this pressure one let's go granular don't call things left or right say instead what you
actually mean if someone is a wealth tax advocate call him nuts don't call him a communist and if
someone wants to stop immigration say that you don't have to call her a right-wing extremist
two let's disagree so i sometimes get comments like this i saw around five to six videos of yours and
were amazed by the quality in every aspect i was just about becoming a patreon supporter then i watched
this video about migration and you've lost me just there left right thinking spreads the myth that
you have to either agree or disagree with people about everything which is of course neither true nor
possible instead we have to welcome disagreement especially with people we respect because research
shows that allowing for disagreement makes all of us smarter and more efficient three and perhaps most
importantly let's consume less news because by playing into our tribal tendencies the media and
the digital platforms have made us believe that we are doing a good thing for society if we're
constantly living inside our feeds and in the news but in fact the opposite is true to quote the author
oliver berkman in an age of attention scarcity the greatest act of good citizenship may be learning to
withdraw your attention from everything except the battles you've chosen to fight
my name is anderson svedo and this is my youtube channel the market exits
so while i was finishing up work on this essay something quite interesting happened i was approached
by a company called ground news for a potential sponsorship ground news is some type of news
aggregation platform that tracks and rates news outlets based on their political leanings and
they label news as left center or right and i have two things i want to say about this first the fact
that ground news not only exists but it also gets funding and can afford to sponsor youtube creators
demonstrates how deeply left-right thinking has permeated our shared consciousness ground news
might be well-intentioned i don't know but labeling all news as left center or right feels like a
really bad idea to me it oversimplifies the complex it fuels tribalism and again it discourages
independent thinking second this highlights how difficult it is for me to find sponsors because
the truth is that many companies with the money to fund youtube creators have business models that
in my mind no one in good conscience should support and that is why i rely on direct support from viewers
like you so if you like what i do the simplest way for you to support me is to click subscribe like
and to comment and to share this video with your family your friends and your colleagues and if you
really like what i do i warmly invite you to become a patreon supporter at patreon.com
slash the market exit any amount helps and to my existing patrons thank you very much for your
support i'm deeply grateful so why did i make this essay well ever since i learned about the left
right spectrum as a kid in school i felt that it didn't quite make sense and i've also never really
felt at home in either the left tribe or the right tribe and when i decided to make an essay about this
i was excited to find the book the myth of left and right where the authors Hiram and Vernon Lewis
introduced the terms essentialist theory of politics and social theory of politics which
really helped me organize my own thoughts on this topic i think their book deserves way more
attention it's short and utterly convincing and well written and i highly recommend it if this topic
interests you all right thank you for watching bye bye
