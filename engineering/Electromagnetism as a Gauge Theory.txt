positive and negative opposites attract it's a tale as old as time
hmm oh wow there's a whole bunch of positives and a whole bunch of negatives i wonder what's
going to happen oh they're mixing around and relaxing and well look they end up in a nice
little arrangement very nice the crystal was born this is just a simple collection of atoms so take
it as a grain of salt but crystallinity in general is the relaxation of atoms into their low energy
configuration but we don't just have to look at crystals we have technology so suppose we have a
whole row of positives up top and negatives down below now if we shoot a positive test particle
through it's going to be pushed away from the positives and attracted towards the negatives
so its path is going to curve like so likewise if we send a negative test particle through
it's going to be pulled towards the positives and pushed away from the negatives
hmm it's kind of weird how the charges know where all the other charges are i mean how does that
actually work is it like telekinesis like all the charged particles in the universe are talking to
each other at a distance telling each other how much to be pushed around and in what direction
that doesn't seem right whatever is going on here in this universe you'd think that something at
some place shouldn't just be able to push around something else in another place so we come to the
strange and inevitable conclusion that there must be some kind of a something throughout space and
time let's call it a field that charged particles interact with so in this example suppose these
stationary charges give rise to a vector field like so with the vectors pointing away from the positive
charges and towards the negative charges then as we shoot our test particles through the vector field
is going to push them around in accordance with their charge positive charges will be pushed along the
direction of the vector at each point in space while negative charges will be pushed in exactly
the opposite way anti-parallel to the vectors at each point meanwhile a particle without any charge
will just float on by it's like yo i'm not doing all that charge stuff i'm just gonna float on by
okay so electric fields are a thing and also if you've ever done the thing with a magnet and iron
filings you can see that magnetic fields are a thing too so for some reason there are fields
and you know electric and magnetic phenomena were actually known about since antiquity both the
words electric and magnetic come from ancient greek electric comes from the greek word for amber
because amber has some cool static electric effects and magnetic comes from a region of ancient greece
where people used to find these cool magnetic rocks and for the longest time these were just separate
things but later on in the 1800s as people got better at wielding electricity and playing around
with magnets it was discovered that the electric and magnetic fields are intimately related actually
they're two sides of the same coin and they're locked in an eternal dynamic interplay and when they
splash around that's what light is as well as radio waves x-rays microwaves and so on
so a wonderful picture began to emerge where all of the electric phenomena and all the magnetic things
and light itself and even a whole bunch of invisible frequencies of light all emerged as specific
manifestations of more fundamental more elegant underlying patterns these patterns can be described
mathematically the patterns taken on by the electric and magnetic fields are encapsulated by maxwell's
equations the four equations shown here each of these equations is cosmically powerful on its own
so if you equip yourself with all four of them you'll be unstoppable the four maxwell's equations reveal to
us the patterns in the electric and magnetic fields but to do physics with these fields we also have to know
how they push around charged particles and for that we have the lorenz force law which tells us that charged
particles will be pushed along the electric field while they're going to be pushed in a swirly way around the
magnetic field depending on their velocity in both cases the direction of the force depends on the charge
with the field pushing on positive and negative charges in opposite ways the four maxwell's equations combined
with the lorenz force law comprise the mathematical framework of classical electromagnetism which describes
the electromagnetic phenomena to a very high degree of accuracy in practice one also encounters material
properties things like resistivity which can be understood within the framework of maxwell's equations
and the lorenz force law material properties just think of those as things that emerge in the statistical
limits of a very complicated condensed matter system well anyway so at the end of the day it's all about
maxwell's equations and the lorenz force law and you can study this and you can take classes on
electrodynamics and you can solve these differential equations in every which way and you can develop
an understanding of all these different electromagnetic phenomena in technology and in nature but even if
you become a wizard with the vector calculus even if you become a sage with the maxwell's equations
there's going to be a question that will keep you up at night and you'll become obsessed with this question
and this question is why is electromagnetism a thing because it feels like it's an expansion pack that
you have to put on your world view like it's one thing if you're learning physics right you learn about
space you learn about time you learn about force and acceleration and all of that kind of makes sense
you can kind of see that those things are things in the world but then when it comes to electromagnetism
you're supposed to believe that there is such a thing as an electric field and a magnetic field
and the magnetic field is a pseudo vector field it's not even a real vector field and these things
interact and they flop around and that's what light is it's like okay hold on now what like why
like philosophically why right okay so that's the question and this entire video the whole purpose of
it the whole everything we're going to do today is in service of answering that question
because that question does have an answer and it's actually a pretty satisfying answer like
it's actually remarkably satisfying the extent to which we can understand why electromagnetism is a
thing now the answer is simple enough to state why is electromagnetism a thing the answer is because
the durock field has local u1 phase symmetry simple as that right and it is simple as that once you
learn the math once you learn the physics you see it really is as simple as that but of course okay
what does that principle even mean what is the durock field what is local phase symmetry and how
exactly does that principle imply electromagnetism so that's what we're going to be talking about
today here is a brief overview of what we're going to be talking about in this video first we're going
to take it on faith that the durock equation has local phase symmetry so we're going to go into what
is the durock equation what is phase symmetry and then we're going to demonstrate why matter and
antimatter have equal and opposite charge why photons are massless with a four vector wave function
why the electric field exists as a 3d vector field why the magnetic field exists as a 3d pseudo vector
field why these electric and magnetic fields interact we're also going to derive maxwell's equations
so gauss's law for magnetism and electricity faraday's law of induction and ampere's law with maxwell's
addition as well as the lorentz force law and we're also going to see why electric charge is conserved
so as you can see here we're going to be able to turn this simple principle about phase symmetry
into electromagnetism which is remarkable i mean this is going to be very profound it's a beautiful
topic for better or worse this topic involves some pretty sophisticated math and physics that
you normally encounter for the first time as an upper division undergrad and then contend with in
a more serious way in grad school so this video is going to be more hardcore than my previous ones
and so it might appeal to a narrower and more technical audience but this subject matter is too
beautiful not to talk about so i have to make this video okay so here's a brief list of the
prerequisites that you'll want to be familiar with to get the most out of this video first of all
you'll want to have some experience with classical electromagnetism the reason being this video is all
about why electromagnetism is a thing and so you have to know the what before the why is going to
make any sense so you'll want to have some familiarity with maxwell's equations lorentz force law
electric and magnetic fields voltage magnetic vector potential basically if you've taken an
introductory class on electrodynamics you should be okay for this video likewise and this goes along
with electromagnetism but you'll want to have a good understanding of vector calculus at least you'll
want to be comfortable with the idea of like a gradient divergence curl flux integrals that sort of
thing i actually am going to not get too too mathematical in this video like for example i'm not going
to get into differential geometry or fiber bundles even though that kind of math does have some really
interesting applications to the topic of electromagnetism as a gauge theory my goal today
is to teach you the main concept of how symmetry gives rise to electromagnetism and i want to do that
in the most accessible possible way so i am going to be using the language of vector calculus because
that's kind of the lingua franca of stem people and anyway once you learn these ideas you're always
welcome to translate them into whichever mathematical framework you prefer also you're going to want to
have some familiarity with quantum physics so you'll want to know the schrodinger equation the klein
gordon equation the dirac equation and i only mean up to the first quantization so you don't have to
worry about second quantization you don't have to get into the quantum field theory everything we're
doing today is going to be first quantization meaning quantum particles but classical fields so for
example psi is going to be the wave function of an electron and even though the electron's position
and momentum are these fuzzy quantum things psi itself is going to be a field whose values are
precisely defined at particular moments in space and time and that is in contrast with quantum field
theory where psi itself becomes like a fuzzy field but actually quantum field theory is not necessary
to understand how electromagnetism arises from symmetry and so we're not going to do the second
quantization today and also you'll want to have some familiarity with special relativity
so you'll want to be familiar with the concept of lorenz invariance and the mass shell which is the
relativistic energy momentum mass relation in particular you'll want to understand how the mass
shell relates to the klein gordon equation and how taking the square root of the mass shell gives you
the dirac equation and if you like you can refer to my videos on the klein gordon equation as well as the
deriving the dirac equation for more information on that in addition there are some relativistic kind
of mathematical things you'll want to be familiar with so for example the difference between a
covariant and a contravariant four vector you also want to be familiar with things like the four
gradient and just in general being able to think in terms of unifying space and time momentum and
energy probability flux and probability density that sort of thing so you want to have some exposure to
special relativity as well and i know you know it's kind of a tall order to say okay you'll want to be
somewhat familiar with relativistic quantum physics before getting into this video but actually a lot
of these concepts are pretty accessible and you can find them in the book introduction to elementary
particles by griffiths this book will get you up to speed on all of the quantum physics and special
relativity concepts that we're going to use in today's video this is actually one of the best textbooks
ever and i can't recommend it enough if you're interested in these ideas this is one of the
best investments you can make by the way nobody's paying me to say that i'm just speaking the truth
anyway in this video if i say that an equation can be found in griffith's chapter seven or whatever
well that's the book i'm referring to okay also i should mention the conventions that we'll be using in
this video we're going to be using gaussian units which are the cleanest most elegant units for
exploring the theory of electromagnetism so be aware this differs slightly from si units but the
difference in units is not going to really make a profound conceptual difference you know at the end
of the day you can always convert from one system of units to another so but yeah today we'll be using
gaussian units and also we're going to be using the mostly minus metric which is sort of the standard
convention in particle physics and the mostly minus metric is not as pessimistic as it looks because
we're gonna have a positive time sorry oh also i should say if you're not familiar with all of
these concepts don't worry you might still get something out of this video and you can always
think of this video as a way of learning through immersion and besides when you're learning math and
physics it's often helpful to take a look beyond your current horizon to see what's coming up
and just remember that the concept we're talking about today is one of the most beautiful
most amazing concepts in physics and uh so you know but it is difficult and that's okay if it
doesn't make sense all at once it's a big topic you know so if you're not sure whether you're ready
for this topic just give it a shot all right let's get into it so we're going to start with the dirac
equation without any electromagnetic field so this corresponds to a particle that's chilling in the
vacuum of space and the equation can be written as i h bar gamma mu partial mu psi minus mc psi equals zero
okay now first and foremost unlike the schrodinger equation or the klein-gordon equation which both use
a complex scalar field for psi in the dirac equation psi is a four component complex vector which actually
should be regarded as a pair of spinners at each point in space time so psi is not a four vector
it's a bi-spinner and it transforms differently under lorenz boosts but we're not going to go
into detail on that today and naturally one wonders why is it that psi is complicated like this
and the answer for that as we saw in the driving the dirac equation video is that the defining
characteristic of the dirac equation is that it's first order in space and time while also unifying
quantum physics and special relativity and the only way you can do that is to take the klein-gordon
equation and like really squish it down to be first order in space and time the equation really does
not want to do that because it's intrinsically like when you apply the mass shell and the quantum
mechanical energy momentum operators the thing that you get is sort of inherently the second order thing
but if you push hard enough so hard that the commutative property of multiplication shatters
then poor little psi is going to get squished and it's going to go from this complex scalar to this
bi-spinner situation where the different components of it are going to be kind of spinning around
and that spin structure is actually necessary in order to accommodate the full range the full degrees
of freedom that we need in order to have a relativistic quantum physics while at the same
time describing the theory using only first derivatives in space and time now in this equation
the gamma mu partial mu term uses the einstein summation convention where if an index appears twice
in a single term it implies that the term is summed over all values of that index
in general by the way greek indices like mu and mu and alpha and beta these are placeholders for the
numbers 0 1 2 or 3 0 being time-like and 1 2 and 3 being like x y and z okay now in this expression we
see the four contravariant gamma matrices which are four by four matrices containing a bunch of zeros
and some ones and eyes these gamma matrices have the properties required to have a first order
differential equation which uses the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators and also
satisfies the relativistic mass energy momentum relation also known as the mass shell now these
partial terms are the partial derivatives with respect to each component of spacetime
and it's helpful to think of these as components of the four gradient which you can write partial mu
and here notice there's only one index so we're not summing over when you see partial mu think of it
as all possibilities for mu in a four vector so partial mu we can say this is a partial zero partial one
partial two partial three and that is defined as the partial derivative with respect to x mu
where x mu with the mu upstairs is now actually the contravariant space-time position the four position
and if you look at griffith's section 3.2 as well as equation 7.6 you can see more information on that
but for today all we have to know is that the symbol partial mu corresponds to the four vector which is
one over speed of light times the partial derivative in time and then a partial derivative in x and y
end in z and as with all four vectors the factor of the speed of light is just there to make the units
the same for the time component as for the spatial components so in this video when we see partial mu
that corresponds to that four gradient think of that as the space-time gradient and the individual
components partial zero that's one over c times the time derivative partial one is the x derivative
partial two is the y derivative and partial three is the z derivative now the signs on the four
gradient are a bit confusing usually when a four vector has a downstairs index that is when it's a
covariant four vector the spatial components are going to have a different sign than the time components
but in this case the covariant four gradient is actually made of partial derivatives of the contravariant
four position so the signs are actually all positive now if you're not super familiar with the dirac
equation just yet don't worry about it we're not going to have to know everything about it today
but just a few things and we'll just have to visualize a couple of simple solutions to it
which is going to give us insight that we can then mathematically generalize to more complicated
scenarios so first of all let's just go ahead and write out the dirac equation like so
where we're going to go ahead and expand everything so you can see the gamma matrices and the derivatives
and all that now you can see here that the dirac equation says that a combination of first
derivatives of psi each one modified by a gamma matrix equals psi itself multiplied by some imaginary
valued constant this equation has a rich landscape of solutions but by far the simplest one is for a
particle in free space whose momentum is known to be precisely zero now because the momentum is
precisely known and because this is quantum physics what do we know about the position nothing nothing
whatsoever we know nothing about the position and so when we solve for the zero momentum eigenstate
we should expect to find a wave function which is spread uniformly throughout space i went into this
in detail in my previous video on solving the dirac equation for a particle at rest but we'll briefly
review the solution here as a segue into the next topic so we can solve for the zero momentum eigenstate
by recognizing that it won't have any spatial gradients since those encode momentum and so
the spatial derivative terms are going to vanish from the equation now we're left with something where
there's just one time derivative and a gamma zero and an mc over h and a psi well anyway if we write
out the definition of gamma zero and show psi explicitly as a bispinner with four complex components
and while we're at it we'll multiply both sides by the speed of light then we get this equation which
can be thought of as an eigenvector eigenvalue problem and it admits two distinct families of solution
so first of all we have the solutions for which psi one and psi two are non-zero while psi three and
psi four are zero as it turns out these correspond to electrons and they have the form psi electron
equals a b zero zero times the exponential of negative i mc squared over h bar times time
and when you look at that equation what you see is there's this bispinner and the top two channels
are occupied so a and b think of those as comprising a spinner and then the time evolution of that
thing is the same as we would expect to find in the klein-gordon equation it's just a unit length
exponential that's vibing in time with the frequency of the mass energy of the particle divided by h bar
likewise there are solutions for which psi one and psi two are zero while psi three and psi four are
non-zero and those are the positron solutions so you can write them as zero zero c d for some arbitrary
complex number c and d times the exponential of i mc squared over h bar times time now in both of these
cases a b c and d are all just complex numbers and they're typically normalized so that magnitude a
squared plus magnitude b squared equals one and magnitude c squared plus magnitude d squared equals
one and actually you'll typically see this written as just a one symbol for a spinner in the top
component or bottom component but i'm actually going to write it out in terms of the complex components
just so that we can really see what's going on now the time evolution of these two solutions is very
very similar both are just phase factors which oscillate in time with the frequency mc squared over h bar
and the only difference between them is the way in which the phase goes around the complex plane
in time so the two solutions are oriented backwards with one another relative to time and that is the
fundamental and essential difference between matter and antimatter as we're going to elaborate on
later in the video you don't have to take my word for it that these two solutions correspond to
electrons and positrons we'll demonstrate later in this video why that's the case and why these have
opposite charge but for now we should just notice that the structure of the dirac equation gives us
two completely different ways for psi to represent a particle with zero momentum which differ in their
orientation in time and this branching of the equation into these two different modes of solution
even though we've only demonstrated that for the very specific case of the eigenstate of a particle at rest
that branching is still broadly a factor of any conceivable solution of the dirac equation
so if you want to lorenz boost the solution and you get some non-zero momentum eigenstate
and then consider the set of all possible momentum eigenstates and then you're just a
fourier transform away from whatever wavy waves you want in general you're going to have a solution
which is either occupying the top two channels or the bottom two channels with one little tiny little
nuance or caveat which is that technically the top two channels and the bottom two channels they
do kind of bleed into each other just a tiny little bit especially in the relativistic limit but this
can normally be ignored but if you want to see an example where the two sides can kind of bleed into
each other look up the darwin term for the hydrogen atom that's something we'll get to in the future
by the way i have not forgotten about hydrogen part three in fact the last few videos including this
one is still kind of a tangential note between parts two and three so um i will get back to that
someday hopefully someday soon okay so the dirac equation branches into these two different modes of
solution matter and antimatter let's go ahead and consider the electron solution first and you'll
notice that the spinner a b can be thought of as some linear combination of the spinners one zero and zero
one because a b is just a times one zero plus b times zero one now the spinner one zero corresponds to
a purely spin up electron while the spinner zero one corresponds to a spin down electron so if the
electron has spinner a b with magnitude a squared plus magnitude b squared equals one that is normalized
then it's in a superposition of spin states and when its spin is measured there's going to be a magnitude of
a squared probability of measuring its spin up and a magnitude of b squared probability of measuring
its spin down and it's one of the weird quantum mechanical things that when you measure the spin
it's either spin up or spin down uh hey i don't know that's just one of the weird things about reality
you can think of the electron as containing one bit of spin information so it's either up or down
it's super weird but anyway is what it is so now here's something interesting to think about
look at that exponential term which is just a unit length phase factor that thing is going to swing
around a and b in the complex plane but it's not going to change the size of a or b so if an electron
is chilling in free space with zero momentum its spin state is not going to change over time in terms of
likelihood of measuring spin up or spin down but instead its components are just going to rotate around
in the complex plane let's put some visual insight on this we'll use the same flag animation as in
my previous spinner video where on the right half of the screen we see two components of the spinner
and on the left we'll see the flag that this corresponds to because as we saw in the spinner video
each unit spinner evolving under some su2 transformation
can be mapped to a flag which represents a 3d rotation so3 element and in fact su2 double covers so3
so for each flag orientation there are actually two spinners corresponding to that which only differ
in the complex plane picture by a minus sign and to transform one possibility into the other you want
to do a 360 degree rotation that is a class one rotation anyway see my spinner video see also the
paper an introduction to spinners by andrew m steen for more information on this flag diagram
you can also download this python code on my patreon and that's something i want to get better at you
know on patreon i post the pdf video notes for these videos but i also want to start posting more animation
codes so that those of you who are supporting my channel can actually get your hands on some real
genuine for real codes that not only make these pretty animations but also use the math behind them
so hopefully that'll be a good learning resource for you shout out to all my supporters on patreon
i'm really grateful for all of you okay well so remember what we're doing here is looking at a zero
momentum eigenstate that is a state that has no spatial variation no spatial dependence and so we
don't have to imagine these states as an entire field throughout space because instead we can just
imagine what a single spinner would look like and watch it evolve in time and then we can imagine that
the whole wave function is just this spinner vibing like this at everywhere in space so for example what
i'm showing here now is the electron solution for a equals one and b equals zero that is a spin
up electron you can see that as the complex phase factor rotates the spinner in the complex plane
the flag rotates around its axis imagine this flag rotating at every point in space
that's the dirac field for a spin-up electron with precisely zero momentum of course it's not actually a
flag the flag is just a way of imagining the spinner which makes a lot of its algebraic properties much
more visually intuitive by the way shout out to kurt jimongel for introducing me to these flags
for years i had to feel my way around the dirac equation algebraically but these flags have given
me a whole new perspective on the math so instead of lines of algebra with these flags you can just
imagine it and jump right to the solution or at least an outline of the solution so i can't overstate
how much this has improved my life so thank you kurt sincerely and everyone watching this please
consider checking out kurt's youtube channel theories of everything if you like my videos
you'll probably enjoy his channel too oh something else about this flag look at the way it's rotating
take your right hand and curl your fingers around the way the flag is going around
your thumb will point up along the flagpole and that's why they call it spin up so right now in
your mind before you see it on your screen i want you to imagine what the zero one solution is going to
look like that is the spin down electron how will the flag be oriented and how will it be rotating and
what will the spinner look like in the complex plane are you imagining it are you examining the solution
with your mind's eye are you visualizing the solution okay let's see if you were right boom
there it is a spin down electron in the zero momentum icon state it's the same as spin up but
down apply the right hand rule again and now your thumb is pointing down and again as the complex phase
factor rotates the flag around its axis in time it does not change the orientation of the axis so
remember what i said earlier about how the spin state is going to remain the same over time for
an electron at rest in a vacuum so then what about some superposition of spin up and spin down how about
for example 1 over root 2 1 1 which has an equal probability of being spin up or spin down by the
way the square root of 2 is just there to normalize the spinner so what do you think this is going to
look like how will the axis of the flagpole be oriented and how will it be rotating well
here it is you can see that the flagpole is halfway between up and down and as before the rotation in
the complex plane simply rotates the flag clockwise around its axis but wait why is the flagpole pointing
in this particular direction and not some other direction while still being horizontal isn't there
actually a circle of possibilities for a spinner that's equal parts spin up and spin down well yeah
actually there is and it all has to do with the complex phase difference between the two components
of the spinner see both components will pick up the same time evolving phase factor but throughout time
there will be some phase difference between them and that phase difference can be anything between
zero and two pi so notice that multiplying the whole spinner by some complex phase isn't actually
going to change the relative phase difference between the two components and as it turns out that phase
difference between the two components is going to track with that azimuthal angle of the flagpole
so for example here's the state 1 over root 2 1i which is the same amount of spin up and spin down as
before so it's still horizontal but now it's pointing 90 degrees away from the previous state because the
previous state with 1 and 1 had no phase difference between the components but now with 1 and i there's
a 90 degree phase difference between the components and so the flag is rotated 90 degrees relative to what
it was before so in light of this what do you think the state 1 over root 2 1 negative 1 would look like
in that state the 1 and the negative 1 have a 180 degree phase difference
and sure enough the flag points oppositely as the 1 1 state cool well how about 1 over root 2 1 negative
i can you see this spinner in your mind can you imagine how it looks can you mentally do this quantum
physics well there it is so the phase difference between the components of the spinner has a visual
interpretation it plays a role in determining the flagpole orientation and specifically it determines
the angle around horizontally the longitude if you will azimuth is probably a more technical word so on
this topic what if the superposition of spin states is not equally balanced but is more of one than the
other so you know for example 1 over root 5 2 1 which is mostly spin up but kind of spin down and here
again the root 5 is just a normalization constant so that the spinner has unit magnitude so given
everything we've talked about so far which way should the flagpole be pointing notice that 2 and 1
have no complex phase difference between them so the flagpole looks like this by the way this has an
80 chance of being measured spin up and a 20 chance of being measured spin down because 2 squared is 4 and 1
squared is 1 so it's 4 to 1 odds of being spin up and that doesn't come as a surprise because if you
look at how the flag is pointing it kind of makes sense man i love these flags such a useful way of
looking at the math okay a couple more examples here so uh what about 1 over root 5 to i well same as
before but now with that 90 degree phase difference and so the flag is rotated 90 degrees you see how this
all fits together okay so isn't this neat neat little algebraic structure by the way you put a
bunch of different flags in there and you can rotate them all in the complex plane and in the
three-dimensional view with the flags each one is just going to rotate around its axis so this math
is like so cool i love it i think this is just remarkable and what's amazing is that this spinny
behavior this rotating behavior was not put in by force or by fiat it's an inevitable consequence of
writing a first order equation which is both quantum mechanical and relativistic durach isn't that
correct that is correct yes and that forced me into a different kind of equation and this different
equation brings in the spin of the electron it was very unexpected to me to see the spin appearing in
this way i thought one would first get a satisfactory theory of a particle without spin and then one would
proceed to a more complicated theory of the particle with spin but it turned out differently the simplest
kind of particle does have a spin now then what about the positron solutions well in terms of the different
possibilities for the flagpole orientation it's exactly the same ideas as before all the ways the
flagpole can be oriented are encoded in the relative sizes of the components of the spinner and the
complex phase difference between the components then that whole flag just spins around same as before
but in the opposite direction due to the sign change in the exponential so you know you often hear
positrons described as electrons that are moving backwards in time i think that description is
misleading because you know if you drop a grain of salt in a glass of water it dissolves as time
goes on well if you drop an anti-grain of anti-salt into an anti-glass of anti-water it's still going to
dissolve as time goes on okay so there's no time traveling going on here so i like to say that a positron
is just an electron that goes the other way because um that's just ambiguous enough to kind of convey
the message and also for things like dissolving and like thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
you can see that an ensemble of things if you reverse the direction of all the little constituents
you know the behavior at the macro scale can still be the same okay so now we've seen the connection
between multiplying a dirac spinner by a complex phase factor and rotating the flag about its axis
and the key points there is that when we multiply psi by a complex phase factor all we're doing is
turning the flag now there are two things that we should keep in mind first there's an angle doubling
between the complex phase angle and the flag rotation angle so a phase factor of e to the i theta
is going to rotate the flag by an angle of two theta and this pertains to the fact that su double
covers so3 so if we sweep the phase factor all the way around in the complex plane a full 360 then the
flag will rotate twice during that process and that's just part of the weirdness of fermions with their
half integer spin but for today we can just notice this detail in passing and otherwise ignore it
the factor of two doesn't really matter for today and now the second point has to do with the
difference in time evolution between matter and antimatter as we've seen these two options are
oriented backwards relative to each other in time but it's important to notice that this time reversal
arises due to the reversal in the direction that the time dependent complex phase factor evolves in the
complex plane and that the reversal is not due to a difference in the connection between the complex
phase factor and the flag rotation in other words if we go clockwise in the complex plane the flag is
going to rotate like an electron solution and what makes positrons go the other way is that they go
counterclockwise in the complex plane it's not that a complex phase factor rotates positron flags the other
way it's that the complex phase factor itself is going around the other way in time and so the connection
between the complex phase angle and the direction of the flag rotation is the same in either case
okay so now let's explore the concept of local phase symmetry which means that if we apply an
arbitrary local phase transformation to psi nothing observable will change so first let's look at what
a local phase transformation is what that means and what it does and then we'll talk about what it
means for nothing observable to change so first to look at what a local phase transformation is
we should look at not just a single flag but a field of flags at least a two-dimensional slice of
the dirac field since we'll want to see how things change over space when we transform our wave function
and you know looking at a full three-dimensional picture would be a little bit too cluttered but
that's okay 2d is good enough for now so here on the left we have a spin-up electron and on the right
we have a cross section in the xy plane of the zero momentum eigenstate for that electron and notice
that we're looking at it from below so the base of the flagpole is closer to your eyes and the top of
the flag is pointing into the screen so you see how the view of the single flag kind of maps on to the
view with the flags in the field and can kind of see like the orientation there okay our eyes are
in the negative z-axis looking up okay so what we're looking at here is just a very particular
cross section of a very specific and simple solution of the dirac equation so we have to
remember that the electron's wave function can actually be much more complicated than this
and in general the amplitude can vary so imagine that the flags will be larger in some areas and
smaller in others and infinitesimally small throughout most of spacetime for a localized
particle but fortunately just by looking at these simple eigenstates we can get some valuable insight
about how psi is affected by local phase transformations and this will give us a mental
image that will be a great starting point that we can warp and transform as needed when mathematically
generalizing from this specific case to more general situations okay so let's get into it then
what exactly is a local phase transformation well it's simply the act of multiplying psi by some
phase factor e to the i theta where theta is a phase angle that can change in both space and time
and that's what makes the transformation local rather than global so a global transformation is
just multiplying by a constant phase factor everywhere in space and time which is basically just a redefinition
of the phase angle and that's not very interesting or physically meaningful but a local phase transformation
that's a much stronger transformation because that means we can change the phase by a different amount
here versus there now versus later and so this gives us infinitely many ways to mess around with psi
and remember multiplying psi by a complex phase factor has the effect of rotating the flag about the
flagpole so these local phase transformations are going to twist the flags around arbitrarily in space and time
depending on how we define our theta field but the transformation is not going to be changing the
orientation of the flagpoles themselves it's just going to be turning the flags around their flagpoles
okay so let's look at a specific example so here on the left we have the zero momentum eigenstate
of a spin up electron oh and let me say this you know for everything we're about to look at
the direction of the spin really doesn't matter these local phase transformations because they're
going to turn the flags around their flagpole but they're not going to change the flagpole direction
it doesn't really matter which spin we want to look at and the reason i chose spin up with the xy
cross section is just so that we can have a nice easy view of a flag going around and the reason i'm
picking this particular orientation is so that the way the flag goes around looks a lot like the time
evolution of the phase factor in the complex plane okay so then let's define our theta field for the
local phase transformation for starters we'll keep it simple and we'll just use a field where the
phase angle varies along some direction with a constant rate and because phase is a circular thing
if you vary it at a constant rate it'll look wavy and periodic so that's what the phase field is going to
look like here i'm using colors to represent the complex phase in accordance with our usual color
map and i'm also using arrows to represent the complex phase angle and this view is technically
a little bit redundant but i hope it's helpful especially when you're comparing the color of the
flags to the color of the complex phase factor well anyway one more thing to note about this phase field
is that theta is the phase angle and that can be whatever we want it to be but e to the i theta the
thing that we're actually plotting here that complex phase factor is always going to have unit
length right it's an element of u1 so the amplitude or the magnitude of the elements in the phase
field are all going to have the same size and that's important because then when we multiply this field
on psi it's not going to change the size of psi it's just going to slap on a complex phase factor
all right so given our eigenstate psi and our phase field e to the i theta what is the transformed
psi going to look like well it'll look like this oh look at that pretty neat huh so check out what's
happening here on the left side we have our unmodified psi so that's just our eigenstate
then we have the phase field that we're going to use to transform that psi and on the right side we
have what appear to be these propagating waves but notice that all this is is basically just the
phase gradients put onto the wave function and bear in mind the angle doubling and all that
and then all of that's being animated just by the fact that the flags are turning around at
some constant rate and so imposing a phase gradient on psi gives us these propagating waves and by the
way this is basically what a non-zero momentum eigenstate looks like okay in the non-relativistic
limit but um the relativistic limit gets more complicated with the way spinners transform
but anyway it is how it looks okay when you put in this kind of a phase transformation on psi
it's no longer a particle at rest now it's a particle in motion okay so we kind of messed up
psi because this is changing things right this idea about local phase symmetry that you can do local
phase transformations and nothing observable will change uh well that's not looking too good because
here uh we're doing this local phase transformation and we seem to have put some momentum into the
electrons so um hmm so that seems weird why is it like that right that kind of goes against our
deeply held belief that the dirac field should have local u1 phase symmetry so okay so we're going to
talk more about that in just a moment but while we're here let's explore this a little bit more
so you know of course if our theta field varied along some other axis then we're going to see momentum
appearing along that direction okay so we notice that there's a connection between phase gradients in space
and momentum okay well i mean the question comes up what about time let's have a phase field where
for now there's no spatial stuff going on but let's just rotate it in time and see what happens right
well this is going to have the effect of either speeding up or slowing down the rate at which the
flags rotate because i mean it's how it is i don't know what words to put into it but you know the
the phase transformation is either going to be helping the flag along or it's going to be slowing it down
and bearing in mind that the rotation rate of the flags is directly proportional to the energy of
the particle we can see that there's a connection between phase gradients in time and energy now here
i should point out that in reality these flags rotate extraordinarily fast for an electron with a
mass energy of 511 keV the flags are going to spin around like a hundred quintillion times per second
so the phase transformation i'm showing here whose frequency is of a similar order of magnitude as psi
is actually super aggressive like many many orders of magnitude more so than anything that's relevant
to what we'll be talking about today so in case you were wondering what happens if the phase
transformation goes so fast in time that the flag's rotation direction starts to go the other way
the answer is don't worry about it that corresponds to preposterously extreme scenarios
that are well beyond the scope of this video all right well what if we do some crazy phase field
that changes in both time and space well it's the same basic idea about energy and momentum and phase
gradients and time and space but it's just like more wild and complicated but at the end of the day
the way theta is changing in space and time will affect the distribution of how the flags are turning
around and that's going to give rise to these momentum and energy changes in the wave function
okay so the key insights of these animations are that when we do a local phase transformation on psi
gradients in the theta field both in space and in time will change the momentum and energy of the
particle respectively this can be stated more elegantly from a relativistic perspective
the four gradient of the theta field changes the four momentum of the particle
well okay so it actually seems like psi really doesn't have local phase symmetry right
i mean local phase transformations are able to mess up psi in all kinds of different ways
creating a whole four vector of a mess in the particles energy and momentum
yeah so the idea that the dirac fields doesn't actually have local phase symmetry at least not on its own
that's actually true and we're going to get back to that in just a moment but while we're here let's
see how antimatter fits into the picture so for this animation what we have here is an electron's wave
function on the left and a positron's wave function on the right in both cases we're looking at them from
the bottom up with the flags pointing into your screen now the expert viewer will say hey if we're
charged conjugating then shouldn't we also reverse the flagpole direction and yeah that's good
point but as mentioned earlier what we're looking at now doesn't have much to do with the spin
orientation so we can get away without having to flip the positron flagpole around because this way
it's easier to compare the two plots especially as it relates to time reversal now if that bothers you
and you want to flip the positron around you're welcome to imagine the positron flags flipped the
other way but then since they'll appear to be turning clockwise like the electron you'd have to
carefully parse out the nuances about the complex phase time evolution versus the phase to flag
rotation direction and with a lot of mental effort you'll end up at the same conclusion but just
you know in a more circuitous route so the way i'm showing it here is easier to look at so let's
just go with this and then we'll recognize later that the conclusions we come to don't actually depend
on the spin state of the particle so this is okay everything's fine oh and so now in this animation
we're just going to plot the transformed wave functions on the same plot so for example
first we'll use a phase field that's just the number one everywhere and we see the untransformed
wave functions of both the electron on the left and the positron on the right now if we hit the fields
with a spatially varying phase field check this out in the electron field we see the same waves as before
but in the positron field they're going the opposite way what wow why are they moving the opposite way
well because the flag rotation is brought to life by a time dependent complex phase factor
which goes the opposite ways in the complex plane for electrons versus positrons and so the same
change in the complex phase is going to have an opposite effect on the time evolution of the flag
and this is easiest to see from the orientation where the flag rotation looks just like the complex
phase evolution which is why we're showing it here with the flags all pointing into the screen
well anyway at the end of the day the fact that electrons and positrons are oriented backwards in
time relative to each other means that the same phase gradient is going to affect the momentum of
the particle in an equal and opposite way okay and now of course the question is what about time
well if we look at a phase field that's uniform in space but varies in time we find unsurprisingly
that it'll speed up one of the wave functions and will slow down the other so how the phase transformation
changes the energy will also be equal and opposite whether we have an electron or positron and again
if we use some crazy phase field we get crazy results but this thing about equal and opposite
disturbances in psi is still true so that's basically all i'm going to say about antimatter today
from now on when talking about psi we'll assume it's an electron and as we construct electromagnetism
from local phase symmetry all we have to do is remember this picture about matter and antimatter
being disrupted in equal and opposite ways by local phase transformations and we'll see and we'll be
able to intuit that electrons and positrons have identically opposite electromagnetic behavior
that is they have equal and opposite charge all right so now we've seen what a local phase transformation
is and how it affects the dirac field psi and based on what we've seen about changing the energy and the
momentum of the particle we strongly suspect that the dirac field does not in fact have local phase
symmetry that is local phase transformations are not going to leave all observable quantities unchanged
because it's going to mess with the energy and momentum so and that's just like how it seems to be
but to elaborate on this we need a precise definition of what it means to leave all observable
quantities unchanged and for that we turn to the framework of lagrangian mechanics
the lagrangian way of looking at physics is based on the principle of least action which says that
there's some quantity s called the action which will naturally be minimized as things happen in nature
so then if we can write an equation for the action in terms of our field variables then we can see what
has to be true about our fields in order for the action to be minimized and in that way we can derive
the laws of physics for our system when working with fields that vary in space and time the total
action of the system is calculated by adding up integrating over space-time a quantity fancy l which
i like to think of as the activity of the system by which i mean the infinitesimal amount of action
which at some point in space-time is happening right there and right then the word activity feels
right as a sort of intensive version of the extensive action but anyway fancy l is not actually called the
activity it's called the lagrangian density oh but everyone calls it the lagrangian so think of the
lagrangian as a seed that grows into the laws of physics later in the video when we derive the
inhomogeneous maxwell's equations we'll see how this works in gory detail but for now the only thing we
have to recognize is that the lagrangian encodes the laws of physics in a condensed format and this gives
us a great way to define what it means for some transformation not to change any observables if
the lagrangian isn't changed by the transformation then neither will the laws of physics and neither
will any observable quantity so now we can define local phase symmetry very precisely the dirac field
has local phase symmetry if and only if its lagrangian remains unchanged by any arbitrary local phase
transformation so to answer the question of whether the dirac field has local phase symmetry
all we have to do is write out the dirac lagrangian which depends on psi and then apply a local phase
transformation to psi and see if the lagrangian changes in the interest of time i'll just write
out the dirac lagrangian here and i won't go into exactly why it has this form but i'll point out that
this lagrangian directly implies the same good old dirac equation we've been working with
and uses all the same characters and ingredients so the form should not be too surprising and we're
not sneaking anything in here that's electromagnetic oh actually there's one ingredient here that we don't
see in the dirac equation and that's this thing psi bar so psi bar for the dirac equation is much like
psi star is for the schrodinger equation psi star is just the complex conjugate of the scalar psi
but when psi is a bi spinner we have to upgrade that notion to the dirac adjoint which is psi bar
and you can make it in three easy steps step one you take the column that is psi and flip it over into a
row step two is you complex conjugate every term in psi and step three is you multiply the last two terms
by negative one and there you have it that's psi bar okay but other than that all the symbols in
the lagrangian are the same as what we've already used for the dirac equation and so we can go ahead
and start exploring this lagrangian okay so now what we're going to do in order to see how the lagrangian
is affected by a local phase transformation is we're going to replace every psi in the equation
with the transformed wave function e to the i theta times psi where again theta is this phase field
this phase that can change in space and time and by the way now in this equation psi does not have
to be a simple eigenstate it can be a totally general solution to the dirac equation so this goes
beyond the particular examples we've been looking at but those examples will still help us make sense
of this math because they give us like a visual starting point okay so to evaluate the transformed
lagrangian we're going to substitute the transformed psi prime with e to the i theta psi now first if we
look at the psi bar term what we can do is we can pull the complex scalar e to the i theta out of the
bar by recognizing that when you take the dirac adjoint of something you can pull out a scalar by taking
its complex conjugate and the complex conjugate of e to the i theta is e to the negative i theta
then for the psi prime on the right side of the equation we're going to distribute that through
to the left so we're going to let the four gradient act on e to the i theta psi and we're going to have
that mass term mc squared times e to the i theta psi and next up we want to clean up that four gradient
term so when you're calculating the four gradient of e to the i theta psi we can apply the product rule
and first take the four gradient of e to the i theta multiplied by psi plus e to the i theta times
the four gradient of psi so that's just your normal application of the product rule and so now if we
evaluate the four gradient of e to the i theta and we're going to keep things topologically trivial
then we end up with an expression i times e to the i theta times the four gradient of theta
so now what we can do is if we look at both of the terms in that expression we see that they both
have an e to the i theta so we can factor that out now if we look at the term of the transformed
lagrangian you see those blue terms i'm highlighting the e to the i theta times i and you see how that
multiplies through the four gradients of e to the i theta psi so let's bring that together and we'll
let the e to the negative i theta cancel out the e to the i theta and multiply through by i and we see
that the product of that blue and yellow term ends up being simply negative psi times the four
gradient of theta plus i times the four gradient of psi so now we can write the transform lagrangian
as shown simply by replacing the blue and the yellow terms with this green term and while we're
at it you'll notice that the mass term with the mc squared e to the i theta psi we've taken out the
e to the i theta by distributing through that e to the negative i theta so there's no more e to the i
thetas okay and next up what we're going to do is simply rearrange the equation as shown
so here i've color coded the characters so we can kind of see like how it is so basically we've
switched up the equations and kind of move things around and massage the equation a little bit but
we haven't actually really done anything other than that we're just rearranging terms and the
reason we're rearranging terms like so is because now look at the left side look at that left term
psi bar i h bar c gamma mu partial u minus mc squared psi that is the original lagrangian wow and so that
means that the transformed lagrangian is our original lagrangian minus h bar c partial mu
theta psi bar gamma mu psi and so if we assume that term is not zero then we see that the transformed
lagrangian is actually not the same as the original lagrangian because it's picked up this extra term
and so no the drock equation very much does not have local u1 phase symmetry shoot that contradicts the
one thing that we were hoping would blossom into electromagnetism darn it so uh we have two options
here option number one we can give up to do that just turn off the video okay well now that all the
quitters are gone option number two is we do whatever it takes to do what we gotta do this means being
creative thinking outside the box just whatever has to be done so what exactly is the problem that we're
trying to solve well we want the dirac field to have local phase symmetry but based on what we just
saw we can say confidently that the dirac field does not have local phase symmetry on its own
wait on its own the dirac field does not have local phase symmetry on its own but what if we added
something to our model of the universe something that might exist that could play a supporting role
in giving the dirac field local phase symmetry is there any way to do that without it just being
some kind of mathematical trick is there any physically realistic way in which the dirac field
might be given local phase symmetry hmm well we know exactly how the dirac field fails to have local
phase symmetry because we can say with precision exactly how the lagrangian is messed up by some arbitrary
local phase transformation if you multiply psi by some arbitrary phase field then the lagrangian will
be changed by a factor of negative h bar c partial mu theta psi bar gamma mu psi so if we want to give
the dirac field local phase symmetry we need to find a way to counteract that term for all possible phase
transformations at first this seems overwhelming because of the infinite variety of phase fields we can
use to mess up the lagrangian how can we possibly correct for all of these possible things but that
infinite variety is actually helpful because it means that the solution to the problem has to fit the
problem like a glove fits a hand in other words we don't have to think about any particular phase field
and come up with some complicated contrived solution which accounts for multiple different
categories of phase transformations no we just have to completely erase negative h bar c partial mu
theta cyber gamma mu psi for arbitrary theta and so that's the answer right there that's what we
have to do we have to erase that term so to give the dirac field local phase symmetry we simply
redefine its lagrangian to include a term which is equal and opposite to the mess that the local phase
transformation creates this new modified lagrangian is manifestly unaffected by local phase transformations
you can see this by starting with the field theta equals zero in other words no transformation in
which case the term we've added goes away and it's just the dirac lagrangian but then if you switch to
some arbitrary theta field you'll find that our new term precisely cancels out the mess that otherwise
would have been created so that's great we know exactly how we need to transform the lagrangian in
order to give the dirac field local phase symmetry but now the problem becomes how on earth is this
a legitimate move i mean this feels totally like we're cheating or hallucinating or just making up
some nonsense that just so happens to solve our problem but has no underlying reason or justification
to it if we're being good physicists we should call shenanigans on this we can't just go like
redefining things just because it's how we want it to be when it's not if it is and if it isn't what
what well okay let's investigate this in more detail and see what we've actually done here
and see if there's a legitimate way to tell a convincing story to justify why this is an
acceptable move and not just a bunch of nonsense okay so this is kind of an exercise in rationalizing
the irrational but it'll actually turn out to be true and very deep so okay we have our lagrangian
and this is the dirac lagrangian plus this other thing that we're adding on there and hopefully
it's actually real so that we're not just talking crazy talk right now so what is that thing well
let's break it up into two parts first there's the orange part which is h bar c partial mu theta set
that aside for the moment and we also have the purple part which is psi bar gamma mu psi now
psi bar gamma mu psi is actually a very important quantity and you see this quantity all the time
when you're dealing with the dirac equation this is the probability for current divided by the speed
of light and what that is is a four vector where the timelike part is the probability density and by
the way here i'm using rho for probability density confusingly enough later on it's going to mean charge
density but you know in context it makes sense okay anyway now j1 j2 and j3 that is the spatial parts
of the probability for current are going to be the probability current so the way that probability
density flows from one place to the next so this purple term has to do with how much of the electron
is at some point in space and how much it's flowing and this is a contravariant four vector
now if you look at the orange term you see the downstairs mu in the four gradient and a couple of
constants so that's going to be a covariant four vector and we know that because the lagrangian
density has units of energy density this orange term is going to be some kind of covariant four
vector that's going to couple to the four current in an energetic way which by the way that sounds a
lot like the electromagnetic four potential you know so the electromagnetic four potential is a
four vector where the timelike thing is voltage or in si unit v over c and the spatial part is the
magnetic vector potential and that's the kind of thing that if you multiply it by the four current you're
also going to get this energy associated with voltage acting on the probability density
and the vector potential acting in a momentum kind of way on the currents so we're getting hints of
the four potential in here and that's good because that means that maybe we can ascribe a physical
meaning to this but i don't want to import any expectations or intuitions or assumptions about the
electromagnetic four potential for now we're just going to regard this orange term as some kind of
four vector and we're not going to impose any constraints on it other than that it has to be
real and we're assuming that it's real and we're going to predict its properties and we're going to
see if they map onto reality well anyway so starting with this really blank slate perspective of just
saying look this is a covariant four vector and so let's just call it a sub mu like the most generic
thing you can imagine calling a four vector right so that lets us write the orange and purple expression is
a mu psi bar gamma mu psi but actually you know what here we're going to do something here so the
way we've defined a mu you'll notice that we don't have the freedom to change the units of a mu
because a mu is very directly defined in terms of h bar and c and the four gradient of a phase angle
so let's go ahead and do this we'll define the four vector capital a mu
and it'll be the same as a mu but we'll bring in a factor of negative one over q
where q is just some number and right now we'll leave it undefined but what that does
is that doesn't lock us in to a particular unit scale for a right because we can always kind of
redefine what we mean by q and we can say now our base unit for a is going to be smaller or bigger or
whatever it is and we can adjust q accordingly so we're building in a degree of freedom there without
really changing anything in a meaningful way now what about the minus sign that is the benjamin
franklin minus sign this is purely conventional in an ideal world we wouldn't have to put it there
but you'll notice if we write out the orange and purple expression now in terms of capital a mu
we're going to have negative q capital a mu psi bar gamma mu psi and so when we bake into our definition
of a mu this negative one over q that ends up manifesting as a negative q times a mu in the
lagrangian term so at the end of the day those cancel out so that's fine right so whatever magnitude
we put for q that's going to cancel out by the definition of a mu and that just gives us the
freedom to scale the units of a mu to whatever we want them to be which as we'll see later in the
video that's going to be helpful but then the minus sign and the other minus sign cancel out so we're
not actually changing any physics by bringing in this minus sign here okay so we're starting to
massage this term in the lagrangian into this covariant four vector times the contravariant
four current we're starting to get hints of the electromagnetic four potential and so this is kind
of starting to be credible and kind of starting to make sense but there is a problem here and this is
if we want to believe that a actually exists and that it's not just something we're making
up in order to solve a problem and just making stuff up randomly but if we want to say no there
is actually this four vector field it actually exists and it actually couples energetically to psi
then we have to give a a life of its own because you'll notice that as it's defined here a is
directly dependent on the four gradient of theta so if we don't apply a phase transformation say theta
is just zero then a is zero a goes away just because we didn't do a transformation so the way
we've defined it here we have way too much control on the existential status of a just based on whether
or not we're actually messing around with theta and so what we need to do instead is say no
a is not defined in terms of the four gradient of theta a is whatever a is but it has the ability
to be transformed by the addition of the four gradient of any arbitrary theta field okay hold on
now so what have what have we done here well we have a Dirac Lagrangian that doesn't have local phase
symmetry we realized the only thing to do to give it local phase symmetry is to add a term that cancels
out the mess then interpreting that term we recognize that it corresponds to the existence
of a four vector field that couples energetically to psi and in order for this to be credible we have
to let the four vector field have a life of its own but then one wonders what kinds of energy are
going to be contained in the life in the independent life of the four vector field a because if we're
really saying that a exists then we have to let it exist and existence has consequences and when a
flops around there's going to be some kind of energy in that right there has to be otherwise a doesn't
really have an existence on its own and in order for any of this to be credible we should hope to see
at least one way that a can manifest energetically independent of its relationship to psi because if all
a does if a's only claim to existence is its interaction with psi that's kind of dubious you
know i don't know if i trust that but if a actually exists on its own in some way then that lends a
tremendous amount of credibility to this idea and it gives us testable predictions of what does it look
like when a manifests energetically and how is a constrained and what patterns are there and what can
we say about this and what kind of theory grows out of the logical consequences of symmetry in the Dirac
field and the corresponding freedom in a it's like okay there's something we can now explore we need
to find a way that a can exist on its own independent of its relationship with psi okay so we're looking
for ways that a can exist on its own outside of its interaction with psi and one of the most natural
questions we can ask is does a have mass and the way to answer this question is to say okay well if
a had mass how would that contribute to the lagrangian and is that allowed or would that spoil the phase
symmetry of the Dirac field so one of the things that we've seen about a is that it has to be able
to come in and clean up the lagrangian no matter how much we mess around with the phase field when
we multiply psi by an arbitrary phase field and we're creating all these energy and momentum gradients
and we're messing up the lagrangian our four vector field a has to come in and offset that and clean
that up and but meanwhile we have to have total freedom to do whatever kind of phase field we want
to do so it follows that there can't be an energy cost or an energy benefit associated with how much
or how little of a we have we want to be able to pull in as much as we want it's like imagine uh
imagine you spill a gallon of milk on the floor and you will grab a whole bunch of paper towels to clean
it up or maybe you just spill a couple drops of water on the floor and you grab one paper towel to
clean it up that's not a great analogy but the point is if a is going to be the best picker upper
of a mess that we're making in the lagrangian then we have to be able to pull in as much or as little
as we want and we can't meet any resistance that comes along with well you're pulling in too much a
or well you're not pulling in enough a no no we need to be able to pull in as much as we want
and what this implies is that a has to be a massless four vector field because if a had mass then
the amount of a you have changes the energy landscape and so therefore it can't clean up
the mess that we're making because then a itself would actually violate the symmetry that its whole
purpose is to come in and provide the dirac equation but similar reasoning would also seem to suggest
that the derivatives of a can't contribute to the lagrangian either because depending on how you
mess with the phase field sometimes you might need to bring in an a field to clean it up that's a
little bit scrunched or maybe not as scrunched or is floppy or not so floppy and so when you think
about the space and time derivatives of a if any of those contained any energy that is if the field
were like kind of elastic you know then it would seem like that would also violate the local phase
symmetry of the dirac field because in just the same way that we need to be able to pull in as much a
as we need or as little a as we need we should also be able to pull in as scrunchy or as floppy of an a
as we need without there being any change in the lagrangian but if that's the case then a really can't
do anything on its own because if the amount of a can't contain energy and if the derivatives of a can't
contain energy then a's only claim to existence would be the way that it augments the energy momentum
landscape of psi and that's not very satisfying but fortunately it's not very true either because
there is one secret loophole where you can set a derivative against another derivative and so even
though each of these terms is affected by arbitrary phase fields the way in which they're affected is
equal and opposite and so it cancels out such that the whole expression is completely agnostic to
completely unaffected by any arbitrary local phase transformation so this loophole has a very
particular form a very specific form and it has to be of the form partial mu a nu minus partial mu a mu
because then the changes are going to cancel out let's look at an example just so you can see
specifically how this works so consider partial 1 a2 minus partial 2 a1 or in other words the derivative
of the y component of a with respect to x minus the derivative of the x component of a with respect to y
now if we apply a phase transformation on psi then a is also going to have to transform
so it's going to pick up that term of negative h bar c over q times the four gradient of theta and so
therefore if you want to split that up into components ax is going to pick up a term that
has to do with the derivative of theta in x and ay is going to pick up a term relating to the derivative
of theta in y so now if we evaluate this expression partial x a prime y minus partial y a prime x that is
the derivative expression applied to the transformed a we can evaluate both terms one of them is going to be
the x derivative of the transformed a y component including that y derivative of theta term that
gets picked up during the transformation and the other term is going to be the y derivative of the
ax component minus that x derivative of theta term now based on the symmetry here you can kind of see
how these things are going to cancel out but if you go ahead and evaluate this through let's go ahead
and separate out the derivatives of a from the derivatives of those theta terms and we can see
partial x a y minus partial y a x minus h bar c over q times this term that involves the x derivative
of the y derivative of theta minus the y derivative of the x derivative of theta and because the order
doesn't matter when you're taking a second derivative those terms are going to cancel each other out and
what we're left with is the partial x a y minus partial y a x which is exactly the form of the expression
applied to the unmodified a field so in other words no matter what theta field we put in
this expression involving partial x a y minus partial y a x is going to end up being totally the same
because each half is going to be affected by an equal and opposite amount and this generalizes to all
possibilities for mu and nu and so in general the expression partial mu a nu minus partial nu a mu
is going to be completely insensitive to any arbitrary local phase transformation so this is
like a special trick that allows a to escape the tyranny of the phase field and notice that the form
of the trick the contour of the trick fits like a key and a lock to the constraints of local phase
symmetry the reason that this loophole the reason that this trick has the form of a derivative minus a
derivative is that the way the phase field affects a takes the form of a derivative and so the nature
of this trick follows necessarily from the nature of local phase symmetry in the durock field now
naturally the question arises how many different ways are there of applying this trick and so therefore
how many different ways can we expect a to flop around on its own independently of its relationship with
psi well in our universe there are three dimensions of space and one dimension of time for a total of
four dimensions of space time and if you think about the different combinations of things there's actually
six ways to pick two of those dimensions see because there's three ways to pick time and a space dimension
you could do t and x you could do t and y you could do t and z
z and also there are three ways to pick a space and a space dimension because each of those ways is
going to leave one dimension unselected so for example you can do not x not y and not z so in
other words yz and xz and xy okay and for each one of these ways we can write the expression which
corresponds to the derivative of this component of a with respect to that component of space time
minus the derivative of that component of a with respect to this component of space time
and what each one of these things is is actually going to be a scalar field at every point in space
and time because a is a four vector that's defined throughout space time and so this combination of its
derivatives of its components is going to manifest as six scalar fields that can actually contain
energy like real energy like for real actual energy so this is quite an interesting situation
if we're taking this gauge theory stuff seriously if we're really thinking that there must be this
four vector and it must be able to flop around and there's six ways for it to do that without being
affected by arbitrary phase transformations then we should expect to find six scalar fields pervading
space and time which can contain energy now how are we supposed to think about six scalar fields i mean
that's kind of a good number of scalar fields well if you look at the patterns that i'm showing here
you can see that we have three ways to pick a time and a space and there's three ways to pick a space and
a space but first let's look at the options that involve a time and a space so those three options
those three scalar fields are all basically the same thing the only thing is one of them has to
do with x and one of them has to do with y and one of them has to do with z and so naturally we can
compile those three scalar fields into a three dimensional vector field because the one involving
x that's just going to be the x component and the one involving y is just going to be the y component
and the one involving z is just going to be the z component
And this vector field is what people have been calling the electric field.
So now it's a profound and subtle point that I want to make here.
I'm not saying import your intuitions and assumptions about the electric field.
I'm saying that these three scalars that involve a time and a space,
by virtue of their common origin and by virtue of the nature of their definitions
with regards to the derivatives of A,
these three scalars can naturally be compiled into a vector.
And that vector has exactly the properties of the electric field.
And so this field that people have been calling the electric field from the Greek word for amber,
it doesn't really have anything to do with amber, right?
So you can forget about the biases that come in when you think about the word electric.
No, it's just a straight up vector field that comes out of the math.
So I'm going to call it the electric field.
And I'm going to prove to you that it is the electric field as we derive Maxwell's equations.
But notice that, you know, earlier I mentioned that it feels like electromagnetism is an expansion
pack that you have to put on your worldview, because you have to take it on faith that things
like the electric field and the magnetic field exist.
But you don't have to do that anymore.
You don't have to believe as a first principle that there is such a thing as an electric field.
You just have to believe that the Dirac field has local phase symmetry, and then you get
the electric field automatically for free, by virtue of three of the six ways that A can
flop around on its own.
So you probably see where this is going.
What about those other three ways, the ones involving space and space?
Well here, it's less obvious how to make a vector out of these.
And in fact, you can't.
But you can make a pseudovector.
And you know, a pseudovector is a thing that looks like a vector, but secretly it's not.
Because when you look at its reflection in a mirror, it picks up a minus sign that a vector
wouldn't pick up.
So for example, if you imagine an angular momentum vector, it's actually a pseudovector,
because it's based on the way things are swirling around.
And if you reflect that, it's going to swirl the other way, so the vector is going to flip.
And so every pseudovector is secretly an oriented plane.
Well, anyway.
Anyway, so let's call the pseudovector B for pseudovector.
And the x component of B is going to be the way that doesn't include x.
So the one that includes y and z.
And it's actually going to be the negative of that way.
And the negative sign is there so that we can compile these ways into the curl of the
spatial part of A, as we'll see in a moment.
But it's okay to put a minus sign on this, because the minus sign doesn't actually give
us a different degree of freedom.
It's still the same thing, right?
It's still the same mode that A can flop around in.
Okay, so then for the y component of B, for that one, we're just going to take the second
option involving x and z.
We're not going to put a minus sign.
And then for the z component of B, we're going to take the minus sign of that third option
that includes x and y.
And that, if you compile into a vector and you recognize the definition of the curl, you'll
see that this vector-like thing is the curl of the spatial part of A, that is the curl
of the magnetic vector potential.
And that is none other than the magnetic field.
Okay, wait a minute now, hold up.
This is really an astonishing thing to say, that the electric and magnetic fields are just
ways of mathematically encapsulating the six ways that A can flop around on its own.
Like, whoa.
Like, I remember the first time I saw this, I was, like, dizzy.
Like, I had to sit down in a chair and take a moment to reflect and be like, wait a minute,
what?
That's all the electric and magnetic fields are?
Like, they're, it's math?
It's all pure math?
Like, whoa.
And, you know, once you see this, you realize that you don't really even have to talk in
terms of electric and magnetic fields if you don't want to.
You know, because E and B, these things are, I don't want to say it's a useful fiction,
because I think that's not quite accurate, but it's sort of an arbitrary convention.
And if you've studied electromagnetism, you may have heard of the Faraday tensor.
That's the tensor whose components are the components of the electric and magnetic fields.
And that's sort of a more uniform, more holistic way of describing the situation with the six
ways that A can flop around.
But even the Faraday tensor itself, which we'll talk about in a moment, but even that
tensor itself is just one way of describing what's going on.
So the core concept here is, don't take the electric and magnetic fields too literally.
Don't even take the Faraday tensor too literally.
Okay, well maybe take that one a little bit more literally.
But the point is, examine the roots of these concepts, and you'll find that all it is,
is just the six degrees of freedom that A has available to it without disrupting the
local phase symmetry of the Dirac field.
Now, I'm going to share with you a mnemonic device that has been stuck in my head, and
for better or worse, because it's really effective, and it's really memorable, but it's also kind
of silly and whimsical.
Which, now that I think about it, is actually, this is just a good thing.
Okay, so here's the thing.
In order to put in your mind a permanent understanding of the connection between the electromagnetic
four potential, and the electric and magnetic fields, and or the Faraday tensor, what you
can do is, in your mind, create a category called the six ways, and regard this category
with a kind of mystical significance.
So imagine there's some meditation music playing, maybe a little bit of pan flute, and
in your mind think about, oh yes, okay, we have this four potential, and then there are
the six ways that it can flop around on its own.
And when you think about this in your mind, pretend that it's kind of a spiritual fact,
you know, like some spiritual knowledge that you've gained access to, that you've tapped
into, you know, like, now you can see the six ways that A can flop around.
And remember that, because I know it's silly, I know it's like there's no logical reason
to think about it in that way, but the point is, if you keep that in mind, and remember that
it's just six ways that A can flop around, then you'll always remember what the electric
and magnetic fields are, and you'll always remember what the Faraday tensor is.
And in general, you'll feel a lot more comfortable with all of this math, and you'll also be able
to go kind of like underneath the electric and magnetic fields, where you don't take them
so literally, and you can kind of see where they come from.
And this will give you some real genuine insight.
So for example, let's use this perspective about the six ways to derive the homogeneous
Maxwell's equations.
We're going to start off with Gauss's law for magnetism.
And this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which implies that
every magnet has a north pole and a south pole.
So to do this derivation, all we have to remember is that B, the magnetic field, is the pseudovector
part of the six ways.
And in particular, B is the curl of the spatial part of A.
Now, if we want to calculate the divergence of B, all we have to do is calculate the divergence
of the curl of the spatial part of A, right, of that vector potential.
And here, if you've learned vector calculus, then you'll know what this is right away.
The divergence of the curl is zero.
And this is a general mathematical statement.
And so there in one line, there's the proof, right?
So the divergence of B is the divergence of the curl of the spatial part of A, and so therefore
the divergence of B is zero.
That's literally the proof of Gauss's law.
It comes right directly out of the nature of the equations.
It's beautiful.
Okay, you know, this proof was so short that let me actually go ahead and just give a quick
proof that the divergence of the curl is always zero.
For those of you who haven't seen that before, this might be helpful.
And it also kind of shows, like, what's going on here in a little bit more detail.
So if you take the divergence of the curl of any vector field A, then you can write that
out by putting in the definition of the curl, which is this expression that has a bunch of
partial derivatives minus other partial derivatives.
And to take the divergence of that, you just go ahead and take the derivative of each component
along that dimension, and then you just add that all up.
So that's the divergence operator.
And when you do that, and you factor things out, you get a bunch of second derivatives.
And then you'll see that they actually pair up and cancel each other out.
And so anyway, you end up with a zero.
So that's a really general mathematical statement.
And that is why Gauss's law is a thing.
At the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that the B field, that pseudovector field,
is the curl of another vector field.
So yeah, no, it can't diverge, it can't converge.
It's just zero divergence.
Oh, and by the way, you'll often see Gauss's law written in two different ways.
There's the differential form, but then there's also the integral form.
So the differential form is what we just derived.
That's the idea that the divergence of B is zero.
But that can also be written in a more macroscopic way, using the integral form, where we can express
the same fact in terms of a flux integral of B through any closed surface.
These two things are directly related by the divergence theorem, which tells us that the
volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux integral of the
closed surface containing that volume.
The divergence theorem basically just tells us that one way to think about what the divergence
is, is as like a flux integral volume density, or vice versa.
One way to think about what a flux integral is, is like the accumulation of sources and
sinks within a closed surface.
So if you take the divergence theorem, and you plug in the fact that the divergence of B is
zero, then you can prove that the flux integral of B through any closed surface is also zero.
Both ways of saying this are conveying the same basic idea, which is that magnetic fields,
they don't source and they don't sink, they don't poke more out than they poke in, they
just kind of swirl around.
Okay, so that's one Maxwell's equations down, three to go.
Next up, we'll do Faraday's Law of Induction, and this tells us that the curl of the electric
field is negative one over the speed of light times the time derivative of the magnetic field.
In other words, the way the electric field is swirling around in space has to do with the
way the magnetic field is changing in time.
So the proof of this fact is very similar to the proof of Gauss's Law for magnetism.
All we have to do is write the definitions of E and B in terms of the components of A,
because, you know, as we saw earlier, E and B both come from the six ways.
And so when we write that out, we get that E is negative one over C partial A partial T minus
the gradient of the time component of A, which, by the way, here I'm writing as A sub T.
It's kind of a non-standard notation.
Normally, at this point, you'd write it as V in Gaussian units or V over C in SI units,
because that's voltage, right?
So the time component of the four potential is voltage.
But I'm writing it here as A sub T because I want to emphasize the unity of all these
equations.
I know when I was learning this stuff, I would see A and V, and they kind of felt like different
things.
So, you know, I don't want to split that out unnecessarily.
Although, of course, you know, it is voltage.
So, well, anyway, and now looking at B, again, it's just the curl of the spatial part of A.
So, the curl of the vector potential.
Okay, cool.
So, let's just go ahead and calculate the curl of E and see if it equals negative one over
C partial B partial T.
And if it does, great.
That's the proof of Faraday's law of induction.
So, let's do it.
Okay, so to calculate the curl of E, we're going to take the curl of the definition of
E, which is negative one over C partial A partial T minus the gradient of the time component
of A.
And the curl is a linear operator, so we can go ahead and break up that expression.
We can take the curl of both parts, and so that gives us negative one over C times the
curl of the time derivative of the vector potential minus the curl of the gradient of the time
component of A.
Well, you know, earlier we saw that the divergence of the curl of a vector field is zero, and
similarly, the curl of the gradient of a scalar field is zero.
And so that term, negative curl of the gradient of A sub T, that just goes away.
That's zero.
By the way, the proof for that, you can imagine by, if you've ever seen that drawing of the
stairs, where it's like four stairs and it goes up in a spiral, and somehow it's like
it's always spiraling upstairs, that's not real.
That can't happen in real life, because the slope of something doesn't curl, right?
So the curl of the gradient is zero.
You can prove that in a more formal way if you want, of course, using the definitions
of curl and gradient.
Well, anyway, so that term goes away, and we're left with negative one over C times the time
derivative of the curl of the vector potential, that is the spatial part of A.
And, well, wait a minute.
The curl of the vector potential, that's the definition of B, and so that expression is
negative one over C times the time derivative of B.
So yeah, that's totally true.
And so we've just proven Faraday's Law of Induction.
So to convert Faraday's Law of Induction from the differential form to the integral
form, typically what you want to do is take the flux integral of both sides of the equation
through some surface.
And this is usually imagined as a circle, just to keep things simple, but it doesn't
actually have to be a circle.
Okay, and now all we have to do is apply Stokes' Theorem to the left-hand side of the equation.
So Stokes' Theorem is the idea that the flux integral of the curl of a vector field through
some surface is going to be equal to the circulation integral of that vector field dotted
with the line element around the surface.
And one way to think about what Stokes' Theorem is, is if you're like, okay, what is the flux
of the curl of a vector field through a surface?
That's just how swirly the vector field is around the edge of that surface.
Anyway, what that lets us do is that lets us write the left-hand side of the equation
in terms of a circulation integral or a line integral instead of a flux integral, and that
is Faraday's Law of Induction written in integral form.
And this is the form of Faraday's Law of Induction that you'll typically see when you
have those experiments where you're like poking a magnet through a solenoid, you know?
And it's like, hey, the rate of change of magnetic flux is inducing a swirly electric
field in the solenoid.
And so you can make electricity just by moving a magnet, and wow, isn't that amazing?
But now that we're hip to the six ways, we know that it's actually not too surprising
that this is the case.
Okay, well that is the homogeneous Maxwell's equations.
They are baked into the nature of the electric and magnetic fields.
And in a moment, we're going to see how to calculate the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations.
These ones also have to do with the nature of the electric and magnetic fields.
But they also include electric charge and electric currents.
And so if we want to derive the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations, we're going to have to
take that into account as well.
And we're going to have to look not just at the nature of the electric and magnetic fields,
but also the details of how they couple to the electron field and all of that.
So anyway, we'll get to that in just a moment.
But before moving on from the homogeneous Maxwell's equations, I want to make a point
about the philosophical status of these equations.
So imagine that I came up to you and I said, hey, I've made a discovery.
I've noticed that whenever you add the magnetic field to itself, the result is the same as
doubling the strength of the magnetic field.
So b plus b equals 2b.
So wow, isn't that amazing?
You know, hey, maybe this can be a fifth Maxwell's equation.
Let's call it B. Hill's Law of Magnetic Edition.
So can I get a Nobel Prize?
I mean, isn't this an amazing discovery?
It's like, no, it's not at all.
Not even remotely.
But why?
I mean, is it not true?
Well, no, it is true.
So the question isn't to be or not to be, but rather, should the mind suffer the slings
and arrows of outrageous and irrelevant equations?
And of course, the answer is no.
If an equation is obvious, it's unnecessary and it doesn't have to be a thing.
And from a gauge theoretic perspective, the same is true when it comes to the homogeneous
Maxwell's equations.
When you think about A and the ways that it can flop around energetically, you realize
that there's going to be a vector, there's going to be a pseudovector if you want to
talk about it in that language.
And if so, then the pseudovector is going to be the curl of the spatial part of A and
curls don't diverge.
So we don't really need to say that it doesn't diverge.
It just doesn't diverge, right?
Based on the definition, based on the nature of how it is.
So Gauss's law for magnetism is sort of like B plus B equals 2B.
It's like, well, yeah, okay, but, you know, we don't necessarily need to even say it anymore.
And the same is true of Faraday's law of induction.
That just comes straight out of the common definition of the electric and magnetic fields.
So it's actually really neat because when you think about things from a gauge theory
perspective, you realize that when you understand the homogeneous Maxwell's equations, they
disappear, they vanish.
Philosophically, they vanish.
They're still useful.
Look, from an engineering perspective, if you're writing software, you'll still use these equations.
I mean, they're fine.
They're true.
But philosophically, you don't need to rely on these anymore.
They don't hold anything up.
They're just manifestly true insofar as the Diracville has local U1 phase symmetry.
On the other hand, we also have the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations.
And these equations involve charge and current.
And while they also are a logical consequence of local phase symmetry, they're a bit harder
to derive.
Actually, they're, quite frankly, a lot harder to derive.
Because in order to derive it, we have to think not just about the nature of the electric
and magnetic fields, but we have to think holistically about the interaction between
psi and A and derivatives and space and time and a lot of different things.
So in a few moments, we're about to bust out the variational calculus.
And we'll actually derive those equations.
But first, in order to do that, we have to introduce a couple of concepts.
So first, we're going to talk about the Faraday tensor.
And then we're going to use the Faraday tensor to write the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics.
Okay, so we saw earlier in the video that there are six ways that A can manifest energetically,
independent of local phase transformations on psi.
And we saw that if you arrange them so that the time and space options are on one side,
and the space and space options are on the other side, then you see the electric field
and the magnetic field. But there's no law of physics that says that we have to arrange
our thoughts in that way. The only thing we're really constrained by fundamentally is the fact
that there are four dimensions of space and time. So suppose we want to have some equations that are
more unified and more conceptually elegant than equations involving electric and magnetic fields.
Like let's say we want an equation where maybe it leverages matrix algebra. Maybe it's something
that lends itself better to computation and is a little bit more structured and organized.
Well, one way to go about that is to say, okay, well, we can make a table where each row and each
column is going to correspond to one of the four dimensions of space time. And then we can populate
the table with each option of picking those two dimensions and applying the loophole that lets
A flop around energetically, independent of local phase transformations. So this table goes by the
name of F mu nu. And this is called the Faraday tensor, also known as the field strength tensor.
This is an object whose components are components of the electric and magnetic fields. But the tensor is not
inherently fractured in the same kind of way that equations involving electricity and magnetism are
going to be fractured. Now, when we look at this table, it's quite a mess. I mean, there's a whole
bunch of characters and a whole bunch of different options. But there's a couple of things we should
notice. First of all, each one of these options has the same form. So each element in F mu nu is just
partial mu a nu minus partial mu a mu. And so even though it's a lot of things, it's all the same
kind of thing. But now the thing is, wait a minute, is this 16 ways? 4 by 4? That's 16? I thought there
were only supposed to be 6 ways. So something's wrong here, right? But don't worry, the situation is
not as dire as it seems. Because if you focus on the diagonal terms, you can see that each one of
these diagonals is just a thing minus itself. And so those are all zero. So what we have here is a
tensor whose diagonal is zero, and then it has an upper triangle and a lower triangle. Okay, so there's
not actually 16 ways. Well, wait a minute, there's still 12 ways. And that's twice as many ways. There
should not be 12 ways, there should be 6 ways. But now notice the symmetry of this tensor. So for
example, look at the blue term that I've highlighted here, and compare it to the red term.
Well, if you multiply the blue expression by negative 1, and then switch its components around,
you're going to end up with the red expression. So in other words, those two elements are the same
thing, up to a minus sign. And so actually, collectively, they comprise only a single degree
of freedom, only a single way, not actually two different ways. And if you pick another pair,
you can see that it's the same thing. So for example, the ones involving zeros and threes,
each term is actually the negative of its diagonal counterpart. And if you apply this to the whole
tensor, you can see that the top triangle and the bottom triangle are like mirror images of each
other, but with a minus sign. And that's okay. Like if you look in the mirror, technically you're
backwards, but it's still just you. There's nothing like you look in the mirror, and it's like someone
else in there. So if you think about the degrees of freedom, you can see that actually,
yeah, there's only six ways. Well, now if that's the case, then we should expect in each of these
triangles to find the components of both the electric and the magnetic fields. So first,
if we start with the components in the time row and the space columns, we can see that these are
the definitions of the components of the electric fields that we identified earlier. Now because the
tensor is mirror reflected with the minus sign, and by the way, this is called antisymmetry, so that we
can say that the matrix is antisymmetric, then the time column and the spatial rows are just going to
be the negative components of the electric field. Okay, and now if we look at the space and space
components in the top triangle, what we see here is just the components of the magnetic field that we
identified earlier. There's some differences in minus signs because of the way the cross product is
the definition of the magnetic field. My advice, honestly, don't worry about minus signs in any of
this. Okay, I mean, be careful about it, but like don't try to memorize them all. There's just so many
minus signs. I don't know about you, but personally, the hardest thing about physics is knowing where to
put the minus sign and knowing where to put the factor of two. So the philosophically important thing
is just to see that the Faraday tensor contains the electric and magnetic fields, and don't worry too much
about minus signs, especially when you factor in like index lowering and index raising, and it's like
it's okay if you drop a minus sign when you're learning the stuff that happens that's natural.
I still do it to this day. So okay, and once again, if we look at the bottom triangle, we see a reflection
of the same thing. So down there, we also have the magnetic field components. Now when you look at this
square, you see it's actually quite redundant, and you don't really need to imagine it as a square.
You can just focus on one of the triangles, whichever one you prefer, that's fine. And in
your mind, you can imagine it that there is an electric field row, and then there's like this
little magnetic triangle. One thing I should say is I know this seems a bit unnecessary. I mean,
we have a 4x4 matrix with 16 possible terms, and we're only carrying about six of them. That's only
like 40% real estate utilization. So it seems not ideal. And in a way it isn't. I mean, there are
advantages of using electric and magnetic fields in that it's kind of cleaner in some sense.
But notice the conceptual simplicity of having all of these degrees of freedom in one object,
and think about the computational benefits that come along with that with being able to write it
as an array. And then think from like a Zen perspective that anything that has computational
benefits is also going to be kind of more elegant and maybe more in line with a more concise and
meaningful description of nature. So this Faraday tensor is actually a really cool thing.
And as we'll see later in the video, this is going to let us write the equations of
electromagnetism in a much more elegant way. Oh yeah, and also one more thing is when you think
about this, it's like, okay, you can do electromagnetism, any calculation, without using
the electric and magnetic fields. So when you embrace the Faraday tensor, you see that even the
word electromagnetism is almost like an antiquated portmanteau. You might as well call it Faradayism
or something. Or light, or I don't know, local phase symmetry, whatever you want to call it.
Well, anyway, while we're here, I should also tell you about the upstairs Faraday tensor.
So first of all, if you notice that the mu nu on this matrix is downstairs, you can also have an
upstairs version. And that you get just by raising the indices. And all that means, and by the way,
this depends on the metric you're using. Here again, we're using mostly minus. But when you take
it upstairs, the electric field components pick up a minus sign. And again, don't worry too much
about that. There's like minus signs and not minus signs everywhere. And it's confusing, but
that's okay. This is similar to having like a contravariant or a covariant four vector,
and you're going to multiply them together. And, you know, so this kind of goes to the structure
of special relativity. But we're going to kind of see how this appears in equations later on. So
don't stress too much about trying to memorize where the minus signs go. It's all good. And
also, you can always refer to Griffith's equation 7.71 to see the definition of the upstairs Faraday
tensor. Okay, so now that we've seen the tensor f mu nu, let me tell you about the scalar quantity
f mu nu f mu nu. And what this is, is like the magnitude squared of the Faraday tensor. And
this is a very important ingredient in the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics.
So to understand what this is, the first thing we have to do is recognize that we're using the
Einstein summation convention. And because mu and nu are both repeated, they're both summed over.
And so this is actually going to be a sum over 16 terms, one for each possibility of mu and nu.
And what each one of these terms is, is the product of a downstairs Faraday tensor element
times the corresponding upstairs Faraday tensor element. We have to be mindful of the downstairs
and the upstairs and the signs, but that's all good. You don't actually have to do this calculation
like more than once. So I just want to do this real quick. And I'll show you what it equals. And
then you can just remember what it equals. Okay, so first of all, if you look at the terms where mu
equals nu, and you think about the zero diagonal and the Faraday tensor, you can recognize right
away that all of those terms are going to be zero. So those are not going to contribute to the sum.
And now if we look at the terms where one of the indices is zero, we can substitute in the
definition of the components of the Faraday tensors. And we can see that these are all just
going to be the electric field components times themselves with a minus sign. And so that just
becomes negative components of the electric field squared. And if you want, you can add those all
up as just the negative magnitude squared of the electric field. And similarly, if we look at the
terms where neither of the indices are zero, we see the components of the magnetic field. And in this
case, they either have two minus signs or no minus signs. And so those all end up being positive.
And so you end up with the positive squares of the magnetic field components. Now to add this all up,
we just have to draw a diagonal line and recognize that the top and bottom halves are the same thing.
And so this expression, when you add it all up, it ends up being just two times the magnetic field
magnitude squared minus the electric field magnitude squared. So remember this, whenever you see f mu nu,
f mu nu, if you want to think about that in terms of electric and magnetic fields, all that is is twice the
magnetic field squared minus the electric field squared. And this is a special quantity because you know how
magnetic fields arise from moving charges. So let's say if I'm electrically charged, and I'm just
sitting here, and we're sitting together on the couch or whatever, then I'm putting off an electric
field, but I'm not putting off a magnetic field. But if you're walking by, then now all of a sudden
relative to you, I'm a moving charge. And so now just by walking by, you sense a magnetic field in the
room. Admittedly, a very weak one, unless you're walking by very quickly. But anyway, all that's to say is
that the electric fields and the magnetic fields on their own are not Lorentz invariant quantities.
Different inertial observers are going to disagree on how strong the electric and magnetic field is
at any particular point in spacetime. But all inertial observers are going to agree on this quantity
that is the difference in the field strength squared. This is similar to the invariance of the
spacetime interval or any other Lorentz invariant quantity. Now conventionally, this f mu nu, f mu nu term,
you often see it divided by 16 pi in Gaussian units. And so on the right side, that just ends
up being 1 over 8 pi times the magnitude of the magnetic field squared minus the electric field
squared. And what each of those expressions is, think of it as the energy density of the magnetic
field minus the energy density of the electric field. And you know what, now that I'm looking at
this, we've got the b squared minus the e squared. But we're using the mostly minus metric. And so we kind
of want something where the time-like thing is positive and the space-like thing is negative.
So let's actually multiply through by a minus sign. And this is basically just the same thing as
before. But now the time-like thing has a positive sign and the space-like thing has a negative sign,
which kind of aligns more nicely with the whole mostly minus thing, you know?
So a quantity like this is just asking to be popped into a Lagrangian. And in fact it is. So this
is the photon's kinetic contribution to the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics.
Now when you first see this, you're going to think, wait a minute, 1 over 16 pi, where does
that come from? And the answer is, that's put there in order to make the equations pretty.
And the reason we can do that is because remember earlier we said that we're going to make the charge
this letter q, instead of just the number 1, we're going to say let's make this q, because then we
have the flexibility to define the scale of a. Well now we're cashing in on that. And we're going
to say, okay, we're going to define the scale of a such that the coefficient on this part of the
Lagrangian can be a nice clean 1 over 16 pi. So this is an acceptable legitimate move. But it is a
little bit unsatisfying that we have this degree of freedom here and that we get to make this choice
in the first place. In an ideal world, it'd be nice if the scale of the photon's kinetic
contribution were locked in by some kind of deeper principle. And that's the problem of the fine
structure constant. So we'll talk about that more in a moment. But first, I want to write out the
Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics so we can see how everything fits together. First up, we have this
term psi bar i h bar c gamma mu partial mu minus mc squared psi. And that is the free Dirac term,
that's the electron's kinetic and mass energy. Then we also have the interaction energy, which is
negative q psi bar gamma mu psi times a mu. And you can think of that as the electron's four current
coupled to the four potential. So that is the energy associated with the interaction between the
electron field and the photon field. And then finally, we have the kinetic energy of the photon
field, which as we've just seen, is this quantity 1 over 16 pi f mu nu f mu nu. And one thing that I
haven't really done is I haven't really justified why it is that the kinetic energy of the photon field
should have the form that it does. I mean, as we've seen, we can arbitrarily choose what we want that
constant to be. So that's okay. And also, if we're thinking about it relativistically, we do need a
Lorentz invariant quantity. And f mu nu f mu nu is the Lorentz invariant quantity, the simplest one
that we can make out of the Faraday tensor. And we have to use the Faraday tensor because that
encapsulates all of the degrees of freedom by which A can flop around independently of local phase
transformation. And so if we tried to use anything outside of the Faraday tensor, we're going to spoil
the phase symmetry. So the form of this component of the Lagrangian is very, very plausible. It's
actually, it's kind of like the simplest thing it could be. But the question arises, well, why
couldn't it be that squared or that cubed, or some expression involving higher orders of this term?
Well, there's a couple things I want to say about that. And oh, by the way, shout out to Jonathan
Gorard for helping me figure this out and think this through. Follow him on Twitter, that guy's like a
supergenius. So first of all, if the term f mu nu f mu nu were more complicated with higher powers and
that sort of thing, then we wouldn't be able to derive the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations. And we'll
see that in a moment, part of the derivation is going to be involving taking derivatives of the
Faraday tensor. And you'll see when that time comes that it's a good thing that it's f mu nu f mu nu
and not something else. So to the extent that we want these ideas to be coherent with Maxwell's
equations, we need this term f mu nu f mu nu, because otherwise we would end up with nonlinear
equations. And Maxwell's equations are famously linear. So okay, but technically, that kind of
feels like we're cheating, because it's like we know we want to get Maxwell's equations, we know
they're linear. And so therefore, we're kind of preempting that. And so we're making sure that f mu
nu f mu is simple. And that's actually a good point. So let me just confess that right now,
we're leaning a little bit on Occam's razor. And we're just saying, look, this is the simplest
Lorentz invariant scalar that we can make out of the Faraday tensor. And so in some sense, this is
mathematically the most plausible form of the Lagrangian that we can come up with, then we're
going to realize that it leads to electromagnetism. And so we're going to sort of take this as true.
But strictly speaking, just the constraints of local phase symmetry, and special relativity on their
own, do not necessarily imply that this part of the Lagrangian has to have precisely this term.
But anyway, it just so happens that in the universe in which we find ourselves,
and at the kind of energy scales that we're typically interested in, electromagnetism takes
the form of linear differential equations. And that's precisely what we get when this term in
the Lagrangian has the simplest form that it can have. So okay. Oh, and remember, technically,
this expression with a fancy L, it's actually the Lagrangian density. Everyone calls it the
Lagrangian, but it's the Lagrangian density. So if you integrate this over space, then you get the
Lagrangian. And if you integrate it over spacetime, you get the action. And then the principle of least
action lets you turn the Lagrangian into the governing equations of whatever system you're looking at.
So that's kind of how this plugs into physics. Okay, so let's reflect on this for a moment.
And what we have here, this equation, this iconic, beautiful equation, is the QED Lagrangian.
And this is the seed that grows into the electromagnetic phenomena. So the blossoming
of this equation is responsible for like most of the worlds that we see around us. It's an amazing
thing. And you can think of it as the Dirac Lagrangian with the local U1 symmetry upgrade.
So if you take the Dirac Lagrangian for a free electron and say, I want to do whatever minimal
thing I have to do to give that local phase symmetry, then this is what you end up getting.
And so fundamentally, that's all this really is.
So now let's go ahead and use this Lagrangian to calculate the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations.
And we do that by minimizing the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian density over
spacetime, with some arbitrary psi. So some arbitrary electron field psi.
And we allow the photon field and its derivatives to vary and flop around as needed to relax the
Lagrangian.
Okay, so before we get into the calculation for the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations,
I want to draw an analogy to a famous problem in variational calculus that can serve as a kind
of imaginative metaphor for the calculation that we're about to do.
So this is the catenary curve problem. And the problem is, how do you calculate the shape
that a telephone wire takes on between two telephone poles? And the key to solving this
problem is to say that it's going to be the shape that minimizes the gravitational potential
energy, because that's going to be the most relaxed shape. And you also have to put in your
boundary conditions. So you say, okay, it'll be connected to this pole here and that pole over
there. And it's going to have some constant length. And so given all the curves that have
those constraints, which one minimizes the gravitational potential energy? And then the
key insight at the core of variational calculus is to recognize that the optimal curve is going
to be the one where if you give it some arbitrary infinitesimal nudge in any way that it can be
nudged, then to first order, you're going to get zero response in the variable that you're
trying to minimize. So in this case, if we took the telephone wire, and we imagined giving it a
little tiny nudge up and down here and there, the variation that we'd find in the gravitational
potential energy for the optimal curve is going to be zero. And that's a special property of the
equilibrium solution. And this is roughly analogous to doing an optimization problem in calculus,
where you can look for the optimal points by looking where the derivative is zero. When you're
doing variational calculus, you can look for the optimal curve or surface or whatever,
by looking at the point where the variation in the variable that you're trying to minimize
is zero relative to small infinitesimal nudges in every which way that the thing can be nudged.
Of course, the nudges have to respect the boundary conditions of the problem. So for example,
in the case of the telephone wire, you see that the wires are connected to the poles and the nudges
don't change where they're connected. They only change in between the boundaries.
That'll be relevant later, as we'll see. And so anyway, to solve the problem,
what you end up doing is you calculate the gravitational potential energy as an integral
over the curve subject to some constraints. And then you analyze that while adding to the curve,
some arbitrary nudge profile, some arbitrary function of x that vanishes to zero at the
boundaries. And you'll find that the only way to ensure that is zero, that is the only way to
ensure that the curve minimizes the gravitational potential energy is going to be to satisfy some
constraint in the integrand that ends up giving you a differential equation that you can then solve
for the optimal shape of the curve of the telephone wire. And it ends up being a fairly
tedious differential equation. But at the end of the day, you find that it is a cosine hyperbolic
cosine. And anyway, so that's kind of a lot of work just to be able to say, you know, technically,
it's not a parabola, but that is what it is. And so the reason I bring that up is because
the calculation for the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations is actually very, very similar in essence
to the calculation for the curve taken on by a telephone wire between two poles.
Now, instead of a telephone wire, it's going to be the photon field and its derivatives that are
allowed to vary. The condition is going to be that we're going to have some arbitrary electron field
psi that A is going to couple to. And instead of minimizing the gravitational potential energy,
we're going to be minimizing the action S as defined by the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics.
And instead of working in a two dimensional space, we're going to be working in a four
dimensional relativistic space time. But other than that, it's a very similar problem.
So the reason I bring up this telephone pole analogy is to show you that even though what
we're about to do is quite a calculation, in your mind, you can have an image of the photon field
relaxing around psi. And the constraint that makes this happen, the thing that A has to be like in
order for that to be the case, is ultimately going to be an equation that describes how A has to be
given some electron field psi. And when you talk about that in the language of charge and current,
we're going to find that that is indeed the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations.
This calculation is not for the faint of heart. We must approach it with courage and determination.
We start with the principle of least action. First, we recognize that the action S is defined as the
integral of the Lagrangian density over some chunk of space time. Then, applying the principle of least
action, we're going to minimize this quantity. This occurs when the first variation in the action is
zero. Sort of like optimizing by setting the derivative equal to zero, the action is minimized when any
arbitrary infinitesimal nudge on the photon field has a vanishingly small effect on the action.
So now suppose we have some arbitrary electron field psi. We want to know then what must be true of the photon
field A, which is coupled to psi, in order to relax the action S into its minimum value, out of all
possible field configurations. What must be true about A, in order for the principle of least action to be
satisfied? Hmm. Well, we can write out the variation in S as the variation in the integral of the Lagrangian
density over space time, because that's the definition of S. And that's all fine and good, but now we want
to know what happens when we give our photon field a little bit of a nudge. And we can nudge it not only in
the value, but also in the derivatives of the field. Because as we've seen, the photon field contributes
to the Lagrangian in two ways. One, its value, its magnitude, at a particular point in space is going to
contribute to an interaction term with the electron. So we for sure have to vary it with respect to its
magnitude. But also, we notice that derivatives of A appear in the Faraday tensor, that is, in the photon's
kinetic contribution to the Lagrangian. And so we're also going to have to vary the Lagrangian with
respect to derivatives of the four potential. So the question is, how much does the action vary
when we nudge the photon field and we nudge its derivatives? And the answer is, it's going to be the
partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to each of those things that we're nudging. You can
think of the partial derivative terms as a kind of sensitivity. And it's almost tautological,
right? The amount to which the Lagrangian is going to be sensitive to a nudge in some variable is going
to be the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to that variable. So now what we have here
is an expression involving partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to A, as well as with respect to
derivatives in A. Here I should make a point to note that mu as well as nu can each take on a value
between 0 and 3, 0, 1, 2, 3. And so in this expression, we actually have 20 terms. I know it
looks like two terms, but that first term involving nudges in A, that's actually four terms, one for when
nu is 0, and then 1, and then 2, and then 3. And the second term involving the derivatives of A
is actually 16 terms, one for each of the possibilities of mu and nu being 0, 1, 2, and 3.
And that corresponds to the derivatives of each component of A along each dimension of spacetime.
So in the integrand, we actually have 20 terms, but thanks to the convenient notation that we're
using, we only have to write two terms that correspond to the general category of terms that
are in this equation. And so we can carry them all through systematically without having to always
write down each and every one. All right, so now the next thing we'll want to do is write the
variation in the derivative of A as the derivative of the variation in A. Because if we can write
that second term in terms of variations in A, that is nudges in the photon field, then we can factor
out the nudges in the photon field, and we can bring together both of these terms. So because the
variation and the derivative are independent, we can go ahead and write the variation of the
derivative as the derivative of the variation. Now we're getting somewhere because you can see
that the variations in the integrand are on the four vector themselves. We're no longer taking the
variation of the derivative. But on the right-hand side, we do have the derivative of the variation.
And as long as we have the derivative of the variation, we can't factor out the variation.
So we need to do an integration by parts. Integration by parts is the idea that the integral of udv
is equal to uv minus the integral of vdu. This is a standard calculus procedure.
And when we apply it to this expression, just the right-hand side of the integrand, that is the one
with the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to derivatives in A, we can expand this
as the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the derivatives in A times the
variations in A evaluated at the boundary of our space-time hypervolume minus the integral of
variations in A times the derivative of the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to
derivatives in A. Confusing, right? Yeah, okay. But you know what? There's one thing that actually
really helps us out here, which is that just as in the case of the telephone wire, the nudges vanish
to zero at the boundaries of our analysis. So we're only nudging the stuff inside the thing that
we're looking at. I mean, if you want, you can use an arbitrarily large space-time hypervolume,
don't get me wrong, but we can go ahead and set the nudges equal to zero at the boundaries.
And what that's going to do is when we evaluate that term on the volumetric boundary of our space-time
hypervolume, it's going to go to zero because the nudges are zero out there. And so therefore,
that variation in A term, also known as the nudge, doesn't exist on the volumetric boundary of the
space-time hypervolume. So that's just a long-winded way of saying we don't have to worry
about that boundary term, because all of the nudges happen within the region of space-time that we're
analyzing. Well, okay, so having done that integration by parts, and having set the boundary
term to zero, we now see that we have a way of rewriting the second part of our integrand
in a way that actually does have variations in the four vector just directly there, right? We
popped it out of the derivative. And so now what we can do is if we combine that back in to that top
integral up there, and go ahead and factor out a variation in the photon field, that is a nudge
in the photon field, now we have an expression where we have some partial derivatives inside of
the integrand, and that whole quantity is multiplied also inside of the integrand by a nudge in the
photon field. But here's the thing, in this analysis, we're allowed to nudge the photon
field any which way, at any point in space and time, we can give it any kind of directional nudge
we want. And so the only way that delta s is going to be zero, that is the only way that the variation
in action is going to be zero, is if that term that multiplies the nudge is zero. And this constraint,
this differential equation makes it so that the variation in action is zero, and therefore the
principle of least action, or technically stationary action, is satisfied. So all we have to do now is
solve this equation. Oh, by the way, this is called the Euler-Lagrange equation, and it's basically a way
of writing the principle of least action in differential form. So you know with the Maxwell's equations,
we have the differential form, we have the integral form, it's kind of the same thing in two different
ways. Well, and so too, we have the principle of least action, which is kind of this macroscopic,
global, integral kind of statement. But then we have the Euler-Lagrange equation, which is the
local, microscopic, differential equation that must be true in order for the action to actually be
optimized. So nature doesn't somehow magically, psychically conspire to minimize the action.
But instead, the principle of least action is actually a global kind of integral way of stating
something, which is actually a differential equation. And the equation we're showing here,
the Euler-Lagrange equation, this is actually very generic, and you'll see it in all kinds of problems.
Now this particular form is what you get when you try to minimize the action with respect to
variations in a four-vector field, but you'll see a very, very similar equation if you have like a
scalar field, or whatever the case may be. Well, now all we have to do is solve the Euler-Lagrange
equation. How hard can it be? It's hard, but that's okay. Ask not for easier equations,
but for stronger coffee. By the way, if you happen to have any coffee, now is the time to drink it.
We're not done yet, we still got a ways to go. Okay, well, let's go ahead and write out our Euler-Lagrange
equation. So this equation has a whole bunch of derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to A,
and with respect to derivatives of A. And just a reminder, the letters mu and nu are both just
placeholders for 0, 1, 2, and 3. In this equation, you can think of it as nu taking on any particular
value 0, 1, 2, or 3. And meanwhile, mu takes on all values and is summed over. So if you want,
you can think of this as a four-channel equation where each channel corresponds to a single value of
nu. And then the right-hand side of each channel is actually the sum of four terms,
one for each possible value of mu, 0, 1, 2, and 3. So now to solve this equation, let's write out our
Lagrangian. Of course, now that we're experts on the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics, and we see
how it arises from local phase symmetry of the Dirac field, we immediately recognize this term
involving the electron field, and the interaction term involving both psi and A, and a term involving
the kinetic part of the photon field, which is expressed with those Faraday tensors. Hold on,
wait a minute now. Normally, when we write the Lagrangian, we write it in terms of mu and nu,
but here we have it written in terms of alpha and beta. No worries. Same exact concept. These are all
just placeholders for 0, 1, 2, and 3. The reason we're writing it with alpha and beta now is because
we already used mu and nu in the Euler-Lagrange equation. And what we have to do if we want to
evaluate the Euler-Lagrange equation is we have to take all those derivatives and stuff with regards to
the mu and the nu, and we have to apply that to each of the components of the Lagrangian with regards
to the alpha and the beta components. So from a combinatorics perspective, there's going to be
an enormous number of terms in this equation when we combine these two things. So don't be alarmed,
but when you dice this up into scalar components, we're dealing with a four-dimensional partial
differential equation of like hundreds of terms. Fortunately, most of those are going to turn out to
be 0, so that's nice. But anyway, thank goodness for the Einstein summation convention,
so that we don't have to write out all of those terms, because that would take, like, forever.
You know, Einstein, that guy had a lot of good ideas. That's probably why everyone called him
Einstein. Well, anyhow, let's go ahead and evaluate the left-hand side of our Euler-Lagrange equation
first. So on that side of the equation, we're going to take the partial derivative of the Lagrangian
with respect to the newth component of the four-vector field. Now, before we take this partial
derivative, let's look at the form of the Lagrangian, and we'll notice a couple of things.
First of all, we're taking a derivative with respect to the components of the four-vector.
So the term involving purely the electron field, that has no dependence whatsoever on the components
of the four-vector. So therefore, the partial derivative of that term with respect to the four-vector
is 0. That's going to vanish. So, nice. However, the next term, that one involving the charge and the
interaction, that does directly depend on the components of the four-vector. So that is going
to stay in. That doesn't vanish out. But then the kinetic term, the term involving the Faraday
tensors, remember, those are made out of derivatives of the four-vector field. So when we're taking this
partial derivative with respect to the components of the four-vector, the term that depends on the
derivatives of the four-vector is not going to be directly affected by the derivative in the four-vector
itself. So therefore, that term is also going to vanish, because it only depends on the rate of
change of the four-vector in space and time, but not on the value of the four-vector components.
Okay, sweet. So we only have to worry about the interaction term. And that term directly depends
on the components of A, where, just go ahead and imagine that negative Q, psi bar, gamma, alpha,
psi, that's all a constant with respect to the component A alpha. And so therefore, if we evaluate
this partial derivative, we can go ahead and pop that constant outside the derivative. And then we
just have the partial derivative of the alpha component of A with respect to the new component
of A. Now a partial derivative like that can only be one of two things. First of all, it's zero if alpha
and new are different. So if you're taking, for example, the partial derivative of the x component
of A with respect to the y component of A, that's zero, because those are two totally different
things. So, you know, there's no derivative there. But by the same reasoning, if alpha and new are the
same, so suppose we take partial derivative of x component of A with respect to the x component of A,
then that derivative is one because the derivative with respect to itself of anything is one.
And so this is interesting because what this means is that this partial derivative is going to delete
everything except for when alpha equals new. So if you examine this expression with the gamma alpha
in the psi sandwich and the partial derivative, that's going to reduce to a gamma new in a psi sandwich
because that's the only term that remains that doesn't get deleted by the partial derivative becoming
zero. Bear in mind, by the way, in this equation with the alphas, it's a sum over alphas because that
alpha is repeated in the term involving the gamma and the partial derivative. But all of the non-new
possibilities for alpha get deleted by the partial derivative. Okay, anyway, I think I've belabored that
point. So where does that leave us? Well, let's go ahead and recognize something. This term on the
right, negative q psi bar gamma new psi. In order to make sense of this term, we have to look to the
definition of the four current. The four current written in contravariant form, we can write as j with
the nu upstairs. And that's going to equal the speed of light times the electric charge density
combined with the electric current. And that is the charge of the particle times the speed of light
times psi bar gamma new psi. Okay, so now do a bit of pattern matching. And these terms only differ by
a negative c. So go ahead and factor this out. And you end up with one over negative c times the
nu-th component of the four current. Bear in mind, this equation has four channels for nu. Nu can be
zero, one, two, or three. We're not summing over nu. They're just four equations in parallel. One way to
think about this is as an equation involving four vectors. So if you want to think about the partial
derivative four vector of the Lagrangian with respect to the components of a, we can see now
that that is equal to the four current up to some factor of speed of light and a minus sign.
This actually makes a lot of sense. Because think about it, how sensitive is the Lagrangian going to be
on changes in the four vector field a? Well, just consider the nu equals zero term, that is the time
term of a. The sensitivity of the Lagrangian on the voltage is going to be proportional to the
charge density, right? And likewise, if you consider the spatial parts of a, that is the magnetic vector
potential, how much does the Lagrangian depend on changes in the vector potential? Well, that has to
do with how much electric current you have somewhere. So this equation actually makes a lot of sense and
lends itself to physical interpretation, so we're on the right track. Now let's go ahead and mosey on
over to the right-hand side of our Euler-Lagrange equation. There we find a derivative of a derivative
with respect to another derivative. Yo dawg. How are we supposed to deal with this? Well, let's look at
the Lagrangian. If we start off with the electron term that only involves psi and not a, then we can
recognize that the derivative of that part of the Lagrangian with respect to the derivatives in a
is going to be zero. So that term is not going to contribute at all to this mess of a derivative
situation that we have, so we can safely ignore that. By the way, notice that in both sides of the
Euler-Lagrange equation, we were able to ignore the first term involving only the electron's wave
function. And the reason for that is that, remember, we're assuming that there is some arbitrary
electron field psi, and we're letting A relax. That is, we're letting the photon field relax around
that psi, and what that's going to do is that's going to give us the constraints on A that minimize
the Lagrangian given some electron field. So at the end of the day, what that's going to give us is
some equations about how the photon field has to be given some distribution of charge and current,
and that is precisely what the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations are. Okay, so moving on to
the interaction term, here we notice that it is, from the perspective of partial derivatives involving
A, it's basically a constant times A. But in this term on the right-hand side of the Euler-Lagrange
equation, we're actually taking the derivative with respect to the derivatives in A. So even though the
interaction term involves the values of the components of A, it doesn't actually involve
the derivatives of A. So therefore, when we take the partial derivative of that term with respect to
a derivative in A, the result is actually zero. See, because we're not taking the second derivative
with respect to A, we're taking the partial derivative with respect to a partial derivative of A. So it's a
little confusing, but hey, at the end of the day, what it means is we can safely ignore that interaction
term. So that's wonderful. But now we turn our attention to the kinetic term of the photon field.
And we see these Faraday tensors. And what are Faraday tensors made out of? A bunch of derivatives
in A. Shoot, that's exactly what we've got to take the derivative with respect to, so this term is not
going to vanish. Okay, so now we get to evaluate this messy derivative of this Faraday tensor thing.
Well, all right, let's do it. So the first thing we'll do is we'll notice the negative 1 over 16 pi.
That's a constant. So let's just go ahead and pull that outside of the derivative.
And now we can write this expression involving the derivatives and just the product of those
Faraday tensors. And now, actually what we're going to do is let's go ahead and combine the left-hand
side and the right-hand side of the Euler-Lagrange equation. We'll bring these two things together.
So on the left side, we have that factor involving the electric 4 current. And on the right side,
we have this mess of a derivative with the Faraday tensors. Let's go ahead and stick them
together. And I'll do a little switcheroo so the left is now the right and the right is now the left,
but it's all good. Okay, well, now we have a whole mess to deal with because there's derivatives and
Faraday tensors and 4 currents and like, whoa. But you know what? This equation, it actually smells
like the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations because think about it. What is the Faraday tensor? It's made
out of derivatives of the 4 potential. And what is the electric 4 current? It's electric charge and
electric current. And so what this equation is telling us is that there is some relationship
to the way that the photon field flops around and the electric charge and current. And it turns out
that's going to be the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations. So now all we have to do is unfold and
simplify this equation. Think of it like a Rubik's cube. You know, it's all scrambled up, but we just got
to make it clean. And when we clean it up, we'll find the Maxwell's equations that we're looking for
and a bonus surprise equation, which I'll tell you about in a moment. All right. Well, we've got no
other choice than to start to evaluate this derivatives with the F terms. And it's like,
okay, well, we can apply the product rule and we're going to go ahead and break up that derivative.
So first we're going to let the derivative act on the downstairs Faraday tensor, and we're going to
multiply that by the upstairs Faraday tensor. And then for the second term, we're going to have
the downstairs Faraday tensor multiplied by the derivative acting on the upstairs Faraday tensor.
So that's like your standard application of the product rule. While we're at it, let's go ahead
and multiply everything by negative 16 pi, just to scoot that constant on over to the right side of
the equation. And okay, so what should we do next? Well, if you look at these two terms, the derivative of
the F and the F and the F times the derivative of the F, these two terms actually look like kind of
like the same thing, right? I mean, one of them is derivative of downstairs times upstairs,
and one of them is downstairs times derivative of upstairs. But as it turns out, these actually
are identical. The reason being that the only difference between the downstairs and the
upstairs, that is the covariance and the contravariance, is just the minus sign on some
of the terms. And when you multiply the upstairs and the downstairs Faraday tensors, you get the
same thing, whether you do the downstairs first, then the upstairs, or the upstairs first,
then the downstairs. The point there is that the derivative isn't going to change that fundamental
fact, because the derivative operator isn't going to change the signs of any of the components
asymmetrically, depending on whether it's covariant or contravariant. So that's all good. So what that
means is that we can go ahead and let those terms absorb into the same term. It doesn't matter which
one we pick, we'll just pick the first one, because why not? And then we pick up a factor of two
on the outside of that equation. So they just merge together. Alright, well we're getting
somewhere, but we still have this very complicated thing. Partial derivative of the Faraday tensor
with respect to the partial derivatives of the four potential times the Faraday tensor. Oh my gosh.
What have we gotten ourselves into? What do we do to deserve this, you know? Are we put on this
earth just to suffer? Ugh. But we're in too deep now, we can't quit. We're actually almost at the end
of the derivation. So bear with me here. Well first of all, might as well go ahead and divide by two.
So the two goes away, and the sixteen pi becomes eight pi. And now what we want to do is let's go
ahead and get rid of the Faraday tensor term in the derivative. And instead we're going to write
that explicitly in terms of partial derivatives of the four potential a. Because remember, that's all
the Faraday tensor is. It's made completely out of the six ways that a can manifest without violating
the phase symmetry of the Dirac equation, you know? And so therefore, to take the derivative
of the Faraday tensor, all we're doing is taking the derivatives of the derivatives, and then there's a
minus sign because there's another derivative because the Faraday tensor is a derivative minus a
derivative. You know, it's hard to say, but you see what it is, right? Okay. But now the problem is,
we have quite a predicament here, because we still have an equation involving alpha, beta, mu, and nu.
And so each of these terms that involve all four of those letters actually represent 256 terms.
I think 256, because what, you got 4 times 4, that's 16 times 4, 64 times 4, 256. Yeah, so each one of these
terms is actually 256 terms. Now, nu is any possibility. So remember, we have four channels in nu,
but mu, alpha, and beta, we're all summing over. So think of this as four equations in parallel,
or a four-vector equation, if you like. But then within each of those equations, all of these terms
involving the alpha, the beta, the mu, the nu, each of those is going to be 64 terms per equation.
So, you know, if you're one of those people like me, where the first time you see the Einstein
summation convention, you think, oh, this is kind of cryptic and burdensome. Well, I hope now you see
the mess that it saves us from. Imagine writing that all out by hand. No, there's no way. Okay.
Anyway, how do we actually solve this? Well, here is some very good news.
This term, the derivative of the partial derivative with respect to the other partial derivative,
this is almost always zero. I think like 15 out of 16 times it's zero. Because the thing is,
if you take the partial derivative of a partial derivative with respect to another partial
derivative, it's just like before. Remember when you had the partial derivative of one component of
a with respect to another component of a? Usually there's no connection there. That's zero. They don't
depend on each other. They're different independent things, right? And the only way that's not the case
is if you're taking the partial derivative of a partial derivative with respect to the other
partial derivative that is in fact itself. I don't know if that makes sense. Anything you take the
partial derivative with respect to itself is one. And so what that means is that there are a few cases
where this partial derivative is one, and that is when alpha equals mu and beta equals nu. Because then
on both sides of this partial derivative, it's the same thing. It's the derivative of a thing with
respect to itself. So what effect does that have on the equation? Well, just like we saw when evaluating
the left-hand side of the Euler-Lagrange equation and the partial derivative term deleted everything
except for the nu component, well here what it's going to do is this complicated partial derivative
term is just going to delete everything except for the mu nu component on the left term. Or on the
right term, you see the betas and alphas are switched, so that one is going to delete everything
except for the nu mu component. But in either case, at the end of the day, look how wonderfully simple
these become. The partial derivative just vanishes, and it also takes out with it a lot of the different
possibilities for alpha and beta. We see now that they're just mu and nu. And so finally now we're
back down to an equation with only two of these indices, so we don't have to worry about all the
crazy combinatorial explosion that we had to deal with earlier. Now the equation actually simplifies
quite a bit. And now we can actually go ahead and simplify this further, because remember that the
Faraday tensor is defined as just the partial derivative of this component of A with respect
to that component of spacetime, minus the partial derivative of that component of A with respect
to this component of spacetime. And so if you switch mu and nu around, then you can see that f nu mu
is the same as just negative f mu nu. In other words, the tensor is anti-symmetric. So what that means is
that if we have f mu nu minus f nu mu, we can absorb those together and write that as 2 f mu nu. Now we're
getting something really nice. I mean this is, like, very elegant. But we can clean it up just a little bit
by dividing by 2. This, my friends, brings us to the equation that we were seeking. This is a beautiful,
profound equation. It's one of my favorite equations of all time. And why is that, you might ask? Because
this one equation is actually both of the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations. It's both
Gauss's law for electricity and Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition. But look, it's like one equation.
It's beautiful. And don't worry, we're going to unpack that in a second. I'm not going to leave you
hanging. But I just want to linger on this for just a moment and point out the fact that not only have
we accomplished what we set out to accomplish, that is, deriving the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations,
but we did it in a way that unifies them into a more elegant equation, which is very nice,
very deep. So in one equation we get Gauss's law for electricity, but we also get Ampere's law with
Maxwell's addition. Amazing. But wait, there's more. If this equation also implies that electric charge
is locally conserved. I mean, it's like, whoa. So this is why we do variational calculus. The pain
is worth it, because it's such a powerful method, and it gives us such beautiful results.
Okay, so let's go ahead and unpack this equation.
So this equation we just derived, it's actually four different equations in one. One equation
for each value of nu. Or another way of thinking about it is, this is a four-vector equation.
And as it turns out, the nu equals zero component of this equation is Gauss's law for electricity.
And now all we have to do is translate this equation into the language of derivatives and charge
and electric fields and all that stuff. So I'm going to put all this information here,
just for reference, so that we can refer to this while doing this translation.
So first of all, let's go ahead and expand the equation, and write out each one of those terms.
Now right away, we notice there's this term involving F00, and that's going to equal zero,
because if you look at the Faraday tensor, F00 is zero. So that term goes away.
What we're left with is this sum over derivatives of F10, F20, and F30. And first, if we look at this
term involving partial 1, F10, we see that partial 1 is the derivative with respect to x, and F10 is
the x component of the electric field. So therefore, that term becomes the partial derivative of the
electric field with respect to x. Likewise, for the next term, we have the partial derivative in y,
acting on the y component of the electric field. So we end up with the partial derivative of the
y component of the electric field with respect to y. And you can probably see where this is going,
because the third term we're going to have the partial derivative of the z component of the electric
field with respect to z. Now on the right hand side of the equation, we recognize that j0
is the speed of light times the charge density rho. So when we plug that into the equation,
the speed of light cancels out with the 1 over speed of light, and we end up with 4pi times the
charge density. Now all we have to do is recognize that the left hand side of this equation is the
definition of the divergence of the electric field, and we can write this equation as the divergence of
the electric field equals 4pi times the electric charge density. And that is none other than
Gauss's law for electricity. Wow, what a deal. It's all coming together. So now we've got three
Maxwell's equations. By the way, this equation you can also write in integral form using the same math
that we saw earlier with Gauss's law for magnetism. Just apply the divergence theorem and you'll end up
writing it in integral form. Alright, so now we've got three out of the four Maxwell's equations.
And to get the last equation, all we have to do now is look at the nu equals 1, 2, and 3 components.
So here we're going to have three equations in parallel. And if you like, you can think about
this as an equation involving three vectors. And the way I've written it here emphasizes the
three vector perspective. Now let's go ahead and look at this term partial mu f mu 1. And just go
ahead and expand that out. Unpacking the Einstein summation convention and just expanding it as a
sum over the different possibilities for mu. And you get partial 0 f 0 1 plus dot dot dot. And right away,
we see that one of those terms is f 1 1. And if we look at the Faraday tensor, we see that f 1 1 equals 0.
So that term goes away, which is nice. And then if we follow the same procedure for that second
component, the partial mu f mu 2. Again, we expand it as a sum over the different possibilities for mu.
And now we find that there is a term including f 2 2, which is 0. So that term cancels out.
Finally, we're going to go ahead and write out that third component partial mu f mu 3. Expand that as a
sum over the different possibilities for mu. And we see that the f 3 3 component cancels out.
Now then, if we take that top equation, and we expand each of those partial derivative f terms
in terms of the sums that we've just written out, we can write out this equation with a vector on one
side and a vector on the other side. And here again, we can use the definition of the four
gradient as well as the Faraday tensor to translate this into an equation involving derivatives of
different components of the electric and magnetic fields. First of all, if you look at the derivative
terms, you can see that partial 0 is 1 over c partial t. Likewise, partial 1 is partial x,
partial 2 is partial y, and partial 3 is partial z. And then if you look at the various components of
the Faraday tensor that start with 0, so f 0 1, f 0 2, f 0 3, you'll see there the negative components
of the electric field. And if you look at the terms that don't start with 0, so f 2 1, f 3 1,
f 1 2, f 3 2, f 1 3, f 2 3, you see that these are the components of the magnetic field, and some of
them have a minus sign, and some of them don't. So now on the left side of the equation, we have this
vector involving a whole bunch of derivatives of components of the electric and magnetic fields.
Let's go ahead and separate that out into a vector with just the magnetic stuff, and a vector
with just the electric stuff. And now if you look at that magnetic term, you'll recognize that as
the curl of the magnetic field b. And if you look at the electric term, you'll recognize that as
negative 1 over c times the time derivative of the electric field e. And what do you know,
sure enough, this is Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition. Wow. And that brings us to 4 out of 4
Maxwell's equations. And by the way, if you want to convert this to the integral form, you can use
the same methods that we used for Faraday's law of induction. Well, okay, you know what,
now we have actually done something very profound. And if you've made it this far in the video,
you should be proud of yourself because you've leveled up. Because now you know where Maxwell's
equations come from. You don't have to take it on faith anymore. You don't have to say,
okay, these are like these sacred equations that I just have to believe. No. Well, okay, you still have
to believe in local phase symmetry at the Dirac field, but that's like one thing. And now you see
where these four things come from. So philosophically, this is the next level. You know, I know in our
culture, it's kind of fashionable to think of physics as like this dry, boring, esoteric, sterile endeavor.
But this is actually a thoroughly shamanic exercise. Like when you really incorporate this
math and these ideas into your worldview, it's amazing. You're like, wow, all these different
electromagnetic phenomena arise from this simple principle. Like are we living in a kaleidoscope?
I mean, what is going on here? Why? It's like, oh, I'm at a loss for words. So that's my cue to move
on to the next topic. Oh, I almost forgot. So in addition to the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations,
the same equation that we just derived with the partial mu f mu nu equals 4 pi over c j nu,
well, it's kind of a tongue twister. Well, anyway, it also implies that electric charge is locally
conserved. And local charge conservation is just the idea that the rate of change of charge density
somewhere in space is going to be balanced by the divergence of currents at that location in space.
This actually has a very intuitive interpretation. All this is to say that if you want to remove
charge from some location, it has to flow out of that location. Or conversely, if you want the amount
of charge somewhere to increase, it has to flow in to make it increase. So you can think of local
charge conservation as a way of saying that charge cannot teleport. And what's really neat is if you
look at our relativistic notation, we can write this a lot more simply as partial nu j nu equals 0.
And here, because nu appears twice, we're summing over that term. So in other words, partial 0 j 0 plus
partial 1 j 1 plus partial 2 j 2 plus partial 3 j 3 equals 0. So that's just another way of writing
the condition of local charge conservation. And you'll notice that this is a Lorenz invariant
property. All inertial observers are going to agree that this quantity is 0 because the expression
combines the covariant 4 gradient with the contravariant current. So to prove that electric
charge is locally conserved, we just have to prove that partial nu j nu equals 0. And to do that,
we can take our equation. And now what we want to do is we want to substitute that j nu into the
equation partial nu j nu and see if it actually does equal 0. So when we write out partial nu j nu,
we can write that as partial nu c over 4 pi partial mu f mu nu. So many mu's and nu's, it's hard to say.
Anyway, so we can pull out the c over 4 pi as a constant. And now what we have is the derivative of a
derivative of an f mu nu. And because both nu and mu are repeated in this term,
this expression is actually a sum over all of those different indices.
So we're going to have 16 terms here. And each one of those 16 terms is going to have the form
of a second derivative of a component of the Faraday tensor. And as it turns out, because the
order of the differentiation doesn't matter. And because of the antisymmetry of the Faraday tensor,
that is because f mu nu equals negative f mu mu, these 16 terms are all going to cancel out in pairs,
and the result is going to be 0. So for example, consider the case where nu and mu can be 0 and 1,
or 1 and 0. In that case, you have two terms depending on which one is 1 and which one is 0.
And you can look at that as partial 0 partial 1 f10 plus partial 1 partial 0 f01.
But because partial 0 partial 1 has the same effect as partial 1 partial 0,
and because f01 equals negative f10, we can write the second term there simply as negative
partial 0 partial 1 f10, which cancels out with the first term, and so you end up with 0.
And if you try that with all the different combinations of mu and nu, you'll see that
they'll all cancel out in pairs. And so yes, in fact, this expression is 0, and therefore,
electric charge is locally conserved. Now this derivation is interesting. It's sort of an
implicit constraint, you know, because we set out to say, okay, we have some psi, and we're going
to calculate what must be true about A in order to relax the QED Lagrangian for that psi.
So it's a little bit strange that what we have now is actually a constraint on j,
which because j is born of psi, that's also a constraint on psi. This constraint is required in
order for the consistency of these equations to all hold together, you know. And from our current
viewpoint, this might seem like something of a mysterious result. But if you're interested,
you can derive this from scratch using global U1 phase symmetry of the Dirac field as the continuous
symmetry and plugging that into Noether's theorem. And that'll give you a proof that probability for
current is conserved. But it's philosophically the same basic thing. So well, anyway, I just mentioned
that in passing. But yeah, that's another cool result is that electric charge must be locally
conserved. All right, so we've come a long way. Now we've got all the Maxwell's equations,
and we've even got local charge conservation. But we still haven't yet derived the Lorenz force law.
So let's do that. All right, well, so to derive the Lorenz force law,
all we have to do is apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to a relativistic particle that is
immersed in the 4 potential. Now for this derivation, we're going to take as a starting point
the Euler-Lagrange equation for a relativistic particle, as well as the Lagrangian for a
relativistic particle in a 4 potential. And from these principles, we're going to be able to derive
the Lorenz force law. But first, let me say a few words about where these principles come from.
All right, let me put this little note down here. So tau is the particle's proper time,
that is, the time as measured by the particle. And x mu is the contravariant 4 position,
so x mu as a function of tau represents the particle's path through spacetime. And if you
take the total derivative of x mu with respect to tau, that gives you the particle's 4 velocity,
and we're going to write that as u mu. Griffith uses eta for the 4 velocity, but we'll use u.
Either one is fine. So if you're interested in the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the
relativistic particle, you can pause the video here and explore this in detail. But I'm just going to
gloss over this for now for a couple of reasons. First of all, this derivation is remarkably similar to
what we've already done for the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations. It relies on the same basic
concept of putting nudges on the equations and integrating and integrating my parts and taking
out the boundary terms. And anyway, at the end of the day, remember how the Euler-Lagrange equation
is like a microscopic version of the macroscopic principle of least action. So, you know, in
physics you often just start with the Euler-Lagrange equation, and it's understood that this comes out
of the principle of least action. So we're just going to go ahead and start off with the Euler-Lagrange
equation, and in the interest of time we're not going to reiterate the process that gets you from
the principle of least action to the Euler-Lagrange equation. Okay then, moving on to the Lagrangian,
let's first take a look at the mass term. So the mass term in the Lagrangian is going to be
negative one-half m times u nu, u nu. And what that is is just negative one-half times the mass
times this Lorenz invariant quantity that has to do with the four velocity of the particle.
Now to derive this in a rigorous way is actually surprisingly complicated and tedious,
especially in the form that I'm currently showing it in with this quadratic form in the one-half.
There's a lot of nuance and details behind there, and I worry that we'd go off on too much of a
tangent if I try to derive that here. So let me just say a few things in passing.
The first is that this mass term is about as simple as it can possibly be. You know, there's,
I mean, if you look at what it's made out of, there's a factor of m, which okay, yeah,
we expect a factor of m, and then there's a Lorenz invariant quantity, u nu, u nu,
made out of the four velocity, and okay, so that kind of makes sense too. By the way,
that quantity equals the speed of light squared. But it's worthwhile to write it out in this form,
so that we can derive equations of motion from the Lagrangian. Okay, well anyway,
if you're curious about where this term comes from, there's actually a really good Wikipedia page
called Relativistic Lagrangian Mechanics, and that goes into a lot more detail,
so check that out if you're interested. But for now, let's just go ahead and accept that term,
and we'll notice also it bears no resemblance to the Lorenz force law, so even if you're a little
skeptical of where does this come from, well, it doesn't have like e plus v cross b in there,
so we're not like sneaking in the Lorenz force law. So I hope it's not too unsatisfying that I didn't
provide a rigorous derivation of this term right now. Okay, well, but to make it up to you,
I will provide a decently rigorous derivation of where the interaction term in the Lagrangian comes
from. So to get this term, what we do is we start off with the interaction term in the Lagrangian
density of quantum electrodynamics, and as we've seen, that term is just negative q,
psi bar gamma nu psi, a nu. Now if we write that in terms of the four current, which is j nu equals
cq psi bar gamma nu psi, then we can write the interaction term of the QED Lagrangian as negative
one over c, j nu a nu. And now what we have to do is we have to take this to the classical limit in
the sense of localizing the particle, zooming out, thinking about like the big picture of, okay,
we're in some place, and there's some four potential, and relative to the changes in the
four potential, our particle is very small and very localized. And so if we want to get the Lagrangian,
that is the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime, for the interaction term, all we have
to do is integrate over space, this one over c j nu a nu. Now while we're doing that, we can notice,
well, okay, negative one over c, that's a constant, pull that outside the integral. But also,
because the particle is going to be sharply localized, the four potential is not going to
vary from one side of the particle to the other, right? If we're dealing with basically a point
particle, then there's just going to be some value of a nu there. And so we can pop the a nu outside
of the integral as well. Then if you think about what it means to integrate the four current over
some volume of space, you see that that ends up being just the charge of the particle times its four
velocity. And so if we put the expression q u nu into the equation, we end up with the interaction
term for the Lagrangian of negative q over c u nu a nu. And so here we can see that this interaction
term does follow directly from the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics. And that's really the
important thing, right? Philosophically, if we want to show that electromagnetism comes out of local
phase symmetry, we want to use all of the ideas we've developed so far. And in particular, if we're
wondering how the electric and magnetic fields are going to push around a charged particle,
then it's important that at least for sure the interaction term that we're using in our Lagrangian
is going to be the classical limit of the interaction term in the Lagrangian density of
quantum electrodynamics. All right, well, let's go ahead and solve the Euler-Lagrange equation,
first by evaluating the left hand side. On that side of the equation, we have the partial derivative of
the Lagrangian with respect to the four position. And if we plug in the Lagrangian, we can write
that as the partial derivative with respect to x mu of the Lagrangian, which contains a mass term
and also an interaction term. By the way, sometimes you'll see the Lagrangian multiplied through by a
minus sign so that these terms are both positive. You'll see that in some derivations. And that's
doable because imagine if you multiply your Lagrangian globally by some constant, that's not going to
change anything about the governing equations that the Lagrangian gives you, because when you optimize
it, a global scale constant is just going to wash out, it doesn't have any effect on anything. So
but anyway, we'll just go ahead and keep the minus signs in for simplicity. All right, well,
now to evaluate this expression, first, let's go ahead and start off with the mass term that I've
highlighted here in orange. We'll make the observation that the partial derivative of the
particle's covariant four velocity with respect to the contravariant position is zero. And notice
in this expression, the one half and the m are constants. So they're just going to multiply the
derivative. So when you think about this derivative, you can ignore those, they are not really relevant
or interesting. And when you take the derivative of the rest of the expression, bear in mind that the
four velocity here is to be evaluated as a function of tau, the proper time. And so the partial derivative
with respect to x mu is actually going to be zero. All right, and now if we shift our attention over to
the interaction term, which I've highlighted in green, we can see that when we take a derivative
with respect to x mu, q over c, that's a constant, of course, but also u nu as a function of tau is going
to be a constant relative to the partial derivative of x mu. And so we can write that expression as q
over c u nu partial a nu partial x mu. So at the end of the day, what we end up getting for this
expression is that the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to x mu is negative q over
c times u nu partial a nu partial x mu. So that is the left hand side of the Euler Lagrange equation.
Moving on over to the right hand side, we want to take the total derivative with respect to the
proper time of the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the four velocity.
So let's plug in the definition of the Lagrangian. And once again, we'll focus first on the mass term,
and then we'll focus on the interaction term. And first, we'll evaluate the derivative with respect
to the four velocity, and never mind for the moment the derivative with respect to tau. So evaluating the
derivative with respect to the four velocity of the mass term, we recognize that negative one
half m is a constant. So we pull that out. And then the term u nu u nu, we're going to go ahead
and split that up using the product rule. And at this point, I'll just go ahead and drop the
parentheses as a function of tau. Now if we look at the interaction term, when we take the derivative
relative to the four velocity, we see that negative q over c is going to be a constant that comes out of
the derivative. And we also notice that a nu as a function of x is going to be a constant relative to
the partial derivative with respect to u mu. And so that's going to come out as well as a constant.
And finally, the u nu term, that's going to stay in the derivative. And so we end up with the partial
derivative of u nu with respect to u mu. Okay, now if we look back to the mass term, let's go ahead and
evaluate the expression that we got as a result of the product rule. And we'll notice here that these
two terms look very, very similar. And also the partial derivative looks like one of those things
where it's either zero or one. And so it's going to turn off most of the indices except one. And so
yeah, if you look at the partial derivative, it turns out that the partial derivative of u nu with
respect to u mu is going to be one only when nu equals mu. And so therefore that whole expression
reduces to the specific case of u mu. Alright, and likewise, the same thing is exactly true when it
comes to the other term. But here, let's go ahead and switch the indices around. So we have an upstairs
u nu times the derivative of the downstairs u nu. And we can just go ahead and switch those around.
So instead, we can have the downstairs u nu times the derivative of the upstairs u nu. Because in
both cases, the minus signs end up working out the same way. And then here we have the same expression
as before. And so we recognize that as u mu. So in that expression, in this sum of the green and the
orange terms, we end up having two u mu. So we multiply that through, it cancels out the one half,
we pull the negative sign outside the time derivative, and we end up with the negative
time derivative of m times u mu, plus something plus the interaction something. So what is that
interaction something? So if we examine this derivative, we also see a partial derivative of
u nu with respect to u mu. And that's usually going to be zero, but it'll be one when u equals mu. And so
that term has the effect of converting that expression into simply q over c a mu. Alright,
so we're getting somewhere, the equation is starting to simplify. So here, let's go ahead
and recognize the term mu mu as the kinetic for momentum, p mu. And now let's go ahead and split
out these terms and the derivatives. So we'll start off with the negative derivative of the momentum
with respect to the proper time, minus whatever happens when we apply the derivative to the
interaction term. So let's go ahead and do that. Well, first of all, the q over c, that purple term,
that's a constant. So that's going to be on the outside of the derivative. And the real question
is, what is the derivative of a mu with respect to the proper time of the particle? Now here,
this is tricky because it's not the partial derivative of a mu with respect to time. What
it is, is the total amount of change of a mu that the particle sees as it's moving through space time.
And so to calculate this total derivative with respect to the proper time, we have to imagine from
the particle's point of view, what changes does it see as its clock ticks forward. And so what that
proper time derivative is going to be, is the product of the partial derivative of a mu with
respect to x nu times the total derivative of x nu with respect to tau. And by the way,
I know you're not supposed to pretend that derivatives are fractions, but if you pretend it's a fraction,
this kind of makes sense, you know? Well, anyway, we can recognize the total derivative of x nu with respect to
tau as the definition of the four velocity u nu. And therefore, we can write this expression,
having taken the total proper time derivative as q over c partial a mu partial x nu times u nu.
So now that we have the left hand side and the right hand side of the Euler Lagrange equations,
we can stick them together. And now if you look at it, you can kind of parse it up and see like,
what are the different things in this equation? We've got some q over c's, we've got some u nu's,
we've got some partial derivatives and stuff. And so we can write this equation in a cleaner way.
We can move the blue term over to the left and the yellow term over to the right and factor out
the orange term and factor out the purple term. And we end up with an expression for the total
derivative of the kinetic four momentum with respect to the proper time in terms of charge and in terms
of partial derivatives of a and in terms of the four velocity of the particle. So that's cool. That
really feels like we're getting to the Lorentz force law. That feels like we're on the right track.
And you know, what's really neat is check this out. So look at that term in the brackets. We have
partial mu a nu minus partial mu a mu. Well, that's just our good old friend, the Faraday tensor,
f mu nu. So we can write this equation as q over c f mu nu u nu. Wait, hold up q over c f mu nu u.
Man, this is tough to say. q over c f mu nu me nu. Okay. So it ends up being just the charge of the
particle divided by the speed of light times the field strength tensor multiplied by the four velocity
of the particle. And as it turns out, this is the Lorentz force law in relativistic notation.
And of course, we're going to unpack this in a second. But before we do, I just want to emphasize the
simplicity of this equation. What we have on the left side is basically a time derivative of
momentum. So that's like the definition of force. And what we have on the right side is kind of the
simplest thing it could be. I mean, there's a factor of charge, there's a speed of light to make
the units make sense. There's the field strength tensor, which is, you know, a relatively simple
object that we can make out of the various ingredients of our theory. And we also have the
four velocity of the particle, you know, so this is not like some crazy complicated equation.
And also, it's more elegant than what you normally see for the Lorentz force law,
where you have that term with the electric field and the cross product between velocity
and the magnetic field. And it's like, what's going on there? And what are these fields? And why
does velocity come into the picture? It's like, okay, in the relativistic version of the equation,
these kinds of questions don't really come up. It's more like, oh, wow, look at this neat little
elegant result. So anyway, what we have here is yet another example of relativistic notation,
making the laws of electromagnetism look a lot more concise and elegant and unified.
Okay, so now we're going to see how the Lorentz force law pops out of this relativistic equation,
dp mu d tau equals q over c f mu nu f nu nu nu nu nu nu nu. So first, what we'll do is,
let's go ahead and expand that term involving the f's and the mu's and nu's and u's. And we'll just
write that out as a sum over each possibility for nu, because those indices are repeated,
so we're summing over nu. And you can see that what we have here is an equation for the muth
component of the proper time derivative of the four momentum. So let me put a bunch of stuff here
for reference. And we'll go ahead and translate this into an equation about forces in x, y, and z.
First off, let's go ahead and consider the mu equals one component of the equation.
So we just write out the equation and we replace mu with one. Now if we look at all the stuff on
the right, we can see that those Faraday tensor terms are going to be an electric field and a zero
and some magnetic field terms. And the components of the four velocity are going to be the Lorentz
factor gamma times speed of light for the time component and negative velocity components for the
one, two, and three components. And the minus sign comes from the fact that this is the covariant
four velocity. Okay, so if you substitute those into the equation, we get the equation shown here,
and I've gone ahead and pulled out the Lorentz factor outside of the equation to clean it up a
little bit. And now what we're going to do is we're going to pull the gamma factor, that Lorentz factor,
over to the left hand side of the equation. So we're going to have one over gamma times the derivative
of the x component of the momentum with respect to the proper time. And then if we write out all these
blue terms and clean it up a little bit, we see that that equals some expression involving electric
and magnetic fields and components of the velocity. So this is looking very promising, I think we're on
the right track. Now to make sense of this equation, we have to use the fact that a differential step in
coordinate time is going to be the Lorentz factor gamma times a differential step in the proper time.
And if we make that substitution into the left hand side of this equation,
we get an expression for the derivative of the x component of momentum with respect to
the coordinate time, which is exactly the force in the x direction on the particle.
So that's awesome, it's like this is the moment of truth, we're finally going to see if we get the
right force. So now take the right hand side of that equation, go ahead and distribute through a 1
over c, so that's going to cancel out the c on the ex, and that's going to give us a 1 over c on
the magnetic and velocity terms. And then we're going to recognize bzvy minus byvz,
that is the x component of the cross product of the velocity and the magnetic field, just by pattern
matching, right, just by looking at the definition of the cross product. And so this is indeed the x
component of the Lorentz force law. Wow, we've done it. Well, okay, let's just make sure. So let's repeat
the argument with the mu equals 2 component, and we can see that with exactly the same reasoning,
we can derive the y component of the force. And yes, indeed, that ends up being the y component
of the Lorentz force law. Okay, so two out of three, I really think this is going to be the
Lorentz force law. Let's go to mu equals 3. And again, same exact reasoning. And as you can see,
if you follow through these equations, yep, we end up with the z component of the Lorentz force law.
Now we pull these all together into a vector. And what do you know, there it is, the Lorentz force
law, derived from local phase symmetry of the Dirac field. Wow, how good does it feel to finally
get the Maxwell's equations, that's one thing, but now also the Lorentz force law, that pretty much
completes the big picture of showing how you want symmetry gives rise to electromagnetism. So
man, it feels good to finally get to this point in the video. Okay, hey, well, before we wrap up,
there's a couple of miscellaneous things I wanted to say that didn't really fit into the flow of the
video, but are kind of interesting little tangents. So I want to mention those briefly.
And I want to talk about some mysteries too, while we're here. Because you know,
physics is not done yet, there are still open questions and problems and mysteries.
And it's important to reflect on those too. And you know, now that we've done all this math and stuff,
we're in a really good position to wax philosophical about what it all means.
So we'll do that for a few minutes before we get going here.
So in this video, I have intentionally avoided the topic of the covariant derivative. But I know that
if I don't mention it, at least in passing, I'm going to get a million comments like,
hey, why didn't you talk about the covariant derivative? Like, how can you talk about gauge
theory without talking about the covariant derivative? So okay, let me just say a couple
of words about it. First of all, I think that when you're first getting into electromagnetism as a
gauge theory, you should not worry about the covariant derivative. This is a concept that I think
hides more than it simplifies. And when you're trying to get oriented in all of this and kind of
feel your way around and get familiar with stuff. In my opinion, the covariant derivative is kind of
a cryptic thing that doesn't give you a ton of benefits until later on, especially if you're
thinking in terms of fiber bundles and really getting into it. But at first, it's not super
useful in my opinion. Well, anyway, it is something you should be aware of. And the idea is basically
just to redefine the derivative operator relative to the 4 potential. So you can say that capital D
mu is just going to be partial mu plus i times q over h bar c a mu. And when you do this, then you
can write the QED Lagrangian in a simpler way, where you have a capital D instead of a partial,
and you don't have to explicitly write the interaction term because it's been absorbed
into the definition of the covariant derivative. Anyway, look, take it or leave it. You don't have to
use it if you don't want to. I like to write out the interaction term. But I can see if you're working
with fiber bundles or something where like, the interaction term is kind of unnecessary to write,
and you want to think about it in a more elegant way. Okay, I get it. I'm not look, I'm not hating
on the covariant derivative. I'm just saying, it's kind of optional, at least from an introductory
perspective. So okay. Oh, I have to say a few words about the gauge invariance of the 4 potential
and how it relates to the local phase symmetry of psi. So you know, in classical electromagnetism,
if you have some electric field and some magnetic field, the 4 potential can be modified while still
describing the same situation. So it's kind of redundant, like there can be multiple different
4 potentials that correspond to the same electric and magnetic fields. So you know, the classic example
is that voltage can be raised or lowered by some uniform amount without changing anything. Because
you can define ground to be whatever you want it to be, right? So what matters is the change in voltage
from one place to another, it's not really the absolute voltage itself. So that is like a classic
example of gauge invariance. But that concept can be generalized. And actually, if you take the 4
potential, you can add to it, the 4 gradient of any arbitrary scalar field, you can have a scalar
field lambda that's flopping around arbitrarily. And you can show using the definitions of E and B
in terms of derivatives of A, that this is in fact the case. And one of the questions you have
when you first learn electromagnetism is Y. Like that's weird, that the 4 potential is loose like
that, you know, it's like, where does that come from? But from the perspective of gauge theory,
we can see that it comes directly from the local phase symmetry of psi. So for example,
if you multiply psi by E to the i theta, where theta is some function of spacetime, then as we've seen
earlier in the video, the 4 potential is going to have to transform and pick up a factor of negative
h bar c over q times the 4 gradient of theta. But let's go ahead and absorb negative h bar c over
q times theta simply as lambda, because that's just a scalar, right? So then the transformation is
A mu becomes A mu plus the 4 gradient of lambda. But that's exactly what the gauge invariance or the
gauge freedom of the 4 potential is anyway. And so the lesson there is that the gauge freedom in
the 4 potential that you learn about in classical electromagnetism is literally just the same thing
as the local phase symmetry in psi viewed from the point of view of A. So that's like one more thing
that's not a mystery if you start with the perspective of local phase symmetry. You see
that it's just like how it is. So now I'd like to talk about the mystery of the fine structure constant.
So one thing that gauge theory doesn't tell us at all is why q should have the value it has,
right? Why the charge should have the value it has. Now it's a little bit subtle and nuanced,
because from a purely symmetry oriented perspective, we can say, well, naturally,
wouldn't it make sense if q was one? And then we just had some weird constant on the photon's
kinetic contribution to the Lagrangian. But then you see that it's the same mystery,
because then the question becomes, well, why does that constant have the value it has?
But at the end of the day, the mysterious ratio is the ratio between the strength of the
electromagnetic interaction, and the energy of a photon. And so one really clean way to look at this
ratio is to just make a fraction. And on top, you put the energy required to overcome the electrostatic
repulsion of two electrons. So if you bring them together from infinitely far away, and you pull them
together to some distance d, then the energy required to do that in Gaussian units is q squared over d.
And then we're going to divide that energy by the energy of a single photon whose wavelength
is two pi times that distance. Or in other words, the angular wavelength is the distance
that we've brought the electrons together. And the energy of that given by the Planck relation
is hc over lambda. And so when you simplify this, you end up with q squared over h bar c in Gaussian units.
In SI units, you also have a 4 pi epsilon naught, but that's okay. Regardless of your system of units,
when you calculate the value of that expression, you get a constant. And the constant is this weird,
mysterious number that has no units. It's just 0.0072973525643, although usually people remember
the value of its reciprocal, which is about 137.035 something. But what nobody knows is where does this
number come from? What determines this number? Why is it what it is? Why is electromagnetism as strong
as it is? No one knows. And look, don't just take my word for it. Let's hear what Dirac has to say.
There is the problem of explaining the fine structure constant, the number 137, which plays
an important role in physics. And the question is, why should it be 137 instead of some other number?
That has not been explained at all. And I feel that it is necessary to get an explanation of that
before one will make an important advance in understanding atomic theory.
So now that we've seen that local phase symmetry gives rise to electromagnetism,
we can ask the question of what happens if we break local phase symmetry? And so for example,
this is what happens in a superconductor. But don't worry, it's not as destructive as it sounds.
Actually, the local U1 phase symmetry still applies to the laws of physics in the superconductor,
but the superconducting ground state is going to pick out a phase and thereby effectively break
the symmetry. And as a result, you have photons acquiring an effective mass via the Anderson-Higgs
mechanism. Consequently, magnetic fields become expelled, and you get the Meissner effect,
and you get lossless flow of currents without any resistance that can persist indefinitely.
And it's like, pretty crazy stuff. So, but that's like the exception that proves the rule,
right? So if we've seen how local phase symmetry blossoms into electromagnetism,
you can understand how breaking local U1 phase symmetry is going to break electromagnetism,
and you can do a lot of cool stuff with that. So we'll talk about that in a future video,
and we'll explore symmetry and superconductors. And then going the other way, as it turns out,
our universe is kind of broken, because the U1 symmetry of electromagnetism is just a fragment
of a more primordial, more general symmetry that electromagnetism used to have back in the good old
days. By good old days, I mean the first picosecond after the Big Bang, before the Higgs field done went
and took on a non-zero-vev. Well, anyway, you know, ever since then, it's sort of like our entire universe
has been 75% superconducting, and a superconductor gets you the final 25% to become 100% superconducting.
But the three quarters superconducting nature of our reality is manifest in the fact that
three of the four original electromagnetic or technically electroweak bosons have now acquired
mass in much the same way that photons acquire mass in a superconductor. And so those are now known as
the W and Z bosons that mediate the weak nuclear interaction. And meanwhile, the photon which escaped
mass free from the Higgs field is now, you know, responsible for electromagnetism. So that's a trip.
It turns out electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are really two sides of the
same coin. But that's a story for another day. But it's definitely fascinating. And we will return
to that topic someday. Hey, one more philosophical thing I want to leave you with is, when we add
local phase symmetry to the laws of physics, epistemically, are we adding something? Or are
we taking something away? Right? The burden of these ideas, the structure that we're taking for granted,
does that grow as we put in the symmetry? Or does it shrink? Does our model become more contrived or
more elegant? Honestly, I have no idea. I don't know. And think about that for a while. And you'll
realize, wait a minute, symmetry, redundancy, active, passive transformations, what is going on here? Like,
what? And that indeed is the question. What like even is going on here in this universe? Will we ever
know? Hey, thanks for watching. I really appreciate it. This YouTube thing has been a lot of fun. So
thank you all who have been involved. Shout out to my supporters on Patreon, really grateful for all of
you. And I hope you all learned something today. And I hope you all had a great time. So have an
awesome day, and I'll see you in the next one.
