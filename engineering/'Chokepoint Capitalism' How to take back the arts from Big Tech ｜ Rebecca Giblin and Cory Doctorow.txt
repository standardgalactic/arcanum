my name is Nancy Proctor I just want to welcome you all to the Peel and for those of you who
may not have been to the Peel before you can be forgiven we were actually shuttered for 20 years
starting in 1997 and we just recently reopened after five years of renovations so we have
reinvented ourselves as Baltimore's Community Museum but I did want to tell you a little bit
about our past we're the site of many many firsts if you will for the city and for the country this
is the oldest museum building in the Western Hemisphere actually it was opened in 1814 by
Rembrandt Peel back in a time when there were very few museums anywhere in the world and certainly
very few that had been purpose-built to be museums this museum was very eclectic for our times anyway
it exhibited everything from fine art to natural history the first prehistoric animal in the world
was exhibited in a museum here and a companion in the family's Philadelphia Museum and it ran very well
but unfortunately despite the founder having also been dabbling in new technologies he introduced gas
light technology to the city by using it to illuminate his galleries at night eventually
he was invited to create the first gas streetlight network in the country and thereby founded BGE now
known as Baltimore Gas and Electric but then Baltimore Gas and Light Company unfortunately none
of that let alone the museum business was enough to pay back the investors who had paid for the
building of this building so in 1829 Rembrandt and his brother Rubens Peel you can recognize the pattern
in the family naming here there was no question what their father wanted them to grow up to be they
were forced to sell the museum in a fire sale and the city of Baltimore bought it in 1829 and made it
the city's first city hall when the new city hall was built across the street here catty corner to us the
building was repurposed to be male and female colored school number one now we're now in reconstruction era
and the first public schools are being built for blacks in this city school public schools had
been available to white citizens for more than 50 years at this point and when the first schools were
opened they were really only allowed to have elementary school curriculum it was considered
neither necessary nor desirable and that's almost a direct quote for there to be a secondary school of
a education available to people of color in this state thanks however to the activism of Isaac Myers
and the Brotherhood of Liberty and others the city was pressured into adding a secondary school curriculum
and this was the school that had that first high school class that first high school education
available to people of color in the city the school that was founded here quickly outgrew the
building it got a new purpose-built school built called the colored high school by 1894 that school
now is called the Frederick Douglass High School which is one of the most historic high schools in the
country so the very first black teachers who had been public school educated came through this building
because of course you couldn't become a teacher until you had a high school degree so up until that point
even all of the instructors in the black schools were white so it's a place that has had many
transformative moments when the school left this building it started being used for manufacturing of
all sorts and it almost destroyed the building and they were going to in fact tear it down until some
citizens and journalists came together and said no actually this is too an important part of our
history and so they agreed to renovate the building and convert it into Baltimore's first municipal
museum so it opened is that in 1930 and it ran until 1997 when due to another financial crisis the
city shut this museum and several other city-owned museums down and basically abandoned the building
for 20 years so the collection at that time was transferred to what was called the Maryland Historical
Society you can still see it at the Maryland Center for History and Culture but this building is really
the only physical artifact we have left where our collection such as it is is born digital it has
recorded Baltimore stories of the people and the people who use the come to the city and use this
building and we're also a platform and a stage for the city's creators and storytellers in all media so
that might be artists creating exhibitions historians doing workshops or community groups organizing and having
their own events so this is your museum and I really hope you will use it everything that we do here comes
from the community it's driven grassroots up so if there's anything that you'd like to do here at the
Peel don't hesitate to get in touch with us my name is Nancy my contact info is out there and there's my
colleagues will be happy to help you as well one thing that you might want to come back for is on December 3rd
we're having a festive fundraiser it'll be a great party at the Peel so you can pick up one of these
and take them away all right so enough about the history of the Peel I appreciate your letting me give
you all of that I know it's in 208 years you amass a lot of stories it's hard to compress them into a
soundbite so I also want to now very quickly introduce our wonderful speakers here today immediately
here on my left is Maximilian Alvarez whom you might know well as the editor-in-chief of the Real News
Network just two doors down they've been fabulous partners and neighbors for the Peel and have done
a number of events here with us so we were thrilled when Max said he would be available to interview our
other great friends Cory Doctorow and Professor Rebecca Giblin who are visiting here from LA and
Australia respectively you probably don't need much more of an introduction than that so I'm going to
shut up and hand this over to Max thank you thank you for being here all right well geez thank you
all so much for coming out in the cold thank you to Nancy and to everyone here at the Peel for hosting
this incredible event and for doing all the great work that they do please do support them please as
Benancy said make this you know your own space because we need spaces like this and of course thank
you to my amazing interlocutors Cory Doctorow and Rebecca Giblin A for writing such an important book
and B for schlepping across the world spreading the good word and for putting us on your schedule we really
appreciate y'all making it out of here and I do mean it when I say this is a vital book right and the examples for
what Cory and Rebecca talk about in choke point capitalism are everywhere we just got a hilariously and awfully
poignant example this week and now it looks like the Department of Justice is going to be investigating parent company of Ticketmaster on antitrust grounds and it looks like the Department of Justice is going to be
investigating parent company of Ticketmaster on antitrust grounds after hashtag Swiftgate so the the name of the book is choke point capitalism how big tech and big content captured creative labor markets and how we'll win them back I'm gonna read a passage from it in a second but just to sort of frame this for us you know
you know competition we're told is the lifeblood of capitalism right it is the foundation undergirding the entire system upon which you know capitalism depends it is the basis supposedly for the entire social contract that you know we enter into in capitalist society and yet as Cory and Rebecca
you know it is the basis of brilliantly detail in this book as they termed them pathologies endemic to capitalism and to the entire capitalist system naturally and inevitably tend towards concentration towards anti-competition monopoly monopsony exploitation rent seeking so on and so forth right this is where it all heads and again I think we can all feel that on a day to day
a level corporate concentration is on steroids right now record profits are you know across the board in different industries all while workers wages have remained stagnant for decades all while suppliers are being squeezed
So there seems to be one clear group that is making out like bandits in all of this while the rest of us collectively suffer in innumerable ways and I think that the work that Cory and Rebecca have done in this book not only helps us better diagnose this problem but I think in a truly remarkable accomplishment of the book they spend a great deal of time talking about how we get ourselves out of this mess
So as I mentioned in the subtitle to the book they do focus intently on creative labor markets right as we're gonna talk about in a minute
Thank you as the sort of proverbial canaries in the coal mine and and you know as go the creative workers so will go the rest of us I think is is really one of the taglines here and we're gonna understand why
So here's something that Cory and Rebecca write in the final chapter of their book
Quote
Knowledge and culture are vital to human thriving
Art gives expression to new ideas and movements and cultures
Making an experience it can be an act of solidarity or protest
It can sucker our traumas and heightened moments of joy
Music, poetry, fiction, memoir, sculpture, painting, and dance are all necessary to making sense of and bearing being human
We need people to be able to dedicate their professional lives to these crafts
Creative workers and producers deserve a better deal
One that delivers them a dignified and fair share of the wealth generated by their work
We've shown some of the key actions that can get them there like enshrining
Let me skip ahead actually
I didn't want to mark up Nancy's book
So in the ongoing war of capital versus labor between oligarchy and democracy capital is clearly ascendant
Wages in most developed nations have stagnated over the last 40 years through product though productivity has risen steeply
At the same time profit margins and concentrated industries are rising
Anti-competitive flywheels are everywhere
Locking in users and suppliers
Making markets hostile to new entrants
And leveraging that power to force suppliers and workers to accept ever lower prices
We are sharing less in the returns of our work because choke points are sapping our ability to bargain for improved conditions and pay
Monopolies and monopsonies have become endemic squeezing the life out of customers and suppliers
And then there are there are the uncountable corporations who don't quite meet the extraordinarily high standards required by US antitrust law to earn that label
But which also use their control over choke points to siphon away a disproportionate share of value
Particularly from other people's labor
Now, Corey, Rebecca
I don't want to ask you all to kind of rehash, right?
You know the analytical breakdown that you give of what choke point capitalism is, how it came to be, what it looks like
I was hoping in fact that we could start by sort of
You know demonstrating what choke point capitalism is to people by looking at
Different people in this system and how this system affects them, right?
So sticking with some of the examples that we've already mentioned
Let's talk about, you know, your average, you know, Joe Schmo Amazon Prime subscriber
Right, who orders a lot of stuff on Amazon Prime
Who here orders from Amazon Prime?
It's okay, you can be, you can admit it
All right
So let's talk about from the average Amazon customer side
Amazon small vendor who has to use Amazon's marketplace to sell whatever it is that they are producing
And even an Amazon worker at a fulfillment center like the one that we have down the road
And then on the other side, you know, you all do an incredible job talking about
services like Spotify, right?
And what they mean for musicians
And so I was wondering if we could also weave in like if I'm an independent musician trying to get my music out there
Or if I'm someone who listens to Spotify to find new music
To find new music
In those sorts of subject positions, what does choke point capitalism look like?
Do you want to start or shall I?
You start. I'm still writing down all of the, before I forget, all of the ones that we're going to talk about
Well, so Amazon's an interesting example
And it's interesting in part because the DC Attorney General brought a landmark antitrust case against Amazon
So antitrust law, you should understand, doesn't do much
It's been a dead letter for about 40 years
But the one thing that it's supposed to protect us against is high prices
Basically, the posture of antitrust regulators these days is so long as you're not making prices go up
You can form a monopoly that does anything it wants to everybody except for the consumer
And if prices go up, then the regulator will step in
In practice, they rarely do
And it is this very narrow eye of the needle that people keep trying to thread their antitrust cases through
With varying degrees of success, lots of people are arguing that we should have a more expansive view
But in the DC case, they actually just try to thread this one little needle
So if you want to sell on Amazon, if you want to sell goods, you have to sell on Amazon
Because we've got Prime, right?
Once you've got Prime, you're almost certain not to look anywhere except Amazon
If you're trying to buy goods, that you've already spent your $150
So you're definitely going to shop Amazon first if you can get there
So that's all the users being corralled
All the customers being corralled into Amazon's little walled garden there
So the sellers want to be there
But it's not enough to merely sell through Amazon
Because if you're not a Prime seller on Amazon
Then you're not going to show up in the search results
So to be Prime, you have to do things like fulfillment by Amazon
Which means that you've got to send your stuff to Amazon's warehouse to be shipped and so on
And then if you want to show up in the first couple of pages of results
You probably have to pay what they call advertising fees
It's just payola to be on those front pages
They have a $31 billion a year advertising market
Almost all of that advertising is just people who sell on Amazon bidding against each other
To be at the top of those listings
So very hard to make money on Amazon
North of 50% of what the consumer pays for goods on Amazon from these independent sellers
It's just gobbled up by Amazon's fees
And so what they do is they raise the prices
Right?
But they don't just raise the prices on Amazon
Because Amazon has something called most favored nation status
Which you'll hear about
I think Rebecca might talk about Spotify
Yeah, you talk about Amazon
Yeah, and we'll talk about how most favored nation status shows up in all of these scams
So most favored nation status means you can't sell more cheaply anywhere than you sell on Amazon
And so that means that if you take the same goods and you want to sell them at Target
Or just at the local hardware store or the local bodega
You can't charge less than you charge on Amazon
So even if you never shop on Amazon
You pay higher prices because of how Amazon works
So let's look at how this plays out for the people who want to write books and sell them on Amazon
Amazon has a subsidiary called Audible
Audible is the world's most successful audiobook marketplace
Depending on what genre you're talking about
They control 90% or more of the marketplace
Audible has a condition that if you want to sell your books on Audible
You have to agree that they can wrap your audiobook in an encryption technology called digital rights management
And under a law from the Clinton era
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
It's illegal to remove digital rights management
Even if you have permission from the copyright holder
So if you buy my audiobook on Audible
And I say, you know what, you can remove the DRM
You can move that audiobook to a player that Audible doesn't control
I can't authorize you to do it
And if I give you a tool to do that
I commit a felony
Which is punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine
So there's a kind of stick that locks in all of those listeners for audiobooks
But there's also a carrot
And the carrot is that if you are an Audible subscriber
And you get that one credit every month
Until very recently, until labor organizing
Audible had this incredibly generous deal
Where if you were done listening to your audiobook
They would say at the end of it
Hey, just in case
If you didn't like that audiobook
You can return it for your credit back
You can get a second audiobook
With your one audiobook a month subscription
In fact, you can return it months after you've listened to it
You can return it after you've listened to it several times
And they would bombard their listeners
With these enticements to return the book
Because if you return the book
They would claw back the royalty from the author
Whose book they had sold on the platform
Now if you're an independent author
And you wanted to sell on Audible's platform
Use something called ACX
And again until a recent spate of labor organizing
If you put your book on ACX
The book that you personally financed out of your own pocket
You couldn't sell it anywhere else for seven years
So you're stuck in this platform
Where you can only sell there for seven years
And Audible gets to give back the credit to the listeners
And take it out of your pocket
Which means that the subscription is worth more
So they've wrapped the listener in bonds of iron
They've said you may not remove the DRM from the books you've bought
And go somewhere else
And in silk ribbons
We will give you back your credit
All you have to do is say
I didn't like that book as much as I thought I would
Even though I listened to it three times
And I've had it for a year
And they'll give you back that credit
So this was called Audiblegate
The authors who discovered it did some more digging
One of the authors involved is a forensic accountant
Who now writes mystery novels
Wrong person to screen
Forensic fraud thrillers
Forensic fraud thrillers
She estimates hundreds of millions of dollars in wage theft
So you can see how this lock-in
This lock-in, this choke point
Allows the firms to sometimes screw their buyers
The customers
As it is the case with all the hard goods you buy from Amazon
Whether you're buying them on Amazon or not
But also screw the producers
So these independent authors are getting the shitty end of the stick
From Audible and having their pockets picked at every turn
And that's how these monopsonistic markets work
A monopsony is like a monopoly
Except the buyer has power instead of the seller
The only place you can sell your audio books is Audible
And so Audible is the buyer for your creative labor
They have all the power
They can set the terms
And they can treat you in extraordinarily bad ways
That's a pattern that we see throughout the creative industries
So let me talk a little bit about the music markets
For recorded music
And these markets
We spend a lot of time on music markets in the book
But they are rigged in just about every way that you can imagine
And then the compounding effect on this
Particularly for independent musicians
Is really kind of extraordinary
So let me unpack at least some of them
Not all of them because then we'll be here for many hours
And I will miss my flight
So all right
So let's start with
First of all record contracts
Record contracts have been traditionally extraordinarily abusive
Because record labels were previously the only way
If you were a recording artist
Really the only way that you could get your music out to audiences
And particularly the majors
Which controlled the physical distribution into stores
That allowed them to gain a lot of control
And then they had the resources to buy up lots of other catalogues
Of recorded music
After file sharing began
And there was blood on the walls
And a lot of these companies were going under
So they came to control
These big three record labels
Came to control almost 70% of the world's global recorded music market
And they own the three music publishers
They control the song rights as distinct to the sound recordings
That control almost 60% of global song rights
And so even though then we don't need them in the same way today
For artists to get their music out to audiences
The fact that they control those copyrights
Which can last you know close to a century
Allow that has allowed them
To not only shake down artists in their contracts
But also to shape the future of recorded music markets
Which they've done with streaming
And so it might be
You've heard a lot about how streaming royalties are
You know really low
And not many artists make much money from that
But you might have less awareness
That the reason they work the way that they do
Is because the big three designed them that way
And certainly they work a lot better for the major label
The major labels than they do for any other form of label
And so there's a whole bunch of reasons for that
But we probably don't have much time for me to get into it
But one of the really critical ones
Is that the major labels
In order to let Spotify get off the ground
Right?
They were acting as if they were doing Spotify a huge favour
To let it try and create a market to replace the revenue
That was lost to peer-to-peer file sharing
When of course we know now that
And I think a lot of us knew at the time
But we know now from the empirical research
The reason why people were infringing so much
Is because they were really interested in having access
To the entirety of the history of world's music
At their fingertips
The convenience of that
And the range of it
Instead of being limited to what you could get
In a tiny record store
Was what was really the killer app for that
And so as soon as people had a reasonable
Legitimate alternative
Like they do with music streaming
They came to pay
The same we see that with music
With movies and TV shows
But the major labels said
Okay, well if you want to have a go at doing this
You're going to have to give us
A whole bunch of equity in your company
Right?
And then we will give you permission to do this
So the biggest labels
Of course
Had this huge equity stake in Spotify
Which gave it a massive conflict of interest
Because when they were negotiating for the royalty rates
They were also thinking about
Hmm, what kinds of royalties are going to maximize
The amount of money that we're going to make
Through our equity
Now the thing with that equity share
Is that when they negotiated it
They had this really neat little thing
That they had put in their contracts
And they'd had that for decades
That any money that they brought in
That was from use of music
But was not attributable to any particular song
They didn't have to share without us at all
And the equity stakes were like that
And so when they came
And that's subsequently been reformed
Again because we got a bit of transparency
There was a Sony contract with Spotify
That was leaked
And all of the musicians who had suspected
That these deals were being structured
To cut them out
Saw for sure that these deals were being structured
To cut them out
And there was a big hullabaloo
And they did through
Like a big public shaming campaign
Managed to get some reform to that
But at the time this is exactly what was going on
So what happened if we fast forward
To when we get to Spotify's IPO
It was time to renegotiate the royalty rates
That the artists were going to get
Now you might think
That's a great
That's a time when the labels have really got leverage
To do the best that they can for their artists, right?
That's not actually what happened
The major labels
Even though they had Spotify over a barrel
Because Spotify needed those catalogues
In order to be able to do its IPO
They negotiated for lower royalty rates
For their artists
Because as shareholders
They knew that was the thing
That was going to give them
The biggest bump in their shareholding, right?
And so what this means for independent artists
Is that when those independent labels
Came back to the negotiating table
Because it was their turn
To renegotiate their contracts
All those major labels
Had something called a most favoured nation clause
Which is what Corey alluded to
Which sets the ceiling
Like the most that anybody can get
And so those independent labels
Who didn't have the benefit of that
You know that potential upside from the equity
They came back to the negotiating table
To find the ceiling was actually lower than before
Not higher
And so their artists were getting less
Than what they were getting
In order to subsidise the huge windfall payday
That the majors were going to get
And so what we're seeing here
Is exactly the same playbook
Across all of the creative industries
That we look at
And Amazon actually made a picture for it
We've put it in the book
They call it this virtuous flywheel, right?
They talk about how
This is the secret to their success
That they've got all of these efficiencies
They've got these lower cost structure
Which means lower prices
That attracts more customers
That brings more traffic
And so then we've got more sellers
It's all delightful, right?
It's a beautiful cycle
And it all continues
But we hired an amazing illustrator
Called Lauren Cannard
To draw our idea of what was really going on instead
So this is not a virtuous cycle
It's an anti-competitive one
What we're seeing here
Is that these companies
Are locking in their customers, right?
So that they can then lock in their suppliers
The artists
The people who actually make the stuff
That we care about
And then once they've got their customers
And their suppliers locked in
They use the revenue that they make from that
To eliminate their competitors
So that those people have got less and less choice
About somewhere else to go
This is why so many people raise their hands
With the question
Who's a Prime member?
Because like
What are the alternatives in so many places?
How many hours would it take you
To replicate the convenience of getting that?
Because local shops
And commerce have been hollowed out
By Amazon's dominance
As a result of it
You know, using these price structures
To force out those competitors
And then once they've done that
That's when they really put the squeeze on
The final part of this flywheel
That's really going around
Is that they're forcing their workers
Their suppliers
These creative laborers
To accept an unsustainably
An unfair low share of value
So that's really what's going on
What we try and show in the first half of the book
Well, and like
To like really emphasize
The visual of the choke point
Right?
Corey and Rebecca
Frequently invoke the image of the hourglass
Right?
So imagine
That type of shape
Right?
And you've got
Sellers
Producers on one side
And then you've got
Buyers
You know, consumers
On the other side
And you've got
Like this vice grip
On the neck
Of the middle point
Right?
That's what Amazon's doing
That's what Spotify's doing
Frankly, that's what
All of these massive corporations
Are doing
Because of what
You know, y'all detail in the book
And
One thing I wanted to also
Just kind of emphasize
Picking up the role of the Amazon worker
Right?
Like
This
This impacts
All of us
Right?
Um
And again
There's one clear group
A small group
That's kind of making out like bandits here
While everyone else is pissed off
At what's going on
But no one really feels like
They have any power to do anything about it
So
Almost two years ago
For the real news
You know
I drove down to Alabama
And spoke with workers
At the Bessemer Fulfillment Center
That was attempting to unionize
With the retail, wholesale
And department store union down there
And they got two shots at an election
Because Amazon was found to have cheated
And broke the law during the first election
Because they can't
Right?
Um
And
When I say that this impacts everyone
And something that
That Corey and Rebecca write
You know
They talk about this sort of
Paradigmatic shift
That occurred in the last half century
Where
You know
The calculus by which we determine
Whether or not
There's an antitrust problem
You know
Is
Focused on
Consumer prices
If prices are low
There's essentially no problem
There's no smoke
No fire
That's what Amazon is able to do
With this system
And one of the ways it is able to do that
Is by grinding its workers into dust
Right?
And
A lot of these workers are also purportedly
The consumers
Who are going to buy the stuff on Amazon
And so when I spoke to workers down in Bessemer
A deindustrialized town
Majority black
Twice the national poverty rate
Yes
The wages at Amazon were higher
Than the average
You know
Low wage worker in Bessemer
But as the union
And the organizers pointed out
If you look at the greater Birmingham area
Amazon is paying at least $2 less
Than unionized warehouses
In that area
So
You are grinding workers down
Amazon's fulfillment centers have a turnover rate
Of 150%
Amazon itself
By its own internal studies
Has said
We're going to run out of human beings
To churn through our warehouses
By 2024 at this rate
That also has an impact
Right?
Because you can artificially keep costs low
But it comes at the expense
Of the human beings
Who are making that process happen
We all know the horror stories
And I heard them first hand
Workers
You know
Work to the bone
Walking multiple football field lengths
You know
Just to retrieve something
To fulfill an order
Their knees breaking down
So on and so forth
And so like
That is a part of this
Too
Right?
You have lower wages
You're being taken advantage of
You're being exploited
You're being run into the ground
You know
That is the cost
Of these artificially low prices
And one thing that
I wanted to ask you all about
Is
You know
This notion that creative workers are
As I said before
The sort of proverbial canaries
In the coal mine
Right?
Because you write in the book
Quote
Today's creative labor markets
Give us a glimpse
Of what a geographically
Unbound labor market
Might look like
Right?
So there's
Something very telling
In what choke point capitalism
Is doing to creative labor markets
That we should all be worried about
Because it's not just creatives
Who are experiencing this
But this feels like the trend
Towards which
You know
All other labor markets are going
I was wondering if you all
Could talk a bit more
About that
Well
Yeah
Do you want to talk about
The location independent stuff
And then
Well I guess we all found that
With COVID
Right?
That
We have been told for a long time
That for blue collar workers
Robots are going to take their jobs
Have you ever seen a robot
Try and like
Open a door
Or like
You know those hilarious videos
Where you try and get a robot
To do just a really basic task
And it's just like laughably bad at it
So
We're pretty actually surprisingly far
From that
For a lot of things
That humans can just do
Without even thinking about it
But
Do you know
What we're not far away from?
As we discovered
When COVID put us all at home
And suddenly
Within a matter of days
In some cases
Our employers discovered
That we didn't really need offices anymore
And that the job could be done
Very very well from home
Or from home
But if the job can be done
Very very well from home
It can be done
Very very well from home
Anywhere in the world
And
Do you know
What's much easier
Than getting robots
To learn how to open doors
It's just to give a couple decades
Of sort of socialization
And skills acquisition
To people in lower income countries
And then the jobs that
You know
White collar jobs
You know
Geographically unbound
From the places they're in
In many many cases
And so
So
This is really sobering
These companies
That are extracting
You know
It's an extraction mindset
Right
And we're actually starting to see
Some of the
The
The
The wealthiest people on the planet
Coming around
To the idea of a universal basic income
Because they're realizing
That they're pretty close
In many cases
To taking everything
That there is to take
And if they want to take more
They're going to have to arrange
For more to be given
To those people
So that they can extract it
Right
So it's like a strip mining kind of mindset
And so I think that that's really
That's a danger
That we've got to be thinking about
It's not that they're
That those of us
Who are still insecure
Well paying jobs
Have that because
The corporations that employ us
Do so out of the goodness of their hearts
It's because they haven't figured out
A way of taking that away from us yet
Right
But they're working on it
And creative workers are among
The more vulnerable kinds of workers
Because creators work for reasons
That aren't entirely economic
You know there's that joke about
The kid who runs away and joins the circus
And his dad finds him shoveling elephant shit
And he says son come home
And the kid says what
And quit show business
Creative work is one of those kinds of work
Where even if there's no good expectation
That you'll be able to get a fair wage from it
You just keep doing it
And there are other trades like this
What was the term that came up
In yesterday's seminar
It was something like mission valorization
Or something
Do you remember?
Yeah
Vocational awe
Vocational awe
Yes
It's a paper about this
Where you feel like
You owe something to your job
Because it's a mission
Maybe you run a community museum
Maybe you work in a library
Teachers, care workers, nurses
And so on
They're often in a position where
Even if their wages are cut
Even if they don't know that they can get paid
They still show up for work
Because the job matters
Yeah
That's a phrase that we use in the book
Is we point at all of the situations
Where people's passion is being weaponized
To facilitate their exploitation
There's a great book by David Graber, RIP
Called Bullshit Jobs
And in that book he identifies this weird premium we assign to labor that means something
Where we say to people who have a meaningful job
Why do you want to get a fair wage for it?
Isn't the satisfaction of the job enough?
Surely a fair wage should be reserved for people who have to do the soul deadening work of representing a box and a dotted line in an org chart for a princeling at a fortune 100 company and know that their work doesn't matter at all and whether they live or die will make no difference
Those people need a real reason to show up for work
But if you get the intrinsic satisfaction of helping toddlers
You should be okay with going to the food bank twice a week
So creative workers are vulnerable
Not in exactly the same way
But they are part and parcel of that kind of vulnerable workforce
But creative workers have another area in which they're vulnerable
Which is that we have a labor protection regime
That is not well suited for purpose
Which is copyright
So copyright has some efficacy
For creators and extracting revenue from the
Intermediaries, the publishers, labels, and the studios that represent them
But only when there's some bargaining leverage
Only when you can go to the label, the studio, the publisher and say
In exchange for my copyright, if you want my copyright, you and I are going to have to dicker
And I'm going to get a better deal out of you
When there's only a small number of firms
And the only way to reach your audience is to go through them
When they have the choke point
More copyright for creators is like more lunch money for bullied kids
It doesn't matter how much lunch money you give that bullied kid
The bullies are going to take the lunch money
And the fact that the bullies are out there using some of that lunch money to run a campaign
Arguing for more lunch money for the hungry kids of America
Doesn't mean that they're ever going to feed your kid
No matter how much lunch money your kid gets
And so, you know, from the two examples we gave
Spotify and Audible
The only role that copyright plays in that is to the detriment of creators
The three big labels were able to structure the future of Spotify
Because they had these extraordinary long-lived century-long copyright portfolios
The only reason that Audible listeners can't take their collections with them to somewhere else
Is because of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
Which gives more power to corporations that wrap a file with an encryption wrapper
Than it does to the workers who produce the creative work that is in that file
This isn't to say that copyright is never the answer
But if all we have in our toolbox is copyright, we will never solve this problem
And so that's why the book emphasizes all kinds of solutions that are not just about copyright law
A lot of them are about labor law, some of them are about contract law
Some of them are about technology law
And they're about how you can actually intervene in these markets
To do things that make a material difference in creators' lives
At this point, giving a creator more copyright is just giving them the right to be angry at their audience
Right? It's not going to give them more groceries
It's not going to help them pay the rent
Well, and I want us to, you know, end the panel portion
Kind of talking about some of those solutions
And again, I think it's a real testament to the work that Corey and Rebecca have done
That so much of the book does focus on potential solutions
None of them is a silver bullet
But all of them are essential tools in the toolkit
Right? Mixed metaphor, but you get what I'm saying
So, but by way of getting there
I want to kind of address something in what you both just said
Right? Because I think there is the potential for us to see this problem
And to think, oh, like maybe something happened in the digital age
That threw off the balance, right?
These corporations had access to types of technologies that allowed them to cheat
What was before an okay system, right?
A system that was working fine
But I think like, you know, this is not going to shock anyone who knows anything about me
Or I imagine any of us
But I mean like, I'm all for, you know, ripping apart the, you know, problematic
And I think unsustainable foundations of capitalism as such
Not just as an end in itself
But I think one thing that really speaks clearly in Rebecca and Corey's book
Is how there are pathologies endemic to capitalism
That make it so that capitalists literally cannot stop themselves from doing this shit
Right? They cannot stop themselves
We have enough history
We have 200 years of history showing that it is always going to trend in this direction
Towards anti-competition
Towards rent seeking
Towards monopoly
Monopsony
Market control
So on and so forth
Right?
Right?
And so I wanted to ask you both
If you could say a little more about that sort of
Yeah, like inherent pathological nature that shows that the solution to this problem is not
Fine-tuning, you know, like twisting some knobs and kind of adjusting things at the margins
But that this is a systemic problem that leads to the systemic, you know, like issues that we've been talking about
Yeah, I mean
Yeah, I mean
These richest people on the planet
You know, Peter Thiel says competition is for losers
Right?
Warren Buffett salivates over businesses that have wide sustainable modes
Like this is the orthodoxy being taught in business schools now
Right?
It's that you don't compete
It's that you find ways to prevent competition
You find ways to, you know, take that vice grip
That was a really beautiful way of putting it
You find ways of getting that vice grip in the hourglass
So that you can take away the value of other people's labor without actually having to do it
And that's why, you know, when you look around at the richest people on the planet
They didn't get that way from making things or providing services themselves
But just from finding ways of extracting the value of the people that actually did
Like that's bananas to me
It's completely backwards
And we've reached the stage now where no one's even
Rich people are not even contemplating making
Like it's just like, you know, Douglas Rushkoff has this great book
New book out as well called Survival of the Richest
Where he also talks about this
The idea of the mindset and going meta
And that this is the only way that people are thinking about making wealth
So we're so far down this track now
But if we want to think about
What does this mean for us?
What actually does trickle down?
When we have this kind of mindset in society
Because we're always told it's going to trickle down
What does trickle down?
What I think trickles down is emptiness
And disconnection
From these economic systems and these conditions
And it's actually a feature, not a bug
Right?
We're supposed to feel disconnected and empty
Because then we will fill that with ever more consumption
And ever more production
Right?
But we're more than ambulatory wallets
Right?
We're much more than that
But I'm not convinced that humans are great
At figuring out what are the conditions of a good life
And part of the reason for that, I think
Is often we're so burnt out and exhausted
From having to deal with the lives that we are living
And which again is deliberate
So that we don't have the energy to be able to challenge the status quo
And so I think, you know, what we have to do about that
Is we have to start making the first steps
Towards changing the system
As we sometimes say
You don't
The only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time
We're going to make those first steps
And then start, you know, maybe freeing up some resources
And some energy
Getting some hope and motivation to be able to do more
Because all of the people
I'm sure there's lots of people in this room
Who do activist work
And organizing work
And know how much burnout accompanies that
It's just exhausting
You know, but finding ways that we can share the load
And take those first bites
Is really kind of what we're trying to urge with this book
And join the calls for other people who are trying to create a movement
To understand that this is all part of the same fight
Yeah, I think that this idea that our markets have become very concentrated
Because of some technological factor
It doesn't bear up to scrutiny
I think the tech giants would like us to think so
I think they would like us to think that they're evil geniuses
Because if they're going to be evil, at least we can call them geniuses
And, you know, there's no point in fighting back
Because they're so much smarter than the rest of us
When you look closely at what they've done
It doesn't require genius
It just requires no regulation and unlimited access to the capital markets
You know, Google did not become this giant dominant company
By inventing the greatest products in the world
They did invent one great product
They had a really good search engine
Pretty good Hotmail clone
A browser that's okay if it isn't a little creepily surveillant
But what they do have is a lot of money
Everything that they've done that's successful that isn't those three things
Is something they bought from someone else
Their whole ad tech stack
Their whole video stack and display advertising platform
Their mobile stack
Their server management tools
Their customer management tools
Their HR tools
They bought all of that stuff from someone else
And where they tried to make their own versions of it
It crashed and burned
Because they're not an idea factory
They're a buying things company
And that was conduct that we historically prohibited firms from doing
We didn't let them buy their rivals
The great forces of history did not create a moment in which monopolies occurred
Because of things that were beyond our power
We got monopolies because we stopped enforcing monopoly laws
It's like how did the paint on your house get so faded
Well you stopped repainting your house
It wasn't because the sun changed
Right?
It was because you stopped doing the thing that you used to do
To maintain the system that you had
And when you stopped it broke down
I think we're about to see a version of this at Twitter
Right?
It's the you know
Twitter is not going to fail because the great forces of history bore down on the moment
Twitter is going to fail because they fired the engineers that kept the systems running
And so when we address ourselves to solutions in the book
We don't address ourselves to individual solutions that are about like
How do we you know drag Jeff Bezos out of his mansion to a guillotine or something
We talk about systemic solutions because if it wasn't Jeff Bezos it would be someone else
It's the system we have to fix not these individuals as colorful as they are and as rent free as they live in our heads
They're not the they're not the problem the problem is the system that lets them be there
And so for example at one point in the book we have a chapter on contracting terms
Contract is a matter of state law state law is relatively easy to change compared to federal law
All entertainment contracts are signed to a first approximation anyway in California and New York
Washington State because of you know Amazon and the games companies and and Tennessee because of Nashville
And if you have a royalty basis in your contract your contract probably gives you the right to audit the basis on which your royalty is calculated
When you go and you do those audits you'll often find that money is owed to you
We cite one company in the book that does record industry audits
They've done tens of thousands of them over decades and this is gonna shock you and surprise you
But in all but one instance where they found an error it was in the favor of the label and not the artist
We have no explanation for this some kind of horrible localized probability storm
Must be very hard to be an accountant in a world in which every time you roll the dice it just lands on its corner
Just hovering and never flips onto a face
But it is it is terrible stuff and when you find those errors
We have a source in our book who had a six-figure error in their favor
And you say to the label I'd like the money you stole from me now
They'll say you are adorable but artists can't do math
And you've just misunderstood the royalty statements
But I tell you what no hard feelings we're good-natured slobs
We will cut you a deal like 50 cents on the dollar
You don't have to sue us because you can't afford to
But if you want that settlement you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement
And your auditor has to promise that they won't audit us again
This is like the murderer being able to say the forensics crew you know
Welcome gentlemen dig anywhere in my garden you'd like for those missing bodies
But not in that back corner on the left
I'm very sentimental about it
And again contract is a matter of state law
We could amend our state contract law in four states
We could do it in any one of those states and make a difference
And we could just amend it to say as a matter of public policy
Non-disclosure cannot be enforced where it pertains to material omissions or errors
That redound to the detriment of people who are owed a royalty for creative work
And in that one short bill you put more money into the pockets of more creators
Than all the copyright term extensions of the last 40 years combined
There's a crack in the machine
And if we stick a crowbar in it we wiggle it around
Money will pour out of the machine and into the pockets of artists
And this is a thing that we're starting to see in some state laws
That the state law on e-books for libraries
That is proposed in Delaware
As I understand it has a prohibition on non-disclosure on libraries
So they can tell other library systems the deal they're getting from the publishers on this
Because when you're not allowed to talk to other people about the deal you're getting
It lets the firms play us off against each other
It lets these monopolists play us off against each other
The book is full of these systemic solutions
None of them are individual solutions
You're not going to recycle your way out of climate change
And you're not going to shop your way out of monopoly capitalism
And you know that can be dispiriting to think that there's nothing you as an individual can do
But there is one thing you can do as an individual which is to join a movement
And then as part of a movement you can demand these big systemic changes
I thought that was a great spot to end on
We can carry the conversation over to Q and A
But that was beautiful
Can we give another round of applause?
Thank you
Anyone got a question on their minds?
Yes, sir?
You spoke about laws related to e-books and states
And in Maryland we were the only state that did
Maryland, I said Delaware, I meant Maryland
Actually, could we give Michael a mic?
Because I think this would be really good to have on the recording actually
Michael is a real expert on this and has been leading the fight
I wanted to go somewhere slightly different than the laws
Just say, but what happened when we had that was that
Senator Tillis from North Carolina attacked the state
And set the copyright office against us
And we ultimately didn't prevail in that
But the law was found to be unconstitutional at the federal level
And so we're going to have to tweak it
But my question to you is, even at a state level
Although we had unanimous passing in Maryland
We know that there were states where this law came forward
Where the legislators came forward to kill it
And at a federal level we actually tried an e-book law
And in Rhode Island when the CEO of Disney calls up the legislator
And says, uh-uh
And the legislator listens
How are we going to be able to affect change
When there's powerful forces at work in legislation
To keep things exactly the way they are
And there's billions of dollars against us
Yeah, so this is what I was talking about
About how we eat the elephant, right?
It's another analogy is you're a mountain climber, right?
And you've got a whole mountain ahead of you
And that's where we are right now, you know?
I love it when Corey says, well, if you wanted to get there
You wouldn't start from here, right?
This is a really tricky spot to be starting to climb the mountain from
Because we have allowed these companies to grow so strong
And to have so many resources
And to drain the rest of us of ours
And so when you grow
When you are a mountain climber in those circumstances
You can't map out the whole path from the beginning, right?
But you can start to see the first few holds
And so really that's what we're trying to map out in this book
What are all the ways in which we can sap this excessive corporate power?
Now we've used the word monopsony before
We had it a lot more in this book on the first draft
And all of our readers begged us to take it out
Because they say it's a horrible, horrible word
We think we can make it sexy
So the thing about monopsony that's really, really important
These powerful buyers, like the way that Amazon's a powerful buyer
When it comes to publishers and authors
The way that the big three record labels are powerful buyers
When it comes to recording artists and so on
It arises at way lower market concentrations than Monopoly does, right?
So that's one thing that makes it way more dangerous
And another thing that makes it way more dangerous is
Traditional antitrust remedies, the conduct remedies
Which is where you get companies to pinky swear
They won't abuse their power
Like we did with Live Nation
As a condition of it being allowed to swallow up Ticketmaster
How well did that work out?
Really not so well
And then the structural remedies as well
And that means things like breaking companies up
These remedies don't work particularly well
It can take, how long was it with IBM?
With AT&T it took 69 years
From the first antitrust action until they were broken up in 1982
So that's not awesome
And really, really expensive as well
But do you know what?
These remedies we know are even less effective when it comes to monopsony
Than it does for Monopoly
But we do know what does work, right?
And there are three things
So directly regulating excessive buyer power
Encouraging new market entrants
And supporting the building of countervailing power
In, you know, like workers and suppliers
So in the context of libraries, for example
Initiatives like the one that we were talking about earlier
To ban NDAs so that libraries are allowed to talk to each other
About the contractual terms that they've managed to negotiate
So that they're able to get a little bit of extra power
In their negotiations with these behemoth companies, right?
That kind of intervention is the kind of thing
That we can do to start taking those first little steps up the mountain
And so I think that rather than, you know
And that's what, you know, what Max was talking about
You know, we don't have silver bullets here
Because there is no silver bullet, right?
If there was a silver bullet, we would have found it already
What we have to do is these many, many, many interventions
And keep the pressure on and keep talking to Congress people
Our representatives to be demanding that they don't just do things
Like give more support bills for more copyright
But they actually support targeted interventions
That are going to achieve the things that they say they want to achieve
That's what I would say, Corey, do you want to add anything to that?
Yeah, I mean, I think that as beloved as libraries are
And as important as creative work is
And as large as the megaphone as some creative workers have
We are not a force to be reckoned with
But if you add to us everyone else who's on the wrong side of one of those hourglass shaped markets
If you understand that we're all actually fighting different facets of the same fight
Then we become a coalition that I think will be unstoppable
I think that's what we're going to need as well
So James Boyle, who runs the Center for the Public Domain
With Jennifer Jenkins at Duke University, wonderful law professor
He tells a story about how before the term ecology was in widespread use
People didn't know they were fighting the same fight
You know, you care about owls, I care about the ozone layer
What do your nocturnal avians have to do with the gaseous composition of the atmosphere, right?
It's the term ecology that turns a thousand issues into a movement
And you know, the number of people who struggle under monopoly and monopsony
It's really just nearly everyone with the exception of a few shareholders of a few large firms
You know, if you're angry because all the beer comes from two companies
You're angry about monopoly
If you're angry because all the world shipping is done by three companies
Who for years have been telling their regulators to shut up whenever the regulators said
Hey, those economies of scale you're getting from making your ships bigger
They're gonna run into problems when one of them gets stuck into the Suez Canal
You know, you're also pissed about this kind of market concentration
If you're a glasses wearer
And you've noticed that your glasses cost a thousand percent more than they did a decade ago
It's because one company, Luxottica Essilor, owns every eyewear brand you've ever heard of
Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, Oliver Peoples, Bausch & Loam, Oakley, all one company
They also own LensCrafter, Sears Optical, Target Optical, and Sunglass Hut
They also own the largest lens lab in the world
More than half the world's lenses come from them
And iMed, which is probably your insurer
Because it's the single largest eyewear insurer in the world
And they've hiked prices a thousand percent over a decade
We're all on the same side
We're all on the same side with the people who are angry that the professional wrestlers
They grew up watching are now begging for pennies
So they can die with dignity of their workplace related injuries on GoFundMe
The reason they're doing that is because instead of 30 leagues there's one
And the rapey Trumpy billionaire who owns it reclassified them all as contractors
And took away their health insurance
We are all fighting the same fight
And once we realize that we're all fighting the same fight
Along with all the people who are angry about the concentrated power of the oil companies
And the coal companies
Then we can make real change
So what you're saying is when Swifties unite with Amazon workers
It's an unstoppable fight
Damn right
I think that's actually all we need
I would not want to get in the way of that
Yes sir
Yeah thanks
I wonder if you guys can talk about this a little bit from a cultural standpoint
I mean I sort of see these challenges as emergent properties of systems like you guys do
I also see systems as sort of emergent properties of culture
And one thing that turned my head a couple of decades ago
Was there was somebody who was working for me who was like a recovering Wall Street broker
And he helped me understand over a few months period that this ethos of raping and pillaging
Is not a bunch of people going oh I bet we can get away with this kind of nefarious thing culturally
There's actually a strong belief that it's the right thing to do
That it's the moral thing to do
That the rightness in the world happens when there's winners and losers
And the people who know how to tune these technocracies to really take advantage of people deserve what they get
And so it's a system of justification
And it's amazing to me how much Americans tolerate this really alien cultural ethos among us
You know almost like a caste system where we kind of believe that we're really owed this kind of
Yeah
Yeah so the question for the video is about this ideology of greed not just being good in a kind of Gordon Gekko sense
But greed being a mechanism where an inequality whereby we create these engines of productivity
And produce shared prosperity that it's only by being as big a bastard as you can possibly be
That we can kind of unleash the power of markets
You know you may have seen this report in ProPublica about the company that helps landlords jack up rents
And part of their argument is that if you let humans decide when to jack up the rents
Their sentimentality will get in the way of charging what the rent should really be
And when you drill into it they'll say oh well the thing is if the rents go high enough
That it will tempt in more developers to build more properties and then you'll get the rents falling
And it's only the only way that you resolve the housing crisis is by letting some people
Thousands of people be put into housing precarity or homelessness
Because that's what lures capital into the market
And you know they have a kind of side tale which is that governments can't build housing
Right and they point to the problems of public housing in the United States
And what they never mention is all the places where public housing does work
And to the extent that they that they you even talk about say Vienna or the UK
Before Thatcher sold off the council estates
Is that there's a kind of weird American exceptionalism
Where this country that is billed as the greatest country in the world suddenly becomes the worst one
Right like well Americans are just too stupid and greedy to build housing the way the Viennese did
There's something about something in the schnitzel
That makes you capable of building housing that Americans could never build
And I think that the good news is that this ideology takes work
It's not a thing that comes to us naturally
And Yochai Benkler is one of the fathers of the free software movement
He talks about how if you go to Wall Street
You go to Zuccotti Park
And you see that the kids playing in the playground surrounded by their broker parents
You'll hear those broker parents leaning over the gate of the park and saying
Timmy share
Right because nobody wants to live with a toddler who acts like we're told in business school
We all need to act it is a miserable existence
And just like in World War II after World War II
They found that a large plurality of soldiers just aimed over the enemy's head
Because no one wants to shoot a stranger
And it took work to figure out how to turn people into people who would shoot at strangers
Who they had no beef with except that their boss
Your boss had ordered you to shoot at them and their boss had ordered them to shoot at you
It takes work to convince people to be greedy to be jerks
And you know to a certain extent if we take our foot off the gas
That vehicle is going to roll to a stop
You know it takes it's going to take some work
But I think we can do it
Well like also like in terms of kind of the broad spectrum of potential solutions or partial solutions
Right I'm hoping that this week
You know is another chink in the armor
Of the capitalist ideology that leads us to believe that if someone is a billionaire
They are inherently smarter than us
And more deserving than us
And we are watching in real time
How untrue that is
Elon Musk is a dipshit
And he's like everyone is seeing in full view
And like this is not just about Musk and the tech geniuses who fancy themselves as such
But also like the old school capitalists who love you know cashing in on that same sort of adoration that we pour on the rich and powerful
One example that I would give is Warren Buffet
Right Warren Buffet you know people teach whole business classes about this guy
He's like you know business genius so on and so forth
At The Real News we spent all year reporting on how people like Warren Buffet
Have taken our supply chain and driven it into the ground by driving workers into the ground
By jacking up costs for shippers
So everyone is pissed off
Workers are quitting in record numbers after having their numbers slashed by you know
Geez 80% over the past 40 years
We are not moving nearly as much freight as we should be in this country
Like everything in the system is getting worse
And yet profits are record high
Stock buybacks are sky high
And the only genius that Warren Buffet has is that he located a fixed infrastructure
Like no one's gonna be building more freight rail lines in this country
And it's not a competitive market
It's a cartel
The main companies that own the rail the freight rail lines
They each got their lines picked out
They're not competing with anyone
So they can just again squeeze that resource
Charge more to shippers
And cut slash their workforce to pile more work onto fewer workers
Move less freight
And just you know rake in a bunch of money
All right
Sorry we had a hand up there
Yeah
Could I
No no no this isn't about me
I'm curious what you think about
And this is a little outside of the purview of the book
Which is obviously about capital
And specifically about creatives who produce goods that are sold in the private market
Which is usually like an individual to market relationship
But I'm curious what you think about academia broadly
And maybe broader than that
The nonprofit industrial complex
Because it seems to me that particularly
This has been happening for a while
But particularly post-COVID
There's been a move to try to capture the intellectual property
Of intellectuals who are within the public
Either public universities
Or private universities
That are funded by the public
Through the tax payment of their nonprofit status
So like an anecdote is a friend of mine
Who's faculty at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
As soon as the pandemic began
And there were classes were all moved to remote
She was asked to record all of her courses
Which she previously refused to do
There had been some kind of like suggestion of this in the past
But all of a sudden this became a sort of mandate
That people were being asked to sign off on
Which was to sign off on recording their lectures
And giving over the intellectual property of those lectures
To the university in perpetuity
So that they could then be used
You know
Have the class with no teacher
Imagine the savings
So I'm curious if you have any thoughts
I realize it's a little outside of what your specific area is
But it seems like the university is becoming more privatized
And trying to do a similar thing to capital
In these big capital markets
And it seems like there's a relationship there
Well again I would say it's all part of the same thing
I'm a professor at a law school in Australia
In Australia we relied very heavily on international students
To subsidize the running of the universities
When Covid hit there were no more international students
We saw the vulnerability of these economic structures
And it's been carnage
Tens of thousands of university workers laid off
And we in universities are also people
Who are really passionate about our work
Passionate about our students and our research
And always give more when we're asked for more
But what was really really clear when that happened
Was that you know a lot of these universities
That had you know even quite large endowments
Or cash reserves or real estate holdings
That they could have cashed in
In order to support their labour force
They did none of that
Right we were the first ones to go
And I think that this demonstrates exactly
The kind of the same pathology right
That it's not about the people
It's about the money
And I was thinking when you were talking before
It's something that I think about quite often
I literally do fantasize about this
What if instead of valorizing people like Warren Buffett
We valorize the people who are kind
And who dedicate their lives to their communities
And who build connection
And who make things better
Right what would that society look like
In terms of taking your foot off the gas pedal
Like if instead of valorizing
What's been kind of wild to me
So many things following Twitter in the last week
But every thread you know talking about another
Absolutely batshit thing that Elon has done
Is there will be Elon fans in there going
Oh you just don't get it
He's so smart right
It's wild to me right
So these people just really valorize that
But what if we valorize something really different
And how do we go about building the society that does that
So I think this is a very circular
And probably unsatisfactory answer to your question
But I do think that's absolutely happening
It's been happening for decades
In the academic publishing markets as well
Where these massive corporations have been extracting
Huge amounts of value
Billions of dollars
Every year from academic labor forces that are subsidized by the public
And we haven't
We've just allowed that to happen too
We have to stop allowing these things to happen
We have to demand different
We have to demand better
I want to maybe have a slight push back
I agree with your point that academic workers need to be fairly compensated
And that they should be treated with dignity and so on
But I think that we run the risk of saying
In the Spotify example say
That the problem is that all the music is available
And not that the problem is that the artists aren't being well compensated
I think pedagogically there's a good reason to record lectures right
I just think that the problem isn't students can access a lecture
If they miss a class they can go back and look at it
We can make it open access
I'm a visiting professor at the Open University in the UK
Where we sort of invented MOOCs right
Our classes are available for free
We used to broadcast them over the terrestrial airways
We still do for some of our courses
But if you want to get credentialed
You have to pay to get the examinations
And the invigilation and the evaluation and so on
Recorded lecture is incredibly helpful as well
For people who don't have the same first language that the lecturer is in
Yeah
So all of that to me is fine right
The problem isn't that like just like the problem with Spotify
Isn't that we can get all the stuff
The problem with tertiary education having recordings of professors
Is not the recording of the professor
It's the economic arrangement that accompanies it
But you know I'm all in favor particularly public universities
Making the stuff that is financed through public financing public
Right again like the problem isn't that
If you do work on a vaccine at a public university with an NIH grant
That that then doesn't become your patent that you get to exploit
The problem is that once you file that patent
The university's technology transfer office sends it to a rapacious pharmaceutical giant
That makes sure that the 2.5 billion people in the 125 poorest countries in the world
Don't get a COVID vaccine until 2025
Right like that's the that's the problem
It's not the and you know we should fund our universities well
And we should make sure that those researchers are well compensated and so on
But it shouldn't be through the creation of exclusive rights regimes
To over publicly funded work
I think that one of the tricks that large firms and corporate mindsets like to play
Is to try and trick us into thinking that we have to take the good with the bad
Or the bad with the good rather right
So Google wants you to think that it's impossible to search the internet without being spied on
In every conceivable way from asshole to appetite right
But Google like ran a non surveilling search engine for the first five years
And it was the best search engine on the internet
And it wasn't until like five years into their business that they were like
We should monetize this by spying on people
You know Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that there's no way you can talk to your friends
Without being spied on
Facebook used to bill itself as the non surveilling alternative to MySpace
And they didn't spy on you right
So these are totally separable
Like we can have universal access to all human knowledge
And well compensated academics
We don't need to choose between those two
We can do both
You know you can have universities where students get a lot of individualized attention
And where there is not just a professor but lots of people helping the professors
Without having precarious adjuncts who have to go to food banks
Right like the problem isn't that there are lots of adjuncts on the payroll
The problem is that they're paid so badly
And so I agree with you entirely
That the corporate mindset within the university
That sees the academic workers as a resource to be squeezed
Is a huge problem
But I just want to be clear that the answer isn't
To enclose knowledge that's produced at public expense
It's to fairly compensate the workers who do that work
But I do think
Yeah definitely quite poor
But I do think that the fact that in this example
That that professor sees that you know providing that access to that knowledge
Is a direct route to her potentially losing her job
Right this is like this is a huge problem right
And this is again it's the exact same pathology
Because she is almost certainly right
Well I think that I mean I agree with you that there's
That recording of lectures and having recorded lectures be available is a good
And it certainly should be the case with publicly funded universities
But I think exactly what you're saying
If what you're being asked to sign is that this is not
This is no longer your intellectual property
And it can be used for whatever including replacing you
But see I think the only reason that that's a problem
Is because you know that these universities will replace you if they possibly can
And like this is exactly the same thing that we're talking about
Well and it feels like the lunch money like example right
It's like the problem is that even in higher ed these choke points are there right
I mean right now in the largest strike in the country
Does anyone know what the largest strike in the country is right now?
UC system
UC system
48,000 academic workers are on strike across the state right now
On the other end of the country
Part-time faculty at the new school are on strike as we speak
And the thing is is that both of these groups like it's it's bonkers because at the new school
An ostensibly progressive institution that does great work has great people
87% of its teaching is done by part-time faculty by contingent faculty
That is a choke point right that is like you know that knowledge is there
That's the service that the university is ostensibly there to give
But workers are being ground to dust students are being asked to pay more for it
Someone is in the middle controlling all of that crap
So just lay out like yeah, I this is a you're getting at an important point here
Which is that when there's monopolies within the supply chain the whole supply chain starts to look like a monopoly
Because the alternative is that the monopoly crushes the other parts of its supply chain
So the university will doubtless say something like well all of academic publishing is concentrated into just a few hands
And they're screwing us all scholarly publishing is concentrated into a few hands
They're screwing us even worse
So you know our faculty need to publish in top tier journals and then those journals charge us five and six figures to subscribe to them
Our students want to get the textbooks but the textbooks cost more than they ever did
And we have to figure out how to subsidize them so we have to figure out how to concentrate
You see this in every industry so in in the US when pharmaceutical companies were allowed to concentrate
They turned around they started raising the prices they charged hospitals hospitals then started to create regional monopoly
So they could bargain back and they would say oh you want a hundred times more for your chemotherapy drug than you were charging us last year
Fine well no hospital within 300 miles of this place is gonna buy your chemotherapy drug anymore and they could get the pharma companies to budge on prices
But then they turned around they screwed the insurers
And then the insurers form monopolies and so they could push back on on pricing
So then you have this fully monopolized supply chain insurers pharmacy benefit managers pharmaceutical companies
Hospital supply companies bed hospital beds are a monopoly. They're a monopoly that's merged with the coffin monopoly which is super creepy
But saline is a monopoly
All the saline in America is made in one factory in Puerto Rico which is why after Hurricane Maria you couldn't get a bag of salt water
And and in every one of these cases they're they're merged to monopoly to fight each other
The only groups that aren't monopolized in that supply chain are the health care workers at one end who have worse wages
And worse working conditions and the patients at the other end who pay higher prices and get worse care and everyone else is you know yeah they fight with
You know yeah they fight with each other a little about who's gonna get what but the one thing they all agree on the one thing
They're all on the same side is that these guys and these guys can go fuck themselves because they're they're just there to for the taking
And this is true in in publishing you know
We just saw a wonderful thing where the DOJ or the FTC rather
Managed to convince a court not to allow
Simon & Schuster to be bought by Penguin Random House
Penguin Random House used to be two separate companies too
Now they're one
Before that it was hundreds of separate companies
Yeah you list the list out all the imprints they bought it just goes on forever
It's it's it's like farcical
But about a decade ago there was a big antitrust case because all the publishers got together to conspire with Apple
Not to allow their books to be sold on Kindles on only on iPads because Amazon was selling ebooks below cost
Because they wanted to lock in all of the readers to the Kindle platform
And when the six big publishers get together and they collude to raise prices on ebooks that is illegal
And they got slaughtered by the FTC
But if those six companies become one company and instead of the CEO of Random House the CEO of Penguin
And the CEO of Simon & Schuster meeting in a smoke-filled room to fix prices
The president of Penguin who is works for Penguin Random House Simon & Schuster
The president of Random House who works for Penguin Random House Simon & Schuster
And the president of Simon & Schuster works for President Random House Simon & Schuster get together and do the same thing
That's just business
And so yeah, we've we've now stopped those firms from further concentrating
That's good news
Simon & Schuster and Penguin Random House had this bizarre thing that they said
Which was that they would bid against each other for books if writers wrote really good books
And Stephen King went in and said that's just nonsense, right?
That's like a husband and wife bidding against each other for the same house
It's crazy, it's never gonna happen
But we've left them exposed because there is this giant monopoly in their supply chain
So we've got work to do there, right?
And it's just important to remember that like once you
Like there's never just one ant
There's never just one monopolized part of your supply chain
As soon as you got some
You get it all the way up and down the supply chain
And they crush all the businesses that don't form monopolies
And in the end you get monopolies up and down
And then the only people who are left are customers and workers
And they're the ones who really get shafted
So I know you guys got to get to the airport, right?
Yeah
So I think we have one more question
I just wanted to check if we had time
Yeah, in the back please
Thank you
I really appreciate your work and like what you brought up
But I think like what I keep coming back to is like
Yeah, what do we do and where do we have power?
Because it sounds like a lot of the solutions that you point to
Or that you've like highlighted come back to like changing laws
But the problem that you're describing is capitalism
I mean it's an exploitative system that concentrates capital
That capital is owned by a minority of the population
And like that's the thing that we have to change
And we have the advantage of being workers that actually work and produce value
And the fact that they own that value right now is something we have to change
But I think that like I'm curious where you see like examples of like workers organizing
And like really it comes down to class struggle
If we will be frank like of just like where we have where we would have power to break the monopolies
Or to break the power that they hold over us is us organizing and us looking to each other
And to us looking at you know the millions and billions of workers around the world that have immense power
But as soon as we get kind of funneled into their system of laws and their system of you know
You can't strike because your union says this and your contracts then we'll be waiting around forever
Sure
But we didn't get you know we didn't get any of the gains that we have from like
Obeying the law
Yeah
So I'm really curious if you can speak to like more examples about where workers in Spotify or Audible
Or these other places or outside of even the kind of technical like world that have organized
And where that benefits everyone
So before we answer that for the cameras the question is about what the role of labor and labor organizing is in all of this
And where that fits beside just changing laws
There's one of my favorite stories in the book is from the Writers Guild of America
And their recent strike against the big four Hollywood talent agencies
We worked with them and particularly David Goodman who was the president of the Guild over the course of that strike
And we could see like what a toll this was having on him
So basically what was happening here is that the Hollywood talent agencies had sewed up the talent
Particularly writers in exactly the same way exactly the same playbook that we've been talking about
And even though it's the so-called golden age of television
Writers share was declining, their conditions were getting worse
And they realized that they needed to take action
Now they do have a strong history of unionization in Hollywood
And that really helps because they've got that shared history
And that shared experience of knowing that solidarity does work
But still it was huge, right?
They changed, the Guild changed their code of conduct
To get rid of these conflicts of interest and shakedowns
That the big four agencies were particularly engaging in
And then all of the writers in Hollywood said
If you don't comply with the new code of conduct
You don't work with us anymore
And then in a single week
7,000 Hollywood writers fired their agents
And the agents couldn't believe it
They're just like you can't operate without us, right?
And David was actually our interlocutor
At our US launch day event in Beverly Hills
In September
And he told the story of how it took some time
And in fact he said his wife
He was a bit sheepish to say his wife noticed way before him
It took some time before the writers noticed that in fact
There could be no Hollywood without
There could be Hollywood without the agents
But there couldn't be Hollywood without the writers
And that they were the ones that had the power
And what he said was so powerful
He said, we've realized they only had the power that we gave them, right?
And this is what we all have to understand, right?
That we are the ones, the workers, right?
And the customers
We are the ones that do have the power ultimately
Collect individually, nothing at all
But collectively we've got all of it, right?
So we have to realize that
And we have to find ways of exercising that power
And doing what's necessary to achieve that
May I say something?
Sure
As a small business owner
And I know you've got to go
Yeah
So we had opened a store in Picktown in Baltimore
And we were told that we were stupid and crazy for doing that
For all kinds of different reasons, right?
And we've been there three years now
My wife owns it, we work there
We have three part-time employees
We prioritize their wages over our own
We budget about 20 hours a week for each of us at $17 an hour
While paying a minimum of $15 when you start
And our manager makes $21 and budgets more hours
So we are someplace that is attempting to do things in a subversive way
A backwards ass way
A way that might drive us out of business
I don't know
But we are doing everything we can
And we serve our community
We provide a bunch of affordable opportunities
We give books out every single day
And we buy
The bookmarks you see are sourced from a local printer
The shirts that we wear are sourced from a local printer
So we are practicing cooperative economics
And I just want to say it's just
It is that hard
It is that hard
And it's set up
That it's so difficult to do things in an ethical way
Especially when you claim to be about community
You claim to be about equity
And then when you back it up by doing it
There is a cost and there is a deep, deep risk
And it's very, very difficult
And I just thank you for this work
Thank you
It brings out you're interested
Because I'm excited to see this
It's an excellent time to point out
That we can make your books non-returnable
If you would like to get one
From Charm City Books back there
We'll deface the hell out of them
So if anyone's interested
Yeah, but this is exactly the kind of business
And the more business we have like this
Working together
And then like that's a different kind of flywheel
We can create, right?
And I'm just, you know, congratulations on doing this
And I'm really glad to hear that
We've raised the property value of our landlord
Oh, good
So that's the other thing, right?
Like you have these deadbeat landlords in Baltimore
And that's where I want to see the laws change
We talk about crime in Baltimore
But we don't talk about the economic crime
Of out-of-town development and investment
Well, and just on that note
Just to kind of close out
I think the thing to emphasize
And I'm seeing a lot of workers do this
And they're telling me this
In fact, a lot of folks that I've interviewed
Are bringing this fight to, you know, their workplaces
I'll give one example
Vincent Quiles
An incredible organizer who led the unionization effort
In Philadelphia at Home Depot
Horribly anti-union company, right?
And he realized in the process of this unionization effort
That everyone was pissed off about something
Everyone was being overworked, including the managers
And then he was like
The person who's responsible for our misery
Is not in the store
So, like, you're not the enemy
You know, if you're trying
As a small business
You're trying to practice cooperative economics, right?
You know, in a city like Baltimore
The enemies are the developers
Who are getting like, you know, millions
Tens of millions of dollars from the city
And the politicians who are just rubber stamping that
And all of that money is going out of the city
What Vince Quiles said to the union-busting consultants
Who said, we don't have enough money to pay you guys what you want
And also, we already invested a billion dollars in our workforce last year
Vince, like, responded immediately
He was like, you guys spent $15 billion on stock buybacks
So you spent 15 times more on your shareholders
Than you did on the 500,000 employees who make your business run
The enemies are actually doing us a service
Because they're making themselves a smaller target
And to Cory and Rebecca's point
We have to keep our eyes fixed on that target
And build solidarity wherever we can
And train, if we're all like Care Bears
Focusing our shit on the people at the top
On the people at the top
We can win
So let's give one more round of applause to Rebecca and Cory
And thank you again to all of you
Thank you to Nancy
Thank you to The Peel for hosting us
Please go buy this incredible book
And let's get Rebecca and Cory to the airport
If I may, I just want to thank Real News Network
Thank you, Max
I want to thank Karan, our interpreter
And if anybody wants, The Peel is open
We're usually open in the afternoons
The evenings, early evenings, Thursdays and Fridays
Three to seven
If you want to go see Lee Boot's exhibition on the second floor
Or the Sankofa Dance exhibition on the third floor
You've still got time to do that
And also, if you would like to take away books
From the MuseWeb conference
Who've kindly kind of underwritten this event
They're on the back corner there
And they are free
Thank you all for coming
Thank you all for coming
Thank you
