hello everybody welcome wonderful to be together again even if the together has
an unusual structure in that we are not physically together and obviously I must be doing something
very strange at this moment because at the very least one moment
at the very least
something unusual is going on in terms of my behavior
interestingly if we look at the idea of art
any form which is not live i.e. a symphony or dance or theater production
an oration
a performance of some kind
any of the
kinds of art
that aren't live and many of those which are
comprise something that in english we would call a recording
and i would suggest that the word recording
is related very closely to the word religion
which that ligny
the ligny phoneme or the ligny
word part
what is that called
i can't recall at the moment
indicates like ligaments
to bind
across it's very important not just to bind together
to bind together across a gap
this is the important feature of the ligny
uh... asset
in
which is
which figures in the word religion
and
is essentially translated
in the word recording
so
recording
i'm suggesting
that
the word fragment
chord
plays the same role
or a very similar one
as the lig fragment
in
religion
and
when we are recording
if i am painting
if i am drawing
if i am writing
my primary purpose
is probably quite complex
and may not
necessarily involve
the concept of
pleasing
or
impressing somehow
or
transforming
future others
others in the future
and
it would occur to nearly
none of us
yet i do think
it's entirely
reasonable
to imagine this
that we might affect
others in the past
turns out that there's a number
of possibility spaces
in which this isn't merely possible
it seems relatively obvious
to be real
in other words
to be the case
that these things happen
they occur
we can enact them
we can affect
previous others
at least
if previous others
are anything like
our imaginings
about previous others
at all
we can certainly affect them
but the weird thing
that i was doing here
is
i am pretending
that you and i
are together
in the future
so that i will be
my voice will
literally
in the terms of
um
milton erickson's
hypnotic
uh
suggestion
that is very rich
my voice
will go with you
i will go with you
into the future
so
to create this
recording
that acts
in a sense
as a kind of ligament
crossing
a temporal gap
a spatial gap
a purposive gap
right
in that
for this to happen
for me to make this
and you to hear it
we
must
form and enact
a shared purpose
and it doesn't have to be
exactly the same purpose
right
in fact
i have so many purposes
in creating these recordings
so many different
dimensions of
purposive concern
that it would be
kind of ridiculous
for me to say
oh i'm doing this
because x
right
um
because i want to
preserve my thoughts
for future generations
or
because
i want to keep my mind
and vocabulary sharp
and
embody
and improve
my skills with
oration
and perhaps rhetoric
and
you know
yes
those little pieces
are
both of those are ingredients
in the soup
but the soup is much
richer
than that
uh
huh
so
hmm
really nice
you know
what got me
making this recording
this afternoon
was
i was listening
to a
um
an interview
i think with ralph
metzger
i may be mispronouncing
his name
and uh
it was an interview
about
well you know
there's always a title
of an interview
that's supposed to say
something about
what it's about
but then there's the
actual interview
which clearly is
usually different
much like the title
of a movie
it's the way
it's the way the book
inflects the title
we read
on its cover
it's the way the movie
inflects
the uh
the few words
of a phrase
that are its
its title
that determines
whether
genius
was at play
or people
are just
putting jigsaw
puzzles together
algorithmically
and in the interview
with ralph
it was clear
that um
some of the
concerns were
the nature
of consciousness
the possibility
space of consciousness
particularly
as compared
to what we might
ordinarily
think or imagine
the transformation
of the
of the experience
of the possibility
space
under the influence
of
mushrooms
for example
hallucinogens
or perhaps
meditation
and
the possibility
that
artificial intelligence
along with
our
rather
reasonable
fears
and concerns
and so forth
uh
there's a danger
few of us
are not thinking
much about
um
he mentioned
the phrase
information
toxicity
and it's
whoever
and the person
who coined it
who
Nick Bostrock
maybe
um
but that
refers to
information
that's fundamentally
dangerous to humans
but then
he talked about
suffering
and the
imperative
to reduce
it
like
to understand
the possibility
space of
consciousness
itself
if we could
if we could
do that
um
then we could
also understand
the possibility
space
of suffering
and find
ways to
turn the
volume down
for all
beings
not just
for humans
um
and he told
an interesting
story
Metzger did
he was
the first
conference
he ever
attended
in the 80s
was in
Europe
and
um
they were
it was
sort of
a branding
discussion
that um
the US
was you know
here on the
graph
China was
here on the
graph
both of them
ahead of
Europe
and uh
the European
idea was
we'll give
you ethical
AI
right
no one
will be
spied on
we'll
determine
we're gonna
try to draft
a guideline
for the ethical
implementation
of AI
and what
Metzger
quickly discovered
was that
this was
an absolute
facade
the people
involved
were all
um
the scions
of big
industry
and trying
to figure
out how
to capture
market share
and their
actual motivations
had nothing
to do
with being
ethical
what they
had to do
with was
as usual
selling a
product
now you
can see
that
this kind
of a
situation
is an
actual
religion
it is
truly
a false
religion
it doesn't
worship a
god
it worships
it doesn't
worship
relationships
it worships
money
power
the possibility
of reproduction
and branching
mutation
it worships
corporation
right
which you
can hear
in the
core
corp
fragment
you hear
to come
together
right
esprit
de corps
corp
I think
in french
and then
you have
the o
which is
sort of
like an
o-matic
word
like
corp-o-matic
it automates
and announces
not humans
but a process
in this case
a set of
processes
that function
together
to form
something that
competes
against
gods
against
religion
against
biology
itself
against
science
against
intelligence
against
survival
right
but
it does
so under
the false
flag
of some
unique
form
of virtue
or convenience
in so
doing
it attempts
to create
cohorts
of
users
fans
customers
custom
so it
also
competes
against
traditions
and
replaces
them
with
economic
demons
essentially
economic
tumors
all of
this would
be very
surprising
if we
lived on
a world
without
it
and then
we
suddenly
saw
our
planet
right
we would
be shocked
silly
like that
that's not
supposed to be
even a possible
thing that could
happen
how could it
have actually
taken place
on this
world
and the
story of
how it
actually
took
place
is a
dumpster
fire
of
science
fiction
starters
right
little seeds
of
of
dystopian
and utopian
science
fiction
stories
it turns
out that
humans
are
we have
this
property
when we
are broken
out of
small
intimate
groups
relatively
intimate
cohorts
little
tribes
and
things
when we
are broken
out of
those
when our
direct
connection
to
living
places
the foods
of our
place
on the
world
the
climate
the
localization
when we
are
dislocated
right
on the
face of
the earth
in time
in relation
in identity
in role
when we
are dislocated
then we
become more
and more
monumentally
susceptible
to
a complex
array
of modes
of feedback
modes that
produce feedback
in the network
of human minds
and their
societies
which I would
call the
our
cognitium
our
cognitium
is very
vulnerable
and the
disease
spreads like
fire
it's contagious
as hell
there's almost
nothing to
oppose it
there are
remedies
but they
cannot
usually
compete
with the
momentum
of the
contagions
that are
now
dominant
they
actually
can
compete
in fact
a single
experiment
could take
down the
entire
system
of
malignant
pretense
that is
most of
what's going
on as
our social
and economic
systems
we could
take that
down in
probably
90 days
especially
if we
had
not just
one
really
interesting
and momentous
experiment
that could
draw wide
participation
but five
or six
that could
synergize
you could
take down
the entire
alien
cortex
in
one man's
words
right
that thing
is vulnerable
it's resting
on a very
small number
of
excessively
manipulable
pivots
and it's
catastrophically
top heavy
if you can
just touch
one of those
pivots in the
right way
the whole
thing will
fall
right over
whether or not
we'll live long
enough to
attempt such
experiments
presuming that
we don't start
one right
now
or that
even our
discussion here
is not the
beginning of
one
which it
could be
or become
human
culture
purposive
orientations
and intelligence
is absolutely
a manipulable
quantity
excuse me
quantity
or
domain
there are
thousands of
experiments
manipulating it
per minute
per second
probably
in social
media
in algorithms
in advertising
in pornography
in politics
in religion
in language
in art
I'm going to
circle all the
way back
to what got
me to hit
the record
button today
I was
listening
to Ralph
Metzger
in this
interview
and
he talked
he mentioned
Aldous Huxley
having
in his
book
the doors
of perception
which I
have
I've read
at least
once
he
mentions
that
clearly
Huxley
was approaching
the verge
of sheer
panic
and said
apparently
kind of
to himself
oh
it mustn't
become
this
this
this
is
much
too far
for this
to have
been going
this is
this has
gone too
far
if it's
going to
go this
far
this is
too far
for anything
to go
and
there is
right
this point
at the
verge
of
what I
often
describe as
non-ordinary
experience
and which
one of my
friends Jesse
yesterday was
arguing is
actually
just ordinary
experience
like there
isn't any
second thing
and this
was
she has
she has a
powerful argument
I argued
that we
maintain
both
distinctions
right
that we
see
everything
as a
unity
first
but we
also
have
the
ability
to
distinguish
but at
the
verge
of
there's
a sort
of
liminal
twilight
space
where
we
suddenly
find
ourselves
we
unexpectedly
perhaps
almost
always
find
ourselves
experiencing
a
perspective
or a
situation
that we
are
unprepared
for
that
doesn't
match up
very well
with our
common
expectations
and rational
explanations
and categories
for identity
and sequence
and meaning
and is
effectively
either
at the
edge
or
outside
the
possibility
you know
the ordinary
possibility
space of
consciousness
that we
experience
every day
and are
familiar
with
and thus
feel
comfortable
navigating
consider
that if
you're
in a
space
you're
not
familiar
with
you
actually
can't
tell
what
will
kill
you
right
so
if
it
goes
dark
it
doesn't
have
to
go
that
direction
but
if
it
goes
dark
and
you're
in
a
situation
where
there's
something
happening
that
you
don't
know
what
it
is
or
that
it
violates
the
entire
history
of
your
thought
about
everyday
reality
what we
usually
refer to
as
normative
in
one of
the
also
very
dangerous
ideas
that
there's
a
norm
because
because
really
the
the
inaction
spaces
of
biological
cognitive
and perhaps
metaphysical
relation
are so
vast
and our
expectations
and understanding
of them
are so
narrow
that
it's
like
you've
got
a
pin
cushion
300
miles
in
diameter
covered
with
pins
and
you're
going to
pull
three
of
them
up
to
pay
attention
to
this
is
what's
normally
going
on
right
normative
consciousness
we think
we know
what
everything
is
if
something
shows
up
that
draws
that
deeply
into
question
or
immediately
into
question
we're
likely
to
experience
terror
not
necessarily
this
happens
to
children
all the
time
and they
don't
flip
out
it
often
happens
to
adults
and they
don't
go
nuts
with
terror
but
you can
see
how
there
is
an
actual
problem
because
if
your
fundamental
assertions
about
the
nature
of
reality
identity
separation
what
makes
two
things
distinct
the
difference
between
cooperation
and
competition
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
predators
traps
threats
right
if
all
the
things
you
use
to
arm
your
threat
sentinel
if
the
foundations
of
those
perspectives
and
concerns
are
suddenly
invalidated
you
can't
tell
what
could
kill
you
now
you're
not
sure
what
a
threat
is
anymore
and
you
can't
tell
whether
what
you
did
in
the
past
was
any
good
right
it
could
have
been
monumentally
ignorant
because
you
were
only
seeing
three
of
the
pins
instead
of
97
of
them
transforming
in a
manifold
over
you
know
set
moment
to
moment
in
consciousness
which
is
probably
what
a
lot
of
biological
non
hyper
representational
cognitive
animals
are
doing
so
there's
this
problem
with
insight
and
the
problem
is
actual
insight
can
be
terrifying
because
it can
feel
like
you're
going
to
die
like
this
is
it
can't
go
this
far
right
this
is
way
too
far
for
it
to
go
and
clearly
in
some
cases
it's
going
to
go
much
much
further
than
that
especially
with
psychedelics
right
the
initial
onset
of
hey
this
is
a
little
too
much
turns
into
oh
my
what
is
that
you
know
like
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
my
mind
right
the
trees
are
dancing
in a
rhythm
that
looks like
letters
flowing
through
language
and
they're
saying
something
to me
in a
language
I
understand
but
isn't
English
and I
can't hold
it in
consciousness
long
enough
to
articulate
it
to
you
and
this
kind
of
crazy
you
know
like
the
world
can
turn
into
something
that
resembles
a
series
of
metaphysical
cartoons
or
you
know
figurations
of
otherwise
unimaginably
profound
meaning
and
what I
think
should be
obvious
to us
is that
the actual
possibility
space
for our
consciousness
it's like
the difference
between
the universe
and
Poughkeepsie
you know
or even
a restroom
in a
cafe
in
Poughkeepsie
right
this is
the difference
right
between
what we
are usually
doing
and
experiencing
in consciousness
with our
minds
and what
is actually
accessible
to us
and there
are forms
of cognition
accessible
to us
that literally
could outperform
the entire
history of
human science
in an hour
there are forms
available to us
that
would certainly
result in
coherent
nine-way
communication
with
anciently
evolved
non-human
intelligences
that are
native
to
time
space
right
they're
probably
in
if particles
exist
they're in
the particles
what
is going
on
right
a little
bit
of that
was just
happening
to me
I saw
something
wait a
minute
what
is
happening
there
when this
starts to
happen
not so
much in
the world
though if
it happens
in the
world
that can
be really
destabilizing
and
honestly
I remember
I've told
this story
before but
it had such
a huge
influence
on me
I was
bringing
something back
to a
friend's
house at
night
after we
hung out
and played
pool
his guitar
and
I have
permission
to enter
his house
at will
right
we're friends
it's not a
problem
but
so I
went
through his
back gate
and I
walked into
his
open garage
this little
side door
and I
was going
I was walking
toward the
door that
leads into
the living
area and
kitchen
to hang
the guitar
in its
wall hanger
and he
came out
that door
and he
certainly
wasn't
expecting
anything
to be
there
he wasn't
certainly
expecting
anything
alive
to be
there
he
definitely
wasn't
expecting
a human
to just
be standing
on the
other side
of that
door
so he
went
through
very quickly
over the
course of
like probably
something
resembling
two seconds
he went
I saw
him
and of
course I
could only
understand
this in
hindsight
but I
saw him
going
through
the
phases
right
and the
first one
was very
clearly
I'm going
to take
this out
right
it was the
masculine
house protecting
that thing's not
supposed to be
there
it's about to
die right
now
right
I mean first
there was
startlement
and then
immediately after
startlement
the kill
switch
right
that thing's
going down
but then
confusion
and then
recalibration
and probably
the fact
that I was
holding a
guitar in
my hand
just letting
the guitar
hang there
from
just below
the headstock
right
not held
like a
weapon
just hanging
in my
hand
and it's
kind of
high because
I don't want
to smack it
on anything
so I'm
holding it
up
and
yeah there
was just
this moment
where I saw
him go
through
the phase
shifts
of
what
is happening
this isn't
supposed to
be happening
this isn't
normative
and it
ended of
course with
him powering
down
the adrenaline
system
not attacking
me thankfully
because he
would have
ruined me
and
you know
recognizing
like what
what is
what has
actually
occurred
in other
words
filling in
the interval
between
the last
time he
saw me
and this
time that
he is
seeing me
with coherent
information
that structured
that interval
producing
a non
threatening
interpretation
of the
moment
now some
people
when
when
unexpectedly
faced with
staggering novelty
especially intelligent
novelty
some of those
people are going
to go nuts
because
there's all
kinds of
problems
but one
of the
problems
is
if this
is true
what I'm
seeing right
now is
real
then
everything I
ever thought
was wrong
because
there's nothing
I ever thought
that could have
allowed for
something like
this
and if
everything I
ever thought
was wrong
probably
every decision
I ever made
was wrong
and there's
an aspect of
consciousness
that sort of
watches over
the timeline
in memory
checking for
bad mistakes
stuff we
should be
ashamed of
stuff we
should be
embarrassed about
stuff we
are chagrined
about
stuff we
regret
there's an
aspect of
consciousness
that basically
probably more
than one
right
there's a
suite
of
assets
that watch
over such
matters
and if
those get
triggered
suddenly
with a
gigantic
unexpected
influx
of
stuff they
have to
process
namely
everything
we've
ever
done
very
few
people
will
manage
to negotiate
that wave
front
without
either
shutting
down
or
fleeing
or
explaining
away
what's
going
on
oh I'm
just
hallucinating
no big
deal
I guess
that's
kind of
intimate
hearing
my
hearing
me
drink
water
sound
is very
organismal
so
even
myself
okay
there's a
degree
there's
literally
a degree
and
I'm
thinking
about
something
funny
but
it's
almost
like
there's
a
membrane
boundary
beyond
which
things
should
not
proceed
just
as
Huxley
was
intimating
even
though
I
mangled
his
quote
essentially
it was
it
should
not
have
gone
this
far
and
it
must
go
no
further
right
and
obviously
what he's
talking
about
is
the
radical
and
effectively
unavoidable
right
you can't
just
turn it
down
transformation
of his
waking
consciousness
under the
influence
probably
of
Meskimo
even
myself
though
there's
a
boundary
where
if
a
relatively
ordinary
I remember
one time
I was
praying to
the sun
it was
afternoon
and
I was
very sincerely
praying
I was
almost
crying
I was
very upset
because I
felt
that the
spirit of
the sun
had
abandoned
me
so I
was calling
out to
the sun
in my
heart
and I
could see
it
I was
on my
back
porch
and
and
in a way
I'm
having
kind of
an
experience
at the
moment
so I was
praying to
the sun
and
suddenly
it was
as if
I was
having
a vision
in the
special place
in my
mind
where
insight
and
visionary
experience
happen
or
and I
think of it
as a place
even though
clearly it's not
a place
but I could
locate it
where I think
it is
physically
I just
don't think
it's
physical
right
these are
all
what
are they
what is
the word
these are
the word
will come
to me
these are
common
prosaic
right
those are
the prosaic
ideas
that I
that I do
have
okay
I just
don't trust
them
so I
had this
vision
the sun
seemed to
be showing
me
what it's
up to
like
one of
the
things
it does
that's very
important
around here
that the
humans don't
know about
that was a
strange
emphasis
and
the sun
seemed to
be showing
me
that it
was manipulating
a complex
manifold in
a crucial
way
that
structured
and supported
the
oh I
get it
it's
Sunday
that's the
motorcyclist
procession
that you hear
in the
background
I guess
I'm going to
let it go
on and
not meet
the mic
so bear
with me
the sun
showed me
this
impossible
a thing
you could
never imagine
if you spent
your life
trying
and it
showed me
features of
it
why they
were important
and what
their results
were
in
the solar
system
and on
our world
and
to say
my mind
was blown
would be
a wild
understatement
this was
like nothing
I imagined
to be
possible
although
one thinks
that if a man
begins to pray
to the sun
then
surely
he will not be
too surprised
if the sun
actually answers
but since
that is
almost never
part of my
normative
experience
and my
regular
everyday
consciousness
certainly
doesn't
think
doesn't believe
in that
the aspect
of my mind
that believes
in that
is very
different
from my
waking
rational
mind
and those
the rational
mind is
extremely
threatened
by the
existence
of such
an other
mind
mine is
and someone
you know
a therapist
listening to
me or
you know
a psychologist
might be
thinking
hilarious
thoughts
here like
oh good
luck in
this guy
maintaining
anything
resembling
coherent
a coherent
psyche
he's just
going to
continue to
undergo
various
forms of
schizo
you know
schizogenesis
but it's
not entirely
true
there is
sort of
a truce
between
the two
kinds
of mind
or the
two aspects
and maybe
each aspect
has many
sub-aspects
but what
happened
immediately
was
my rational
mind said
no
absolutely
not
no no
no no
no
no
we're not
no we're
not doing
that
uh-uh
I'm not
we are not
going there
like
what was
Churchill's
quote
it was
something
like
perhaps you
know what
it is
up with
this we
will not
put
right
yeah
that's
my waking
mind
fiercely
if I'd
been riding
a horse
it would
have dug
its front
we'd have
been at a
gallop
we'd have
been flying
along
it would
dig its
front
paws
into the
earth
lower its
head
buck its
ass
and catapult
me into
free space
no I'm
not going
there
like put
totally put
the brakes
on
and
it might
be
useful
we might
need both
kinds of
cognition
but they
can certainly
play together
better
more cooperatively
and what
ended up
happening
was
when I
handed
okay
when I
handed the
vision off
to the
linguistic
aspect of
my
rational mind
and said
here
what I
need from
you
is to
help me
understand
how I
could
explain
this
or talk
about
this
to
other
humans
using
language
once it
realized
there was
a role
for
its
kind
of
skill
and
its
some
of its
finest
articulations
once it
understood
like
oh
I'm not
being
excluded
I have
a very
important
role
here
this
isn't
going to
just
take
over
consciousness
so that
I get
evicted
then
that
aspect
calmed
down
and was
perfectly
happy
with its
new job
which was
to find
some way
to talk
about
the
vision
and that's
something it
was used to
because it
had practiced
it long
for a long
time during
a nine month
phase of my
life
that wasn't
my first
embryogenesis
though maybe it
was doing it
then too
I don't know
but yeah
it responds
with terror
sometimes
but not
always
there are
people who
under the
influence of
sudden
inexplicable
catastrophic
novelty
such as
arises
during
lucid
dreaming
or perhaps
the use
of some
psychedelics
the hopefully
intelligent
use
of some
psychedelics
the occasionally
intelligent
use
wow
so
there are
some people
who naturally
submit
right
they just
immediately
surrender
to the
situation
and that's
almost the
explicit
opposite
of forming
up against
it
there's a
fallen tree
it is
evening
the reflection
of the branches
of the tree
forms a second
tree in the
reflection on the
water seemingly
on the water's
surface
but it has
depth
it is dim
but not dark
and the waves
are making
the lower tree
the reflection
tree's branches
wave and pulse
and that is
an effect
that must
for tens
of thousands
of years
have been
familiar
to our
ancestors
as a
portal
portal to
what
well
a portal
beyond your
regular waking
world consciousness
and into a
variety of
things
including
other states
not states
other modes
yeah
and multi-modes
of consciousness
awareness
purposeful
potential
the possibility
space of human
consciousness
so some
people naturally
relax into
the sudden
onset of
extreme novelty
obviously
it seems
very likely
that
death
whatever
experience we
may have
or not have
at death
and let's
be clear
this must
probably
resemble
the broad
the very
broad array
of experiences
that
we have
falling asleep
whole library
of different
kinds of
experiences
we may call
them all
dreams
they're not
that's like
saying
it's like
saying the
word
things
to refer
to objects
that can
be discerned
by the
mind
right
the fact
that you
have one
oh there
it is
there it
is
there's
what I
was looking
for
oh and
it's not
what I
thought it
was
okay
huh
so I
thought I
saw a
kingfisher
the other
day
it looked
a lot
like one
but it's
actually a
wood duck
now you
can look at
what just
happened there
okay
experienced
phenomena
other day
saw a bird
blurry
moving fast
I thought
it looks like
a kingfisher
and kingfishers
are rare
so I was
hoping to
see a
kingfisher
first of all
the word
kingfisher
telling nothing
about the
bird at
all except
maybe it
eats fish
okay
doesn't help
me understand
any of the
features of
the bird
and a language
like this
makes us
dumber
every time
we use it
because the
language
should have
some links
at least
connotations
that give us
information
about who
the bird
relates with
what it
does
it sounds
it's mating
month
which moons
it's active
in which
ways in
all these
things
but something
that just
says you
know
blop
that's a
blop
that's going
to make us
dumber
every time
and admittedly
the word
kingfisher
has some
connotations
very important
royalty
kingship
powerful
divinely
mandated
or
you know
blessed
right
and then
fisher
which
has lots
of connotations
besides
just catches
fish
fisher king
in christian
ask
literature
and so
forth
so it
has a few
wood duck
has almost
none
some of
the words
in english
still have
something
left in
them
it's not
just
blop
but
it's not
much
compared to
older languages
i mean
older languages
had the
opposite
problem
swarming
connotation
webs would
come to
mind
in a language
where
each letter
has a
spelling
each letter
has six
different
numbers
associated
with it
under
different
conditions
you know
and so
forth
but yes
the sudden
onset of
novelty
often
casts us
into
a crisis
that
that
crisis
tends
to
resolve
in
one
of
three
ways
what
would
these
three
ways
be
let's
see
well
imagine
what
they
might
be
i'll
give
you
a few
moments
try
to
imagine
what
usually
happens
to
human
minds
when
they're
suddenly
faced
with
monumental
novelty
see if
you can
come up
with
three
distinct
responses
there's
probably
seven
or
fifteen
or
a
thousand
or
something
but
let's
go for
three
so
one
is
relatively
well
known
to
older
audiences
thirties
forties
fifties
very
common
for
young
women
when
they
actually
see
the
human
males
that
comprised
the
rock
band
the
Beatles
they
would
apparently
undergo
such
a
radical
and
sudden
cascade
of
internal
stimulation
and
thus
feedback
in their
nervous
systems
that
they
would
lose
consciousness
right
and
just
fall
over
unconscious
fall
down
to the
ground
and
sometimes
on
moss
wow
a
male
is
approaching
a
giant
male
heron
is
approaching
his
nest
I
wonder
if
he'll
I
wonder
if
he'll
dance
I
wonder
if
he'll
signal
to
other
herons
that
can
see
him
huh
now
he seems
to be
relaxing
wait
uh
oh
there's
a little
bit
of
dance
there
extending
the
neck
high
with
the
neck
feathers
spiked
out
and
then
a shake
and
then
a call
and
then
relaxing
i'll
tell you
a secret
about the
geese
that
even
the
ornithologists
don't
know
and
they
wouldn't
believe
it
you
can
tell
which
one
of
those
is
male
and
female
visually
the
same
way
the
geese
do
but
there's
nothing
in
the
literature
about
this
you
see
the
way
that
the
white
sticks
up
on
the
butt
of
the
front
one
that's
the
male
and
you
see
how
the
other
one
is
relatively
level
yeah
that's
the
female
and
nothing
my
pleasure
i got
a bit
distracted
by
the
lake
and
the
heron
i
once
saw
his
dance
and
i
knew
uh
in
the
non
rational
aspect
of my
mind
i
knew
ah
this
in a
sense
is
um
this is
a
magical
thing
this
is
not
necessarily
supernatural
but
qualifies
for the
connotation
web
of that
word
it
is
powerful
and
not
in the
way
that
rational
things
or
mechanics
are
powerful
and
i
learned
a
little
bit
of
how
to
emulate
parts
of
that
dance
by
watching
that
one
time
the
only
time
i've
seen
it
so
okay
sudden
onset
of
novelty
what
happens
unconsciousness
fear
right
which
let's face
it
very
metabolically
expensive
not
likely
to
resolve
the
situation
because
it
will
produce
feedback
around
the
features
that
are
most
troubling
in
awareness
right
it'll
produce
a
feedback
effect
in
awareness
where
i
begin
by
reacting
to
phenomena
to
a
phenomena
but
quick
very
shortly
thereafter
i'm
actually
reacting
to my
own
reactions
to
phenomena
right
and now
i'm
in bad
trouble
because
now
it
almost
doesn't
even
matter
if
the
phenomena
goes
away
i'll
keep
reacting
to the
reaction
to the
reaction
to the
reaction
for
some
time
right
for
some
interval
of
time
so
terror
slash
anger
right
like
fright
flight
fawn
freeze
now
it turns
out that
the
fawn
response
tends
to
lead
to
uh
uh
fawning
tends
to
lead
to
surrender
um
fright
flight
freeze
tends
to
further
self
self
stimulation
one
might
imagine
that
the
uh
unconsciousness
of the
girls
who saw
the
beetles
guys
and i
mean women
have fainted
for all
kinds of
reasons
my mother
once
fainted
um
in a grocery
store
in the
afternoon
probably a
blood pressure
problem
um
at least
you know
this is what
my mechanical
thought
imagines
uh
so then
of course
the
the third
option
is
fascination
um
what
uh
co
co-emergence
with
the experience
right
the self
becomes
actively
emergent
it co-emerges
with the
experience
it
it
neither
forcefully
differentiates
nor
merges
um
there is
an
elision
eliding
sort of
quality
uh
as if
the
experience
and
what is
emerging
uh
co-conduct
each other
right
uh
in the
sense of
how a
conductor
how a
symphony
may
sometimes
relate
with a
conductor
when they
are both
skillful
and they
are really
doing what
they appear
to be
doing
honestly
i'm sure
conductors are
going to be
really mad at
me for
saying this
but i had
a close
friend who
was a
conductor
when i
was in
my early
twenties
his name
was granville
and
and
i always
thought
it never
it was
never
obvious to
me that
conductors
were doing
anything that
was actually
necessary
to cause
an orchestra
to become
coherent
a quartet
can do
it
the
conductor
seems
a
typically
the idea
of the
conductor
seems a
typically
western
um
monarchic
you know
hang on
monarchic
hierarchic
um
masculocentric
i mean i
could go
on
it just
it just
seems
egregiously
unnecessary
now
conducting
is one
of the
aspects
of
the
creation
of music
that i
have not
studied
um
so i
don't know
what is
actually
going on
there
i do
know
that it's
relatively
difficult
to learn
and requires
something
resembling
the skill
of the
pianist
where
you have
to
you must
do two
different
things
with each
of your
hands
and arms
you have
to be
able to
have one
rhythm
with your
left hand
and a
distinct
rhythm
with your
right
though
it is not
always the
case
during
the inaction
of conducting
behavior
that this
is happening
it just
has to be
able to
you have to
be able to
do it
because it
will be
required
this is
one thing
and i'm
still not
sure that
conducting
is necessary
for symphonies
i very much
suspect
that the
symphony
could have
a team
of leads
the leads
could work
together
to signal
somehow
if signaling
is even
required
oh wow
there's
another
blue
heron
doing
its
circ
aviation
of the
nest
they're
so
huge
their
wingspan
well
i guess
that's only
true compared
to most
of the
birds
we see
see
that's
the weird
thing
about
comparative
consciousness
right
it compares
but it
uses
standards
as its
comparators
now if
we were to
suddenly
intentionally
change those
standards
oh shit
here come the
motorcycles
again
dang
if we were to
suddenly change
those standards
all of our
derivations
would be
different
right
if the
standard for
gigantic
is 19
feet of
physical
wingspan
then most
of the birds
are microscopic
and the
herons
are you
know
modestly
unsmall
or something
right
so yeah
the comparators
we select
this is why
humans
often
especially
in language
they will
say
well you know
most people
xyz
things
they think
are true
of most
people
but they
have never
examined
most people
what they
are actually
talking about
is how
they think
about most
people
and how
most people
are inclined
to think
about most
people
and what
they've heard
most people
saying about
most people
and so forth
the worst
common
denominator
problem
you know
the actual
novelty
of what
is happening
in my own
body
over one
second of
time
is probably
staggering
enough
that if
a hundred
thousandth
or a
millionth
of it
were suddenly
available to
my conscious
awareness
I would
fall unconscious
it would
overwhelm
it would
blow the
breakers
it would
blow the
breakers
or
if I
could learn
to maintain
consciousness
under the
influence
of like
a millionth
of that
actual
physical
manifold
of novelties
and impossibly
ancient
relationships
then I'd
probably
become
capable
of
Siddhis
right
superhuman
categorically
superhuman
behaviors
senses
abilities
so forth
and this
is part
of what
I argue
that we
should
and must
explore
together
we must
retrieve
together
the possibilities
of our
humanity
that have
long been
occluded
by language
culture
thrisps
corporations
war machines
propaganda
quote
civilization
unquote
but even
I when
faced with
novelty
happened to
me a couple
times recently
where I
found myself
in the
in the
presence of
a physical
phenomena
a small
one
that
I could
not
immediately
categorize
or I
couldn't
immediately
completely
categorize
so
in both
of these
cases
so I
could tell
in both
cases
that what
I was
probably
looking at
was an
insect
in the
first
case
the
behavior
of the
insect
was so
novel
that
I had
I had
the beginning
of that
feeling
Huxley
described
I am
fascinated
by insects
I've spent
good chunks
of my life
in
amateur
study of
them
I adore
them
I pay
attention
to them
I notice
them
so
the first
situation
was an
insect
behaving
in such
a way
that I
could not
understand
A
what kind
of an
insect
it might
possibly
be
and B
what the
hell
it was
doing
and C
it also
had the
aura
that the
dancing
male crane
had
ah
this is
magic
this is
powerful
this is
supernatural
this is
not ordinary
who is
it
in
his
little
book
on
language
I think
might be
called
language
and myth
Ernst
Cassery
talks about
the creation
in an
African
culture
of what
he refers
to as
a
tro
T-R-O
and
I'm not
sure where
he's getting
his data
from here
it sounded
like he
actually
went in
person
to talk
with the
people
of the
tribe
he was
speaking
of
but
essentially
it's
something
he would
call
a
momentary
god
and
this
is
anything
that
left
a
profound
impression
on
someone
probably
almost
always
in that
culture
a
male
but
like
let's
say
you're
you're
extremely
thirsty
you're
dying
of
dehydration
and
an
animal
leads
you
to
a
place
to
dig
and
you
find
water
there
it
is
a
tro
or
you
something
there's
a series
of shocking
events
that take
place
and it
seems
to you
that it
is
because
of
this
tree
right
here
that
these
things
take
place
this
is
what
I
felt
I
felt
terror
for
a
moment
a
very
brief
moment
when
I
saw
the
insect
doing
what
I
had
never
seen
an
insect
do
yeah
that
was
I
my
rational
mind
went
into
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
what
is
that
that
can't
be
true
that
can't
be
right
I've
never
seen
that
this
is
going
this
is
taking
things
too
far
this
is
too
far
to
take
things
for
a
moment
now
what
it
was
doing
was
hovering
half
hovering
in a
sort
of
what
is
the
word
half
hovering
in the
pattern
of a
lemniscate
a lemniscate
pattern
a figure
eight
except
with
teardrop
sides
rather than
circles
yeah
it was
hovering
slightly
hovering and
moving over
the carpet
in the
hallway
under a
lamp
in this
pattern
and
over time
it calmed
down
I got
a jar
I put
the jar
over it
I put
paper
under the
jar
and when
it
completely
calmed
down
it was
clear
that it
was
some
form
of a
cricket
and
I believe
that I
rationally
now know
what was
happening
which was
that
the
presence
of the
light
and
in the
night
time
triggered
it
in a
way
similar
to how
the
full
moon
might
otherwise
trigger
it
to
spread
pheromones
and
attract
mating
companions
now do
I think
that quote
is what
was happening
on quote
no
in
representational
cognition
in the
aspect of
mind
that thinks
about
cause and
effect and
mechanics and
so forth
yes
in that
layer
not a
bad
probable
description
of what
was
happening
even though
I don't
actually know
what the
creature was
doing
and at
first I
couldn't tell
that it
wasn't
injured
right
it wasn't
clear that
it wasn't
a flying
creature that
was failing
to fly
so as I
continued to
observe it
I went
through the
phases
similar to
what my
friend went
through
I was
extremely
puzzled
but the
fear wore
off pretty
quick because
the scope
was narrow
enough
that it
probably wasn't
going to
threaten
everything I'd
ever known
and it
wasn't going
to invalidate
all the
decisions
and
categorical
derivations
I'd ever
made
it had a
limited scope
I realized
fairly quickly
I could
categorize it
it wasn't
an insect
but at
first
I did
feel fear
because I
couldn't
figure out
what my
own role
was when
I encounter
something that
I don't
know what
it is
this calls
my own
identity
into question
because we
enact
identity
together
we become
who we
can become
together
whether we
think so
or not
most of the
time
and so
experience
draws
like there's
a
negotiated
a
rhythmically
negotiated
arisal of
identity
in circumstance
right
Joe thinks
he's Joe
he just got
home from work
he takes a
shower
makes some
tea
reads a book
he's listening
to Bach
he's very calm
he knows who
he is
suddenly
guys in
battle armor
with AK-47s
bust through
his roof
come down
on strings
and point
guns at him
is Joe
the same
Joe that he
was a
moment ago
absolutely
not
right
like
context
calls us
into
role
behavior
and our
if you
if we change
the perspective
of context
if we
if we change
our orientations
within context
which we
certainly have
volitional
the volitional
ability to do
then we become
different kinds
of beings
and different
different versions
or modes
of our
possible selves
so part
of the
problem
the fear
of sudden
the onset
of extreme
unexpected
novelty
is that
it not only
causes us
to question
if it's
broad enough
right
all historical
derivations
and activity
it shatters
our own
sense
of coherent
identity
for ourselves
and maybe
this is part
of what is
meant by
when I say
the phrase
it is
powerful
right
which I mean
in a ceremonial
sense
not in a
representational
sense
I don't mean
it's like
PG&E
and yet
that connotation
isn't bad
because the
association
with electricity
thunder
lightning
is very
strong
right
it is
powerful
so yeah
what happens
when we
suddenly
encounter
unexpected
novelty
now obviously
one of the
things that
will almost
always happen
in a
this often
happens anyway
in lucid dreaming
experiences
is that
as the
mode of
awareness
begins to
shift toward
lucidity
there's a
pretty good
chance right
at that
boundary
that the
manifold
will collapse
and we
will wake
up
but we
can learn
by practicing
presuming that
we can
practice our
way to
awareness in
the dream
state
which certainly
if anything
is a spiritual
practice
this thing
is
or is one
of them
if we
can practice
our way
to
awareness
in the
dream
state
we can
learn
how to
sort of
turn down
the volume
on
how to
kind of
slide into
the manifold
sideways
rather than
directly
penetrating it
from above
and by the
way
similar
things are
the difference
between a
planet that
gets snuffed
by an
asteroid
and one
that doesn't
like angle
of approach
turns out
to matter
a lot
in all
kinds of
human
and biological
situations
but yes
so
if we
learn
how to
we can
learn
how to
sustain
awareness
in such
a way
that
it doesn't
cause the
bubble to
pop so
to speak
then
lucidity
will arise
and in
that
situation
what we
will almost
certainly
experience
is
an
upsurge
in novelty
a
transformation
of color
senses
relational
feelings
depth
in the
dreaming
experience
for some
people
it becomes
ultra
vivid
for others
there are
oral
transformations
right
there are
sounds
in one
dream I
had recently
where I was
on the
verge of
it
I could
taste
flavors
which is
pretty uncommon
for me in
dreaming
experience
but yeah
that's a place
where we can
experiment
with relating
with novelty
in consciousness
right
dreaming is
really profound
in that
it's basically
I wouldn't
say
that what we
can learn
and explore
in dreaming
is without
consequence
because it's
not
but it's
very different
from a
situation in
which there are
physical
relational
and economic
consequences
perhaps
spiritual
consequences
metaphysical
consequences
in some
cases
depending on
what we
mean by
the word
the way
that the
waking world
seems to
be
now you
can play
the waking
world
as if
the consequences
are not
trenchant
and
there are
some forms
of play
in which you
can do
this with
relative
safety
a degree
of safety
but ordinary
physical
existence
is fairly
fraught with
danger
what we
call danger
someone who
has
transcended
the
foundations
of fear
is likely
to
appear
you know
extremely
courageous
but it's
not really
that they
it's not so
much that they
possess the
quality of
courage
as it is
they no
longer
enact
the impediments
that comprise
fear
and that's a
really important
thing like in
one of my
recent videos
on temperance
I talk about
the difference
between stuff
we have to
do to be
good
and stuff
we have to
not do
to have
the opportunity
to become
good
because
you kind
of have to
not poison
the water
first
before you
make the
soup
and if you
poison the
water
first
now you
have to
introduce
complex
antidotes
before you
can make
the water
you know
before you
can drink
the water
or others
can drink
the water
so to speak
metaphorically
and I
think
there is
such a thing
as courage
there are
behaviors
that are
bold
and courageous
they have
the positive
quality
of being
courageous
and yet
at the same
time
there is
something like
fearlessness
which is
sort of
that
the possibility
of fear
is so
limited
that it
cannot
form up
it cannot
restructure
consciousness
oh my god
the owl
must be
huge
wow there is
that thing
again right
I'm like
wow
bigness
big birdness
the other
day
this is
really ironic
so
on the
very day
that
I think
I was
making a
recording
it was
about this
time of
the evening
getting dark
and
someone
was
driving
at
relatively
high speed
backwards
up one
of the
roads
in the
park
here
and at
first
part of
me
took
offense
and was
like
what the
fuck
is that
guy
like
what
the
fuck
is that
guy
thinking
or that
driver
wasn't sure
of their
gender
presumed
they were
male
and then
immediately
I realized
I'm
probably
more
disoriented
than that
guy is
because
instead of
paying attention
to what
I'm doing
or acting
in a
purposeful
intelligent
fashion
I've
decided
that I'm
like the
local
normal
behavior
cop
and I
need to
call this
guy out
and sort
of write
him a
ticket
in
consciousness
which
means I
am
completely
defecting
from my
own
way of
life
and being
in the
moment
in effect
I have
become
an idiot
by thinking
that somebody
else is
an idiot
or acting
crazy
an idiot
in the
old
Greek
sense
of
in a
private
universe
not
connected
with the
beings
around
us
so I
had this
thought
and I
found it
hilarious
to imagine
that at
first
that my
sort of
self-righteous
indignation
what's this
guy doing
once again
right you
can see
onset of
unexpected
novelty
novelty
is in
this case
of the
category
behavior
of an
unconnected
human
right
seemingly
unconnected
to me
unknown
random
human
my
response
is policing
what the
fuck
is that
guy
doing
you know
like that's
just
this person
has clearly
gone out
of their
mind
up with
this I
will not
put
we should
not put
you know
right
this has
gone too
far
that's
that's
going too
far
and you
can hear
this
weirdly
entitled
like
arbiter
of what
is reasonable
and not
reasonable
arbiter
of up
with what
we shall
put or
not
right
taking over
my mind
and so I
collapse in a
sense the
manifold of
my possibilities
collapses into
this one
thing and
ironically
the same
night
my son
called me
and he
was talking
about the
same problem
and we
had a long
hilarious
conversation
because we
had both
noticed
in our
own
and in
both of us
it had to
do with
observing another
driver
particularly
someone who's
driving
and we
had both
noticed our
predilection
to
it's okay
we had
noticed our
predilection to
convert to
judges and
then think
that there's
this weird
sort of
self-importance
that goes
along with
the conversion
process in
most of us
much of the
time
where
we feel
that we
are being
somehow
righteous
or in
the know
or correct
or virtuous
you know
we are
enacting the
protect the
group instinct
protect
others
instinct
and so
perhaps even
we think
we're being
here like
we may
have
delusions
of heroism
and stuff
like this
right
and so
it was so
funny to
have this
discussion
with my
son on
the very
same day
when the
same insight
had occurred
to me
post reaction
to sudden
human
behavioral
novelty
you know
scope is
relatively
limited
again
it's not
going to
change
everything
I ever
thought
or did
but
what happens
when
the structure
of consciousness
itself
radically
transforms
during
experiences
of hypnopompia
hypnagogia
hypnosis
trance
non-ordinary
intrusion
into
you know
the sudden
emergence
of non-ordinary
or super
ordinary
phenomena
stimuli
etc.
into regular
everyday
waking
consciousness
that stuff
is unprepared
for that
unless it
has a lot
of practice
hello
you know
I am
told
by my
friend
Ryan
First
Diver
that often
in the
sweats
and I'm
not necessarily
claiming that
this is
purely
metaphysical
I'll explain
what I mean
but often
in the
sweat
lodges
the men
are literally
terrified
like some
of them
are crying
if I remember
what he said
correctly
they often
they're like
losing it
they
they really
believe
they are
about to
die
and
sometimes
some of
them
and this
is not
nothing to be
ashamed of
it's not
something that
is frowned on
I don't think
though some
inactions of
it might be
it's not
that they
it's not
necessarily
probably that
they think
they're going
to die
it's that
they can't
tell they'll
survive
in a way
I mean
maybe those
are two
faces of
the same
thing
but my
point is
that
when we're
unfamiliar
with the
boundary
between
the relatively
normative
world
in which
our
representational
thought
evaluation
and behavior
functions well
enough to keep
us alive
and confident
of our own
lucidity
sobriety
then we're
okay
but when
we get to
the boundary
and we're not
used to being
in the boundary
especially if
we're going
with others
that stuff
gets pretty
rocky
and if
if we are
thrust across
that boundary
right
this is part
of the problem
with doing
psychedelic drugs
is that
you're not
being guided
to the boundary
and familiarized
with it
and then
gently led
across it
instead
you're being
it's like
flipping a
switch
right
third toke
of DMT
the universe
disappears
and is
replaced
by something
absolutely
unlike
your common
experience
with some
degree of
resemblance
perhaps
to extreme
lucid dreaming
experiences
or hypnagogic
or pompic
experiences
things get
tricky
near the
boundary
but it's
not necessarily
it's not
usually a good
idea to just
push people
across it
now on the
other hand
drugs are a
little weirder
than we
imagine
I don't
know
if there's
anyone
who
drank
ayahuasca
and nothing
happened
meanwhile
all the other
people who
drank the
ayahuasca
have
you know
experiences
of it
but I
I remember
when I was
young
the first
few times
I smoked
weed
and I was
fully capable
of smoking
weed
because I
smoked
cigarettes
so I knew
what it meant
to inhale
smoke
and I knew
what it meant
to inhale
the smoke
and hold
it
and so forth
no
no response
to my first
experiences
probably the
first six
nothing
no effect
I could
discern
seventh
experience
just could
not stop
laughing
total
collapse of
consciousness
into
extreme
hilarity
in danger
of
you know
urinating
on myself
I was laughing
so hard
don't think
I actually
did
uh oh
the natives
are restless
because of
a sports game
the monkeys
are making
dangerous noises
and doing
gorilla things
and making
fists and
shaking them
in the air
and stuff
wow
that's quite
a scene
by the way
that's
that's a lot
of novelty
um
I think
it used to
take some
courage for me
to
enter a place
where people
were doing
something like
that
because as a
as a sensitive
person
that amount
of noise
and yelling
and stuff
is uh
intense
right
keep it in there
for a minute
come on
Joe
I'm just
watching the
pizza channel
I'm just
watching the
pizza channel
yeah I'll come
back later and get
a pizza
ah okay
thank you
yeah it was my
loss
it was my
loss
it was one of
my favorite
foods
no that's not
what happened
I called
I called
I tried to
order one
they're like
you know
18 bucks
I'm like
18 bucks
there's a guy
and I'm like
personal
personal pizza
he's like
yeah we
we increased
the price
yeah that's
true
that's
that's my
bad
yeah yeah
that's my
my bad
but you know
last time
when I saw
you at least
I woke up
grazie
yeah yeah
what is your
name
Joe
I am Darren
no no no
now you're
acting like
we're in
New York
yeah
yeah of course
of course
it's okay
yeah everybody
makes mistakes
we're human
I'm glad to
see you too
I'll be back
later and get
a pizza
all right
right on
you too
thank you
one day
I called
the pizza
place
they serve
these
little personal
pizzas that are
delicious right
they're like
seven bucks
so it's
cheap
and it's
good
and
so one
day I
called
and I
tried to
order one
many many
years ago
probably four
years ago
and I
talked to a
guy on the
other end
picked up the
phone and I
said I'd like
to get a
personal pizza
blah blah
what I want
on it
and he
tells me
17 bucks
and I
said for a
personal
he goes
yeah price
went up
okay
so I never
went back
and I never
checked to
see if it
was wrong
I just
believed
that the
price had
doubled
because lots
of other
prices doubled
right
or tripled
and so
for years
I didn't
go in
and then
the other
day I was
talking with
the same
guy Joe
the owner
of Pasquale's
Pizza on
8th and
Irving in
San Francisco
give him a
little plug
there
pizza's good
yeah I was
talking with
him outside
he said I
haven't seen
you
I said yeah
yeah
so I
didn't tell
him why
at that
time
but I
went in
later
and just
asked you
know how
much for a
personal pizza
like 7 bucks
and I was
like what
I thought
you know
and somehow
that topic
is appropriate
he put cheese
in my hand
it was
ridiculous
now my
hand is all
greasy
and I have
to find a
way
to wipe
it
without
spreading
the
grease
thankfully
I have
some
napkins
and some
tissues
now where
was I
yeah you know
the dreaming
the dreaming context
is like
it's so many
different things
it's very profound
the dreaming
intelligences
in my view
some neuroscientists
will argue with me
but the dreaming
intelligence is very
profound
very ancient
very powerful
very non-ordinary
and
can help us
learn to
experiment
with
not
flipping out
when novelty
arises
and I want to be
very clear
that
I'm not
suggesting people
do psychedelic
drugs
and
or even
sing their
praises
by
bias
in this matter
is that we
should have
what I call
endogenous
experience of
the non-ordinary
meaning
without the
introduction
of intoxicants
particularly
strong
intoxicants
because
those things
force us
across the
boundary
what I was
saying earlier
is that
like the
first
number of
times that I
smoked pot
I did not
get high
why was
that
later
when I
was a
runaway
my
closest
friend
was
an
aficionado
of injectable
drugs
primarily
coke and
meth
and I
tried
full doses
of both
of those
drugs
they had
no effect
on me
now one
would imagine
that if you
inject
the correct
dosage of
meth
into a
98 pound
14 year
old boy
boy's
arms
right
if I
if someone's
doing that to
me because
that's what I'm
describing here
with my
you know
complicity
I wanted to
get high
find out what
this high was
like
one would
imagine that
that's just
going to have
a mechanical
effect
well
three attempts
no effect
two with
cocaine
no effect
snort the
drug
total effect
inject the
drug
no effect
and someone
could say
like ah
you didn't
hit the
vein or
whatever
but
they're
wrong
in that
they're wrong
about that
thankfully
I like to
think that
something was
protecting me
from an
experience that
would be so
compelling
that I would
continue chasing
it
I was vulnerable
to various forms
of addiction
which probably
started with
sugar
and fat
and then
moved up to
tobacco
and weed
and weed
was
you know
in my teenage
years
a drug of
choice
but again
what I'm
arguing is
that
what we
want is
endogenous
experience
and there
are lots
of ways
to make
that happen
that are
easy
to access
we want
endogenous
experience
of the
non-ordinary
so that
we
are familiar
with navigating
the transition
and so forth
and also
so that we
don't become
confused
and think
oh the
drug
the drug
is the
doorway
to enlightenment
or
the drug
is
the drug
the non-ordinary
experience
and the drug
are the same
thing
right
pause for a
moment here
it's a very
dangerous
confusion
right
because it's
going to
wrong foot
consciousness
in a variety
of dramatic
ways
that are
pretty
difficult
to come
back from
not impossible
but tough
and also
the non-ordinary
experience
produced by
the drug
so you can
imagine a
kid who
eats some
mushrooms
and goes
to the mall
or
you know
eats some
mushrooms
and spends
the afternoon
playing a
video game
or even
a little
better
eats some
mushrooms
and spends
the afternoon
making music
you can
imagine
a young
person
doing this
and the
difference
between
that
and
say
an
experience
set up
by people
in a
collective
where
westerners
come and
pay
to experience
some kind
of a
ceremony
perhaps in
the jungle
and the
difference
between
that
and what
some
indigenous
tribe
was doing
in the
jungle
8,000
years ago
4,000
years ago
2,000
years ago
these are
not the
same thing
the western
people imagine
that it's
the drug
that is
the cause
of the
non-ordinary
experience
they're not
precisely
wrong
they're
incompletely
correct
because it
is a
very complex
manifold
of
relationships
anciently
conserved
relationships
that
the
indigenous
people
are
re
re
enacting
remembering
literally
reconnecting
they are
relign
relign
kneeing
kneeing
hand to
hand
to hand
threat
parsing
something
that I
Joe gave
me some
food
with his
hands
but that
means I
was willing
to eat
out of
his hand
which was
probably
not a
wise idea
and of
course one
wouldn't
like to
refuse
because that
could be
considered
an insult
so I
naturally
accepted
the food
threat
parsing
that
now
so yes
what's
going on
ceremonially
look
there's a
very
complex
cloud
of
features
and
potencies
and
memories
and
histories
and
lineages
that
come
together
in an
actual
indigenous
ceremony
in a
way that
is both
natural
quote unquote
and
extremely
old
possibly
you know
thousands
or tens
of thousands
of years
old
so
that's
not the
thing
you can
that's
not the
kind of
thing
you can
actually
package
and sell
to
moderns
successfully
you can
package it
and sell
something
to the
moderns
but
unless
they're
if
they
are
not
if
everybody
isn't
kind
of
all
the
way
in
what
you
the
result
of that
behavior
will not
be
ceremony
it will
be something
else
and it
will
lack
many
dimensions
of
richness
and
depth
that
actual
ceremony
almost
never
lacks
right
it's
almost
impossible
for that
stuff
to be
missing
there
mostly
as
modernity
progresses
less
less
impossible
but
so
nonetheless
we
are
born
with
a
broad
array
of
faculties
and
abilities
that only
awaken
in
that are
unlikely
to awaken
outside
of ceremony
some
people
awaken
them
outside
of ceremony
these
people
we
think
of
as
psychic
or
we
have
words
for
them
not
necessarily
intelligent
words
but yes
we have
words
for these
people
sorcerers
witches
warlocks
mages
magi
kings
queens
princes
avatars
all these
all these
words
so I
think
we
should
learn
to
introduce
each
other
gently
to
the
non
ordinary
from
a
position
in
where
we
go
you
know
from
ordinary
waking
consciousness
into
light
non
ordinary
awareness
the
noticing
of
that
the
exploration
of
that
the
deepening
of that
over
time
right
sort
of
like
teaching
a
kid
to
swim
I
prefer
the
gentle
version
to
you know
the stories
I've heard
from some
young men
usually men
where
you know
their possibly
drunken
redneck
father like
threw them
off a
bridge
or something
when they
were
you know
five
or whatever
yeah
I much
prefer
and you
know
this is
something we
do not
want to
do with
psychedelics
we don't
want to
you know
young men
can be
dangerously
disoriented
and think
oh it'll be
really funny
to watch
Johnny go
out of his
mind
if we
give him
LSD
and etc
or whatever
right
yeah in
some cases
Johnny
never came
back
that can
go wildly
south
though
probably
in most
cases
it doesn't
go too
badly
it sort
of depends
on
lots of
variables
including
how
Johnny's
consciousness
is
ordinarily
structures
itself
or
doesn't
but
yeah
that's
not a
good
idea
you know
certainly
don't
want
young
teenagers
who may
have
predilections
for various
modes of
unusually
organized
consciousness
to be
suddenly
subjected
to
something
that
could
you know
set up
a feedback
process
that doesn't
come to
a conclusion
lots of
dangers
including
the danger
of just
associating
ecstasy
with
intoxication
you know
why do
we
why are
we prone
to addiction
as animals
and so forth
there's a variety
of reasons
but the
primary problem
is that our
ordinary
experience
is not
engaging
and does
not call
us into
being
and into
meaningful
roles
and learning
and play
and discovery
and adventure
it's kind
of dead
inside
the whole
modernity
thing
and so
obviously
we can
learn to
displace the
desire for
fulfilling
roles
and meaningful
agency
into
intoxication
or
what's the
right word
nervous habits
right
depiliations
and pulls
their hairs
out
or
I think
that smoking
cigarettes
is
not
entirely
dissimilar
because
it's
it's both
very
it's extremely
compelling
it
causes
a break
from
whatever
stimuli
right
especially
these days
you used
to be able
to smoke
while you
work
or eat
or whatever
nowadays
you've got
to go
outside
to smoke
in most
places
so it
enforces
a break
from
and there's
a sort
of
a very
powerful
feeling
aspect
of intimate
self-relation
that is similar
to like
if you were
depiliating
some part
of your
body
we're
picking
at a
scab
so I
think
it's
compensatory
and what
we're
trying
to do
is
sort
of like
there's
a desert
inside
us
there's
this
time
interval
that we
don't know
how long
it will
be
where
there's
a
profound
impoverishment
of relation
with self
the world
and other
with identity
and so forth
and
this leads
us to
a coping
mechanism
right
it's not
dissimilar
in a way
to
it sort
of reminds
me of
the yolk
of an
egg
right
you've
got to
go through
this process
where you'll
develop
inside the
egg
of course
the yolk
of the
egg
is
probably
natural
and good
and
whereas
the tobacco
is not
particularly
the kinds
that we
use
in cigarettes
and so
forth
so
yeah
there's
this sort
of coping
thing
which
was
clear
to me
long
before
because
from my
own
inquiries
into
addiction
it became
very clear
that
it was a
coping
mechanism
to cope
primarily
with
lack
of
nourishing
rejuvenating
social
and behavioral
intellectual
and creative
endeavors
okay
what am I
going to do
about that
so I
could just
turn it
off
yes I
will
so yeah
we don't
want to
I don't
want people
to have
the impression
that
psychedelic
drugs
are
the
you know
light switch
to
enlightenment
which they
certainly
aren't
I
talk to a
lot of
people
who've
done
psychedelic
drugs
run some
of the
numbers
how many
of these
people
seem like
they're
enlightened
or can
even say
anything
really
meaningful
about
their
psychedelic
experience
or
give us
insight
or
whatever
very few
in my
experience
not none
but
few
so yeah
I'm not
sure
I'm all
the way
in on
that
you know
there's some
question
whether
as well
whether we
can just
certainly
we can
we can
curate
ceremony
like
activity
together
what you
can't
do
I think
is invent
something
that's
40,000
years old
like it
turns out
that
the
incredible
antiquity
the
genius
loci
of
time
and
place
can
be
honored
but
they
can't
be
invented
so
there
are
ways
to
experience
and pursue
learning
and understanding
and awareness
and growth
and
non-ordinary
experience
together
that are
relatively
virtuous
they're
good
but the
ancient
traditions
have
you know
like 50
features
that you
can't just
make up
right
you can't
just go
like
well if
they did
it this
way
and we
do it
this
way
it
should
work
because
it's
a
machine
that's
not
how
those
things
are
so we
should
honor
ancient
traditions
I think
and
authentically
with reverence
and humility
if we
are so
inclined
approach
the keepers
of those
traditions
to see
if we
can have
a role
in
their
rejuvenation
and their
sustenance
and their
survival
in human
experience
you know
where
we're
reasonably
appropriate
or not
not
directly
inappropriate
and we
can also
invent
ways
of
structuring
entering
the
non-ordinary
the
spiritual
the
ceremonial
the
ancient
lineages
of
relationships
together
that is
intelligent
and
insightful
reverent
and
playful
and
beautiful
and that
is certainly
what I
hope for
in my
own
life
and in
my
relationships
with
others
who are
similarly
oriented
I have
traveled
many
branches
thank you
for those
of you
who stayed
the course
with me
I'm so
grateful
as always
to share
this time
together
I wish
you
beautiful
everything
in your
life
your life
path
your
relationships
your home
your dreaming
the economic
concerns
and that
I
fundamentally
wish
for beautiful
adventures
for you
and those
you love
and I
look forward
to learning
together
again
sometime
soon
bye bye
for now
going
to kill you
and
me
don't
