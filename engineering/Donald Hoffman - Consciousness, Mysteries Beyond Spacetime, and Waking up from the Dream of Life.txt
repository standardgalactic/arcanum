what we call the physical world is nothing but a headset inside consciousness so to to just see how
dramatic the change is most of us myself included have think of ourselves as tiny little objects in
the vast space-time billions of light years across this you know the nearest galaxy is 2.4 million
light years away and that's the nearest galaxy and and they they go off so i'm just this little
tiny tiny trivial little chunk of matter in this vast billions of light years across universe
space-time that's that's the way i thought and and now what i'm realizing is is the other way around
space-time is a tiny little data structure in my consciousness and i create it on the fly as i need
so that's how outrageous what i'm saying is to be very very explicit and and maybe to shock people
i'm a cognitive neuroscientist but i'll say this neurons do not exist when they're not perceived
because nothing inside space-time exists when it's not perceived space-time itself does not exist when
it's not perceived it is only a data structure that exists when you create it in your consciousness
that's what that that's the shocking and that's what i've been having a difficult time emotionally
wrapping myself around intellectually i'm there the math has completely convinced me our best science
condition this is true we'll see when my emotions come along for the ride
donald welcome to the show thank you very much neil thanks for having me
what would you say the central question that's been driving your research the past few decades has been
uh well i guess a couple little intertwined themes one is do we see reality as it is because i my
background is in visual perception and perception more generally so that's a really interesting
question what is the relationship between perception and reality and the other interacting theme is um what
is consciousness and how is conscious experience related to everyday life in the physical world
um and neuroscience so those have been the the two big themes that i've been pursuing and they turned
out that they seem to be interacting uh the answer to one seems to affect the answer to the other
you're uh you're pursuing a couple of quite easy questions there i have to say
um what's underneath this uh this search before we started recording you mentioned you know you come from uh
uh quite a religious when you grew up you grew up in quite a religious background was there what's been
underneath this this desire for for truth and this search yes i my father was for several years a
fundamentalist christian minister um holy ghost you know holy roller kind of kind of thing and so i was
exposed to that uh and but then in in at school i was being exposed to science classes and they were
saying contradictory things the church the earth was 4 000 years old in science class it was
millions or billions of years old and and you know there's that's not uh easy to reconcile and so
i realized that there was this big conflict and as a teenager you know it's hard to
at least for me it was hard to figure out how to reconcile these two things but i decided that i
needed to do that and i wanted to understand you know the nature of consciousness and the nature of
human beings what are we just machines that that came to be the question that i formulated for myself
are we just machines or is there something more the spiritual side seemed to say there was something more
the science seemed to say we're just machines and so i thought that's if the science convinced me
that we're just machines then then maybe the spiritual stuff is you know there's not much to
save there but if there's something about us that's beyond machines then that's then that's
interesting doesn't mean the spiritual side that i was taught was right but it means that there could
be some parts of it that could be saved uh and so that was the question i was asking myself as a
teenager are we just machines and i was taking programming classes this is back when programming
was fairly brand new i started programming in 1974 uh and and so that was we had to use we didn't even
have punch cards we had to use cards that we bubbled in by hand with with pencils and and so forth
so i wrote progress so i so i was aware of the of the programming and then i worked at hughes aircraft
as an undergraduate at ucla i worked at hughes aircraft programming military microprocessors in
machine code again starting off with punch cards but eventually the miracle of floppy disks came around
so i was i was into the computer and i realized that it was artificial intelligence was what i really
needed to understand could we build human ais that were equivalent to us that were that were us
and and so i found out about research going on at mit in the artificial intelligence lab
and with david maher and of course marvin minsky was the head of the lab and it was an incredible
group there so i was fortunate enough to go to mit in 1979 be in the artificial intelligence lab and
and also the um was now the brain and cognitive science department so i was looking at the human
side with the neuroscience and the machine side with the artificial intelligence
intelligence uh as were many other people right that's what mit was doing and so i i was that was
how i began to try to you know tackle this problem are we just machines and i i you know intellectually
you have to be honest yeah you just have to say i don't know and let's go wherever the science um and
logic lead us we you know what one thing i could not do was something i had been taught
in the spiritual in my particular spiritual training i'm not saying this is true of all spiritual
training but in my particular spiritual training was we were taught that we had been told the absolute
truth and you should not listen to anything else and i knew that that couldn't be right that that
that wasn't right so i i needed to take a more open mind and say sure i need to listen to what the
spiritual side says but there's no absolute truth here and and you know it's so so that was the one
thing where i clearly departed from what i'd been taught and i think it was absolutely critical to you
know you have to think for yourself um and and go wherever um the evidence reason and logic will take
you and so so i did that and did my phd at mit on a specific problem uh you know you can't just tackle
the big big questions you know you're not going to get your your phd because you won't get anything
done so you so i tackled the question of how do we see in in 3d and recognize objects i tackled one
aspect of that seeing in three dimensions and and recognizing objects which um is of course still
an interesting and open problem you know to get self-driving cars that's what we need
you are you know computers that can see through cameras and and see in 3d and recognize what
they're doing so they don't run over people and don't run into parked cars on the road and so forth
so so i so i was grappling with that problem in my dissertation but what i realized was that
doing that gave me a real deeper understanding of the mathematics that underlies perception
right most of us have no idea what's going on under the hood when you just open your eyes
and look around you you know it looks like well you just take a picture of what's out there how hard
how hard could it be it's you know it's a camera it takes a picture well give me brakes there's nothing
to it well if that's all there was to it we would have self-driving cars already with that could see
and wouldn't we wouldn't be having the slow rollout of autonomous vehicles that we're having much much
slower than people expected it's really really hard and and then when you realize that you know
you have billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are involved just in vision again
you know that's not just a camera that's that's that's pretty expensive piece of hardware that's
that's working there so so that wakes you up to what's going on that it's it's not just a picture
taking process it's a const in some sense a construction process you're getting an image at
the eye which you know your eye has maybe 130 million photoreceptors so you can think of it's
like 130 million megapixel you know 130 megapixel camera and but if you look at the output of the
camera it's just a bunch of numbers you don't see you know a person riding a bicycle and tables and
chairs you just see a bunch of numbers it's this bright at this location it's this color at this
location you've got to take all those numbers and turn it into a a visual world that that you can
actually navigate so that's the real trick and so i came to terms with how much is going on there
that is construction process not just a mere photographic process and then that raised the
question oh if it's a construction process how accurate is the construction is it a reconstruction of
reality or is it a de novo construction that maybe is unrelated to objective reality and the latter
seemed unlikely to me but you know i just needed to prove it and i just needed to understand okay
so of course the idea was we reconstruct reality that was what i was taught that's what we believed
at mit that you it's a it's a construction process but it's a reconstruction of reality
but then as i started you know thinking about evolution and other things i began to wonder
about that it's like you know evolution does things on the cheap fast and cheap you know where you're
trying to save calories and save time so you're going to use heuristics and shortcuts you're going to
cheat and so maybe the idea then was well maybe we cheat sometimes but most of the time on the important
stuff we're reconstructing reality so i thought about that and i went back and forth and i finally
came to the conclusion that it seemed unlikely with what i knew about perception research and from
the ai point of view that any of our constructions were the truth but in 2008 i decided i need to
settle this with evolution i need to actually ask a technical question what is the probability that
evolution of a natural selection has shaped any sensory system of any organism to ever see any aspect of
objective reality truly what's the probability of that clean technical question and when darwin
formulated his theory in the 19th century he didn't formulate it as a mathematical theory
so darwin couldn't have answered that question with mathematical precision but john maynard smith and
others in in the 1970s took darwin's ideas and used evolution evolution what they came up with was
evolutionary game for use game theory and evolution together to create the field of evolutionary game
theory a very very powerful mathematical theory so darwin's ideas are now mathematically precise
and so we can now ask the technical question what's the probability that any sensory system
has been shaped to see the truth some aspect of the truth at all and i i went into it thinking well
probably there'll be problems because you know it getting the truth takes a lot of time and a lot
of calories so we're probably going to be doing things cheaply and quickly and so we'll probably be
you know approximating the truth but not really getting the truth and that was sort of what i
expected going into it and i got a couple great wonderful graduate students brian marion and justin
mark to work with me and some others i mean chetan precaution others work with me manish singh so it's
not just me it was a bunch of group of people with mathematics and we and we went at it and what we
discovered when we actually did the mathematics and the simulations was sure yeah you know there are
selection pressure to do things fast and cheap and and that will compromise reality you know but
that wasn't the real what we discovered was this the the payoff functions when you in evolution it's
you think about it as like a game and you know as you're playing the game you're competing with
others and and the point of this game is to as reproductive success right you're trying you don't
get to the next level of the game yourself but your offspring your genes go to the next level of
the game if you succeed and and so the the idea was that there are these payoff functions that govern
effectively how many points you get in the game of life and if you get more points than the
competition then you have a greater probability of you know having offspring in the next generation
so so it's the payoff functions that are the critical thing and if you're going to be shaped
to see the truth then the payoff functions must have information about that truth if they're going
to shape you so that that became the clean technical question what's the probability that a fitness payoff
function uh has information about structures that you know could be in the world like now it gets a
little mathematical like like total orders partial orders metrics topologies measurable structures there are all
sorts of mathematical structures that you can imagine that the world has in each case case you can ask
the technical question what's the probability that a randomly chosen payoff function um would actually
um have what we call homomorphism or contain information about that structure and the answer is
zero the probability is zero in case after case you look at it the probability is is zero and and in fact um
um even for things that are sort of close to homomorphisms in many cases the probability is is vanishing
vanishingly small so so that that was a shock to the system we haven't been shaped to see the truth
and that shock then has reverberations for the problem of consciousness
because what it means is what we're perceiving when we perceive a spatial temporal world of 3d of space
one dimension of time and we're seeing physical objects in space and time and so forth
we're not seeing reality as it is with probability one we're not seeing reality as it is
that's that's whatever that that is if you buy darwin's theory
and so that means that space-time isn't fundamental space-time is just a form of our perceptions and
physical objects inside space-time aren't fundamental they also are just the way i think about it now is
it's like a virtual reality headset that evolution gave us to play the game of life right if you're if
you're trying to play a game uh like uh vr grand theft auto or something like that with with your
friends what you're really doing in this metaphor is you're toggling millions of voltages in some
supercomputer right but if you had to do that if you had to toggle the voltages in the precise sequence
you couldn't win the game you would lose the game someone who just has a virtual reality headset
with a you know steering wheel and dashboard and gas pedal and so forth is going to win over someone
who sees the truth and is toggling voltages and so so i think what evolution is teaching us
is what what we evolved was not an insight into truth but a vr headset space-time is our headset
so instead of consciousness and its physical substrate which is which most conscious researchers
are thinking about is consciousness and its physical substrate i think about it as consciousness and its
physical headset and that's a complete change because if if the brain is the physical substrate of
consciousness that means the brain is fundamental something not conscious is fundamental and consciousness
is arising out of it but if we take evolution financial selection seriously then the brain is merely an icon
in our headset it's not the truth and it has no causal powers so so i'm a cognitive neuroscientist
i love neuroscience i study neuroscience and i've done a joint work on fmri and eeg studies of the brain
and then lots of computational modeling and so forth i'm very much into the brain and i love cognitive
neuroscience and i think it needs more funding because it's far more complicated than we thought we
thought when we look in brains we see neurons and synapses and there's 86 billion neurons and roughly the same
number of glial cells and trillions of synapses that's complicated but it turns out that's trivial
compared to what's beyond it that's just a vr headset to something deeper what we the neurons are
just the headset version of a deeper reality that we as scientists need to understand so we need more
money for neuroscience not less because we're just scratching the surface of what's going on when we look
inside brains so so that changes the whole game for consciousness because you know my friends and
colleagues and i'm friends with most of the people in in this field or colleagues certainly
who are studying consciousness most of them assume that physical systems like brains or ai's
with the right either functional or functional properties or causal structure and so forth
um that that substrate with the right causal structure or functional properties uh somehow
the unconscious system gives rise to consciousness like the unconscious uh system of neurons in the
brain and their whatever pattern of activity they have whether it's a causal thing or a functional thing
that gives rise to consciousness and what i'm saying is our best science you know evolution of natural
selection is telling us that space time isn't fundamental and objects inside space time are
simply icons in the vr headset that we're somehow creating so that whole approach now which is the
approach that i that i first thought was the right approach i mean that's i went into the field
thinking we're going to find the the neural basis of consciousness i i now think that that's it's not
going to work now of course i think we need to study neuroscience and we need to study the neural
correlates of consciousness absolutely i'm all for that but the the the direction of explanation is going
to go the other way instead of explaining consciousness in terms of neurons we're going to be having
have to have a theory of consciousness itself that explains why we see things that we call neurons and
glial cells when we look inside what we call brains so it's going to have to go the other the other way
so again i'm a small minority i you know i would say 98 99 of my colleagues and friends who are
studying consciousness are physicalists uh functionalists or or you're you're like in the
case of iit they're saying some kind of substrate um some physical substrate with some kind of causal
structural organization um that that somehow then is either gives rise to or is identical to
explanatorily identical to consciousness and i'm saying there is no substrate to consciousness no
physical substrate to consciousness what we call the physical world is nothing but a headset inside
consciousness so so to to just see how dramatic the change is most of us myself included have think
of ourselves um as tiny little objects in the vast space-time billions of light years across this you
know the the nearest galaxy is 2.4 million light years away and that's the nearest galaxy and and they they
go off you know it's just like so i'm just this little tiny tiny trivial little chunk of matter in
this vast billions of light years across universe space-time that's that's the way i thought and and
now what i'm realizing is is the other way around space-time is a tiny little data structure in my
consciousness and i create it on the fly as i need so it's a comp so so that's how outrageous what i'm
saying is it's it's it's not small now sorry sorry i just want to quickly ask there donald how has that
change in perception changed how you felt in the world because that's a massive flip on understanding
who you are well it's it's caused a a big conflict in me because
we're all just born knowing that we're little tiny objects in a big space time that's the reality that
we just know we are it's it's it's there's no question about it and in fact piaget talks about
object permanence little children get he thought at 18 months they get object permanence later research
showed it's more like three or four months we we're born to believe that objects exist whether or
not they're perceived my teddy bear when you put it behind a pillow still exists and i believe that that
that that that you know there's nothing that disappears uh in reality when it disappears from
my sight and so letting go of object permanence is letting go of something i was wired to believe at
four months of age so so it's it's it's not trivial me so what what i find is really interesting to see in
myself when i'm thinking clearly about it and i look at our best theories of evolution and i'll mention
physics in a moment because i'm treading on their territory clearly so i'll talk about what the
physicists say but when i look at what our best science is saying it looks to me like
yeah space-time is not fundamental and therefore objects in space-time do not create
my consciousness it must be the other way around so but but when i am not thinking my natural reaction
is to go back and and i'm just a little tiny 160 pound body in space-time and i'm you know and what
i see is the truth and and and so forth so so it's it's really so i i do meditate and that's that's
that's helping me to let go of my prior assumptions but i must say they they don't go quietly so when
people look at what i say and say that's complete nonsense i say i completely agree it feels like
nonsense to me too emotionally it feels like complete nonsense what i'm saying but that's
what science is about science is taking our best ideas making them absolutely precise and then following
wherever it leads even if we don't like where it leads and so that's that's what we have to do and
just to emphasize what we're essentially saying here is that if you accept evolution and and
mathematics as true if you accept those two things as true then you also have to accept or not have to
accept but it's also true that the reality we see is an illusion we're not actually seeing what's there
is that is that fair to say yeah i would yes and i would just make a slight thing i i don't need to
claim that evolution is true all i need to do is say it's the best theory we have so far okay right so
if you accept evolution then you have to accept this as well evolution in in entails this now i should
say that um there is an issue that's been raised by philosophers that i should mention here so a number
of philosophers and i won't mention them by name um i don't want to impugn anybody have published papers
where they they say that what i've just argued is logically self-contradictory and and the argument
they they go they give is this they say look hoffman is saying that um he's used evolutionary game
theory to show that space-time and its physical objects are not are not fundamental that they're not
you know what we see is just an illusion it's not fundamental reality now darwin's theory
assumes that objects in space-time like organisms and resources are fundamental
that's what his theory assumes so he's assuming that space-time and his physical objects are
fundamental now the argument that philosophers give is this either the mathematics of evolutionary game
theory faithfully represents darwin's ideas or it does not now if it does not then hoffman of course
wouldn't want to use it to try to prove anything about what it darwin's theory entails so and if
evolutionary game theory mathematics does faithfully represent darwin's ideas then it couldn't possibly
contradict his assumption that physical objects like organisms and resources exist and are real so
either way hoffman's shot himself in the foot logically that what they like to say is it's he's in an
unfortunate dialectical situation but but basically he's so stupid he shot himself in the foot um logically
so so and this is um more than one philosopher has actually published this this this argument so this
is uh and i think then other philosophers i've talked with say yeah i i buy that argument so so here's why
the argument is false it misunderstands scientific theories what is a scientific theory scientific theory
says please grant me these assumptions and if you grant me these assumptions then i can explain all this
other wonderful stuff very very simple assumptions and then explanations what this means is there cannot
possibly be a scientific theory of everything because you don't explain your assumptions you assume them
you don't explain them so now you can say well i can give you a new deeper theory that explains the
assumptions of your previous theory yes you can and your new theory will have its own new assumptions
and this goes on ad infinitum so this is horrible news for those who want a theory of everything in
science there is no such thing it's great news for job security for scientists it means that we
will never ever be done we will always be building new theories and what this means about any scientific
theory is that it has if it's a good theory it has a certain scope of explanation but it also means
that it will have definite limits no scientific theory is a theory of everything so it will have limits
so the a good theory gives you the mathematical tools to explore its scope
a great theory gives you the mathematical tools to discover its limits so einstein's theory of space
time you know both special and general relativity one of the key ideas that is that uh you know the
speed of light is the same for all observers and the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames
and and so einstein is using his assumption is that space time is fundamental either flat space time or
curved space time but space time is fundamental and then he writes down all sorts of interesting
equations the lawrence transformations on the one in this flat space and and you know the equations of
general relativity in the curve now you might say okay well is einstein's theory just a good theory or is
it a great theory does it have the tools to actually show the limits of the very concept of space time
itself it turns out to einstein's dismay it's a great theory what we discovered is that einstein's theory
together with just another thing that Einstein came up with um you know energy is proportional to
the frequency of a particle uh entails that that space time falls apart at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters
and 10 to the minus 43 seconds at the plank scale so einstein's own mathematics
is good it tells you the scope the incredible scope of his mathematics of space time sorry
donald can i just ask you to sort of confirm what you mean by space time falls apart at
at that figure what does that actually mean that it falls apart at that
it means that space time has no operational meaning there's no experiment that you can do that would have
any outcome if you're trying to measure things that's smaller than 10 to the minus 33 centimeters
or 10 to the minus 43 seconds so so and the problem is this as you go to smaller and smaller scales of
space how do you do that well you have to get bigger and bigger microscopes to look smaller and smaller
but what does that mean it means that you're effectively using smaller and smaller wavelengths
of light or some kind of radiation but let's talk about light you have to get the wavelengths smaller
and smaller and smaller to resolve smaller smaller things in space time and that's fine quantum
mechanics allows you to do that but but einstein told us that e equals h new as you get the smaller
smaller wavelengths the energy is going up then einstein also told us the energy equals mass
so the mass is going up you're getting more and more energy therefore more and more mass inside
a smaller and smaller region of space and then general relativity kicks in and gives you a black hole
at some point and so at that when you get to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters the very thing you're
trying to say measure some tiny tiny particle well by the time you get to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters
you destroy whatever you're trying to measure you turn it into a black hole and if you get frustrated
and say well i'm going to try to smaller wavelength and put more energy into it the black hole just gets
bigger and bigger and bigger so so space time there's literally no meaning that you can give to 10 to
the minus 36 centimeters has no meaning there's nothing you can do there it literally has no operational
meaning so einstein's own mathematics that einstein himself wrote down to model his intuitions about
space-time come back and tell us the limits of einstein's very fundamental concept of space-time itself
it says that concept is fine as long as you're dealing with stuff bigger than 10 to the minus 33
centimeters at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and smaller space-time falls apart is by the way
that's pretty shallow it's 10 to the minus 33 centimeters not 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters
just 10 to the minus 33 centimeters so space-time it turns out an einstein's theory is a very very shallow
data structure really really shallow data structure but this is how science works you take your intuitions
you turn them into a mathematical theory if the theory is a good theory it allows you to explore
the scope of the theory like gps comes out of you know the the technology gps depends on certain
features of einstein's theory of general relativity but if it's a great theory then the theory will
actually give you the tools to find the limits of that theory so so now to come back to the the
philosopher's arguments against me they're saying again their argument is that you know hoppen's
using the mathematics of evolutionary game theory to show that the very fundamental concepts of jarwin
cannot be fundamental in in the they're they're gonna have to let go of those at some point they're
not fundamental to the nature of reality and they're saying i'm shooting myself in the foot you
couldn't possibly do that and what i'm saying is no what you're missing is this is the way science works
the good science takes mathematical theories and and uses the mathematics to find the limits of
those theories so that we don't get stuck in a rut with with one theory it allows us to go beyond
so so i'm not shooting myself in the foot i'm just doing what science has to do now what the old theory
can't do is tell you what you should do next once you found the limit once we know that spacetime
isn't fundamental and you say okay so well what's outside of spacetime and what could that even
possibly mean to say that there's something outside of spacetime isn't everything inside
spacetime what is what could you possibly be meaning well spacetime itself isn't going to tell
you because spacetime has its set of assumptions namely that spacetime is fundamental well what you're now
questioning is that you're saying spacetime isn't fundamental so i've got to step outside of
einstein's set of concepts to get a new set of concepts and the restriction then will be whatever new
theory i come up with it has to give me back einstein's theory of spacetime as some special projection
and by the way uh physicists are already doing this so the european research council
in the last few months announced a 10 million euro project called universe plus and it's the goal of
that is to find the new mathematical framework for for physics and the framework they're saying beyond
spacetime and beyond auto mechanics and the reason they're doing this is that roughly 10 years ago 11 years
ago they discovered these structures called positive they call positive geometries entirely outside of
spacetime entirely beyond quantum mechanics there are no hilbert spaces in these structures so there's
no quantum mechanics there's no hilbert spaces but they give rise to the right answers to scattering
experiments like you know particles in the large hadron collider smashing into each other you know
gluons smashing in and gluons spraying out and so so forth you get the right answers the math becomes
much easier when you let go of spacetime math can i'm not not to say that's easy but much much easier
than when you do it in spacetime and you see new symmetries so they've been discovering just in the
last decade physicists have been and i should say high energy theoretical physicists many physicists who
aren't high energy theoretical physicists don't even know about this i mean i've talked with many quantum
theorists for example who simply don't know about this so it's a small branch but it's those physicists
who work physicists who are dealing with the edges of spacetime's abilities right the high energy
theoretical physicists are the ones who are probing physics where spacetime starts to fall apart and so
they're the ones that are moving out to these new structures beyond spacetime called positive geometries
and something called decorated permutations so so it's not just some cognitive scientist saying we need to do
this the erc is funding this to the tune of 10 million dollars 10 million euros they had in february
their first meeting with over a hundred mathematicians and mathematical physicists on board to launch this
new field of positive geometries outside of spacetime so yes we can go outside of spacetime it seems like
ridiculous what could you even be talking about i've mentioned this to people and they have no idea what
i'm even talking about what could possibly be meant by something outside of spacetime space time is
everything nope that's a conceptual dead end thinking of spacetime as everything is a conceptual dead end we can
in fact use mathematics and go entirely outside of spacetime and just to emphasize um what we're talking about
here in your last uh conversation with us with annal seth as well you mentioned that what would have taken pages and pages and pages of
uh mathematical equations using uh the framework of quantum quantum physics or spacetime you can get the
same result or a better result using um like maybe a few lines of of equations one page four four or five
terms on a page that you can write down by hand and compute by hand the other you couldn't even do it with
supercomputers this you can do by hand that's pretty crazy so and the implications then for consciousness
are all almost all of my colleagues
are assuming that space-time is fundamental and that objects in space-time are fundamental they're
looking for a physical substrate in space-time that's prior to consciousness now it may be prior in
the sense that it has the right causal structures as an integrated information theory or it might be
prior in the sense that has the right functional properties as most as most physicalist theories
are but in any case they're they're what they're assuming either an integrated information theory or
you know global workspace theory or uh higher order theories or orchestrated collapse of quantum states
of neural microtubules like penrose and hemorrhoff these theories are all assuming
that space-time and certain physical substrates or objects inside space-time are fundamental and
consciousness emerges and that now is simply ignoring what physics has revealed space-time is not
fundamental and the substrates namely the physical objects inside space-time are not fundamental and
and erc is and and hundreds of brilliant high energy theoretical physicists are now finding these new
structures beyond space-time the field of consciousness studies is now lagging behind we are basing all of
our research on a outmoded model of reality it's just it's gone and so there's no hope of booting up
consciousness from neural activity or or from the causal structure of substrates inside space-time
or the functional properties of substrates inside space-time it's not possible
why because space-time itself is merely a trivial and shallow data structure and the objects inside of
it for example what are particles when you ask what is a physical particle like a you know a quark
by bosons leptons and quarks the the elementary particles of the standard model physicists will
tell you that they're just irreducible representations of the group of symmetries of space-time
if you give me a space-time
its symmetries dictate the properties of its particles and what the particles are
so the particles themselves when when space-time is doomed so are the particles because they're they're
just representations of the symmetries of space-time so we're trying to boot up consciousness from the
particles you know complicated assemblies of particles that are just representations of a space-time
that is itself a shallow data structure not the truth so the whole enterprise of of trying to build
consciousness from some physical substrate either a causal substrate or a functional substrate is doomed and
the physicists are the ones who are telling us that and and i'm saying also that evolution by natural
selection darwin's theory agrees when you use evolutionary game theory it agrees so the the main
pillars of modern science you know high energy theoretical physics and quantum field theory
together with einstein's theory of gravity and then darwin's theory of evolution of natural selection are
both are there are greatest theories because in some sense they they have the mathematics that tells us
space-time was a wonderful framework for centuries and it's over it's time to get a new and deeper
framework and for better or for worse what i'm trying to do is get a mathematical model of consciousness
while consciousness outside of space-time and my goal is to show that so it's like a a social network
of interacting consciousnesses so so the mathematics is is network theory very much it's all about networks the
mathematics of networks and stochastic processes on networks that's that's the the work that we're
doing and what we're trying to do is show mathematically that the positive geometries
and the decorated permutations that the high energy theoretical physicists have found outside of space
time actually are projections of the network properties of an even bigger dynamics of conscious agents so the
physicists are going from space-time outward and they're finding when we when we take off the space
time headset what do we see we see positive geometries well who ordered that this this is a little
green we take off our headset and what do we see it's like in 2001 a space odyssey the movie right where
there's an obelisk and all the apes are hooting and hollering and pounding on you know they know it's
important it's really pregnant with me but they have no idea what it means well that's where we are
we've we've taken off our headset we look outside of space-time what do we see obelisks these geometric
objects they're static geometric that's these positive geometries are like the amplituhedron the
sociohedron cosmological poly like polytopes and so forth these are like obelisks outside of space-time
that and they're sitting there you know sort of staring at us silently and what do they mean the the
physicists you know there's no dynamics it's just these objects sitting there who ordered that and
then these permutations the decorated permutations that classify the objects so what we're saying is
well we need a dynamical system outside of all of this yeah how about a network of conscious agents
interacting we've made the map we've made the map into the um the decorated permutations we're working
on the positive geometries a lot of this revolves around your theory of conscious agents as well what is
a conscious agent in like in really simple terms like why would you describe that to someone hearing
that for the first time that's right so so our proposal then is that space-time is doomed
so space-time can't boot up consciousness why don't we start with consciousness being fundamental let's
have a theory where consciousness is fundamental no substrates no substrates whatsoever consciousness
just is the fun so if you're thinking about making a theory of consciousness you might say well there's
lots of stuff that that theory has to do there's qualia there's choice there's learning memory problem
solving intelligence the self there's tons and tons of stuff what are you going to do how do you how do
you build a theory of consciousness that's not you know coming you know emerging from some substrate either
causally or functionally so what we are doing is what you have to do with any science pick the minimal
minimal assumptions because the more you assume the less you explain so you want you know occam's razor
do with as little as possible so we chose two things there are experiences so we're we're just saying
there are content you know the the taste of chocolate the smell of garlic the color red
that's our fundamental furniture of the unit of our universe not a space not a space-time universe
something a universe outside of space-time there are there are experiences um and experiencers you know
having those experiences and there are probabilistic relationships among experiences that's it what if i
experience red what's the probability that i might experience green next that's it no notion of self
learning memory problem solving intelligence in in any we don't assume any of that just so if people
want to see the math we have a paper called objects of consciousness you can just google objects of
consciousness the math is there also fusions of consciousness they're free online so you can see
what what we're doing and it turns out that we get a social network of interacting conscious agents the
for all i'll just say one sentence of math for those who want a little bit of beef the we measure we
model the spaces of possible experiences with problem probability spaces
measurable spaces and the interactions you know the probabilistic interactions among experiences with
markovian kernels so for and and it turns out our network model is computationally universal
so it means even though we don't assume learning memory problem solving and so forth we can build
models of agents that only have our two little assumptions experiences and probabilistic relationships
among experiences we can build models of learning memory well anything you can do with neural nets
you can do with conscious agent nets they're they're equally powerful as content as neural nets so we
have networks of conscious agents but the key difference is neural nets are inside space-time
they're networks of physical objects inside space-time conscious agent networks are networks of
consciousnesses that have no physical substrate and are entirely outside of space-time and that create space-time
space-time as one of the more trivial user interfaces that they use to interact with each other so what
we countenance is that's our space-time three dimensions of space one dimension of time is a fairly trivial
headset that you know the subconscious agents use to interact right think about it like the twitterverse
there are millions of users and billions of tweets there's no way that anybody could read all the
tweets or interact with all the users so we we have to have something that to you know calm things
down to to make it understandable and so we'll do they look at trends and so forth but ultimately what
we'd like to have is some some kind of like headset that allows us to see what's happening in wisconsin
versus tokyo or whatever uh to and that's what space-time is it's just a little headset a little um
data compression scheme and data understanding scheme that some um conscious agents use to understand
their interactions with others but i don't see any reason that is special in fact it seems to me one
of the more trivial headsets why not have 50 dimensions of space why not have 50 billion why be stuck with
space at all you know so i i think that you know once we once we get rid of our um blinders in our
addiction to space-time which we're born with so i understand how hard it is to get rid of it
but once we let go of that then our scientific creativity can can go where we want okay i'm
still trying to wrap my head around this so we're are we almost saying that a conscious agent exists
beyond space-time uh but uses space-time as a way to interact with other conscious agents in the same way
that somebody with a virtual reality headset can interact with somebody in a game um in another
part of the world for example is this what kind of what we're saying that that's that's exactly right
so that conscious agents themselves uh are the fundamental idea and
there's a whole essentially an infinite collection of these conscious agents that interact
and we're we're writing a paper right now on a logic that ties them all together so you know so
many spiritual traditions have an idea of of one god or one brahman or or whatever they might want
to call it right some some ultimate consciousness and and it turns out when we when we look at our
conscious agents we're starting off with little trivial ones like this conscious agent has only one
experience it can only see red that's all it can do and this this conscious agent maybe it sees red and
green and this one has 20 experiences that one has 50 and and and we can and and so any experience that
you can imagine we can write down a probable probability structure for it and a markovian
dynamics for it and we can have these interact and when they interact they can combine you can take
simpler agents and they combine in interesting ways to create more complicated agents and so we get this
combination logic that that comes out of it and and we found uh uh in studying this we found a new
mathematical logic on markov kernels the markov chains that we're about to publish it um it turns out
that there's a a logic on all possible markov dynamics that hadn't been discovered before it's a trace
logic for those who know about trace chains they i'll just give the definition one kernel is less than
another if it's the trace of the other that turns out that one definition gives you a non-bullying
logic of all the markovian kernels which in our case gives us a non-bullying logic of all possible
consciousnesses and and what it does is it says there is because it's non-bullying there's no single
top consciousness so there's not what most people would think of as god instead it's far more
interesting there are an infinite number of directions in which you can go infinitely far
in more and more complicated consciousnesses so there's not one top direction there's an
infinite number of directions and and for me if anything sounds closer to what i would think of
by the meaning of god that is much closer to than just having one little thing at the top
having an infinite number of directions so and by the way i'm not smart enough to think of this it was
it was the mathematical logic of the trace the trace order that forced me to let go of my baby
thoughts about bigger and bigger consciousness and it forced me to to think in this new way so that's
that's the goal of science is to get us out of our dogmatic slumbers and and our old ways of thinking and
then force us kicking and screaming sometimes to see a bigger picture and that's what this is doing
okay um so just to clarify so each one of us would potentially then be a conscious agent which means
that and if that's the case does that mean that on some level we each exist outside of space time as
well and this what we're doing right now is a sort of like temporary uh illusion of a deeper reality
that's right so you are a conscious agent but you're also two conscious agents
if you if we cut your corpus callosum in half the you have two hemispheres the left hemisphere and right hemisphere
and they're connected by a band of about 220 million axons called the corpus callosum and a
friend of a friend of mine joe bogan was a surgeon who um to help people with epilepsy sometimes had to
go in and cut the corpus callosum and uh separate the two hemispheres that help with the some problems
with epilepsy and but what they found when they studied these people was that the right hemisphere
you could talk to just the right hemisphere or the left hemisphere and one person for example i think
the right hemisphere um was an atheist and left hemisphere believed in god and the right hemisphere
wanted to be a race car driver the left hemisphere wanted to be a draftsman have a desk job so and and
the two hands the turns out the right hemisphere controls the left hand and the left hemisphere controls
the right hand and sometimes the two hands fought they would fight with each other because they they
you know maybe the person was making an omelet and one hemisphere wanted to have an egg and the
other one didn't want to have an egg and would try to ruin the omelet so it wouldn't it wouldn't be
able to be cooked so so so you're one conscious agent but apparently you're also we have evidence
that you're also two but i think that you're infinitely many but potentially infinitely many conscious
agents yeah there's this whole network of interacting conscious agents and at the same time
you are the one with the whole maybe i shouldn't call it the one but maybe the whole consciousness
in some sense you are the whole consciousness looking at itself through a particular trivial
space-time headset and has your body is just a little avatar in that in that vr that you're through
which you're looking so so this changes the whole thing around instead of you are your body and your brain
is the the source of your consciousness it's the other way around your consciousness is fundamental
and what you call well what you call your body and your brain is merely an avatar that you render when
you need it is you know like an avatar and in a virtual reality game is is you know it's not you
and and it only the hands that you see only exist when you look if you don't look at the hands
those pixels are gone and then there are no hands there's no hands in the computer
so so to be very very explicit and and maybe to shock people i'm a cognitive neuroscientist but i'll
say this neurons do not exist when they're not perceived because nothing inside space-time exists
when it's not perceived space-time itself does not exist when it's not perceived it is only a data
structure that exists when you create it in your consciousness that's what that's the shocking and
that's what i've been having a difficult time emotionally wrapping myself around intellectually
i'm there the math has completely convinced me our best science convinced me this is true
um we'll see when my emotions come along for the ride
i have no idea how you get anything done knowing this like just you must be just sitting all day just
i can't believe this is actually this is actually true you know um but before before we wrap up
here donald i just want to ask a question that i think is important to ask um
if this is the case um
why would consciousness exist what might or maybe the better question is what do you see as
the purpose of human existence then um why would consciousness be having this experience through our
eyes in other words like what what might be going on there that's the fundamental excellent question
in this area i started off by talking about how science there's no theory of everything no set of
concepts no set of theories can never explain any everything and that that's true of my own theory
about consciousness right that's my my theory of consciousness is a first trivial baby step
consciousness is whatever it is my theory is just a trivial theory and it's the first of hopefully
billions of successor theories what this means about consciousness itself is consciousness transcends
any description what science does is build descriptions from certain perspectives that's what we do as
scientists we take a perspective and we build a description
and so what this suggests is there's a deep answer to your question and it comes
there's a theorem that no system can ever fully understand itself if i have a computer for example
and i want the computer to to understand itself completely what would i do well i'd have it build
a model of itself right some software model of itself well in the process the computer itself has
become more complicated because now it's the computer with a model so now i'd have to model a computer
with a model of it and you can see this goes on ad infinitum so it's pretty straightforward
to see maybe not to prove but to see that that no system can fully model itself so tie that together
with the fact that no theory of consciousness can ever get anywhere close to the complete explanation
of consciousness consciousness trans you are consciousness and you transcend so so be very
personal you transcend any scientific theory your consciousness transcends any scientific theory
so what so what is consciousness doing and why what if conscious and first answer i don't know here's
i guess maybe it's educated maybe it's uneducated but it's a guess maybe what consciousness is up to is
knowing itself and the way it knows itself is to say let me choose to project myself
from this direction and look at myself from this direction and when i do that i look it looks like
i'm this little thing called don hoffman that weighs 165 pounds lives in irvine and so forth that's what i
look like but this this i'm just the universal consciousness looking at myself from this point and
or i'm neil or i'm you know whoever i might be that's what and and then i i give myself 70 80 90 years
whatever it might be to you know to look at myself from that now and i like and and maybe to make it
so that i really take that perspective seriously maybe what i do is i let myself completely forget
who i really am let me let me forget who i really am let me really believe that i'm 165 pounds of of
flesh in space and time and really believe that and really be worried about stuff and then and so i
really take this thing and then let me slowly wake up and and reap all the benefits that i got from
that perspective and that the entire life of hoffman is one trivial trivial perspective on who i really
am and each one of the billions of human beings is an important but compared to the whole trivial
perspective on what the consciousness is and and so that's my best answer to your question is that
what consciousness is up to is trying on different avatars trillions quadrillions uncountable numbers
of probably an infinity of different avatars and the space-time headset that we're using is as i've said
probably one of the more trivial ones we're probably really really low on the totem pole of avatars that
consciousness is using very very low right now you know we're like amoebas you know it's really low on
that so but there are there are other avatars with other perspectives that are much more much more
complicated than ours so so in this case in that perspective it's no surprise that i'm having a hard
time with this because the whole point was to give myself a hard time just so i would take this whole
thing seriously and really take this perspective and wake up from it painfully um and and then realize
that um death isn't the end it's just taking off the headset wow okay well that's that's a great note
to end on don um where can people find you online where would you recommend them to go after this
conversation well for for those who are technically minded um i i have you know the objects of consciousness
paper so just google objects of consciousness and fusions of consciousness and then you can you
know google scholar me you can if you do google scholar and type in my name you can see the other
papers that that that we've done on this for by the way if you're if you have a recent phd in mathematics
and in um algebraic geometry and you know these positive geometries i have a postdoc i have two postdoc
positions um that i'm advertising right now for so i i want uh you know someone within two years of a
phd in algebraic geometry to to so email me at dd hoff uci.edu and i'll point you to the um to where
you can apply for a postdoc we want someone to again a recent phd in algebraic geometry last two years
to work with us honest and and for those who are interested in in less technical things i would just
say that i i have a twitter feed so you don hoffman the don hoffman i think i forget what it's called
my twitter my twitter handle um i can i can send it to you my twitter handle so i i do post you know
stuff that i'm thinking about and and and uh i post uh videos like this one i'll post when when it comes
out um if you allow me and youtube videos and so forth so so yeah i guess yeah my my online youtube um
stuff oh and i have a book um the case against reality for those who want to look at the evolution
argument in more detail and see more of the guts of that and i talk a little bit about consciousness
in in that as well fantastic fantastic well another thing i i mentioned to you before recording um
before we started recording was that i think what you're essentially doing i know you're not this isn't
your intention and it's sort of just happening as a byproduct but you are opening the possibility of
mystery in the world and a sense of spirituality in the world to people that otherwise might not
be able to access it you know and i think that's super super important people that are
very sort of intellectual and interested in mathematics and physics and everything else as well
spirituality is not accessible to them but through someone like yourself then they can get in touch with
this very very important thing in life so i think it's super important what you're doing and um
obviously just keep going and best luck with everything going forward too thank you very much
and i agree that ultimately i think there'll be a very profitable interaction between science and
spirituality because mystery is at the heart science tells us that there is no theory of everything it's
very very clear there's no theory of everything that means at the core is a deep deep mystery and you are that mystery
you are not separate from the mystery you are that mystery so i agree with you that science and
spirituality it will be difficult there's a lot of bad history between them but i think eventually
it will be a a very very profitable interaction thank you donald thank you very much yeah thank you for
