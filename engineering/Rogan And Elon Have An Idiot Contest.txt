speaking of scams let's check in on joe rogan uh hosting his i don't know fourth tech billionaire
of the month well it's like andreessen he's had all of them on right sax andreessen zuckerberg
zuckerberg did peter teal show up or is he too shy we should call him nation state media from now on
he was just unrude but i forced myself to watch that it is i think impressive that joe rogan is
able to have such consequential people on and feel such a small obligation to have even the remotest
clue of what he's talking about i haven't watched the whole three hours it's unlikely i will this
part about social security i should just tell you that social security has existed every day that joe
rogan has been alive in fact it pre-dates him probably by 30 30 years at least it is
one of the largest expenditures that our government is involved in now it is self-funding taxes go
directly to social security they fund social security there's been so much written about
social security over the past 90 years so much written by uh republicans because they have been
attacking social security since 1936 i think it was in 1936 republican platform where they attacked
social security as um a scheme that is unsustainable and as communism what joe rogan is participating
now is just out and out republican propaganda yep it is not new or hip or fresh it doesn't require the world's
greatest mind to figure out unafraid it's not like george bush said this stuff like bob dole said this
stuff like the most banal republican politicians ever have said exactly what elon musk is about to say
the most p-brained people in the world like you know like this is so unexceptional
and the only thing that's amazing about it is that
someone with uh get who gets millions of views on um on youtube or spotify or whatever it is
wouldn't know the least bit about what they're talking about to even attempt to go and find out
so here's elon musk lying about social security now remember they have begun their assault on the
social security administration they have shut down field offices they are firing people this is americans
if i think it's the most beloved government program 60 70 80 percent uh of people are in favor of social
security i think even for expanding it keeps uh two-thirds of our seniors out of poverty two-thirds
of our seniors out of poverty uh it also helps orphans and uh widowers and widows um and uh here is
uh elon musk now remember the the way that they're going to go after social security is first they're
going to try and sever the relationship with americans to it and there's two ways they do it one is they
attack the social security administration make it harder for people to get their checks and two is
to say like it's not in it it's it's it's about to fall apart this is george bush going down to
the bottom of treasury holding up a piece of paper and going like nothing but i'll use here this is
so banal and stupid uh but here it is elon musk the weird one is the pump it dumps like the people
have it all the time all the time yeah and people get shocked that somebody pump it dumped like
what is what are you doing did you like i was hoping to dump i was hoping to make all the money
out of this i can't believe they got me like yeah it's just weird that it's legal still
uh pause it okay they're talking about i think like meme coins right is that what they're talking
about here yeah like trump and it's it is weird that it's legal yeah because it's illegal to do with
stocks and uh to the extent that um uh these crypto guys want to bring this into the fold guys like
gary gensler and other regulators wanted to bring it within a regulatory framework to protect people
from it but the guy sitting across from joe rogan as he says it's weird it's not um it's like literally
staring at the reason why right it's not illegal like all the people that you've hosted on your show
not only could they have told you why it's not illegal now they were the reason for it
donald trump announced their election yes they bought sherrod brown's seat in ohio i mean the crypto boy
he's so very close to knowing the answer but it's so so far away the melania coin was a pump and dump
that was created on january 19th the day before the election and you know who's behind that same coin
the same guys that were behind the javier malay pump and dump um as a part of the uh using his
platform as the the leader of argentina to make a bunch of money for a few wealthy people by announcing
it publicly right so this is the kind of thing that they're trying to copy for the federal government
and then he's claiming like all the it's musk and those guys and andresen etc in fact trump just there
was a pump and dump yesterday that happened when donald trump tweeted out you should buy david sachs's
etf of five uh uh crypto coins
he had david sachs on too didn't he okay good it's just weird that it's illegal yeah it's so weird uh
i mean casinos are legal yeah and it is like just lose money at casinos yeah right but you can't
rig a casino you know what's amazing about that is is that like rogan doesn't realize he's making musk
uncomfortable yeah because musk knows exactly why it's not illegal in fact he just spent hundreds of
millions of dollars to get donald trump elected there were hundreds of millions of dollars spent
by crypto people to make sure that it's not illegal so he talks about casinos actually you know uh there's
regulations in casinos too just go back a little bit it's pretty actually strict of where when you can
build a casino right uh i mean casino's illegal yeah and it is like just lose money at casinos yeah but you
can't rig a casino like a pump and dump you could rig a pump and dump you know uh yeah i guess okay
i'm sorry really quick don't take it down but the house always wins is a phrase about the casino so
okay keep going well yeah but at least you know that you know that going in like you can read what
the odds are we know that craps are you know 49 or whatever it is but what's amazing here is that
like literally it would be like rogan sitting across from this guy keep it up rogan's sitting
across from this guy going like who's making all these teslas yeah and self-driving cars all over
the place musk is just sitting there going like oh how can i change the subject from there's a daytona
five hundred like does like musk is like thinking to himself is is rogan this stupid or is he playing
with me and he's about to find out oh no he's this stupid let me distract you this is like literally
like honestly what you do with like a like a three-year-old child and candy oh look it over there
it's a birdie can you see the birdie birdie good like you could run a real pyramid scheme
i mean the government's one big permit scheme if you ask me yeah well oh change the topic
social security is is the biggest ponzi scheme of all time right explain that oh so um people pay
for social security um and and the money goes out of social security immediately but the obligation for
social security is uh your entire retirement career so you're you're paying uh with your
you're paying like like if you look at the future obligations of social security
it far exceeds uh the the tax revenue raise taxes far have you ever looked at the okay positive right i
need to stop you here because i mean this guy it's unbelievable i don't i stutter i say ah and um
and this guy can't even get out the basic premise of what he's trying to talk about which of course
is also a lie first of all what makes a ponzi scheme a ponzi scheme is that you're pretending to make
investments and instead of actually making investments you're paying out people from the
new investors you're taking in now at one point somebody's going to get wise to this
because if all the people say hey i want my money out now you're in big trouble and that's what
your prerogative that's what happened to madoff that's what happened to sam israel i mean this is
what happens with ponzi schemes social security is not a ponzi scheme because there are very
clear times when you can take your money out you need to be uh with near retirement age your full
retirement age early retirement age or late retirement age and we will never run out of this
this is not an investment it's it's insurance insurance also the same thing right like uh
right is similar dynamic we will never run out of people paying into the system unless
there's some type of like nuclear event and or like space invaders come down and eliminate everybody
because the law is you've got to keep paying into the system until you get to retirement age
and now he's going into well there's all these unfunded uh uh liabilities in other words if all these
people oh you know who are alive today born just in this moment turn 65 it's going to be 67 now for
for anybody born today certainly it's 67 for me um turn 67 we don't have the money to pay them out
now right now in fact the way that the system works we have a slush fund called the trust fund
that was designed in 1983 to deal with the baby boomers and then everybody gets paid out 83 to 85
that's an intermediate assessment right there's a um things could be much better things could be uh
worse that's the middle uh assessment and this is going to end in 2035 that uh trust fund but what
he's describing is even more dire for every other thing in our budget because today is march 3rd on
march 15th you know how much of the defense department is funded zero zero do you know how
much the uh fbi is funded zero the usda zero the epa zero none of it there is no budget for any of it
and that doesn't mean they are ponzi schemes no they are not ponzi schemes we anticipate
that congress at one point the republicans will get their act together and be able to pass a budget
or even just like say we're just going to keep using the old budget from last year until we come
up with a new one social security is in fact the most funded liability that we have associated with
their government whatsoever as of march 17th there are zero dollars budgeted for uh our defense
i mean if everybody believed that that was the case we were running around oh my god we're we're
going to be attacked by uh mexico is going to invade us in canada they've been they've been setting the
the groundwork they've been booing our anthem they're signaling they're going to cross the border
border i mean no one's doing that because of course we know that uh that that congress will budget it
congress has the ability to raise taxes and lower taxes and they could easily raise the tax on social
security it wouldn't affect anybody here's the thing it wouldn't affect anybody making less than
a hundred and seventy six thousand dollars because you are already paying that tax it would only affect
people making more than a hundred and seventy six thousand dollars maybe based upon whose idea
it has it wouldn't affect anybody making less than four hundred thousand dollars and they could just
tomorrow we're just going to create that donut hole or we're just going to blow out the cap
and then all this is just nonsense what he's saying right and then you could essentially not have to
worry about any of that but the it's a part of mandatory spending it's our we already have the
mechanism via the payroll tax to fund all of this so unless he's saying that we're going to just
completely obliterate the way we've been doing taxation under social security for almost a hundred
years or i guess also uh medicare is a part of it as well right then then that would be like the dire
circumstances that he's described but as long as we still have the payroll tax it's going to be
funded you'll still get over 80 percent of your benefits he's creating this kind of anxiety and
republicans have always been doing this because they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthy
this could be solved and we could even increase benefits under social security if we obliterated the
tax the the uh the cap so no cuts for four words no cuts raise taxes right
far have you ever looked at the the debt the debt clock yes okay there's this there's our present
day debt but then there's our future obligations so when you look at the future obligations of social
security um the actual national debt is like double what what people think it is because of the future
obligations so stupid uh so basically people are living way longer than expected okay okay so he's
just shifted now he just shifted dramatically yeah if you have a car payment if anybody listening to me
has a car payment has a mortgage has a credit card bill has even let's say uh you get cable television
or you have a subscription to hulu you have unfunded liabilities in the future
that means that you owe this money
you you have mortgage you owe that money but you say well i have a job on one hand you have all these
liabilities facing you i owe 150 000 on my mortgage oh my god oh my god i owe 150 000 on my mortgage ah but
the good news is i will keep my job and i will pay that mortgage when musk says they're unfunded liabilities
twice the size of the debt clock he is not acknowledging that on the other side is all of
the american workers who will be paying in to the service to the uh right social security system he's
ignoring that because he just got caught trying to uh change the subject from why don't we have
regulations on crypto and and then when he sees that rogan is sitting there going like wait a second
what does that mean it's all this unfunded so go back a little bit you'll see that he then
changes tact and says oh people are living longer you know who else has figured out that people are
living longer the actuarials who work or the actuaries who work at the social security administration
in fact they knew back in 1983 that there was a baby boom and there was going to be more people
retiring and they can look at all the data you don't have to be a magical genius to say people are
living longer and also to be clear people in the top 50 percentile of income distribution are living longer
people in the uh bottom 50 percentile are living barely longer right and notice how though like
they both uh uh he he talks essentially about how uh social security uh it's in trouble and and that's
why we have to do all of this okay here's like the simple reason you can raise taxes oh well no it's
a ponzi scheme then so they're he's both they both insist on how important social security is but also
how we basically how precarious how precarious it is at the same time you could just do the simple
solution if you really cared about it but that's not what he cares about he cares about getting rich
so when you look at the future obligations of social security um the actual national debt is like
double what what people think it is because of the future obligations
uh so basically people are living way longer than expected
people are living way longer than expected excuse me what what it's those 150 what what
we expected when
expected in the 700s like you're telling me that people didn't anticipate people would be living longer
within the whole point of society is that the point of all of society that we've anticipating like
if anything we have underestimated how uh life expectancy hasn't been shared across the board
i mean this is one of the most obvious things in the world if we have better hygiene better medicine
better nutrition life expectancy will continue better medicine to deal with uh things like this is one of
the dumbest things i've ever heard anybody assert who has the ability to show up at a location on time
now maybe he was late to this interview and maybe he needed a driver and he has a handler to do this
but this guy it's unbelievable like you can't even come up with a good fake argument nobody expected
like longevity like people to live longer again our life expectancy fell in our way aside from the fact
that our life expectancy has fallen now i don't know if it's fallen since the age of 65. in other words
you can measure life expectancy at the time of birth which often gets is problematic a lot of times like uh
you know now life expectancy at the time of birth has actually gone down a little bit because
of these abortion bans we're finding that uh more children are born who have no ability to actually
live past a few hours past a few weeks and then we also seeing an uptick in people die in their 20s and 30s
and 40s because of suicide because of violence because of opioids
and if you get to 65 those numbers go up again for people who have not had to work in physical labor
for the most part uh in their life but so everything he's saying is just absolute gobbledygook he like
there's been like to opine on this stuff and to have had zero intellectual curiosity and even with his
horrible agenda to have not done even enough work to tell a good lie about it is just sad go back a little
bit um the actual uh national debt is like double what what people think it is because of the future
obligations uh so we need to pull that basically people are living way longer than expected um and
there are fewer babies being born so you have more people who are retired and get
okay now he's talking about worker to retiree ratio now here's the thing when it started it was like
450 workers to one retiree right now guess why that might be because you just instituted the program
so let's look at 1975 for instance it was like 3.5 workers to every retiree and now it's 2.5
what has happened during that time is the productivity of workers has increased so the output
that they're doing has increased and they've paid more into social security the difference is however
from the 1980s to now is that wealth inequality has expanded so when you have a cap
and you just limit the social security taxes to the first 176 it goes up the first 176 000 that is earned
there are people who are so wealthy that they are hoarding
like measurable percentages of all the wealth that is uh that is earned all the wages that are earned in
this country and they're hoarding that money and that money is no longer touched by the social security
administer uh tax so you know if you had 10 people and they're all making 176 000 dollars
all of their uh all of that money would be taxed but if you have
one person who's making five million dollars and one person who's making 176 in a room or 150 in a room
and the rest are making five thousand dollars all of a sudden only the 176 plus the eight people making
five thousand dollars gets taxed and the guy's got five million his 176 is taxed but then the rest of
the money is is outside of that taxation so as a percentage we used to in this country tax about 91
of the income wages earned in this country were subject to social security tax but now only 86 percent are
that's why we need to blow out the cap but here he is talking about worker to retiree ratio again
such a basic concept that the actuaries at the social security administration have been dealing
with this for years and years and years and years and years well before elon musk was even uh sadly born
uh in apartheid south africa
uh and uh there are fewer babies being born so you have more people who are retired and get that
live for a long time and get retirement payments so the future obligation so however bad the financial
situation is right now for the federal government it will be much worse in the future
with the risk of being a buzzkill here pause it also at the risk of being a buzzkill i know i keep
interrupting but the law in this country is that social security cannot add to the deficit
it cannot add to the deficit or the debt there is not one dollar associated with the operating
deficit of this country the deficit is the uh you know shortfall on a on a yearly basis between what
comes in and what gets expended or the debt which is the loans that we take
to finance that annual deficit not one dollar that is attributed to social security it's the
lock box social security right it's been raided the government has borrowed from social security trust
fund and they don't want to pay it back at least the ones who want to give tax cuts but social security
operates almost in parallel to the rest of the government the wages that are pulled the taxes that are
pulled for social security go to fund social security now again you can raise those taxes
but the the the general fund and social security does not co-mingle so he's lying go ahead
with the risk of being a buzzkill here did you see so we better fix what we've got right now because
if it's bad now it's gonna be much worse in the future there was an interview with this woman who was
a whistleblower yeah did we ever find out if that was true there's so many whistles being blown it's
hard to keep track a lot of whistles this one lady it was only in one state it was very specific and
right but it was using social security money correct that was her don't know that was her allegation
so what what she was alleging was that she was in charge of turning uh illegal immigrants into clients
that's what they would call them and that she would go to them and try to ask them do you have a
headache do you have back problems if you do now you can be permanently disabled you get permanent
disability so you get social security for life yes yeah not just social security but disability
which is even more right and you get them for on the taxpayer dole right away the moment and they're
illegal aliens yes oh uh so if i was to say like what's at the heart of the positive i mean this is
just absurd anybody anybody if you know anybody on disability you you you ask them what the process
was like to get on disability it took them months and months and months and months and months and
documents and documents and documents and uh doctor's visits and testimony i mean it is so difficult
to get on social security disability this is this is uh rogan's you know there are kids with cat litter
who are identifying as cats so they got to put cat litter in the classroom story yeah in fact right now
the dhs is going to the irs and trying to get tax information on people who pay taxes now this is
woefully illegal the irs does not share any of this information in fact part of the reason is just sheer
privacy for everybody but part of it is if you are an undocumented immigrant in this country the irs says
you are still obligated to pay taxes on what you earn they do and on their website they will say to
undocumented immigrants we will not share your information with anybody we want the taxes right
this is the same thing they got al capone on we want your taxes you're going to pay your taxes
we'll and because we're going to fund the gut we want as much tax revenue as we can get
and dhs is going to them to try and get the names of these people who have been paying taxes
now aside from the fact that they suspect these people are undocumented they're just going after um
uh hispanic uh sounding names so there's some uh profiling there they obviously don't know which of
those 700 000 are undocumented some may be some may not be um aside from what it means in terms of
privacy for everybody we want those tax dollars and we will never get them in the future if the irs
gives up this information to dhs because it won't be worth it for these people in the future in fact
a lot of these undocumented immigrants they pay their taxes because they hope someday they can prove
that they have been a benefit to our society they don't get the benefits
but they do get their due they are paying into the system you know how much it is uh there was a
group that analyzed it 25.7 billion dollars in 2022 which was the last uh batch of data that they
were able to look at um social security benefits extracted from people who are undocumented which
essentially means that like of 11 11 million people contributing 25.7 billion dollars in social
security taxes going towards that fund that they will never see most likely if like the trump
administration gets their way and they're not able to become full citizens so good like why is the
democrat propaganda machine so fired up to destroy me that's the main reason just lied about social
security the main reason is that uh is that um uh entitlements fraud that includes like social
security disability medicaid uh entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic
magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here like basically if you if
you pay people uh at a standard of living that is above 90 of earth then you have a very powerful uh
incentive for 90 of earth to come here and to stay here but if you pause it for a second there there is
not i mean it's not poll first of all there's so much stupidity and lies here it's hard to sort of
parse which is which and hypocrisy i mean washington post um reported uh november 1st wapo elon musk worked
illegally in u.s okay i mean uh putting that aside like because it's not about this one bigoted south
african uh former undocumented or he would call illegal imprint um you would never get social security
payments without paying into it never ever you're not in the system how could you possibly
this one story that um uh that uh joe rogan heard that he's not sure is true about this one woman in
some place in america who was actually like seeking out for some reason to give undocumented immigrants
you know doesn't mean you can vote incidentally too it's just like i've just decided to go out willy
nilly didn't risk my job to give money to people who aren't in the system already we also know that
in terms of medicaid and medicare fraud it is the providers not the recipients
all the fraud they found and they find fraud every year because there's investigators although they're
you know getting fired by elon musk is from providers doctors hospitals ambulance companies
medical device makers um the insurance company whoever hey ask rick scott about that exactly
it is like the idea that there is some huge draw to get on social security or medicare medicaid
for undocumented immigrants the idea that they're getting on this without paying into it is just
absurd we have people that like this country does not have a robust social safety net like i don't
know what else i can say to this billionaire who has never wanted for anything in his life even as a
child and now is trying to lecture us about our threadbare social safety net there are many other
countries that immigrants could go to if they wanted say universal health care coverage or something
like that that would provide them with better benefits than we have here but we just said the data
they pay billions and billions of dollars into a system that never pays out for them but apparently
there's an anecdote that rogan may or may have not heard that elon musk says endemic is endemic to
the program go ahead yeah and to stay here but if you if you end the illegal alien fraud then you that you
turn off that magnet and they leave and they stop coming and the ones that are here many of them will
simply leave and if if that happens a massive they will lose a massive number of democratic voters
and if it didn't happen okay i'm sorry apparently immigrants who have undocumented status can vote
the 11 million people are these saying you know they're going to risk uh getting deported to vote
they're also going to risk uh going and saying hey i'm a social security beneficiary even though i don't
have a documented status they're both doing those two things that is just both of those are patently
false and this is one of the biggest podcasts in the country like it's slipping now because he's so
stale and not everybody's into uh billionaire pr hour as their uh podcasts like of choice billionaire
power three hours right but like i mean the fact that he's now had multiple billionaires on on here
to say this kind of crap unchecked this is the kind of thing that we should be regulating like this
should not be allowed to go unchecked there's a corporate responsibility here i'm spotify i'm sorry
but like there's there are repercussions when you say verifiably or there used to be more but there's
uh verifiably false information on television is regulated this is crazy this is now happening over and
over again and it's there to launder just like this in this project that's designed to immiserate
us all and people are buying into it click on this link uh this is the policy dealing with non-citizen
disability claims non-citizen is not an undocumented immigrant it is in fact a documented immigrant
you go down a medical determination not required a medical determination is required those are the
different situations this is a non-citizen filing for ssi disability they have to be uh um have to be
uh age 65 years older um they have to be lawfully residing in the u.s on or prior to 8 22 96.
they have to be at the time of uh application a qualified non-citizen that means they must have a
green card or a visa or whatever it is they must meet an exception condition for a qualified non-citizen
etc etc i mean we don't need to see any more of this the bottom line is is like i don't know if
i mean they will use that idea like here it is here's the proof non-citizen getting this
well there's a visa i went to australia after uh college traveled around i had uh an ear condition i went in
and guess what i saw a doctor multiple times each time it was like 10 and i'm like what's going on
here it was nuts it was nuts you just go in you just pay 10 bucks there's no filling out forms or
any of that stuff yeah it was just crazy i i talked about this before but six years ago i was with
somebody who had to spend the night overnight in a parisian hospital and we were ready to leave at like
10 a.m the next morning waiting for where do we sign a check or something or scan our card and they're
like no you can just go and it was different in spain i think there's a slightly a smaller fee
for a hospital visit but yeah it's civilization where you're not indebted um brutally because you
needed health care i mean it's just shocking how much lies uh get put out there and here's the kicker
these guys are also so just like like like juvenile like i mean if if what we just saw wasn't enough
proof that these people are have like a some type of a mental issue and they're just living in their
uh billionaire bubbles this is um elon musk and joe rogan at the billionaire boot licking uh three hour
exercise she knows me too well i'm so predictable tell me what's in fort knox
what's in dogs oh no no what's in fort knox oh god what's in four dogs you're clearly a genius
i said what is in fort knox you know the gold and all oh right fort knox i thought you were talking
about my dogs for a second there yeah she doesn't want to answer the question this is musk's ai on
his phone right is this grok no she's just a pain in my ass do you think that all the gold is in fort
knox do i think all the gold is in fort knox yes conspiracy theorist yeah yes
honestly like this is like uh when saul has his friend over and they uh talking to siri poop
the fart uh fart well i mean uh yes he is he is a conspiracy theorist it's actually it's his
profession the ai said fuck it's really amazing how old are they it's really amazing how much of uh
