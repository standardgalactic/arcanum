you're watching the context it is time for ai decoded
welcome to ai decoded the whole purpose of this program is to lift the lid on artificial
intelligence to help you understand what it's all about and tonight we are going to go
under the hood none of this modern artificial intelligence would be possible without the highly
specialized chips you will have heard of nvidia which alongside apple and amazon is now one of
the biggest companies in the world you might not have heard of grok they are the upstarts in
the market the challenger that so far has raised close to a billion dollars in private finance to
develop a new and alternative kind of chip to the one nvidia supplies ai chips are essential if we
are to expand ai at scale but just as important are the data centers that power and train them
they are the digital factories of the future they need power and lots of it and saudi arabia is the
world's biggest oil exporter has spotted an opportunity suddenly they are building vast
desert data centers so big they might one day be capable of reaching half the world's population
and this week in riyadh at the ai global summit they signed a deal with grok who will supply the
chips for their advanced ai systems coming up we have an exclusive interview with jonathan ross who is
the ceo of glock who will tell us about that deal that he secured and alongside me here in the studio
the brains of the operation uh priya priya lakarni says that here anyway highly artificially intelligent
ceo of ai education company century tech it gets bigger and better that every week i've noticed
uh right um listen um before we go any further i i want to play a little film for our viewers because
i want them to understand the difference in the ai chips that the big players like nvidia are
manufacturing and this new type that's being developed by grok so have a look this is what a
standard ai chip looks like it's a gpu you'll notice the complex crossing lines this design is
responsible for the drastic rise in value for its producers who made the right bet that gpus could be
the engine for ai now this is what a far from standard ai chip looks like uniform clean and really
really fast like 18 times faster than its competition but is this underdog capable of
taking a bite out of the hot ai chip market computational needs were changing fast as self-driving
artificial intelligence and more were being developed at a rapid pace a new architecture more specifically
specialist chips would be needed to pull that off something tailored deeply for its specific task this
is unlike anything on the market the millisecond you hit enter this thing is giving you the entirety of
its response to further put this speed in perspective grok chips enable llms to write a full book
in about a hundred seconds goodness me um before we talk to jonathan tell me about the the chip ecosystem
what's going on here what's the context of it so the reason why this is really exciting and this new
technology that jonathan his team have developed is really exciting is because there are very few global
players in this ecosystem right so you have what we call foundries which are the big manufacturing
facilities that manufacture the chips right the biggest foundry for the advanced ai trips is in
taiwan it's tsmc right and then and then there are a couple of other foundries as well then you have
what we call fabulous companies the fabulous companies are nvidia amd so they design the chips but
they don't actually manufacture the chips and then you get companies like samsung and intel who essentially
have more of the end-to-end sort of ecosystem right they design the chips and they manufacture them
and as you'll see they also start to provide that that manufacturing facility to other companies as
well but there's very few players the market's absolutely massive but what's interesting christian
is nvidia has about 80 percent let's say of the market right they also do data centers and other
things but they are the dominant player in the market so grok has come in with this technology
they've done this deal in saudi arabia with aramco and they are i'm sure jonathan's going to tell us
vying for some of that market share and what's going to be really interesting is you know what's
his designer and manufacturer he's well he'll tell you they're the designers so and actually they've
picked samsung and he'll correct me if i'm wrong but samsung as their manufacturer which i do think
is really interesting you know why did they choose samsung and what was the reason in the decision-making
process was there a geopolitical reason as to why they didn't pick a taiwanese company tsmc and we'll
talk about the geopolitics of this later because it's really complex and truly fascinating as well
at the same time but that's the ecosystem but there's huge and huge amounts of money and investment
here startups can't just go and build a factory it costs billions and billions of dollars tsmc have just
opened the factory they started a factory in arizona they haven't finished completed it because it costs
an enormous amount of money and they're seeing some issues while they're trying to build that
so it's going to be really interesting to hear from jonathan you know what's his strategy and
how's he actually going to try and muscle in on some of that nvidia market share well let's bring
him in jonathan ross ceo of grok welcome to the program i should say congratulations because you've
just signed this immense deal with uh aramco tell us what it is so we've signed a deal to deploy uh
starting this year 20 000 of our chips in uh the kingdom and um next year we have an mou to deploy
up to 200 000 and harrison that uh nvidia deployed about 500 000 there and gpus last year now of course
this year they've increased it to two million but that still makes us a pretty sizable player
right um i'm i'm guessing that the new chips are not in this communication that we have because
your picture is frozen but we'll press on because we can hear you very well
um what is what is your unique selling point of this chip over the others
speed so uh the biggest selling point is uh you remember dial-up when you used to have to wait a
very long time for your answer to arrive and you would see it show up very slowly uh with this chip
you get an answer that's almost instant it's almost like broadband and it changes the experience and it
makes it much more engaging and jonathan what's your strategy to carve out a share in this space
because you've got nvidia that's going to come out with a blackwell platform hopefully in q4 of this year
and they're claiming claiming 25 times less cost it's more energy efficient and it's a lot faster
well the amazing thing is we built this chip on what's considered fairly old technology 14 nanometer
and you measure it in the size of the things that are on the chip the transistors and the components
and nvidia's latest chips are four nanometer and yet we're actually still faster now you mentioned
the samsung fab that we're going to be building our next generation chip with we're actually going to
be going to four nanometer as well and it's sort of like we get to skip three grades in terms of our
capabilities when we do that so we're already the world's fastest the other thing is we're much less
expensive a modern day gpu has expensive they also have a lot of other very complex and expensive
parts that go in there that they use to connect up that memory and we don't have any of that but also
because we're using an older process 14 nanometer for our current generation and even by the time our
v2 comes around with a four nanometer it's going to be pretty widely available technology it's going to be
underutilized whereas right now everyone's trying to use the latest process and so it's really hard
to ramp up the supply so just for someone who's not deeply involved in this world as you and priya are
priya was explaining to me that you are the these chips are going to be looking primarily at text
but but how might they be used in industry in the future i mean as we move to facial recognition
technology or to driving robot technology how do you think your your second and third versions of
this chip might develop actually our current chip um we just launched a what's called multimodal model
last week where it takes both text and images in and it outputs text about the image so for example you
could upload this image and ask um you know how many lights are in the image or how many lamps and
will answer that this is very useful for commerce for example you could upload the image of a product
and create a description for it and so that's what some customers of ours are going to be using it for
we also do speech to text so we're very general really what's different about our chip versus gpus in terms
of what you can use it for is that it's used for something called inference as opposed to training
and the difference between those two when it comes to ai if you want to become a heart surgeon
you spend many years training and what gpus are really good at is training the models what we're
really good at is inference which is sort of the heart surgeon doing actual heart surgeries the practice
and you spend a lot of money on the training but you make your money on the inference
it's also much more cost sensitive because every single time you use one of these ai's whether
it's a chatbot or whether it's something else you actually are consuming compute and so where we operate
if you want to think about ai in terms of the way the industrial revolution happened or transportation
you can think of the model as the car but it has to run on oil or petrol and what we're providing is
the compute which is the new oil you can have the best ai model in the world but if you don't have
enough compute you can't run it and one of the astounding things is um in about the last uh couple
of months about four or five months uh we've gone from fewer than 10 developers to as of today we hit
450 000 developers on our platform it took nvidia about uh seven years to get to a hundred thousand we got
there in six weeks and a large part of that is because what nvidia did they created some amazing models that
people want to use but because we run them so much faster and because most of the applications are
built to use the ai there's been incredible demand and so the reason that we're here in saudi arabia
is because we need to build out a lot more work compute and they have the financial resources and
they have the energy and jonathan a question about being in saudi arabia and this this deal this mou i
you i suppose the momentum of understanding that you've got in saudi arabia with um aramco it's
intriguing because i know that the us obviously wants its companies to have a huge addressable
market they want you to do business outside of the us with lots of countries they want those countries
to be cozying up to certainly the us rather than china when it comes to building their ai capabilities
but you know i'm looking at a parallel example of when microsoft invested in g42 the uae company
and washington was very clear that they needed to stop working with huawei g42 and they needed to
sell the stock invested in their company that was invested by chinese investors and so you've now done
this got this mou with aramco we know that in saudi arabia that they're quite close to the chinese you
know they've had um deals between uh the piff the saudi public investment funds um you know it has has an
interest in lenovo you've had an investment from aramco's prosperity seven in an llm uh in in china
so has i mean have u.s officials been in touch with you do you expect them to be in touch with you
and aramco you know what do you think about this tension that now exists potentially with this deal
that you struck so uh we've been in contact with the commerce department since before this deal
happened um and uh just to be clear we actually are beyond the mou stage so the project is now budgeted
for the initial 20 000 uh chips um the mous for the remaining uh 200 000 or chinese companies well
in advance of the change in posture from the u.s government a big part of the reason why was it was
very difficult for tech companies to be successful in china um i happened to start the google tpu which
is the chip that google uses for ai and while i was there i saw that um google meta and many other
companies that were very strong companies had a lot of trouble operating in china um what would happen
is as you started to become more successful um things for example if you were if you were doing search
your search engine would get slow um and people wouldn't know why it was the great firewall would just
be slowed down and it was very hard to compete not for competitive reasons but um because the
government really didn't want you to win and we as a small startup didn't feel that we were going to
be in a position to compete in china so we voluntarily decided not to for purely commercial reasons yeah
maybe that's part of why um we can do this deal we're we're very on side jonathan we'll have to
leave it there uh we're up against a break but uh thank you very much for coming on and explaining
it all to us best of luck with uh the deal that you signed out there we'll talk about the geopolitics
of all this after the break we're going to speak to gregory allen who used to work in the joint ai
center at the u.s department of defense you're watching ai decoded welcome back during the cold
war the united states would only supply supercomputers to the soviet union if they were used for weather
forecasting and not nuclear simulation and there were permanent foreign monitors deployed to russia
all data was open for analysis by u.s intelligence like those supercomputers the ai models of the future
have both civilian and military implications so what is of the subject to the same controls we've
just been talking about that there is a blanket ban on selling restricted chips to china what does
washington think about all this uh let's get into it with gregory allen he's a director of the wadwani
center for ai and advanced technologies at the center for strategic and international studies he was
formerly with the u.s department of defense so you'll have heard that last conversation uh most of it we
got um about whether you know if you're doing a deal with the saudis there's a back door to the chinese
how will the u.s government see a deal like that well i think the first thing to begin understanding
is that leaders in the united states leaders in saudi arabia leaders in china all agree that
leadership and artificial intelligence technology is foundational to the future of military and
economic power they are all thinking about how they can increase the competitiveness of their economy
and especially in the case of the united states and china thinking about how they can gain an edge
over one another for the united states which has the most advanced chip designing companies
like nvidia like grok based in its homeland they are seeking to deny china access to the most advanced
chips that can be used to train the most advanced ai models there has been reviews of chinese military
procurement documents and they are looking for american gpu technology and that can be used
to train hypersonic missiles and run simulations of how they can deliver nuclear weapons or can be
used for more commercial applications such as large language models like chat gpt which are used by
hundreds of millions of people around the world the point is is that this is a dual use technology
and the united states government reviews exports of chips such as grok's around the world under those
terms right gregory and there's reports of um some of those chips being smuggled into china right um and
we also had an arrest recently of a samsung an ex-samsung executive yes uh understandably china wants
access to these chips whether or not it's legal to get access to these chips and so china chinese companies
are now engaging smuggling networks to acquire illegally what they can't get legally now that's true of the
chip hardware it is also true of the critical expertise around the semiconductor industry more
broadly and ai specifically in the case of samsung these are two former executives accused and at
at real risk of conviction of transferring critical know-how in advanced semiconductor manufacturing
techniques to chinese companies in violation of intellectual property laws and also economic security
laws in south korea it feels like a nuclear arms race yeah well you know nuclear technology is very
explicitly uh weapons focused really you have nuclear technology in the energy domain and the weapons
domain and a handful of niche medical cases but it really is first and foremost a military technology
artificial intelligence is much closer to computing in general which is you know it's very useful for
running your microsoft word application but it's also useful for running you know military supercomputers
for code breaking that's the challenge here i think the reason why why i'd agree with christian that
it feels like that is because many years ago nuclear power and you know the ability um to have nuclear
capabilities really was a way of asserting your dominance on the global stage right and it seems that although
that's obviously still the case now ai is very very much you know the other area where they're focused on national
security and and cyber security gregory and before we finish with you i do want to ask you because china
is at the center of this so you know what in your view is the role of tsmc which we just talked about earlier
being you know the lead provider of these advanced uh gpus they work with nvidia they work with amd
amongst many other customers of theirs what's their role in terms of china's strategy about whether or
not there is a future invasion of taiwan well you've heard previously in the earlier conversation
that nvidia has very very high market share north of 80 percent for the ai chips that are used to train
these ai models but where are those chips made they're made in taiwan and taiwan's market share for
logic chips at the most advanced manufacturing nodes is essentially 100 percent it's the sole
country on earth that can operate the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes
and that is a critical dependence not just of nvidia but of the entire global economy so china of course
stating that taiwan is rightfully their territory and stating repeatedly their willingness to use military
force if necessary to retake taiwan that is an incredible hinge point of global security and the
global economy if a war was to devastate taiwan's semiconductor industry which i think is a very real
possibility in such a conflict scenario that would be a global economic catastrophe and no one would be
spared from the consequences of that they say estimated about one trillion um you know global economy
damage per year per year yeah fascinating isn't it we talk about what ai can do we never talk about
actually the chips and what is going on around the world to get the best chips uh and to to smuggle
them into countries like china it's extraordinary stuff jonathan thank you very much indeed that is it
for ai decoded this week thanks to jonathan thanks also to gregory and of course to priya for her
expertise as ever we will do this same time next week just a reminder that all the episodes that we've done
so far are on the ai decoded playlist on youtube i will see you next week thanks for watching
