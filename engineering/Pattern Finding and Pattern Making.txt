the first speaker is a
uh somebody that i met first about 12 years ago or so when i was reviewing his book on mind shaping
and he was kind enough to invite me to to washington to have dinner and drinks while
he explained his book to me and we discussed uh discussed it over a very nice meal and had a good
evening and um so now 10 15 years later i'm honored to introduce tad who's a professor
associate professor of philosophy at george washington university
and who will give us a presentation entitled pattern finding and pattern making
oh thank you so much john can everyone hear me i can okay hopefully hopefully your representative
uh so um thanks so much for um inviting me to this and uh again and your flexibility and
accommodating my schedule i have a chair's council meeting to go to later again apologies i'll have
to duck out early um so what i want to talk about today uh i don't think i actually explicitly referred
to normativity or mind shaping in this presentation but i think it's highly relevant as you'll see so
here's the background and the plan i think what the way i'm thinking about this uh project is as an
initial stab at a cognitive neuroscience of ideology and to get clear on what i mean by that uh there'll
be a bit of a whirlwind tour through intellectual history so please bear with me um so the idea
the sort of problematic i want to intervene on is this traditional idea that the cognitive processes
driving what i call pattern finding and pattern making are radically disjoint it corresponds roughly
to distinction between beliefs on the one hand that have a pattern finding function and desires or
intentions that have a pattern making function roughly modeled on the distinction between assertions
and commands in language um and uh i what i want to call the problem of ideology uh roughly is this
some of our most important pattern making relies essentially on beliefs and assertions that
seem to aim at pattern finding and then go on to make themselves at least partially true
um so on this traditional distinction in cognition it's kind of hard to categorize ideology ideology and
ideological thought um in terms of these two different cognitive processes however there is a
recent uh recent sort of very interesting and exciting new approach to cognitive neuroscience uh
called uh you know variably the bayesian brain approach or the predictive processing approach or the
active inference approach and i think it's ideally suited to um accommodating ideological thought
and language so i'm going to the first part of the talk or the lion's share of the talk i'm going to
you know work through this and then at the end i want to say something about how um the uh active
inference approach to explaining individual behavior can be extended to uh the making of social patterns not just
individual patterns and behavior so that's roughly the agenda um let's begin
this is roughly what i mean by found patterns that paradigmatically the patterns uh in nature that are uncovered by
natural science um uh patterns that we notice uh when we um look at evidence the evidence of the senses and try to
um uncover deep regularities that explain them um and what i mean by made patterns or pattern making uh
you know paradigmatically is human artifacts technology practices like dance and marching uh one of the
earliest made patterns known to archaeology is the um aculean hand axe there on the top left corner
architecture um architecture music in language are um paradigmatic examples of made patterns so this
distinction for a very long time in the european tradition at least has been explained in terms of a
distinction in cognition um aristotle distinguishes between three types of knowledge theoria praxis poesis um
theoria aims aims at uh pattern finding uh praxis pattern making in human uh social behavior and poesis pattern
making in technology and even identifies or a different form of thought uh behind these different kinds of
uh practice uh theoretical with famously the theoretical versus the practical syllogism and this duality has had a
huge um influence in the european philosophical tradition most notably people who made it explicit in the
20th century uh very nice um kind of uh encapsulation of the distinction in uh elizabeth anscombe's uh
grocery list example you can have the same list of uh food um in in one case it's playing a uh directive
or pattern making role in the case of the person who's searching for food based on the list but if
you're a private detective uh tailing the person and trying to note what they're buying that's um a
pattern finding role and uh searle famously worked this up into a distinction among uh declarative and
imperative speech acts um where that you can have a speech two speech acts with the same content uh one with
declarative force aiming at tracking a pattern or finding a pattern one with imperative force aimed at
making a pattern okay so that's um the background and uh it's sort of standard cognitive science and
philosophy of mind since hume has maintained this distinction in philosophy of language and sort of
use it as a model of how the mind works so this distinction between belief modules and desire modules
in classic computational uh models of the mind sort of encapsulates the idea of there being a separate
part of cognition devoted to pattern finding another devoted to pattern making and only in collaboration
do they lead to behavior however uh as my dissertation director from many years ago andy clark has recently
argued this model is not an accurate model of how the brain works according to the uh active inference
or predictive processing framework quote desires and motivations are fluently accommodated uh within
the unifying pp schema where they emerge as webs of prior beliefs that sculpt probabilistic predictions
some of which become positioned so as to bring about actions importantly and here's the key idea a single
construct plays the role of belief and desire so that's a nice summary of the active inference
framework which uh makes clear how it differs from this classical uh view according to which the cognitive
processes underlying pattern making and pattern finding are disjoint okay so now on to the problem of
ideology um i you know i'm not an expert in this extremely rich and um um field of philosophical um inquiry
uh so i just want uh for the purpose of this talk to uh propose a sort of minimal um minimal uh understanding
of what ideology is and that is it's pattern making masquerading as pattern finding so in classic discussions
from these uh folks that you see whose pictures you see i i use the term suspicious minds from uh bob brandon i
think at some point uh called this these philosophers uh the philosophers of suspicion um so uh the basic idea
that you you can promote the powerful interest by concealing true patterns with something like masking
patterns that victims unwittingly work to reproduce at least partially so if you think of religion as an
ideology you can think of these uh assertions about the nature of reality the meek shall inherit the earth
god will redeem our suffering as um motivating behavior uh on the part of people who believe them uh that
partially sort of confirms uh these um predictions or um you know as foucault pointed out this uh these
sorts of assumptions about what's natural to human beings it's natural for men to desire women for example
uh masquerading as a found pattern about human beings um that partially uh maintains itself uh in in
virtue of being you know widely promulgated um okay so this has had in contemporary philosophy this basic
idea has had some really rich development by sally for example so sally uh famously argues that a lot of
politically fraught categories of politically fraught categories like race and gender are real but not
natural they're constructed and what's interesting is um sally emphasizes that quote sex and race
oppression are structural institutional but they're also internalized in our basic interpretations
and understandings of our bodies ourselves and each other um and that's sort of what i'm trying to get at here is
is in what does this internalization consist what how what model of neural computation might be able to
account for this uh one reason um that these sorts of patterns are incredibly uh persistent um has been
explored in the work of caylyn o'connor where she deploys um evolutionary game theory to explain why certain
sort of ideological patterns uh become stable um because they uh uh constitute or contribute to what
she calls complementary uh solutions to complementary coordination problems uh uh as opposed to correlative
ones so correlative one driving on the right everyone does the same thing um and in a complementary
coordination problem you have people playing different roles to solve the coordination problem as in um
dances like the paso doble um so she applies this to uh gender norms and looks for example at gendered
solutions to household division of labor problems um and argues that if you model these using evolutionary
game theoretic simulations it shows that asymmetric role solutions can be stable equilibrium strategies what
that means roughly is that not playing the disadvantaged role has greater costs uh than playing it um so for
example uh the persistent asymmetry in um the female uh uh uh bird part of the burden in in domestic and the
household division of labor problem is uh it it persists because not doing it is actually makes the person
worse off in in these game theoretic uh dynamics so o'connor argues that this explains why these gender
asymmetries um uh are stable and remarkably robust across cultures unfortunately um but also she shows that
she argues in this book that um they're not inevitable right uh there is cultural variation so
socio-historical and political factors explain the particular um uh distributions that we see in
particular cultures okay um another sort of uh uh um famous concept from recent philosophy which
uh is sort of in this vicinity and gestures towards a cognitive explanation of this sort of phenomenon
is uh hacking's notion another another person who um uh sadly departed uh um our our world uh this past year
uh um the notion of a looping effect so he famously argues that humankind's and in particular psychiatric
uh classifications sort of are engaged in this kind of looping effect where the labeling um has dynamic
effects thus dynamic nominalism has dynamic effects uh on the uh people who are uh labeled and he thinks
this marks an important distinction because unlike natural objects humans are aware that and how they're
categorized um unlike say um a sample of iron which gets categorized but is not aware of it uh human beings
are aware um and the categorization feeds back effect in the categorized and that triggers tweaks to the
the initial categorization and you get this kind of spiral uh this dynamic spiral and um you know he
talks about different illustrations of this of how you know the category of multiple personality gets taken
up by people diagnosed in its terms and gets turned into a new category dissociative identity similar for these other
um concepts um and finally there's some very interesting empirical evidence that shows
um how uh uh descriptive norms can have these sorts of looping or self-fulfilling effects
so public social scientific classifications this is a recent paper by uva peters who shows uh discusses
all the evidence that i mean it's relevant to uh science communication that's what this
uh papers about uh the way descriptive norms are communicated the public often leads to um their
own fulfillment so a descriptive norm is something that aims to capture to track a pattern in the
world or find a pattern in the world but it ends up making patterns or reinforcing these patterns so
for example californian households informed that they use more electricity than all the other
households in their neighborhood subsequently reduced their energy consumption whereas households
informed that they use less than all others increased it so there's an interesting duality
here that's similar to what i think i claim to be uh um definitive of ideology where something which
appears to be describing a pattern actually works kind of unconsciously to reinforce the pattern
uh um and make it more stable okay so how helpful how have philosophers is there a sort of any
philosophical discussion of this something that really uh stands out is millican's concept of a push me
pull you representation uh from way back in the 90s uh millican argued that this is actually the
primitive form of representation that um non-human species uh all share and that actually distinguishing
between pattern finding and pattern making uh cognitive states beliefs and desires as a sort of
later arriving um uh things so so she sort of anticipates this this kind of um uh approach that
active inference uh takes now um so as she writes what one does what a woman does what a teacher does how
one behaves when one is married or when one is chair of the meeting these are grasped via thoughts
push me pull you representations that simultaneously describe and prescribe um we don't eat peas with
our fingers is another example where you know the the the grammatical surface grammar appears to be
an assertive uh pattern finding uh uh act but of course it has this normative dimension uh implied
when especially when a parent says this to a child you see this all over in politics uh you know
over two years ago now uh uh secretary blinken used this assertion when all is said and done
in independent ukraine will be there and at some point vladimir putin will not but um of course he
had very little evidence for that when he uttered it um it was more uh sort of aspirational and in
politics often you will hear assertions or predictions made which clearly are also functioning to try and
make themselves true or contribute at least to their uh self-confirmation so um that's a sort of classic
push me pull you representation um okay so now on to this new paradigm a little detail about predictive
processing and active inference this is the basic bayesian algorithm that's uh the the kind of building block of the active
inference paradigm i'm not going to go into the details of the math because i frankly am a little
foggy on it myself but um i think the bullet point here encapsulates the basic idea that the brain really
has one um uh imperative which is to minimize the difference between old information which is stored
in its models of the world which generate expectations and new information which is uh sensory stimulation
and um active inference is the idea that there are two ways that the brain can succeed at this here's a
this here's a recent discussion uh um by a par petsulo and fristan uh fristan being the sort of uh
pioneer of this approach under active inference perception and action are two complementary ways
to fulfill the same imperative minimization of free energy um what he means by free energy is
something like surprise so perception minimizes free energy by bayesian belief updating or
changing your mind thus making your beliefs compatible with sensory observation instead action minimizes
free energy and surprise by changing the world to make it more compatible with your beliefs and goals
this unification of cognitive functions marks a fundamental difference between active inference and
other approaches that treat action and perception in isolation from one another so here's a diagram from
that book which makes this very clear you make a prediction about how the world will be there's an
observation there's a discrepancy between the two and then there are two options to minimize this
discrepancy which is what the brain aims for you can either change the model which yielded the prediction
so that next time it conforms more closely to the observation or you can change the world uh this is what
happens in action where the world the relevant part of the world is your body um and uh so that the
action more closely uh next time um accommodate uh uh matches the prediction okay um another discussion of
this from jacob howey one of the earliest philosophical discussions of the active inference uh paradigm um i'm in the
interest of time i won't read the long quote but this is sort of a standard assumption in this new
approach to relatively new approach to uh cognitive neuroscience so uh the lesson i want to glean from
this is that the basic idea in active inference is uh when it comes to explaining pattern making or action
is something i want to say call counterfactual expectation perseveration what i mean by this is
is um the idea is instead of maximizing utility relative to some extrinsic goal uh agents minimize
prediction error by acting to minimize the difference between proprioceptive feedback and expectations so
that's the model of action right so the idea is you when you raise your arm you predict that it's a high
up before it's high up and there's a discrepancy between your prediction and the feedback you're
getting from your arm but somehow the discrepancy is minimized not by changing the representation of the
position of your arm but rather by adjusting your arm such that it meets the prediction and so this raises
the question why not just adjust the expectation right um and just say you know my arm is down not up and just change
your assumption about where your arm is as you do uh to in most cases of discrepancy and the answer here
is that some expectations especially those related to fundamental requirements on survival are what we
might term sticky uh they don't go away even when there's a discrepancy and the only way to minimize the
discrepancy is to act right so a classic example from this literature is the representation of your internal
body temperature when um the feedback from your body departs from this uh say uh your temperatures
go higher your uh you don't adjust the um expectation about the temperature your your body should be rather
there are activities that take place to uh try to bring your body temperature um back down to that uh
predicted temperature so what makes uh some expectations sticky excuse me here's how uh andy
clark puts it bringing about an action requires attenuating which means assigning a low precision
to the sensory information currently indexing the actual disposition of the body so as to enable
precise proprioceptive predictions corresponding to some desired trajectory to prevail intentional action
thus depends upon a delicate balance that combines precise proprioceptive predictions with attenuated
information concerning current bodily states and here's what's interesting i think for the problem of
ideology an interesting consequence is that action thus depends on a kind of systematic misrepresentation
of how our body is currently arrayed in space okay so here's the lesson i want to draw from all this
here's the classic pattern finding pattern making disjunction uh that um i mentioned earlier some
thoughts or or uh speech acts have a what searle calls a word to world direction of fit so for example diet
diet doesn't impact health humans act rationally that maps onto true or false right where where the um
word is trying to respect constraints placed on it by the world but other assertions uh or sort of other
speech acts or thoughts have the opposite direction of fit a world to word direction of fit where the world
is modified to um uh fit the word so men and women act thus for example or life has meaning and every thought
and every discursive act has to be placed in one of these two buckets on the classic view and you know the the
what's motivating my talk is that ideology is a bit hard it's a bit hard to know which bucket to put it
in because it sort of presents as a pattern uh finding act but it actually functions as a pattern
making act and what's cool about active inference is it enables us to replace this classic um distinction
this classic picture with the following one where you have a kind of um continuum of pattern finding and
pattern making um where and there are dimensions on which you can place any uh linguistic act or or any
thought um on along the horizontal x axis you can think of that as a measure of stickiness to what extent
does the expectation um is the expectation preserved despite a discrepancy from sensory feedback
and on the vertical axis you have say uh rather than truth or falsity um or fulfillment and or
unfulfillment you have this generic notion of prediction error so here you might say well diet
doesn't impact health that's a huge prediction error um uh and it's also not that sticky we're very
willing to revise that um humans act rationally is a little more it's a little stickier it's a pretty
good descript description of human beings but uh it's not a perfect description but it despite the
fact that it sometimes fails to describe adequately human behavior we hold on to it uh and it ends up
regulating human behavior to some uh a degree men and women act thus this is sort of getting towards
the more ideological part of the spectrum uh where um you know the prediction error is relatively high
and yet it's still very sticky um and then you know here's my attempt at humor uh my nihilistic
attempt at humor where um uh something that like life has meaning it could be have a lot of prediction
error and yet we can't get rid of it it's very sticky okay so that's uh that's the idea that's why i
i think the active inference um approach is a nice fit with ideology because it's not like there are these
two buckets where a thought or a judgment has to fall as either making patterns or finding patterns
it falls somewhere upon this continuum uh defined in terms of these two dimensions and the interesting
thing is that you know for different people the same judgment might fall in different parts um of this
spectrum so i i think this is a much better fit uh because when it comes to ideology there's you know
variations in uh how sticky the assumptions are and how much prediction error they generate okay so
that's uh now the problem here is that the active inference approach is a model of individual behavior
how does this translate into pattern making at the social level which is you know how where ideology is
usually uh found and um there are some uh possible mechanisms where of this so one idea is the
notion of identification so often um by identifying with a group you can look at the brazilian
soccer fans on the picture there is an example that by identifying with a group or with another person
one's own sort of uh active inferential uh um judgments are transferred onto another person i
it's a nice example for when my child my son anton was very young we went up on this water slide up on
this rickety rickety um staircase into this platform to go down this water slide and i have terrible um
terrible vertigo i was terrified uh he didn't care he was completely oblivious but as he sort of
approached the edge i couldn't help but um uh feel like like uh you know danger was imminent and i felt it
in my body presumably because i was identifying uh with him to such a embodied extent that um uh i had this
sort of active uh desire to stop him uh another example is you know strawson's notion of reactive
attitudes where we see someone um violating normative expectation and instead of adjusting our
expectations such they that they better track their behavior in the future we have these react emotional
responses like resentment blame and so forth to try and you know modify the pattern to fit the expectation
or there might be more basic mechanisms such as those involved in dance and marching where there's
this basic motor resonance or behavioral synchrony among multiple people i think all of these mechanisms
suggest a kind of social have a sort of social niche construction um function a concept from uh evo devo
approaches in uh evolutionary biology where sometimes the adaptive uh um the adaptive uh response is not to
modify oneself to uh respect a uh environment but rather to modify the environment to make it a better fit
with one's own expectations and i think humans do a lot of that a kind of social niche construction so i
want to locate ideology in this kind of um zone think of them as socio-cognitive tools which shape us into better
socio-cognitive objects and agents um there are some nascent um proposals along these lines uh one by my
current postdoc remy tisson who i think is in the audience uh has a recent uh uh piece um in philosophical
psychology where he links the active inference framework to mind shaping um uh in roughly the way
suggested here also a recent um uh target article in uh um uh i think it's uh life uh physics of life
reviews uh by terrio young and barrett which talks uses the active inference framework to try and explain
the sense of should so i think there is some interesting work just beginning um along these lines
okay so to conclude i want to make a few remarks about what the implications of this picture are for
human social cognition and folk psychology here's a a relevant digression just quickly there's a bit
of a dispute within the active inference uh literature about what these models uh that the brain uh develops
what they're tracking so uh howie originally argues that predictive processing and bayesian updating
inevitably lead to increasingly accurate models of the causal structure the hidden causal structure
of the world which is responsible for the sensory stimulations um that yield error signals but
andy clark instead argues that really all the brain cares about a successful action and so what
the models need to track are affordances not necessarily the uh causal structure the hidden causal
structure of the world affordances is a gibsonian notion you could see a classic gibsonian picture
of a bird in flight up on the on the right where the bird is simply tracking this kind of relational
or a constructed property uh that relates it to its environment in a sort of dynamic way and enables to
enables it to guide its behavior adaptively that's not an objective fact about the causal structure of
the world it's a relational uh property that uh relates the organism to um uh some features in the
environment and so transposing this onto uh the case of social cognition for us ultra social humans
if we take andy clark's approach what are the social affordances that our models of the social world
uh enable us to track before gesturing towards an answer um i want to put on the table two challenges
for applying uh active inference or predictive processing to social cognition one problem is by
predictive processing's own lights the folk psychology that predict predictive processing generates our folk
psychology when applied to the social domain is not an accurate model of the relevant causal structures
what do i mean by this well the folk aren't bayesians the folk don't think of perception as top-down
bayesian inference inference of departures from expected sensory stimulations they don't think of
perception in action as aiming at the same goal they don't think of expectations as distributions of
credences and so forth so that means you know by by predictive processing own lights that when applied to the
social domain predictive processing does not yield an accurate model of the relevant causal structures
rather it yields folk psychology um so here at least howie's view seems obviously false and clark's view
seems more applicable we're tracking social affordances but then that raises this question why does do human
coordination problems afford folk psychological controls um and the second question is you know the
big problem in uh coordination has been recognized by game theorists philosophers for a long time is that
we're trying to predict agents who are also trying to predict us at the same time so when we apply our sort of
predictive models we have to take into account that um the the process is somehow also modeling us and that
seems to threaten this kind of unstable regress so what i want to suggest is that there's a solution to both of these problems if we think of
folk psychology as something i've called um in print a socio-cognitive tool that the idea is that the folk
psychology generated by predictive processing and applied to social domain is not a model of the
causal structure of individual mind brains rather it's a set of socio-cognitive tools that shapes us
into better socio-cognitive agents and objects we work to turn each other into better believers desirers
willers because this makes us easier to interpret and predict by others doing the same so um these
are the social affordances tracked by predictive processing applied to the social domain they're
patterns we find in the social domain because they're also patterns we make uh another way to a slogan to
think of this by is ideologies are these coordination devices um okay so one uh way we could extend this
line of thought is so whence uh are these folk psychological distinctions like the one we began with
that don't map onto anything in the brain if you buy the active inference paradigm um for example
why did folk psychology encode a distinction between belief and desire well here's how uh here's a sort
of sketch of an explanation in an ultra social species like ours that relies on information sharing
distinguishing between essentially epistemic and pragmatic states is extremely useful
uh the variation in uses to which human brains put information is is widespread so communicating the
precise idiosyncratic functional profile some information plays in one brain to another is
unlikely to be useful and very likely to be impossible given how fine-grained the nuances in these functions
are if we buy active inference so we can learn from others only if we can abstract information likely to be
useful for us from the detailed idiosyncratic uses to which only uh to which only particular others put it
and distinguishing between purely epistemic and pragmatic dimensions of nearly implemented expectations
makes this possible so this shows how this distinction uh between belief and desire though not sort of
fundamental to how the brain works can somehow uh shape the way brains come to work uh once there's a
distinction in language between assertion and command and it it shows why making this distinction could be
very useful because it sort of extracts shareable content from uh um this sort of uh uh um uh task
committed content uh that that individual brains uh have um in any case that's just a sketch uh in which uh
i hope someday perhaps to take this basic picture um so i guess we can end on this when i first gave this
talk in cork ireland as i was walking to the venue i see this massive poster and i thought this really
encapsulates the view that you know belief is kind of something we do and we can do it uh more or less
such a sketch about this effectively um so thank you very much
