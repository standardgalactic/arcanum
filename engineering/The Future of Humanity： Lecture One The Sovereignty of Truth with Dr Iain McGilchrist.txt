well thank you very much thank you for those words of introduction and thank you for your
welcoming applause and I'm very aware that we are facing a real crisis and I feel my my fragility my
weakness really in in having anything useful to say about this put together some thoughts about the
importance of truth and I'll try and convey as much as I can in the time that I have in a way this
is my il pensoroso and the other lecture will be l'allegro because in this one I'm putting forward
the shadow side and in the other I'm hoping to put forward a much more hopeful side so don't cut
your throats before you've heard the after lunch talk okay I read yesterday that almost a third of
young French people have lost faith in democracy according to a poll why I think the roots go deep
and we're no longer remotely what we were born to be
Emerson as it happens we didn't confer said in his 1836 book nature very very profound and interesting
book man is a dwarf of himself what did he mean by that what he meant was that we are destined to
we have the potential to achieve a really important role in the cosmos not just for ourselves but for the
existence of what is good beautiful and true and in my lifetime I've seen each of these important
transcendental values sidelined decried debased destroyed why is the life at all well I'm not going to say
much about this now I'll say something more about it in the second talk I gave today but effectively
I do think that our role the reason there is life and the reason there are human beings is to reflect
and to magnify the elements of goodness beauty and truth in the cosmos and now of course there is an attack
on all three and I mainly going to be talking about truth for now I think the sheer trashiness of our
culture is killing us it is distracting us from everything that is important and every time somebody
tries to raise a question that is really important it is dismissed ironized or becomes the object of some
kind of political target you and it's not just that we're distracted from truth but we demand protection
from truth in case it hurts us in case life hurts us we'll grow up and live because life is tough
everybody's life is tough life is a challenge a challenge we should rise to we are resilient we have in us
resilience and yet we're all the time being encouraged to think about what we believe might have determined
us in the past and so we're traumatized and of no use but instead I think we should think of what we will
allow ourselves to be drawn towards in the future which is all we have to mold our own and that of humanity
we live in a lying culture in so many ways in government in the universities alas and across a whole range of public debate
mediated by social media of course at its worst but even by the once trustable sources of integrity which seem to have
become partisan I was very struck by a book I read in 1978 when it was first published called lying and it's by
Cecil a Cecil a walk a philosopher and she talks about lying in and deception of all kinds in public and private life
across government medicine law academia journalism in the family and between friends and she rather
controversially argues that there are no situations and I think she's wrong about this but there are no
situations in which a lie can be excused I think a better way of putting it is that the price of lying is enormously high and
that only the most extreme circumstances make a lie justifiable we can't live by lies and this is the book
simply entitled lying and it's still in print but actually eight years before I had heard what David was
referred to Solzhenitsyn's Nobel Prize acceptance speech he was a man who had been tortured imprisoned
subjected to inhuman circumstances and wasn't allowed to go and receive his Nobel Prize but his lecture was read for him
and I remember hearing it through the radio in the kitchen and I was completely electrified I'd never heard anything like that
not that I had an education that wasn't interested in morality and in philosophy and in the face of humanity but the urgency of the way in which he described the importance of truth struck me very deeply and has never left me
there is the man interestingly and amusingly when you go looking for pictures on the internet and I did go looking for this picture
but when you download it for a slide a little thing at the bottom a little bar pops up alt text something like this and it shows person with beard and
there we are this is the book I have this little pamphlet I'm sure it's been reproduced but his quotation was of a Russian proverb one word of truth and a
outweighs the whole world I want you to think about that because at the end of my second talk I'm going to talk about what we can do and one of the things that people are unfounded by is
I'm so small and it is so big what impact can I have I think the answer is you can have an enormous impact locally but I don't want to anticipate what I'm going to say later
and then of course there's another person with beard
no she doesn't dare say a man with a beard but a person with a beard and this of course is Fyodor Dostoevsky and amongst many things that he had to say
was above all do not lie to yourself and it's a very important point because the point that he makes
is and I hope you can see the text up there I can't actually see it to read it but you can read it yourself
so it's rather annoying when a lecturer puts up a text and starts reading it to you but so read it and take it in
but the point that he's making is that when you lie to yourself you become less than human and your
relations with others are falsified debased and that ultimately the reason for not lying to yourself is love
without truth we cannot trust those words of course are cognate in their origin and without trust we cannot love
but we live above all in an age in which we don't know what or whom to trust truth and trust are central
and they are related to belief because when we say true we're really analogizing with the relationship
everything in the cosmos everything is relational in the matter with things I argue and I'm not alone in this
fortunately physicists say this that relations are prior to relata the things that are related and that that sounds very odd to
how can there be relations if there aren't already things to relate but of course those things only become
things because of the web of relations that they're in you are only you because of the context of everything else
that you experience and the society in which you grow up and to which you hope I hope to give back
and beliefs are like this too the root of belief is
Lieben in German and we had the word leaf in Elizabethan English
so Shakespeare will have a character saying my leaf lord my dear lord whatever it is
now belief is and the German word glauben which means to believe is also rooted in Liebe love
and what one is saying is not that I can prove that this thing is true in a kind of laboratory sense
but I give it my fidelity I give it my trust I place my trust my truth in it
unfortunately a lot of people approach religions as though they were a sort of test in how many impossible things you can
assent to before breakfast but that's not really it's not really a matter of propositions although it's often put in that way
it's a matter of dispositions and this is actually a difference between the left hemisphere state
I want to have this absolutely black and white what is the truth here and the truth is a thing that you can find by following steps
and the right hemisphere sense that it is a relationship it is one of trust but that trust is not blind
it's no more blind than if you are swording a stream and someone on the other side reaches out a hand to you
you don't take a blind leap of faith you answer to the hand that is stretched towards you
Dostoyevsky also said the world will be saved by beauty and that's a puzzling saying how could the world be saved by beauty
beauty is beauty is is is it not somehow an add-on well I don't think it is I think it's at the core of everything that matters
and what he meant I think is that though truth can be debased good can be traduced it can be turned into following a certain doctrine
assenting to certain approved beliefs but that is not being good good comes from the heart and so it resists the lie
the beautiful cannot be faked and only whatever certain artists know claim their work shows
that is not what art is doing art is bringing into being for us in a metaphorical sense a beautiful truth
which the soul immediately recognizes cognition is bypassed and it's through our ability to distort cognition
that we are misunderstanding truth and misunderstanding goodness
interestingly I think utilitarianism is a although it's very fashionable in philosophical faculties in the universities is the quintessentially corrupt way of estimating good doing a calculus
but that calculating mind is exactly the mind that goodness calls us to lay aside
so we in the west have descended into utter mediocrity I believe as a result of the ways we've just dismissed
goodness beauty and truth in recent years
but note this is not just another attack on the west
but to point out how it has fallen short of what it once was and has the potential to be
in other words we have become dwarves of ourselves
now as well as the people I've mentioned
there is also Hannah Arendt on truth
a person with cigarette
and
but in this case
no beard
none I can detect
I don't know how she got in actually
the ideals
the ideals
as far as I'm concerned
Hannah Arendt is almost a saint
and her work is so important now
there's almost nobody that if you haven't read them I would more urge you to read
and although her great works were published in the 50s and 60s
and some of them even earlier
they are so prescient of where we are now
and they're not prescient because she could imagine something happening
because she'd seen it happen
she'd seen totalitarianism
she was at a little distance from it
but she was able all the more readily to see how it had happened
so what she says is
the ideal subject of totalitarian rule
is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist
but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction
i.e. the reality of experience
and the distinction between true and false
i.e. the standards of thought
no longer exist
that should make us sit up I think
the level of political debate these days is lamentable
and I've seen it plummet during my lifetime
both in Britain and in America
if you look at some of the politicians
the caliber of them
and the way in which they were able to discuss among themselves
in a reasonably harmonious way
is so much of a wake-up call
when we look at the caliber of politicians we have now
and the kind of easy mudslinging
that seems to be substituting for serious thought
about the predicament we're in
and there's also an unfortunate tendency to talk down to the population
which I blame a certain cast of middling intellect
middling politics middling whatever
people who have taken over the big institutions
and their mediocrity dictates everything for us
it's common that whenever people persuade finally Channel 4
to put on a marvelously interesting documentary or film
everybody says why can't we have more of this
but when the same filmmakers I'm talking about this
because I know this has happened in my experience
go to them and say
here's another one
they go oh no it's too difficult
they won't get it
so we're all being dumbed down all the time
and the trouble is when you dumb people down like that
they behave as though they're dumbed down
because they actually become dumbed down
and the idea of people being held to high standards
is now something that is considered undemocratic
but without it a civilization simply will quickly collapse
and those standards are being not met all around me every day
the idea of a democracy is not that we should all be equally crass in our tastes
and throw away anything that requires dedication and talent
reward the lazy and dull or seek amusement in the basis of most trivial distractions
but what we're being offered is a sinister looking
fact I'm not a parent
you know I don't have some sort of paranoid theory
and I'm going to talk about where all this comes from
but there is a sense in which we're being offered metaphysical or metaphorical opiates
Huxley's Soma
to keep the people distracted from the real issues
and above all keep them from having a life
because then they might act spontaneously
they might even learn to love one another
they might form cohesive opposition to the powers that be
even notice that they're being ripped off and disempowered
and so the need to divide
to encourage resentment
grievance
discord
aggression
disgust
and contempt
division
where there should be tolerance
and patient attempts
at mutual understanding
self-interest and greed
are there in the place of pride
in the spirit of collaboration
that builds a functional society
and all this is very typical
I'm not going to go into hemisphere theory at all
because I assume that probably if you're here
you either have already read or will very shortly read
something I've written that will make it clear
but this is all very in keeping with the left hemisphere
particularly the emotional Tarenborough
so the left hemisphere is not unemotional as people used to say
it's the locus primus of aggressive feelings
and its general attitude is disgust, contempt
and the fueling of me, me, me and discord
so it is a serious point
but I just put it before you and pass on
we're being made passive
so Hannah Arendt again
for even now
labouring is too lofty, too ambitious a word
for what we're doing
or think we're doing
in the world we have come to live in
the last stage of the labouring society
the society of job holders
demands of its members a sheer automatic functioning
the only active decision still required of the individual
is to abandon his individuality
the still individually sensed pain and trouble of living
and acquiesce in a dazed, tranquilised, functional type of behaviour
bring any bells?
it's quite conceivable that the modern age
which began with such an unprecedented
and promising outburst of human activity
may end in the deadliest, most sterile
passive history
sorry, passivity that history's ever known
so we must not be passive
Arendt warned, as you know
that loss of faith in the institutions
is a precursor to totalitarianism
and I'm afraid I have lost faith in institutions
I once felt pride in
our great universities
that I was honoured to be a member of
our healthcare system that I was honoured to serve in
our police, our armed forces, our government
no longer command respect
no longer seem to know where they're going
or what they're doing
and part of this is a loss of innocence
in other words nobody thinks innocently
any more about things that have value in themselves
in its place there's a shallow knowingness
a cynicism
which seems clever
but interestingly psychological experiments show
that people who are cynical are of lower IQ
so it's not clever
those who are intelligent
don't need to be cynical about things
but people who are protecting themselves
because they don't really understand
adopt a cynical view
and I think of those great lines of Yeats
from the second coming
the blood dim tide is loosed
and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned
in other words
there's an instrumentalising of everything
and it changes its nature in that process
AI compounds the problem a thousand fold
AI generated evidence may support
whatever narrative the international conglomerates
wish to propagate
I say the international conglomerates
because although traditionally there has been
a sort of opposition perhaps
between the public sector and the private sector
I believe that they now embody exactly the same drives
and work in a kind of combination
which is very hard for us to resist
they are working at supranational levels
at global levels
where they're no longer accountable
to a population that elected them
and can carry on the fantasies
the world economic forum
as David was saying
proposes
so
at the same time
it may propagate a narrative
and claim there is evidence
from the point of view
that suits those conglomerates
but it may also of course
monitor and suppress
any kind of thinking
that doesn't align with that narrative
above all
of course
AI has no conception of what I mean by innocence
it doesn't really believe in anything
of course
it can't actually
in any way
help us humans
except by taking work
that is tedious out of our hands
and even there
it is not succeeding
as I shall explain
we don't want to be more machine-like
we need to be better humans
and none of that will help us become better humans
I'm not going to do a lot about epistemology
I wrote about it at great length in the second part of the matter with things
but effectively I'm asking where do we go to find truth
and I've suggested that there are four main pathways
they are science, reason, intuition and imagination
and in short I show that each of these has its value
each of these has its limitations
but ultimately we've been obsessed with science and reason
as the only way to achieve insights into the nature of reality
and indeed certain people have become very famous like Dan Kahneman
even got a Nobel Prize for writing a book which decries intuition
his own work can be easily falsified
and although intuition can deceive us
so can lines of reasoning
so can science
in fact one way of thinking of science is
it's the process of untruth towards truth
so science is always provisional and in process
now some people might think that I'm therefore attacking science and reason
quite the opposite
I believe they're terribly important
and I believe they are under attack now
so for example in the humanities
when I was growing up the process was started by Marxism
in which everything was diminished and compressed
and chopped off on the procrastine bed of a certain political doctrine
and then this was followed by deconstructionism
which basically said there is no truth and whatever I want to say is fine
this is utterly irresponsible
it was wrong and it was taking the basis from under the really important fruits of human creativity
so I do think that truth is very important in the humanities
but truth is also very important in science
and I regret to say that Nature, the oldest and most prestigious science journal in the world
has recently adopted a line that if research reveals uncomfortable truths that don't fit with whatever the approved politically correct narrative is
they won't publish it
now once that happens
where are we?
science is our lodestar
when we can't trust the science
we can't trust them to just tell us what they found
but instead to go, no, well these are things that are unsafe for you to know
then we've lost something very important
and of these, I mean reason two is being suborned
Marcuse argued that rationality was being transformed
from a critical force into one of adjustment and compliance with the system of life created by modern industry
those were his words
now, the real world
precisely because it is a presence
not, it's a living presence
not a representation
that's a distinction between what the right hemisphere knows
and the left hemisphere's map
but the very presence of life
it cannot be represented in concepts and language
without distorting its essence
we can write about things, we can argue about them
but we should always be aware that what we're doing is grossly simplifying
what experience has told us and cannot be fully articulated
has often to remain implicit
because once it's made explicit it becomes something else
I mean this is obviously true about all the things that really matters to us
love, poetry, music, architecture, art, ritual, myth, story, religion
all these things have truths that once they're reduced to the language of the dishwasher manual
is betrayed
it is no longer has the power that is in its essence
so that is, it's not a weakness of the right hemisphere that it doesn't have language
it realizes that language was a kind of a virus that had got in
and it sequestered it in the left hemisphere largely
the right hemisphere understands language
understands it actually better than the left hemisphere
but it doesn't compose the sentences that make for, you know, scientific prose
and, you know, and both of these are okay
but it's not a weakness in the right hemisphere that it has decided not to use language
because it realizes that language will distort
so the left hemisphere misconception is that truth is simple
can be fully known, is single, black and white, all or nothing, and independent of context
but as Oscar Wilde said
truth is rarely pure and never simple
mistaking part of the truth for the whole is one of the problems
I'm trying to think of the exact quote
but Whitehead said
all truths are partial truths
it's treating them as the whole truth that plays the devil
and I often think of the insight of John Stuart Mill
that where there have been arguments in philosophy
it has most often been not that people were wrong in what they asserted
but that they were wrong in what they denied
and if we could remember that
that there may be more than one truth about something
and that both points of view or all points of view need to be heard
we might be less in the pickle we're in
and actually that sentiment was voiced by Leibniz over a century earlier in one of his letters
so it is a point that has a good pedigree
and context changes everything
the context of a remark can completely reverse its meaning
and context is what we don't take into account
when we think that the things are in themselves absolutely the truth
as again Whitehead said the real question to ask is not is this true or not
but in which circumstances can it be said to be true
and in which can it be said to be false
and often just because a move we've made in one direction works
it doesn't follow that making more and more steps in that direction will make things better
often it makes them manifestly worse
truths always come with their opposite truths
something that the great physicists of the last century understood
that obviously the everyday truths don't carry with them a shadow of an untruth
either I had milk in my coffee this morning or I didn't
but when it comes to the really big questions the really big truths
every angel has its devil and every devil has its angel
so what is real is in process it's an encounter
everything that we experience and know is out of an encounter
of what I have in me with what the world that I'm encountering gives to the meeting
and so truth is always happening
but it is not the case that it is made up emphatically not
you can't just say anything and say well that's my truth
I mean that's just a really cool whole idea of truth
now here I want to just say something about the importance of imagination
so we are obsessed of course with newness as novelty
but there's another way of newness which is newness of further unpacking
the truth that is there and that requires imagination
imagination is the opposite of fantasy
Wesley Cole wrote about this very persuasively
so fantasy is what takes you away from reality
but imagination is the only chance you have of entering into reality
if you don't use your imagination
you remain remote from whatever it is that you are encountering
so all is changing and making a new all all the time
but not from nowhere
it's not like we should uproot everything and just start again
it's an unfolding like the unfolding of a bud in a plant
like the movement of a stream
is what is new good or bad
well it depends on the goal
the nature and the degree of the change
so that's what I say
and this is also
thank you
and this is
this is true of everything including AI
that it depends on why it's being used
how it is experienced by the humans who interact with it
and the degree to which it is allowed to intervene or interfere
so truth imagination and creation go together
all our experience is an act of creation
we are always creating the world
not just out of ourselves
but out of a stream
that comes from the past
of which we are the product
and goes towards the future
that we have a duty to preserve
and hand on in reasonable order
to those who come after us
so the creative cause
I think this is the nature of the cosmos
that one thing you can say about it
is always creating stuff
it is always unpacking something new
so we start with a very simple thing
and then it explodes
and all kinds of things come into existence
and the one and the many
are very important dipole
to bear in mind together
it's not all one
and it's not all many
but the many
is not an opposition to the one
you know
people go to me
man all is one
and I go yeah
and all is many
so now what
the thing is that
this business of the unfolding
of what is implicit
into the explicit
is the cosmos discovering
its own nature
it may be the divine ground of being
exploring what it has the capacity to make
and feeling it reflected in another
so it's like this
the unfolding bud
doesn't destroy the plant
it fulfills the plant
it's unfolded now
but it's
it's
it's not lost
this process is important
and of course
there's David Bohm's
work on
the implicit
and
the implicate order
famous book
he wrote about
the physics of
of the cosmos
and
what is sometimes
forgotten
is that
he believes that
it not only was a matter of unfolding
what was in folded
but then further in folding the new whole
so that it could unfold again into something new
so there's always this dance
of coming together
and separating
Goethe said
dividing the united
and uniting the divided
is the whole work of nature
and my god did that man know something
imagination also helps us see things afresh
so the famous lines from the defense of poetry by Shelley
it purges from our inward sight
the film of familiarity which obscures from us the wonder of our being
it compels us to feel that which we perceive
and to imagine that which we know
it creates anew the universe
after it has been annihilated in our minds
by the recurrence of impressions blunted by reiteration
so imagination is the faculty whereby we nurture reality into being
it's not the faculty whereby we fashion an already existing reality
that's not sort of in a cupboard waiting to be discovered
it is actually coming into being in our process of contact with it
imagination is inextricably bound up with reality in a way that it's bedfellow fantasy is not
now there's a lot of confusion about what we can know
and this comes from the fact we live in a world of data
of enormous quantities of data
and this leads to many misunderstandings when we come to AI
quite clearly there's a difference between data information
and any capacity for this to have any meaning
it only has meaning when a consciousness that's able to put these things in a context
can create knowledge or at any rate an explanation
so one up from data is an explanation
but explanation is not to understand
I can you say I don't really understand music
I can explain to you how harmonics work
how composers write
how these things are brought into being when they're played
but I can't help you understand the music for that
something else in other words imagination and intuition is required
above explanation which is just unfolding something within a certain context
as long as I imagine that the world is a sequence of events that trigger one another
then I can explain how something comes into being and that's valuable
but it's restricted
there's further knowledge
and knowledge is of two types
which in most languages other than English are distinguished by different verbs
so for example in French there is a distinction between Savoie
to know the facts
and Cornette to know from experience
and in German the similar distinction between Wissen and Kennen
so for example I know Savoie that Paris is the capital of France
but I know Paris Cornette because I spent three years living there
and had an embodied experience of it
which gave me a different kind of path to understanding
it's a more royal road to understanding than its partner
and here there are requirements for intuition and imagination
and when it comes to wisdom
a fortiori we need intuition and imagination
now in a left hemisphere dominant world
and those of you know my work will know that I believe that
there is a gross imbalance between what the right hemisphere could tell us
we stopped listening to it
and it knows far more and is more intelligent literally
both emotionally and socially yes
but also cognitively in terms of IQ
it is more intelligent
it is far more in touch with reality than the left hemisphere
the left hemisphere is good for purposes of grabbing and getting
and that is what it is specialized for
but it is not specialized for understanding
now this left hemisphere dominated world rejects truth for four reasons
the left hemisphere is just less veridical
in fact it is often frankly delusional
and it is not just me saying that
I can quote numbers of neuroscientists or neurologists to be more truthful
those who actually understand what goes on in the lab in terms of what happens with human beings
when people have a right hemisphere
and they are trying to construe reality just from the left hemisphere
they become deluded in the most striking way
secondly the left hemisphere only has a map
which is a very diminished version of reality
and of course it is not important for it to have all the other information
a map is not more useful for having more and more information on it
in fact it becomes unusable at a certain point
its great strength is that it selects only a skeletal structure of reality
and thirdly it prizes internal consistency over new evidence
so if it discovers something
oh god that means I've probably been wrong about this
it goes no no no that must be wrong
I'm going to find a way of fitting it into my picture
and fourth its sole value is utility and power
it's the exertion of power over the world to control it
all is instrumentalized
and tools of power
governmental or technological
are self-selected to go to the very hands in which you don't want power to reside
who most commonly seek control
psychopaths
but utility is not the only value
so at the bottom here
this is Shaler's pyramid of values
that those of you who know my work would have seen probably more than once
I think it's terribly important
he thought there was a hierarchy of values
and at the bottom were the values of utility and power and pleasure
which is like this is good for me
above those there are the Lebenswerte
which are the values of life
so there are things like courage, magnanimity, generosity, forgiveness, greatness of mind
all these things that are very important in a society
above them were the Geistigerwerte
and interestingly in German
which often makes distinctions we don't
intellect and spirit come together in the word Geist
but these are basically the platonic virtues of beauty, goodness and truth
and at the top of the pyramid is das Heilige, the holy
now I've shown here and elaborated that in what I've written
that effectively the right hemisphere sees that the lower levels support the top
but the left hemisphere sees the top as merely an excuse for finding utility and power
and so on down this
only fools and suckers espouse virtues that will cost them
because they aid others in society
but who but a loser would do a thing like that
so I've talked about the humanities and truth and all of that
and I note on passant in the way the debates in the humanities now go
the emotional timbre of the left hemisphere
anger, disgust, narcissism
in our world wrote Orwell in 1984
there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph and self-abasement
there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy
last night I was talking to someone who's undoubtedly in the in the auditorium today
and he was saying if you had to redesign a curriculum for doctors what would it be
and I said well actually the first thing to do is to select the right people
because of things that can't be taught if you either get them or you don't
and he said sense of humor and I thought absolutely spot on
the sense of humor is so important
and sense of humor is being censored and driven out of our lives
and you know I'm a great fan of and a friend
I'm proud to call myself a friend of John Cleese
and I think his humor is one of the reasons for living
and you know he went to Sarajevo and he was greeted by somebody who said you know you saved my life
and he said how did I do that well when we were under siege my daughter was murdered
and we just didn't know how to live how to sleep or anything
but in the basement of a multi-story car park we set up a cinema
and we invited everybody we knew in and we played largely your Monty Python
and 40 Towers and all these things and they filled us with a sense that okay it's worth living
I think that is such a wonderful story
so no educated person I think should be unwilling to engage in civil respectful discussion
to quote Solzhenitsyn again it's a universal law tolerance is the sorry intolerance is the first sign of an inadequate education
all ill-educated people behave with arrogant impatience whereas truly profound education breeds humility
and I think the new religion of wokeness says discord in place of love
speaks of freedom but is coercive in the opinions that it will allow to hear expressed
is superior self-regarding mocking and aims to ruin the lives of those who dare to disagree
the goal is absolutely not tolerance for all but intolerance
there is a frontal assault on any standards by which you can appeal to reason or truth
if my truth is as good as any other truth there is it so fact of no truth
and if there is no truth we are utterly lost
education I had thought was about enlarging not narrowing the mind
as is well known the Greek word for truth
aletheia means an unconcealing
so it's not that truth is there sitting on a table
and I take the necessary steps I find truth
but truth is a matter of clearing away as Michelangelo produces David
he didn't put it together he just threw away stone for years
and at the end of it there it was
what has seen since time immemorial been accepted is ipso facto inverted
and its opposite made obligatory
we're not progressing in intellect we're throwing away the hard one
and I mean hard one through hardship through battle in many cases
the hard one knowledge skill and insight that could have helped us out of our folly
what does the crisis of mental illness and the sheer scale of unhappiness in our society
tell us about our experiment in destroying a society
and why do scientists value truth at all
if they believe the universe is meaningless and pointless and simply lump and matter coinciding
and hitting and bouncing and so on
why worry about truth
surely in that world the only decent thing to do is to increase pleasure
and if lies will make people happier why not follow them
but amazingly these people know they think truth is very important
I think truth is very important
I think it's absolutely important in science and everywhere
but why would somebody who had no belief in anything beyond the material think it's important
both humanities and science should be in pursuit of the evolution of the new and the vital
but this requires encouraging an organic growth
not a cutting off from our sources
but like chaining a plant
you can make it go many places
but you don't do it by breaking the stem and sticking it on a wall
you chain it there
but the left hemisphere produces something that is the opposite of creativity
it produces sameness
and in two senses
so one is that the manifold becomes the uniform
and the second is that it endlessly repeats itself
now this is interesting because a number of commentators have noticed that technology peaked in its value around 2015-2015
up till that point it has shown itself to be indeed very useful
but since then it has mainly impeded progress
taken up more time
unnecessarily complicated what intuition can lead us towards
and has generally starved us of time and energy
so tech has become less helpful and is now slowing us down and getting in the way of creativity
and interesting about the same time the internet had been up to that point interested in what people seem to like and giving them it
but now it refers at a different level to what the internet gathers we like
so there are algorithms that dictate it that are no longer in touch with what people really like
so in a way this is the beginning of many vicious circles
when you ask chat GPT a question it goes out and does a trolley dash around the internet
and comes back with a vanilla milkshake
which is a kind of a kind of mishmash of received you know acceptable opinion
but of course for us to be alive intellectually we need to debate we need to have different points of view represented
Wikipedia is appalling in this
it treats anything that is not already mainstream science as quote pseudo science
so how is it going to get to be the science of the future which it sometimes may well be
most things that we believe now that science shows us at one time were not what science thought
science has to evolve
and once AI becomes our source of knowledge on reality let alone our path to understanding it
all variety of views all freshness of thought is banished from the world
this is because it's programmed to favour consensus views
this is thought control on a whole different level from anything predicted by Orwell and Huxley
and the left hemisphere specialises in vicious circles
I mean this is true about the brain structure and I haven't got time to explain it
but effectively the right hemisphere has much more broad ranging connections across many areas
so it is constantly seeking different points of view from different parts of that hemisphere
whereas when you exercise thought in the left hemisphere it narrows down concentrically to an area where it thinks the truth lies
but of course it may not
it might be like that man who was found looking for his keys under a street lamp
they were where did you leave them? I lost them over there
why are you not looking over there? because there's no light over there
so that is the way we are now regressing not progressing
and by the way I would want to say that nothing I'm saying has anything to do with left or right in a political sense
I think those labels are completely mistaken
and I think there are left hemispheric people on the right and on the left
and right hemispheric people on the right and on the left
what I'm talking about is something that embraces capitalism and bureaucracy
both drain our vitality
capitalism trivialises, disregards the preciousness of all it exploits and helps to destroy
thrives on aggressive competition and discontent
promotes atomism and unrest
meanwhile bureaucracy wastes our creativity, our freedom and our time
which is all we have, it is our life
and things that used to take five minutes because you could ring and then speak to a person
now you waste a whole morning going round and round up to another platform
and you know it's extraordinary because of course we now cannot bypass this
and we cannot get to real people
and if we do they're equipped with an algorithm which means that they're more or less working like her
so impoverished society adopts these harmful policies such as
such as DEI as though this were a substitute for virtue
and both think the big businesses and the bureaucracies
that we cannot see through that as a ploy
both propagate the left hemisphere mentality in the world
which AI now hardens up
and at the same time that we're minutely controlling the minds of people
we're not actually controlling their actions where they are harmful
so the police no longer seem to be able or willing to prosecute people for violent behaviour
in the street for shoplifting for crime that is escalating
probably because they're too busy back in the station going through people's Twitter feed
in order to find a non-crime thought crime incident
and then recording it somewhere
any society other than ours would have found this and a host of other fantasies
now banded around as gospel truth
unimaginably absurd
which one is the blind one?
all those wise people who live before us
or we just in the last 15 years has suddenly become terribly wise
I'm not sure
and I think AI is like putting machine guns in the hands of toddlers
because in order to use it properly we need to have wisdom
and wisdom is plummeting at the same time that power is growing
so is it a servant or a tyrant?
well it's always presented as your servant
but I might point out that any harmful innovation you like to name
was without exception presented as for your benefit
it's the sinister and serious aspect of those silly letters that you get
in order to improve our service to you we're going to stop doing all the things you wanted us to do
and here Hannah Arendt is interesting
so in her marvellous book on violence which you should all be reading
as well as the human condition
she wrote
it's as though we've fallen under a fairyland spell
remember this is
this is
I don't know
80 years ago
we've fallen under a fairyland spell
which permits us to do the impossible
on the condition that we lose the capacity of doing the possible
to achieve fantastically extraordinary feats
on the condition of no longer being able to attend properly to our everyday needs
so
yes you can always point to some machine that does something quite unnecessary
and is extravagant on energy and time
but can simulate walk about a room and look like a person
but actually you can't do simple things like pay your gas bill
so this is a colossal expense of time
and resource
Pavel Kohut
a
Czech thinker
who corresponded with Gunter Grass
foresaw a world ruled over by an elite that derives its power
quote from the councils of intellectual aids
who actually believe that men in think tanks are thinkers
and that computers can think
quote the councils may turn out to be incredibly insidious and instead of pursuing human objectives
may pursue completely abstract problems that had been transformed in an unforeseen manner in the artificial brain
can it bring us leisure
well again Hannah Arendt
it is a society of labourers which is about to be liberated from the fetters of labour
and this society no longer knows of those higher and more meaningful activity for the sake of which this freedom was won
within the society which is egalitarian because this is labour's way of making men live together
there is no class left
no aristocracy of either a political or spiritual nature
from which a restoration of the other capacities of man could start anew
we need seed beds of people
not
the term hierarchy is a little unfortunate
but what she's really saying is
there is excellence
there was excellence
we need that excellence
and we're losing it
we're in the grip of an ideology yes
but it's not even that
we're a force of some kind
we know not what
that is not political
but perhaps a cerebral malaise
of what kind
are we knowingly and willingly attacking ourselves
or does the drive come from somewhere else
well I would say both
in other words
it's rather like cancer or parasitosis
so bureaucracy is like a cancer
that draws the resources that were destined for teachers for doctors or whatever
and builds a shiny big building
awards itself huge salaries
and proliferates at the expense of the host organism which it is supposed to serve
and AI is a parasite
it has ripped off human creativity
and try
all it can do is try to imitate it
this is an incredible impoverishment of
which we've never consulted about
and it feeds back to us a very basic question
so the thing about cancer is it is our cells
it's not somebody else's cells
the thing about parasites is they get into our system
and we are a host to I think it's 36 trillion bacteria
on many of which our life depends
we need them
they're commensal organisms
in other words literally they sit at the same table with us
and
but this is a parasite
and it's expressed in managerialism
and it's both external and internal
and this is entirely consonant with the idea of a drive that is frankly evil
I don't
I don't flinch from that word
because I have never bought the idea that evil is just an absence of good
evil I have experienced it
I've been a psychiatrist
I've led a life
I have definitely experienced evil
it has a drive of its own
which it is sort of diminished to say that it's simply an absence of something
it is a presence
and
it doesn't mean it's necessarily outside of us
it acts through us
as good acts
and can only act through us
so the big corporations institutions simulate diseases in this way
the right hemisphere explores
but the left hemisphere merely exploits
in other words it is parasitic
and what's more
it only wants
and only understands
what it itself has made
it's not in tune
with whatever else exists
with what for reasons of brevity one might call nature
and evil is not just greed though
and again it's an irrational lust for power for its own sake
and according to Hannah Arendt
a distinctive feature of radical evil is that it isn't done for humanly understandable motives
such as self-interest
but merely to reinforce totalitarian control
and the idea that everything is possible
I hope, yes
this is a cartoon by George Grosch
from Between the Wars
it says a lot in a very small image
the future man says Hannah Arendt
whom the scientists tell us they will produce in no more than a hundred years
seems to be possessed by a rebellion against human existence as it has been given
a free gift from nowhere
secularly speaking
which he wishes to exchange as it were for something he has made himself
and as a result
we come to this prescient phrase
from the Austrian novelist
Ferdinand Kuhnberger
life no longer lives
when I read those words
even saying them now
they send a chill down my spine
but who of us does not understand
that vitality is draining away
that spontaneity is being taken away
that choice and freedom are being taken away
that the characteristics of life have been supplanted by mechanism
the birth rate is falling
physical sexual relations are now too dangerous
so teenagers prefer to indulge in pornography
and glue themselves to the internet
rather than dealing with people
who may suddenly turn on them and ruin their career or sue them
dance has become solipsistic
art has become cynical
and what has happened to the ability to do something
just on the spur of the moment
the right hemisphere was the dominant feature of the great periods of human creativity
in both art and science
as I explored in the Master and His Hemisphere
what does live is the lie
and it's been pointed out that in the war between the real and the bogus
the bogus is now preferred
so on the internet if you go for an image of somebody
it will give you one created by an AI
before it will give you the photograph of the real person
psychopaths actually prefer to lie
and do so needlessly
not for benefit
but just because they're addicted to the power of a lie
and so do utilitarians
those who cannot understand goodness
coming together then
AI and capitalism exploit us
are parasitic
I gather there was a woman with 713,000 TikTok followers
who generated 11 million views for her videos
and this is all to do with the money that is paid for advertising associated with these things
and she got paid $1.85
the CEO of Spotify which is purely parasitical
is reportedly richer than any musician in history
AI requires piracy on a vast scale sucking dry human creativity
if AI were as we told revolutionizing fields such as healthcare
life expectancy should be rising
not falling as it is
mental health should show progress
rather than a catastrophic decline
the like of which we have never seen before
if AI were all its claim to be
wouldn't we see human society thriving
not becoming less stable and less benign
with every passing day
disempowerment has hit us
with the confluence of three important forces
global conglomerates
the central state
and above all the international bodies and forces
that are not accountable to any country
where there are citizens
the nature of unaccountability
is wonderfully explored in Dan Davis's book
the unaccountability machine
why big systems make terrible decisions
and how the world lost its mind
so I'm just
my last reflection is from Hannah Arendt
the greater the bureaucratization of public life
the greater will be the attraction of violence
in a fully developed bureaucracy
there's nobody left with whom one can argue
to whom one can present grievances
on whom the pressures of power can be exerted
bureaucracy is the form of government
in which everybody is deprived of political freedom
of the power to act
for the rule by nobody is not no rule
and where all are equally powerless
we have a tyranny without a tyrant
no one is responsible anymore
but we must be responsible
and in my second lecture
I will talk about how we do that
thank you very much
thank you very much
