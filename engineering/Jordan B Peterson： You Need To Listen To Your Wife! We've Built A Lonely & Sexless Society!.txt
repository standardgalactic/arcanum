We know that couples have lived together before the marriage actually increases the probability
that the relationship will fail, and the reason for that is very straightforward.
And talking of things that risk harming relationships, a subject we've never spoke about before, is...
Oh yeah, and that's a huge reason sex has disappeared.
People need to stop doing that.
Jordan Peterson, the psychology professor people love or love to hate.
He's undeniably one of the greatest intellectual phenomenons on the planet.
And many view him as the ultimate father figure.
Welcome back, Mr. Peterson.
We're built for maximal challenge, and that isn't the way we view ourselves in the modern world.
We view ourselves as built for consumption and pleasure, for example, watching pornography.
But what are the downstream consequences of that?
Well, first of all, it's easy.
To get what?
Sexual gratification.
But does it matter?
Oh, it's a catastrophe. You're not desperate anymore.
And if you're going to have the true adventure of your life, you're going to need love, shame, guilt, desperation, and pain.
Like, it's hard, but now people take the easy road, like avoiding conflict, for example.
And I spent a lot of time studying evil.
It arises when good men hold their tongue.
Now, you may suffer some consequences of speaking, but retreating one step at a time defensively,
that makes you sick of yourself, there's nothing worse that can happen to you.
You want your life to be unbearably entertaining.
And maybe all the sorrow and catastrophe has to be part of it, because otherwise there's...
There's nothing about it that's glorious.
This has always blown my mind a little bit.
53% of you that listen to this show regularly haven't yet subscribed to this show.
So could I ask you for a favour before we start?
If you like the show and you like what we do here and you want to support us,
the free, simple way that you can do just that is by hitting the subscribe button.
And my commitment to you is if you do that, then I'll do everything in my power, me and my team,
to make sure that this show is better for you every single week.
We'll listen to your feedback.
We'll find the guests that you want me to speak to, and we'll continue to do what we do.
Thank you so much.
Your book comes at a really interesting time in my life personally.
Your book is called We Who Wrestle With God.
And it's my belief and suspicion that there's a lot of people wrestling with God at the moment.
And when I say the word God, I don't necessarily mean some man in the sky with a beard.
What I really mean is a greater meaning, a greater sense of meaning.
The world feels like, and you speak to this in the book,
that it's gotten more and more individualistic and there's consequence to that.
Fractionated is another way of thinking about it, right?
Because you can think about it as individualistic, and that's a positive spin, so to speak.
But alienated, isolated, and fractionated is the, what would you say, is the accompaniment to that.
See, I think the case is that the liberal experiment in individualism only works when the conservative foundation is in place, right?
If you aggregate people together and they share enough fundamental values, especially of a particular sort,
then you can concentrate on the individual and individual freedom.
But there's a lot of preconditions for that.
And, you know, the Scottish liberals, so the ones who really established Western liberalism as a philosophical and political movement, they knew that.
You know, it was individual liberty, Judeo-Christian substructure, and that was an assumption.
Now, the problem with modern liberalism is that that underlying foundation has become extremely shaky,
and everyone feels it, and that's what the culture war is about, fundamentally, and that fact is invalidating the fractionated liberal experiment.
Partly, see, it's partly because we have the wrong conception of identity, fundamentally.
Identity is a hierarchical structure, so we kind of think that you end at your boundaries as an individual, but you don't, because...
Well, you're probably not going to want to be alone, so then let's say you're married, okay?
So now, your identity as a husband, that's a social identity, and then you have an identity as a father, that's a social identity.
Then you have an identity as a member of your community, and a member of your city, and a member of your state, and a member of your nation.
And then you're involved in a metaphysical endeavor that constitutes the foundation for the nation, let's say.
That would be one nation under God, that's one way of thinking about it, or you could think about it as the self-evident truths that underlie the state.
Your identity exists at all those levels, and then your mental health isn't something you carry around in your head.
It's the harmony that exists or doesn't exist between all those levels, and that isn't how liberal individualists think about identity at all.
And that's because they were, for a long time, fortunate enough so all those other strata were in place.
So where do we find ourselves now, if we don't have that hierarchy, and we aren't held in place by all those layers and sort of social and, I guess, family identities?
Hmm, adrift in a storm, alone.
So, look, here's an interesting fact.
So, psychologists who are statistically minded, they're called psychometricians, they're psychologists who are obsessed, research psychologists,
who are obsessed with measurement and concept definition, spent a lot of time aggregating concepts.
These were, in some ways, what they were doing was equivalent to the development of early large language models.
So, psychologists were at the forefront of that on the statistical side.
Words that we use to describe people clump together.
So, for example, if you're extroverted, you're social, and you're happy, you're enthusiastic.
Okay, so those clump together.
If you're anxious, you also tend to be frustrated, disappointed, grief-stricken, and in pain.
All the negative emotions clump.
Words associated with your empathy, aggregate.
Words associated with your dutifulness, aggregate.
And so do words associated with creativity.
Those are the five fundamental dimensions of temperament.
One of the words that clumps with negative emotion is self-consciousness.
Which means that self-consciousness is so tightly associated with suffering that they're not conceptually distinguishable.
Which means, literally, the more you think about yourself, the more miserable you are.
And it makes sense when you understand how social people are.
We're so social that you can take the most anti-social human beings imaginable, so psychopathic criminals,
and you can punish them by putting them in solitary confinement.
That's how social human beings are.
And so, your mental health is way more dependent on your nesting within a social structure
than on your, say, the internal coherence of your belief systems.
In fact, I think it's hardly at all dependent on the internal consistency of your coherence of your belief systems.
It's more like, does anyone like you?
Do you have any friends?
Do you have anyone that loves you?
Or more, or maybe even more profoundly, are there people for whom you make sacrifices?
Right?
That's a very, and it's relevant to the topic of this book, obviously,
because the relationship with the divine in the stories that I'm detailing in this book,
most of them are Old Testament stories,
the relationship with the divine is a sacrificial relationship.
The divine is that to which sacrifice is directed.
Well, if you get married, it's a sacrificial offering
because you sacrifice your potential relationship with all other women to that woman.
What does one do on an individual level if they find themselves in such a society
where individualism has taken hold,
and they can't necessarily easily change the society?
Are there day-to-day, week-to-week choices that I'm making that are pushing me away from that meaning and purpose
and sort of collective, I guess, sense of responsibility?
Like, the individual listening to this now that completely agrees with you finds himself as being a lonely person
and goes, what do I do about this, Jordan?
Well, one of the things you do with disagreeable people who are more inclined by temperament to be competitive
and attain victory for themselves is one of the exercises you can do with disagreeable people.
If you're a disagreeable extrovert, you tend to be narcissistic.
And the problem with that, technically, is that you alienate people.
And the problem with that is, well, you're hyper-social.
So if you alienate people, well, then you don't have anyone.
And not only is that lonesome, but it's also extremely impractical.
I mean, you know, you certainly and no doubt learn this more as you become successful.
It's like, you need a team.
And, right, and the more tightly knit it is and the more you're all working in the same direction,
the better everything works.
It's not useful to be a narcissist because maybe you get what you want right now this time.
But as a propagating strategy across time, it's a degenerating game.
Okay, so what do you do?
Well, instead of thinking about what you want or even thinking about how to strategize
in relationship to your goals, you might think about what you could do for other people.
Or you could think about what you would do if you only did what was true and right.
Those are very different orientations, right?
And the religious orientation, fundamentally, is the orientation towards what is true and right.
And you might say, well, I don't know what's true and right.
It's like, yeah, kind of, because our knowledge is bounded and we're ignorant.
So, do we understand the nature of the highest good?
Well, no, but it's a very rare person who doesn't know some of the time when they're doing something wrong.
And it's also a non-existent person who doesn't have some concept of the good because you can't act without a concept of the good.
Because you act towards a goal you deem desirable.
So, that's up.
I mean, unless you're trying to make your life worse, and people do do that from time to time, but we'll leave that as an exception.
I mean, you have to, you have to have descended into hell in a way before you're in a situation where you're actively working to make your own life worse.
That can happen.
But assuming that you're relatively well embedded in the realm of the normal, then you're moving towards something better always, because otherwise there's no motivation.
We know this technically.
This isn't even disputable.
So, the positive emotion systems that make you enthusiastic, so that fill you with the desire to move towards a goal, independent of fear, say, you know, because you can move towards a safety goal because you're afraid.
But imagine you're trying to accomplish something.
You have a goal.
The positive emotion systems operate to track progress to the goal.
Positive emotion is a consequence of evidence of movement towards a desired goal.
Okay, so now you have a proximal goal, you know, like our proximal goal right now might be just to, like in the most micro level possible, might be to display facial signs of interest in the conversation, right?
It's a very micro goal.
But then that's nested in our desire to have an interesting conversation.
On the topic we're having right now, and then inside the podcast as a whole, and then as part of the podcast enterprise that you're involved in, as part of the book enterprise, let's say that I'm involved in, that's nested inside our view of the world, right?
So, you see, there are nestings of the good that have no upper limit.
That's Jacob's ladder, by the way.
And at the top of that is the good itself.
Which is the divine, for all intents and purposes.
Divine, what do you mean by that?
That's a definition.
That's what I mean, is that in the hierarchy of what's good, the divine is the peak.
The top, okay.
Right.
Now, you don't know what that is.
That's also an insistence in the biblical texts, by the way.
In the final analysis, the divine is ineffable.
It's not definable.
And it's beyond you.
And that's partly because there's a practical reason for that, even.
You know this as well.
As you move towards a goal, let's say you attain a goal.
Okay, now you've accomplished.
Well, are you done?
It's like, no.
A new potential goal emerges, a new pinnacle.
And then maybe you'll accomplish that.
But then a new one exists.
And so, you could say that the domain of opportunity is limitless.
Right.
Because the thing that's at the pinnacle recedes as you approach it.
And that's a, you could say that's a technical definition of God, which is accurate.
That is a technical definition of God.
God is the good towards which all goods point.
These are definitions again.
Remember, they're not proclamations of faith.
They're definitions.
So, we obviously all believe that all good things share something in common.
Because otherwise, we wouldn't have the category good.
And then we all believe that there are rank orders of good.
Because otherwise, everything good would be equally worth pursuing.
No one believes that.
So, there's a rank order.
Well, if there's a rank orders towards some end or some pinnacle,
you can also think about it as a foundation.
Depends on which metaphorical landscape you want to inhabit.
Then the question becomes, well, how do you characterize that which is the ultimate aim?
That which is and should be the ultimate aim?
Well, the stories on which our culture is predicated characterize that in story.
Do you think many people have an ultimate aim in their mind?
They do whether they know it or not.
What do you mean by that?
So, like the average person listening to this now, are they conscious at all of what they're...
No, but it's implicit.
Okay.
One of the things the psychoanalytic thinkers insisted on, Carl Jung in particular, was that everybody acts out a story.
Sometimes it's a tragic story.
Sometimes it's the story of hell.
Like, you're trapped in a story.
One way or another.
Now, do you know the contours of your story?
Not necessarily.
I mean, people are often very bad at describing themselves.
They don't know what they're up to.
That doesn't mean they're not up to something.
And you could also think about them as the battleground between warring stories.
That also happens.
That just means they're fractionated in their psyche.
Yeah, they're being pulled in many directions at the same time.
Someone said to me actually yesterday, they said, an interesting way to understand your self-narrative or your self-story is to answer the question.
If you were a character, a fictional character, who would you be?
Sure.
And in that, you'd figure out whether you have this sort of heroized story or if you're a victim.
So I'll ask you that question.
Yeah, right.
Absolutely.
Which fictional character would you be?
Bugs Bunny.
Bugs Bunny's a trickster character.
Right.
So, yeah.
More serious answer?
Yeah.
Do you ever read The Idiot?
No.
Yeah, well, I'm probably half idiot and half Raskolnikov.
That's another way of looking at it.
Why'd you say that?
The character of The Idiot in Dostoevsky's novel is a holy fool.
It's a strange combination.
A person who's doing things right in a manner that's, I suppose, not obvious.
That looks, that looks, that can easily be confused with naivety or foolishness, playfulness even, I suppose.
Is that how you characterize yourself?
Someone that's doing things right, but in a way that others perceive as foolishness or naivety?
Or even malevolence at times.
You know, I mean, that's partly why people have gone after my reputation.
Does it ever bother you, people going after your reputation or them?
Well, sure.
I mean, sometimes it's like, it's been very distressing, very distressing.
The battles I've had with the College of Psychologists in Ontario, those are no joke.
It's very, very stressful and unconscionable.
So, expensive, hundreds of thousands of dollars, years, it's been 10 years of legal battles, calumny in the press.
They're, they're attempting to undermine my professional credibility with some degree of success.
You know, because when your professional college goes after you, people have to make a choice.
It's either the professional college is corrupt and wrong or the individual being targeted is corrupt and wrong.
It's way easier to draw the second conclusion.
And under most circumstances, in a valid state, that's the correct conclusion.
So, and it was very stressful to find myself embattled at the university, University of Toronto.
I liked working there.
That place had its problems, but it was pretty functional.
And I really liked being there.
I, I enjoyed my career as a professor.
I had great relationships with the undergraduates and my graduate students.
I loved doing my research, which has also disappeared.
So, now, those are the serious disputes that I've had reputationally, let's say.
There's a lot of casual reputation savaging that I don't really care about from journalists and so forth.
Although sometimes that's been pretty brutal because whenever that happened, especially when things just started to be developing around me, let's say, on the public stage.
When, when I encountered a particularly psychopathic journalist, which happened quite often, particularly in the UK, it was completely a toss-up which way it was going to go.
Like, it could have just finished me and my family.
That, that was definitely the case three or four or five times, maybe more than that.
So, yes, it's very bothersome.
Now, now, and really for a long time, all of that takes place within a much broader context.
All the interactions I have with people in my actual life are ridiculously positive.
And what would you say?
Positive and gratifying.
You know, so.
That's a form of suffering in a way, and everybody goes through suffering.
And because you've been through that, have you been able to develop a, a strategy or a, some kind of anchoring that helps you when the wind blows like that?
Well, yeah, oh, definitely.
I mean, I, I had very strong relationships when all of this started to develop around me.
And that's just become more the case, a very tightly knit family and a very tightly knit group of friends.
Now, I lost some more peripheral friends, but, you know, that's unfortunate, but c'est la vie.
So there's that.
Now, is that a strategy?
Well, it's not exactly a strategy because I didn't design it towards an end.
It was more like an end in itself, right?
I mean, I had kids not as a strategic move, but because I like kids.
So, and I particularly like my kids.
So that's not a strategy.
And I really have a great relationship with my wife.
And like, I've known her for 52 years.
It's a very long time.
And she's definitely my best friend and probably has been for 52 years.
And so that's really helpful.
That, that, and that refers back to this issue of identity that we were discussing.
You know, my identity is well-structured in, in the social sense.
And then, in terms of strategy, yeah, I mean, I have a meta strategy, I suppose.
I just say what I think, right?
Now, is that a strategy?
It depends on how you define strategy.
It's not a strategy that's designed to serve my ends.
Not, not in a individualistic way.
So, I'm just trying to see what happens if I say what I think.
That's a way of navigating in the world, right?
It's an adventurous way of navigating in the world.
Because you don't know what's going to happen.
You have to let go of that.
And then there's an element of faith in that, right?
There's faith in everything you do.
You know, the empiricist types, the scientific reductionists, they say,
well, you can move forward in the world without faith.
That's complete bloody rubbish.
There isn't anything you ever do that's important that you don't do in light of faith.
It's like, if you get married, you do that on the basis of the evidence, do you?
What bloody evidence do you have?
You're 23 years old.
You don't know a damn thing.
You know, maybe you're in love with the person that you want to marry,
but you have no evidence whatsoever about how your life is going to go.
None.
You have to leap into the unknown like you do with everything that's important.
That's all faith predicated.
Now, the question is faith in what?
Well, if you decide that you're just going to say what you think,
then you have faith in the truth.
At least insofar as you have access to the truth.
Is it true to say that if you hadn't have said what you think publicly,
then you would have experienced less suffering than you have?
No, I don't think so.
So if you'd said, if you'd stayed in your practice, you know, as a clinical psychologist...
No, because I would have had to not, I would have had to bite my tongue.
And you think that's more...
I know it.
It's not a matter of thinking.
I know it.
I know it.
Absolutely.
100%.
I spent a lot of time studying evil.
A lot of time.
And I know how it arises.
It arises when good men hold their tongue.
You don't want that.
There's nothing worse that can happen to you.
Now, you may suffer some consequences of speaking, for sure.
But all things considered, which is the right attitude if you're wise,
there's nothing worse that can happen to you than to falsify your speech.
Is saying nothing a form of falsifying your speech?
It is when you have something to say.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Because there's a lot of people probably listening now that have a lot they want to say.
Yeah.
But if they say it, they're going to lose their job.
Or there's going to be immediate consequences, which might mean they can't feed their family.
Yeah, it might mean that.
But it also might mean that if they bite their tongue and pretend to be something other than they are,
they'll be a weak model for their children.
And, you know, is that better than having some financial instability?
Maybe, here's a counter proposition, if your job requires you to lie, maybe you should find another job.
Now, look, I also understand that there are strategic considerations in such a decision.
There's no sense martyring yourself stupidly.
And if you're going to say what you believe to be the case,
then you need to put yourself in a position where doing so won't be instantly catastrophic in a way you can't fix.
Because that's not a good, that's not wise.
Now, when things blew up around me, I had three sources of income.
That wasn't accidental.
Now, you know, people say, well, you were fortunate.
It's like, yeah, and careful.
So I didn't want to have all my eggs in one basket.
And that turned out, well, I knew that.
It's like, you have no autonomy if you have all your eggs in one basket.
So if you're going to think strategically, if you're going to think like someone who's at war, let's say,
then you don't leave your, you don't leave a mortal flank exposed.
And so if, you know, here's a rule.
If you find yourself in a position where you're unable to speak, you haven't fortified your territory properly.
Right.
So then you have to think about that.
It's like you think, okay, why can't I say what I believe to be the case?
Where am I vulnerable?
And you can say, well, that's inevitable.
It's like, no, it's not.
It's not inevitable.
That doesn't mean it isn't difficult to fortify and to put yourself in a position where you're on the offense successfully.
That's hard.
But retreating one step at a time defensively for your whole life and shrinking while you do it, that's also not very, that's also difficult.
It's just the kind of difficult that wears you down and makes you sick of yourself.
That's not a good, that's not a good plan.
That's a bad plan.
And did you see this when you were in your clinical practice?
Did you see it in people?
Oh, constantly.
How does it show up on the surface?
What are the words that they say to articulate that this sort of slow diminishing?
Oh, you see that in people's marriages all the time when marriages deteriorate.
A marriage ends in divorce when there's 10,000 fights that haven't been had.
And I really, I'm not just guessing at that number.
It's like, let's say your marriage isn't going very well.
And so you have five uncomfortable quasi disputes a day, just to pick a number.
Maybe it's 50.
Maybe it's three, whatever.
Five will do.
Well, that's 1,500 a year.
Okay.
Now you just aggregate that over, let's say, the 10 years it takes your marriage to collapse.
Well, you've got something approximating 10,000 fights you didn't have.
That's 10,000 times you remain silent when you had something to say.
And they all aggregate.
And then every time, once you've collected the first 5,000, then every time you have a
dispute, all 5,000 are lurking behind that dispute.
And the fact of their existence makes it much less likely that you'll say what you have to say.
That's the reemergence of the dragon of chaos as a consequence of fleeing from your fate.
That's exactly right.
Last time we spoke, you said something which stayed with me, and I've actually forwarded
it to a few of my friends on this particular subject.
You said to me, you're going to have to sit and spend 90 minutes a week speaking to your
partner.
Yeah.
So annoying.
It's so annoying.
It's so annoying, but it's so important.
And so many of my friends that have relationship difficulties, I send them this little four-minute
clip I have on my phone of you saying that.
Because the 90-minute, no, it might be 95 minutes.
It might be 85 minutes.
But the concept of you need to sit down and create a space where she or he or whatever
can tell you what they've noticed.
Why they don't like you.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, it's especially, I think, I don't think that you can really establish the kind of relationship
with a woman that you want with anything in the road.
Like, it's hard for women to give themselves to men, and no wonder.
It's amazing they ever do it.
They have a lot on the line.
What are the preconditions for that offering?
Peace and security.
You can tell if it's, if the territory is being cleared because play emerges.
Right, right.
Play emerges.
And play is a very fragile motivational state.
It can be disrupted by almost anything.
So, if there are impediments to understanding, play will not arise, and then you don't have
the romantic adventure that you want, it's grudging, right?
You don't have a voluntary partner.
And that's a very hard thing to attain, right?
That full voluntary partnership, that means that you're in sync with each other.
You can't expect that to be easy.
You can't even be in sync with yourself.
Like, it's hard.
And you need to keep each other up to date.
You need to know what's going on.
You need to iron out the sources of discomfort or distrust.
And that there's a lot of Dante's Inferno.
What's that?
That, well, Dante's Inferno is a characterization of hell by Dante.
It's one of the most famous poems ever written.
And it's, you can think about it as what you have to do to get to the bottom of things.
So, let's say that you have a dispute with your wife and it's a recurring dispute, right?
It's an issue.
You have an issue.
Well, do you want to address the issue?
It's like, do you want to do surgery without anesthetic?
It's the same question.
Addressing an issue is a journey into the abyss.
Dante placed Satan at the bottom of hell, right?
So, that's the figure of malevolence itself.
Encased in ice and frozen.
So, immobile.
Surrounded by those who betray.
That's the lowest level of hell.
Why?
Well, it's often the case that if you journey into an issue.
Spiral down.
To the bottom, you'll find betrayal.
Right?
Because maybe your partner doesn't trust you because she was betrayed.
Highly probable.
Highly probable.
Or her grandmother was betrayed.
Like, you know, there's bad blood between men and women.
Can you ever solve for that?
So, if I'm in a situation where my partner doesn't trust me because she was betrayed, whether it's something I did or whatever.
How do you ever get rid of the devil at the bottom of the spiral?
Well, you have to find out that it's there.
Okay.
That's a hard question.
You both have to want to.
That's the first thing.
That's the setting of the aim.
What do we want?
We want to play forever in God's heavenly garden.
How about that?
That's a metaphorical representation, right?
But that's a walled garden.
That's the human environment.
The walls are the walls of your house.
The garden is nature displaying itself in its beauty within boundaries.
That's a place that play can take place.
That's what you want.
You've got to think about it.
What do you want?
Okay.
So, now we might ask, what do you mean want?
Okay.
If you were taking care of yourself and you could have what was good for you, what would that be?
Now, that's a hard question, right?
You're going to have to think about that for a long time.
What would satisfy something as someone as miserable and resentful and useless as me, right?
If I could have it.
Now, people will, they don't even want to address that issue because part of the problem with making your aim clear is you know when you're failing.
And people would rather keep the evidence of their failure obscured from themselves, even if it meant continued failure.
But now, let's say you decide not to do that.
You're going to think, okay, I'm going to aim high.
I'm going to take care of myself.
Okay.
Now, your wife's on board with that.
Now, that's a hell of, that's a, that's really what the marital vow is in the final analysis most deeply is that willingness to participate in that game.
Now, you have to tell each other the truth.
What the hell do you want?
Well, she doesn't know and neither do you.
Not really.
So, you got to start digging, finding out and you, and noticing.
It's like now and then you'll see that you're happy with each other.
And maybe it'll happen kind of randomly.
You'll be out in some, I don't know, maybe you're at a restaurant or you're gone for a walk or who knows.
And you'll notice, oh, this is going well.
It's like, oh yeah, this is going well.
What are we doing right?
Could we take that little episode and could we start to expand it?
You know, because one of the things you can do in a marriage is you can notice when things are going well and then you can have a chat with each other and say, look,
I don't know what we did during this period of time, but let's see if we can figure it out.
See if we could do like 10% more of that next week or 1% more and then just make that expand.
You can do that too by, you know, hypothetically at some point, if you're married, at some point you were in love with your wife.
You can remember that.
You have to remember that.
You have to practice remembering that.
You have to practice bringing it to mind and occupying that.
Because when you first fall in love, it kind of happens to you, right?
That's a gift.
But you have to, in order for that to last, you have to become an expert at, you have to become an expert at it.
You have to take it on as a responsibility.
It's offered as a gift, but then you have to take it on as a responsibility.
Then you have to practice.
It's like, oh, yes, I love this person.
And if you don't at the moment, you have to think, well, I did and I could.
So why don't I?
Is it me?
That's probably it's you.
Might be them too, but you might as well start with you.
I mean, you got lots of flaws.
You could start with those.
What if you just made a bad decision?
As in, like, the person you picked, you think they're not compatible?
Well, that's a tough one, eh?
Because you're not really compatible with anyone.
You know, people think, well, I'll find the right person.
It's like, first of all, no, you won't.
Second, if you found the right person and they ever saw you, they'd just run away screaming.
So it's just the whole conceptual scheme is wrong.
I, when I was on tour, there was one three-day period where the same question emerged from
the audience because I do a Q&A three nights in a row.
How do I find the person that's right for me?
And I tried answering it.
And by the third night, I thought, oh, I know why I can't answer this question.
It's because it's a stupid question.
It's badly formulated, like profoundly badly formulated, fatally badly formulated.
It's not the right question.
The right question is, how could I learn to offer something to someone else that would
make me eminently desirable?
That's a way different question.
Like, it's a way, they're not even in the same conceptual universe.
And it's the right question because you can build yourself into a person that people would
line up to be with.
How?
Well, have you done it?
Well, you're very successful, right?
You're increasingly successful.
Your book warns against narcissism, Jordan.
There's a difference between narcissism and giving the devil is due.
You've, okay, let's pull back a little bit.
What have you done right?
I have focused on myself for a long time.
Okay, what does that mean?
It means I fortified myself financially.
Okay.
So that I'm, you know, I can support others.
I can support family.
So that's not exactly focusing on yourself, right?
Okay.
That's focusing on getting your act together.
And I'm being very picky about the words because focus on yourself, that has a narcissistic
connotation.
But that isn't what you're talking about.
You said you fortified yourself financially.
Okay.
So now you have foundation under your feet financially.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, good.
What else?
I go to the gym.
So I'm strong, physically strong.
Okay.
Which is useful.
I've learned a lot.
Okay.
I've done a lot of learning about myself, about how I show up in the world.
Right.
So you're trying to learn.
Yes.
I've learned some skills.
Well, so there's three things that are pretty good.
Yeah.
You've got a firm financial foundation.
You've, your work, you're maintaining yourself physically or even improving yourself and you're
doing the same thing, say, spiritually and intellectually.
Okay.
Well, that'll attract a fair number of people.
Just those three.
Right.
And maybe you're increasing the probability that it will attract the sort of person that
you would like to attract.
That is very much the story of my life.
Like, I think, don't think people realize this, but I've actually been on, I think, four
dates in my entire life.
I'm 32.
And I took this really counter sort of seems counterintuitive approach to myself, which
was as an 18 year old, I basically couldn't attract anybody.
Yeah.
I was also not on dating apps.
I wasn't doing particular.
So my, for 10 years, I basically focused on myself and, you know, 27 years old, someone messaged me and I went on it.
And this is how I am.
Like, if I'm going to go on a date, it's going to be, I'm going to go all in.
It was a three day date that I planned in an Excel document.
I've been with that person for six years.
So I feel like I didn't date.
I didn't go to bars and try and like, you know, that's worth taking apart.
I like, I liked to do arithmetic with my clients.
Like people hate arithmetic and it's no wonder because it's so savage.
So I'll give you an example.
So 15 years ago, I counted the number of times I would see my parents.
It's like 20 times.
So then I knew that.
20 isn't very many, right?
How many people do you get to try on in your life?
Five.
If you're lucky, if you're attractive and fortunate, you get five cracks at the pinata.
Five isn't very many.
And people think, well, it's a, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
It's like, that doesn't mean they're going to swarm around you, buddy.
Right?
It's, and maybe it's even worse for women because their timeframe is, is very short.
You know, like if a woman isn't in a relationship, family relationship by 30, then it's starting to get pretty damn rough.
And that's almost independent of how attractive she is.
It's like, you don't have much time.
Better get yourself prepared.
When you say pretty damn rough, what do you mean?
Well.
To find a mate or to have a child?
Both.
Both.
Well, we know now that at the present time in the West, half of women, 30 and younger, don't have a child.
Now we also know that couples 30, one in three couples at 30 already have trouble conceiving.
And that definition of trouble is one year of attempt with no success.
Okay.
So, fertility goes off a cliff at 35.
So, 30, you're pushing your luck at 30.
At 35, you are seriously pushing your luck.
I worked for 10 years with a strata of the highest achieving women likely in Canada.
I had, as part of my clinical practice, an offering that we made to consulting firms and law firms.
And the offer was, send us your best people and we'll work for them.
But the consequence of that is that they'll be even more productive.
So, in the typical law firm, for example, there's people who don't do well.
Then there's people who are good lawyers.
Then there are people who are good lawyers that bring in business.
There's, like, none of them.
They're super valuable.
And if a law firm has someone like that, they want to keep them.
And they're often women, half the time, let's say.
And those were the women.
I worked with a bunch of men, too, but I'll concentrate on the women here.
Those were the women I was working with.
And they were generally extremely attractive, extremely intelligent, very hardworking,
and very focused on career development.
And they were, they'd done very well in junior high school and high school.
Then they, you know, aced college and their LSATs.
And then when they were articling, the firm snapped them up quickly.
And then they rocketed up towards partnership.
And then they were 30.
And they all thought, what the hell am I doing working 70 hours a week with a bunch of insanely competitive men?
Right.
And that is the question.
It's like, what are you doing?
Exactly.
And then even if you're radically successful, let's say, in your law school career,
if you get run over by a bus on the way to work, the waters just close over you at the firm, and the firm continues on.
It's not like anyone cares.
Not really.
So, now, I'm not saying that people shouldn't pursue a career.
I'm not saying that.
But I would say, even in my case, and I'm male, so that makes a big difference,
because men are also oriented towards status, competition, victory, in a way that women just aren't,
at least not in the career domain.
And the reason for that is very straightforward.
And the thing that makes men, by default, most attractive to women is their comparative success in the hierarchy of men.
It's a walloping predictor.
And it's irrelevant to men.
Like, men don't care at all whether women are successful in their career.
It's not a determinant of their attractiveness.
In fact, it's often the contrary.
Well, these women that I'm talking about, they were often alone.
Why?
Well, they're beautiful.
So, that, like, intimidated 90% of men right there.
They're smart.
So, that's another 90% of the remaining 10%.
They're accomplished and wealthy.
Well, like, first of all, who's going to approach them?
And second, who are they going to accept?
Because women are hypergamous, right?
Does that mean that men are insecure and sort of emasculated by a strong, successful woman?
Sure.
Yeah, well, but there's reason for that.
Like, it's not weakness on the part of men, exactly.
It's the desire of the woman to find someone who brings a benefit to the relationship.
And why?
Well, she, because a woman will make herself vulnerable when she has a child.
And so, she's looking for a man who'll be helpful compared to her.
Okay, so if the woman is, like, full of ability, well, then her standards for a guy who's going to be helpful get very high.
And that's hard on her because it decreases the pool of available candidates radically.
So, like, there's a negative relationship between IQ and women and the probability of being married.
So, it's harsh.
Now, is it, are men intimidated?
Well, yes, obviously.
Are men intimidated by beautiful women?
Well, you can answer that, especially if you're young.
Why?
The probability that any given beautiful woman is going to reject you when you're a young man is, like, it's basically 100%.
Now, it's not exactly 100%, and there are exceptions, but the default response is rejection.
And beautiful women get hit on, you know, a fair bit.
Some of the, it's interesting because there's a bunch of stats which I find quite interesting.
One of them is that sexlessness is increasing.
Yeah, yeah.
People are having less and less sex.
Yeah, that's fascinating.
That's fascinating.
Does it matter?
Oh, it's a catastrophe.
And why are we having less sex?
What is the complex web of factors that have brought us to this place?
And also, I mean, like, different strengths.
Well, one of them I would say is that in a free and easy mating environment, women don't trust men.
And no wonder.
And no wonder.
Well, here's a terrible thing to know.
So, imagine that there are men who are oriented towards short-term relationships, and there are men who are oriented towards long-term relationships, committed relationships, right?
Okay, so that would be the men who want love along with sex, let's say, love and commitment.
Then there's the party today because we're all dead tomorrow sort of guys.
And there's some women like that, too, although fewer women because they pay a much higher price for sexual impropriety.
So, the pool of short-term maters has more men in it.
Okay, what do they like?
Well, the personality studies have already been done.
They're Machiavellian, which means they use their language to manipulate.
They're narcissistic, which means they want unearned social status.
They're psychopathic, which makes them predatory parasites.
And they're sadistic.
Okay, so now you open up the mating market so that short-term dalliances are acceptable.
You throw all the women into the hands of the psychopaths.
Well, that's a bad strategy.
And it's no wonder that it decimates the mating market because women are thinking, well, are those men trustworthy?
And the answer is no.
And sex is costly.
Like, we have this immature delusion that we can free sex from, like, the grip of the oppressive patriarchy, let's say.
It's like, no, you can't.
Obviously, you can't.
Like, emotional entanglements are an inevitable consequence of intimate physical relationships.
There's that.
Then there's the issue of abortion and pregnancy.
That actually constitutes a problem.
And then there's sexually transmitted disease.
And that's just, like, the first of a very long list of potential problems with sex.
So there's no simple sexual landscape.
And there are deluded people who think there is a simple landscape and that there should be.
But most, they tilt hard in the psychopathic direction because they're manipulative.
Do you believe in no sex before marriage as a concept?
As an ideal, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
And why would that result in better relationships and a better society more broadly?
Well, here's one way of looking at it.
So let's say you take the alternative approach, okay?
You're going to try your partner on for size.
So you live together.
Well, first of all, we know that couples who live together are more likely to get divorced rather than less.
We know that the probability of cheating is proportionate to the number of partners before the marriage or the committed relationship.
Well, partly that's just self-evidence.
Like, the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
Right.
So if you had a lot of partners, you're the sort of person who's likely to have a lot of partners.
And then there's also a conceptual problem.
It's like, are you shopping for a car?
It's like, are you going to take it out for a test drive and see how it goes?
Okay, that's not the right metaphor.
And then here's another problem.
I'm going to see what it's like to be married by living with this person.
It's like, no, you're not.
Because you don't know what it's like to be married until you're married.
Whatever you're doing when you live together, that's not a model for what you're going to do when you're married.
Because being married is different.
It's permanent.
So you're saying don't live together before you...
Well, I know the stats on living together.
It's like you live with someone and then you marry them.
You're more likely to get divorced.
So it doesn't work.
Like, the theory was you try it out and if it works, you go ahead with it.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, the theory was wrong because that isn't what happens.
It actually increases the probability that the relationship will fail.
It's also partly, you've got to ask yourself what the message is.
I know what the message is when you live with someone.
It's pretty straightforward.
You'll do unless someone better comes along and I'll grant you the same opportunity.
But Jesus, that's a hell of a foundation for a long-term relationship.
So you're saying go from single to married and living together straight away without the,
like, try-on period?
Well, I don't know exactly what the trial period should be.
I mean, people have dated.
And I'm also not saying that this is simple.
It's not simple.
Why would it be simple?
It's not, there isn't anything more difficult that you do in your entire life than find a
partner and establish a family.
It's like, it's going to be hard.
How to do it optimally?
Well, I can tell you in my own experience, you know, like I've known my wife since she was
eight and we were friends, good friends.
And we kind of departed from each other during adolescence.
I was a year younger than everyone in my class and she matured faster.
Women do anyways.
And so that kind of split us apart and we didn't get married till I think we were about 27,
something like that, 28.
But it would have been better to do it earlier.
To get married earlier?
Yeah.
It's just time I didn't have with her.
What case would you make to me for marriage?
Versus, because I'm, I'll be honest, I'm wrestling with marriage, not just God.
I'm trying to understand what the point of marriage is versus the relationship we have
now.
But I can have children in the relationship I have now.
Yeah.
The general rule of thumb for life is that you should do what other people have done forever
unless you have a really good reason not to.
Don't deviate from the straight, narrow path.
Like you are already deviating in all sorts of ways.
You're very entrepreneurial, right?
So your life has a variety of adventurous pathways.
You're going to want to put firm foundation wherever you can.
That'll actually free you up to do more adventurous things.
Children are a multi-generational commitment.
Because it's children and grandchildren.
And so the marriage is a signifier of that.
And in order to stay with someone optimally over the longest period of time possible, it
has to be serious.
And for something to be serious, you have to throw everything at it.
You know, and you might say, well, love is enough.
It's like, that's a very naive view of the world because there'll be times, because that's
kind of like saying, well, as long as we love each other and we're happy, we'll be together.
It's like, well, if you're talking 40 years, there's going to be plenty of years in there
where you're not happy and you probably don't love each other.
So what then?
You're going to just, is it just going to dissolve?
Or are you going to say, we're in this, you know, come hell or high water, which is the
vow, come hell or high, and hell and high water, they're coming.
And then you got to ask yourself, you know, is this the person you want in the boat with
you when hell and high water come?
And that's not going to be fun.
That's for sure.
You want to do it alone?
Or you think that when everything falls apart around you, you're going to be in a better
position to find someone better?
I don't think so.
It's a long, and then, you know, you take the marital vow in a religious sense and you
do it in front of a community, right?
So it signifies commitment.
And you need that because, like, you think you can maintain all that commitment on your
own?
Maybe you can.
I doubt it.
Generally, people can't, like no one.
We need to fortify ourselves in all sorts of ways to get through the things in life that
are most difficult.
But the traditional marriage agreement, one that's a legal agreement, does it need to
be, can I not take my partner, have a wedding in front of our friends and family, sign a
contract, maybe even do it in a sort of religious context without having it to be like a legal
document that the government are involved in?
Well, you could, but...
Is it not the same bond to you?
There, you're talking about a multitude of different bonds, right?
Fundamentally, right?
You're, the one that you're prioritizing is the bond that's voluntary and predicated on
what?
The love of the moment?
I mean, we want to be precise here, right?
And that, so I think that's a reasonably, reasonable way of conceptualizing it.
And it is a romantic view that that should prevail, and it's a romantic view that that
should be sufficient.
I don't think it, there's, it's often the case that it doesn't prevail, and it's generally
the case that it's not sufficient.
And so then you might say, well, maybe you want to add a legal element to that, and you
want to add a metaphysical element to it, because those are all fortifications.
And there are indications even to yourself that you're serious.
It's not like we understand ourselves, you know, like people are just as mysterious to
themselves as someone else is mysterious to them.
You ask yourself, it's like, okay, well, what processes, what do I have to put in place
to ensure that I'm doing the right thing?
Well, when you're embarking on something difficult, like marriage, and you better have
everything necessary in place.
If you and Tammy hadn't got married, and you were just in a relationship like I am with
my partner, how would you think your life would be different?
And do you think...
I don't think it would have lasted.
You don't think your life would have lasted?
Oh, well, no, that's, that's undoubtedly true.
I mean, both of us just about died in the last five years, and I don't mean by a little
bit.
I mean, like, it was touch and go for a long time.
So, it was a good thing everything was in place through that.
I mean, the waters were pretty high for the last three years, four years, socially, professionally,
physically.
What are you wrestling with exactly, like, in this issue?
You know, I mean, it seems like you're trying to sort out the relationship between the emotional
attachment and the personal attachment and the social structures that, say, surround marriage.
It's complicated, because even any answer I might give you is, if you go down that spiral,
you might find something at the bottom of it.
That's not what I'm saying.
So, what I mean by that is...
Oh, definitely.
Just as you asked that question, I just got a glimpse of, I just had a bit of a flash
to, like, my issues with commitment and how I watched...
Okay, so what, you had a little fantasy?
No, I just, I just remember recalling feeling like my dad was in prison when he was in his
relationship.
So, I think that's still part of me.
Okay, so now I can tell you what to do with that.
So, you bring those images to mind, right?
So, you've got this question in mind.
You just found out something.
You said that there's something at the bottom of this.
Okay, now, if you watch your fantasies, they all shed light on this descent into the abyss,
so to speak.
Now, you had a flash of memory.
Okay, that memory is associated with all sorts of things.
Now, you can bring that to mind and let it play itself out, right?
And it'll explore the contours of the problem that you're...
Now, you put your finger on a very important problem.
You said that you saw in your father someone who's trapped in his marriage.
Yeah.
Well, it's no bloody wonder you're leery of that, right?
So, now you...
Okay, so now the question would be, what was the nature of that entrapment?
What evidence did you have that that was, in fact, the case?
How much of that was him?
How much of that was her?
And what is it that they did wrong and right?
You need to know all of that, and you need to know how it affected you.
That's a great observation.
See, that's so cool, because that very frequently happens to people
when they ask a question.
That's like a revelation.
So, you ask a question.
That's like a prayer.
The question is, is there something at the bottom of my...
the trouble I'm having conceptualizing marriage?
Okay, now you want to know.
That's the first precondition.
Okay, then you'll get memories, images like that.
And then people shy away.
It's like, I don't want to go there.
It's like, yeah, that's for sure.
You bloody well don't want to go there.
But you do, because if it's there, you will go there, right?
It'll plague you.
It'll plague your life.
It'll show its head continually in your relationship.
Or you can get to the bottom of it, which is...
People will fight their whole life with their partner
to avoid getting to the bottom of something.
That's how terrifying it is to get to the bottom of something, right?
But if you do get to the bottom of it,
then you don't have to fight for 30 years.
So that's very much worthwhile.
And it'll lighten you as well.
You know, because you have a real issue.
It's like, how can marriage not be a trap?
Yeah.
Well, yeah, right.
Definitely.
That's a very good question.
And an important one.
How can marriage be a trap?
How can not being married be a trap?
How can being alone be a trap?
How can being deluded about what holds people together be a trap?
There's traps everywhere, man.
There's traps everywhere.
And so there's no risk-free pathway forward.
There's just risk everywhere.
Okay, so that's a really useful thing to know.
So then the question would shift to something like,
well, if I wanted to construct a relationship that was optimized,
that's what you have to ask yourself.
It's like, and your partner.
It's like, what are we doing here?
What do we want?
Tammy and I decided, for example, when we first got married,
well, I mentioned this to her right away
when we decided that we were going to take things seriously.
It was like, we're going to tell each other the truth.
So that was part of the vision.
Like, no matter what.
No matter what.
Yeah, no matter what.
She's been very good at that.
I would say better than me.
I've been good at it,
but she's been really quite remarkably good at it.
She really threw herself into it.
And I mean, that causes a complete transformation,
but there's plenty of skeletons in the closet to be revealed.
Oh, God, that's for sure.
Talking of things that risk harming relationships,
one of the things I wanted to ask you about,
a subject we've never spoke about before,
but it ties into the themes of relationships,
marriage, and sex, is pornography.
And generally...
Oh, another reason that sex has disappeared.
Yeah.
Right, right.
You talk about hedonism in your book,
We Who Wrestle With God.
Pornography, is this a bad thing?
It's a terrible thing.
Yeah, it's a terrible thing.
Everything about it is terrible.
Really?
Well, first of all, it's addictive.
And no wonder.
I mean, any 13-year-old boy
can now look at more beautiful,
naked women in one day
than the greatest king who ever lived
managed in his whole life.
Right.
So it's like, wow, that's not...
And talk me through the downstream consequences
of such a possibility.
It's easy.
It's easy.
It's easy to get what?
Sexual gratification.
That's not good.
It's not supposed to be easy.
And it's easy.
So, how desperate do you have to be
to get married?
Not desperate at all.
It's like, yeah, right.
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
I'm married just because I'm in love.
You're an idiot.
God, to put you in a position
where you're going to have
the romantic adventure of your life,
the true romantic adventure of your life,
you're going to need love and desperation, buddy.
You're going to need everything
working on your side.
Love, desperation, terror, shame, guilt,
everything working for you.
And so you take the easy road.
Pornography.
Sure.
You're not desperate anymore.
So people that consume pornography,
do you think they're less motivated
to attack life and to...
Well, they're definitely less motivated
to pursue sexual relationships with women.
By way of that,
are they then less likely
to then want to go to the gym
or have a career?
Oh, definitely.
It's an interesting idea.
How much of what men do
do they do to impress women?
A lot.
Yeah, like all of it.
All of it.
I mean, the status battles
that men back to the law firms,
for example.
So the men I worked with,
they're very concerned
with their bonuses
and their, you know,
their end-of-the-year
performance reports.
Why?
Well, part of it was the money.
Most of them had lots of money.
It's like I'd ask them,
they say,
well, that's...
The money is how we keep score.
Well, what does that mean?
Well, it's...
Money is the way that men
in those competitive enterprises
say they compare themselves
to one another.
And why do they want
to be at the top?
Because women peel from the top.
So men are trying to impress women
all the time
and they'll do it
in positive ways
and in pathological ways.
The window for sexual representation
started to open
in the 1920s, let's say,
but it really got going
with Playboy.
Then Penthouse came out
right after that.
And Penthouse was like
full frontal nudity display.
And then Hustler came out
and Hustler was sort of,
well, whatever Penthouse
didn't show you,
Hustler will show you.
And it got pretty lowbrow,
like it was a rough,
low-class magazine.
It didn't...
It just shed all the pretensions
that Playboy and Penthouse had.
And then the net came along.
It's like...
All those engineers
who couldn't establish
a relationship
with an actual woman
exchanging pornography.
What, 25% of internet traffic?
Something like that?
That desire to exchange
pornography?
Was that what created
the net?
Yeah.
It was a huge part of it.
What's that done?
Well, as you pointed out,
I think 30% now
of Japanese men and women
under 30 are virgins.
It's about the same in Korea.
Relationships between men
and women are falling apart
in the rest of the West
in the same sort of way.
Now, can you attribute
that to pornography?
Certainly part.
Like, if I was a young woman
and I was looking
at the pornography world online,
I'd think,
yeah, maybe not.
One of the interesting things
we noticed
when we were doing
some research on this
was what the top Google search
around this subject matter
is, how do I quit?
And I feel like the third one
is, how do I quit?
And it's in such high quantity
of people searching Google
for how to quit pornography
that it feels desperate.
Like, it feels desperate.
Well, why wouldn't it be addictive?
And why doesn't pornography
feel good to people?
That's a good question.
That's a good question.
Well, there's nothing heroic
about it, that's for sure.
It's like,
it's obviously nothing
to be proud of.
That's a different issue
than whether or not
it's wrong, right?
It's certainly not
an accomplishment.
I mean, I don't think
anyone would disagree
about that.
It's not an accomplishment.
Well, maybe sex
is supposed to be
an accomplishment.
Maybe you violate
the spirit of sexuality itself
when it's not an accomplishment.
You certainly do that
if you rape, right?
So is it an accomplishment?
Probably.
So what if your accomplishment
is false?
Well, then what are you
betraying?
Well, if it's associated
with sex,
maybe you're betraying
the most fundamental
possible thing.
It's certainly possible.
Like, there's life and sex.
That's pretty much that, right?
You're alive and you reproduce
from a biological perspective.
And so you're violating
the spirit of what?
Maybe you're violating
the spirit of relationship.
Maybe you're violating
the spirit of adventure,
the spirit of romance.
The spirit of reproduction,
the spirit of life.
Likely.
It's so interesting
that people seem to be,
a lot of people
seem to be angry at it.
They seem to be angry
with what it's done to them.
They should be angry.
They should be angry.
Even on an individual level,
people seem,
in the comment section
of these episodes
that we've done
about the subject matter,
people seem to be angry
about its existence
and what it's done to them.
They should be angry.
They should be outraged.
It's outrageous.
It's outrageous.
Would you ban it
if you were in charge
of the world?
I don't know
how to answer that.
I think any policy that,
policies that require force
rather than voluntary compliance
are generally bad policies.
There are restrictions
that should be placed
on its distribution,
but I would have to spend
a lot of time
thinking through
what those were
from a policy perspective.
I think it's wrong.
No, I don't think.
I know it's wrong.
That doesn't mean I know
how that should be dealt
with at the level of policy.
It's complicated.
I do understand
why young men
and young women
are angry about it.
It's like,
where are the adults?
Where are the adults?
Where have they gone?
They're not protecting
like 11-year-old kids
from what you can see
on the net.
You know,
I remember when I was a kid,
I got a hold of some
of these underground comics
from the 1960s,
and a lot of the underground
comic artists were,
they're pretty pathological
creatures,
like Robert Crumb's
a good example.
Crumb led a pretty good life
for someone as demented
as he is.
And there's a very famous
documentary made
about the Crumb brothers,
and Robert Crumb
was the establisher.
He was one of the people
who established
the genre
of graphic novel,
really,
back in the 60s
in Hyde Ashbury
in San Francisco.
And his imagination
goes places
that you don't want to,
you don't want to be
along for the ride.
Seriously.
Like, seriously.
And I read some of that material
when I was like 11,
you know,
I never forgot it.
It was shocking as hell.
And like,
typical 11-year-old now,
it's like,
there are things
that he is going to see
that he'll never forget.
It's not good.
And the brain
is still forming
at that age,
isn't it?
So it's...
Oh, definitely.
It's an interesting way
to shock the brain.
Well, we also don't know.
That's right.
We have no idea
whatsoever
what a diet
of pornography exposure
does to somebody
who's, you know,
making their way
through puberty.
What would you say
to those individuals
then that have been
Googling that,
like, how to quit?
Because I imagine
if we thought about percentages,
I'd say,
what, 90% of people
that are listening right now
watch pornography?
At least,
I don't know
what the numbers are,
but it's a lot of people.
It's the vast majority.
Write down what it's doing to you.
Write down what it's doing to you.
Write down exhaustively.
Everything you think
it might be doing to you.
Write it down.
Everything.
Don't worry about
whether you're right or not.
Like,
maybe it's not doing
some of the things
you think it might be doing,
but make an exhaustive list.
Then start thinking through.
It's like,
is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
And then write down
what you want instead.
That'll help
because if you're going to,
look,
any hedonistic endeavor
is rewarding in the moment,
obviously.
The problem is,
is the price you pay for it
in the medium to long run,
right?
That's the problem.
And it's the contradiction
between those two things
that's the problem.
Okay,
now if you want to quit
doing something
that's gratifying
in the short term,
you need to know why,
right?
Because otherwise
you won't have the willpower.
You won't have the
the part of you
that thinks,
well,
what the hell
will win.
What the hell?
Which is what people think
when they do something
they shouldn't do.
And they should notice
what they say to themselves
when they're making
that rationalization
because what the hell
refers to hell.
and the reason to stop
doing things
that are self-destructive
is because
they're self-destructive.
I mean,
is that the sort of person
you want to be?
Is that the model
you'd like to have
for your son,
for example?
Is that
the way
you would imagine
that someone you admire
would act?
These are good questions
to ask yourself.
No.
Are you this sort of person
that is acting out
a pattern that you think
is admirable?
I don't think pornography
masturbation fits into
the ideal of heroic masculinity.
I don't think anybody
thinks that.
It's,
there's something furtive
about it
and second rate.
Obviously,
like,
it's ridiculous in a sense
that we even have to have
this discussion
because obviously.
Well,
these things creep in,
don't they,
to society
and they become normal.
That's for sure.
First they creep,
then they rampage.
We almost can't remember
a time,
if you're a young person,
when there wasn't
pornography.
You definitely can't remember
a time.
You open up an app
and you get a lot of time.
Absolutely.
A hundred percent.
Oh,
and it's going to get way worse.
Wait till there are
AI equipped,
adjustable pornographic
suck you by.
Then we're really
going to have fun
because we're already
at the point now
where with a decent
chatbot,
a really alienated
young man
can have a better
conversation
with a decent
chatbot
than with anybody
he's ever talked to
in his entire life.
Right.
Now they're going
to get a lot smarter
and soon they're
going to have
like,
well,
you can,
there's already
services of this
sort available.
They'll be fully
fleshed out
two-dimensional women.
They're not women.
Simulacra of women.
Right.
So,
yeah.
It's interesting
because with my head
and it's,
design your own
girlfriend.
She won't argue
with you.
She won't do the
90 minutes a week.
Yeah,
right.
Right.
She'll give you
everything you want
but that's not true.
She'll give the worst
part of you
everything it wants.
Jesus,
that's not good.
The worst,
weakest part of you
will get exactly
what it wants.
That's not good.
That's seriously
not good.
I mean,
that's what pornography
is kind of doing,
right?
Definitely.
Yeah.
Well,
and there's an edge
to it too,
right?
Because one of the,
pleasure is enhanced
by novelty.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
So,
so that,
that brings up
an issue
with regards
to marriage.
You know,
I talked to Bill Maher.
Bill's alone
and he's my age,
you know,
and that's painful
but he said to me,
you know,
in his Hollywood
hedonistic manner
that he really
couldn't imagine
being with the same woman,
you know,
for any length of time.
It's a novelty issue.
It's like,
well,
are you restricted
by the woman
or are you restricted
by the limits
of your own imagination?
This is an important question.
Like,
I would say
if you establish
the optimized relationship
with someone,
you,
they're inexhaustible.
That doesn't mean
novelty isn't important.
It's important.
That's part of play.
So,
yeah,
a lot of people
struggle with that.
Got a lot of friends
that struggle
with this idea
of being with
the same person forever.
The same person.
That's the problem.
Well,
but that's really,
no,
look,
I understand.
Like,
I know that novelty
enhances pleasure.
So,
the question is,
how do you
keep your relationship
alive?
That means novel.
You play.
It's interesting
because actually,
what I actually think
is happening there
is it's not
that they
are miserable
with the same person forever.
It's actually
the thought.
That's kind of what I said,
the thought of being
with the same person.
Well, that's part of that trap,
eh?
Yeah.
Well, okay,
so that's a very good observation
because,
see,
because that thought
is going to have
a story attached to it.
The story's going to be
something like,
well,
I'm with this person.
We both become unattractive
quite rapidly.
We get alienated
from one another.
There's no sexual dynamism
or romance
or excitement
and then we just sit,
you know,
and eat,
like,
cold eggs
while looking at each other
harshly over the table
at breakfast
for 40 years.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
that's dismal.
So,
you know,
maybe don't do that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
there's an element
of control to it.
On this point of hedonism
as well,
I was thinking,
because we're still
talking about pornography,
but there's many types
of hedonism in my life,
whether it's,
you know,
eating the cookie,
this is a,
I don't actually do this,
but it's a metaphor
of eating the cookie
from the minibar
in my hotel room
here in New York
at 1 a.m. in the morning
when I know tomorrow
I'm going to regret it.
There's all these forms
of hedonism,
like scrolling on TikTok
or whatever it might be.
And hedonism shows up
in my life
in these little uncontrolled,
like,
oh, gosh,
fuck,
I made a mistake.
Of course.
And it sometimes shows up
when I'm
distabled in some way,
emotionally distabled.
Sure, yeah.
And so it's almost,
it feels like
it's a form of medicine.
Now,
I could write down
on this page
who I want to be.
I could say,
I don't want to be the person
that eats the cookie.
I don't want to be on TikTok.
I don't want to watch pornography,
all those kinds of things.
But then staving off
that moment
where, you know,
you're weakened in some way.
And I use that word,
maybe it's,
you're weakened in some way
by something,
tired or whatever.
Yeah.
Sticking to those principles
when in that moment,
when it's hard,
is that just,
again,
a case of just being clear
on what I want in the long term?
Well, that helps.
It helps.
Practice helps.
Surrounding yourself
with people
who have the same aim
and that keep you
responsible,
accountable,
that helps.
Oh, yeah,
you need all of that
because that battle,
the battle between
immediate gratification
and medium
to long-term investment,
that's a real battle.
You know,
like the right amount
of pleasure in the moment
isn't zero.
Yeah,
I just want to live
a life of misery.
Well, right, right.
And you can't,
you don't want to be
the joyless grind
for whom everything
is tomorrow.
Yeah.
Right?
It's very hard to,
because what you're trying
to do is you're trying
to optimize emotion
and strategy
over all time frames.
And you don't know
how long that time frame is.
Well, that's also a problem.
Exactly, exactly.
If I might have one day left,
God.
Right.
So I don't need to think so.
Well, and we also know,
you know,
when people are, say,
off to a battle
in wartime,
they party like
there's no tomorrow.
Well,
because maybe there isn't.
So definitely,
the religious insistence
is that you should live
in the light of eternity.
Right?
Is that you should
attempt to conduct yourself
in a manner
that is best
all things considered
over the longest
possible conceivable
span of time.
Now...
Does that mean
don't have the dessert?
No.
No, because...
No, it doesn't mean that.
Because, look,
in the biblical text,
for example,
there is an insistence
that the spirit
of the divine
wants the provision
of life more abundant.
That's the language.
The idea of a fruitful garden,
an earthly garden
of delights even,
that's part and parcel
of a vision of paradise.
It's not joyless.
It's harmoniously balanced.
I think the best way
to think about it
is likely musically.
You know,
in a musical piece
that's great,
every note has its place.
Every note has its proper place
in relationship
to the whole.
Right?
But every note
is also worthwhile.
Well, that's what you want,
is you want to balance
your concentration
on the present
with your apprehension
of the medium to long run.
So, I'll give you
an example of that.
So, I did a course
for Peterson Academy
called...
It's on the Sermon on the Mount.
And the Sermon on the Mount
is the longest record
we have of Christ's
direct utterances,
let's say.
And it constitutes
the core of Christian ethics.
It's a set of instructions,
and the instructions
are very specific.
So, essentially,
the instruction is
to aim at every moment
at what's highest.
Okay?
So, this is something
you have to practice.
Okay?
So, the idea is that
at each moment
you're bringing to bear
a certain attitude,
and the attitude is
I'm going to do
what's best.
Okay?
For you.
All things considered
for me now,
for me now
in a way
that works tomorrow,
for me now
in a way
that works tomorrow
and next week
and next month
and next year
and five years from now
and ten years from now
in relationship
to my wife,
in relationship
to my kids,
to my parents,
to my community.
Right?
It's that whole identity.
You're optimizing that.
Now, you might not know how,
but that's your aim.
Okay?
So, that's the injunction
to put the love of God
above all else,
to aim at what's highest.
Now, you don't exactly
know how to do that,
but that doesn't matter.
You can specify your aim.
Right?
Now, no doubt
you do something like that
with your podcast.
Right?
That's why it's successful.
Yeah.
Okay, you agree with that.
Yeah.
Why?
Because it's difficult, isn't it?
There's just immense pressure
when you're a podcaster
to aim at something else.
And you have to,
me and Jack talk about this a lot,
you have to have like
a certain set of principles
that are unnegotiable.
But whatever principles
you choose and believe in,
they come at a great cost.
Okay, what are the principles?
So...
See, this is worth delving into
because you've been very successful
as a podcaster.
One of my principles is
I will,
I try not to judge
the people I'm speaking to.
And I try not to come in
with preconceptions.
I take them as I meet them.
I try not to...
I'm in search of
genuine curiosity
in them
or some kind of answer
or truth.
Right, so there's a search in it.
Yeah, it's a search.
Well, that's a quest.
So, you know what?
An adventure story is a quest.
Can I answer that question?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's only one thing
I would take issue with.
You said that you don't judge.
See, I would say
probably you don't condemn.
You have to judge
because you have to listen
and you have to separate
wheat from chaff.
You have to evaluate.
But you can do that
without careless condemnation
or a priori,
what would you say,
like a tyrannical insistence
that what you know now
is sufficient.
Okay, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
You want to not...
People say,
I'm not judgmental.
It's like,
that's not a virtue.
You want to be...
You want to use judgment
all the time.
But that's...
Yeah.
Like, I could judge you
so I don't ever have to listen
to you about anything.
Yeah, judgment might happen
in my head,
but it's then about
how I treat the person
based on that judgment.
I don't want to treat them based...
I don't want to have some,
like, higher
egotistical values
that I'm correct.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's right.
That's exactly it.
You're right.
That's a hypocritical moralizing.
It's the moralizing.
It's like,
I think I'm better than you
because I'm not.
That's exactly...
Exactly.
That's right.
You don't want to...
You definitely don't want
to do that in a podcast.
Journalists,
the pathological journalists,
that's all they do.
All they're doing
is establishing moral superiority
on the flimsiest possible grounds,
at the least possible cost,
in the most spectacular way.
Yeah, it's really not good.
It's hard being a podcaster,
especially in this particular moment
where there's been such a
focus on podcasting
because of what's happened
in this election cycle.
Yeah.
You really have to be clear
on what you believe in
because the winds are going to blow.
Like, the world is going
to try and sway you.
They're going to say,
you can't speak to this person.
You have to speak to this person.
Don't do that.
Don't do this.
This is wrong.
And you go,
okay, so how do I weather
such a storm
when I know the storm is coming?
I don't have to look to Rogan
to go,
look at what,
you know,
Rogan,
the arc of Rogan.
And if I'm also a podcaster...
Just keep asking stupid questions.
Yeah.
Yeah, well,
that is that quest.
And what people want
in a discussion is a quest.
They want to see
bloodhounds on the trail
towards some truth.
That's what they're after.
They want to participate in that.
Same with the public lectures I do.
I'm always trying
to answer a question.
I don't know what the answer is
when I go on stage.
It's a real question.
Do you think Joe has...
Joe Rogan...
I've never actually met him,
but do you think he just has
great faith in humans?
And there...
Because there's obviously
been a lot of pressure on him.
So how he survived that
is he just has faith in
who he is.
He has faith in his own ignorance.
Okay.
And that those watching,
which is a lot of people
watching Rogan will understand.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Joe's on a quest.
He's trying to be smarter than he is.
That's what Joe does.
It's curiosity that's driving him.
This is what Musk said, too,
about himself.
And he said that to me
when I interviewed him.
He said that was how he reconciled.
He had a terrible existential crisis
when he was like 13,
you know,
and he reconciled that
essentially with the quest.
He decided that
he could just pursue truth,
pursue knowledge,
pursue understanding,
and that that would...
That's meaningful intrinsically
and valuable intrinsically.
And that's the beginnings
of a religious orientation,
or more than the beginnings even,
because the quest
is a religious pursuit.
It's pursuit of the truth.
It's pursuit of the treasure
that the dragon guards, right?
And so treasures and dragons,
they're always in the same place.
It's very annoying.
It's a good thing to know, though,
because if a dragon shows up,
you can always ask yourself
where the treasure is.
Might be close.
It's there.
So, okay,
so back to the Sermon on the Mount,
because we were talking
about orientation.
So aim up.
Assume that other people
have the same value as you do,
and that that value is associated
with whatever is divine,
and then concentrate on the moment.
Right, so it's the most distant
possible upward aim
with the most intense
possible concentration
on the moment.
Right.
You're good at that.
That's what, that's,
I can't say that's
what's made you successful,
but it's certainly part of it,
because you pay attention.
See, that's what paying attention means,
because you want your,
your, your intent to be focused,
because otherwise your attention
is fragmented.
So you want your attention
to be focused.
Now, your attention
is focused on something.
Now, we pulled it apart
a little bit.
You said that you're,
you know,
you have these principles
and that you're trying to learn,
and so your attention
is pretty focused,
and then you bring all that
to bear in the moment.
Right, and then people
find that compelling,
because they're on,
they're along for the ride.
They're along for the adventure,
and that is meaningful.
It's the essence of meaningful.
And so, so what we were trying
to address was the relationship
between hedonism and,
and say, intelligent,
long-term, pro-social strategy.
You can, you want them both.
You want, you want,
there's an optimized solution
that delivers both
far better than any other solution.
This is the pearl of great price
that Christ speaks about,
that anyone wise and wealthy
would sell everything
they own to purchase.
There isn't anything
better than that.
For the, for the person
listening right now
that is struggling
with this concept of like,
we talked about hedonism,
discipline.
Yeah, yeah.
Like, they're just so far from it,
because there's a scale
of people that are,
you know, able to stay focused
on the long term.
For the people
at the very other end
of the scale
who just look at their lives
and go, I just,
I hear what he's saying.
For some reason,
it's not working.
Like, I can't get out
of this situation.
Yep.
You meet these people
all the time.
Well, maybe, maybe you can't
start on the porn side then,
you know, like my,
this is how a good behavior
analyst approaches problems
of that sort.
It's like, okay,
is there something in your life
that you know
that you know
is not right
that you could improve
that you would improve?
Any step whatsoever?
Well, generally,
you can just ask yourself
that question.
It's like,
it's a contemplative exercise.
Sit on the edge of your bed
and think, okay,
where is my life off kilter?
Is,
so then,
then you have
a variety of ideas
about how you're-
Yeah, okay, okay.
I'm on my mom's bed.
I'm in,
I've got no relationship.
My job's crap.
I hate it.
Okay, then I'd say,
zero in on one of those.
Yeah.
And find some small thing
that you could fix
that you would fix.
Why a small thing?
Well, because look at you,
you're completely goddamn useless.
You better find something small
that you could do.
Now, if you can find a big thing,
good,
but obviously you haven't been able to
because all these problems exist.
So, see,
one of the emphasis
in the religious realm,
let's say,
is humility.
One of the things
that's emphasized.
Well, what's humility?
What's the opposite of pride?
Well, humility is starting
where you are.
That's what humility is.
And it's annoying
because, you know,
like if your life is a mess,
then you have to see
that you're the person
in that mess.
And then you have to understand
that your first attempt
to redress the mess
might not be something
you're particularly proud of,
you know?
I mean,
I saw this lots
in my clinical practice
where people would,
the first steps
they had to take
to put things in order
were pretty embarrassing.
It's like,
really?
That's all I can do?
Hey, man,
uphill is better
than downhill.
And there's a doctrine
in the Gospels
that Christ puts forward,
which is very interesting.
He says,
it's the Matthew principle,
it's called,
to those who have everything,
more will be given.
From those who have nothing,
everything will be taken.
Okay,
so it lays out
a view of the world.
Progress,
regression.
That's one model.
Here's another one.
Progress,
progress,
progress,
regression.
This is the right model.
So even if you have
to start small,
you accrue success
exponentially.
You accrue defeat
exponentially, too.
That's the abyss
that is hell.
You start going downhill,
you go downhill
faster and faster.
You start going uphill,
you go uphill
faster and faster.
So even if you have
to start small
or even painfully small,
which is highly probable,
especially if you're
trying to tackle
something that's
really plagued you,
it doesn't really matter.
How small?
Take,
I would say,
take the step
that you can take,
that you will take,
that actually feels
like some accomplishment.
Imagine you're dealing
with a three-year-old kid
and you want to
encourage him.
Okay.
You want to set him
a task that,
you don't want him
to say,
Dad,
I could do that
when I was two.
Right?
But you don't want
to set him a task
that there's not
a chance he'll manage.
You want to set him
a task that will
stretch him beyond
where he is,
that has a reasonable
probability of success.
Right?
Why?
Why stretch him
from where he is?
Well,
because you want to grow.
I mean,
look,
if you love a child,
you love the child
for who he is
and who he could be.
And you want to
indicate your love
for both of those.
I think if you're a father,
you tilt even more
towards love
for who the child
could be.
What is self-belief
in this context?
Because people,
everyone's looking,
so many people
are in search of
two words.
I think that's
three words,
but self-belief
and confidence.
Yeah.
And in this context
of that small task,
how is that building
my self-belief
or confidence?
Yeah.
Well,
because you watch
yourself do it.
And that does what to me?
Well,
well,
look,
if you see someone,
a friend,
who is continually,
incrementally improving,
you're going to,
well,
maybe you'll be jealous
and resentful
and bitter and miserable
and try to undermine them.
But assuming you're not
like completely
encapsulated by dark forces,
you'll think,
oh,
that's admirable.
Well,
you see the same thing
in yourself.
You have to act.
You have to develop
an opinion of yourself
the same way
you would develop
an opinion of someone else.
So now,
and I'm not hypothesizing
about this,
by the way,
we know this clinically.
If I want to truly
help you build
your confidence
rather than merely
readjusting the words
you say about yourself,
which would be something
like self-esteem,
which is something
that doesn't even exist,
by the way,
it's just a pathological
concept altogether,
you want confidence.
Okay?
More to the point,
you want the confidence
that's based in competence.
Otherwise,
it's narcissistic.
Okay,
so how do you develop that?
Well,
you watch yourself
exceed your limits.
And then you think,
oh,
look at that.
There's something in me
that can exceed my limits.
That's your true self.
That's a good way
of thinking about it.
And in doing so,
you actually realize
that limits exist
and that you imposed
one on yourself
in the first place.
Well,
that's one of the things
you can realize,
certainly,
that also you don't
exactly know
where the limits are.
It's like,
oh,
I exceeded that.
It's like,
okay,
well,
now what?
What's the upward
limit to exceed?
What's the upward
arc of exceeding limits?
That's Jacob's ladder.
I would say
this is the promise
of the kingdom of God.
That's one way
of thinking about it.
There's no upward limit.
There's no limit
to how bad things can get.
No one would deny that
who has any sense.
So that means,
in a way,
that hell exists.
You can find your way there
with no problem.
In terms of energy,
there are so many reasons
why I'm a big matcha fan,
if you don't already know
by now.
And so much so
that I actually invested
in the UK's leading matcha
company called Perfect Ted.
And one of my favorite
Perfect Ted products
is these delicious
matcha pouches

from salted caramel
to peach flavor
to mint flavor
to berry flavor.
One of my favorites
is this vanilla flavor,
which I'm going to make
in just two seconds.
You just take this
mixer here,
get a little bit
of a powder,
pop it on top
of the shaker like that.
Put the lid on.
Shake, shake, shake.
Delicious.

It's interesting
what's going on
with young men
in particular
at the moment
because it does appear
and I don't have
the stats on this
in front of me,
but it does appear
that young men
are more and more
in search of
some type of religion.
Yeah, definitely.
I think Islam,
I think I read Islam
is on the rise
amongst young men
or it's the dominant religion
that young men
are being drawn to.
But in the context
of what we've described,
that person who sat
on the edge of their bed,
do they need religion?
And I'm being intentional
not to say God,
I'm saying religion.
Well, these are hard things
to do on your own, right?
I mean, you only have
the span of your life
and the probability
that you can figure out
how to live
merely as a consequence
of consulting
your own limited experience
is zero.
It's too complicated.
So the religion
might be your society,
it might be your friends,
your family
in this context.
That's part of it.
That would be
the more structured part,
the more traditional part.
you need the traditional stories.
That's why I wrote this book
is to indicate,
well, at least in part,
what the stories are
and also what they mean.
It's not only that,
it's not only what they mean,
it's how knowing
what they mean
changes your life.
So, for example,
in the story of Abraham,
God comes to Abraham.
Okay, now,
questions emerge
from that statement.
What do you mean God
and how does he come to Abraham?
What the hell does that mean?
Well, the story lays that out.
The God that comes to Abraham
is the voice of adventure.
It's a definition.
So this is a good thing to know.
God is the voice of adventure.
Okay, so now,
let's think about this
a little bit.
So,
the God
that's the voice of adventure
is the God
of the forefathers of Abraham.
The father.
He's a patriarchal spirit.
Okay,
if you're a good father,
you speak with the voice
of adventure
to your sons.
Obviously.
You know,
you're encouraging them.
It's like,
get the hell out there.
You know?
Make something of yourself.
Why do you do that?
Because you have this little kid
and you think,
get at it, man.
Let's see what you can be.
And so,
that's that voice
of the benevolent father.
And that's the spirit
of the ancestors.
And behind that,
there's the God
who's the voice of adventure.
If you pursue
the spirit of adventure,
there will be things
you have to give up.
Right?
You know that.
I mean,
you know,
you're taking steps.
We'd even stay that.
Steps forward in your life.
What do you mean forward?
What do you mean steps?
Well,
there are little adventures
you have that transform you
and transform your circumstances.
Okay?
You have that adventure
and you have to change
as a consequence of it.
You have to give up
your immaturity
so that you can take advantage
of this new opportunity.
Okay?
And that changes you.
Now you're a slightly
different person.
Now a new horizon
of opportunity opens up.
You have to make a sacrifice.
It's like,
okay,
looks like if I'm going
to do this,
I can no longer afford this.
Well,
Abraham changes so dramatically
that he gets a new name.
He starts as Abraham
and he ends as Abraham.
Abraham is the father of nations.
So what's the moral?
If you pursue the spirit of adventure
and make the proper sacrifices,
you become the father of nations.
Right?
That's true.
There's a really interesting,
I grew up as religious
until I was 18.
I say religious
because the term's difficult
to define to me,
but my mother was believed in God.
She was Christian.
My father's Christian.
And at about 18,
I started reading
a lot of Richard Dawkins' books
and other people's books.
And I got to this place
where I think I was atheist
by the definition of,
I didn't think there was
necessarily a God.
And now I find myself
in this place of being agnostic.
Now,
when I think about the Bible
as a compass
or as a guide,
the part of my brain
that's like rooted in this,
like,
I need evidence for everything.
Is this just a book
that a bunch of men wrote
thousands of years ago
when they were sat around
a campfire or whatever?
And if it is,
then it's just one person's opinion
as much as any self-help book
on a shelf
is one person's opinion.
Well,
okay,
let's take that claim apart.
I mean,
yes,
it is stories
that people came up
with thousands of years ago,
but no,
definitely not one person's opinion.
Definitely,
100% not.
Because these stories
have been transmitted
over millennia
and organized
and edited
and transformed
by a very large number
of people.
So it's,
at minimum,
it's a massive collective effort.
And it's a collective effort
undertaken by arguably
the most literate
and intelligent people
there are
and that'd be the Jews.
Why would I listen
to the Bible
more than I'd listen
to something Socrates wrote
or any philosopher?
Oh,
there's a huge overlap
between the Greco,
the Greek philosophical tradition
and the Christian tradition.
I mean,
Western culture
is the amalgamation
of Greece,
Jerusalem,
and Rome.
So,
and the early Christians
saw tremendous parallels
between Christian theology
and Greek philosophy.
Where do you think
we come from?
You know,
you've got the like
Darwinism evolutionary theory
of we've evolved,
et cetera.
Then there's the more
religious view that,
you know,
if you really think
about the First Testament
and the early Testament
and the stories
of the,
you know,
creation,
people think,
you know,
maybe we were just
popped out of nowhere.
But why do we youth
believe that we come from?
Do you believe
that God put us here
or do you believe that?
Do you believe evolution
is true?
Do you believe both are true?
You have to read the book.
You put,
I want to,
yeah.
But I'm not trying
to be a smart aleck
in that response.
It's a complicated answer.
Yeah.
It's a complicated answer.
I think that we're guided
by the spirit of meaning.
Okay?
I think that's also
our deepest instinct.
That's somewhat
Darwinism.
Well,
I had a rule
for this book
is I didn't make
any claims
about the biblical stories
that I couldn't
justify scientifically.
I don't think
there's a conflict.
I think that
viewing the
biblical stories
as an amalgam
of superstitious
proto-scientific theories
is absurd.
I don't think
there's any evidence
for that at all.
These are stories.
Stories and scientific
hypotheses
aren't the same thing.
The Lord of the Rings
is not
a scientific hypothesis.
But that doesn't
mean it's not true.
Do you believe
my great-great-great-great-granddad
was an amoeba?
Well,
if you go,
you were a sperm
at one point.
I mean,
it's not that implausible.
We all come
from single-celled organisms.
This is,
I'm asking these questions
because I'm genuinely,
it's like I'm genuinely
wrestling with
a bunch of big
existential questions
that I've actually
only been wrestling
with maybe for like,
I'd say a year.
So it's very fresh for me.
And it's funny,
my arc here is
religious Christian
up until maybe 18,
like staunch atheist
for two years
to the point
that it was like
my identity.
And then like,
let go of that,
drifted for a couple of years
and find myself
at this really interesting point
where I'm like back
at the door of like,
okay,
let's re-look
at some of these answers again.
Yeah.
Well,
that's exactly
why I wrote this book
because I know
that that's the time
and it's not just
the time for you.
That's the time
that we're in.
Yeah.
It's the time we're in.
Yeah.
Oh,
definitely.
Definitely.
Well,
it's partly because
the enlightenment
has exhausted itself.
Partly because it was wrong.
It's failed us,
the individualism.
Well,
I think exhausted
is a better word
because it wasn't like
the enlightenment
was without its benefits.
When you say
immense technological progress,
the materialist reductionism
of the atheist scientist.
Okay.
It's not right.
Factually,
they were wrong.
Their theory of perception
was wrong.
They're wrong.
We see the world
through a story.
We do not see the world
as a collection of facts.
They're wrong.
You see,
the postmodernists
figured this out
and that's why
the postmodernists
had a walloping influence
on culture.
Now,
I'm no fan
of the postmodernists
for a variety of reasons,
but their insistence
that we see the world
through a story,
that they're right.
That's right.
I agree.
I mean,
if you've,
if you obviously read
the book,
Sapiens
by Novel Harari
and his central point
is that
what bound us as humans
and stopped us being
these scattered chimps
were stories.
They bind us together.
So I completely understand
that we need a story.
It's how everything,
money, governments,
et cetera, function.
But what that story is,
now I can,
I can agree that-
It's a story
of voluntary sacrifice.
A hundred percent agree
that humans need that.
There's no chance
that we'd be here otherwise.
And it's a set of values
and principles.
Now,
those values and principles
are often found in religion,
but do they,
and a belief in a God,
but do they have to be?
Could they be found in,
could I theoretically
make a new religion
where me and my friends
all unite against
a set of values,
sacrifice,
giving,
parenthood?
That's a great question.
Well,
this is what Nietzsche
basically presupposed
in some ways.
So when Nietzsche observed
that God had died,
say in 1850
or thereabouts,
his medication for that,
his warning was,
we'll descend into nihilism
and communist totalitarianism.
And that was exactly right.
Maybe a mindless hedonism
in there too.
Dostoevsky concentrated
more on that.
Nietzsche said,
we'll have to create
our own values.
We'll have to become,
that's what the Superman is,
the Nietzschean Superman,
the man who creates
his own values.
Try.
See what happens.
You can't do it.
You can't create
your own values
because values are real.
They're not arbitrary.
They're not relativistic.
So imagine this.
Imagine there's
a very large number
of games that could be played,
like an infinitely large number.
But there's a very small number
of games that people want to play.
Then there's even
a smaller number of games
that sustain themselves
and improve as you play them.
Okay, so that's like a landscape.
You can think about it
as a landscape
of potential patterns
of interaction.
You could even think about it
as a landscape
of potential tribal affiliations.
The rules of those games
would be the principles
of the society.
Okay, now your question is,
could we come up
with our own set of rules?
And the answer to that
is no.
Why?
Because the sustainable,
abundant playability
of a game
is not arbitrary.
So for example,
if you want to get along
with your wife,
she has to want to play
the game you're playing.
Okay, now,
there's lots of games
you could play
that aren't going to fit
that criteria.
Yeah.
Now then imagine
it's even worse though
because to get along
with your wife,
she has to want to play
the game you want to play.
But both of you
have to play a game
that works today
and tomorrow
and next week,
next month,
next year, right?
And then you have to play it
with your kids
and your parents
and a bunch of other people.
So can I ask then,
so is it the case
that humans are designed
in such a way
where there's a certain
set of values
and stories
that are most conducive
with their
reproductive survival?
And so if that's true
and I completely agree,
I understand why
that would be true
because it's true
for all species.
Like there's a set
of stories and narratives
probably in my dog
if you go back
to 100 years
from when his ancestors
were in the wild
that he needed
to subscribe to
to reproduce
to be a dog
and to survive.
But so the question
then becomes
where do those values
come from?
Are they innate within us
because of our
environmental factors?
So I need to be this way
because of the environment
I live in
so that I can have sex
with somebody
and reproduce
because of
I have two arms,
two legs, etc.
I'm this advanced chimp
or do they come
from above somewhere
and they grant it down
to me?
Because if I look
at every animal
Not or, and.
Oh, and, okay.
Yeah, yeah.
It's the same thing.
It's, you're looking
at the same problem
from two different
perspectives.
It's and.
Yes, they're handed
down from on high.
Yes, they're instincts.
So who are they
handed down from?
Yeah.
Well, the, the,
the religious.
Do you struggle
with this question?
Well, it's a complicated
question.
But do you struggle
with the answer?
I, I struggle
with making the answer
simple enough
to offer rapidly.
Are you clear
yourself on it?
not as clear
as I could be.
What is it
you wrestle with?
I've said what I read.
Well, clarity
is part of it.
Do you mean,
we want to make things
as clear as possible.
Breadth of coverage.
Right.
I mean, I'm,
people ask me
what I believe
and I say,
well, I'm not hiding
what I believe.
I'm like,
I lecture about it.
I podcast about it.
I write about it.
It's like,
that's what I believe.
There it is.
Is there obfuscation
in that?
Well, some,
partly things
are complicated.
So it's,
it's very difficult
to give short answers
to complex questions.
They,
you tend to give,
if you give short answers
to complex questions,
the answers tend
to be symbolic.
Yeah.
You have to say something
like,
where do they come from?
It's like,
well, they come from God.
Now, is that a useful answer?
Well, it's a short answer.
So it's useful
in that it's short.
It begs the question,
what do you mean by God?
We could return to that.
In the story of Abraham,
these are definitions.
Because if you're going
to talk about
what's properly put
in the highest place,
you have to know
what you're talking about.
Okay.
In the story of Abraham,
the voice of adventure
is to be put
in the highest place.
And if you follow that,
then you become
the father of nations.
That's reproductive success.
Right?
So that means the idea
is that there's an alignment
between the instinct
that calls you to adventure
and the probability
that you'll be attractive
to women
in the manner
that ensures
the survival
of your descendants.
And is that an environmental?
It's both.
It's both.
It's both.
It emerges
as a consequence
of the constraints
of social interaction,
let's say.
Like there's constraints,
for example,
on what makes a man
desirable to a woman.
Yeah.
Right?
That has nothing to do
with you,
those constraints.
Those are there.
Right?
They're there
in the society of women.
They're eternal.
They're not...
No woman,
she might vary
in her opinion
to some degree,
but she partakes
of the pattern.
So it's there.
Now,
it's also built into you
because you're
a social creature
and so your physiology
indicates to you
the nature
of that pattern.
So does my dog
have a different religion
to me?
Does he have a different God?
To some degree.
There's an overlap
because you can communicate...
Your dog understands you
and vice versa.
So there's...
That's a good question.
Social mammals
understand each other.
Right.
So there's an overlap
in their deepest instincts
or their highest impulses.
You can think about
that both ways.
I was going through my head
and thinking about
like the Venus flytrap
and my French bulldog,
Pablo,
and they all need
a different set of behaviors
and principles
and values
to survive and thrive
and be happy.
you can think about that
as sure, sure.
So I was thinking then
does that mean
that they all have
a different God?
They have a nature.
Yeah, they have
a different intrinsic nature.
That's another way
of thinking about it.
Yeah, because of the environment
and the factors
that they face
as that species.
So then Pablo's God
might be slightly different
to my God
if we're talking about...
Because I'm trying to understand
if like this idea of God
is a set of evolutionary motivations.
Yes, it is.
It is that.
You can think about it
as rising up
from the material world
or descending from on heaven.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter fundamentally.
It's the same...
It doesn't matter.
Those are different ways
of looking at the same problem.
When I say evolutionary motivations,
it doesn't feel so divine.
It doesn't feel like a place,
a reason to gather in a church.
It feels like
I'm just kind of a robot
that's being steered
by these motivations
of don't do that,
do this.
This feels good.
If you're with your friends
and family,
you feel good,
so do that more.
And if you're with your friends
and family,
you're safer,
so you're more likely
to have kids.
Or is it this sort of divine thing
that society has told us God is
where we should worship
and we should thank you so much
and go to a church
and get on our knees
and pray?
Because they're two
very different things.
One is like practical
and pragmatic
and the other one
is this divine thing.
Okay.
Here's one way
of thinking about it.
So,
I mentioned that
in the story of Abraham,
God is the call to adventure.
Okay,
so that's the definition.
Now,
the divine
that's put forward
in these library of stories
has multiple characteristics.
He's characterized in many ways,
but there's an insistence
that that reflects
an underlying unity.
Now,
the unity is incomprehensible
in its essence.
Okay,
so you have to accept that
as the initial starting point.
You're not going to get
the answer.
Yeah.
Okay.
You can see something complex
from a variety
of different perspectives.
Okay.
In the story of Noah,
God is the impulse
that comes to the wise
to prepare
when trouble's brewing.
Yeah.
Okay,
now,
okay,
so now you can think
of that as an instinct.
You can think about it as
gut instinct,
intuition.
Negative emotion,
anxiety,
but it's more than that
because it's,
you can be afraid
of something
that isn't real.
Yeah.
Okay,
now you might have
to ask yourself,
okay,
what are the preconditions
for your fear?
What are the preconditions
to the validity
of your fear?
So you're afraid
and you should be.
Well,
let's say that's a characteristic
of someone who's wise.
Okay,
so then the question is,
well,
what's the essence
of the wisdom
that makes your fear valid?
Noah is described
in the story of Noah
as a man wise
in his generations.
So that means
that by the moral standards
of his time,
he's an upstanding
human being.
Okay,
so now you can imagine
that means he exists
in harmonious relationship
with his present self
and his future self.
Okay,
that makes him mature.
But then he also
does that in a way
that serves his wife
and his family
and his community.
So his self
is balanced
and optimized
across those parameters.
That makes him
secure in his foundation
and properly oriented.
If you're secure
in your foundation
and properly oriented
upward,
then there's no difference
between the voice
of the divine
and the instinct
that preserves you
in times of trouble.
But you see,
you can't exactly get there
by the mere bottom-up
materialistic notion
because you can think
about the fear
that guides Noah
as an instinct,
but the instinct
is pathological
unless it exists
in this wider
moral framework
because then
you could have
the fear of a coward.
Well,
that's not helpful.
The wider moral framework,
could that wider
moral framework
just be,
I'm in my DNA,
I'm hardwired
to want to reproduce?
Yeah,
but even reproduction
is,
see,
this is,
I think,
where Dawkins
went dreadfully wrong.
Sex and reproduction
aren't the same thing
for people.
Not anymore,
certainly.
Well,
not at all
because we're
high investment
reproducers.
Sex just gets
the ball rolling.
So,
so here's a question.
How would you have
to act
to maximally
ensure the survival
of your offspring?
Okay,
so now,
what do you mean
survival?
Do you mean
that your son lives?
Do you mean
that your grandson lives?
Do you mean
that 20 generations
down the road
from you,
the pattern
that you represented
is still propagating
itself successfully?
Does it mean
that the people
that you produce
are able to take
on all challengers
because of the manner
in which they conduct
themselves?
That's a lot more
complicated than
just sex,
like way more
complicated.
So the pattern
that Abraham,
so Abraham is
the father of nations,
right?
The,
the,
there's an insistence
in the story
that the manner
in which he conducts
himself
as a hero
establishes the pattern
that makes his descendants
successful
eternally.
I,
I just can't figure out
whether this is,
whether,
like what,
what order things
happened in,
in terms of,
is the Bible
just a consequence
of people
trying to figure out
our evolutionary
motivations
and turn them
into these stories
that guide us?
Why just?
Okay,
we can remove
the word just.
Well,
but that's an important
removal.
Yeah,
it's an important
removal
because it's,
you know,
because it has
bound people.
Does the Bible
impart the story
of human beings
coming to consciousness?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Okay,
yeah.
Does it reflect
a deeper underlying reality?
Yes.
Yeah.
How deep
is that underlying?
Well,
let's say,
okay,
it's a story
about the psyche.
And then let's say,
well,
no,
it's a story
about the psyche
in society.
Okay,
so,
well,
no,
it's a story
about the psyche
in society
in the natural world.
Okay,
well,
what's underneath that?
The source of nature,
society,
and the psyche.
This is an interesting
question.
It's a very direct one,
but I would love
just an answer that I,
because I haven't got
clarity on this.
What is it you,
what God is it
that you believe in?
I've heard you talk
about this sort of
substrate idea and such,
but in a simple way
that I can understand,
do you believe in
a man in the sky,
God?
Do you believe in
it's a force?
Well,
that's not as primitive
a conceptualization
as the atheists
would have you believe.
What is it you believe?
Well,
there isn't anything
more complex
in the known universe
than a human brain.
So,
if you want to model
for reality as such,
like,
proclaiming that
it has something
akin to the structure
of the human psyche
is not an absurd claim,
given that that is
the most complex thing
by far
that we know of,
by far.
So,
what is it you believe?
Well,
I've been explaining it.
But,
I mean,
I did say,
I mentioned something
which we skipped over
very quickly
because I introduced
it too rapidly.
The postmodernists
figured out
that we live in a story,
but then they leapt
to a faulty conclusion
of two forms,
well,
three.
there's no uniting story.
That was one
of their conclusions.
In fact,
the definition
of postmodernism
is skepticism
of metanarratives.
There's no uniting story.
It's like,
well,
that's a stupid theory
because it,
there's no union.
So what?
There's just diversity.
Well,
we worship diversity now
in this utterly foolish manner.
There's no difference
between diversity and war.
Without a uniting narrative,
there's nothing but war.
So,
no,
that's not going to work.
Wrong.
Hedonistic self-gratification.
There's Michel Foucault for you
to a T.
It's like,
why is that wrong?
Why can't people
just do what they want
with whoever they want
all the time?
Because it defeats itself
and quickly.
It's not a sustainable game.
If it's all about you
and your whims,
I don't want to be anywhere
near you.
And that won't be so good
for you.
That's not going to work.
Power.
That's really where
the postmodernists landed
with their,
what would you say,
temptation to turn
towards Marx.
It's all about power.
It's like,
first of all,
that's probably a confession
if that's what you believe.
And second,
no,
it's not.
Try tyrannizing your wife
and see how well
that works for you.
Try tyrannizing yourself
and see how successful
you are.
Power's not the game.
Okay,
what's the game?
What's the story?
I mentioned earlier,
it's voluntary
self-sacrifice.
Right,
you offer yourself up
in the service
of something higher.
That's the basis
of society.
That's the basis
of psychological stability.
The Christian insistence
is that that's the basis
of the world.
I'm going to ask you again
because I want to be clear.
What is the God
you believe in?
I think that the claim
that Christ is the embodiment
of the prophet
and the laws,
I think that's true.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's complicated.
It's very,
very complicated.
But I think it's true.
So you believe
that Jesus was
God?
God.
Yeah.
I think
if you understand
what that means
that it's indisputable.
I'll give you
a brief
explanation of why.
Christ takes
the sins
of the world
onto himself.
So that means
all the problems
that there are
are his problems.
Right.
Okay.
So
the idea there
is that there's
no difference
between making
that assumption
and then actually
beginning to address
those problems.
And there's no
difference between
that which best
addresses the
problems of mankind
and the divine.
Those are the same thing.
And I can't see
how that can be
otherwise.
Because the
contrary hypothesis
would be that
you would adapt
best to your life
by avoiding things
that are difficult
and terrifying.
And no one
believes that.
And so the pattern
of the passion
this is the
voluntary self-sacrifice
issue taken
to its extreme.
The pattern
of the passion
is the decision
to voluntarily
confront and welcome
anything that
happens to you
no matter what
it is.
and that's a terrible
thing to ask
or endeavor
to undertake.
But
well, the alternative
is to shrink away.
Well,
the spirit of shrinking
away is the divine.
It's like,
I don't think so.
Like that's preposterous.
the spirit
of unlimited
courage.
Well,
that's not a bad
start for a definition
of what constitutes
the divine.
The highest
possible value.
Has your belief
in God,
religion,
been shaken
at all?
Oh,
yes.
Definitely.
Because you've been
constantly.
Over the last
year and a half,
two years,
you've been through
a particularly difficult
time with losing
people in your life
that are
sort of foundational
to you.
Tammy as well.
Oh, yeah.
Well,
and I was in
extreme pain
for three years.
Right.
I went through
three years
where every minute
of my life
was worse
than any minute
I had ever had
previous to that.
It was terrible.
And
did I lose faith?
Was it questioned?
Challenged?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
It just became
absurd.
It was absurd.
So many things
had gone
off the rails.
In
my wife was dying,
my daughter was ill.
I was
things had blown up
around me
in 50 different ways.
And I was
like
seriously
in pain.
It was terrible.
I was walking
like 12 miles
a day
because I couldn't
sit.
I did that
for months.
Winter,
rain,
whenever.
I had a friend
who walked
with me.
It was terrible.
And yeah,
I mean,
I thought,
what was the desperation?
It wasn't even
the pain.
It was the fact
that I was in such
terrible shape
that I felt
that I was a
felt,
I believed
that I was a burden
to everyone around me
and that that was
only likely
to get worse.
And I thought,
what's the sense
in this?
What's the possible
significance of this?
So yes,
everyone's faith
is challenged.
I mean,
Christ himself
cries in despair
out to God
on the cross.
And the story
wouldn't be believable
without that.
Like,
if you're going to live,
you're going to be
pushed past your limit.
Right?
If you're going to live.
So,
but who knows
what you discover
when you're pushed
past your limit.
In that moment,
you know,
I've been in my relationship
for some time now
and I genuinely think
I'd rather,
I'd rather die myself
than my partner die.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And you were there
as Tammy was struggling
with her health.
Yeah.
Which is not something
I've heard you
actually talk about before
in what I've observed.
She was,
she was dying.
Is that harder to take
for you
than your own pain
and struggle?
I think generally
if you love someone,
it's worse to see them
suffer than to suffer yourself.
You certainly figure that out
when you have kids.
And this all happens
at the same moment,
the same couple of years
of your life.
Uh-huh.
Is there anything to,
you know,
people always search
for silver linings
and things.
Is there anything?
We're both alive.
My family's thriving.
My adventure is expanding.
Life isn't fair, is it?
Doesn't appear to be very fair.
Because, I mean,
this is how your story
ended in that regard.
But it could have...
I don't know
if an adventure is fair.
I don't even know
if that's what we want.
Like, this is something
I really came to understand
more deeply
when writing this book.
What are we built for?
We're built for maximal challenge.
And that isn't the way
we view ourselves
in the modern world.
We view ourselves
as built for pleasure,
you know, pornography.
We view ourselves
as built for consumption
or for safety
or for...
or for...
for maybe
for egotistical
self-aggrandizement
and fame.
Those are...
Look,
many...
All of those things
are better than
their absence,
let's say.
You know,
I think part of the reason
that Andrew Tate
is so popular
among young men
because it's better
to be a successful reprobate
than a useless scrounger.
Seriously.
I mean, seriously.
But that's why
the villain in stories
is often admirable
compared to the coward.
Right?
At least the villain
is out there, like,
doing villain things.
You know?
But...
At least he has meaning.
Well, and he's not...
He's not...
The villain,
at least the villain
has meaning.
The villain's on a quest
of sorts.
You know?
And a committed villain
can learn.
That's another thing, too.
What are we built for?
I think we're built
for maximal challenge.
And that's...
That's way more interesting.
I mean,
one of the things that...
See,
I figured out that lies...
That totalitarian states
were a consequence of lies
in about 1985.
I really figured it out.
I'd been reading Solzhenitsyn
and Carl Jung.
I'd been reading...
I was reading a lot.
I was really obsessed by it.
I thought,
oh, I see.
So,
hell is the dominion
of the lie.
Okay,
so what do you do about that?
Well,
you stop lying.
That's how you fight it.
And that means
you do that
in your own life.
You just stop.
Just.
You practice stopping.
You practice not doing
the things you know
you shouldn't do.
You practice
paying attention
to your words
to see if they're
landing solidly
and they make you confident
instead of weak.
Right?
You abandon your
short-term
desire for control
and power
understanding that
there isn't anything
better that can happen
to you
than what happens
if you tell the truth.
Right?
No matter what it looks
like to you
in the moment.
It's a strange thing,
but I can't see
how it could be otherwise
because you'd have
to hypothesize
that you're
going to align yourself
with life,
with nature,
with society,
with God,
with yourself
by lying.
No one believes that.
You might think
you can get away with it.
That's way different.
Right?
But no one believes that.
So,
well,
so then
what happens
in consequence of that?
Well,
I think
what happens
in consequence of that
is what happened
to Abraham.
Your life just goes
like this.
Just opens
and opens
and opens
and opens
and I don't think
there's any limp
to that.
And that's
ridiculously
entertaining.
Like,
unbearably entertaining.
There's what you want
in your life.
You want it to be
unbearably entertaining.
And it's funny,
you know,
when you watch people
go to movies,
I mean,
James Bond,
right?
That's an unbearably
entertaining life.
And that's what people
want to see
when they go to a theater
because that's what
they want.
That's what they want.
And maybe all the sorrow
and catastrophe
that's part of that
has to be part of it
because otherwise
there's nothing
about it
that's glorious.
Why does that
move you so much?
Because life
is very wide.
you know,
there's
the peaks
and valleys
are
very distant
from one another.
And I don't know,
maybe as you
ascend uphill,
your
understanding
of the
chasm
between the peaks
and valleys
also increases.
You know,
because you think
maybe as you're
successful,
you're happier.
Well,
first of all,
I'm not sure
that success
and happiness
are the same thing.
I'm not sure
that we want them
to be the same thing.
I don't even know
what people mean
when they say
they want to be happy.
If you investigate it,
technically,
you'll find out
that really what people
mean when they say
they want to be happy
is that they
don't want to suffer.
That's different
than the enthusiastic
joy that you might
think about,
you know,
that's part and parcel
of a child's laughter.
You want to be happy.
What,
do you want to be laughing
all the time?
Is that what you're saying?
Well,
no,
that's not what I mean.
Well,
what do you mean?
Do you mean the gratification
that comes along
with the cookie
at one in the morning?
No,
that's not what I mean.
Well,
okay,
what do you mean?
Well,
I don't know.
It's like,
yeah,
you don't know.
Partly what you mean
is you don't want
pointless suffering.
Fair enough,
you know,
fair enough.
But that doesn't mean
it's happiness
that's your goal.
There's no sense.
I don't think
that's your goal.
I don't think
your podcast
would be successful
if that was your goal.
I think you would have
washed up on the shoals
of triviality
long ago.
I do.
Well,
there's something
you're doing
that's working.
There's something
about the way
you're approaching
the situation
that's of broad appeal.
There's some
archetypal pattern
that's
you're acting out
in your conduct
in your podcast
because otherwise
it wouldn't have
the effect it has.
Hmm.
It's true.
I agree.
I don't know
what it is
but because...
Well,
you know some of it.
We talked about
some of it.
You know,
you said that
you can
apprehend
the outline
of some of the principles.
Some of that
you probably discovered
as you went along
rather than,
you know,
putting them in place
to begin with.
This seems to work.
Yeah.
You know?
So that's a discovery
of a pathway.
Well,
as a podcaster as well,
I don't think
you really truly
understand your principles
until they're tested.
So,
and especially
when they're tested
from both sides.
So,
you know,
this side's telling you
to be more like this
and this side's screaming
at you to be more like this
and you're faced
with a decision.
When you're,
you know,
when I started out
as a podcaster,
there was no one screaming.
There was no one there.
Right, right.
But at some point
in the journey,
you get immense pressure.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, then you're also...
And that forces
a decision out of you.
Yeah, well,
you're also in a situation
then when you have
to start worrying
about your reputation,
which is something
you don't have to worry
about when no one
knows who you are.
And it's very dangerous
to worry about
your reputation.
As soon as you start
worrying about your reputation
as a podcaster,
you're going to fail.
Because you're not
interesting then.
You'll stop taking risks.
Yeah.
So then, you know,
another question emerges.
You've got people
yelling at you
from this side
and this side.
Well, how do you know
what's right?
Well, it isn't...
Partly it's by listening
because you want to pay
attention to your audience,
but there's something
guiding you
if you do
what you're doing properly
that has nothing to do
with the clamor.
Yeah.
It's funny
because actually
it links back
to some of the principles
we've talked about today.
It's one of the things
I've learned
is having a good relationship,
like good friendships
and a good relationship
with my wife
is actually the foundation
for me to be able
to navigate
the people screaming
at me from both sides.
Yeah, why?
Because it just anchors me
in...
It's like an anchor
of like knowing
who I actually am
irrespective of the...
Crowd.
The crowd telling you
who you are.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, that's a good...
That's a very good
illustration
of distributed identity.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like you are your wife
and your friends
and your family.
Yeah.
Right?
There's no...
Fundamentally,
there cannot be
any separation there.
That's...
Yeah.
And you said
you've experienced that.
It's like that's what gives you...
That's part of what
gives you a foundation.
It's like, yeah,
that's not illusory.
And it's nice
because as you said,
like when I go out
into the world,
everyone is very nice to me.
It's just if you spend
too long on the internet,
people scream at you
from both sides.
They say,
do it more like this.
Do it like this.
Where are the CEOs?
This is called diverse here.
We want more of these
kind of guests.
We should talk about this.
Politics.
Kamala.
Trump.
And in the middle of that,
you're just going,
fucking hell.
And that's where you have
to take some time
to really like tune in
to yourself and go,
who am I and why am I doing this?
And what are my principles?
And irrespective
of the principles I choose
or I believe in,
there's going to be suffering
and there's going to be sacrifice.
And there's going to be
great adventure as well.
And the good...
One thing I really like
that helps me
for some bizarre reason
is the knowledge
that I will die someday.
Why does that help?
It just...
It's a good question.
It's a good question.
Why does it help?
It helps because
if I think it's focusing in me
on what actually matters.
Yeah.
In a way that I wouldn't be...
It wouldn't be as easy to otherwise.
What it's saying is,
it's just a reminder of,
okay, if I'm going to die someday,
then actually this person
is screaming at me
to be more like this.
It obviously doesn't matter.
Like it obviously doesn't matter
in the context of my other priorities.
Well, it might be that death
is what makes things matter.
Scarcity always makes the value
of something.
Well, right.
But then we're talking about
a kind of ultimate scarcity.
Yeah.
And like you can ask yourself,
one of the fundamental questions
you can ask yourself is,
what is the nature of the real?
Right?
And I think death makes things real.
I agree.
Yeah.
That's why it's an important,
I don't know,
seems like a weird thing to say,
but it reminds me
that what's trivial
and what's not,
in the context of a finite amount
of resources, time,
attention that I can commit,
it's foolish to commit some of them
to some of the things
that I find myself committing them to
sometimes when I remind myself
of that death.
How do you pick your guests?
Curiosity.
Yeah, that's,
I pick people I want to talk to.
Yeah.
It's like,
I'd like to hear
what that person has to say.
Yeah.
And it's something
that I'm trying to learn.
So it's typically,
when I'd seen you wrote a book
called We Who Wrestle With God.
That's the word Israel,
that's what Israel means.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.
And that's the chosen people of God,
Israel.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
But I thought,
this is a subject
that I'm curious about.
So I would like to talk to Jordan
to see if he can help me,
you know,
fill in this sort of jigsaw puzzle
in my brain
of subject matters
that relate to this.
And I evolve.
I'm probably gonna have kids soon.
And when I have my kids,
I'm gonna be curious
about parenthood
and I'm gonna speak to,
you know,
guests that can help me with that.
That's been my framework.
Uh-huh.
And it's worked in terms of,
I still like doing this.
Well, there's no reason to,
so when I'm on stage lecturing,
I'm on a journey.
It's a real journey.
Yeah.
It's not an act.
Like, I pose a question to myself
before I go on stage.
It's a question I want the answer to
and I don't have.
And I go on stage
and I try to move towards the answer.
And people come along
and I wanna go there
and they wanna come along.
It's a good deal.
And the podcasts are like that.
If you're doing them honestly,
it's like,
I wanna talk to this person.
That's a really nice way
of thinking about it,
moving towards an answer.
Yeah.
Not even sure what the answer is, but.
Well, and it'll change as you approach it.
Move towards the answer.
Right?
The questions and the answers change
as you move towards it.
That's okay.
That's fine.
We were touching this earlier,
but it's something that I wanted to touch on
because one of the themes of this podcast
is often the subject of grief.
And I read that you'd lost both of your parents
within sort of six months of each other.
Mm-hmm.
What does that moment teach you about priorities,
about life, about what matters,
about anything that you could pass down to me
that's important?
Things last way less long than you think.
So you should be aware of that
and not take things for granted.
No, and so,
and I don't think I took my parents for granted.
Now, did I do that perfectly?
Well, we don't do things perfectly,
but it was pretty good.
It was pretty good.
I learned when my...
I watched my wife's family
go through the death of their mother,
and one of the consequences of that
was that my wife and her siblings
and her father pulled closer together
during that time.
And that really,
it was like a wound healing, you know?
Mm-hmm.
And so I saw that,
and I saw that that worked.
So, for example,
Tammy has a stronger relationship
with her older brother
than she did before
her father also died.
So we lost her father
and my father
and my mother this year, basically.
It isn't that her brother
substituted for her father,
but it was that there was more there
than she had made use of.
And so when her father departed,
the possibility of expanding
that relationship with her brother
was on the table.
And I did the same thing
with my sister and my brother.
And that's helpful.
It's helpful.
So there's opportunity everywhere.
Even in grief, there's opportunity.
Is there one lesson
that your father taught you
that stayed with you?
Pay attention.
He was good at that.
He was good at,
he taught that very well.
And it wasn't a good idea
to not pay attention around my father.
He, uh, he had a,
he wasn't, he wasn't,
I wouldn't describe him
as an easy person.
He had high standards
and he was rather unforgiving.
And that's,
I don't know,
do you forgive the people
that you love
for not being everything
they could be?
That's a hard question.
It's okay, dear.
It's like, is it now?
I think we have a lot of that
in our culture.
It's okay.
I like you just like you are.
I'm...
Do you forgive him?
Yeah, yes.
I don't think they're...
My dad and I
sorted out our differences
a long time ago.
You know, when I left home,
our relationship
was somewhat fractious
from the time I was 13
to the time I left home.
He developed quite a severe depression,
which ran in my family,
and that made him
harder to understand
than had been the case previously.
It also made the probability
that if there were
events in the household
that they would be...
They'd have more
reverberation
than they would have otherwise.
And that was confusing to me.
Mm-hmm.
I understood
why that happened later,
not much later,
and it wasn't very long
after I left home
that whatever differences
I had with my father
were irrelevant.
So we didn't really have
unresolved issues,
I wouldn't say.
What about your mother?
What's the one lesson?
My mum was great.
What's the lesson?
If any, she left with you.
My mother was
a very hospitable person.
And in the Old Testament accounts,
hospitality is a cardinal virtue.
And she was very good
at making people welcome.
The day my mother died,
I thought about her
most of the day.
That day,
memories came to mind.
And one of the things
I realized about my mother
was that I don't have
a single negative memory
of my mother.
It's really quite something
to know someone
for 62 years.
And really,
I really don't have
a negative memory
of my mother.
I don't remember
any time
where she acted
and she was a good person,
my mother.
I could always make her laugh.
She had a very good sense of humor.
I appreciated that a lot.
And she,
although she was
a very agreeable person
and a very feminine person,
she was tough too.
And she wasn't
a Oedipal type.
You know,
she had strong
protective instincts,
but her desire
to help her children
become independent
trumped that for sure.
Jordan,
we have a closing tradition
on this podcast
where the last guest
leaves a question
for the next,
not knowing who
they're leaving it for.
And the question
left for you
is how do you feel
most misunderstood?
Hmm.
I don't know
if I am misunderstood.
I think the people
who don't like me,
some of them
have me confused
with some figment
of their imagination.
Some of the people
who don't like me,
they understand me.
They just don't like
what they understand.
They don't like
what it implies.
And so,
that's okay with me.
I don't feel
misunderstood,
I wouldn't say.
I've got nothing
to complain about.
People who've been
listening to me,
they understand me,
and as far as I can tell,
that's been very good
for them.
And that's unbelievably
gratifying for me.
It's,
you must experience that.
I mean,
your podcast
has had a broad effect,
and I presume
a positive effect
on people.
There isn't anything
better than that,
to see that
what you're doing
has that broadly
salutary effect.
That's great.
That's another indication
of our essentially,
I would say,
religious nature.
You know,
Jocko Willink
told me this.
You know,
Jocko said
that he could,
he could have easily
been like a gang
leader,
criminal type.
He's a tough
warrior character,
you know.
And he said
when he went
into the military,
he discovered
that being the leader
of a team
and moving people
in a positive direction,
there wasn't anything
better than that.
And so,
that just straightened
him out,
you know.
And I feel
exactly the same way.
There isn't anything
better than that.
And so,
I'm able to do that
and I see the evidence
of that all the time.
And whatever
misunderstandings
there might be
about me,
necessary or unnecessary,
are so trivial
compared to that
that they're not,
they don't even
really register.
What a privilege.
That's for sure.
Jordan,
thank you so much.
It's a privilege we share
because doing this for me
is a great privilege
and the fact that it
positively impacts anyone
is everything you've just said.
And I see that in your work,
but also I see it
when we have these conversations
in the immense avalanche
of people who profess
that you've changed
their life in some positive way
and moved them
in a better direction.
And that's irrefutable
and no one can,
you know,
I mean,
as I say,
there's no greater privilege.
So, Jordan,
thank you so much for your time.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
You bet.
Thanks for the invitation again.
It's always a pleasure
talking to you.
Thank you.
Isn't this cool?
Every single conversation
I have here on The Diary of a CEO,
at the very end of it,
you'll know,
I ask the guest
to leave a question
in The Diary of a CEO.
And what we've done
is we've turned
every single question
written in The Diary of a CEO
into these conversation cards
that you can play at home.
So, you've got every guest
we've ever had,
their question,
and on the back of it,
if you scan that QR code,
you get to watch
the person
who answered that question.
We're finally revealing
all of the questions
and the people
that answered the question.
The brand new
version 2
updated conversation cards
are out right now
at theconversationcards.com.
They've sold out
twice instantaneously,
so if you are interested
in getting hold of some
limited edition
conversation cards,
I really, really recommend
acting quickly.
up to the third
episode.
So,
you
can't find
more
than
the
industry.
