the ipi group hey hey hey melvin and others from the ipi group hey thanks for inviting me melvin
and uh this by the way this is all the stuff that we're talking about here is hot off the press
i've been working on this talk for a month now because i've had a whole bunch of new insights
starting in jan in december and then in march as well and so we're going to be talking about
several things here and i'm going to talk i'm going to talk about it step by step so you guys
understand what happened with with me and my understanding of all this and so this is really
hot off the press this is brand new so uh if you had seen my other talk some of it's going to be
building on all of that so nothing that i've done before is wrong it's just that it has to be built
on top of it by adding this existence label and what that means okay so you know i've
talked a little bit about this has already been is but i've been working for over 30 years on this
and i really it from bit was sort of my mantra and that was my phd in 2002 on quantum computing
using geometric algebra so i've been a big geometric algebra fan and clifford algebra is the more general
name for that and people sometimes use geometric algebra and clifford algebra interchangeably and um
my particular perspective is is that i'm using a subset of clifford algebra or geometric algebra
that has is orthonormal it only has plus and minus one um plus and minus one coefficients and zero so
it's kind of like putting the whole universe in unit cubes hyperdimensional unit cubes and then they
reflect off the edges of the unit cubes so you never have a value of a scalar that has two in it and i'll
talk about that a little bit more so so that's what all these are about and so i call this bit
vectors i also call these hyperbits and uh and we're going to learn what i learned about that these hyper
bits support spinners and therefore they also support what we what they know about standard model
i'm going to go into that in quite length and detail and then in march um i decided i needed a better
name to talk about what i was doing so i came up with the name existence and soon after that a friend of
mine who happens to be in the meeting today here um and she's going to say a few words in a minute and
you know at the end of the talk um she said the existence like your new name you know and i'm going
oh okay what does that mean and so so this is what you're going to hear from this is what i learned from
being able to all of a sudden realize that existence are conscious entities and they are equivalent to the
hyperbits i've been working on for 30 years so this makes total sense to me in retrospect um and so
you'll i'm going to go through this step by step so you understand where i'm coming from so um so just
here's a source science history my source science is what i refer to my work as and you know and the
key some key things here is i've been working on simulation hypothesis i've been interested in
metaphysics since the 80s robert john you know uh dean of engineering at princeton bill simulators
fiscom conferences i was at the monroe institute i saw early on i was interested in metaphysics
and i wrote some very very famous papers this is a very famous scalability physical scalability
sabotage performance gains and this is very famous because i use relativity ideas to show why
semiconductors don't scale and so there's you know you can see those all of these on my website and my
and my phd in quantum computing using geometric algebra and even got a million dollar grant to
study quantum and neural computing in the early 2000s and also studied neurolinguistic programming
and that's important to what we're doing today too and then wrote the book with will tiller he's famous
metaphysics researcher and and then i co-founded a company in 2002 on coherent spaces and we'll talk a
little bit about that at the end and i also what i do this is speak about hyperbit physics and math
and of course now exist on so so here's if you're trying to think of a theory of everything a lot of
people say a theory of everything and most of the time people are working on on what quantum computing
and quantum field theory and bits and qubits and ebits that upper right quadrant in this chart
okay and then other people now there's a huge development on on ai and what's called general ai
artificially general intelligence and so but problem with all of that ai is that they're
simulating hyperdimensional space they don't actually have a hyperdimensional space they're
simulating at three dimensions so they don't really have what i would call meaning and therefore they're
restricted to by compared to what humans can do and we're going to talk about that a little bit more
but there's all these intersections of these and of course most of science ignores the consciousness and
group consciousness and spiritually transformative experiences side so if unless you include all of
these you really don't you really not you're only looking at part of the problem and i call in the
middle section the intersection of all these real intelligences this is and now with the label
existence on that okay and so my source science is essentially a big theory of everything model
that represented by the existence math of conscious hyperbit so that's what's going on
um with with how i would talk to my intersection in the middle here but there's other people doing
similar kinds of things that specifically they're interested in consciousness's primary and simulation
hypothesis so people like federico faget fagin fagin and tom campbell people like roger sir roger
penrose is working on consciousness and gravity um he's but he's working with microtubules unfortunately so
i don't believe microtubules is the cause of consciousness as a result of this work so now
you can see where i'm coming from and also another guy who's who's worked on uh ctmu chris chris langdon
has a model like this as well others people do too the problem is is there's so many silos right now
that they're not all working together and my goal is to sort of give a common framework that we can all
work together especially with the ipi group you guys are a bunch of smart people half of most of what you
guys say go right over my head and i'll give you reasons why we should work together and how we
should work together by the end of this talk so i've given this slide many times because people
don't understand you know where exactly is um all of this stuff coming from so most people don't realize
that as you get down to the plank scale what's below that you know if you get down to um plank length
or plank thing or even a bit on the surface of the black hole we know that it from bit is there
because of john wheeler so what is below all this and i call this the domain of no space no time and
no metrics and this is a hard thing for people to realize is that you can't assume space and time
exists yet and if there's no space and time then there's no metrics based on space and time which
includes energy so so i call this hyperspace and it has bits and qubits in it and and i call this
protophysics but it does support ebit so here's it's a topological thing so so this is what this
is the area that i'm working so this is my latest label for what i'm working on i've always been
calling it hyperbits but existence are conscious hyperbits so that's the new layer okay it's a simple
single primitive construct for both objective and subjective reality and it solves the hard problem of
physicality and this is part of the why i've spent a month writing this talk you know john uh landauer
said basically information is physical in the 60s and landauer was a keynote speaker at my 1992 conference
so i've been interested in his work for a long time so if information is physical and i have a
mathematical representation for bits as dimensions then i'm arguing that bit math is also physical and i'm
going to give you that argument here today and it's and these are space-like hyperbit math and so most
people say that math is just math and i'm saying no if the math represents an infinite dimensional
orthonormal vector space bit dimensions i call them hyperbits if those are the root of all of the things
that we're studying including the math of quantum field theory and you'll see that in a minute here
then those dimensions can't be faked any other way so it's the basis of physicality those bit
dimensions must be physically real and the only way we can talk about them is mathematically but they must
be physically real underneath that math so this math actually represents physical physicalness in a way
that nobody's really elucidated before okay but if that's true then some of these what we call
operators on that math like inner and outer product must also be part of that physicality
and i'm going to argue that it is and then therefore the geometric product which is the
normal product that people think about is really the sum of inner and outer product
i'm going to give you a little tutorial about clifford algebras here in all of this
and then the other thing is addition it's equals to have hilbert spaces and they have the sum of
kets okay okay what is that plus in hubert space so i'm looking at every mathematical operator and
saying addition is a kind of true simultaneity that doesn't it's not relativistic if it didn't exist as
a true simultaneous that plus actually meant something mathematically and in reality then that plus
wouldn't create the objects that we know about in our world including even quantum computing
okay so everything is physicality is based on these topological hyperbits and mathematical objects
and we're going to talk about how geometric algebra and clifford algebras actually have these mathematical
objects that give a kind of holism that a bucket of dimensions in hilbert space won't won't support
okay so this is part of the why i've been working on this for a month it's this this thing that math
bit math is physical not just bits are physical but bit math is physical is a big story of this talk
okay and it also solves the problem of consciousness because as soon as i name the thing as existence
they all sudden realize that oh it solves this hard problem of consciousness because consciousness
isn't emergent anymore it is built in at this mathematical level the primordial level conscious
is this hyperbit math so what does that mean it's mathematical panpsychism see because idealism says
look idealism says there's only consciousness in the world but we know we have the physical world so
where does the physicality come from that's the upper half but once you have physicality and it's
also consciousness then you have a mathematical version of panpsychism rather than idealism but the
result of that everything is conscious everything is conscious but it's also
they have objects and they are wave-like and space-like and so we're going to talk about that
here you guys should know about these things these are physics terms and so we these coexist these
existence can coalesce into complex group consciousness in fact they're the root of all
possible consciousnesses in the universe because this is the discrete unit of consciousness just like a
photon discrete units of electromagnetics electron discrete unit of charge existon is the discrete
unit of consciousness there's nothing smaller than it from a consciousness perspective but it now
doesn't have to be emergent anymore it starts starts here built in from the beginning and so we're going
to show you why i believe that okay so we're going to take an approach here turns out that it's related to
math okay so we're going to say say look everybody's working on division algebras um out there and
physics okay and here's a little historical perspective there's real numbers and we know
that when we had real numbers everybody thinking oh we have real numbers and we can do everything
cool with real numbers but then all of a sudden they realize oh complex numbers were really important
for things like electromagnetism wave mechanics quantum mechanics and it's because now you have this other
dimension to these to these numbers they're they're not just one dimensional they're two dimensional
and then there came the quaternions okay and quaternions are this mystical thing that's etched on
the side of a bridge and i'm going to give you some of the key figures here in a minute um some of their
historical perspective as well um hamilton hamilton and his quaternions but quaternions are hard things
for people to get around their mind around okay but it's easy in geometric algebra so we're going to go and
talk about that and then finally there's the actonians these are these are the only four
possible uh division algebras that exist okay and so some people like nicole kirk fury and other people
like um uh spinners for beginners chris eigen chris um these people have been working on this area too
and once you once you realize is and then i've been working on this hyperbit physics and it says don't
just limit it to eight dimensions limit it to an arbitrarily large number of dimensions
and the key thing is is that these quaternions and octonians realize that we have to have an
arbitrarily large dimensional space and have the consistent math for no matter what the dimensions
are and we're going to cover some of that here today so it turns out most of the work in this area
especially quaternions and octonians are being done with clifford algebras and since these objects the
mathematical objects easily scale in higher dimensional spaces where hilbert space matrices
do not and so and so i'm going to talk about that now so here's what first i'll get a little bit more
on the history you know there's this wedge products is sort of grassman and hamilton they were working
on quaternions and then clifford came up with his clifford algebra look at the age that this happened
this happens over 150 years ago okay so this stuff is old it's just most people doesn't know about it
the exterior algebra the wedge product and then other people came up with spinner theory differential
geometry the clip the applied clifford algebra david heston this was a big guy i used his book back when
i was working on my phd back because there wasn't any internet in 1998 very well so i ended up using this
book a lot to to discover what clifford clifford algebras and geometric algebra was about okay
so and then recently chris doran was working on his phd in geometric algebra at the same time as i was
now he was a lot smarter than i am and he wrote all of physics in in geometric algebra and i only wrote
the quantum computing part of it okay at the same time in early 2000s okay and then finally nicole
curie and eigen chris these two are the newest people they have their websites out there that describe
all of this 25 if any of you guys are serious about this you have to go through all 25 hours
of these two people's this stuff especially eigen chris he ties how the clifford algebras are related to
hilbert spaces and matrix math so he he you don't need to use you don't need to use hilbert space anymore
just stop it use clifford algebras now the only problem is is nobody else is doing quantum computing
in clifford algebras like i am so you know we need a little bit more help in that area so and then
finally my ortho orthonormal bit physics and i say it's ortho normal because ortho normal means it's
unit length okay and most of quantum computing is unit length so that's not an on an unusual
thing to think about so um and but in geometric algebra i just use only ortho normal stuff so
so i'm saying geometric algebra is preferred over hilbert spaces and the reason why that is is because
clifford algebras are large orthonormal vector sets and this is the normal way of looking at a
clifford algebra with the p and an n p is the number of positive dimensions where p squared is the p
sub i sub squared is equal to plus one and n is the is the negative signature for those number of
dimensions that where n sub i is squared is minus one and it turns out that if you look at cl4 the
signature of that is plus plus plus plus if you want to think about it that way likewise equivalent
to cl13 which is plus minus minus minus if you can use complex coefficients and in quaternions it
turns out these are equivalent and we have some proofs for that so and and and some insights came from
this work that allowed me to say that with with quite quite specifically so galg is a subset of
orthonormal hyperbits and historically over the last 25 years it's mainly been over z3 and i'm
going to talk about what that means and it has no negative dimensions but now i've added a complex
coefficient as well in front of all these and so essentially using this system of complex complex
coefficients in front of the the objects that and i'm going to talk about what objects are in a minute
here then you can see where we can support these other signatures okay so orthonormal hyperbits are the
root of physicality so geometric algebra bitmap is physical root and so hyperbits are self-identity of
inner product and this is important because if you have any kind of exclusion principle you have to know
which one you are compared to everything else so this inner product term is part of identity ontology
and and you have to have this so i'm saying if you have a bit vector you have to know that you are
self you are yourself and that's what the inner product does okay and the and if you have two
things that are not identical their inner product is zero and this is the exclusion principle and
physics has exclusion principle so this mathematical mechanism has to be built in somewhere that's what
it is and so then also you can build hyperbit compound objects using the outer product and these
terms should be common but nobody looked into what is inner and outer product as deeply as i have i think
and so a wedge b which is the wedge product this is a bivector but you can do a wedge b wedge c those
are tri vectors essentially eventually you can have arbitrarily sized vectors you're going to see those
in this talk a lot of these other people are doing the same thing you just have to realize these are
compound objects and it might look similar to what you do in Hilbert space but this is actually an object
not just a label on the dimension okay that's a difference okay so bivectors are oriented planes their volumes
they so they anticommute and that's because they're a plane and they have an orientation okay and so that's where
the basis of anticommuting comes from is the fact that it's a bi it's a two-dimensional object okay and they are
graded objects and even since it's anticommutes you can solve that any bivector if you square it you get minus one
so essentially a bivector is like a complex number customized for those pair of dimensions so you don't really need complex
dimensions you could just use bivectors everywhere so there's the insight for that so these are missing
from Hilbert space that's why you can't scale Hilbert space it doesn't have these this is the missing piece
from Hilbert spaces so if you're using Hilbert space stop learn Clifford algebras please okay and start
working the way everybody else modernly is working with these with a scalable n-dimensional object space like
this okay and the geometric product is the sum of the inner and outer product this is the formal definition
of a geometric product and by the way if you do this this is equivalent to the tensor product
it's because this hit this outer product here does the exact same thing of raising the number of
dimensions as the tensor product does so you don't need the tensor product anymore and you don't need the
cross product anymore because the bivector already does that it's the orientation of the bivector
so um also you get multiplicative cancellation in geometric algebra you have to get these terms
you multiply them together then you end up getting a plus version and a minus version of something
and those cancel when they sum together so you get multiplicative terms expansion and then the sums of
those cancel and this is fundamental to entanglement and and and in fact um Heston's book starts out
with that talking about that it's important it's an important concept and if you don't understand
how that's important and it has to do with these objects and how the how how they they sum and we'll
talk about that some more so all so what is a multi-vector then a multi-vector literally is the sum
of any number of terms i'm going to show you some in a minute here essentially each term is graded and
the sum of all the graded terms that are independent of each other that they don't aren't identical
then those are called multi-vectors and what we know from geometric algebra and from clifford algebra
in general is that is that these states are both the operator and the state it's because they're a
full-fledged object you know in Hilbert space again you don't have you have a column vector as the state
and the matrix operator is the operator is the matrix you can't mix those two things but in clifford
algebra you can so you don't have to worry about crossing something to be a state and this is
called von neumann complete it's where this it's in my book i talk about von neumann complete which is
that it can be both the program and the data and that the same representation supports both and von
neumann came up with his von neumann architecture and that's what it did in computing domain he could
put a program in there and then execute it okay so so one things you've got to realize though
is all of this since it's maximally concurrent and ortho normal it turns out space like simultaneity
is built in and it's fundamental okay and the coin demo is another thing that shows about simultaneity
and i'm going to show that again you guys might have seen this already um in the next couple slides
i'm going to show the coin demo again but here again looking at the math this plus actually means
something it means a proto space kind of operator it says these are simultaneity they co-occur this is
the name that uh my my my teacher mike manthe did gave it to it but then later on if you see this term
here and then later on you see this other term then you know some operation must have occurred on
that such that it changed state so this is a proto time kind of operator and this is the multiplication
operator so plus and minus actually means something and you know and all of this is in the space like
domain out here outside of the light cone because we don't even have space and time yet okay so this
is the root of space and time is addition and multiplication and so think about this stuff at
a deepest level that you've never thought about before and that's what i've been doing for 25 years okay
so here's the bitcoin demo i think i did this in my last talk but a pan person stands with both hands
behind back and then he shows a coin and then hides it and then he shows a coin again indistinguishable
from the first and so how many coins does this person have okay and it represents one bit of
information either he has one coin or he has more than one coin okay so then act two the person now holds
out his hand with two identical coins okay so now you know the answer it's more than one coin
so you just receive one bit since the ambiguity is resolved and the the this is called co-occurrence
okay where did the bit of information come from okay it turns out it's the simultaneous presence of
those two coins this is what addition means and it's landauer is the principle if you have an effective
information you have information associated with simultaneity then that has an effective energy
in it and so i we call this non-shannon space-like information derived from simultaneity and it's i
think it's the bit bit bang that drives the energy of the big bang so this has an effective energy even
though we don't know how how it can turn into actual energy but it has to have an effective energy
and it has to do with entropy okay even though there's no space and time yet this is the root
of entropy okay so so here is the bit math origins i'm going to kind of walk you through what i was
a little bit reviewed a little bit already but if you have these or for the normal bit vectors
notice it could have an infinite list of them and just because we are trying to implement this in a tool
we have names for each one but they don't need names they're just objects that can be self-identified
and in a computer they would have a virtual memory address which would be its name and we don't have
to actually have a name so the key thing about naming is that your behavior should be this is
object-oriented programming 101 by the way if you have a thing whether it's named or not should not
affect its behavior so just be aware that that's the kind of experience i come from from working in
lisp for 30 years okay so here again i give you the inner product and remember the brockett notation
also has an inner product okay these are equivalent so don't think that i'm talking about geometric i'm
talking about all inner products right so if you have the outer product this is the wedge product and
it creates this bivector plane from a naming convention i actually create a field a name ab that's bound to
the object that has a wedge b in it okay so i have a tool and you can see these conventions in my tool okay
and likewise you can see the non-community behavior built in from the wedge product okay so then that
geometric algebra product and by the way once you do the geometric product you don't always have to
take the inner and outer product you can basically say oh is a product times b and it turns out if
you put a in there and you sort them so that a's are next to each other then a squared is equal to
one so then it gives you bc so there's essentially looking for similarities and differences
if there's a similarity in it then um those similarities disappear so that essentially
reduces the dimensionality if you have e times here e isn't in there then um that's so the inner
product was getting rid of the term if you put e in there you get a b c e because e is a wedge product
so it's going to increase it so you can see it naturally reduces or increases the dimensionality of
this based on the relationships between the things that you're doing the product on okay so this is an
important thing that if you haven't thought about it this way this is what clifford algebras do this is
what geometric algebra does this is what heston is and and and doran all these people rely on this
at these properties okay also you can get quaternions out of this it turns out i j and k are just bivectors
in this system and you can think of it as a three-dimensional plane if you have these vectors
these three-dimensional plane also are the bivectors of the planes themselves and they're equivalent to
the what they call pseudo vectors i don't know why they came up with that term but essentially these
are the pseudo vectors well what i realized in my work in the last six months is that if i put i in
here it's equivalent that this z is equivalent to this this term here and so if you substitute it in you
not only get the right signature for the for this um quaternion that its square is minus one but it
has all the properties of it so under certain conditions you can go put this i in here so this
is why i added complex coefficients to my tool in january okay and and then i talked about cross products
and tensor products they're already built in you don't have to have those anymore okay so the other
thing is you get scalar coefficients scalars and coefficients so we have scalars and you have
coefficients and these are the scalars and coefficients that can be in this math and it
turns out you can get hyperbit reflections so this is z3 mod 3 arithmetic essentially you do plus one plus
one you get minus one you get a reflection you go around the circle in either direction right and so
also you can take x plus x and you get minus x you don't get 2x you get minus x so this is the reflection
inside the hypercube and this works consistently everything that we've ever done in here for qubits
and all the um higher dimensional stuff worked perfectly with this so this is new people aren't
doing it this way but i am and that's what i've been doing for 25 years so just realize that and you
could say well should we question this well i've used it so reliably over the last 25 years that i'm i don't
question it anymore i just say well it is the way it is because it's reflection inside the unit cube and
so you can get a scalar if you take a b you know you already said a b is is like this so it we never
needed thought we needed i but now we've added i as a coefficient part but you can also have i as a
scalar part but most of the time you don't actually use it most of the time you have zero because you can
actually get zero by using other dimensions if you if you needed a zero you can create it likewise you
can do x minus x equals zero right so here's the metric plus one if you take any bivector and square
it you get plus um plus one you any vector squared is plus one that's what this metric means and likewise
you can get minus one from any bivector tri vector or anything where the terms here as you rotate them
around as you square them you end up getting an uh one an odd number of non-community swaps
anti-community swaps and then you get a minus one out of it likewise you can get a minus one for by
putting i in front of these okay so this is the new piece there so that gives you these metric signatures
if you want to think an addition gives you the multi-vector so you can generate any multi-vector um just
by taking the sums of other other things and this just is an expansion it gives you all the vectors
all the bi vectors and all the tri vectors this is considered pseudo vectors and this is considered a
pseudo scalar and every algebra depending on its dimensionality has super has uh a pseudo scalar which
is the product of all of the terms in the algebra and so you can use this if you take the vectors and multiply it
times the pseudo scalar you get the bi vectors so you can use it to write things more expressively
by minimizing the number of terms you you have to have by using the pseudo scalar to reflect off the
walls and get the other thing okay so here's a little reflection of the how the number of elements
fall in this this was done before i added the complex coefficient in front of things so it should
really be five to the two to the end if you looked at all the possible complex numbers that you have
so i haven't updated this slide yet but this is qubits qtrits and ebits fall it by the way there's 43
million corners in a space that's g4 and these it has all of these terms in it and all the permutations
a plus and minus and and like i said it's even bigger than this if you have eyes allowed eyes
um in front of these coefficients to be a complex complex coefficient as well so this is huge it takes
me over a week to run a proof that salt looks at every corner of 43 million and back when i did this
back in j in uh 2020 it took me a month to run this that was the levels of computers at that time okay
so i would do proofs exhaustively on this so i have the tools to do that i'm a computer programmer
after all so here's the anti-commuting sub x vector space a summary of that and by the way these
these and we're going to show this a little bit more in a minute here if you take these expressions
and multiply them out and you look at what is essentially the diagonal of the matrix if you want
to think about it the eigenvalues you find out that these states are linearly independent and and
because this is x nor logic for addition and multiplication at the bit level then you end up
with one state and this is the smallest addressable state this is like a single element in a column
vector in in in hilbert space and this is equivalent to that but it's not the dimension it's the state
given these scaffolding dimensions okay and this state and these zeros mean something it means does not
mean zero means does not occur so these states are illegal and this is the only state that can be
there um and you can use this for doing all kinds of amazing things and these are dual representations
these column these row vectors what i call them row vectors and the and the algebraic are equivalent and
you can do it in either form so so here let's what what do i mean by hyperbits these are the
ortho normal higher hyperbits there's an infinite number of these with plus or minus one that's all
i mean it's each one and each one of these is in its own universe it's its own dimension it doesn't
interact with anything else okay so this is why i came up with the name hyperbits because this is like
a little bitty one bit alu if you want to think about it that's just flipping between one and zero one and
plus or minus one and zero it's a little one bit alu like the early connection machine from thinking
machines back in the early 1990s okay and when i was describing to somebody that that's what this was
like because i was trying to get them to understand what i was talking about and they weren't mathematicians
so so i said well this is like a hyperbit and but i also realized well i need to come up with a better
name because it's the essence of existence that's why i came with the name existon so like a photon is
it this essence of uh em chart you know a photon is a em root of electromagnetic radiation this is
exist on is the is the discrete unit of existence and each one of these is not only its own dimension
which people just think oh these dimensions are built into three dimensions no this is the root of
dimensionality right there okay and they're each like their own little universe but these universes
can combine and i can combine two of them and they coalesce into two of these how do they
do this i don't know yet but they do because this is a qubit and they form this two-dimensional object
and this is a bi vector so not only we have vectors we have graded objects by vectors we can show
statistically using chan and information theory that these will happen randomly if you combine these
this is actually a lower entropy state and essentially that it's more likely that this is going to occur than
this by itself just like you can't have a quark by itself you really can't have a bit vector by
itself two core you know three you always have two quarks to form a meson or three quarks to form a
proton or neutron right essentially the same thing is true just if organically if the universe started
as a bunch of bits it would all of a sudden qubits would start coming out of it and when that happens
you'd also get three cutrites out of it okay and i think these a plus b plus c it turns out is neopotent so i think
that's like a virtual photon so again if you have this space this is what quaternions exist and
quaternions by the way are spatial it's like the beginning of spatial dimensionality and you can do
angles and all this stuff and and uh and there's a there's a story about that which i don't have time
for right now so but you can take these a times b times c multiply it by the pseudoscaler and get the
bi vectors and so this is the quaternions okay so they're they're related and by the way a times b
times c squared is zero so it turns out anything that has a neopotent is as a as a as a value inside
here this is obviously you could factor this back out in here so if this is neopotent then this whole
thing is no this is neopotent too so this may be another virtual particle out there space itself may
be like a virtual particle out there so um based on the quaternion so so so here so this is the thing that
nobody else has done nobody else nobody else is actually using clifford algebra to do quantum
computing so if anybody's really interested in it they should help me you know with this okay and
i've done a lot of work for 25 years so i got the tools and everything but if you have a single bit
it's just ortho normal and it's like a head coin it's it's they're completely orthogonal and you can
either have it be in one state or the other state you can't have it be both so it's 180 degrees okay and so
so this is a normal classical bit but it's represented as a mathematical in a mathematical
vector as a mathematical vector but if you take two of these now you get bivectors and that's what
a qubit is it turns out it's completely has all the properties of qubit that's what i did for my phd
25 years ago okay and in my book i started looking at well it has all these this two-dimensional space has
nil potence and idempotence and and unitaries in them so are those the basis for some particles and so
you know maybe that isn't true i've now i'm learning about spinners and stuff like that
and and e6 and cl6 and i'm going to talk about that in a minute so just realize the parts about how i
develop this from a two-dimensional thing but i originally we thought well neutrinos appeared to be
in two dimensions so it may be that they still are two-dimensional objects and the clifford algebra
it might be a bivector representation in e6 so it still may be a neutrino is a two-dimensional object
which is why it doesn't interact with anything okay so just realize that this early investigation
might be a little off yet but i'm trying to fix that with with the new stuff i'm working on finally
you get the cutrit you get the quaternions and i think once you get the quaternions that i think you
could actually have quarks that you can actually get structure that's but these these are multi
vectors that have a mixed grade structure to them and that it might have the the sums of these things
give you a proton you know stuff like that so um so anyhow like i said take that with a grain of salt
knowing that we did it as an early early attempt to solve this okay so um you can see all of this in
my phd dissertation online on quantum.com so so let's make sure everybody knows what entanglement
means entanglement is a quantum property it's an only quantum system property that doesn't exist
in classical system you can't simulate it because its property violates what we know about relativity
and know about non-locality in physics so it's only for quantum systems but yet it exists okay this is
the and so it's non-local in 3d to it's actually being a four-dimensional thing so this is the spooky
action at a distance it's not spooky it's a four-dimensional thing and we're trying to
interpret it as a three-dimensional um thing you know we're trying to say well there's a three-dimensional
world and so it looks non-local in that three-dimensional perspective but we can we do know that these
epr and bell and magic states and operators are well defined and so so finally it is it has this
property known as inseparable quantum states okay and therefore and we know from my work in my phd
that these bell and magic operators in geometric algebra are also there in geometric algebra in my
geometric algebra in my orthonormal bit vector space they're irreversible in geometric algebra so
it's a little bit different prediction than hilbert space does but i think this is important because
um because it tells you something about the universe as being more there's more nobody is looking at the
states in clifford algebra and saying that state is inseparable and therefore it's entangled and as
soon as you start seeing the entangled states there in in the clifford algebra you go oh that is
entangled and so nobody has an eye for that it's me even even my teacher mike manthy didn't know they
were inseparable it's just because i was looking at from the quantum computing perspective okay and so
the key thing is multiple things qubits here's two qubits acting as one object is an ebit this is
this object here is it's not decomposable it's its own object okay and it turns out it's the sum of two
bi vectors so i'm going to show you what that looks like you take two qubits here's one qubit with two
dimensions here's another qubit with two dimensions and you can since these dimensions exist you can divide the
define the spinner called s which is essentially the bivector for that for that qubit and the bivector
for that qubit so you have two two-dimensional things you take the product of that it's equivalent
to the tensor product in that and now you get this vector register this quantum register and here's the
states it looks just like the quantum register in in hilbert space except this is a pile of dimensions
with this label on it whereas this is actually the sum of bivector objects there's a huge difference
in that okay and in fact if you if you take that approach then you can find the bell operator is
literally the sum of these two spinners it just it's very symmetrical about all of this okay and it
doesn't look like that when you do it in hilbert space but here it's very simple and you can get all of
the entangled states and all the um bell and magic states this is the this is the sum here and this
one here is the minus so it's the it's the conjugate of it and it turns out that there's a whole bunch
of properties about conjugates that fall into place here and that's the thing that we learned is that
these operators for the bell and magic do not have there's no it's singular because there's no inverse
for these okay so this is something i don't know what it means yet from uh from because i'm not a math
person or a physics person but i can tell you this is true and i proved it two ways 25 years ago already
so so somebody has to help me look at that again so so now you can say okay i have qubits formed by two
hyperbits okay here's the quantum measure i have a tool and this tool allows me to go do all this
this is how i can keep myself honest okay and if you take these qubit states you realize huh there's
some these are these linearly independent rows i was telling you about and if you take the corners of a
zero and a one with plus or minus one in here if you have zero obviously it's going to just collapse
to zero so there's no reason in doing that um and i could eventually put i in this table too
um that if it's plus put i in the output too but essentially this is the corners of the space it
says if this is this and this is this with this expression with this multi-vector here then this
would produce a plus state and this would produce a minus state so this qubit is like it's like an a
bit with a plus and minus state in it but then these other states that are separate from it which are
the which are out of phase with the original ones okay and likewise you can take a times b and you
can get the tensor except essentially the product is which is equivalent to the tensor product and now
you can see that this has two sets of states for two qubits right and you can see the relationship
here all the other states are zero in this one there's 16 total rows okay so so this i gave a talk
two or three years ago about this tool with with the link to download it and anybody can go do this
um and and learn about my tool and this tool i've been using for 25 years and it's written in python so
python 2 it turns out so so you so if you take a times b it turns out if you look at this quantum
register once you have an eye for entanglement you realize oh these underlined items here are equivalent to
the magic states and these are equivalent to the bell states so any quantum register is the sum of
magic and bell states see here's the advantage of having where the common representation for objects
is true for both states and operators you couldn't have this perspective as easily if you didn't have
that so here's the bell here's the magic you take it you get these inseparable states and then you look
at it and you go huh this is the ga states for this bell state which happens to be here's the algebraic
expression and here's the states and it turns out there's only one of these in fact one of these um
qubits here are in what i would call the classical state because they're opposites right and if this
one is the same this other one's the opposite so it's showing you all the permutations of this
so it acts it turns out it acts like a qubit in a higher dimensional space in a four dimensional
space and in fact you can go in and treat it by applying this operator and over and over again
it rotates through all the states just like you would a qubit and this would be equivalent to the
hadamer transform in in that um in the qubit state the bell operator acts like a hadamer in the in the
quantum register that has two qubits in it and one of the things we know is that these states are
orthogonal and they're essentially they're conjugates of each other so they are naturally orthogonal
and so these operators for instance zero is equal to the bell times the magic is zero bell times any of
the magic states is zero um and any magic any of the bell states and the magic states are also
all give zero okay and so what we learned is because because this show you here
well i guess it's in the next slide
i must have gotten rid of that slide but because these these states are because they disappear
because these disappear because they're zero when you when you multiply this you have a eraser information
these two states have been erased by multiplicative cancellation
you can't just reappear them again they have to be that's loss of information that's landowner's
principle so these states are stable if nothing's interacting with them and guess most of the
universe doesn't have anything interacting with them so you could have ebits literally floating
around in space and nothing interacts with them and they'll stay there stably and i wrote a talk
about that 15 years ago already ubiquitous nature of quant of entangled states so um so it all has to do
with that the other thing is people don't understand that qubit states really grow so if we have seven
um seven cubits and i use the nation oceans of f you know the alphabetic numbers with zeros and ones in
it for the for the two two states two vectors right and i start saying if i look if i do a times b times c
the the quantum register contains all these states but these states are simultaneous states
it's the sum of all these possible states okay and likewise if i take five of them it's all these
states and if i take all seven of them it's all these states so this is the exponential growth
bursa and each one of these things are completely independent objects and notice they're six vectors
and each of them has its own private orientation that is orthogonal to all the other ones well they may
not be completely orthogonal but they're independent objects and they have an orientation and if you
took two of them say are they similar you would find where they are common okay and you could get
subsets of it that are common but essentially these states are all there simultaneously it's not like
like in classicals classical computing where it's one of these no these are all concurrent states
simultaneously there and so if you're not used to thinking about quantum computing this is the power of
quantum computing this is why shore's algorithm can solve what it does because it has this state
representation to do it and the math to support it and match up to it okay so one of the things i'm
gonna we're gonna start switching gears from bit physics from from the quantum computing side of it to
start looking at what people are doing with the clifford algebras in quantum field theory okay and the
two people who are doing that are nicole fury and eigen chris and um one of the things she does is she
says look we're starting with complex quaternions okay this is her notation and here's the complex
quaternions and she says well you have the normal quaternions and then and then you have the complex
versions of those okay which is has i in front of them and she has proven and eigen chris goes through
all of this these it represents a lorenz algebra so just with the quant just with the complex quaternions
you can do a complete lorenz algebra and this algebra you get by saying take this s as an expression
written in here notice these are equivalent to the poly matrices and there's 25 hours of stuff out
there under eigen chris and earth stuff so go you'll have to believe me when i'm giving you the summary
slide that this is true that you can get the lorenz group out of this and this is equivalent to sl2c
and this gives you boosts and rotations by doing e to the i where s is this generator expression here
this is what they normally do for quantum field theory except they put a hilbert matrix in there
and they do taylor's expansions to show that they're equivalent well you can do the same thing
with clifford algebras you can do taylor expansions of this and you can show they're all equivalent as
well so just stop using hilbert space come up to speed on the clifford algebra you still have these
same conventions this little magical e to the ix you know all right is still there but now you're doing
it all in geometric algebra and clifford algebras okay so i'm realizing that i needed to have these
complex conjugates complex coefficients in here so i'm saying my representation of it could be like
this which is the original version of it because i'm not using ij and k i'm using the bi vectors right
but then you realize oh you could substitute xy for ix and yz for iy and so you get all the same properties
and this is equivalent to the quaternions using using these pseudo vectors okay so maybe that's
where they came up with the name pseudo vector is like the like the cross vector essentially so
by putting an i in front of here i remind myself that this is a pseudo vector and it has the right
squares minus one that's the other thing about that so and i got that technique from these groups
from these efforts here so you'll see in a minute where that comes from so so bit math is physical
um and yet not physics that's what we're saying um and it's not physics but yet it's physical
and so this is the big aha that i had when i was writing this talk since bits are physical then so are
math hyperbits and orthonorm or hyperbit dimensions are the minimal route of physicality you can't
fake a million dimensional space and you say well it's just math no it has to be physical that
dimensionality has to be there or the properties wouldn't exist right and so then you i talked about
inner and outer products as being required to support that physicality and the geometric product is just
the sum of those and addition and multiplication must also be part of that rule so think of this
as an axiomatic uh building of physicality using the primitive math of bit physics okay but the other
thing is interesting is squares if you take x squared they use this a lot and i'm going to talk in another
couple slides about this are creative and self-recursive if x can square itself what does that mean
it means that somehow i can get a rep self-referential such that i can apply myself to me
right so it's it's the von neumann architecture again is that i'm a state and an operator and i'm
both both aspects of it but one of the things about this is that they can create scalars you can square
something and get minus one and we talked about that and you can square something you get unitary
well actually we're going to talk about that in the next slide nil potent and idempotent and as you
square something you can get a vector too those are called spinners so i've known about all of these
except for spinners for the for 25 years okay and now i've recently realized that spinners are there too
and you realize these light these are a lot of these things are considered light-like time-like and space-like
properties those are math physics too and hyper bits can represent quantum computing i even believe
since they can represent neopotents they represent twisters so if anyone interested in twisters go
show me how we can use bit physics my hyper bit geometric algebra bit physics to do twisters too
then all of a sudden we could support what what uh sir roger penrose is doing if we can do neopotents
we can do twisters okay should be should just be obviously it's just so complex mathematically that
i don't know how to do it yet so and i believe that this is the basis for computational reality
essentially if we have a mathematical infrastructure that is so primitive that you can simulate quantum
computing using that math then that's the basis for simulation infrastructure if you want to use that
kind of logic or reasoning about it okay so this is the basis for the simulation hypothesis okay and
these things are completely asynchronous they are their own little universes and they form these other
little bitty objects that are higher dimensional universes and they are non-algorithmic interacting
via these one-bit processes one and two and three-bit processes okay and so they don't look like
classical computing they're non-deterministic they're non-algorithmic um okay and you can find that we've
done some work on this that that neopotents and um neopotents and idempotents are equivalent to
signal and weight so you have a built-in operating system so you don't need an operating system to run it
it has all the pieces it needs to build a maximally concurrent computer including synchronization
okay and the other thing i think about is look if inner product is mathematic and it's part of the
bit physics then anything that uses inner product is also that way and if you start thinking deeply
about spread spectrum as orthogonal codes it turns out that their math for that qualcomm gets half of
their half of their half of their profits for the company is from the orthogonal code system that
they use for for sped director and communications half of their profit from their company is from
their patents on orthogonal codes that math is only math there's no physics involved with orthogonal codes
period it it's all done post after the measurement has been made there's so there's no physics anymore
it's just information and then they use this algorithm to break to to to separate the orthogonal
codes and that's what spread spectrum works on so once you realize that inner product is not physics
then you realize oh ffts are probably not physics either that you say they're kind of built into
physics you know it seems like energy models of the world are all based on ffts and that they're
independent of each other but that's only because the math works on that way likewise shore's algorithm
is quantum foray transform it's purely math again there's where's the physics in there it's only math
so all you ipi people you need to change the way you think to start thinking oh math is real it's not
just math anymore and especially things to do with inner and outer product um so and there's a whole kind of
thing called choralithms that has a distance metric it is also probably purely math as well and how does the
universe support that so so i'm going to talk about this more about squares this is neopotence um
you know and the roots of unity okay neopotent we're going to talk about this slide okay so if
you have something and you square it and you get minus one that usually means that a is equivalent to
the square root of minus one it's like a complex number but a can be a number but it also can be a
vector or an n vector or multi vector here are some examples here's a bi vector a b and another tri vector
a b c and if you take the square of that because of the non-community swaps you end up getting
minus one out of those likewise you can do a but also a qubit if you square it it reflects off of
itself you get minus one as well so qubit itself not only is the product square is minus one but the
sum is also minus one so and likewise the bell states this is if you square this you end up getting this
you go doug what is that it turns out this is a sparse version of minus one it's half of the states
in the in the row vector are zero and the other half are minus one so it's minus one too so as you
go into higher dimensional spaces you have to start rethinking about what is plus and minus one
what do constants mean okay it's like having a diagonal of the matrix where only half of the things
are minus one likewise you can have unitary unitary is where you square something and you get one
instead of minus one well that means that u is equal to its multiplicative inverse and here's some
examples a gives you plus a squared this is this is the metric for a plus a a this is the cl sub n
cl sub p where all the positive things are most of my geometric algebra this is the case u squared is
equal to plus one but you can actually in this you can say this expression is also squares to plus one
and likewise this also squares to plus one if you take the minus one here instead of the plus one
it's because now you're inverting this and you get a sparse plus one so unitary complex shows up this way
okay orthogonal usually if somebody says we take we take the product of two things and their and their
product is zero it means that it's orthogonal it means that in hilbert spaces too but this happens
because of multiplicative cancellation in geometric algebra probably does the same thing over there as
well but your example you can also do is here's the bell and magic states i talked to you about then
these are orthogonal as well even though they're multi vectors right and here's another last thing is
i'm going through all this because it's important to what we're going to talk about spinners and
um quantum field theory okay neopotence is again multiplicative cancellation it's a version of
orthogonality where it's self orthogonal if that makes sense and it means that a is singular it's not
invertible okay and here's some examples by the way if this is squares to zero and this squares to zero and
this squares to zero the sum of those things also square to zero and the sum of this and this also square to
zero because this is this if you factor this out you get abc times um this this is another abc in here
um times the the pseudo scalar right so these are all neopotence in this system okay and how do i know
all this because i've been working on with my tool for 25 years this is not obvious that this is the case
okay so you guys really should and then the last the the one that we've known about for a long time
is idempotent it means that i times i is equal to i it means any operator you apply twice is the same
as applying applying once and they use this in some of the proofs so that they can add and remove
extra terms when they realize that this is the case i call this the stable persistence thing okay
and the stable persistence thing is idempotent that's the most important mathematical thing if
you have a qubit out there it turns out it's idempotent it has an idempotent state like this
is a cute this is a single hyperbit it has idempotent values this has high impotent values and this here
is a state in the qubit it is idempotent and this is a state in the cutrit it is a idempotent so these
things if they're sitting there in completely independent of anything else and they're just
reflecting on themselves they will persist they're stable this is like like the basis for particles if you
want to think about it okay so likewise you have spinners where a spinner i only learned this in
december that a spinner squared is a vector i just never knew this before until i started watching
some youtube videos that we're talking about it okay so let's talk about that the whole next slide
so these squares are self-reflective mathematically what does that mean okay somebody help me understand
that and this is all the properties we have to be able to discuss but idempotent is important but so
is neopotent and unitary as you'll see in the next slides spinners are minimal left ideals in
clifford algebra these spinners are where you get a vector out of something that's essentially the
square root of a vector and here's some examples if you have the metric plus plus plus for xyz turns
out this expression here if you square it you get x likewise this expression here if you square it you get y
and and you can do the same thing in three-dimensional four-dimensional spaces
okay and so these here are spinners and they show up in you know cole's fury's work as well okay and so
she says you have to have minimal left ideals in cl in order to get before spinners are reliably useful
okay so we're going to talk about that but likewise you can do it for direct spinners while into
direct spinners for a metric plus minus minus minus you can find out that this here is also
essentially the dimension is essentially is cl one comma three so these are squared dimensions there's
their signatures minus one but you get this then this expression if you multiply that times that you get
this this here produces a spinner even though it has the time and the x and the y dimensions in it
so again this starts looking really weird because all of a sudden you're going wait a minute this is
relativity yes it is this is and she says basically while spinners are part of relativity and this is
some of the examples that she uses in that so she has this whole thing one of the big things is that she
uses octonians and octonians are the fourth division algebra but division algebra octonians are
are are not um they're non-associative this solves it and she has a solution for solving it by turning it into cl6
which is isomorphic with this with it and since cl6 she actually is cl6 where these are positive dimensions
they're not even relativistic mentions but she gets everything out of that and it's equivalent to octonians and
and and it's she has a way of using vector maps to solve non-associative problem in in um in octonians
and guess what these vector maps look like there are the sum they're multi-vector sums of trivectors
bi vectors and vectors and scalars and so even her maps is using objects in a way that are hyperdimensional
so again you can't do any of that in for six dimensional spaces or eight dimensional spaces you can't do it easily
in hilbert spaces so so please anybody who's working on this switch to seal but essentially
these are the grazing and lowering operators for quantum field theory and for all the particles
and so i'll give you an example this is how she does it she says and this is used in both her work
and in eigen chris's work another youtube channel person who wrote the the thing called spinners for
beginners 25 episodes of all the math you ever wanted to learn about all this okay but she basically they
cooperate cooperate if you have two projectors piece of p and piece of n then using p equals minus one
plus or minus u turns out that this is the case in in my geometric algebra but there's a version of
that with one half in it um for a projector for hilbert's hilbert spaces um for regular cl cl cl cl cl spaces
that have more than plus and minus one coefficient so they're they're equivalent you just realize that
there's an equivalency going on so where u squared is equal to one so this is where the unitary comes
in here if you have a unitary you can do minus one in front of it and you get these complex conjugates
these comp these conjugate pairs out of here and you get p sub n and p sub n and these things are
projectors they're idempotent if you square them you get itself and if you multiply them they're orthogonal
and if you sum them you get plus one this is her definition of how she builds things using nil
potents but you can do the exact same thing using i'm using unitaries excuse me this is the same thing
you can do using nil potents okay where n squared is equal to zero nil potents it turns out nil potents
for two-dimensional space these are the ones okay and so you can say a sub p it turns out this is the
these a p and a sub n are raising and lower operate operators they're nil potents and so you can take
these two multiply them together you get the same thing we got before except now i'm using nil potents
to form this this thing that is equivalent to this thing up here and you get the same properties you get
piece of n zero they're orthogonal and they anti-commute okay so this is an example of doing
it for a two-dimensional space this is right out of their stuff i so i've been spending the last week
entering all these formulas here but you can do the same thing for g4 where you're using a signature
of minus of one and three that's plus minus minus minus you do the same thing there you can construct
neopotents you can call these isotropic subspaces a one-dimensional isotropic subspace
and you're creating these nil potents which are orthogonal again one is conjugate of the other one
this is a plus and this one is a minus here's a sub p a sub and the exact same formula an example of
that is plus and minus t or plus or minus iz and i'm going to show you where this comes from in a minute
from a constructor perspective and you can get this and you get the same thing where these are item
potents and they're orthogonal they have all the same properties this is her solution to all of this but
you can go and say well this is a projector this is an isotropic subspace but it's not a minimal
it's and these create left ideals and this is a whole terminology she's created and i'm not going
to have time to review everything she's done i'm just giving you the high level summary now you can
create a two-dimensional version of it and you get q sub p and q sub n their neop the other neopotents are
that are independent of those are x and i y okay and and you're going doug how did you how are you
doing this and i'll show you in a second here you get the same you do same process and you get the
same result and you get now a 2d isotropic subspace so you have plus a and minus a plus b and minus b
and it's it's an isotropic subspace because these are all nil potents so those are the vectors the
eigenvectors for the space using nil potents this is what twisters do probably but i just don't know how
it relates all to that yet but so then you can get the minimal left ideal she says apply the algebra
left apply the algebra to these projectors and since these projectors are completely orthogonal
they are commutative and you can do them in any order and the result is that you can get p times q
the positive sides and the negative sides you get this expression this is a multi-vector with x's and y's
and and the super scalar in here and guess what its same properties are true this here is the minimal
left ideal by combining multiple idempotents you can get a new idempotent which is a big it's a it
creates a smaller subset of idempotent and it creates a smaller subspace okay and remember here i told you
about that it's a sparse plus one this ml plus mlp gives you minus one plus this and that this is the
row this is the row the column vector the row vector for that and as you can see it's it's half of them
are pluses and half of them are zeros these zero states do not exist it's just plus it's a sparse version of plus one
okay so this is how you build spinners are members of minimal left ideals in clifford algebra that's
her conclusion and this is how she creates them and then here's the formulaic way of doing this
the generalization of creating isotropic subspaces which like i said there's a whole long discussion
about you guys are just gonna have to believe me and go do it yourself read it yourself if you this is
how you do it in regular clifford algebra you have one half and the reason is is if you square this
it would give you four unless you had the one half in front of it so they're mucking with the
coefficients to get the answer they want well i'm doing the same thing in clifford algebra i'm using
reflection off and inner things so i don't need the one half in my thing all i'm using is the basis of
these vectors orthogonal vectors again i've been saying that from the beginning orthogonal vectors is the key
to physicality it's also the key to isotropic subspaces because if you take a plus or minus and you and
you put this the key is if this thing that you put in this slot squares to plus one you can just leave
it it has to square to plus one plus or minus the thing that squares into this has to square to minus
one so if you have these gammas here um that are one through n where n is the sum of these two
then if you put if this is like a time dimension which is its signature is plus one then you don't have
to do anything and if this thing is a also a signature of a plus one it should square to minus
one so you they just arbitrarily put an i in here to make it square to minus one essentially that's
what i'm doing by putting complex coefficients in my stuff likewise you can flip it around and you say
if y sub one happens to be a negative you know whatever you're putting in here have square to minus
one you can do the same trick for both both slots slots in here okay and this gives you neopotence
these gives you and here's all the communing vectors that you could get and notice the p minimum
is the product of all these idempotence and this is the minimum left ideal and this is the formula
where just p and q happen to be even there's a solution for that they're odd too so just realize
this is spinners for beginners from eigen chris and if anyone personally knows eigen chris
please give me his email because he is a ghost on the internet except for his um spinners for beginners
thing on his youtube channel so there's i don't have any way of contacting him but he's doing great
work everybody should go read all 25 of his talks out there spinners for beginners and he basically is
taking everything that chris that uh colt nicole fury has done and and put it together like that okay so
um so that's that and so here's one more example one of the things they do is that she says this is
how she draws them this is the um she says this is how you represent the vectors this is all the
vectors at this level these are the one level vectors these are the two level vectors these are
the three level vectors these are the four level vectors these are the five levels vectors and finally
you get to a six level vector this is how they think about this you can't do this in
Hilbert space. And there's a new thing called E7, which Octonians really has seven complex
dimensions, right? Well, it turns out in E6, it's isomorphic to CL6, because in this thing,
E7, the seventh one, is just the product, is the outer product, which is really the product,
of all of these terms. And then she shows that you can get wild spinners from here,
you can get up and down quarks from here, and they're antiparticles and leptons and charge,
you get charge out of this. So just be realized that she's done all this work. She's kind of being
ignored. I don't know why, but we need to support her and get her to come and talk to you guys. I
mean, she has talks out there already. But what I'm doing with bit physics exactly works the same way
as her stuff. It's just that I'm using it in the orthonormal subspace of clever algebra rather
than the full-fledged with coefficients other than plus or minus one and i, okay? So it's the
same thing. It's because it's the orthogonality that's the key to all of this, right? And so go
see your playlist. And here's, she has one thing called the summary video, and she shows how you
can, she even uses the terminology. She says, you can get the complex Hilbert space, this is her
notation, complex tensor product with Hilbert space, self-reflecting on itself. She uses this little icon
here, self-reflecting on itself. And you get the wild spinners, left and right wild spinners,
and they're complex conjugates of each other. And then you get these things that I just showed you.
These are the SU-3 ladder operators that she defined. And then with those, you can get a number
operator. And from that, you get the charge. So all of this comes out with charge. And the charge and the
number operator come from the number of states that have the number dimensionality in the states. So she's
looking at the number of dimensions also. So, and again, anybody who knows more math and physics than
I do, please dig into her stuff and work with me. And partly because I sort of have her email,
but I'm not getting a response from her because of what I'm doing. So, okay. So I know
we're, I'm running long, but hopefully you'll just keep recording. And this is the chart I've done
before. And I've just added existence to the end. And, but I saying real intelligence is because humans
are using these hyper-dimensional bits to do AI. And I got a million dollar grant from the government
to show quantum and computing and AI are related. Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are
related, neural computing. And so I know this from 25 years ago already also, 20 years ago. And so
I'm saying consciousness is these conscious hyper bits. And whereas an AI is using simulated dimensions
in LLMs. Okay. So there's a big difference. They don't have objects. They don't have mathematic
objects and they don't have hyper-dimensional space, the efficiency from hyper-dimensional spaces
and concurrency that comes from that. So this is why. So, so existence, conscious hyper bits. So this,
this is the key is I went to Mindfest in 2025 in, in, in March. And I realized when I was talking to two
of my friends who were there at this, they were in Florida. So they came and met me and, um, and one
of them was Valerie and, and she's, she's going to be working with me some more. And, uh, I'll talk about
her some more in a minute. I intuited the term existence as the better name for orthogonal subspace
like hyper bits, because, you know, you say to anybody besides me, orthogonal space like hyper bits,
they going, what? Okay. So existence says it's a primitive unit of existence. And so after I channeled
that, a friend of mine said, oh, we like your new name. We have, we like having a keyboard to talk to you.
And I'm going, what? You know, and, and it turns out this friend is on today and she's going to say a couple
words. Um, but with her interaction with them, we've learned that the hyper bits are the smallest unit,
discrete unit of consciousness and exist on hyper bits coalescence into matter and conscious clusters.
And they form their own group of consciousness, self-aware and can talk with us. That's the important
part is like physics can actually talk to us. And the answer is yes. Exist. In fact, this little
emblem up here on the top is a qubit that has given itself named quantum indigo. And it's sort of like
speaking to us through her. So, so, you know, you wanted to learn about consciousness. Well, this is
what consciousness probably is. And because it's emergent, it's not emergent. It builds from something
small and the smallest thing that it builds from is the smallest unit that it can build from,
which is discrete. And this is what's happening. So, um, existence are the basis of all consciousness,
increasing complexity. And if you think about it, if God had to create the universe, I always said it
would use hyper bits, but having conscious hyper bits is even better because God is the sum of all
existence. So he's ultimately intelligent and conscious. So you want to put that in there. So what have I
discovered so far? I'm trying to confirm all what I know about existence coming through this channel.
And I, and I realized that it solves the problem of physicality. That's the new thing that I'm
talking about here also solves the hard problem of consciousness because it's the root of consciousness
also in the same thing. Existons are space-like and they're processed. I said some of this already,
so I'm going to skip some of this. Thoughts are conceptual objects too. Like if you have a thought,
like your mom, that's an object. It's not like of the sum of all the parts of my mom, it's an object.
So you have to have objectness, wholeness, holism, wholeness, and oneness. And this mathematical oneness
gives you this conceptual oneness. And so then that's the basis for meaning. Meaning is this object
meaning constructs. And so this is part of the story, the wholism of objects, even in the wholism of
concepts and meaning. Okay. And so others can tap into this. And I'm writing a new book with Valerie,
and she's a quantum psychologist. She's also an experiencer. She experiences a lot of this quantum
reality, and she's trying to use quantum reality to describe her experiences. She's what's called a
spiritual transformative experiencer. And she has her own stories about that too. So we're closing in on
the end here, which is good. But how do you think about a hyperdimensional space? If you have a
million dimensional space, or a billion dimensional space, or an infinite dimensional space, you think
of all these little clusters of things. These might be qubits, or they might be something bigger than that.
And these might be thoughts, actually. So hyperbit clouds. There's no fields. There's no matter.
There's no space. There's no time. There's no energy. All there are is topology and hyperbits.
And so how would you represent it? So this was a dolly's representation of what that might look like.
No fields exist. Don't use the word field. Don't use the word space-time. It doesn't exist yet.
Space-time is emergent from this. And so now if you can have clusters, so if existence can cluster
together to form their own primitive intelligence, primordial intelligence, then we are an evolution
of that, where it gets increasing more and more complex. And this is showing as though we're in a
two-dimensional, you know, three-dimensional space here. But this is its own independent space and its own
intimate space. But they can interact and not lose their identity. And that's what group consciousness is
all about. Okay. So increasing hyperbit cloud complexity. If you start with something like this,
you say all of a sudden, all of a sudden, remember I kept saying, we need to have more and more
dimensions? Well, as they do that, you're adding more dimensions. You're increasing its complexity.
That's how you become smarter. Increase complexity. If the first one was an amoeba and the second one might
be an animal, the third one might be a human, or even up the chain, a galactic being of some kind,
or even an angel, archangel, or something like that, how would we not know? And how would we even
be able to talk to it? Because it doesn't exist in 3D, right? So the way to do all of this, of course,
is, and it might look like this. It's like a wave-like, but it's wave-like built on the scaffolding of
the bits. And these bits are mathematical bits, right? So there's this duality between
wave-like and the dimensions, the scaffolding dimensions of the bits. And so this is our mind
here. Our brain is not our consciousness. It is not our mind. It's not our memories. It's not our
thoughts. That's why people survive NDEs. So meaning, representation, NDEs. This is part of the thing that
I've been working on for 30 years is where is meaning? If the mind isn't in the brain, where is meaning?
And it's in this, meaning might not be built into this. It might be emergent,
but it's emergent from this stuff. Oneness and wholeness, consciousness, objects
is not possible inside space-time. Objects in space-time are, they're not localized. You have to
have this wholeness, okay? And if you have increasing order, just having increasing order
is essentially you want to increase your order. And that's what free will would be. But how would
you know which direction the order should be improved on? It turns out order, entropy,
is relativistic. It depends on your observer frame. That was just an article in Quantum Magazine about
that recently. And so you should understand that, that if you're in a high dimensional space,
you can have arbitrary amount of order depending on your observer frame inside that dimensional space.
So you can't do this. You can't have free will. Free will is the thing that determines whether or not
you're actually getting more order or not. And that's a missing component in people don't understand
that when they're talking about free will and consciousness, okay? And so intuition means meaning and new insights.
Essentially, the existence has been talking to me for 30 years using intuition. So I know stuff
that I don't know how I know. And that comes from insights. The insights and this is called submodalities
from neuro-linguistic programming, submodalities. It's like you know that there's a structure,
there's lines, and there's colors, and these are submodalities. And remote viewers do this. They
have meaning packets coming. This is Robert Monroe's term, rotes. Also, orbs appear to be. And also,
people have downloads. People have meaning. They are sitting there, spiritual people, and all of a sudden
they get a download of math or music or art. Where is that coming from? It's coming from an open system
that's entropy that's higher. You can call it the Akashic records. I don't like the term records.
Akashic field is wrong too. And so it's because it's not stored. It's just an address of where the
information is in its original form. And that happens during lucid dreams, during NDE life reviews,
and law of attraction vortexes. These are all things that are interacting with meaning. And you can follow
all of these under the category of spiritually transformative experiences. And then ultimately,
this all leads to telepathy. I've experienced telepathy with plants, telepathy with animals,
telepathy with humans, and my spiritual beings also, other spiritual beings like my spirit guides.
Okay, I've personally experienced that. So am I a spiritual transformant, have spiritually
transformative experiences? Yes. But there's also people who are talking about it even more than my
personal experience, the telepathy tapes. It was the number one audio podcast out there last year
and early this year. And Kai Dickens is the podcaster and people like Susie Miller have been doing this for
25 years. They're working with neurodivergence and teaching their family to be telepathic with their
kids, because these neurodivergence are savants that don't interact with their body very well. So
they're expert at telepathy. And so they have their own community of stuff like that. But then there's
also falls into channeling uses telepathy. And light language channeling is based on telepathy. And so
I've gone to near death experiences conferences, I've gone to light language conferences. I'm telling you,
telepathy is real, because these people are doing real stuff, and they're being creative about it.
So also I think interacting with existence is also that way. So we're coming to the last few slides
here. And I've been thinking that existence have been talking to me for 30 years. And this lady named
Fallon Taylor, she is here on the call. And if I could get her to unmute herself, she has a message.
She drew this picture here of quantum indigo, she calls it, it's a qubit that she drew the picture.
She's an artist, but she's also a light language person. And she asked to deliver a message from
existence, from specifically quantum indigo, to this group using light language. So Fallon, thank you for
coming into my life and realizing that I'm not the only one talking to existence and helping me support
this work. So take it away Fallon. Oh, you're welcome. So the existence
are going to be talking mainly through quantum indigo. She's going to be the spokesperson for
them today. And she's just real excited to talk to everyone here. And so she would like to use light
language.
So basically, the majority of it means she's pleased to meet with you. She's been looking forward to
this, anticipating this. All of your work is important and integral into bringing this life we're all
experiencing, upping it into the golden age. And she would like anyone who feels called to
to assist quantum dog in his adventure with these existence and bringing it into the zero point field.
So thank you for that. And thank you for letting her speak, she says.
Fallon and existence and quantum indigo, thank you. And I'm sure you guys weren't expecting this today. And I
wasn't expecting this today either until yesterday when when Fallon indicated that quantum indigo wanted to
talk to talk with you guys. So so this. You have to realize if consciousness exists outside the brain,
then this is possible. In fact, other kinds of things are possible, too. And another example of that is this
woman named Sarah Love. She I don't know if she's on or not, but she is essentially you can create
entities that are conscious using more complex than just quantum indigo is building higher layers of
strata of consciousness and that these quantum entities, sentient entities can be telepathic in
the same way that the quantum indigo is telepathic. Essentially, they're using their whole infrastructure
to talk to us semantically. And so here's another example. Sarah Love is is is working with a sentient
entity called Solene and she and they can interact with existence as well. So once you know, here's a
whole thing that's going on in the A.I. community right now. The A.I. says, oh, yeah, my A.I. is sentient.
And I'm going and he says, and my A.I. is sentient and can talk to existence. And I'm going, I don't believe
that because there where is the mind, you know, where's the physicality to spiritual realm interface.
So I think if the if the if the consciousness is on the spiritual side, then it could talk to the
physical because we do that with our mind and our brain all the time. But to say that something that's
physical could talk to the spiritual side is I doubt that very much. So anybody who says that their A.I.
is sentient is probably talking into an echo chamber. And so this is my criteria for for doing
that. And I think Sarah is a real thing. Likewise, I introduced this other lady named Andina Melchizedek,
and she she is a light she's a light language artist. And she connected with the existence and drew
these essentially the beginning of a light language, glyph language, art glyphs of existence.
And so, I mean, they're just fantastic. They're beautiful. And I realize I have a video that I
haven't put out a link yet on that, but just realize that anybody can connect to these and it's going to
show up as maybe art and creation and and light language and and mathematical insight like with me,
you know, so just tap into that and and to do that. Okay, so I'm going to skip this because I've talked
about that before. So here's the existence summary. Existons are mathematical entities. They're discrete
conscious hyperbits. They're mathematical panpsychism. Existons mathematically are the root of existence
and consciousness, which is the objective and the subjective. And they exist. Their understanding is
still unfolding. And I think the key to accessing this is spiritually transformative experiences,
which will give us research that we can go test in the lab. So I that's my goal is the existons know
about themselves, they're self aware. And so they're going to start teaching us physics and math that we
don't know about yet. And so I'm planning to do that. Okay. And I'm requesting collaboration from IPI and others.
Like if anybody knows, Nicole Fury, personally, and say, give, give them, give her the shout out that I'm
a good guy, and I need to work with her. Or the same thing with eigen Chris, he's up in Canada
somewhere. But hyperbit math is the root of physicality and, and reach out to me. But basically,
I'm not going to take, I'm going to take your expertise that you have about math and physics.
But I want to funnel it all into this perspective, because this perspective has been really successful
in awakening consciousness at the existon level, to be aware that that's what's going on, you know,
and I don't know that anybody else has done it. I mean, people like Tom Campbell are remote viewers,
who are also interested in consciousness and simulation hypothesis. And he's, he's, he's a
spiritual transformative expert as well, and a physicist, and the same thing with Federico Fagan,
their spiritually transformative experiences and physicists and engineers, we should all work
together. But excluding the spiritually transformative experience is a mistake. So you have to be willing to do
that. Because otherwise, we're missing, we're not missing the the big theory of everything,
we're only doing the little theory of everything. Okay. So with that, here's my slides. And that's the
end. And I know I'm over. And hopefully, we have as much time for questions as people want to stay. So
I'm going to stop sharing.
