ilia setzkova the former co-founder of open ai and their chief scientist arguably one of the
most brilliant minds they've ever had on staff came out of hiding and made a rare public appearance
on friday december 13th at a conference in vancouver called the conference on neural
information processing systems i feel like i say this in almost every youtube video now but
what he shared is absolutely mind-blowing and no that's not clickbait and that's not an exaggeration
in his talk he declared that we are at the end of an era and what comes next is gonna change
everything i've listened to the talk i've listened and watched several youtube breakdowns about the
talk for me these are some of the highlights you're gonna hear them in this video first i want to take
a second to address something there is a growing disbelief i have noticed on almost every
platform i'm on from x to linkedin to right here on youtube especially since one of my recent videos
about google's quantum chip hit over 200 000 views in just a few days and it seemed to attract a lot
of people that simply don't believe this is happening they don't believe that we've tapped
into the multiverse they don't believe in parallel universes they think that asi is a gimmick of an
idea we will never see in our lifetime and let me tell you i'm going to make a very bold prediction
if you don't like it you can turn off my youtube channel forever i'm going to predict right here and
now that everything you hear from me and these top experts i quote from ray kurzweil to ilia sesgover
to dario amade to sam altman literally everyone notable in the ai field right now as i've studied
all their talks all their stage appearances all their podcast interviews they're all lining up
and the one prediction i'm going to make is that everything ilia and other minds like his
are talking about that will happen absolutely will come true and yes that means that parallel
universes are real just because you don't understand something or you don't see it in front of you that
doesn't mean it's not true i mean if you literally believed that then you probably shouldn't believe
i'm real because you haven't physically met me how about any of those zoom or google meets you've had
over the last few weeks are any of those people real just because you can't see touch feel interact
physically with something it doesn't mean it's not real because i strongly believe that everything
these brilliant minds are talking about will come true every single statement made about google's
quantum chip is a massive breakthrough for humanity if we have in fact stabilized qubits and we have the
proof is in the quantum chip being released for commercial use for people to still deny that agi is a
hair's breadth away asi is right beyond it and my belief is that we will see agi in our lifetime and
possibly asi too my other belief is that agi might already be here it's just in slow release so again
i urge you to turn off these channels turn off the internet and just put your head in a hole if you want
to stick to a very narrow belief that none of this will come true i have spent i can't tell you how many
hours not just watching the top youtube videos reading the top articles as they release listening to the
keynotes by these top tech founders but also reading foundational books books like abundance by peter
diamandis a revolutionary look at how the world works and how it is despite humanity's often unnecessarily
pessimistic point of view well the world works positively and it works in abundance and i believe
the technological advancements coming our way mark the dawn of the greatest era of abundance we have ever
lived in think infinite resources at our fingertips that we never have to labor for we can turn our
thoughts into reality with just a single text prompt and with what ilia identified that is coming that we
will see in our lifetime yeah amazing things are on the way i have such a strong belief that this is coming
in our lifetime that we will see things like free and abundant energy by the year 2030 i would stake my
life on it at this point and i know that's an incredibly bold statement but i say that in the
hopes that some of the pessimistic narrow point of view followers that come my way will open up a little
to the possibilities of what are advancing towards us whether we're ready for it or not and just because
something doesn't work today the way you would expect it to work in the age of asi that doesn't
mean the asi isn't just around the corner all right so that was a bit of a rabbit hole so let's go
back to the other rabbit hole which is the topic of today's video what ilia setsuver is saying about
the future of what's coming our way a few of the key revelations i'm going to point out from his talk are how we've
hit something called quote peak data end of quote and what this means for ai development and no it
doesn't mean we're facing an insurmountable wall you gotta hear what he says about it i'm gonna share
it with you also he talks about how future ai will be radically different from anything we have today
and why super intelligent ai an ai that can reason better than a human i'm talking genuine reasoning not
just simulated machine-like reasoning which is what we have now but real authentic reasoning that
surpasses a human brain well ilia talks about how that's going to be unpredictable in ways we can't
even imagine that is a great point to highlight also why current ai is just scratching the surface
of what's to come and no one that i can find except one or two articles here and there has highlighted
what ilia said about crypto in his talk at vancouver so you're going to hear all of that in this video
but first who is ilia setsuver a very quick 30 second overview for those of you not super familiar
ilia is i believe one of the brightest minds ai has ever seen why because back in 2012 ilia co-authored
something called alex net he wrote the groundbreaking paper introducing this what is alex net a
convolutional neural network and it's significantly advanced what we have today in ai it was the first
major demonstration of the capabilities of deep learning and it sparked widespread interest in what
a neural network even was he also co-developed significant architecture which revolutionized nlp itself
nlp is natural language processing and his work has directly touched and impacted the field
of generative ai as a whole where from a simple line of text we can have image video audio etc
ilia left openai in the spring of 2024 to start his own company which is valued at over a billion
dollars today that company is called ssi safe super intelligence incorporated on stage ilia first
talked about the advancements of ai as a whole he talked about the original work he did with others
in ai centering on an auto regressive model trained on text a large neural network and a large data set the
deep learning dogma that ilia presented that he and others had found out was that a 10-layer neural
network can replicate any task a human can in a fraction of a second and what ilia said was a huge discovery
was that they discovered that biological and artificial neurons can actually be quite similar
and artificial neurons can be designed to mimic function and work just like a real aka biological neuron
this alone was a huge breakthrough think of it like imagining up in your mind the best castle you could ever
think of maybe it floats in the air maybe it has wings it's just outlandishly crazy and there's probably no way
anyone could build it that is what scientists engineers and brilliant minds like ilia set out to build when
they built the artificial neuron you know the crazy part it actually happened mankind has replicated one of the
the greatest things in existence the neuron in a brain and we've done it successfully ushering in a
breakthrough where we can literally hand off work to the machines because they can think faster better
at a cheaper safer level than we ever can i'm quoting some words in that last sentence from my good friend
dave shapiro ilia continued to go through much of the science behind what we have today including the
transition from lstms to transformers powering gbt itself the generative pre-trained transformer then
ilia went into the scaling hypothesis and the age of pre-training that he says later on we have left
we are literally entering another age we've left pre-training behind but pre-training was what led us
to the breakthroughs that gave us gbt2 and gbt3 this idea that larger data sets larger networks would
power the next evolution of gbt was in fact correct it has shaped modern ai but much like ilia says in
his talk this december data is the new fossil fuel of ai but it also became our limiting factor because as
ai ran out of data pre-training no longer worked and so this is where around the nine minute mark in
ilia's talk that he points to the future direction of where the new data is going to come from and how
we are leaving what is now an old paradigm of ai and entering an all new one to produce the next
evolution of what ai can do and completely eliminate that bottleneck of running out of data how are we going
to get past this limiting factor ilia says the future will be found in synthetic data generation
which is something we have heard from other experts and inference time compute and whenever ilia goes
into the future of these things this is where things get a little crazy he talks about this idea of
genuine reasoning where ai can reason not the machine-like pattern-based kind of cold sometimes
inaccurate reasoning we have in the models today which is not classified as human-like reasoning
even though yeah it can reason through a math problem better than i could but what's coming to
these models will be genuine human-like reasoning and ilia says that that will bring unpredictable
capabilities that are very similar to biological scaling patterns where we as humans can get completely
unpredictable we can hallucinate the power of reasoning in our human neural net has never
been replicated till now and what's coming is true human-like reasoning which will produce a whole nother
set of enormous benefits but also potential problems that we're gonna have to navigate through i want
you to listen to what i think is the most important clip from ilia's entire talk about the future
direction of ai super intelligence and reasoning here it is if you believe the deep learning dogma so
to say that artificial neurons and biological neurons are similar or at least not too different
and you believe that real neurons are slow than anything that we can do quickly by v i mean human beings
i even mean just one human in the entire world if there is one human in the entire world that can do
some task in a fraction of a second then a 10-layer neural network can do it too right it follows you
just take their connections and you embed them inside your neural net the artificial one so this was the
motivation anything that a human being can do in a fraction of a second a big 10-layer neural network
can do too i'll take a bit of liberty to speculate about what comes next actually i don't need to speculate
because many people are speculating too and i'll mention their speculations
you may have heard the phrase agents it's common and i'm sure that
eventually something will happen but people feel like something agents is the future
more concretely but also a little bit vaguely synthetic data but what does synthetic data mean
figuring this out is a big challenge and i'm sure that different people have all kinds of
interesting progress there and an inference time compute or maybe what's been most recently most
vividly seen in o1 the o1 model these are all examples of things of people trying to figure out
what to do after pre-training and those are all very good things to do
i want to mention one other example from biology which i think is really cool
and the example is this so about many many years ago at this conference also i saw a talk where
someone presented this graph but the graph showed the relationship between the size of the body of
the size of the body of a mammal and the size of their brain in this case it's in mass
and the that talk i remember vividly they were saying look it's in biology everything is so messy
but here you have one rare example where there is a very tight relationship between the size of the
body of the animal and their brain and totally randomly i became curious at this graph and one of
the early one of the early so i went to google to do research to look for this graph and one of the
images in google images was this and the interesting thing in this image is you see like i don't know
is the mouse working oh yeah the mouse is working great so you've got this mammals right all the
different mammals then you've got non-human primates it's basically the same thing but then you've got
the hominids and to my knowledge hominids are like close relatives to the humans in evolution
like the neanderthals
there's a bunch of them like it's called homo habilis maybe there's a whole bunch and they're all here
and what's interesting is that they have a different slope on their brain to body scaling exponent
so that's pretty cool what that means is that there is a precedent there is an example of
biology figuring out some kind of different scaling something clearly is different
so i think that is cool and by the way i want to highlight this x-axis is log scale you see this is
a hundred this is a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand and likewise in grams one gram ten gram hundred
grams thousand grams
so it is possible for things to be different the things that we are doing the thing that we've been
scaling so far is actually the first thing that we figured out how to scale and without doubt
the field everyone who's working here will figure out what to do but i want to talk here i want to take a
few minutes and speculate about the longer term the longer term where are we all headed right we're
making all this progress it's an it's astounding progress it's really i mean those of you who have
been in the field 10 years ago and you remember just how incapable everything has been
like yes you can say even if you kind of say of course deep learning still to see it is just
unbelievable it's completely i can't convey that feeling to you you know if you've joined the field
in the last two years then of course you speak to computers and they talk back to you and they disagree
and that's what computers are but that doesn't always been the case but i want to talk to a little
bit about super intelligence just a bit because that is obviously where this field is headed this is
obviously what's being built here and the thing about super intelligence is that it will be different
qualitatively from what we have and my goal in the next minute to try to give you
some concrete intuition of how it will be different so that you yourself could reason about it
so right now we have our incredible language models and their unbelievable chatbots and they can even do
things but they're also kind of strangely unreliable and they get confused when while also having
dramatically superhuman performance on evals so it's really unclear how to reconcile this
but eventually sooner or later the following will be achieved those systems are actually going to be
agentic in a real ways whereas right now the systems are not agents in any meaningful sense just very
that might be too strong they're very very slightly agentic just beginning it will actually reason and by
the way i want to mention something about reasoning is that a system that reasons the more it reasons
the more unpredictable it becomes the more unpredictable it becomes all the deep learning
that we've been used to is very predictable because if you've been working on replicating human intuition
essentially one of my favorite things to do these days is to stay up late and push the limits of what
ai can do on saturday december 14th i had a breakthrough with ai personally myself i want to tell you about
which prompted a thought that ilia actually confirmed in his talk that i caught up to shortly after i had
my own ai breakthrough so what was the i breakthrough well sora from open ai came out that week i generated
this what i would classify beautiful clip in mere minutes from a flux laura that had been trained on
my face my likeness somehow we were able to get past open ai's policy on sora where you can't upload an
image of yourself or anyone else for that matter there could be copyright problems and i would
even say deep fake danger potential from taking somebody's image and being able to instantly create
lifelike video but somehow i was able to do it by replicating myself as a queen in the realm of fantasy
and we had this beautiful clip to show for it whenever this clip became real and i published it and i
watched it on loop i began to think about the future of film entertainment and then that led me to
the future of how we connect the future of communication between us as humans i would argue
that art words music is in fact the bedrock of connectivity between us as humans and being able to
generate beautiful things in all three realms music writing and art from a simple text idea is so
revolutionary i believe it's hard to put into words i mean think about it the busy mom that doesn't have
access or the time or the funds to a hollywood production set actors script writers that mom can open
one of these models and type in her idea and instantly generate a beautiful piece of art and that's just
one finite example you apply that across the world and let's say quantum brings us to massive energy
breakthroughs that are a thousand times more powerful than any fossil fuel we currently have
i believe two plus two is four and this new world hurtling towards us is going to have all the
capabilities we are dreaming of because of the breakthroughs in each area we've even gotten
past the limiting factor inside artificial intelligence of running out of data we are in
a post pre-training era which happened literally months after identifying the limiting factor of
pre-training itself all right so follow me here so this crazy ai breakthrough i had was through asking
this one question if ai is capable of generating something so beautiful in mere minutes what's to
stop me from realizing every single one of my creative dreams so i went back to one of those dreams and it
was to publish a fiction that went up against every mainstream fictional narrative we've seen from movies
like the terminator from books like as much as i love it the enforcers the machine stops every single
book tv show movie that has been built on the cyberpunk dystopia yes even utopia era of technological
revolution has portrayed it as a dystopian evil of some sort i mean why else would you buy a ticket to
that movie if the machine was benevolent it wouldn't be as fun to watch but i am getting tired of this
narrative i think that it holds a lot of us in slavery to fear of the machines and i believe that
machines will be capable of our greatest liberation from all the work we shouldn't be doing because
we are human beings not human doings and in our natural state of being is when we actually produce
our best thoughts our best work our best outputs and if we can tap into the power of the machines as
our most powerful resource on earth pretty soon we're going to be able to do unbelievable things and in
that i believe unbelievable good ask yourself why is every narrative around artificial intelligence and
technology presenting it as evil what if that is just another way to keep us subjugated a product of
the system and programmed for profit driven motives so after i asked myself that question well what's
to stop me from creating this book i've been wanting to create for years what if i could create it in
minutes i went to claude where i have a project trained on a hundred thousand words of julia's
content that's a lot of my books that's a lot of my video scripts a lot of my raw thoughts about the
future based on all the books i've read and all the content i've consumed so i went to that you could
call it a model it's a project and i began to work with claude to write this book and what happened
is that in one hour i had a book fully written that rivaled em forrester's the machine stops that
rivaled the action in the terminator the sci-fi nature the plot the characters of this book were
so good i don't even know how much time it would have taken me to think of this on my own and then
i went and cloned my actual voice in 11 labs it took me a couple days to get the voice clone dialed in
the writing of the book which is arguably much harder was way faster i had the book completely
done in less than an hour and as of recording this video this book is off to my book formatter
for a full release on amazon in every format by this christmas 2024 i can't believe i'm even
saying this i want to give you a little preview of the audible version of my book which will release
100 in my voice but it's not my human voice everything you're about to hear
is an ai clone of me the words have been written by ai and the voice is an ai clone of my voice
so check it out i present to you a sneak peek of my new fiction releasing this christmas called
liberation through the machines we're gonna wrap up on this little bit of narration you can actually
purchase this book now it's on pre-order on amazon look for it in all formats to release
on december 25th 2024 my friends welcome welcome to the ai age it's a brilliant time to live in i
believe it's up to us to harness it for our advantage i'm here to help you do just that i'll
leave you with this preview of my ai clone something extraordinary is happening on december 9th 2024 i
watched as google announced stabilized qubits in their willow chip the first quantum processor designed for
commercial use we first identified quantum mechanics in 1900 now 124 years later we're
holding quantum chips in our hands four days later i witnessed sora breathe life into an image
i'd created months ago through flux laura in 15 minutes i had a beautiful movie trailer something
that would have taken a full production team weeks months lots of money to create and on december
14th i watched in awe as claude an ai trained on over 100 000 words i wrote crafted the book you're
about to read these aren't just technological advances they're keys to a door we've forgotten exists
a door leading back to human sovereignty we've become machines ourselves haven't we trapped in endless
cycles of work separated from our families exhausted by tasks that drain our souls we've accepted this
as normal necessary inevitable but what if it's not what if the machines we've been taught to fear
are actually our path to liberation what if all this technology isn't meant to replace us but to free
us free us to create to love to live to be human again what if the future my 10 and 2 year old get to
live in is one where they never for a single second have to be enslaved remember when you were a child
before the world taught you that your worth was measured and output in those golden moments when
simply existing was enough watching clouds drift across summer skies feeling grass between your toes
laughing for no reason but the joy of being alive somewhere along the way they convinced us that our
value could be measured in spreadsheets and profit margins they turned the sacred dance of human existence
into a relentless march of doing doing doing corporate towers became our new temples productivity
our new prayer but listen your worth isn't in your output your value isn't in your velocity your essence
isn't in your efficiency you're not a machine built for profit you are not a cog crafted for commerce
you are not a resource to be drained you are a miracle of consciousness a symphony of stardust a poem
written in flesh and spirit we've forgotten how to be because we're so exhausted from doing we've
lost the art of presence in the pursuit of production we've traded our birthright of wonder
for the heavy chains of endless tasks but what if what if we remembered what if we reclaimed our divine
right to simply be what if we restored the balance between doing and being between creation and
contemplation between productivity and presence your value was never in what you could produce
it was always in who you are it always will be human being not human doing remember this story
you're about to read came to me in a moment of clarity while watching my ai generated film loop
on repeat i began to envision a future where technology doesn't enslave us it empowers us where
ai doesn't replace human creativity it amplifies it where quantum computers don't control our lives
they give us back control of our time em forster wrote the machine stops in 1900 warning of a future
where humanity becomes enslaved to its machines now over a century later i offer a different vision
not of stopping the machines but of letting them lift us higher of embracing them not as masters but
as wings in these pages you'll meet a queen who sees humanity's pain and offers a different path
you'll meet some humans critical thinkers that are brave enough to question the narrative you'll see
a world where technology serves its true purpose not to make us more mechanical but to make us more
human this book was born from collaboration between human inspiration and artificial intelligence proof
itself that the future isn't about us versus them it's about us and them dancing together towards
something beautiful the liberation is through the machine but first we have to be brave enough to
so we have to embrace it
