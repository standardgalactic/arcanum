so we don't teach our children anything hands-on stuff to teach him these things not just reading
out of a book which is what's wrong with public school so it's true my son cannot read it will
come at the right time i'm supposed to know this already did you know that 54 of american adults
can only read at or below a sixth grade level for reference some sixth grade books are holes a
wrinkle in time and the percy jackson series and those are all great children's books but imagine
not being able to read anything beyond them worse imagine being an adult who struggled to understand
written words at all who was functionally illiterate you wouldn't be able to fill out a job application
follow a recipe you might not even be able to sign your own name wouldn't you do everything in your
power to prevent this from happening to your child well not these parents
recently my youtube homepage has been filled with reactions to parents who unschool their kids on
tiktok and this means that they pull their children out of public school but instead of setting up a
homeschooling curriculum they let the child decide what they're going to learn and when it doesn't
matter what it is if the child doesn't want to learn it they don't i had heard the term
unschooling before but i've never seen it in action and once the initial shock of these videos
wore off i became horrified thinking what future awaits these children if they never learn how to
read so today i want to talk about unschooling literacy and the effects of illiteracy on a person's
life and i'm focusing on literacy not only because this is a books and reading channel but because these
parents by and large don't seem to have any training in education or in child development and
therefore don't seem to understand just how critical it is for a child to learn to read
because it is relevant quick background on me though i'm not an educator now i did study education
alongside literature at the undergrad and graduate levels and i used to work as an assistant in a
remedial reading classroom in an elementary school so i do have a pretty solid understanding of this topic
in order to better understand this situation we need to define a few terms unschooling and literacy
let's start with unschooling
unschooling is a form of homeschooling popularized by the education critic john holt in the 1970s
holt began his career as an elementary school teacher but when he noticed that the school system
focused on repetition and memorization over critical thinking and true understanding he became
disillusioned with formal education and began advocating for homeschooling holt initially
believed he could help reform the school system but the less progress he saw the more radical his
views became so he came to advocate not only for homeschooling but a hands-off child-led approach to
homeschooling he believed quote children who were provided with a rich and stimulating learning
environment would learn what they are ready to learn when they are ready to learn it this approach would
come to be called unschooling when holt's newsletter grow without schooling launched in 1977. it's worth
noting that holt did not have a degree in education or psychology but rather studied industrial engineering
at yale from what i can tell his views about how children learn don't seem to be based in anything
other than his own belief system and some observations from his time as a teacher so you might be wondering
like i was how a curriculum free education is even legal well in the u.s homeschooling is perfectly
legal in all 50 states and because unschooling is technically a form of homeschooling there are no
laws against it however each state differs in how much proof of teaching hours and progress they require
new york for example is on the stricter end the state requires an individualized home instruction plan
prior to every school year and then quarterly and annual reports on the actual progress that was
made idaho on the other hand does not regulate or monitor homeschool education ah idaho a neglectful
parents paradise and now that we have a background on unschooling what do we mean by illiteracy i brought
up the 54 statistic a minute ago but who are the people who fall into this 54 and what do their reading
skills actually look like the statistic comes from a recent study from the u.s department of education
who found that 54 of u.s adults aged 16 to 74 or approximately 130 million people lack literacy
proficiency well that raises the question of what is literacy proficiency literacy is broadly defined as
the ability to read and write but it more accurately encompasses the comprehension evaluation and utilization of
information in other words illiteracy is not only a total lack of reading and writing ability but
also a decreased ability to understand and use information in fact the program for international
assessment of adult competencies say that five times fast identifies five levels of literacy with one
being the lowest and five being the highest they found that one in five u.s adults fall into level one
meaning they struggle to read and understand print materials though some on the higher end could be
able to perform simple tasks based on the info presented to them those at level two can perform
slightly more advanced tasks like paraphrasing and comparing and contrasting but aren't able to do so
with longer or denser texts we'll come back to these categories and definitions in a few minutes during the
reaction portion of the video but i want to highlight a quote from dr iris feinberg who's the director of
the adult literacy research center at georgia state university it's not just people who are poor it's
not just people who are racial minorities it's not just people who speak funny because they're from the
south it literally can be anybody so i'm not someone to throw around the word privilege because it's
kind of become devoid of meaning these days but in this case it does take a certain amount of
privilege and financial stability in order for one or both parents to stay home and homeschool or
unschool a child rather than work outside the home as we'll see there seems to be this unspoken
belief among unschooling parents that illiteracy can't possibly happen to their child and that
couldn't be further from the truth reading and writing are not natural inherent human skills they need
to be taught and if a child is not taught to read they will be illiterate no matter their race or their
class okay you waited long enough before the reaction portion of this video let's start with
the unschooling tick tock that set the internet aflame by a creator called mommy on nami there's a lot
going on in this video that i want to address so we're gonna break it down in sections
so we don't teach our children anything everything that they learn is in response to either their
interests or their questions we have no curriculum we have no school hours we really just respond
whenever they want to know something and do our best to make sure they really get it and my big fear
about free schooling was that if my kids only went towards what they were interested in saving all of
their real estate only for things they're interested in not cramming it with anything necessary
i was concerned that they would never be interested in things like reading and writing and math so i'm
immediately noticing some contradictions that i doubt this mother is aware of herself and she says she
wants to save all of her son's brain space for the things that he's interested in none of that necessary
stuff which like how do you how do you put scare quotes around necessary but then expresses fear that he
won't be interested in reading writing and math so she must understand then that reading writing and
math are necessary skills but is also admitting that if her son does not express interest in them
she will not teach them like i just can't imagine being a parent and having this kind of cognitive
dissonance like knowing your son needs to learn these essential skills and yet refusing to teach them if he
doesn't express this like outright enthusiasm just like how how do you really believe that that is
the best thing for your child not to mention often as adults we have to do things we are not interested
in and don't want to do i for one am not interested in math or finances but i'm certainly glad i was
taught enough of both of those things to you know have a budget and do my taxes or else i would be in
some deep trouble now let's talk about that writing my son's six and it took some patience and not
comparing myself to other moms but this is his book look at this lamp egg
jar
lion this is him doing this by himself copying down words from other places asking us more
same with addition mom what's seven plus five uh this lady seems very impressed that her son wrote
egg and lamp on his own but at six years old that's not impressive
this reminded me a lot of the children i worked with when i was a remedial reading assistant
you know the handwriting looks very similar and that it's nearly illegible and it's not you know
staying on a straight line in fact in the classroom i was in some students would come in every day
others would come in two or three times a week depending on their needs and this strikes me as
as an everyday student and notice how she says he's copying down words copying is not writing and of
course copying down letters is part of how you learn to write but just because he can draw the letters
that make up a word doesn't necessarily mean he understands how the language is working and that
he'd be able to identify these words on his own you know like i could copy down words in russian
does not mean i understand russian and the same thing goes for the addition she mentioned telling
your kid that uh seven plus five equals 12 is not the same thing as teaching him how addition works
so that he could get to that answer himself finally let's look at her closing statement it will come
at the right time but if you do not like this idea of sending your kids away for 40 hours a week and
then wondering why they have no energy to do anything else if you are not into your kids conforming
trust that you can follow their interests and they will learn everything they need to learn not what
other people need them to learn her small amount of anecdotal evidence that it will come at the right
time is not nearly strong enough to assert that if you pull your kids out of school they will learn
everything they need to know and what i'd really love to know is what exactly does she mean by uh not
into your kids conforming and what other people need them to learn she's already admitted that reading
writing and math are necessary skills so like what does she think is taught in public schools
that is so horrible she already listed all the important things the main things other than
history maybe that's the horrible thing i i truly don't have an answer and as we'll see with the
rest of these videos it seems like the very idea that their child might ever encounter a rule or ever
be anything less than entertained is what's so offensive but real quick if you found this video
interesting so far i'll be infuriating do consider hitting that subscribe button i'm kelsey joe this
is thought couture where the life of the mind is down to earth and i publish videos almost every week
on book recommendations creative writing advice and literary commentary like this okay now let's meet our
next tick tock famous unschooling mom kelsey ray i have quite a bit to say about her uh first of all
first of all as a kelsey on behalf of all the other kelseys of the world we do not claim her we have
52 days until i pull my child out of public school and start unschooling him he will be in second grade
but i want to share some things with you guys that i'm going to be doing to make sure i don't
fuck up his education or fuck up his future some of you guys in my comments not all of you most people
in my comments actually are homeschooling or unschooling and i love that we built this community of
people this community of like women that really just think the same and i love that like that's
been my goal this entire time with this platform is can we create a community of people that all
think the same and we've done that so tell me in the comments if you homeschool or unschool what are
your best practices your best tips so uh right off the bat she says uh make sure i don't fuck up his
education or his future failed you failed you failed at that i'm also immediately concerned with the
language she's using to describe her community people women who all think the same that's been
my goal uh cult you just described a cult my friend first off notice how she specifies women
that strikes me as a subtle way of striking down any potential opposition by appealing to the the women
supporting women idea i'm willing to bet that if any of her followers or community members
dared call her out she'd respond with oh you're mom shaming you're not a girl's girl blah blah blah
more importantly i have no doubt that this mindset extends to her children she wants to surround
herself with people who all think the same well what place makes it very easy to meet people who don't
think like you public school it's pretty clear i think that this desire for conformity and pulling her son
out of a place of diversity are related although this pro-conformity attitude is an interesting
uh point of departure from the previous video so what are kelsey's big plans for unschooling let's
listen so a couple things that i'm going to be doing are prioritizing to make sure that i don't
fuck up his education and he learns the skills he needs to be a successful adult is lots of time
outside this is going to allow his creativity to flow letting children be children and not setting
them in front of a fucking desk or a piece of paper or a book for eight hours a day is the best way to
get their creativity flowing and that matters in life especially when you're trying to do something
that you love i'm going to take him grocery shopping we're going to start a garden doing lots
of gardening lots of hands-on stuff to teach him these things not just reading out of a fucking book
which is what's wrong with public school so i'm going to also teach him about money that goes into
grocery shopping okay i'm going to teach him how to be frugal teach him how to shop for the things that he
needs not always what he wants i'm going to teach him how to set boundaries with people i'm going
to teach him how to create friendships and connections with people i'm going to teach him
how to bake and cook do you know how many adults there are right now that 30 40 years old don't know
how to fucking cook which is crazy to me okay after a certain point you can't blame your parents for
that shit no more you can learn all right uh we're also gonna be doing lots of sports so he'll be in
any sports every sport that we can possibly think of because we will now have time to do so
i'll be taking them to the aquarium and zoos and learning through life experiences and that is
what unschooling is so we have time outside creativity grocery shopping gardening cooking
money sports uh all things you can teach your kids outside of school and things you should do with
your kids those are all great things you know i'm totally in support of hands-on experiential learning
and fostering a child's creativity there's no problem there with me but schooling and creativity
are not mutually exclusive nor is it true that kids in school sit at a desk for a full eight hours
a day uh recess exists gym class art class music class theater programs field trips clubs sports teams
all sorts of special programs like they already exist in school now it takes a lot for me to feel
offended but i'm starting to feel a little offended by the fact that she's offended by the very concept
of a book we're not just gonna sit in front of a book again like i agree that not every student
learns best by reading and that book learning is only one way to learn but at this age kids absolutely
need to be exposed to books and reading remember those uh literacy levels i mentioned a little bit ago
uh well because her son did attend kindergarten and first grade maybe he's on track with reading for his
age i don't really know she doesn't say but he still needs to work on skills like uh comprehension
grammar and vocab paraphrasing context clues synthesizing ideas not to mention also learning to
express his own thoughts and ideas in writing and he just can't learn that while at the grocery store
or gardening or playing baseball i also can't help but think and suspect that this aversion to reading
is related to the previous point of conformity of thought aside from school where else can
you access ideas that differ from those of the people around you books it's just so sad and alarming
to see just how much this mother is isolating her child and you know she says she wants to foster
creativity and freedom but is also stifling her child's ability to express herself and use his
imagination through language this next thought is not like fully formed but i do think there's this
overarching anti-intellectualism among these tiktok unschooling moms that i don't quite understand and
like anti-intellectualism in our current society is like a big topic i'm thinking about a lot like
really trying to get to the root of but i do know that it is not benefiting these children at all we have
about another minute of kelsey ray and her closing thoughts are something is now a lot of people think
that unschooling and people will say unschooling is giving your child autonomy over what they want to
learn and yes that is true but if you sit there and say what do you want to learn today and your
kid goes i don't really want to learn today you're it's not your job to say okay that's fine no we're
learning something today but what do you want to learn first okay that's how i'm approaching it i'm
not going to give my child full autonomy over dictating his entire education or his entire
like little baby life because if he chose he would choose to do nothing okay um but i will have lots
of stuff planned out for us to do physically hands-on stuff and i believe this is going to be the best
thing i've probably ever done for my kids and i'm really excited i'm gonna record everything so if
you're not following me you definitely should be because i am documenting the out of this experience
because um i have been feeling in my heart for a very long time that public school is just
not it's just not it it's just not and i and i think that a lot of you watching this you probably
feel the same way so i'll take the lead i'll do this i will lead you on this even though i don't
know what the i'm doing i know that i'm gonna i'm gonna figure it out and i trust my instincts and and
what i feel is best for my child over anything else that the government or society has to say about
it so make sure you tap that follow button and follow me if you relate to this i guess i'm glad that
she's not going to let her son learn nothing which is the absolute bare minimum but again i'm seeing
this cognitive dissonance and these contradictions so you know your child would choose to learn nothing
if given the option so then you pull him out of an environment of structure and put him into a
space a movement that is focused on the child's desires you admit you don't know what you're doing
but also think you know better than the government and every educator that has studied teaching and
has been teaching for centuries now remember when i said cult you just described a cult well i wasn't
joking because i went to miss kelsey ray's page noticed she has an alarming number of followers
got nosy clicked her link and she's in a pyramid scheme are you shocked aren't you just so shocked
it's prove it specifically which sells like ketones for weight loss or something if you want to go down
like the whole rabbit hole of mlms and specifically prove it wild unbelievable i know i said i'm focusing
on literacy but i think it would be irresponsible not to mention that i do believe kelsey ray is grooming
her children into becoming her downline and is using unschooling like as a cover i also want to note
here that just because certain tenets of unschooling are fine they're sound you know specifically uh
focusing on like experiential learning and fostering creativity unschooling's lack of structure and the
lack of regulation and monitoring on the government's part lets people like her get away with something
like that finally we're gonna go back to mommy onami for just a minute because she says something very
interesting that i need to address quick side note there are other unschooling parents on tiktok
but these two are far and away the most prominent and therefore i think the most dangerous which is
why i'm focusing on them i'm gonna play this one all the way through and i want you to notice the
language she's using and the dichotomy she's setting up so it's true my son cannot read at age six
there's never going to be a time in my life where i can say yeah my son started reading when he was
five years old he's on the waldorf and montessori schedule it's different but here's the thing about
my kid he's free he's always been free and every single day of his life is a blank canvas that he can
make whatever art he wants with discovery adventure art play interest this is what his day is made up of
there's no conformity there's no needing to pretend that you're sick in order to get a day off there's
no trends there's no ahead or behind there's just being free exactly the way that you are free to learn
at your own pace and there are so many inmates that will know so much more than me inmates get law degrees
and all kinds of stuff and there's so many inmates i would say look this is just the way that it is
this has been a really good thing for me everybody else is doing it we don't live in a creative world
this is just what it is but would any of those inmates not trade in all of these things they've
gotten used to for a chance at being free for a chance to feel the sun on their face every single day
that's what all of this is about thank you so she finally says her son cannot read
we knew that we knew that but thanks i guess for admitting it first off i have a little bone to pick
with the statement uh he's on the waldorf and montessori reading schedule uh full disclosure i did
graduate from a waldorf school i was not there for the elementary school years but i do know
that yes their reading teaching schedule is a little bit later than public school they usually
start teaching i believe around seven instead of five or six but they do have a formal reading
education the students are taught to read they are not just sitting around waiting for it to happen
montessori schools on the other hand at least according to my research usually start even earlier
than public schools around four or five i point this out because the attempt to piggyback off of
other education systems incorrectly as a means of legitimizing her decisions once again points to
this cognitive dissonance she knows deep down probably very deep down that her son should be reading
but she's refusing to put his needs over her own beliefs now what i really want to focus on is her use
of the word free no her son cannot read but he's free to turn every day into a work of art and all of
us who went to school and conform to the demands of society are the inmates i know someone who would
wholeheartedly disagree with this statement and you may know him too oliver james a tick tock star is
documenting his journey of teaching himself to read and inspiring the entire internet in the process on
tick tock oliver james is a personal trainer aspiring motivational speaker i'm here to motivate you and
an open book i start with reading especially when it comes to books 34 year old oliver james went viral
on tick tock in 2022 when he confessed to the internet that he could not read and he started sharing his
journey to literacy at the time oliver was functionally illiterate meaning he had some basic reading and
writing skills but couldn't manage daily tasks that required much reading he has several videos on his
page talking about things that were difficult for him before he could read so i'm gonna play some
clips here so y'all know i'm teaching myself to read and i used to get a lot of anxiety going out to eat
because i didn't know how to read menus i would just get familiar foods if i have to so we have the
grocery store had to get some vegetable broth now one of the cool things about learning to read is
these aisle things up here now you know like these things right there right them zones right there
right so you look up at those and it'll tell you exactly like where the products are in the aisles
that's something i didn't know so i'm here at the library right now i have to go in here to try to get
some documents read to me because i don't know how to read them i need something read to me is it
possible i can give you like something to read to me oliver james says he never learned how to read as a
child and spent his entire adult life finding ways to hide that every situation needed a strategy
from job applications i got bad eyes can you help me fill this out and pay them 20 bucks or like
you find ways a fast food menu if you went in before me and you're like can i get a number one
with no ketchup then i would order that way even dating my friends used to text for me but i remember
that that was hard so we have ordering familiar foods or ordering the same thing as someone else
because he couldn't read the menu being unable to find the aisle or the product he needed in a
grocery store having friends text for him asking librarians to read him documents does that sound
like freedom to you no no it doesn't the definition of freedom is the power or right to act speak or
think as one wants without hindrance or restraint what is more of a hindrance than lacking the language that
will let you act speak and think as you want but we are the inmates right yeah speaking of inmates
um i misplaced the exact video where oliver discusses this but on his page he does tell us that
he was incarcerated several years ago for i believe uh trafficking firearms and talks about how part of
the reason he was arrested is because he couldn't read and didn't know what he did was a crime uh even
while being processed in jail he couldn't understand his paperwork and didn't even know why he was
there in the first place for that reason i think it's just so nasty to call people who are taught
to read inmates when there is a strong connection between illiteracy and incarceration some studies
show that 70 percent of incarcerated people can't read above a fourth grade level and literate inmates
had a 16 chance of returning to prison whereas the illiterate inmates had a 70 chance and that is
huge clearly yeah so i bet your kid's gonna really appreciate these days of freedom when he's behind
bars like actually think about that for a second just as important as the literal effects of illiteracy
are the emotional effects here are some clips from oliver's most viewed tiktok i'm sorry
i'm learning how to read y'all it's either this or i turn off turn off the camera and just
be angry and don't learn because regardless this is why people give up when you see an adult and they
be like why you never learn because this is what they would have to go through i don't know if they'll
go through it like me but i'm gonna tell you something if you don't know how to read and you're
adult and you're going to start learning how to read you will not get through this without any
vulnerability bro like you you don't you don't i'm supposed to know this i'm supposed to know this
already let's go you're learning you're learning how to read you're learning it's what it is let's go
let's go let's go supposed to know this stuff yo i'm supposed to already know how to read i'm supposed
to get this let's go so i am woman enough to admit that i cried watching this for the first time
and second time what's so affecting about oliver's videos is just how open he is about the profound
shame illiteracy has caused him but so is the joy of finishing a new book or finally understanding
a grocery aisle sign like i i just i simply cannot fathom how any parent could come across his page
see his struggle and think yeah yeah i'll risk it i will do nothing to prevent that from happening
to my own child for any hardcore unsquillers still watching this do you really believe that oliver
was simply not ready to read until he was 34 isn't it obvious that reading ability did not just
naturally manifest in him and that he's clearly working hard to learn oliver was failed by the
system because don't get me wrong the school system can and does fail students it is not perfect
but what makes you think that you and your child are immune to this oliver's teachers refused to teach
him reading you are your child's teacher if you do not teach them to read this is their future if you
can't tell i really care about reading finally i need to put out there that i have never been as
genuinely proud of a total stranger as i am oliver james getting yourself to read as an adult is an
incredible feat and i applaud him for speaking publicly about an issue that is so highly stigmatized
i hope he's out there having a great day and reading everything his heart desires
i tried to come to this issue of unschooling with an open mind truth be told i do have a little bit
a little bit of sympathy for parents who are considering unschooling i know from personal
experience that the public school system is not the best fit for every child as alluded to earlier i
switched from public to private school in high school because my social anxiety disorder was so
severe that i i refused to go back to public school and doing so saved my education i also think we do
need to address the elephant in the classroom of gun violence in america i'm filming this just 10 days
after the school shooting in georgia which was the deadliest of 2024 so far and there are no words
to express the horror and the grief this crisis is causing that our administration refuses to do
anything about as a child free person i cannot imagine the terror of sending your children to school
every day not knowing if they're going to make it back that that is something absolutely no one
should ever experience and i do understand completely the impulse to remove your children from that
environment for these reasons i don't think homeschooling in general is the worst thing i do
think it is possible for parents to know their children really well and to be highly engaged and
structured in their education and making sure they progress so they should and what worries me is
that if you're a parent whose child is struggling for whatever reason or if you're justifiably terrified
for your child's safety and you come across someone like kelsey ray or mommy onami and unschooling seems
like this saving grace like the answer and you just might not realize that it comes with its own
extreme risks and consequences one of the glaring issues with the philosophy of unschooling is that
you don't know what you don't know how does a child know what they're interested in if they're
not exposed to all the possibilities you know say maybe your kid has the potential to be the next
emily dickinson or whitman and but if you don't have poetry books around how will they know they love
poetry plus most knowledge is cumulative say your child is super interested in american history
that's all well and good but to really understand the founding of the us for example they're going
to need to learn pretty much all of history prior to that point but none of that can happen without
literacy there is a reason reading is taught first and foremost in schools it underlines
everything a person could need or want to know or do in this world one of oliver's tick tocks that's
been stuck in my mind is where he opens up about how reading has taught him just how much goes on
in the world that he never knew before uh and and unfortunately lots of it is awful uh you know
reading the diary of anne frank for the first time and then discovering the holocaust but he also
understands that ignorance is not really bliss ignorance of the world's complexities comes at
the cost of being able to operate in it what's ironic is that the unschooling parents of tick tock
take literacy for granted even though they themselves were taught to read literacy it does not just
naturally dawn on a person so structure and education now means freedom later and why wouldn't
you choose that for your child well goodness gracious that that is it for me today do let me know in
the comments have you heard of unschooling do you know anyone who's either practiced unschooling or been
through it were you yourself unschooled i would love to hear about your thoughts and experiences reminder
you can also follow me on instagram threads and goodreads for fun bookish extras and even more full
length reviews if you enjoyed this video i think you'll also enjoy this one as always thank you so
so very much for watching i hope you have a lovely rest of your day and i will see you in the next one
