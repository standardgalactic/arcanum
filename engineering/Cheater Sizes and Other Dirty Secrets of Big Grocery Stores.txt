organized money please like subscribe and hit the notification button so that more people can get
exposed to organized money really appreciate it so we all remember during the pandemic
that toilet paper became this this hot commodity um i remember we could not find any toilet paper
in in any of our regular stores that we uh go to for groceries and we found some like korean website
that had toilet paper and finally we were able to to get it and and have it shipped and it came
and it was like a quarter of the size of a normal roll of toilet paper uh it was it was like someone
took a ray like a gamma ray and and shrunk down the toilet paper so uh that became our emergency
stockpile um and uh it was it was very harrowing for us and everybody else so today we have a great
set of guests we have um the ceo of affiliated foods which is a as and it's a food wholesaler
based in texas sells to uh it's a co-op sells to stores grocery stores independence in eight states
uh randy is is great you're gonna you're gonna love him and then the other person is a a lawyer lobbyist
in dc named chris jones and uh he is actually a very creative anti-monopoly lobbyist lawyer you don't
meet many of those um and uh this one i think it is it is fair to call it the uh the tyranny of the
dollar store yeah or the tyranny of walmart but i mean the interesting thing is that when we couldn't
find i don't have a walmart near me i live in in los angeles there's there's one pretty far away uh
we couldn't find in the regular stores this these materials during the pandemic but they were all
available in walmart and this episode will explain why and why that's still a problem five years after
covet that uh they still have trouble independent grocers sourcing materials that you can find in
abundance at walmart all right organized money randy and chris welcome to the show thanks for having us
thank you okay so we usually start with the jewish mother part of the show which where we brag about
the credentials of our guests sometimes i adopt a terrible accent i'm not going to do that today
i just don't feel like it don't have it in me uh but i'll start with chris uh chris jones is the
chief government relations officer and counsel at the national grocers association he is a lawyer
in washington dc and he has really taken this an obscure antitrust law that's really important
called the robinson patman act hadn't been enforced for 40 years he has really put it on the map
and that is a law prohibiting price discrimination
all right yes uh sorry i i do this and uh randy arsenault uh you're the president and ceo of
affiliated foods in amarillo texas a cooperative of retailers in eight states uh serving 1500 employers
1.7 billion dollars in volume uh owns a bakery a dairy a bottled water plant meat cutting and and
produce facilities and has partnered with a vertical growing operation named bushwood acre farms to
provide tomatoes and peppers that is some operation uh congratulations on your success and we're excited to
talk to you about it thank you well well let's start with you um uh you know you have said in in
past articles that uh the average consumer has no idea what it takes to get a grocery on a shelf for
them to buy and i think i speak for matt and myself when i say we are average consumers uh and and we don't
have that information so you know tell me about that what what does it take you know to get a
a piece of meat or a tomato or whatever uh onto the shelf and and how to how does your business
serve that interest well first of all we are grocery wholesaler right so you can look at when
you look at any piece of business there's usually a middleman that falls in the the arena of the
operations and we are that person so we're the middleman between the manufacturer and the customer
that we service and actually goes one more step further the consumer that buys those products
so going back to your question early about the average consumer not understanding what it takes
to get items on the shelf my favorite example that i like to use always is the good old banana
you know in in the produce departments and the stores that we all shop at the banana is usually the
number one selling item in the produce department what people don't realize is bananas are grown in
guatemala right so the the farmer has to plant bananas right harvest them then we put them in boxes
they ship them on containers over the ocean we pick them up in galveston texas we transport them here
to our facility we put them in gassing rooms as they refer to it because the banana is gourd green when it
arrives so last time you had a banana i'm sure you didn't choose a gourd green one to eat with your
cereal and milk so then we ripen them and get them to that beautiful yellow color that you like to buy
as a consumer so we ripen them we get orders from our customers we select the bananas according to how
many cases they purchase we load them on a truck we deliver them to the store the store receives them
the produce guy puts them on the rack and you the consumer expects them for 50 cents a pound
so when you think about that for one second i i feel sorry for the guy that's growing them he can't
be making any money because when you take all those steps involved in transporting them and the cost to
do that and yet the average consumer does pay 50 cents a pound for bananas every day so i'm all i always
say that i always use that example because the consumer has no clue what it takes to get the the products
and you know that they're looking for in a grocery store and at the price they expect it to be at
uh you know canned vegetables anything down the grocery aisle same process manufacturer has to
manufacture it right the same process goes through through all the different channels and yet they
expect to buy a can of corn on the shelf for 59 cents and so you know whether that's the right price
point or not is the price point we have spalled americans to for many many many decades and and
it's um and you know it was challenging especially during the pandemic trying to help the consumer
understand why we had no product on the shelf so so your customers are you know you're you're a wholesaler
so your customers are the stores not the end consumers how did you get into the business well in 1946
there was five grocery guys that came together and said you know what we're all trying to buy
products for our stores on our own if we came together and opened our own cooperative our own
wholesaler that would give us more buying power so we could better get better you know get a better
cost of goods and have more of an efficient model of distribution to our own our own stores and that's
how we started five guys got together sitting on a milk crate behind one of these grocery stores
with a banker and financed us and here we are 80 years later we service over 700 locations doing
1.7 billion dollars a year and i mentioned earlier we're a cooperative so we're member owned
uh you you have to you have to join our co-op you have to pay you know stock pricing and there's a
whole model that we follow for them to be a member and then we take all of our profits every year and
we re re rebate them back to the customers that own this warehouse so we're not the typical wall
street you know conglomerate that people pay attention to on the stock market every day
we're owned by individual grocery men and women throughout the eight state region that we service
i like to refer to them as the mom and pops of the world right we all grew up in the community that we
had a local iga or we had a local piggly wiggly or we had a local uh tony's food mart in the town that
we grew up in and we still service those customers today so you're like big mom and pop big mom and
pop some locations of big mom and pop some not so much and then we have uh big mom and pops uh lobbyists
uh here uh chris um i don't want to sully you with that that word as a negative i'll have to get new
business cards now i think um but you know tell tell us what you know just give us a sense of of
what you do you're you're obviously a lawyer you're you're someone who thinks about policy at a trade
association um tell us about you know what what you do as a council there and let me just can i just in
i want to chime in because i've known chris for a while he's a very he's an he's not just a a sort
of dc lawyer he's an important part of the anti-monopoly uh kind of arguments right he's somebody
who's taken these arguments and turned them into law so this is this is not some um
oh did he freeze yes yes i think so uh why don't you go ahead with your answer and then hopefully he'll
uh he'll jump back on darn right as he is uh he's singing my praises oh well um so i am chris jones
i'm the head of relations and council at the national grocers association so we represent
independent supermarkets like all of randy's retail customers and then the wholesalers like randy who
services all of them so my job in dc is really to to go to battle on behalf of our membership and my main
focus over the years has been really targeted towards retail competition antitrust and really
just trying to get the wholesalers like randy a fair shake so that the communities that his independent
grocers serve can get the prices that they expect when they go to the grocery store great
um so randy i have just a lot of questions about the food business so i want to start with you know
your basic crowd pleaser you kind of got into this a little bit earlier um which is today right i think
you you talked a little bit about how food has been inexpensive for a long time that 59
said can of corn or the or the 50 said banana per pound of banana but i think it's gotten um you know
over the last couple of years we've seen tremendous inflation in the food sector and i guess my question
is why are prices so high and as a you know i as a kid right i remember prices being pretty low but also
prices being lower in the u.s than they are in other countries and now it's kind of the opposite so i'm
wondering if you have any insight like what happened to bring prices up so high recently
you know obviously covet and then why is there this kind of flip where where stuff is expensive in
the u.s uh food is expensive in the u.s and it's not as expensive abroad well well first of all uh you
were right in saying that covet pretty much started this whole issue that we're dealing with on pricing
right supply and demand controls grocery price and just like it controls automobile price and home price and
everything is based on supply and demand well we all know during covet supply and demand went out the
window right the demand was super high and the supply was very low and so i will tell you that today
we are still trying to recover from covet in certain areas of the grocery store producers still have not
caught up production to meet back the demands of the consumer we have that many many areas today and as long
as you continue to have the high demand and still not the adequate supply you're going to see strong
pricing you know a lot of other things impacted that freight cost impacted the cost of goods as we
transport them across the country or from abroad the cost to do so went up which becomes part of the cost of
goods not to mention covet put us into a situation you know the government was trying well i say the
government congress was trying to pass or had discussions about increasing minimum wage well
they didn't have to pass one law to increase minimum wage covet increased minimum wage as you know we had
more and more people staying at home not wanting to participate in the workforce on a daily basis the need for
for associates in our company continue to grow and grow and grow because we couldn't get anyone to come to
work so what what at the time we had to begin and start and pay of about 14 an hour prior to covet in
our warehouse facility now we had 21 an hour and it took us that to get people to come back to work
into the workforce and to compete i mean in our market we had mcdonald's paying 18 an hour to flip a
burger and i don't mean that i don't want to do you know diminish the role they play but at the same time
when we have operations that require certain skill set we had to we had to up our game to this higher
cost of of labor well cost of labor reflects into cost of operations cost of inflated cost of
operations goes into cost of goods which goes to cost of goods at the retail store and the consumer
sees that and unfortunately i'm a big believer that we're not going to see a whole lot of price
declines coming from the manufacturers matter of fact we have not seen price declines come from the
manufacturers since covet we have continually on a year to year basis seen food inflation from two
and a half as high as four percent continuous every year and i think we're going to continue to see that
um and you know one of the components that affects us but what but why why are you i mean yes
coveted was a thing that happened but it's 2025 why are food manufacturers continuing to
you know why is pricing strong from two and a half to four percent a year from the many manufacturers
well cost of operations as i said earlier they have in labor increases they have in cost of raw
manufacturing goods are increasing you know i'm not even bringing up the tariff situation which is a whole
different element that we may be facing here very shortly and we have had a lot of discussion in
roundtable meetings how do we handle a 25 increase in cost of goods and you know how do we pass that
on to the consumer uh that's another element we haven't really dealt with yet where you know we're a
week away from the possibility of that happening but there's we call that liberation day randy you're
calling that's what we call all right and then we also got to remember because of the demand going
up in a lot of a lot of different categories since covet these manufacturers have began to build and roll
out new manufacturing facilities well you don't put one of those up for a hundred bucks right those
things are very costly and that goes back into the cost of goods and and it flows back down to the
consumer at the end of the day yeah so i think we're going to continue to see you know parts of
that play back down into cost of goods as we move forward and then and then there are your costs and
when you were going through just sort of the life cycle of a banana i i thought it was really
interesting the fact that you're actually ripening them uh obviously they're not true if they were
tree ripe and we'd be in big trouble to be black by the time they got to the grocery store so but
the fact that you have to do all that i mean uh what's interesting to me is is the tech that goes
in to your operation people think that oh tech's only for amazon tech's only for you know these these
these super new uh and and cool companies but it sounds like there's a lot of technology that goes
into your business could you tell me about that well there's a ton of technology again i think someone
mentioned earlier we have our own dairy so we bottle milk well there's a ton of technology
in the automation process of that plus again going back to the labor force i can't just get anybody
off the street to come work in our dairy we have to have skilled labor and an understanding of
automation same thing in our bakery same thing in our meat cutting processing facility all of those
areas and to your point when it comes to ripening bananas there's a true art to doing that trust me
it could go one way bad or one way really bad and so and again it takes a skilled individual to do that
and you have to pay a higher wage to have those skilled individuals to be part of your staff
so i have a slightly different this is a an obligatory question in every dc panel are you looking at ai in
your operation the only if the answer is no i will be very happy well the only thing we have used ai
for was a marketing campaign period there you go okay that is it nothing else all right and that was
to give us you know some ideas on going to market with a certain campaign we were launching that is
the only time we have ever used it okay it's good to hear look what you're leaving on the table um
um so uh you know so you're a co-op you you work with a a bunch of grocery stores but they're all
of more of the independent uh local variety what is it like to compete with some of the big boys out
there like walmart for example i mean what what advantages do they have over you and what do you
do to compensate for that well first of all uh yes we do service all independent operators that's who we are
like most of the grocery cooperatives in the country um well walmart's the mammoth and you know
we're out there with our bow and arrow every day trying to beat that animal um there's no secret
they're they're a force uh they're their own sometimes i consider them there's a there's their own
country uh i mean they they operate uh efficiently you can't take that away from them
uh i can't tell you they're a bad retailer because they do a lot of great things right
but the one thing that they do better than anybody and a lot of that has to do with their buying power
is the ability to dictate with the manufacturers what they expect and what they deserve in their mind
what they deserve and i mean if you go back and look at the history of walmart there have been
manufacturers that may have been small to middle-sized manufacturers that eventually went out
of business because they put all their eggs in that one basket and then when walmart would dictate pricing
and they couldn't honor that pricing because the cost of the operations then a lot of them just went
went away they went out of business but you have the big players the proct and gamblers of the world the
you know kellogg's of the world general mills of the world that are big but walmart in some cases is
still 25 to 30 percent of their overall volume and that's one customer dictating you know 35 or 40 in
some cases percent of the profit and loss statement that they're managing as a company every day the
production that's put forth and so because of that ability to offer that volume they utilize that that
their size to beat up on a vendor i mean there's no secret everybody in the industry knows that's how
it works well unfortunately for us uh most of the manufacturers give in to walmart's ask
well if you have a pnl and and you got a your fortune 500 company you're reporting to wall street
and you got a bunch of investors that expect x amount on the bottom line how do you get there
if you're taking the largest customer and giving them something no one else gets well then you got
to charge me more and you got to charge somebody else more in order to accommodate the profit and
loss statement that's expected by the stockholders in that company so i always refer to my company and
other wholesalers and the independent channel as the subsidizers to walmart we subsidize walmart through
costs to give them what they need to be the lowest price in the markets that we serve yeah this is a
an antitrust show so we throw around the term gatekeeper a lot and particularly in the tech
market so you know like apple being a gatekeeper in in the you know the market for apps or amazon
in the e-commerce market it's really not any different with walmart in the grocery marketplace
if they're anywhere depending on how you frame the market they're up to a third of us grocery sales
so that gives them the same kind of gatekeeping power that we observe in the tech markets
in grocery because if you are a supplier if you are one of those large suppliers that
that randy named you have to do business with walmart if you want to reach american consumers
so for most suppliers walmart is anywhere between 20 to 30 percent of your domestic sales but if you
flip that around for walmart that supplier is like a decimal point so it creates this bargaining
asymmetry that allows walmart to do exactly what randy is going through they dictate terms they squeeze
the suppliers so much that they have no choice but to increase costs on everybody else in the
marketplace and what really lit this problem on fire is going back to the covet example we talked
about prices went up walmart didn't want to pay higher prices so they basically said you know find
another way to make up for your cost of production increases and they did it on the backs of the
independent grocer so i want to ask randy something quickly and then get back to you chris to talk about
the robinson patman act so but i want to kind of put myself in the in the mindset of kind of a normal
american consumer who's kind of heard the arguments about how things work and it's like what i would say
is well walmart is just really good at getting low prices they're really efficient and you know that's
capitalism right you have walmart or or or you know any of the big guys they're just better at you
know sort of delivering stuff cheaper not not like oh well you know they're they're there's some sort
of unfairness here because unfairness you could say is maybe part of the system or or or not but the but
i guess the question i would have is you know you're kind of saying no that's actually not what's going on
walmart is maybe they are more efficient in some ways or maybe they're less efficient in some ways it
depends on the operator you're comparing them to but they're just getting better prices right from the
manufacturer they're just getting a price advantage be only because they're big not because they are
better at anything is that is that a fair characterization of what you're what you're saying
randy i will tell you that's yes so let me explain that just a second so i've been doing this for 40
years so i've been around the block a little bit in the grocery industry if you get a if you get a price
list from a manufacturer let's use procter and gamble so charmin we all know what charmin is right
the price list they give you the best bracket you can buy and it's called a truckload so you can buy
you know half a truck three quarters of a truck and your price is different right so if a manufacturer
tells me their best bracket is a truckload that tells me that's that's their most efficient uh way
of you turning in an order and you buying from them well at a 1.7 billion dollar wholesale business we
buy truckloads of many many many many items every day i will tell you that same truckload of charmin
that i'll buy one skew full load my cost will be higher than walmart selling it to the consumer in
their store wow and and the you can't get more efficient than one item one solid truckload because
you can't put any product on top of the truck and expect it to ride down the road so a truckload is a
truckload is a truckload and that's where i get into a lot of heated discussions with the manufacturers
is the fact that i'm meeting the criteria of a full truckload single item but yet my cost is
higher than walmart's retail to the consumer okay so getting back to you chris is that legal
no it's not it's not supposed to be legal the robinson patman act prohibits that if but you know if
if so what is what is robinson patman act because i think this is really shocking that when most
people hear about it they think well that's just that's fine but to hear that that charging two
different customers different prices for the same item to hear that that's illegal when it's a commodity
is i think a real shock so can you talk about what is the robinson patman act and explain why that's
not actually legal yeah so robinson patent act is an antitrust law that dates back to the 1930s the
great depression the idea is that if randy is purchasing in the same quantity the truckload
quantity as a larger retailer his larger competitor he should get the same price for that now if walmart
can make the case that you know they're buying 100 truckloads versus randy's five truckloads or whatever
it may be is more efficient now they can get a discount um based on the actual efficiencies
created if it if it lowers the marginal cost of production for example for the manufacturer
but we have basically decided that robinson patman doesn't make sense in this day and time we've
decided this 40 years ago and so the law is just constantly being violated and evaded by the market
participants and players because they don't have any fear of enforcement there there's just there's
supposed to be enforced by the federal trade commission and doj and they've really stopped
looking at this problem for about 40 years up until recently yeah and recently there were a couple cases
that were brought by the ftc obviously that was the ftc under chair lena khan um and you know it's a
little bit uncertain where they're going to go but maybe you could summarize uh these two cases one of
them involves walmart uh to a certain degree so um could could you tell us about the the two separate
rpa cases have been filed sure yeah so ever since covid when we started raising this problem up
there have been a number of investigations that we found out about the ftc had been undertaking
and those culminated in two major cases that were filed over the last several months so in december
there was a case against an alcohol wholesaler named southern glacier so they're by far the biggest
distributor of alcohol products and alcohol is a little bit different of a system than the grocery
world that we that we live in because it's more regulated so it's a little more transparent from a
wholesale standpoint so we know you could tell pretty easily that mom and pop you know wine and liquor
stores were getting much higher prices than the total wines the larger you know wine and alcohol
stores or the walmart's for example so that you know without any the efficiency justification that
that violates the law and it wasn't you know terribly hard i think for the ftc to find that so
they filed a lawsuit alleging that this wholesaler um you know was undermining the robinson padman act
and that was the first case filed in court in in about 40 years there was a settlement back in the
year 2000 but it was the first real shot out out of the gun from from the ftc in december um a more
recent case was against pepsico so um that lawsuit is largely redacted right now it's it's in federal
court in new york um but there the case was filed against pepsico for violating the robinson padman act as
well in providing a you know a large big box store which we think is probably walmart a better price
relative to everyone else in the marketplace a large big box store with the initials wm
that rhymes with a small small mark that is completely redacted i have read these cases
uh a lot of these complaints and they are always redact stuff and it's so stupid and annoying um
because this is supposed to be public sorry i'm gonna stop ranting but it was so obviously we
would like to see it too yeah and you know you know one of the biggest issues we're having is the
fact that we've allowed the vendor community to create these classes of trade that's really the
culprit here is where you have what they consider us as a grocery outlet uh you know deep discounters
like a walmart the dollar channel the convenience channel and then that's their argument oh wait a
minute your price is this because you're in the grocery channel yeah this is because they're the
mass merchandiser well last time i looked mrs jones lives in our same town that me and the walmart
mass merchandiser lives in and we're both fighting for mrs jones to buy you know fruit loops or whatever
right there i'm at a disadvantage from the beginning because they they reclassified them to give them
a better price and model than they will give to the grocery channel right we we decided to give
you a worse price because the nerds in our station have decided that you're in a different seating
arrangement whatever it is yeah um so okay so i think one of the things that that was a big deal
and actually broke through the news around the grocery store world is the the kroger albertson's
attempted merger which didn't which failed and the federal trade commission filed suit as well
as a bunch of states and blocked that merger but i want to ask about the rationale for that merger
because one of the things that came up in the trial was that albertson's executives were saying
and albertson's is huge it's a what 24 billion dollar company or something it's like a massive
company but they were saying look we can't get good pricing compared to walmart and that's why we
have to merge is that was that the rationale for the merger that they just couldn't or was that a
key rationale for the merger and you're i mean randy put on your pundit hat and tell us well i would
tell you that i think it's a big part of it that and that's why we read a lot of articles about creating
another big player in the market that was going to beat up on the vendor community matter of fact i think
it was an article that the ceo even made that suggestion that this would give him the leverage
to leverage on the the the major manufacturers for better cost of goods yeah and and and i don't think
he was trying to keep that a secret so we were we were creating another mega player in the marketplace
that only would impact negatively the independent operator once more again they were basically saying no
fair walmart gets to knuckle under the the suppliers why don't we get to do that um it it's just a bizarre
and and the other interesting thing about that that uh that trial is just what you were just saying
about segmenting the market and how they justify the uh way in which they price by saying oh well you're
not you're not in walmart's category uh kroger and alberson's were trying to do kind of the opposite
in that case they were saying no we compete with walmart we compete with all these other players we
compete with amazon we compete with online grocers and that's why this is such a a big happy family if
we merge we're just a small part of that so it's interesting that when it suits their needs they'll say
it's a big a big you know melting pot but when it doesn't suit their needs they'll say oh no no we
get a particular pricing because we're a different category that's right that's exactly what happened
so um all right it's an interesting problem because we've got this price discrimination law that i don't
think most people knew about until relatively recently and that is in fact driving consolidation in the
industry uh making it harder it's something called i think it's called the waterbed effect when i
understand where it's like if you this was i guess that term was coined in the 70s when people used
water beds and everyone loved water beds super into water beds but you would you would sit on the you
know in the center of the water bed and everything else would kind of rise up so the idea is walmart
or procter and gamble is kind of one of the big suppliers or one of the big vendors or one of the big
buyers they would raise their prices or lower their prices you know as the case may be to the big guys
and then everybody else would take worse terms like a waterbed in the 1970s i don't you know whatever
there we go i didn't i didn't invent it but that's the term that economists like to use because they're
all living in the 70s yeah it's it's very real i'm for suppliers you have to meet a margin a profit margin
level and if your biggest buyer is squeezing you to the point of you're not being profitable you are
kind of left without a choice but then to to discriminate but then to violate the robinson padman
act and increase costs on your smaller customers and that creates this on level playing field that we
think is bad for you know our ability to compete and it's bad for the consumer and kind of going back
to your point matt of of this consolidation era all of this we believe is a byproduct of a lack
of enforcement of the robinson padman act because what it does instead of like incentivizing larger
buyers to then pass those savings on to consumers it incentivizes them to get bigger and stronger so
they can muscle suppliers more so that they can actually take more margin um and and out compete their
competitors so it's just it provides them a moat around themselves so they don't actually have to
compete uh you know it's why randy is probably more efficient than uh the walmart's of the world he has
to be efficient in order to compete and get costs low for his his customers and and their consumers um
whereas if you're just big enough to to squeeze every dollar and cent out of a supplier the incentive
isn't there to actually be efficient it's it's backwards from what um a lot of folks believed to
be the case 40 years ago yeah uh randy you you said something earlier when we were talking about the
categorization and uh that there's you know mass market category and uh different categories but one
of them you mentioned was was dollar dollar store categories now that's interesting i mean obviously we've
seen just a massive proliferation of these i once was driving in west virginia and i saw a dollar general
attached to a family dollar like they were they were that was the the so-called uh uh competition
that you had there it was two dollar stores butted up against one another um and and i'm wondering
you know first of all what is their pricing look like relative to maybe the the people that you deal with
and uh you know why have we seen this this proliferation of of dollar stores across the
country well first of all they are a challenge for us as well if you look at our customer base
and most of the wholesalers in this country that service independence a lot of the towns our stores
are in they're the only grocery store right but now they have a dollar general and a family dollar
that has opened up on top of them in these small communities and they come in and take a big chunk
of the business from the independent operator and the problem with that is is the dollar channel does
not do fresh so what happens is they they take a lot of the volume from your you know inline grocery
or your cleaning aisle your paper aisle and then the consumer has to go to the independent to get fresh
well the independent needs every every area that store to do well in order for him to survive in
that marketplace because if that independent goes out of business that whole community no longer has fresh food they have
canned food packaged food you know but they have no fresh offering in that community and i wanted to say this earlier
that's one of the things that walmart has done to so many of our communities how many times have you driven through a rural america and go to what we used to call the downtown area
that no longer is a downtown area because at one time there was a local hardware store a local pharmacy
local grocery store you know might have been a clothing store and walmart came to the outskirts
of that town and put every one of those people out of business and once all those people out of business
all of a sudden the pricing that walmart brought to the community is different right take get rid of competition
and you can go up on your pricing so they they have helped to create what i call food deserts throughout
our whole country and and that's a problem because when these little towns are looking for a grocery
store to go back into these food deserts gets who they call they don't call walmart because walmart
created it they call the independent or they call us as a wholesaler saying hey look we really need a grocery
store back in our town our people you know our consumers are traveling 30 and 40 miles to get
fresh food now and and it makes it cost prohibitive to go back to these towns and open a store from
ground up it's a health care issue i mean i i i hear from from i go to these health care conferences
and they they use the term food as medicine sure uh you know and then they have dessert uh afterwards for
after the conference but uh but but you know doritos if you're putting someone in that position where the
the most convenient thing for them is going to be to to stock up on the ultra processed foods i mean
you know this is that that's a medical issue it is so i guess well actually yeah there's been studies
you know showing that walmart is responsible for some parts of the obesity like a walmart opens
walmart supercenter opens and then obesity rates go up in that area but i'm i'm interested in so you
talked about how dollar stores are coming in um into some small town to get a you know it has one
grocer a dollar store comes in or there's a walmart nearby is the dollar store also a robinson patman
phenomena are they getting better pricing on their paper products and their pack and packaged foods and
stuff like that are they also getting other subsidies that are not they are same thing we have the same issue
that we have with walmart with the dollar channel and again at the end of the day you know chris i
don't know the number off the top of my head but i think there's over what thirty thousand dollar
stores uh so you think about the buying power that thirty thousand dollar stores have however when you
look at it on an individual basis they're about as the most inefficient operator that exists in any market
uh i don't know if you've ever walked through one uh if you can walk through it um you know they're
they have two employees it's true they're the aisles are really cluttered yeah it's actually really
annoying i have like because i was in one the other day with my with my baby and it was like it was
actually hard to get through sorry i'm just saying it's fine but i mean they have two employees in the
store uh so they're not really you know putting a lot of people to work anywhere but they too use
their volume same way as walmart with these manufacturers to not only get a better cost
but to make the manufacturer produce certain items that are not available to anyone else and it goes back
to that that trade that class of trade i talked about earlier because we get that used against us all
the time if we want a club pack that was the that was the trade group i forgot to mention earlier
like the sams or the costcos if you if i want one of those trade packs oh i'm sorry that's for the club
this club segment oh i want this smaller bottle you know dish liquid or whatever it is oh that's the
dollar channel size and so a lot of times we don't even have the opportunity to carry the same items
that our competitors carry because they classify them for a different class of trade you know
know i do a lot of top to top meetings with all our manufacturers we sit down and look at our year
in review where our business is how do we grow it and what's been impacting us you know one of the
most interesting things when we go we talk about subsidizing walmart or the dollar channel it's how
we subsidize the manufacturer and what i say by that is nine out of ten times if the manufacturer produces
100 100 items we carry 85 but you go to walmart they only carry 40 and so we are selling another
40 different items at different margins to help subsidize the p and l of that manufacturer because
one of the things that we have always tried to do in the independent world is to offer a variety to the
consumer that walks in again we're getting our brains beat out on pricing so we got to give them great
meat great produce great service and variety to try to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace
so when you look at that and i remind the vendor when i'm visiting with them we're carrying your full
line but yet you allow walmart to carry half of the items i'm carrying but yet you're letting them beat
my brains out on those 40 items and i and i'm having to subsidize you as a vendor with these other items
that are not as competitive so you're making more margins off of us and we're supporting that habit
and you know i think we got to somewhat sometimes we need to look at that you know maybe we need to
carry 40 items but at the end of the day we still try to hang our hat on try to differentiate ourselves
with variety in the marketplace yeah the thing about the dollar store is they will you know they'll come
into a community of like 1200 let's say there's an iga grocery store and they will file a zoning permit
under a grocery store designation and locate like in the same shopping center or across the street
they're also able to expeditiously get a snap license a food stamp license so they can process
food stamp benefits even though they really do the bare minimum when it comes to fresh and perishability
and then they'll go to the manufacturer and say look we don't compete with the grocery store
so we want you know special pricing and we want special package size we want smaller package sizes
than the igas because we cater to a different type of customer base but of course to like a consumer
when you're experiencing high inflation you're going to cut across the parking lot to go to the dollar
store if if the product is cheaper so let's say there's a town of 1200 you need to sustain as much
volume as possible for that grocery store to be profitable so you have consumers being picked
off going to to the dollar store a lot of times that's the death knell for that community well and
again as we talked about earlier the supermarket in that town has to hire skilled labor i mean you have
to have meat cutters produce operators you have to skilled labor the dollar store needs two cashiers
and i'm saying i'm not saying a cashier is not skilled labor but you understand what i'm saying a
meat cutter and a produce manager is completely different so you're having to pay more for wages
and you're supporting that community with a lot more jobs but yet you're fighting to chris's point
packaging differences and what i mean by that we may carry a 98 ounce tide they get an 85 ounce
tide package for them and guess what the bottle looks the same it just has less liquid in it so to
the consumer's eye unless they're doing math by the ounce they don't realize that yeah they're three
dollars cheaper than we are but they got less product for it so they're paying less money but
they're just getting less that's shrinkflation right i mean well you you can call it that but
for the consumer you know if you got six bucks to spend well then that works for them right yep and so
but and when we go to the vendor saying hey we want as we refer to them in the market the cheater packs
hey we want some of those cheater packs to have that same price impression nope that's a dollar channel
that seems like a problem to be like we want a cheater we want a cheater pack i remember
like during the financial crisis they were like i was learning about finance at the time i was
started working in congress and they were like oh no the liar's loan segment has gone is going bad and
i was like well liars they're low maybe that's the problem that they're called liar's loans yeah it
seems not good um we want cheater packs yeah no it feels like that's actually a a form of deception
right which i mean when i say it feels i mean they're called i guess they're called cheater packs
we refer to them as cheater pack but think about it think about it in the average
or they're shopping although they'll have no idea as a value right as an average consumer i am a total
idiot and i will take the 85 cent one over the 99 cents i mean as well i mean some of your better
grocery stores actually put the per ounce price you know underneath the the price tag but i can't
believe that a lot of people look at that no they do not so so okay so i want to ask a different so
this is a i want to get to like one of my pet peeves um i'm a broken human being so my pet peeves are
not normal but it's credit card costs which seem like crazy if i put 20 if i give you a 20 bill
you get all 20 right if i take a if i want to charge 20 on my credit card you know whatever
one to three percent goes to visa mastercard and banks and then if my 20 bill is counterfeit you
have the secret service that deals with it if my credit card is uh there's some sort of identity
theft or something i have to deal with it or the store has to deal with it with insurance so it's like
you're getting you know that it's just like a private sales tax now i wonder do does walmart
do the dollar stores do they get better pricing on credit cards and then also is this a monopoly
that is or do you know triopoly or whatever you want to call it you know visa master credit score is
this something america express is this something that's a a a significant cost center to you guys
not i guess not your customers but your your your customers customers immersions yeah absolutely do
do is there a price discrimination element here as well there is matter of fact i think if you go look
at uh i forgot how long ago was chris where they pulled in visa mastercard into a hearing and they
actually asked that question and they really didn't want to answer truthfully that walmart got a better
rate transaction rate than we can get but they did said because they did say because of walmart size
that there are different uh contracts basically is how they worded it but our our average grocery store
that we service credit card fees is the second largest expense on their p l second only to labor expense
it's more than the electric bill a lot most cases more than their rent on the building
it's more than everything else except labor and what you know and and to your point if walmart's
getting a one percent or a half a percent transaction fee and i got a retailer sitting at three not only
is he getting his bane his brain bashed in on cost of goods from tide he's also paying another two to
two and a half percent more than walmart in the transaction to sell the tide that he's already too
high right yeah it's like you have a much higher question from worse that was actually a question
from republican senator josh holly and visa mastercard both admitted to giving discounts um on volume
arrangements to walmart but believe it or not this is an area where we you know you put our arms together
with walmart the dollar stores all the other merchants as a community because you know this is
a duopoly you've got eighty percent of of credit card processing goes through visa mastercard so they
can set prices they operate as a cartel you know if you're issuing bank they will discipline you if you
charge differently than default interchange so all that does is we're down to you know randy and his
customers don't have a choice in the matter they make a buck off of a hundred dollars worth of groceries
and if you're using one of those high rewards cards visa and mastercard are making two to four
dollars and it makes us crazy now i know chris there is legislation to to deal with this uh in
washington the credit card competition act's bipartisan bill um there were seeming attempts to get this
you know kind of wedge it into some other bill what is the state of play on that right now and uh you know
what are your the merchants that you work with doing to to try to get some more level playing
field there yeah i think we're expecting the bill to be introduced sometime soon congress just got back
into session after a break um we're obviously pushing for a vote on that i think the biggest
challenge that we have is that you know the banks have all of our money so they use that is a big challenge
so yeah they're using hundreds of millions of dollars to try to stop this and scaring
senators uh and staff you know they'll give they'll drive up a donut truck to the senate office
buildings and offer free donuts to staff or buy out a bar giving free drinks you know trying to
you know say don't vote on this bill because you know you're gonna miss you're gonna miss out on all
your rewards um well i live in washington dc so i like that i'm on the other side i'm on the other
side of that one from you but agree to disagree yeah i don't think so matt i i think you're getting
screwed too here so probably a hundred dollars a family i'm buying the cheater pack yeah and what i
think is so funny is that you know use our card and you get one percent cash back but they're charging
you three at the register right i don't want to hear it one percent cash back yeah i just no i'm getting
cash back it's i like the cash back idea yeah but you still i think you're paying for it and cost
the goods well that's what they call a two-sided market there we have to we have to raise our costs
to accommodate those you know three percent transaction costs and so the people who actually
lose in this trend transaction are are the the lowest income so if you ultimately the snap card or
cash or a debit card you don't have the same level of transaction fees you're still paying that at
that higher price that otherwise would be lower sure if we had lower uh costs in terms of our so
so so this is kind of like painting a picture of kind of at almost every level being an independent
grocer you're getting you have a disadvantage vis-a-vis somebody who's large and powerful
and is closer to wall street right and you know they probably get i know i've read this they've got
tax subsidies for you know because the town you talk about how the towns will call you to get a
grocer in there but they will also give tax subsidies to dollar store to get someone in there
right and so there's all sorts of you know there's all sorts of um uh of advantages i know
i saw walmart is often in electric utility rate dockets so there are there are whole there are
elements here where they're trying to get cost advantages in every context that doesn't have
anything to do with efficiencies but i guess i want to get to a slightly different i want to move
back to something we talked about earlier in the interview which is where you said you're not back to
where you were prior to the pandemic and i guess um you know do you still have problems sourcing
things like baby formula or other items that and then i guess that's not a pandemic thing but that
was like a you know what are you having trouble getting what's interesting about the baby formula
that's what two years ago we had that issue yeah we're still getting 40 of what we order
40 40 40 service level two years later which i cannot i just can't understand why and what are
some of the other products that five years after the pandemic you're still struggling to do
believe it or not the pet food category is probably the worst really the pet food category is probably
the worst if you walk into an independent store we have holes in the shelves everywhere in the pet food
category or we've had to change our mix of products and certain of the items we're carrying and carrying
things that are not as popular as i refer to it to the consumer that uh the big brands are however
however i can go into walmart or i can go into attractive supply or i can go into a dollar general
or i can go into a club store and find those items that we can't get our hands on
so is when you talk about baby formula that is just shocking you get 40 of what you ask for or
to order is it is it like you can't get the specialty baby formulas or just all baby formulas
all baby formula in general and what what do they tell you when you're like what you only gave me 40
of what i ordered what do they say uh capacity problems do you think it's capacity problems or
what's going on there well i don't know what to believe anymore you we've been told so many
different things in the last two years you know again they use capacity issues the demands higher
than the capacity i mean that's really odd so but i mean that's that's yet another level because as you
say if they're available you know maybe not baby farm but the the the pet food or whatever if they're
available in bigger stores but you can't get your hands on them that's yet another way where this is
kind of sliced up it's called allocations allocations i mean everything is a conspiracy
theory like why aren't they just giving you what you ordered after this is crazy i feel like everything
is like the cia holding onto the jfk papers it's like crazy it's not uh sorry i'm gonna calm down
i mean this goes back to what we found during covid like the reason that they're not shorting product to
their largest customers is because the largest customers will find them well they're fine find some
way to discipline them for not doing it randy does not have the bargaining power they don't have the
leverage they just have to take as much as they can possibly buy and um you know we don't have buying
power and i know there was an ftc paper about this very issue um i think feeding the american in a time
of prices is what it was called and uh you know it sounds like some of these issues at least have not been
completely aggressed addressed and and chris i know that you're you're involved with something
called the main street coalition which you know i think in part is based on on this discrepancy could
you could you tell us about that and is there a possibility sort of in greater numbers to uh try to
remedy some of these things yeah i'll start with the covet example and there was a report that the ftc put
out a couple years ago explaining the market dynamics here but just a painted picture for you you go into
one of randy's you know customer stores independent brochure and you go to the paper aisle we all
remember being terrified when we could get toilet paper but like fortunately for you as a consumer
i don't use toilet papers there you go i just don't i don't like it yeah but you could drive 20
miles down the road to a walmart and then they would have paper to the sky the funny thing about that
this is what got us involved that re-involved in starting the main street coalition which i'll get to
is that it didn't make any sense because if you think of the consumer at that time
they felt a lot more comfortable going into their local grocery store versus fighting each other for
toilet paper at walmart and we had data that suggested that our sales growth was almost double
that of the big box segment so randy would go to the proctors and gambles of the world and say
what the heck we can move product for you faster and make you more money like why can't we get any
why are you telling us there's no product and they would just look at him with these blank stares well
what they would do chris is they say well no we based your allocations on the last 52 weeks of purchases
well that's wonderful except now we're moving twice as much in a short period of time
because the consumer is scared to death to go to a big store and get coveted right right
but it didn't matter at walmart they use walmart's movement for the last 52 weeks yeah and wasn't
there something wasn't there something on toilet paper specifically where they said oh well you have
to get a 96 pack or there was like something like a very large quantity yes i like yeah i mean they
consolidated their manufacturing which may be more efficient but it you know unfortunately for us they
consolidated around a skew a product that only the big box segment can purchase and right inconvenient for
us but like you know we would have purchased 96 packs that would have been fine like we just
wanted to get it to the customer that's that's all here's what was crazy david yeah so they would
say hey we're only going to produce 60 pack toilet paper right and we're going to allocate it and we look
and you never carried out 60 so you don't get any but you're that's all you're selling well it was
a item walmart carried so walmart gets well i'm sorry i can't give you allocations because you bought
none from us now now i'm as crazy as matt is like everything is it's very it's very soviet but one
of the things that i think i i i can't help but thinking that you know you're on the cons you're
on the retail side right and you're one of the littler uh the small you know you're reasonable size
but you're not but you're one of the smaller buyers compared to a dollar store or uh you know um
or walmart or something like that but there have to be producers that are on the other side that are also
smaller right and they're you know so they must be seeing like it's not like you're gonna it's it's
not like you could go to a non-procter and gamble producer of toilet paper or or detergent or whatever
or maybe you could i don't know um why why isn't there competition in terms of vendors um to to why
wasn't there where you could get toilet paper that maybe wasn't there was but you you got you know uh
proct and gamble is a big one actually shorman then you have scott and then you have cotton
nail and you have angel soft and all of those folks had the same way of doing business every
single one of them and there's no entrance into the market i mean is on the other side like uh in
terms of vendors it's hard to get it's hard to break in on that side too but we even have our own brand
our own private label and private label manufacturers were doing the exact same thing that the branded
manufacturers were doing because you only have a couple of guys that produce private label toilet
paper in the country really and they produce it for everybody so then guess what the big guy wins again
so even though it was our own brand they wouldn't set you on the on the line so there's because walmart
was taking the majority of the lines so there's like a private label but sort of an oligopoly
yeah pretty well trust me there's a lot of this on the private label side as well i think private
labels are fascinating i mean you know sometimes it's the exact same product we've i've seen videos
where people like do the chemical tests on two products one's supposed to be generic and one's
supposed to be you know whatever and it's the same product that's usually given to different market
segments but what you're saying there is that you know even if it's your own private label product you
can't get your own private label product because they're still tied up with the suppliers and that
has to do with the fact that yeah there's kind of like concentration on that side and they're worried
about the walmart's of the world too absolutely you know we opened a water plant because of a
manufacturer not taking care of us during covid you know we niagara which is one of the biggest bottle
waters you know throughout the country we were buying now listen to this we're buying 110 truckloads a week
a hundred and ten truckloads a week of water they cut us to ten to ten oh man so we couldn't have
bottled water for our customers go to walmart tons of water all right forced us to open our own water
plant and kick their you know what so we kicked them out of the warehouse we have the lowest cost on
water for our members now and we produce 150 truckloads a week and we are making great money on the water
water so i i always tell the guy thank you when i see him yeah thank you for not taking care of our
business thanks for cutting my water out yeah we had a better solution yeah i think where we saw
shortages it you know since covid it's really been in these areas where there's consolidation um you know
there's just less redundancies in the supply chain and the bigger these these companies get the more
addicted they become to the strength of walmart and it's at walmart and at at the retail consolidation
level is where we see consolidation stemming from upstream because as a manufacturer you have to scale
up you've got to buy the new entrance you've got to you know you have to have some power in the supply
chain you have to accommodate the scale that walmart is demanding from you and sometimes in the food
marketplace you know who does that come at the expense of it comes at the expense of the farmer
you know farmers have fewer places to sell their goods um you know you've got four major meat packers
for example you've got fewer fewer fewer buyers but you know we see this consolidation happening because
the the relentless consolidation at the retail level is is just causing this to filter upstream
so okay i want to i want to close this out because i've i found this interesting we could keep talking
for hours um and uh but i want to ask a little bit about the politics here because this is a weird
political sort of area right anti-monopoly politics is always weird because it's kind of pro-business
so it it kind of codes right wing but it's also like you know there's all sorts of issues of power
asymmetries so that there are sort of lefty elements to it and no one really talked has centered it as
their kind of core thing um so i guess i want to ask about you know is robinson-pappen historically is
a is a rural is kind of a rural issue um not you know not because it doesn't matter to people in cities
but because it's just it that's that's where the political base has always come from um how does this
issue intersect with partisan politics who supports the revival of the robinson-patman act in the
regulatory agencies in the states in congress who is affected by the failure to enforce price
discrimination laws um talk about the politics of the of the grocery business yeah i mean i think the
beauty of this and why we've been able to have success in reviving it and building bipartisan support
is because it's inherently in a both rural and urban issue independent grocers are the ones that
are in the inner cities and we're the ones that are in the rural areas so we find strange allies
sometimes that come together to support you know leveling the playing field so that you know small
towns can continue to have a grocery store or we don't have these urban food desert phenomenons um
and so that that's that's played well from those members you know they saw what happened during
covid they saw that they couldn't get toilet paper and you know that they needed for their family
um and we you know it pointed to this bigger issue of discriminatory pricing um that plus the fact that
you've got farm country which is really hurting right now and they're waking up they really woke up after
the kroger albertson's merger particularly the producer groups who sell more domestically which
had you know happens to be more protein more produce products those are more domestic markets more
than the retail they're seeing their customers shrink and when you see your customers shrink you've
got fewer buyers which means you you know you don't have any pricing power in the marketplace so
farmers are struggling so they are seeing consolidation at retail being a a major problem
for their business and then you relate this back to to the big issues that animated antitrust in the
first place in the 30s and and before that labor you know we have a lot of studies pointing to when
walmart comes into a market they suppress wages there's declines in income so labor likes this
issue and then you know the other retail areas where there's been a lot of problems you guys have
spent a lot of time on your podcast on this the same dynamics that we see in grocery are happening in
pharmacy pharmacy you know pharmacy shutting down have been supercharged recently um so obviously
that's a hot political issue for members of congress who are they don't want to see their local
pharmacy close um but that has to do with the fact that there's consolidation there's vertical
you know arrangements between pbms health insurers and pharmacies where they're able to essentially use
that that that vertical growth and that size to advantage themselves at at the disadvantage of
the independent pharmacy so this issue pervades i think retail um and you know we the other piece
of it is we've been successful at establishing a coalition main street competition coalition you
can find us at mainstreetcompetition.com we are are basically a group of restaurants pharmacies hotels
bookstores convenience stores even online sellers and agriculture producers and we're all uh preaching
the same thing which is we need to revive robinson padman we need to provide some level of a level
playing field for um you know retailers and bring back main street i mean i think at the end of the
day folks uh in this in this kind of time in our politics they're seeing a decline in in main street
retailers succeeding and that's really what this issue is all about it's all about uh the ability
of small businesses to compete fairly in a market and and i think that you know what we do see is that
people people people want that people love their stores they love their their independent businesses
and you know and they they work more efficiently like you see what randy was able to do like i'll
i'll start my own water plant and i'll uh you know i'll deliver this at a better price well
look chris jones national grocers association and main street uh competition coalition uh and randy arsenault
uh uh independent grocer wholesaler thank you so very much for being on organized money well thank you for
having us appreciate it you know it really strikes me that what we are talking about here is and i
think i said this up top but what we're talking about here is the tyranny of the dollar store or the
tyranny of walmart right at every level if you are just trying to make a go of it you are just
disadvantaged by someone who has access to capital and that is not how it's ever been in america and
what it's crazy is that the most creative people the people who have to figure out these ways to be the
most efficient are really only doing it so they can eke out a living relative to walmart or these
giant dollar stores they're not those savings don't go to the customer those savings go so they can
survive i was totally struck by you know if you put your capital into a local store right i'm gonna put
my capital and my labor in there and i make one dollar off of every hundred dollars in sales at visa makes
three dollars off of every hundred dollars in sales off of my investment right that's doing next to
nothing doing nothing literally just as a uh uh like moving a something you know some i'm moving a
digit in a in a spreadsheet from one place to the other it's this thank you for i'm that from me me
incompetent you're sputtering after this interview you're just sputtering i'm sputtering but you can
see the the uh like yosemite sam you see you know like dollar signs and exclamation points coming out
so here's here's the basic view i think i'm coming to to believe which is that lewis brandeis called um
called it other people's money that was a common expression in the 19th century he said the way to get
rich in an unethical way is to use other people's money for speculation or other forms of of um or
stealing it or whatever this very much seems to me like as we're looking at this kind of ecosystem
of monopoly surrounding people who work for a living or who have some form of real business
they are exploiting other people's money right they are cream skimming whether it's you know the
the vendors whether it's walmart whether it's the credit card companies whether it's you know tax breaks
whatever it is there's a cream skimming here from the people who work for a living and i think that's
what we're learning throughout all of these episodes but this one in particular well it was great to
talk to randy and it was great to talk to chris um and we're going to have another great episode for
you next week on organized money organized money
