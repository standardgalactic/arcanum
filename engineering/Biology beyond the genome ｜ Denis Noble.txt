It means that getting an Oprah Prize doesn't guarantee that you will be listened to.
So, biology beyond the genome.
And for those of you who are book addicts,
the music of life is the first one that actually used the subtitle Biology Beyond the Genome,
and you'll understand that when I talk about the talk today.
And there is a forthcoming book due out next month from Cambridge University Press,
Understanding Living Systems.
So, because you are a very general audience, I'm going to say a word or two about what is the genome.
And it is, of course, a very long, thin thread in all the trillions of your cells.
It's a thread of molecules called nucleotides, because they're molecules that sit in the nucleus.
Most of them, anyway.
There happen to be just four types.
A, T, G and C.
That's all you need to know.
In you and me, the genome contains three billion of those in every single one of your cells,
except for our red blood cells.
Now, important point, they are chemicals.
And those of you who know your chemistry will know that chemicals can only do what chemicals can do.
They do what chemicals automatically do.
And they like to bind together in pairs.
A likes to be with T and G with C.
Those are chemical attractions dependent upon the energies in those molecules.
And in doing this, they have no choice.
They cannot, therefore, be described as selfish, either metaphorically or literally.
Only organisms, you, me, and the cat and the bacterium, only they can be described as selfish or cooperative.
And in case you're wondering, we're not born selfish either.
A baby cannot be born selfish.
It simply has needs, food and care to enable it to live, grow and flourish.
And it slowly learns that it can choose.
Now, a bit of size comparison.
If I enlarged a nucleotide from one of our genomes to the size of my fist, the size of a golf ball,
the living cell would be the size of the United Kingdom.
And if the nucleus were here in hay, and here's the nucleotide, the edge of the cell would be way up there in Scotland.
You'll see the significance of this very soon.
And part of what I want to get across to you today is that focusing on genome sequencing,
you can all go and buy your genome from 23andMe, I'm not supposed to do adverts, that's okay.
Anyway, focusing on genome sequencing is a little bit like mistaking the pixels for the message.
I've put here, we wish them all well, because that's the ending of my new book coming up next month,
Understanding Living Systems.
And if we looked at that message and expanded it up just a little bit,
nowhere near the degree to which we'd have to represent the difference between a nucleotide
and the edge of the cell up in Scotland, all we can see are pixels.
We no longer understand the message.
At sufficient magnification, therefore, the meaning is no longer evident.
And that is true for you and me and all organisms that have to read their genomes in order to make proteins.
We don't understand what the C, G, A and T mean.
We don't need to, either.
So, how did the genome become described around the year 1980,
so over 40 years ago now, as the book of life,
creating as body and mind, of course, if you want to follow Richard.
And if that were so, there's a very simple test.
The conditional logic of life would have to be found in the genome.
Now, I write computer programs.
That's how I worked out, just 63 years ago,
how your pacemaker mechanism works in the heart.
I wrote a computer program to represent that on an old valve computer.
I know what computer programs have got to have in them.
They've got to have the conditional clauses, the if, then, else clauses.
And if you look for those in the genome, you will not find them anywhere in the genome.
The genome has switches.
Every gene, every part of the sequence that needs to be read to make proteins or RNAs,
those have switches.
But the control of those switches is elsewhere.
It's not in the genome itself.
And I want here to recommend an article which came out in a journal that I edit,
Progress in Biophysics, just a couple of years ago, by Keith Bavastock.
He wrote an article, The Gene and Appraisal.
You can find it on the internet without too much difficulty.
He wrote,
The gene plays a passive role as a vital information store.
It enables us to make all the proteins we need, all the RNAs we need.
But it is the phenotype, that is you and me, that plays the active role.
So where are life's control routines?
I'm a cellular electrophysiologist in origin.
And I can tell you where they are because that's where the if-then-else clauses are.
That's where the code, if you want to call it that, lies that enable us to make choices.
Those are our conditional on-off switches.
They're in the membranes of our cells and their protein channels.
Without those membrane processes, there could not be choice in response to electrical and chemical signals.
And choice is an essential element of any theory on what it is to be selfish or cooperative.
Moreover, all our nerve cells have those on-off switches, the channels that enable it to be possible.
And furthermore, there are no genes for any of those membranes.
All the lipids that form the membranes and the complicated structures that you can see in a typical cell,
none of that is coded for in the genome.
All of that is inherited.
Now, go back to the genome.
Each triplet, that is three nucleotides,
corresponds in the translation mechanism in your cells and mine,
to an amino acid and a protein.
For example, AGC enables the amino acid serine to be selected.
Don't worry if you don't know what serine is.
It doesn't matter too much.
Now, this is what is often called the genetic code.
But as Bavastock's article makes crystal clear, it's not a code.
It's a template.
It's simply something that enables something else to be made.
As I said earlier on, there is simply no code of life or program of life in the genome.
And so I'm now going to unravel the four major common misunderstandings
that have infected our understanding of what it is to be a living system,
which is what the new book coming out by Cambridge next month is about.
There are four.
The first is the central dogma of molecular biology,
which is the idea that there's simply one way of causation,
all the way from those gene sequences to the proteins, to the body,
and therefore to you and me,
and which then determine whether we are selfish or cooperative.
The second is the Weissman barrier.
That's the idea that the future eggs and sperm
are not influenced by what we learn as organisms during our lifetime.
That's the idea there's a complete separation of the germline
away from the body as a whole.
The third one is that DNA just replicates itself.
It does so like a crystal.
And the fourth is therefore the idea that the replicator and the vehicle,
that's the cells in your and my body, are completely separate.
And that's, of course, the central idea of the selfish gene.
I'm just going to go briefly through each of those.
First of all, the central dogma.
Francis Crick formulated this in 1958,
and then he reformulated it in 1970.
We don't need to go into the detail of that.
What you need to know is that it's real
when it is taken to refer to a simple chemical fact
that DNA sequences are used by living cells
to make amino acid sequences forming proteins.
But it is illusory and completely misleading
when taken to exclude control of the genome
and its reorganization by living systems.
Now, the evidence that reorganization of genomes
has occurred during evolution,
during the evolution of us too,
was one of the major discoveries
of the first sequencing of the human genome
in the year 2001.
It is in the Nature paper
when the first human genome sequence was announced
to grand fanfares over in Washington
and over here in London.
Now, the point about that
is that very few people seem to know
that what figure 42 in that article in Nature in 2001 shows
is that in the evolution of some of the key proteins
in our bodies,
as you go through the various species
from a bacterium
through to yeast
through to more complex organisms
like a mouse
through to us as humans,
they have formed themselves
by accretion of chunks of protein
to form proteins with more and more functionality.
That means, of course,
that the organisms as they developed
and as they evolved
must have known how it was possible
to move this chunk of DNA over there
to put it in connection
with that bit over here
and so on and so forth.
If you calculate the probability
that that could happen by chance,
it would not just take
the 13 billion years of the universe,
it would take even more than that.
It's extremely improbable
that that could have occurred by chance.
So, the first point I make
is that there is clear
and hard evidence
that it must be the case
that organisms are capable
of reorganising their genomes
in response to stress.
Moreover, that's an old discovery.
It was found by Barbara McClintock
working on corn,
the plant,
way back in the 1940s,
published in genetics
during the 1950s,
eventually given the Nobel Prize
in 1983
and then she was completely ignored.
It means that getting a Nobel Prize
doesn't guarantee
that you will be listened to.
That's another problem.
Okay, that's the central dogma.
Finished.
There is no central dogma.
The Weissmann barrier,
that's the,
it's named after August Weissmann,
the German geneticist
who introduced the idea.
He introduced it primarily
to exclude from Charles Darwin's ideas
the idea that the body
could communicate
to the future egg and sperm.
So, it was introduced
precisely to remove
an important aspect of evolution
that Darwin himself favoured.
Now, today,
his idea
how this could happen,
he speculated,
you see,
somehow,
if my body changes,
it must be possible
that information
gets transmitted
to the sperm and egg cells.
So, he said,
there must be tiny particles
that cells give off.
Well, he knew that was the case
because even in the 19th century,
people knew
that little particles
were pushed off by cells.
He called them gemmules.
We found them.
They're today called
extracellular vesicles
or exosomes.
What do they do?
They carry RNAs
that control the genome
for its metabolic activities
and so on
to the germline.
That has been demonstrated.
Now,
the Weissmann barrier,
therefore,
there never was
any good evidence
for it, incidentally,
and I'm happy
in question time
if you want me
to justify that statement.
