Oh hello and welcome and welcome back to another year and just to say what a delight it is to be
back now I'm going to talk about something really important in a minute I'm going to talk about the
lazy why the fact that I think we are generally too easily content with one explanation for
anything then traveling in on the train I suddenly had an idea about how to solve social media so I
thought I'd talk about that instead now the great commentator Thomas Sowell said that political
activism is simply a way for useless people to feel important and it suddenly occurred to me it
is too easy to express opinions on social media without any particular grounding or without making
any contribution to the wider society so I decided the solution to social media if Elon's listening
is simply to create a new social medium where every opinion you post has to be accompanied by
a useful solution and only when you get enough votes for the solution does your opinion get published so
there you are you have a cost of entry in order to express an opinion you have to do something useful
first so I think that's a fair principle to establish here so today before I start talking about a wider
an important philosophical question I'm going to talk about the problem of commemorative benches
which I spotted only a week ago okay now I've got a flattened deal down on the Kent coast and one thing
deal doesn't have a problem with is places to sit in fact the capacity of the commemorative benches along
the seafront probably exceeds the population of the town even at peak season okay by contrast when I go to
London Bridge station which costs something like 750 million pounds there's absolutely nowhere to
sit and I was trying to work out why this complete uneven distribution was occurring and I realized
there's a feedback loop isn't there right because if you look at commemorative benches there's a
fundamental logical problem what they typically say is in memory of uncle Bob dates who always lived loved
sitting in this spot right now don't know if you've spotted this slight problem I don't like to pick
apart the thought processes of the recently bereaved but the very fact that he loved sitting in this spot
probably means that there was already a place to sit okay and therefore by definition that is not a
place where you need to supply a chair by contrast okay places where you don't love sitting because there's
nowhere to sit are completely unfurnished so I think what we need to do is just rewrite that line okay
and my children have instructions that if ever I die there's going to be a bench at platform 5 of
London Bridge station it says in memory of Rory Sutherland who could never find anywhere to
fucking sit here now you can solve problems but you've got to spot them first you've got to spot the
asymmetries the inequalities that disproportionate attention given to one thing rather than another
and this is what brings me I think to billion-dollar behaviors and it goes back to a meeting that took
place in Napa Valley in about 2008 and it was a mixture of Daniel Kahneman speaking about his latest
findings on behavioral science but present along with a lot of great behavioral scientists like I think
Richard Thaler for example were pretty much you know about a quarter of the unicorns at that time from
Silicon Valley Larry was there Sergey was there I'm using first names just to flatter your own recognition I don't
know them personally okay Jeff Bezos was there etc I think Sean was there from Facebook Sean Parker was there from
Facebook and as Daniel Kahneman presented most of these people actually drank in what he had to say
and realized that if he was right and he probably mostly was this had huge implications for their
business and I think they were right to think that and shortly thereafter you had actually Jeff Bezos
talking about you know machine learning algorithms that could generate 70 you know 70 million nudges in a
day for example but the most interesting take I think in the whole evening was a behavioral scientist called John
Kenny and he was sitting in the room and he suddenly had an epiphany which was that it was actually
behavioral science that an only behavioral science that could explain why the people sitting around him were
billionaires in other words if we want to understand what it is that made Google
successful rather than say ask Jeeves okay if we wanted to understand what it was that made these
organizations disproportionately successful the answer more commonly lay in a behavioral explanation than in
a technological explanation I think it was a very interesting observation from John Kenny he's a very
brilliant decision scientist and thinking about that how often how much time how much effort do we spend in
business looking at what succeeds and going deeper into the question of why now if you want me to
summarize very shortly what I think is wrong with business today there's a bit too much Taylorism and
there's not enough Druckerism okay in other words there's too much quantification of what it what already is
and there's too little speculation exploration experimentation about what could be and it occurs to me that if you look at the
extraordinary effort we put into data collection that seems to me completely unmatched by corresponding effort
looking for interesting causation and I set out to wonder why that might be why is it that we make so little effort
to consider what might be alternative explanations and I think what I call this is the hyperactive what and the lazy why
that we put an enormous amount of energy into measuring things quantifying things assembling effectively statistics for presentation upwards within the organization for presentation to stockholders for the construction of narratives to stockholders but actually the effort that goes into the assembling of all this information isn't matched by commensurate effort in asking what the causality might be
and then I thought of the oldest question in behavioral science which is why did the chicken cross the road and I noticed that in this question okay there are always two assumptions the assumptions are that there's only one chicken and there's only one reason and what we tend
and I think the explanation for this might come down to the work of people like Dan Sperber and the argumentation hypothesis that actually as human beings we haven't really
inherited or evolved the brains of scientists what we've inherited is the brains of lawyers
and what I was always taught in negotiation training is that if you have one good reason to say no advance that one good reason then shut up okay
in other words if you have a great alibi if you have a single conclusive case for the defense you make that case and then you stop you don't go on adding other reasons because if one of your supplementary reasons is weak the opposition will then pick that apart
and I think something there I think explains quite a lot of human behavior I think by the way the greatest application as yet for behavioral science won't be in understanding individual consumer behavior
which is fairly naturally where it has its beginnings because apart from anything else that's where it's easiest to measure
I think the really big value for behavioral science will ultimately come from understanding social behavior but also from understanding institutional behavior
because we always have this view I think that individual consumers when they make decisions are biased but then when you put a lot of consumers
behind a desk in an office in a workplace and you put them around a room in a meeting somehow those biases even out
I don't think that's true I think sometimes those biases actually become amplified
and so understanding what's going on in collective default decision making in terms of our approach to causality and reasoning seems a really important area for inquiry
and what we see time and time again is what I call this lazy why that once there is a satisfactory rational explanation
we deliver that and then with our brain says right got that move on nothing to see here
and I think it's a very very dangerous assumption that there's only one chicken and there's only one reason why it crossed the road
I'll give you a couple of examples of this let's take a sale okay you're all familiar with it everywhere in the world shops will have a sale
and if you went to an economist and said why do you think shops are crowded during the sale okay they will say because the prices are lower
and that by the way is perfectly true it's an absolutely reasonable and accurate answer but is it the whole truth
and this is the distinction I want to make because I think if we delve a little bit deeper into what a sale is okay
I think you'll notice about three different things going on yes there are lower prices okay
now I have a vague contention that if you actually staged a sale and put loads of signs up saying stay a sale
and you paid actors to queue outside the shop okay that even without reducing the prices you would create a fairly significant uptick in demand okay
I think that's possible I also think it's true to say that if you simply cut your prices and didn't create the theatre around the sale
by putting stickers in the window and by creating an air of desperation
I think in that case I think in that case actually to be honest you wouldn't sell that much more
I think there are multiple things going on I think it's a lollapalooza effect
I think there are multiple behavioural things happening in combination and we will be much better off if we try and understand more than one of them
but what we tend to do is we default to the first plausible rational explanation exactly as a defence law might do
okay we've got that point answered that's it done nothing to see here
and so in the sale I think there are multiple things going on I think there are lower prices
I think there's also scarcity value because implicit in the idea of a sale is something very different from ordinary shopping
which is once it's gone it's gone
there is implicit in it the idea of scarcity the idea that actually these are the end of line things from the last season
and there is a limited number of them available and there is also a huge amount of social proof going on
one of the really important things about physical retail is it puts you in an environment where lots of people are shopping
which therefore makes shopping seem fundamentally normalised okay
and I think sales without the crowds without the queues don't have the same value as sales which are effectively the product of all three of those things in parallel
now I've always wanted to do just in alignment with this I've always wanted to do an experiment
which is when you have 50% extra free on something whether it's a bottle of shampoo or it's a chocolate bar or anything else
how much of the extra purchase that results comes from the price change and how much of it comes from the sense that there's a deal
okay how much of it may come from salience the fact that you know the other shampoo or the other chocolate bars or the other soaps or the other soap powders
don't have an interesting bright red flash on them but this one does
I always wanted to do that experiment but then I realised that of course to do that experiment would be completely illegal
because it would actually entail claiming that something was cheaper or on offer while keeping the price basically unreduced
and I asked this question once to someone not an Ogilvy client I hasten to add
but someone in a very large client organisation they said we already know the answer to that question
I said how on earth can you know the answer to that question it's completely illegal to do the experiment
you know to do that experiment what you'd have to do is put 50% extra free on a box of soap powder
and then put the price up by 50%
how can you possibly do that?
and they said very simply by mistake about once or twice every few years someone fails to key in something into a spreadsheet
and so there's a great box of something on the shelf and it says 50% extra free
and the price has gone up by 50% there's actually no saving
I said well what happens?
he said I can't give you exact figures he said but basically you wouldn't believe it
to be honest the sales go up by almost as much as if you left the price where it was before
now that's an interesting finding because it suggests the why of what's going on in a price value equation
is rather more complicated and rather more nuanced than simply comparing utility to the sticker price of the object
it strikes me as very very interesting because what it suggests is there is a value in feeling that you are getting
compared to some baseline measure a better deal than you would have done last week
a better deal than you'll get next week or a better deal than your mate is getting down the road
there's some value to that relative perception it isn't just about a price value equation
there's some little element of kind of game theory going on in the process as well
now the reason I think it's really important to do this kind of thing is because not only because
well two things actually why unlike what generates ideas
if you ask you can answer lots and lots and lots of what questions you can compile a lot of statistics
you can get a lot of factual information
generally there are exceptions and you know brilliant statisticians can do this
but mostly it doesn't generate the kind of insights that really generate interesting and new ideas
okay on the other hand if you come up with an interesting why you're probably 75% there
it's a wonderful thing that if you can actually reframe the question
if you can ask a different question or come up with a different explanation
the likelihood that it generates a creative solution which mostly will work but certainly will be worth testing
is just inordinately higher why is inordinately more valuable than what
and yet businesses spend 90% of their time effectively asking a what
and the reason it matters so much is because if you get the why wrong through a lazy assumption
it leads to a huge amount of misdirected effort
so I'll give you an example of this which I think has been wonderfully corrected
but it took more or less a lifetime of work by a man called Dr David Metz
who is the Chief Scientific Officer for the UK Department of Transport
every single transport measure was based on an assumption which is why do people want faster forms of transport
and in every case for decade after decade the assumption was to save time
the models that actually justified transport investment were effectively predicated on the fact
that anybody in transit was economically useless economically inert
and therefore the more time they had to do things which weren't travelling
the greater the economic and value they would enjoy
and Metz spent years looking at what people actually did when they got access to faster transport
he discovered something very strange which is hugely important
because the whole of transport policy changes once you understand this
which is basically whatever forms of transportation you give people
and this pretty much goes back to the Roman era
other than people obviously who are professional drivers
or who have very unusual circumstances
most people are pretty happy to spend one hour to maybe 70 minutes a day
pootling about the place
and if you give them new forms of transportation that are faster
they do not use it to save time
they use it to travel further afield
they use it to maximise opportunity
to maximise the places they can go
the places they can work
the places they can live
okay
and so this interesting kind of ceiling in what is natural human behaviour
which is really something you know essentially innate and evolved
okay
it lies outside the field of conventional sort of economic maximisation thinking
can allow you now with a different why
to actually invent completely new forms of transportation or transit
so one of the things METS understands very well
is people care about in some ways you know two things
they care quite a lot about comfort
they also care about the predictability of driving time
that low variance in driving time really matters
now I would argue that perhaps for 50 or 60 years
the assumption about what transport was supposed to do
has actually massively killed what would have been interesting investment
in slow but dependable forms of transportation
because without a time saving
they couldn't actually see a benefit
and this is what I mean by the fact that if you can discover a new why
suddenly whole new solution spaces opens themselves up
in a way that's completely magical
I find this fantastic
and I think one of the vital things we have to do
is simply spend more time asking why
even when the ostensible answer seems to be obvious and complete
we need to spend more time looking for further and different explanations
and again as John Kenny discovered that explanation for why something is happening
probably lies somewhere in the field of behavioural science and psychology
there's a wonderful thing I think called Dobshanky's law in evolutionary science
which says nothing in nature makes sense except in the light of evolution
and to a great extent I'd extend that and say nothing much in business makes sense
except in the light of behavioural science
as I said last year not everything is behavioural science
but behavioural science is in everything
for a complete explanation of something
the non behavioural solution to any question which actually involves
collective or individual human behaviour and decision making
probably isn't cutting it
and as a result your failure to include it is narrowing your solution set
and limiting your creativity
because what generally provide creative constraints
and why is generally create creative springboards
I think that's a vital thing to understand
and so when we go back to that original and oldest question in behavioural science
why did the chicken cross the road
every single time we ask that question we have to consider two possibilities
there's more than one reason and there's more than one chicken
and maybe the chickens don't all have the same reason
once you do that you escape from the tyranny of averages
and suddenly new sunlit uplands of creative possibilities start to emerge
that's my promise to you
it's a promise it's a claim but since I solved the bench problem
okay at the beginning I think it's it's it's what you like like it's to say is an opinion
that I've now paid my dues to share
just one favour
