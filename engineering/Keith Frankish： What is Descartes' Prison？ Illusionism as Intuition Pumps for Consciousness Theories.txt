Keith thank you so much for joining me again as we were just chatting you were one of my first
guests and it was such an honor to have you and you've really influenced my career and me joining
this field so it's it's such a great pleasure to have you back well thank you I'm honored to play
that sort of role um it's um it's a great podcast pleasure to be involved with it I've I've been
curious to know how life has been since we last spoke because it's 2021 it's been such a long time
anything you'd like to share price before we begin the deep philosophical dissection
um well life keeps happening um
um quite a lot of things have happened since uh it's just at the end of the pandemic I think that
we that we that we talked first um and so coming out of that life seems to have um uh speeded up
rather or maybe it's just that I've slowed down um and so the children are growing up um Maria my
partner's doing lots of interesting things she's um she's currently has a fellowship from um Yale's
life worth living network uh to um uh explore what it is that makes uh for a flourishing life
um I'm not sure if she's going to tell me but um she's working on that um which a very interesting
project and she's focusing in particular on how you live a flourishing life in a world that's
increasingly dominated by uh intelligent technology and I think this is something that's we're all
we're all going to have to think a lot about um I suppose that's the biggest change that's happened
in those three years is this sudden um uh well I was going to say emergence but it's it's it has been
coming for some time but it's suddenly burst into public awareness uh the possibilities of deep
learning um obviously through things like chat GPT um and the potential benefits and and risks
um and threats that this poses and this is something that philosophers have suddenly um I like to say this
is the philosopher's moment this is the moment when we're suddenly needed because who can
who can who can advise society about um how to how to think about these things about the ethics
uh of them and about the if you like the metaphysics or at least the psychology of these things are
these do these do LLMs have um are they actually communicating with us do they have beliefs
um um do they uh are they are they performing intentional actions when they communicate when
they when they respond to us are they actually replying to our questions are they assisting us
uh advising us informing us it looks as if they are we're tempted to think of them that way as if
they're being helpful and so on but is that just an illusion I tend to think it is um and what are the
ways of having things that seem so like cooperative partners um but maybe aren't um so uh this seems
to me this is the moment maybe when philosophers are uh uh finally in public demand whether we can
rise to the occasion I don't know but there's a debate here I think that that everybody needs
to be involved in um it was one thing that my um another thing that has happened recently of course
that my my um intellectual hero my friend um and then it has uh has died earlier this year and
I know this was something that was um exercising him very much uh uh during the past few years he
was devoting most of his time to thinking about this about the race he was always looking forward um
and uh it it's difficult to say that it's the most urgent problem that we're facing we're facing so
many of them from climate change to political instability war and so on but it's certainly
one of the mix of big challenges that are facing us so that's certainly something that's happened
in the world and I suppose it's I'm trying in my little way to to respond to it too
there's at least two things you brought up there that I'd like to touch on one is are you familiar
with the work by Eric Schwitzke Bell I I I am yes indeed yeah because he talks about a lot ethics the
ethics of ethicists or the philosophy of philosophers and whether we are actually important for the for
these um topics of discussion because I think he found that if you take a group of ethicists together
and give them certain philosophical or ethical dilemmas they tend to do pretty much the
same as the average person which is fascinating work yes it's a it's up
I say this flippantly though there may be a serious point with it if um if someone had to make
an ethical decision that would affect me might affect my life perhaps well um uh who would I prefer
to make it um a trained ethicist philosopher ethicist or just somebody who um had had a lot of experience of
life and just lived a rich and um nice ordinary person if you like with a lot of experience um or would I
prefer someone who'd really thought through all the principles of it now it may be and perhaps some
ethicists would say this that the two would tend to converge I don't know but I think I would go for the
ordinary person the nice ordinary person um yeah it's a sort of Spock versus McCoy I suppose
um uh situation but yeah it's it's exactly where he's sort of headed with that thought I think is
that you can sort of you don't need that academic training to sort of have the wisdom involved with
making those decisions but I suppose in defense of ethicists they might say well we're not that's not
exactly that's not really what we're trying to what we're trying to do is to probe some of the
principles behind ethical thinking we're not trying we're not claiming to be great ethical people
we're trying to think about some of the principles behind ethical thinking principles which the ordinary
person might have internalized um and be intuitively following we're trying to make them explicit trying to
find the rationale behind it it's not enough just to say oh well trust uh um so-and-so they were wonderfully wise
and uh but person we want to know we we like to think there's some rational basis to our decisions
uh and even if the person can't articulate it themselves we feel there should be some
rational um basis for their decisions and I suppose ethicists might say that's what we're trying to
to unpick and uncover so maybe Eric's being a little a little hard on them um physician heal themselves
you know it's uh yeah it's the it's the um the the doctors who smoke most and live the unhealthy life
life uh like have unhealthy lifestyles yes yeah I mean I know that for sure because I know there's
times where I'm telling patients to sleep well exercise diet while I'm working like a 30 something
our shift it's like the irony is incredibly apparent um so but but then on top of that the second thing
I wanted to ask you was about Dan Dennett he's right behind you there's a beautiful picture of him
oh you see the picture that was in Crete yes a few years ago and he he sort of touched on this giving
us those intuition pumps in order to make us have the tools to make decisions that are better more informed
and yet such a great loss as I said you were one of those people when I was writing
my dissertation and obviously Dan two of you combined and then we worked on that together you assisted me
since we last spoke we've had a great loss anything you want to say about Dan
I I wrote a little piece just after he died um um which perhaps we could we could link to um yeah
for the institute of art and ideas um
um uh so much I could say and I it's it's interesting that uh people who knew Dan um I
I think we all had a each of us felt we had a very special relationship with him he he he
he was a wonderful person wonderful human being as well as a great philosopher um uh when it came to
academic battles he he didn't take any prisoners he could be um yeah yeah he if he thought somebody
was uh uh having there's a section in his autobiography on our academic bullies in which he certainly
doesn't doesn't doesn't pull any punches but for um towards younger people towards people who he felt
would benefit from his help and advice he was wonderfully supportive um and a wonderful friend
um I think that's what I miss more than I mean he's always been my intellectual hero but in the way
that that Dennett is there in the work and I can go back and revisit um uh Danettian ideas Danettian
themes he's left these with us and so we can continue to engage with that it's the person that
I miss more than anything um though of course the two were were inseparable and I think that's
that's I think that's that's something I've been saying about him that um I just made a separation
between um Dennett the philosopher and Dennett the man but you can't and that's that's the point that's
why he was such a good philosopher I think that that all of his activities he was he was deeply engaged
with life I mean he was a farmer he was a sailor um uh he enjoyed good company good conversation he enjoyed
um he was a a musician he was a sculptor he considered becoming a professional sculptor he
was deeply engaged with life in all its richness
and that's what made him such a good philosopher um because he had a huge context in which to see
things I mean I repeat this every time it's a thing that he often repeated with the the line from
Wilfred Sellers but the aim of the philosopher is to see how things in the broadest possible sense of the
term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term to see the big picture to see the pattern
in the noise if you like and I think he did that better this is a bold statement better perhaps than
any human being has ever done that's a very bold statement of course he had a huge inheritance to draw
he was born at a particular he would first to stress this he was born at a time when um
has uh there's a confluence I think of work in philosophy and emerging cognitive science computing
theory um neo-darwinism um work in evolutionary biology and it was a confluence of all of this
really exciting and revolutionary work and he was able to synthesize it in a way I think um synthesize it
in a way that perhaps no one else had been able to do and communicate it he was a great communicator
um so I think he perhaps I would say that he achieved Sellers aim better than anyone has done
to date and we're all in his doubt and what he would want us to do is to is to continue that
that um that journey that um that exploration I would sometimes say to him that I'd found things
in I'd found myself saying things or writing things that I thought were my ideas and then I'd
I'd reread something from perhaps that he'd written 40 years ago and found that anticipated there um and
he was never um displeased by that he was always delighted by that he said that's what he wanted to do
he wanted to feed into the the stream of of thinking about things and it was the the ideas that mattered
and the continuation of the ideas um so I think the most best tribute to him is this is to continue
in that spirit which doesn't necessarily mean agreeing with everything I said of course he wouldn't want
that either um but I think he he saw the big that he saw the pattern more clearly than
when anyone's down I have to say that um when when I first started doing this he was probably the
the person who got me into this like just genuinely one of the most iconic prolific thinkers that I could
think of when I was a kid just growing up reading his stuff and we chatted via email quite a few times
he always signed up with that dcd and um and he was we planned to have a podcast together and it never
came to fruition and it's so sad for me because I wish we got to chat I mean I never got the opportunity
to really pick his brain I don't think if I ever told you this but I once I almost considered calling
this podcast quite a few um non-illusionist uh listeners and viewers with that title
I I can see I can understand why people um um uh disagree with with with um with Dan um
um what I can't understand is why some people dismiss his work but I can't understand it's
if you think quality quality quality is a paper that can be dismissed uh quickly then go and read
it again and then read it again and then read it again uh Dan's work is deceptive in some ways it's
easy to read you don't have to struggle too much to to read it because he's a clear writer and it's easy
to think you've got the measure of the argument well he's just said that and so on they say yeah
no I don't agree now it's easy to fool yourself into thinking that you've that you've fully grasped
the argument and that you've seen through it I every time I read quite an inquiry I think I see
something new and it's something I'm not fully appreciated um maybe if you'd written in a more
obscure style the more um with um made reader work harder to get through the paper it would have
forced them to think a little harder um about what he was saying but he did them the the the favor of
writing easily but don't think that that means you can you can understand easily um you need to really
reflect on these um on the the the the intuition pumps that he uses them they bear thinking about
almost you see what he's asking us to do is he's not presenting your standard uh sort of bit of
analytic philosophy where it analyzes some uh a bit of language or he presents some uh organized deductive
argument with premises and you know formally valid and then he defends the payments he's not doing
that kind of thing he's asking you to look at things from a different angle um to try a diff on a
different pair of spectacles if you like um or to move to a different location to look at the landscape
that's a bit more of a Riley and metaphor maybe say you know come over here climb up this hill and see
how the landscape looks from this perspective and he can tell you what to do he can set out the um
the examples the intuition pumps the things that he's that he's using to try to get you to take
that view but then it's up to you to take the view and to look at the landscape from that perspective
you can come to the point he's suggesting you can climb up with it but if you don't look at the
landscape and explore how it looks from that perspective and how the things the the relations
between things appear different from there if you just stand there and sort of stubbornly look the
other way or something um tend to over i'm overextending this metaphor then you won't get the benefit of
it so uh it's in that way it's it's maybe more like something like a zen exercise that requires
it you don't okay here's a vicar study but if you're in the grip of one picture you don't get
um to appreciate another picture just by you know it's not like a flicking a switch you have to work
yourself into it work yourself out of the old way of thinking first and then into the new way of thinking
and i think this is something perhaps that that people they see that that that he's asking them
to give up an old way of thinking so about free will or consciousness or intentionality whatever
they see he's asking them to give up that and they think well okay i've got that he he he doesn't
think we should think of it that way so i'm lost so that means i don't have to be well i don't have
consciousness and all the foundations have gone oh god that can't be right so i must stick with where i
want but he's never doing that he's never saying give up that and just be a sort of nihilist no he's
saying there's another way that is does all the work that that one did and some more too that's a
better way and you've got to take that second part of the journey and get into the the the um the
the framework the picture that he's offering the alternative so on free will how people how can he
say he's a realist about free will given the disaster to give up this sort of view of what
free will of of what free will is well work your way into it and see um so yeah i think some of the
dismissive aspects of all people's views on dennett in general stem from the fact that he obviously
was one of the four horsemen who just became at religion with so much vigor and and life that
many people just associate him with that only and they purely dismiss any philosophical argument
because of that and and people tend to do that quite often i when i often think about richard
dawkins and his amazing work with the the selfish gene and then now that's complete nobody cares
because once he wrote the god delusion people have completely dismissed such brilliant ideas that came
before that and that's a quite a bad habit and i think dennett has fallen into the same trap because
his philosophical work he's science he's he's a cognitive scientist as well he's immersed himself
he was one of the first people to bring the sciences into this philosophical sphere um it reminds
me of patricia churchland and the way they did this neurophilosophy and they were these people who
brought this together for us and and we cannot take that for granted absolutely um i think that the uh
it's one thing i'm not talked much about when i talk about that it's about um the horseman thing um
um i think some things that i've heard dan say he he did that uh as a piece more of public service
than as something that he was deeply passionate about i mean yes i mean understanding religion
as an actual phenomenon is a very interesting task task for um uh cognitive science indeed psychology
cultural theory and so it's an interesting time it's a very interesting phenomenon um but i think he thought
that i i don't think he was as hostile to religion um or certainly to religious attitudes or instincts
as some of the others were i think he had a lot of sympathy for many of the attitudes that were
find expression in religion he said a beautiful thing on a podcast i can't remember which one it was
oh no i'm not an interview anyway he said um that there was many valuable things about religion that
we shouldn't we should take care not to lose when we lose the the the the dogmatic forms of
religion that are that are causing um that can cause so much harm and um one of them he said was the
idea that religion uh is like um a religious community is like a family it's a place where
when you go they have to take you in
religion and that unconditional acceptance and forgiveness and so on so in many ways he he valued
these the attic the the attitudes that find expression some of the attitudes that find expression
not for some more dogmatic um um ones um he valued some of the attitudes that find expression in religion
um but he also thought there's a lot of harm done by religion and the people were exploited and
persecuted and and um a lot of division caused by religion uh uh and of course he was thinking i
suppose from an american perspective where there was certainly uh i mean i won't go into this but
some forms of religion that seem quite exploitative so i think he thought of that as as a piece of
public service that he was doing um and which actually distracted him from the things that he really
wanted to be doing and it was i think it was also because the fact that these four guys had written
these books around the same period it just sort of clumped together as like a cult in in themselves
this new age atheist yes but but what you're talking about is very clear because it's it's true that
not like unlike the others who were not pro professional philosophers he had the ability to do that
and break away from it in a successful manner whereas the others had this almost anti-religious anger
towards it um and i think he was sort of different in that way yes yes yes yes i i i i i don't
i i mean look he definitely was anti-religion but i don't think it was to the extreme that
the others were absolutely i mean he was he was insistent that i i think one thing that i mean there's
that piece he wrote after he had his serious um um when he had the uh uh his 2006 and he had a
iotic dissection and um very nearly died he wrote a wonderful piece uh almost on i think he read it
from his hospital bed um um uh called uh thank goodness he asked people not to thank god for um uh
uh uh preserving him for for for for for saving him but to thank the goodness of the people who had
been involved in doing it and again i think this reflected his practical approach to um to life in
general there were lots of people to thank lots of people who had worked really hard um both the
people who had done the research behind the the techniques that were used and the people who had
actually been there implementing those techniques and they and the people who'd come and brought him
food and uh washed him and looked after him all of these people had played a huge practical role in
saving him and those are the people we should thank and in society those are the people we should thank
the people who keep things running and keep and who preserve us who preserve our our way of life
our happiness those are the people we should thank not some intangible um being who's who's only
in all this is totally mysterious and um so uh it was i think there was a sort of indignation at
people ignoring the true sources of goodness and the true sources of meaning in our life again it's
he wasn't wanting to take away the um it's another illustration what i was saying that he yes he said
don't don't think don't thank god don't think uh uh some of some uh abstract being from another realm of
existence but it wasn't saying don't thank anyone don't be don't don't have gratitude yes have lots
of gratitude but have it to the right targets so the emotion that people are expressing through oh
thank thank god that's fine but direct it to the right target and i so i think that's that's i guess
that's how he would have wanted to at least his attitude to the best in religion will be let's preserve
it but set it in a better framework yeah now it was more about breaking that spell similar to the
consciousness spell i mean let's let's let's head to that um while we're here one of his famous quotes
i think it was in my essay as well um dennett's quote was consciousness is an illusion of the brain
for the brain by the brain and i know in one of your papers you said um if i'm paraphrasing incorrectly
just let me know um you say that if consciousness if it's an illusion to think consciousness is an
illusion then you are not disillusioned has that held true since we last spoke yes yes and well i've
always in in with with the caveat that it's a certain conception of consciousness that we're talking
about i'm not saying that we're not conscious in any sense obviously yeah um we're not unconscious
we're not in a coma we're awake and we're perceiving things and we're aware of things
vividly aware of the world around us and of our own bodily condition and of course we are
yes i'm not suggesting promote the people that are ordinary talk of um seeing hearing feeling
smelling tasting being in pain having feeling pleasure and so on isn't doesn't capture anything
of course it doesn't capture one of the most essential things about it i'm just denying a certain
picture of what that is um which says that it involves immediate acquaintance with with mysterious
mental qualities that are somehow produced by the brain um now maybe key define it because it's not
you're not saying consciousness is an illusion you are saying a concept of your perception or thought
or idea of consciousness is actually the illusory issue i'm saying that there's something that happens
when we um attend to our own experience when we think about our own experience that induces us to
adopt a certain picture of what it is to be conscious that is deeply misleading and that there's
something about this when i say we attend to our own experience i could use the word intro spec when
we sort of look in with or we pay attention to how it is with us right now what it's like to be us if
you like to use a phrase um there's something about what happens then and what does happen then is a
very very interesting question for cognitive science that produces this if you like this or tends to
induce us to endorse this view of of ourselves and um the nature of our experience that i think is deeply
uh flawed and misleading and we could call an illusion because there is this deep um
tendency for us to to um uh to endorse this view it's not it's not that this view is one that
it may be that you don't endorse the view until it's presented to you by a philosopher perhaps it
perhaps has to be articulated but once it is articulated it gets a great grip on us
and uh i think there's something about the nature of our of introspection itself that
makes us susceptible to this picture even if we don't uh pre-theoretically articulate even if we
don't articulate it to ourselves until we get to do some philosophy science a little confused so the
picture is that there's a if you like an irreducibly what i call an irreducibly subjective
world there's a that that my being conscious involves that being that coming into existence
a world that is just for me
that it's it's that is somehow distinct from the world that we share
it was the shared world with all the things in it that we can all uh communicate about and point to
and identify and uh and agree on the features of but then there's this private world which is how
that outer world is as it was rendered and presented to me internally um what the outer world feels like
for me where me here is a bit unclear because it it's almost like there's an inner me that is it's not
just the the physical me but there's a sort of enemy aware of this inner world which is how the outer world
is uh is is is is is rendered for this enemy and so there's this irreducible subject subjective world
and no one can know what that world is like they can guess it from their similarity to me from the
things i say i the the organism from the my behavior from my attempts to describe it and so on they can
speculate about it and guess that it's probably like their own to a large extent um but they can
never actually detect it um there's no one neuroscientist or any form of cognitive scientist can can
uh examine this world can uh uh directly detect its its properties um and it's a mystery how the
physical brain produces it um some people may think it's it's not physical at all that it's a
that it's a an immaterial soul others think that it's something that the physical brain produces but
that is more than just the activity of the brain it's it's some creation of the brain and its relation
to what the brain is doing is very mysterious this is the hard problem how does the the physical public
brain the the objective brain produce this subjective world and now i think there's something right about
that picture the brain is doing something um that involves representing the world and creating a
perspective on it but it's not creating this radically separate realm of reality that's the illusion
it's the way we think about what the brain is actually doing which is again it's like the
dinette thing that we shouldn't think of something it's not wrong to talk about us as having a subjective
perspective on the world it's just wrong to conceptualize it in this um inflated way as a separate
realm of reality so we we need to remove ourselves remove that picture but then replace it with another
picture of subjectivity that is less metaphysically inflated and that is more tractable and that we
can begin to understand and theorize and gradually unpick uh using the tools of quantum science and
thereby integrate ourselves more with the shared world so that we're not separate from it but part of
it yes yes i mean it's uh when i listen to it i often think i i know exactly what you're trying to say
really just not listening to what you're saying you know they're not taking it similar to what we were
talking about with dennis pepper and calling qualia they're really dismissing it but not really
understanding exactly where you're trying to come at it and i think the first time we spoke for about
three hours and nobody really understood i think they should really go back and watch that because
we went into quite a lot of detail we spoke about the ethics the ethical implications how some of my work
um i also helped defend a little bit of it and and you they just there's so much backtracking i feel
your pain i don't even know what else to say except i feel your pain and because when i try to speak
about it with colleagues or if i try and have the conversation with other philosophers or professors
on this channel i see immediately the the misunderstanding and and it's difficult because i sometimes don't
want to to play devil devil's advocate too much and i also don't want to defend someone else's view too
much so i find myself just letting them have that misunderstanding because this podcast is not about
me having an argument or a debate with people it's to let them explore their ideas so that's what this
episode's about while while we're talking about these misunderstandings let's let's robert kuhn just
released that paper the the landscape consciousness i think it's a perfect time to talk about this because
this would be your way to sort of give us examples of where people's illusions are coming from or or
where their illusory opinions of their version of consciousness might be he broke it out into bonisms
idealisms panpsychisms he referenced you as well um at some point there's a lot many points where he
actually referenced you and cited your work anything you want to say about that paper first before we
begin i'm going to chat to robert in about two in about a month or so so fantastic um yeah to be
honest i've only skimmed it so far so i i i will need to i'm i'm going to read it again much more
carefully and i'm sorry i won't five thousand words keep it's kind it's 175 000 words it's crazy
but so um i i won't start digging into that because there's so much there and um uh
uh let me just say two things one thing i i think the i'm convinced of this that that um
whether or not the sort of view that i have you have and dan had is right uh it's a view that's worth
articulating and uh offering to people for their consideration and i think uh once people do
consider it uh carefully and comprehendingly i think they will find it attractive but there's a
bigger now this is what you were saying there's a big communication problem i think i've got the
picture um uh but as you see so just then i was struggling somewhat to articulate it yes okay and i
was qualifying it partly because i'm aware of the things that people will say so i'm trying to and
i'm trying to say something that is fairly bold and clear to put across the the the structure of the
view but at the same time being careful not to make trying not to make it too bold so that i overstep
and deny something that i don't want to deny it's more a matter of a reconceptualization of things so
it's not that's much a denial as saying again as i said before like free will or whatever it might be
it's it's not saying it doesn't exist it's saying it's not what you think it is but trying to get this
and it's a change of perspective and once you if i can get people into the right position to look at it
they will see for themselves what i'm trying to say you think that you think that maybe you should
have considered nicholas humphrey's a slight twist of the word i mean into phenomenal surrealism because
i think that might have been a good move now in hindsight i think that's i think that's i think
that's good um and i think it's useful part of the tech of the the technique um i i worry though that
um you wanted magicism eh or magicalism i originally did i because i like this idea that um again this
this quotation from lee seagal um a writer on magic that dan used so often with the distinction between
real magic and magic that is actually real the real magic being the magic that is that wizards and
people in stories do in fairy tales and magic that can actually be done the sort of magic that pen and teller
do and and so i would like to say that consciousness is magic not in the first sense but in the second
sense it's a very very clever trick and the point about these these these they both have the same
effects really they both create the same effects on us on the observer whether it was done by real
magic or done by pen and teller magic it still looks like there's some body floating in the essay okay
um and the power of nature of evolutionary processes to craft the stage magic type of magic and to uh
convince us that things are that there's real magic in the very fairy tale uh the way um occurring i think
we shouldn't underestimate the power of nature to craft those kind of uh of magical effect for its own
ends which is exactly what nick talks about in soul dust which is some subtitle is the magic of
consciousness so he he did initially like this this um this uh notion of magic and illusion um but
his worry and i i shared it i shared this way because his worry i think is that the effect the magical
effect what we the the the effect that we use phenomenal talk to describe is something very real
and it is it expresses something very important this is the thing for nick that when we talk about what
it's like we're we're expressing something very important we're expressing how things affect us their
significance for us how we react to them he talks about um it's not the perception of red but
not um but reading uh the sensation of red is a response to a certain kind of stimulus to red stimuli
it's our take on those things it's what uh it's the significance that red things have for us and i
completely agree with this it's something i'm trying to develop in my in my current work and so if you
like when we talk about what experience is like we're talking about how it impacts on us how it
affects us what the complex multi-dimensional significance that it has for us and we ex if
we um i was going to say we experience the experience but we we're aware of this if you like as a sort of
condensed essence of significance okay so we encounter the world as packed with significance because what
it's doing the the the shared world is bombarding us with stimuli we are reacting to those stimuli in
multiple different dimensions uh cognitive emotional physiological um all sorts of different dimensions
many of these reactions are not actually overt they're just sort of subtle changes in our expectations
in our tendencies priming us to respond to the next round of stimuli and i think we have a sense this
is what introspection gives us a sense of how that unfolding reaction this complex multi-dimensional
reaction of how it of how it is unfolding at each moment and that's what we're gesturing at when we
talk about what the experience is like we have a sense of the condensed significance of the stimulus for
us nothing here that's essentially private it's all due to mechanisms of of of sensitivity and reactivity
and monitoring of those mechanisms but it gives but it doesn't come to us in that way it comes to us as
a sense of this is what that stimulus means for me and that meaning that expressive um um that expression of
our response that's perfectly real okay so when this this this reading that is perfectly real that
response is real and this is why nick doesn't like to talk about illusion because he thinks the loot
that the stuff that i'm describing as the the talk the talk that i construed as referring let me say this
again that it think about the function that talk about what it's like about phenomenal consciousness
think about the function of the talk now he agrees with me i think that and with dan that the function
that talk isn't to track mysterious mental property qualities that are directly presented to us that
it will create illusion but he thinks it's doing it's tracking something else this um uh uh the um
expressive um the the significance of of stimuli for us it's expressing that significance it's like it
has an expressive function rather than a descriptive function it's it's saying what this means for me and
that is perfectly real because it does mean that for me and that's why um uh he doesn't like to talk
of as an illusion and i agree with him but in that sense it's not an illusion have you read sentience
i have yes yes and which which which which which applies this framework i need to reread which
applies this frame to the questions about the distribution of consciousness uh in the natural world
and suggests that um it's and there's an important distinction being cold-blooded and warm-blooded
um creatures yes full of wonderful ideas daniel uh dan's actually gave that book very high praise
yes that was the next closest where closest and the closest he's ever gotten to giving a perfect
definition of consciousness in his opinion yeah it's a wonderful book i'd strongly recommend it
that um i've i've i've said some i think i said some nice things about it as well um so but the
illusion talk isn't isn't addressed um to those people as it were to the people that nick's suggesting
ways it's addressed to the people who who want to take um i want to construe phenomenal um language in a
different way and build metaphysical um um edifices uh around the um uh the uh upon the basis of
phenomenal realism and i think those people are chasing an illusion okay and it's important to say
that quite sorry to uh it's a point to to be quite robust about that we have to get rid of the false
pictures so nick is focusing i think on building the positive picture um i'm focusing on the illusion
talk certainly is designed more to um get people to to drop the bad picture but i see them as
complementary for that reason i think okay so let's do this uh keith let's try and frame this a little
better so people understand there is the problem of course which we have to address but there's two
things i want to bring up one was you have you've been working on what's known as the reactivity
schema theory which i think we should definitely cover at some point um or unless you would like
to do that first and then like sort of build our way up uh whichever you want to do what's what's
what are you going to how are you going to continue that i think let's address the illusion problem oh
sorry the second thing that i wanted to ask you about was the last time we spoke of 2021 you said
you were going to write a book descartes prison do you remember is that something is that still
something in the in the making or it absolutely is but i've um title have you decided on a new i
know i think that's the sort of working title but it's something i was going to say to you um
in relation to this problem of getting people to see the view for what it is i've i've continued to write
more or less technical pieces for for journals and and um collections of papers about illusionism and
the reason i've held off trying to write the popular book is that i i want to build up a sufficient mass of
um techniques for presenting the view accessibly i don't think there's much point in writing a view
that presents it in a way that only other philosophers who were sympathetic to the position
or at least willing to take the time to unpick it uh would would appreciate i want to write it in a way
that really presents it accessibly and attractively to a wide audience yes i mean dan made a pretty good
job of you know doing this in consciousness explained i think but it's needs continually redoing and
i so i've held off thinking i want to get myself not just clear about the details of the position but
also clear about how best to present the position this is one reason why i like doing podcasts and why i like
chatting on twitter and so on is what i'm doing each time is trying out different ways of presenting it
and seeing which ones work um and i feel i'm building up a sort of uh um a portfolio of of ideas
which i can then use but i want to try i like to think that i can write fairly engagingly um and that's
what i want to do i don't want to just write a book for that other philosophers will read and we'll get
um yeah a few positive and a few negative reviews and then we'll go on to the shelves yes i want to
try to put this and so that's so yeah i'm descartes prison it's a little unfair to descartes actually
because there's ways of construing what descartes was doing in the meditations that that that that are
much more um uh that that that don't um that there's there's a tradition of using descartes in a
certain way i mean they talk of the cartesian theater and so on um which may be a little unfair to
um to what he was trying to do to him there's a matter of dispute exactly what he was trying to do
um but it may be that this use of him as a as a whipping boy is it where is is a it's a bit unfair
to the historical descartes but it's certainly there's only a uh a popular descartes yeah i thought
i thought you might have been playing a little bit um of a back and forth with your buddy um philip
because i know i mean obviously galileo's era is paying homage to yeah that was about yeah and well and
that's another thing that's happened since then you guys have mind chat do you think that's changed
anything regarding your views over time i'll put a link to the podcast as well oh it's it's it's
wonderful to to talk to the guests it's fun hey it's one of those it really does open your eyes to many
alternate ways of thinking uh i we've been trying to make them shorter and more um accessible but i kind
of like the early ones where we just rambled on for three i was talking to someone and it was it was
i enjoyed those we would just sit and talk to um whoever it might be david papan or whatever for
for three hours i'm chatting today i'm chatting to david next week oh fantastic yes he's always great to
talk to um and imperialist or physicalist as you can get that's uh he's sorry he's as materialist or
physicalist as you can get oh yes yes i mean he doesn't like the term illusionism but i whenever
i talk to him we seem to end up on a similar similar page so i think i suspect the differences
are more in presentation and anything you want anything you would like me to ask him keep clarify
for you uh i can't go on the top of my head but if i do i'll let you know um so yes the popular book
but i want to do it right that's the point i don't want to i don't want to to to to waste an
opportunity um to um to do that maybe i'm just putting it off but so i i thought oh i'll i'll for
instance i've just published a paper um on the ethical implications of illusionism in which i um
look at some some words that people have um particularly some some concerns raised by my fellow
illusionist francois camera um who is a committed illusionist but thinks that illusionism might
force some revisions to our ethical because i don't think they that it does in fact i think
that insofar as it does invite ethical um revisions they're entirely benign positive ones that involve
expanding our our um our circle of ethical concern um sorry i'm but i wanted to i wanted to get these
worked out in uh in detail for myself before i tried to put them and also to find the metaphors
i keep playing around with metaphors the rainbow is the one that i've been using um uh recently well
a little while now it's uh are rainbows illusions um well it depends what you mean by rainbow if you mean
a certain sort of atmospheric effect created by a low sun in a moisture-laden atmosphere
um uh the effect that it creates on a perceiver standing at a certain with her back to the sun
that said well that's perfectly real i mean you can take a photograph of it if you mean an actual
colored arc at a certain spatial location in the sky moving down to meet the ground at a certain
position no there's no such thing if you go there you won't find a rainbow um so i i kind of like
that it's that rainbows are real but they're not what you might naively think they are like
arcs in the heaven and so i i i i kind of like that one because it means that you can robustly say
you know consciousness is real like a rainbow is real but don't expect to find it in the brain in
the way that you would just any more than you expect to find a a rainbow at the particular um
location in the sky don't go outing for the pot of the pot of gold at the end of it is like
looking for the neural correlates you also they need to really define people also need to realize that
the word illusion needs to be defined correctly as wrong and they misunderstand that is yes of course
of course it's a provocative but of course a lot of people say what that illusion is itself a
conscious state that consciousness can't be an illusion goodness say yourself contradicting
yourself well of course um sure illusions are experiences but i treat them the illusionist
treats them like all other experiences a state that are not don't have themselves have phenomenal
properties so we can perfectly well explain how phenomenality could be illusion provided the
illusion itself is is not defined in in phenomenal terms so that's um that's a bit of a red herring but
i think any word i wanted to use magicism i mean surrealism too which nick uses which i do like
to take i'm sure i'm sure that i'm sure that has or michael's caricature caricature yes i mean all of
these are gesturing at the same idea that it's not what you think it is that it's in some way distorted
exaggerated um in a way that leads us to form certain it's um nick's view it would be like looking
at one of picasso's painting and expecting to find people with distorted faces and arms and things
it is i think franco i think franco will do a good job at also assisting you with building up that
database that will allow you to eventually write the book you want because he is very actively
involved with this and you gave me his email address and allowed us to have the chat i'll put a link
to that for everyone who's watching franco it's great he's doing this sort of david charmers of
illusionism i like thinking that he's he's he's doing this this careful taxonomy of positions
and options which david is so good at um uh i guess i'm more more i'm not uninterested i certainly am
and i always enjoy reading franco's work to see how he's um um analyzing the logical space if you like
um or mapping mapping the logic when you guys did the illusionism as a theory of consciousness
um theory of consciousness your paper the one that you had edited and got put together i didn't realize
how young franco was at the time it was actually he just finished his um his his phd but he's he's
a fantastic philosopher um and we wrote a paper together last year on um in fact doing this very
thing uh um taxonomizing logical possibilities of foreign introspective systems um and franco himself
is working on a book on illusionism which i which which which will i think be a really important
contribution to um to the to um it's it again to to exploring the the the landscape of possibilities
here which is much richer i think than some people think much much richer and of course he has his own
particular um uh path through that landscape but um i it's been relatively underexposed and the way in
which people have been exploring say panpsychism over the past few years um it's good to see this
being done for the alternative position um uh so again how fancy that's why i just recruit more and
more people to the cause i think yeah he does he he is sort of doing a a very valid taxonomy i mean
giving you these oh absolutely and more than that it's also arguing for a position within it is um
yes exactly it's fantastic it's great to have him on board he's one um it's you know it's fantastic i
heath what's up heading would you put for the book decards prison where what would you have
oh do they have to have some things yeah yeah i don't know let me think but i might not even go with
that but um um something catch here somebody um uh well it's i wonder i wonder i want to get a lot
people to escape from this um from this prison so since um no i don't know escaping the illusion of
phenomenal consciousness or something like that maybe um a lot of people it's surprising how many
people how you find who are interested in philosophy and on social media sites like
on twitter and reddit and so on are absolutely convinced of uh that all they are directly acquainted
with is their own mental states they're they're even if they're um even if they're realists seem if
they think that they're still indirect realists even if they're not idealists they think that
we're all locked into a private all locked into private mental worlds um and they they cannot see
some of them how they could be any other way of taking this um so they're locked into what is uh
may not be idealist but it's got strongly idealist tendencies to think that they they um that um
at best we can infer the presence of a non-mental world it seems to me such a uh uh the viewers never
remotely appealed to me and it seems such a strange and anthropocentric i suppose view of of of uh of the
world which centers are i mean one way of trying to unpack this is to imagine um i suppose building a
an artificial creature that is gradually acquires more and more perceptual capacitism uh and abilities
to monitor its own perceptual capacitism to talk about them and to monitor its own reactions to
perception to talk about those and to uh and to and in fact this is something i'm trying to do and to
trace uh the the the progress to the point where it's convinced itself that it is that is only aware
of its own mental states i think there's a certain um uh animals i take it and non-human animals just
just live in the world there's just the world there and of which they are part and their bodies are part
and they live in that world and that is immediate to them and they never for the moment think that
they are just living in the world of their own experience um uh now like what do you need to add to that
sort of animal um experience what sort of self-monitoring systems do you need to add self-monitoring
processes do you need to add to get to the point um where you start to think of it think of your
think of your experience that way um as merely a a screen a screen between you and the world
you touched on you touched on idealist views now at this point franco and i when we were chatting he
asked me about my view and how it's changed over time and i'm pretty sure you're curious as to it as
well since yeah but i i told him that i still have very much intuition illusionist intuitions but my
openness to discussing these concepts with other people has really grown since then and and while
prior to starting the podcast i would take idealism completely i would i would not even consider it to
put it on the table to discuss but now i find some of them very fascinating very intriguing
some panpsychist theories are very intriguing so the more so what he said that i'm doing is is
i'm creating these wonderful pockets and virtual realities and then going into it with these people
having a great discussion and coming out which is very good because it does allow me to to not make
it feel like a debate for them and not um make it feel like i'm i'm there to bring down their view
but rather to explore it but when i think about it now what has happened to my own view is
i still very much have these illusionist tendencies and intuitions but i've become more and more
mysterious at this point i really don't know what consciousness is and nor do i think we'll be able
to find the solution to the mind-body problem oh uh interesting uh first i think you're absolutely
right to enter into um into the um to the world of the person you're talking to otherwise you don't
appreciate that perspective you need to enter into it this is what i was begging asking for people to
do the illusions i'm trying i'm going to try and do that for you today we need to do the same thing
with um that people disagree with in order to uh appreciate uh in order to be fair to them in order to
um speak we have to inhabit their point of view to real to understand it's it's it's it's power you
can't evaluate a point of view from an external point of view um you need to inhabit it for a
while see what it feels like try it on see if this if this suit of clothes works for you or you know
in my metaphor climb up that hill and have a look from there and see how things look and if you don't
like the view or the thing doesn't fit well fine okay but that's the only way you're going to really
appreciate it's it's it's attractions and there may be stuff you can bring back from that uh the
insights from that you can bring back and incorporate into your own perspective i'm mixing my metaphors
horribly um so yes i think that's absolutely the way to do it um uh in fact if you if you don't do
that then i think really you're not doing philosophy you're just rather dogmatically defending um the
set position that that you've you've decided to um uh to pin your colors to um no but are you
i'm not i'm not even sure to be honest i just have no i'm so ontologically agnostic at this point
that that i just don't know it's become blurry let's say i suppose my attitude is
i then it has a nice example that the uh what is it that they i think a bowl of yeast has about the
same number of cells as as a human brain and the cells themselves have individually considered in
isolation have much the same uh complexity similar of internal structure um and metaphysically
i guess a little bit on the part of the difference is in how the cells in the brain are connected up
um the complexity of what they're doing um and so i i think the the default metaphysical position
simply that we don't need a new metaphysics for what the brain is doing um the metaphysics that
will work for what i don't know the liver or the digestive system or the cells in a bowl of yeast are
doing let's assume that that works for the brain too which is just a bunch of similar cells connected
up in a very very special way that is the product of billions of years of evolution and
of thousands of years of cultural um evolution too so let's just let's take that as our default
position and see if we can't explain everything within that now if in the end we can't if there's
some things we can't explain fine but then we might need to expand our our ontology let's just try
it first that should be the the default approach i think and the fact that um you can sit in your
armchair and say well i can't see how how we could how we could account for the manifest features of
consciousness um in that way uh well you can't that's that's an intuition you have that's you're
predisposed to think that okay fine that doesn't really establish anything except that you have this
sense that there's something mysterious and it may be that we can explain why you think there's something
mysterious in fact why you have an unshakable something i have an unshakable conviction that
there's something mysterious and that it seems that this mysterious thing is the thing they know
better than anything else in the whole world maybe we can explain that and if we can then you have a
situation where we're saying well okay i have this unshakable conviction that i'm directly and
immediately presented with something that can't be explained in in physical terms but we've explained
exactly why i have that conviction i know exactly i have that conviction and it's not
because the explanation doesn't actually mention anything that can't be explained in physical terms
it's all um couched in the terms of cognitive science so it completely explained that that sense i
have with without assuming it's true but i'm going to trust it anyway um that would be like someone who
says look i saw a ufo last night and uh somewhere kind of uh investigates and says well actually it
was due to this like a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere or some atmospheric effect or
whatever and they explain exactly why it looked as if there was a ufo at that place there and the
person says well yeah i grant you that all those things you mentioned those um those non-ufo things
were present and that they would have looked like a ufo but there was still a ufo there maybe it was hiding
behind all of that i'm just going to trust my intuition anyway well you can do that but it's
but our intuitions are not the best source of information and perhaps particularly when we're
thinking about ourselves why should our intuitions about our own minds be wonderfully reliable we'd
expect them to be useful perhaps maybe unless they're just side effects um if they're adaptations
then we'd expect them to be useful but a lot of um useful um um attitudes are not strictly true um and
it might just be a side effect of other processes so i think yeah to look to give you an example of
where the mysterious aspects start to come in for me at least is when you see people's work like let's
say michael levin and how his work can sort of build up into a panpsychist view and and his work
is so compelling and so amazing that you can't help but give a lot more credence to the philosophical
view afterwards there he i don't necessarily believe he does consider himself a panpsychist
his thought process and the science behind it does and eventually lead to that um and then on the other
side you've got someone like donald hoffman with the physics behind it and then you try and
you sort of ask yourself if we don't understand the nature of reality can we really make plausible
arguments for certain natural phenomenon and then i get stuck in that dilemma but well there certainly
might be a case for expanding a mentalistic vocabulary quite widely and dan thought this he
thought that the intentional sounds can be usefully applied at all sorts of levels including at the
levels of molecular biology so maybe that intentional idioms can be usefully applied quite widely
um yes also graphs theory also assists with that uh so who's hands multiple drafts theory also yes
yes yes yes yes um so maybe that that certain aspects of mentalistic uh um mentalistic concepts
can be but i don't see how i don't see how panpsychism doesn't have any explanatory power at all
um this is the thing that philip could insisting it doesn't it doesn't contradict or needn't at
least contradict anything in um uh in um uh in physics or in molecular biology or neuroscience or
anything like that any uh the third person physical um science it's simply providing an account of the
intrinsic nature of all the things mentioned in those accounts where that intrinsic nature itself
doesn't make any difference to anything and so all it's accounting for is our intuition this intuition
that there's something intrinsic that's not accounted for by by by by the third person story um now it
seems to me that scientists as such have no need of that hypothesis it's not it's not doing any work
it's a fifth wheel um so i'd be skeptical about uh about that and the thing that strikes me about about
about don's work is of course that he's he's stresses how much perception is uh distorting and caricatured and
so on for um um adaptive purposes but it seems that introspection is completely uh uh immediate and
reliable and we and consciousness is our unconsciousness is known to us in a in a in a in such an immediate way
that we can even we we even justified in taking it as the foundation of all reality that our insight
into our own our our insight into the our awareness of the world around us is deeply deeply distorting
but our awareness of our own minds is so perfect that is actually a window onto fundamental reality
of the world i i don't think that's taking evolution seriously i don't think it's taking the
idea that introspection itself is an evolution with that with don at least i i appreciate the fact that
don admits that so don will yes he does he will bring he will say that reality fundamentally we
have zero insight as to what reality really is but here i am making a leap because i have to make some
sort of a prediction in order to sort of prove this so so at least he does that which is i mean if he
wanted to say that reality is utterly utterly unknown to us then i would okay maybe but what i i i i
i i there's this idea look there's a sort of hole at the at the fundamental at the fundamental level
and so what should we put in it well we need something um something that's not derived from
the higher levels and so what is there well there's an insight into our nature of our own consciousness
well i just i suppose it fits the bill in the sense that it it does seem anomalous in some way it doesn't
seem to be easily explained in terms of these higher levels so it does seem as if it's something extra
and the sort of thing that might be fundamental and so might therefore be capable of being plugged
into this gap but i just think the idea that that just massively over um estimates our epistemic powers as
evolved creatures why should i i like to imagine that there's some uh this alien species that have
um they've never evolved our sort of consciousness they're they're they're they're let's say they've
evolved as illusionists okay so they think of themselves as conflict pieces of biological um
complex biological organisms that have a certain awareness of their own mental operations which um
may be simplified and so on but they never never tempts them to think that there's anything
non-physical about their own minds they don't think there's a hard problem they just think that
they can be completely explained by cognitive science they're quite happy with this but they
have noticed this other gap at the fundamental level that there seems to be a something that we
don't have an account of what the fundamental nature of reality is now it doesn't occur to them to think
that their own minds supply them with any evidence of this because i think their own minds are
completely explicable but then they come and visit us and they notice that we seem to be um
aware of something in our own minds they're going to come to visit us and this tiny little planet on
this you know this sort of remote um uh you know douglas adams location on the outer unfashionable outer
reaches of the spiral and they say oh look these creatures have found the answer to the problem of
what the fundamentalization is something in their minds i mean it just seems too parochial too contingent
too self-aggrandizing to think that i sitting in my armchair reflecting on my own mental capacities
can see into the fundamental nature of reality i i don't know that it's somehow my weightings in my
bayesian network just won't allow me to go that way at all and i honestly find it quite difficult to
think what the weightings would have to be like for me to go that way i'm looking at this this
landscape of consciousness i mean this will just sort of reiterate why i'm becoming so much more
more mysterious i mean look at this so there's we should talk more often
there's i mean there are materialist views quantum views integrated information panpsychisms monisms
dualisms idealisms anomalous and altered states challenges non-reductive physical
physicalisms um illusionisms of course as part of the materialist ones there's just so many different
theories right now this we're just looking at this when if yes but now divide those don't divide those
into ones that take phenomenal realism seriously i want essentially ones that that trust the zombic hunch
divide those into ones that trust the zombic hunch and ones that don't and you'll find that
i predict something like i probably i don't know 90 of them do maybe made that so but so a lot of them
do and a lot of that variety comes in trying to spell out ways of what happened paths you can go down
once you trust the zombic hunch and there are many but if the zombic hunch isn't reliable the explosion
of this proliferation of ways you can go is really it's testament to human ingenuity
um but as dan would say it's they're all just variants of chess that no one really played that
reality doesn't play they're all just uh if you assume if you were if you were you know dan has this
idea of chmes which is a game where just like chess except the king can move two squares at any one time
okay now you can study the theory of that of chmes and it will be as elaborate and complex as that
diagram shows but it's not the game that we play and maybe phenomenal realism isn't that isn't the
game that reality plays and if it's not exploring all these wonderful um uh um very brilliantly
articulated options um i isn't getting us anywhere it's also quite a it's quite a wonderful time to be
alive with ha with with consciousness being such a a vibrant topic at this point it's it's it's pretty
cool to see this happening which is the premise of this podcast and your podcast which is quite cool
i think yes i i certainly is exciting and because we are thinking about the um uh yeah i was going to
say something like the the the the essence being the heart of our existence and in a way i i think that
too because i do think that what we're talking about when we talk about consciousness about
how things feel is how things matter to us this is the reactivity thing maybe which we come back to
it's our talk about what experience is like is is an attempt to express the significance the
it to capture the essence of uh um an essence of significance if you like
um in our which we can't articulate but which is somehow um um uh we have a sense of the shape
the overall shape this is what i think this is this is why i get to talk about schemas and so on i think
that um uh we have uh introspective processes that model the overall shape of um our responses our
internal responses to stimuli and that capture in a few crude dimensions their um uh their overall
um outline and when we ask ourselves when we reflect on our own experience this we have a sort
of we have a we have an inarticulate sense of the shape of our current reactive state
and it seems to us it seems to us uh inexpressible we have a it's it's it's a it's a we can compare
the shape of this reactive um uh pattern with other reactive patterns we can say it's a bit like that
one it's not like that one and we can say something about its valence whether we like it or don't like
it we can talk about how um other occasions when we've when we've when we've been in states like
this we can suggest to other people that they might try to cultivate states like this or avoid them or
whatever um but we can't we don't see any of the the the detail and so it seems inexpressible it seems
well it is inexpressible um uh in certain ways uh and it seems to us um and so it is very very
important to us it's how the world is affecting us and there's hardly anything more important to
us individually than that um but uh so i forgot where i was going on this i'm sorry um i was trying
to give you there as uh slowly i think you were slowly going to take us into reactivity i was going
to but i realized that i was trying to take you too far into it without um without really setting the
ground up so um uh so much for my attempts to convey this um uh uh uh accessibly look it's
conscious it's complicated do you want to do you want to take me back to the beginning of the
reactivity thing and let me try and do it do it better let's actually frame out this reactivity
schema theory favor yes let's see some new content that i think people would want to know about
yeah excellent well look i've got a quote here let me introduce this with a quote from
from dennett again then it's always in my mind particularly my minor um it's my paper in 1923 i
think um in which he was uh i think it's uh his response to contribution to a symposium on consciousness
explained and he says this he's talking about um the uh effects that stimuli have on us
um and he says this what anchors our naive sense that there are such properties as qualia
by the multiple asymmetrical interdependent set of reactive dispositions
by which we acquaint ourselves with the sensible world so his stimuli impact on our sense organs
and they produce a lot of effects on us and it's these effects these multiple
asymmetrical interdependent set of reactive dispositions associated with each stimulus
that he says roots is the root of our sense that we have uh qualia that which will be the solution to
the to the illusion problem our sense that the color red has as it were an identity a personality
all of its own is due to the host of different associations that go with each color so he's not
so he notice how there's a complete inversion here it's not that that there is an object there
the the feeling of red the quality of red that we are reacting to it's that there's simply the external
stimulus that we're reacting to and it's our awareness of this complex of reactions that gives
us the sense that there's something in us
that that has that richness of of of the um that that the the feel of red if you like it's not
something here that we're reacting to it's our sense of how we're reacting
yes there's a process that's occurring between that and and and then your actual response to
the stimulus the the idea is that there isn't anything occurring in between that it's our
awareness of the downstream effects of perception so it's not that the the the the when we talk about
the feel of the experience we're not talking about something that causes the downstream effects
we're talking about the downstream effects themselves let me go let me read a little bit more
before you continue i remember even a part of one of your papers in the past where you mentioned
that the actual neurons firing in themselves is exactly the the it's technically is the feeling
is that is what's occurring yes but not not just the the the the neurons otherwise what the neurons
are doing when they're fine and but not just the ones on the perceptual side there's a this is the
thing that that then continually um uh presses we tend to talk about what's the conditions that are
necessary for us for for a bit of information a bit of perceptual content to enter consciousness
of what how so the there's some uh stim stimulus and it's processed by
visual a certain wavelength of light impacting on the uh on the retina and that triggers all sorts of
perceptual processes and then we think of this as building up and building up and the more more
processing more more integration of different features that have been detected and so on and
somebody enters consciousness and as dan puts it many things of consciousness just stop there they say
what's that so if you enter consciousness right well but then as dan puts it what happens next what's
what's the upshot of this entering consciousness if nothing happens then there was no point in
it entering consciousness in fact if if there's no downstream effect of it entering consciousness
then it might as well not have entered consciousness because if it doesn't affect how you react in any
way then what was the point of it i mean it's just like some epiphenomenon i suppose now his thought
is when you start tracing out what happens after that all the effects that the stimulus has the downstream
effects that's where all the action is because even if the thing had definitively entered the bit of
the content had definitively entered consciousness it was it would still have to have all those down
downstream effects for it to mean anything could have any psychological significance
so the real impact of the stimulus the real sense that it matters to me is due to those downstream
effects so you can just cut out the bit about it entering consciousness that's not doing anything
even if it did it would still have to be processed downstream for it to matter to me that's where the actual
um clout of conscious experience is so forget about that so where does consciousness come in well
consciousness is our sense of all those downstream effects of what the stimulus is doing how it's uh
i like to say i like i got loads of metaphors i keep trying them out like um it's like the vibration
that occurs in in a bell when you strike it a certain complex pattern of or the pattern of ripples that
happen when you throw some sand into a wall into a pool of what still pool of water that's the
consciousness all the effects let me just read a bit more supposing that there is something in
addition to these complex families of reactive dispositions is falling for wait for it an illusion
plain and simple an illusion of subtraction you might call it um dan's commenting on something
sydney shoemaker uh had had written about his work so he mentioned shoemaker shoemaker seems to go along
with the natural but treacherous assumption that reactive dispositions must involve the person reacting
to a quality presented somehow to the reactor and causing by its presentation the reaction the given is then
taken for instance here's how pain works the pain networks produce somewhere central the awfulness
quality which is then the very property to which one again one who who's reacting here
reacts with abundance my view and this is the this is the the copernican shift my view is that this
confuses cause and effect that was my word copernican my view is that this confuses cause and effect it
is the reactions that compose the introspectable property and it is through reacting that one
identifies or recognizes the property now i think if you dwell on that sufficiently and um trace out
its consequences fully then i think you've pretty much got an answer to what i call the illusion problem
and you've got a theory of consciousness that is at least a good placeholder until we get uh until
we get empirical work that um that really maps out the territory properly for us i see now reactivity
schema theory at first i thought you were going to refer to your attention schema theory and it's it's
it's it's a it's a um it the name which i may not stick with actually if some people advise me not
do the name is modeled on that the idea what michael graziano has attention schema theory proposes
attention schema theory and the idea is that um uh the brain needs to control its own attentional
processes attentional processes are complex how do you control them well you need to have a model
to control something you need to have a model of it so the brain creates a model of its own monitors
its own attentional processes and creates a model of them but the model doesn't need to represent
all the detail in fact it would not be very useful for control purposes if it if it did so the brain
creates a schematic simplified model of attention i can't remember exactly how um that's gonna
characterize it but it's it models it almost like a an energy that flows out of the eyes and attaches
to things and tracks them and that itself can magically capture information and uh produce uh effects
um uh on on the rest of the uh the mind models in that simplified way that's enough for control
purposes and for tracking other people's attention as well in fact he started the interest was more
in tracking other people's attention i think yeah and it's very cool the way he he has some of that
work where if someone's looking at you or if you show someone a diagram of them looking at a tree
they'll think the tree is tilting away from the person because they feel there's a sort of potency in
the in the in in in in attention itself that it's like an energy in itself yes exactly that's his
idea is that's how the brain models attention for its own control purposes and then when we try to
introspect and ask ourselves about our attention what essentially what we do is we we tap information
from that model and we don't we don't have it all it doesn't come to us like oh this is the model that
my brain has constructed of attention we just get this sense that attention is something like
an energy that flows out of our eyes that's that we have these intuitions that attention works in
this kind of way and then when we try to reflect on this we elaborate this into a a a theory of the
mind as as as as a something that's separate from the physical person in the brain that we would
elaborate it into a dualistic theory of the mind as a as a as an immaterial thing that can that can
uh catch on to things in the world and get information about them and have uh uh uh magical
effects on the rest of of of of the physical brain so it's this model this simplified model
that then when we um um that when we drawn information for that model and try to reflect
on the nature of our own minds it induces us to adopt a dualistic uh perspective now my idea was to
extend this a bit i don't i i i don't i don't think anything that i want to say contradicts
what grazia says but it's more of an extension of it i think um and the idea is something like this
that that it's also useful for the brain to have a model of how it's being affected by current
stimulation uh if you think that any stimulus is going to have all sorts of um well if you like
affordances it's going to suggest all kinds of actions we could take approaching retreating um might
be um treating as a source of food um as a potential mate or something or whatever um there's many
different dimensions uh of possible action uh along which each stimulus can be uh assessed and the idea
is the brain is continually doing this it's not just it's not just observing the world just you
know for the fun of it like an s feet and it's it's it's searching for significance in everything
around us and this significance is going to be uh if you like included in the pattern of reaction
reactive dispositions that are being strengthened or triggered so the brain is going to be priming
itself for action even if it's not actually initiating action it's going to be a certain readiness
potentials whatever are going to be going up and so on and expectations are going to be changing
and if you could you could think of if you think of them the map of the reactive potential as it were
of the brain it's going to be continually changing on all sorts of dimensions one basic dimension
like valence is this is this is this a good situation or a bad situation for me that might be
the dominant one do i like this do i want this to continue or do i not like it i want it to stop but
there could be that could be broken down into many sub dimensions okay so you think about this
overall map of reactivity that is like a multi-dimensional shape that is continually evolving
a stimulation comes in now for most animals there's no need to model that uh you know you just
you just go with the the first order reactions as it were you just live in the world but suppose
you're a say a social animal or an animal that is capable of certain sorts of higher order um
uh higher um reflective thinking then it would be useful to have information about this because
for instance one thing if you're if you're a social animal you can communicate this to other
people you can say that stimulus um that that thing is this is it's not good don't you know it's
kind of i don't know that um berry tastes very bitter don't don't don't don't don't try it it has
this effect on me i can if i can be aware of the effect and encapsulated in some way in in speech
then i can usefully convey to other people what sort of effect it would have on them if they were
to try it without their having to actually try it animals can't do that i mean non-human animals
well that's simplifying but a lot of them can't do that a dog can't really convey to another dog
that it shouldn't try that food that made it sick the dog the other dog might see the dog being sick
and decide you know it's not gonna but the first dog can't just say don't eat that it's horrible
you can't do that um we can because we can have a sense of how the thing affected us
and we can encapsulate that in crude linguistic terms we can also use this information about how
things affect us about um sort of reactivity profile of different stimuli to uh uh plan courses
of action we can say well that was really nice i like that i'll try i'll make that recipe again or
something you know i will i will avoid i'll make sure to avoid doing that again again and non-human
animals can certainly learn by you know reinforcement learning and so not to do things again but they
can't reflectively plan and think i really like that thing i will actually make a strategy forget
you know for seeking it out they can as it were hack their own reactivity um uh patterns so it'd be
really useful i think and i think the social use is key be really useful for the brain to be able to
model this reactivity in some again schematic way not in all of the massively complex you know 86
billion years but in a schematic way that gives a sense of what the stimulus means for you its significance
now then again when we ask ourselves when we reflect on our current condition what it's like to be us
right now we tap information from this model and again it doesn't come to us in a in a detail form
it just it's just an intuitive sense of positive negative attract you know a different you know
frightening comforting um sweet um beautiful ugly whatever different dimensions of of assessment it just
comes to us as an intuition of significance a sort of essence of significance uh which we can we have
words for but we can't seem to pin down because it's not articulated in a detailed enough way and this
this essence of significance is what we're gesturing at with our talk about what it's like
but it is in fact uh simply uh there's what we all we have here are judgments based on a schematic model of
the reactivity patterns created by stimuli and that's an outline the the solution to the illusion
problem and it's based entirely on this suggestion from them from dennis i think it's quite cool that
he's right there by your shoulder because you obviously stood on the shoulder of a giant while
prepping absolutely it's very nice it's a very nice touch keith i wanted to tell you there was when i
spoke to um karl friston um i actually eventually got him to say that i'm the the bayesian bay the
bayesian brain approach um active inference and then free energy principle could sort of lead you to an
illusionist theory of consciousness and eventually agreed because i don't think i don't know i'm not
sure if you remember but in my paper i spoke about how if you use this sort of inference and active
inference and if people sort of get these prior informations that tells them that they have this
ineffable qualitative experience that is essence like they're more likely to then have a posterior
decision make decision that is i am conscious i am physically conscious and if you give them less
like a psychotic patient who's having this almost unrealistic derealization from reality they're not
conscious and and then he sort of agreed he said yes if you do take it to that if you do frame the
argument that way it will lead to an illusionist theory of consciousness i just thought i'd share that with
you and i think that's pretty much the perspective that andy clark has developed uh develops on on
this um uh there's a paper in the um collection of essays on a couple of the the the there's a
collection of essays um uh on the work of of dennett again the paper in there by andy clark which
really applies predictive processing um theory i think in along the general lines you're suggesting
um so yeah i think i think this is i should yeah i should have actually gotten that paper published
i just got so lazy afterwards and i forgot to do it um so yeah probably should because people ask me
all the time where is this paper i should probably make it available yeah i think i probably will
go to some of the questions from the audience or oh yeah sure yes i see someone else when was fire
invented um yes i also i saw that one do you have an answer to that question i don't know if you
well i i imagine fire itself has been around for a very very long time i suppose he means the human
um um fire ability to um to to manipulate fire
i just think that was just playing good question actually because i played a very uh nick humphrey has a
wonderful suggestion about um the role of uh the uh fire as a center of community
for early human societies coming around the fire and telling stories and the role of this in early
human society and its importance and he actually suggests that maybe one of the reasons humans lost
their body hair was precisely so that they needed to congregate around the fire and thereby cultivate
this importance means of social um exchange and interaction and creativity so um uh it's an important
question it is i think this person was making a joke but unfortunately you gave a very good answer
all jokes have a most of them i've got one here from tom clark it says this was two days ago perhaps
note that qualia is now frighted with anti-physicalist and anti-naturalist connotations in a way that
speaking of sensory qualities like the feeling of pain or taste of is not why deny that there are
qualities present in experience well look i'm trying to sketch a oh first of all because a lot of it's
it's freighted with a lot of all that stuff and i want to get rid of that um now i'll then go on and
tell you some positive story which i sort of tried to do in a somewhat impossible somewhat garbled way
there about um what is actually happening and about modeling of reactivity and so on okay and the
reactivity is what i would be inclined to call conscious i don't think by the way you need to
do this modeling in order to count as being a conscious being i'm quite happy to say that creatures
that don't do the modeling whose brains don't do the modeling are still conscious because they're still
actively engaged with the world they're still resonating with the world this pattern of ripples
that as i talked about is still occurring within them and that's what um that's what i think that's
what we should use the word consciousness for if we're going to creature consciousness if you if
you like as opposed to um unconsciousness so look i i will get that will then go on i will say
carly in that sense of illusion and i'll explain what picture i put in its place and i won't use the
word carlier in that now if you want to say someone wants to say look i like that picture i think it's
great good and i want to pin the word quality on that feature of it well you know knock yourself out i mean
call it what you want um uh i just don't want you to bring any of the baggage that that word used
to use and i think the neatest way here is just to use a new word so that it's quite clear it's like
someone saying look uh you know phlogiston theory yeah phlogiston there's a lot of that wrong with it
now this oxygen stuff this sounds really quite promising but i want to call it oxygen phlogiston well
go on if you want you'll confuse people and you might end up confusing yourself if you're not careful but
you know if you really want to go for it um the word doesn't matter the question is what work was
that word doing that i've that my story isn't doing now if you can point to some work that needs to be
done and that my story isn't doing great i'll listen if what it's doing is the kind of stuff that the
word quietly was mostly doing which is pointing to something that prose is a hard problem and that is
conceptually uh uh completely independent of of the vocabulary of cognitive science and so on and
you know you just yeah well i don't want to do that work so i don't think that word needs doing
yeah and here's another one actually keith doesn't call consciousness an illusion just phenomenality
but an interesting question of what picks out conscious states from a first person standpoint if
there's nothing qualitative about them right well look you can recognize you can you can recognize
when you're seeing stuff you know um uh you can tell you you uh if you're having if let's compare it
with unconscious perception you don't know that you're when you're if you're unconsciously adjusting
your position say because of a of a of a of a long-standing um let's say a back problem and you're
unconsciously adjusting your position you might say that that you explain that by an unconscious
perception of discomfort or something but if you're not aware if somebody says are you aware of
discomfort you say no no they say well you seem to be sitting in a funny way you must be well okay
maybe there's some unconscious perception of discomfort and that affected your behavior but
you weren't aware of it so you so it's being able to uh uh it's figuring it it look again dan's
uh cerebral celebrity it having enough effects of the kind we typically associate with consciousness
the kind we take to be look think about what would it take to be the signs of consciousness what are
the symptoms of being conscious or one of them is being able to report it so if you're doing experiments
say was the subject conscious of that very faint light well one way to do it is to say um you know
to ask them say when you're conscious of the light it reminds me a lot of music blackmore's work
of who susan blackmore reminds me yes absolutely absolutely another way is to use non-verbal measures
to say for instance whether there's you know they look at eye movement and so on use all these measures
they could they're probably not always going to deliver the same results but if a signal if you're
getting a positive score on a significant number of them it's conscious and the same goes how do you
know you're conscious because it's having enough effects on you for you to be able to talk about it
um do you notice this do you notice that you're in the state simply do you recognize the state
um i often feel like it also comes down to language a very big part of this is the fact that we have
these internal thought monologues that occur in a specific language and we've given these terms to
these things and and i think that's a big factor we often don't consider and the effect that that
internal monologue has on what comes to our attention this is the thing about the multiple
drafts when you start questioning yourself did i see that did i not see that um uh that
pulls up bits of information triggers them boosts them into into into popularity suddenly and so as
soon as you start attending to some internal sensation it blows up it becomes much more significant much
more significant it was its effects become greater um and um the great trick to living with mosquito
bites is to try and distract your attention from them um as soon as you attend to them they become
unbearable um distract your attention from them they go away and they they vanish uh we're continually
attending to stuff that's happening in our minds some of us more than others perhaps and
perhaps people of a of anxious disposition like myself over attending to things that are going
on in us and with that by boosting their uh their significance and this and there's there's a sort
of i think there's this is something that susan talks about yes susan blackmore talks about that
the way that it's a fridge light phenomenon when you when you when you open the fridge the lights on
again when you probe yourself there's always stuff to be found and the more you probe the more there is
and it can seem like there's an it sort of endless richness there because the more you probe the more you
you find but it's better it's better to say i think perhaps the more you probe the more you create
the more you stimulate the more reactions you provoke and therefore the more awareness of those reactions
there is um i i i'll tell once again my fate my my fate well my favorite this is one of them
one of the examples i'm working uh that i like to use that might come into the book eventually you go
to the fridge and you're looking for something that i probably mentioned this three years ago you're
looking in the fridge and you'll say you're looking for the pickles the jar of pickles and you open the
door and you look and you don't see it there's just no pickles okay and you call to your partner where
are the pickles you said we had some and your partner says they're in the fridge on the middle
shelf just look and you open the door again and bang they're there right where you'd been looking before
now it's very tempting to think what what was my experience like the first time if i could rewind the
inner tape of my experience and examine it again when i first looked in the fridge what would have
been at that location well we know what would have been at that location in the fridge namely the pickles
but what was at that location in my experience of the fridge was there a hole there was there the pickle
jar there but somehow it was in my experience but i didn't experience it that doesn't make sense was
there something else that did my brain make up some other object there now the point is there is no
answer to that question because this that the the the light bouncing off the pickle jar didn't produce
any reactions there was neither something there nor a hole there nor anything there there was just
you didn't simply missed it it simply didn't figure in your consciousness in one way or another
there's no reactions this is where that bayesian sort of framework might might come into assist as well
you've been now you've been given the priors merely by your wife saying that it's in the fridge you
now go in looking for something very different you know where you know where to attend that spot yes
exactly um exactly that's that that's that's why the experience is transformed the second time
but if you think that there are determinate contents of consciousness then you have to answer the question
what were the determinate contents of my consciousness at that particular location at the moment of the
first time i looked and there is no answer to that that is remotely plausible neither a pickle jar nor a
kind of black hole nor any other sort of hole nor any other sort of product why would the brain create
and the problem there's no answer to that this is like change blindness experiments yes and remotely
the answer is the answer is there was no determinate stream of consciousness for that to be a question about
yes it was simply the fridge and you and your reactions to the fridge and we often forget
about this poor predictive processing power in our brains the limited resources we're using
absolutely just it's we're just continuously confabulating lying to ourselves it's we're not perfect
absolutely and again this is something that that um don hoffman for example emphasizes so much with
regard to perception that simply doesn't extend to our awareness of ourselves now if you take seriously
the idea that we are part of this same world as as the world where our perceptual systems are monitoring
that we're just another part of that then our awareness of ourselves is going to be subject to
exactly the same limitations and constraints and if it doesn't seem so well that's very interesting
and maybe there are good evolutionary reasons why it doesn't seem so
but let's ask ourselves why it doesn't seem so rather than just trusting that it actually isn't so
i think that the the one positive about it um well let's say illusionism is a theory of consciousness or
an idealism or panpsychist view is that all three of those have a better moral ethical implication in the sense
that we would treat all species around us in a similar manner whereas an emergentism phenomenon will
we'll we'll we'll break away that so you're you're no longer part of the same structure you're no
no longer similar in that regard so i guess there is that pro with it with these that's the moral
i tried to bring out in my my recent paper on the ethical implications of illusions i'd address
arguments that um worries that illusionism has negative ethical implications trying to show that
they're not well found out at all and then suggest some positive consequences and that's absolutely it i mean
if most views of consciousness actually um have this consequence that consciousness is a binary
thing it's either present or not okay it might be a phenomenal consciousness we took it um it might
be very limited very small it might be it's but it's like an inner light and there's either the inner
light is either on or off so there's a switch that goes up maybe when it goes on there's just a very very
very very very dim light or maybe suddenly it's like you know sort of the las vegas illuminations
come on but it's either on or off now that's i think and that's quite a natural view given that
if you conceptualize some consciousness as something irreducibly subjective well there's either an
irreducibly subjective world there or there isn't you can't be sort of a bit irreducibly subject you
can't have any there's another world subjective world that can't be just part of an you know half
there it's either there or there isn't one no matter how tiny it might be well so then you're going to
have to divide the world into the conscious sheep and the unconscious goats and if you're going to tie
moral worth to the possession of this inner light then you're going to have to say that the the the the
goats don't have intrinsic moral worth the best um with their instrumental value i think that's a
horrible picture actually um which is completely insensitive uh to the uh the way that uh creatures
are actually uh affected by the world um which we can see you know you don't really need to do a lot of
theory of theorizing to see when a creature's suffering it's it's it's kind of obvious really
um and yeah unless of course you locate suffering in some private world which is a really odd place to
it's a really odd to locate the primary source of ethical value in a world to which no one but the
individual in question has access it's really difficult to develop a shared ethics if you think
that ethical judgment should be responsible responsive to facts up to which we systematically
have no access whatsoever except in our own case that's a very simplistic sort of ethics i i find it
quite um i don't want to get too uh um too moralistic about it but i i think this is our view um and even
on views like pan psych's views which which say well uh this this inner light is is is in all uh the
fundamental particles of matter you still have a a binary division between those creatures in which
these micro consciousnesses of the their components combine to form a macro consciousness so you still
have this combination problem is still there the combination well it's not just the combination
bomb but the binary problem the the the the the sheep and goats problem is still there either it
either the micro consciousnesses have combined or they haven't and you've no way of knowing
yes you can just speculate and you can do a bit of you know some sort of a priori
theorizing about this but you know we're testing whether they do well you can test to their
reactions so seeing significance in the pattern of reactions in and isn't that where you should
locate it it isn't how what you're doing to the creature is affecting it in a concrete
why why not what what effects is it having on its psychology is it resisting is it producing all
sorts of distress reaction stress reactions yeah is it something the creature doesn't want you to do and
desperately want you to stop doing these are all questions which you can answer and which seem to
me directly what's happening in some other metaphysical realm associated with the creature to which you have
no access that seems a very odd way of assessing of assessing whether you should do it
yeah it's uh there's we in our last conversation we also went quite deep into the ethical implications
because that was also a part of what i focused on when when we do take ourselves out of that pedestal
and we move ourselves this heliocentric view or this anthropomorphic view of we are the most important
uh illusionism becomes a very very good ethical position i think so and i think it's it's it's
it's also bound up with the conception of the self i think this is very important this is something
that again dan had um uh revisionary views about the self he thought the self was something like a
narrative we tell about ourselves a construction the selective construction from events in our lives
that we put together to create a sense of who we are um and the continuing thing is this thread of
narrative that is linked of course to a particular body and human animal but our sense of being of
there being a self a private self is really a a a a a a a um the real it's more like the relation
an author has to their fiction we know ourselves because we are sort of authoring ourselves as we go
along so that's how we have we can offer uh um authoritative statements about ourselves not because
we have access to some to what we really are we can seem to have it in a nature and describe it to
others but we kind of expressing what we take ourselves to be in the way that an author is is is
is inventing the character that he wants to play a certain role uh and again this is the part of
breaking down this picture of the there being a presentation of something to an inner self
and then of course this connects up with free will because of this inner self then is supposed
to have the freedom to respond to what's presented to it in a completely unconstrained and unconditioned
way it's got uh it's it's it's it's got this presentation of the world it uh appreciates it in
some way like the spectator and then it's completely free to decide what downstream effects to have
on the dating picture all of that is is is a sort of imposition as a a a kind of fictional imposition
on what's really happening which is that you know this is a huge pattern of reactivity we are reacting
and then we are constructing ourselves as the authors of that reaction but does it where it's not that
there is a little thing that a little self that initiated the reactions it's that the reactions
occur and then we construct ourselves as the author of them and perhaps some of them we disavow and we
say oh i didn't mean to do that i don't know why i said that i mean i'm saying this now i'm thinking why
did i put that that way that was a bad way of putting it but it came out of my mouth so i i probably at
least it's been recorded i have to stand by it but uh in other cases when i'm um just playing around
with ideas or whatever i will say no no i don't mean that so why did i say that it's the self is
the bit is is is the portion of our activity that we that we endorse and author and um and hold on to
and of course we can also do this in us in a way that can be um somewhat damaging to ourselves if we
hold on to to to mistakes we've made and failures and incorporate those into ourselves and think of
ourselves as the person who made these mistakes the person who let these other people down the
person who who who failed to achieve things and build that into our narrative then that can in a real
sense become ourselves um and the the story we've constructed then has all kinds of effects
on how we later respond to other situations because if you're the sort of person who according
for the story does this or that then you'll tend to continue acting out that story yeah yeah i've
got another one here keith um yeah physicalism obviously true no i don't think anything is obviously
true yeah um uh no it's all a matter of trying to find out how things in the broadest sense of the
term fit together in the in the in the body sense of the term um no no no no in fact i i suspect
for a lot of people it seems obviously false i don't think what's obvious is always amazing
and it's obvious that the sun moves through the sky um the earth's flat there's all sorts of things
i see we're getting we're getting quite a few more questions now do you want to run through them so
this one's from tim stevenson ask keith if the perception of time is illusory in the same way
in the same way as the perception of phenomenal properties oh wow heck what a question i i certainly
think perception of time is something that's constructed by our brains uh and the question of
how that construction relates to concepts of time employed by by physicists uh i don't think the
brain probably constructs time using using the same sort of conceptual apparatus physicists use no
it's our a and b series or whatever um well that's that's metaphysics rather than physicists but um
i certainly think it's a construction whether it's as misleading a construction i it's an it's a
useful construction um it's useful and very inaccurate yeah and of course perception of time is um is is
very variable as you get older it runs much more quickly um so i certainly think there'll be
illusory aspects to it but it would depend on what you take what you take i think for instance i think
neuroscience and you know the cognitive sciences generally probably give us a good model of what's
occurring in the brain now what gives us a good model of what time is is less clear i suppose physics
i suppose ultimately but i think there probably might be as good a case for using the word illusory
as i think i think thomas metzinger talks about the summer that temporality um when he speaks about
it he does sort of hinder that illusory effect of it i mean we often perceive things as happening right
now when we never really are seeing oh well yes well we could have yes i mean there's got to be time
for everything to be processed certainly i mean literally yeah so quite literally in that sense
everything temporally is illusory but of course it's it's it's what's what's the um within that
thing but you can then uh you could you could take uh sort of a standard representation of time and
sort of saying you know that's that's that's normal representation and then have specific temporal
illusions within that so you could regard the baseline perception of time as as as practical uh reality
and then talk about specific temporal illusions that can be a different instance if you're in a
sudden car crash or something and it seems to slow down um so i suppose it's illusory relative to
what relative to what baseline so there's multiple levels of illusory effects of time here well there's
multiple levels of representation and the point about talking about talking about illusion is really
to stress that some of them are misrepresentations now they're probably all going to be
uh misrepresentations in some senses they're going to miss out stuff they're going to be incomplete
or all representations are going to be there um the point about talk using a word like illusory is to
stress that people are being misled about something that they feel confident about that's the point
um if everyone was used to say the mullalaya illusion everyone's completely used to it and used to not
trusting it at all um then the fact that it's an illusion wouldn't really be very significant
it's the fact that people are trusting their intuitions about phenomena conscious and directing
an awful lot of attention to building theories on on the basis of this uh misrepresentation
that's why you talk of illusions appropriate so it's it's it's it's pragmatic the value of the word
ziao young you i hope i pronounce that correctly asks is his views on determinism ask his views on
determinism sorry is he a compatibilist you of course uh yeah i'm certainly a compatibilist in
the sense that if determinism were true i don't think it would be any threat to free will uh whether
it is true is a matter for for for for for physicists i guess i don't think that introspection
gives us any reason to think that it's not true and i don't think that anything that matters
to us about free will is dependent on it's not on determinism not being true i think if the world
were completely deterministic we would just be as free as we are i think it's it's it's a matter of
it's it's a totally different kind of of of um set of concerns if you like um freedom doesn't depend
upon uh uh determinism being false that's what i think um but that's not to say that determinism
uh is true or false um don't think it matters to be honest this this question from michael addyman i
think asking which version of a physical brain in inverted commas exists inside his head as you two
said they're speaking eight billion human versions to choose from countless other animal versions
which perceptual model of a brain exists when no model is being rendered by an observer in principle
i'm not quite sure i understand about versions well yeah mine is the one that's been been shaped by my
particular genetics and my um particular uh uh experience um throughout my my my life it's been um
tuned up by a distinctive pattern of experience but which version of a physical brain that's so that
well obviously and uh the the uh other animal versions have been shaped by different genetics um uh
uh information different genetic codes and the other eight billion humans have been trained up by
different uh tuned up by different sorts of experiences which perception i said that which
perception model of a brain exists when no model is being rendered well that sounds a bit idealist
that's what uh that's what i'm getting from it as well uh well i'm not an idealist so
the brains exist unperceived um so uh if that if it's idealism is the the the then i i just don't um
just for those listening or watching we're looking on we're on twitter at the moment or x yes i'm
just i'm seeing this on twitter on my other screen here um any of these questions at the moment keith
that stand that stand out to you that you'd like to answer before i see i'm not sure if i've got them
all uh well i see one from argon oh yeah yeah go for that one do you believe philosophers ever
evangelize do philosophers ever spread the truth of a theory rather than explore the possibility the
theory is true um i suppose we do i was once someone once said it sounded like you were preaching
in that um in that talk and i suppose i was in that i wanted to um i do think evangelism good news
i do think illusionism is good news i say that i think it's i think it's i think it's a liberating
um perspective i think it liberates us from this prison of the south liberates us to really know
each other um to know the bats instead of thinking that the bats are just mysterious uh who you know
what they're in their lives are like who could know well we could know just study bats carefully
enough if you you know if you talk to people who've studied bats you might think you might be surprised
so i i think it's it's so maybe i do evangelize a bit in that way but i and when i talk about
trying to get people to see the perspective see another perspective argon goes to other by saying
should academics evangelize well i think i think there's a role for it there's a role certainly for
getting people to say come over here come and look at this view it's lovely it's really wonderful you're
missing something come and look at the rainbow you know it's lovely so i think there's a role for it
but that isn't the whole purpose it's not that i've just got this view i think it's wonderful
you know and i'm just going to try and use any means of advertising and persuasion to get people
to adopt it no i've got to back that i've got to cash out that sort of check that i'm issuing i've got
to it i've got to try and do the hard work of spelling out these attractions in a more um sober and
uh less rhetorical way and i hope i try to do that in my academic papers but i think there is a role
for trying to to get people to see why the picture isn't attractive why the sum of all that is an
attractive picture so yeah i mean we're human beings we don't just deal in in uh in emotionless
rational exchanges uh there's a role for saying this is good and bad yeah do you think that there
are things out there that exist as a standalone ontological primary of reality little bits of
stuff that come together objects what was the last bit of bits of stuff i don't see that when the bits
of stuff but at some point now people are just having their own discussions i don't think i mean
little bits of stuff i don't i don't know what that would mean but i think there's a there's a
i mean out there out where what was the question at the beginning yeah where is this do you think
that there are things out there that exist as a standalone ontological primary of reality out where
out there out there where what's what's what's in here yeah i think there's a world i think there's
a reality um and i think that the entity that i um pick out by the first person pronoun when i say i
is a bit of that reality um now what's is it made of bits of stuff i suppose stuff's about as vague a word
as you could use isn't it um what it all what's uh the fundamental nature of it all heaven knows um
uh but i don't think there's an in here and out there i don't really these questions sound like
they're coming from idealists do you find that idealists tend to disagree with you more than
panpsychists oh interesting question that one um this is from me now this is no longer this is just
oh that's from you now yeah oh well i see i i liked it um okay i'm gonna say something that may
may not be very fair and so perhaps i just wouldn't say but i i don't know there seems to be a certain
sort of culture i mean i i find idealism okay this this this won't sound good but i'm gonna say that
there's that i feel sometimes idealism is a bit cultish i i can see people seem to find a sort of
emotional comfort in it or i'm not quite sure what they find in it but they seem to find and it's
something that goes beyond its mere satisfactionness as a as a as a metaphysical theory that they find
something in it that that that deeply that answers to something that they really need and they i find
them more rather more aggressive or triggered yeah because if they fundamentally formed their
their entire life's ontology around this uh it is a lot more like attacking their religion in a sense
yes i think that's right whereas panpsych is certainly the ones i do with like philip
uh um i mean yeah philip believes it absolutely but he's also an academic philosopher he's been he he's
he's assessing this and the other theories in the way that an academic philosopher does
and he'll be quite passionate and but he'll also have powerful arguments but then when we've finished
it's just you know well that was fun wasn't it you know we each and and i think he i'm philip
understands my view i think pretty well i hope i understand his and i i hope we're trying to
regulate our interactions much more by the the norms of academic discourse and i don't think i'm
philip you know i feel about i said on my part there's no personal animus at all i enjoy talking
to and i find it i mean i i compared it these phenomenal realist positions to versions of chess
and some of these are quite interesting versions it's interesting to see what moves can be made
even if one thinks it's not really um uh capturing anything about reality i think ultimately the the
main goal should be having these discussions with with without sort of attacking people and and then
going going to like because i i can see some of the comments when people are trying to ask questions
for you if it's an idealist you can kind of sort of tell there's an animosity there and that needs to
be eliminated people need to have open discourse well as you say if it really means something point to
them i can understand it i've no wish to upset people or um and people should not wish to upset you
either because i mean that seems like i prefer not um but if it's if it's expressed i mean i suppose
there is a an interesting comparison with religion here that that religion people invest a lot of
their identity in it and they see it as foundational to their morality um and naturally if you do that
you're going to feel quite very threatened by its denial and you're going to feel that it's that
its denial has terrible consequences because it's the foundation of morality um and if you feel that
way well i suppose the ultimate the first question is are you interested in exploring whether there's an
alternative or are you just if you're if you're perfectly happy with that and you don't see any
problems with it you don't feel there's any tensions in it you don't feel it's creating any um dissociate
dissonance in you and you're not going and you're going to feel threatened or by anyone who tries to
articulate an alternative then let's leave it um
i must say when i spoke when i speak to idealist philosophers physicists scientists i often there is
a genuine uh respect for academia when they when some of them talk about it you can tell that they
dislike the fact that their followers make these cult leaders as well so so on their behalf i'd like to
actually defend them in that regard because many of them notice this and and don't particularly like
it either i think that's i think that's i think it's certainly true of uh of don hoffman who yes
most definitely for him um and he's one of those people i'm definitely referring to as well um but it
is it's an interesting cultural sociological psychological phenomenon that i'm not sure what it is about our
current i mean we could start getting into grand sort of speculation i have a theory of why it's because
a lot of them when when they provide you with their theory there's almost always a teleological
aspect and i think that really hits home with some people yeah the fact that there is a purpose now
because because with an illusionist view there is no there's not necessarily a teleological outcome
here we're still going through the universe in the middle of nowhere um what can we do whereas when
an idealist theory comes out there there often is something it's the universe trying to experience
itself uh various versions of itself the outcome is love there's purpose there is and and look there
are many different versions of idealism so i'm not speaking but um yeah it often comes with an
overarching theme that that is driven by a teleology that provides meaning yes it's um which is in
essence like a religion and if you do attack the philosophical view you're almost attaching attacking
the i i think that that's that's very plausible as you say there are many versions and so many idealists
and so it's difficult to generalize but yeah it's great for all those listening and watching i'm i'm
sorry for sound like no no i think it's i guess i've never really felt the need for that or even if
there was some objective purpose we would still be able to stand back and say well so what so this
objective purpose has been established but do i have to run along these rails that have been established
um i suppose in that respect i'm i have maybe existentialist tendencies i i think what i think on
the flip side the one good thing about most idealist theories is that they often do preach
very positive behaviors it's not that the other the alternatives are not are negative in essence it's
more that the alternatives do not preach it as much so uh there is that element of one does
talk about it a lot more the other is not negative inherently but they just don't go out there and
give you this um sort of moral grounding and purpose actively let's say yes yes am i articulating
that correctly do you feel like i don't know i'm not sure um one thing i mean like if we're
talking about um frameworks for doing consciousness science then um doesn't seem terribly relevant
um i mean you would hope that reality is is is is is fairly benign but um i don't um
i miss i can i can empathize with the idealist view in the in in so much as the aspect of reality that we
just don't understand so and that's as far as i can go and other than that all i can do is explore the
ideas but then there's also the pan psychos view which we have to consider and i wanted to ask you what
are your thoughts when dennett and the group of scientists philosophers all signed for the iit's
non-scientific approach to their work do you remember the infamous dilemma oh yes i signed it
yes i think i think i remember that and i've um and i've written a paper actually following up on that
um how did philip feel about that were you guys able to have a mindshed episode without having a little
bit of animosity well it's not technically going against philip it's more i'm not sure philip i'm
i think he's sympathetic to iot i'm not sure he's um i i i'm my take is that iit is is a metaphysical
theory that's um that's that's dressed up with maths um and to that extent is is is not regular science
because it starts with a bunch of uh a priori intuitions axioms uh that are just derived from
uh introspection now if you think that that consciousness is something irreducibly subjective
that there really is this this essentially private world that's what we're trying to
to do science on then that will be a reasonable way to start um there'll be no point in and trying
to define it in third person terms in terms of whatever it is how do you define memory for
instance well it's whatever processes are involved in in being able to recall information about the
past or whatever and you know they report relies reports about the past you can give us some kind
of operational definition i suppose definition in functional terms and you can do it with all
psychological um faculties and then you can say okay what are the mechanisms involved in producing
these effects now if you think that consciousness can't be divided in that way although this
the essential heart of consciousness can't that it's irreducibly subjective it can't be captured in
third person terms then you're going to have to approach it by you know your direct first person
acquaintance with it and you're going to have to start with some principles that seem to you
intuitively obvious and then you then you elaborate it and you derive postulates about the physical
correlates of the physical basis of these things and then you start doing all this elaborate maths
well yeah but that started with a metaphysical assumption about the irreducibly subjective nature
of consciousness and to that extent it starts with a metaphysical assumption that no other science
starts with yeah and all other science assumes you know this it's just you know it's just one reality
which can be investigated by third person means okay somebody's going to say quantum physics but you
know let's leave that out for a moment um so it's at least anomalous science and it's anomalous because
it begins with a metaphysical presumption that no other uh area of science has and if you think as
i do that that the metaphysical assumption is is deeply flawed then you're going to say well it's not
really science uh it's not um so yeah but then i would i would say the same of all uh uh science that's
that's that's predicated on that same metaphysical assumption um it's just a bizarre way of doing
science that you start with a bunch of things that seem to you intuitively true about it and
treat them as axioms and then start looking for objective features that might uh uh provide the
physical basis for whatever it is that is described by those actions no but no other we don't start
with saying look the sun is the thing that the sun there's a thing that moves through the sky now
what must the rest of reality be like for that to be true we don't do it that way anything any
observations can be corrected in the light of wider theorizing so if you start with some
introspective observations if you like though they're not thought of in that way and treat them
as axioms that define the shape of the whole project then that's a different way that's not the
way that the rest of science is done so it's the very least anomalous the yeah and i think that at
that point then obviously that would apply to many quantum theories of consciousness and you would
sort of have a similar approach yeah because when i put that stuart's very active on twitter hammer
off he's he goes at it with people yeah well i mean i mean there's all issues about com
computability that seem to me pretty much irrelevant to things to the heart problem because they're about
uh proofs and so on which um and also i just i mean the idea that observation plays some role um
without specifying what you mean by the observing subject and giving some account of that and on
which it's what's the metaphysical state of the observing subject is it just the animal is that you
know the whole cognitive what's the observing subject that come out i don't i don't understand how this
works out i don't see how you can get um features of an immensely complex system such as you know human
being to you can get explanations that sort of start at that level with the fundamental concepts of um
uh of uh basic physics but then somehow introduce elements from extraordinarily uh uh from a different
from a special science of an extraordinary complex uh physical beings namely psychology
i just don't see how you can get these into the same explanatory um um
discourse well keith in in terms of from an illusionist perspective if is there anything about
illusionism as a theory of consciousness illusionism according to how you define it and not to people
thinking that your consciousness doesn't exist that you feel that you haven't yet touched on or that
you'd like to reiterate because it's often going to be misunderstandings oh uh well illusionism is a a
it's a label for a way of looking at the the issues and a way of it's it's it's it's a it's
a label for if you like a program a bunch of questions to be asked okay um and it's a rejection
of certain questions and an introduction of a promotion of certain other questions in their place
uh now what answers you give to those questions the questions that illusionism poses
or asks you to focus on i mean there's going to be a yeah that is consciousness science as far as i'm
concerned that's you know that's that there's so much to do then so um much um that we don't know so
many possibilities so many theoretical possibilities and i'm just sort of waving my hands around a bit i
mean people there's people who are doing um much more detailed work in that um so my main aim is to stop
people obsessing over questions that i get people stop people going down a road that's leading to a
dead end and get them to go down the road that opens up into many many many more fruitful rights um
so again it's the the the stopping the the bad approach and promoting the good approach um
i think
there's a certain amount of compromise i can do with people who who who say look we can't give
up this approach we can't because it's just what we're most certain of it's what's supposed to bond
is the heart of the matter it's what we're trying to it's that's what's needed explaining and you can't
you mustn't tell us to stop asking those questions because those are the questions perhaps the only
really really important questions idealists would say well i can do a certain amount of negotiation with
them i can say look there's a question i'm asking that kind of does the same work as that pretty much
um just as in case of free will you can say well we don't have we shouldn't talk about absolutely
unconstrained free will but we can talk about autonomy and self-control and the mechanisms that
support that and that really does all the work that you think you're doing with that concept in fact
it does it better and more effectively and so i can say look i hear what you're saying i hear there's
something there that needs that needs explaining um but come with me over here and i'll show you that
i can give you most of what you want in fact something a little bit different from what you
thought you wanted but that does the work that you wanted and in fact does a lot of other work too
and the bits that it can't do don't really need doing anyway all the free will worth wanting as
Stan says all the consciousness worth wanting i can give you i can't give you a sort of it may be a
sort of consciousness that you want that just escapes the the the uh the the the physical um
i was going to say nexus but i'm not sure that's what that escapes the the physical world but if so
that wouldn't be worth wanting because it wouldn't wouldn't matter in the physical world and we live in
a physical world um so i can give you most of what you want and i can give you a bit more and i can show
you that the bits that i can't give you you don't really need anyway so i'm willing to do that sort of
thing so to bring people across and even to perhaps use some of the terminology that they
want to use if it's really important to them with a certain sort of adding a star or a prime or
something to it to just to indicate i'm willing to do all that but they have to meet me they have
to be willing to come over and have a look um if they just insist on banging the table that they've
already got it nailed down that the conception they have is already perfectly accurate that this is
already this is revealed to them um just in some uh primitive way in some fundamental weights revealed
to them whoever they are then i can't do anything um all i can do is say i i you know there's another
way of looking at it yes and if you're ever willing to to try and exploit i'll i'll be there it's an it's
illusionism is a it's an intuition pump for consciousness in a sense i it's a massive one
it's yeah it's it's a deliberately provocative i think the term has its value i think i can defend
the use of it it's a term that dan used a lot and that matters to me because i he's the he's my
uh my compass in all of this um dan wrote a paper called illusionism as the default theory yes i know
he wrote that and um so uh but it is a provocative word it's it's it's and if it offends people
then i i'm uh well yeah i don't i don't mean i don't mean to offend them i mean to shock them a
little or at least alert them to the shake them out of their complacency a little bit i do mean
to do that i do you mean to shake your complacency it's strategic might well it's a it's a good word
it's not it's not necessarily badly chosen because you want one you want a word that actually elicits
a response you can't just have some sort of yeah absolutely but once i've shaken you up then maybe i
can i can i can i can um restore your do a little bit to to settle you down again um and i think
that's probably one nick's word surrealism is is quite nice though it does suggest
i i don't know he what i i don't like the the fact that nick does continue to use words like
phenomenal properties i don't know that but surrealism isn't that but it's yeah well so
illusionism is more of an intuition pump to help you escape dacott's prison
yeah it's not it's not really even a pump because it's just a word but it's
yes it's a it's a it's a bit of rhetoric maybe in itself i mean if you if you take the word with
its meaning it can become a sort of an intuition yeah and the metaphor for me was always it wasn't
people it wasn't people being uh taken in by stupidly taken in by some by some trick it was
people going to the theater and seeing i i love illusions i absolutely love illusions and it's
people going to the theater and seeing a wonderfully crafted piece of stage magic which they know is
an illusion they're not under any they don't think that this guy's really levitating or something
um but they're enraptured by it it has a wonderful uplifting effect on it it's wonderful and i i think
if you like what the brain does this is coming back to nick's perspective on this i think that
this illusion is wonderful what the brain is this sense of ourselves and our and of our immediate
presence in the world as something as a little locus of of of of meaning and agency that's wonderful
wonderful story that we're crafting about ourselves and i i the effect is fantastic i mean i i i illusion
isn't a uh uh a a dis um derogatory term uh poetry is an illusion if you like it's it's it's it's a
or at least a an exaggeration a distortion of reality but for expressive purposes and that's
what i think that phenomenal talks this distortion of reality for expressive purposes again getting close
to nick again it's surrealism so um it's yeah surrealism is not a bad term nick is also very
he's an excellent thinker and i think oh that you guys are still on the same page slightly just
terminologies are just changing a little bit here and there it says not as well i think i mean the way
i want to see well i i love what nick's doing i think he's alongside dan he's been a major influence
on me and i see what we're doing as i i i don't know if he would agree with this but we're essentially
doing the same thing and we're sort of uh we've got different um i think that's we're addressing
different audiences possibly uh slightly and we're also got different techniques we're but we're operating
in in in in collaboration i think we're we're sort of advertising the same product but in different
ways if you like it's just like strategies just like the edition you you published all those years
ago when i was in 2018 i think it was i mean black moore humphrey you dinner yeah yeah yeah boom uh
camera you know it's all you guys just doing it doing the same thing and just a little different
here and there yeah and it's it's something of course that it's not something completely new
there's the uh this is another thing i've been um exploring a little bit recently is the history
of this there's although the name is relatively it's the position's been around quite a long time
i mean you have people like um um uh oh my goodness me i've forgotten his name right there um uh uh
um just
uh um dear me my my my brain is is not um it's not working i i i can't remember them but there'd be
people that um uh talking in it's very much the same brian farrell brian farrell 1950 paper in mind
called experience which is thoroughgoing um illusionism without it might even use the term
illusion at some point i think thoroughgoing absolutely got an influence on denner brian
farrell excellent paper 1950 mind everyone should read it so there's there's quite a long history um
of as soon as uh as soon as people started articulating physicalist views that this this has been an
option um and so the the real advantage of having the term is to collect these these closely related
positions uh uh under under under a a collective term so that their similarities can be emphasized and
their the different options um explored um last time we spoke we mentioned uh someone else we mentioned um
yeah even darren brown i'm also it's after well after speaking for almost two hours at two hours
this tends to happen darren brown i would have him on this podcast when it would be amazing to chat to
darren brown about the mind i would i would love to i mean i i called my i called my my blog tricks of
the mind which is a which is a homage to him i didn't actually borrow it i think from him unless
unconsciously but i realized that he'd written a book with the same i'd love to know what his views
on this i've read that book actually and it's he he's been someone i've always looked up to in terms
of the way he uses psychology to he did this wonderful thing which um he he
to traditional magicians had had presented magical effects tricks as supernatural yes and he did the
other he did this really clever thing he presented tricks off i suspect often very similar tricks
as not as supernatural but a super psychology yes and a lot of people thought that he was using
a real psychological techniques that they could perhaps learn so they could get this super psychology
too and maybe um sort of hypnotize people and convince people programming that was as much
that was just part of the trick it was there was no super psychology i mean i'm sure he's very smart and
very good at dealing with people he's a performer but the they would the tricks i think are just
basically standard mentalism and stuff like that um but presented in this fantastic way for a modern
audience as as as as as as bits of super psychology um as i'd love to know what he thinks about the
brain's own trickery that it performs um on its on itself um it would be interesting to to know if his
perspective as someone who who knows how effects are created exactly if anyone knows darren brown
anyone listening or watching send us his email address we need to we need to dissect i i i would
i would love to i'm assume he's very busy and yeah me too it's very um i've reached out once i
haven't had a response so i do know someone who knows him but i suspect his time is this is too
precious to we've got we've got to do it at some point we need to do it um yeah i'd love to unlike unlike
unlike uh uh most academics people people will pay um for his time uh as we do it we we talk for
vanity saying yeah he doesn't he doesn't need the boost to his self-esteem that comes from being interviewed
and he really enjoys the academic discourse you never know some of these people really are
really are intrigued he he's one of them though i i it will be very interesting to have the perspective of
of of someone who who knows how these effects are created uh uh to to look at some of the things
people say about the effects uh uh the um to look at introspective reports they know how perceptual
reports can be manipulated they know how people can be got to report seeing or not seeing things that
were actually there that i don't they're in front of them or not there in front of them how you can
manipulate people's perceptual judgments i wonder if they have any insights into how you can manipulate
people's introspective judgments um it would be an awesome person that would be a fantastic question
to ask certainly if you take the parallel i mean here's i'm sorry i'm getting tired so i'm just
free associating now that's interesting that the people really resist the idea of introspective
illusion but look suppose just take a naturalistic perspective if introspection is an evolved mental
faculty just like various forms of perception why wouldn't it be just as liable to illusion
misrepresentation as the various perceptual capacities are we all accept the perceptual capacities
are subject to misrepresentation illusion distortion why wouldn't introspection be the same and i i think
pulling at the back of all of this then it talked about cartesian gravity i think pulling at the back
of all this there's the cartesian sun which is substance dualness and i think it's that's what's
exerting this for the idea that really i am not something uh i am not just my brain uh and my
awareness is not just my brain being sensitive to features the world around it and reacting to them
it's there's something some other um something happening on another plane as it were and of course
you will you will you won't find many people who would actually endorse that strong form of substance
dualism but i think it's exerting a pull in the background and so you're having then it talked
about cartesian materialism which was people who were thoroughly going materialist and saying no it's
just a brain doing stuff but they still tried to conceptualize it in a way that retained some of
those intuitions that were true um on the on the on the on the on the dualist view so this idea of direct
acquaintance with mental qualities the idea that you have this this this this infallible knowledge
of what it's like to be you at least when you're paying attention and using the right concepts
that's something that doesn't really make sense within a thoroughgoing naturalistic perspective where
what you've got here are evolved representational mechanisms but it does make sense i suppose if
you've got an immaterial soul that is simple and sort of knows its own states just in some
fundamental way so i think there's this pull of the cartesian sun there um and substance dualism i see
i've noticed nowadays there's also a lot of dual aspect monists um this seems to be also quite a
a new growing philosophy yes well yes well it's it's just it that is just a way of of um
um if again it's it's a way of hanging on to key cartesian intuitions um dual as the nice thing
about dual aspect stuff is that you don't actually have to mess with the unless these things have
emergent causal powers you don't have to actually mess with the the physics there's no or any other
aspects of science you don't have to you don't expect these things to show up in any way but then
of course if they don't show up then how are you even aware of them if they're not making some
difference to what's happening in your brain how are you aware of them if you are just an embodied
uh if if you if you are just an embodied brain i mean if if if if that's all you are then if the
things aren't making any distinctive changes to the state of your nervous system then you won't be
aware of them um and you could say well yes but they're sort of aware of themselves well you know this
this brain state has an intrinsic nature it's intrinsic it's like something for the brain
state is nice for the brain state lovely the brain state is like something neural correlates are likes
and lovely what about me i'm not the brain state i'm the whole the whole organism how do i get to
know about what my brain state's like unless there's something else in my brain that's sensitive to the
intrinsic nature of that brain state and then produces certain distinctive effects and tells me
about that and so that i can report them as i i mean my whole body could be infused with a kind of
intrinsic wonderful intrinsic quality but if there's nothing tracking that no
psych no no mechanisms tracking that and producing appropriate psychological effects then it's
nothing to me my body could be infused with radiation or something and it wouldn't unless it's having
some effects what happens next as dan said you mentioned your you are compat compatibilist with
free will uh is it similar to dan's position and what are your thoughts on someone like dirk pierboom's
and gray caruso's approach oh oh now that's a tricky question because i've not really i've written a lot
much about incompatibilism i mean obviously dirk was part of your consciousness paper the
wasn't i think he was eh yes he was but he was he was writing about um about about the he's he's
different topic in his 2012 what he considers it not under the name illusionism he considers it as an
option alongside vasilian monism as another option he doesn't commit to either of them but he articulates
a version of illusionism as a theoretical possibility very clearly um for you will i i just i've never
felt the this again it's a cartesian intuition that i have to be something that escapes this
causal web in order to be able to be really active and responsible and that only seems to be a
uh that worry only gets a grip if it's like let me say it again it's that i have to escape the
the the the the causal web if i'm to be genuinely active and and morally responsible but that assumes
that i'm not already part of that causal web if i am just a certain portion of all that causal activity
that is what i am i am just a certain complex of of processes within a wider network of causality
then i'm having an effect and be and then can be held responsible in virtue of the causal processes
that constitute me i don't need to be uh disrupting those calls but in fact i couldn't because they are
what make me those are my actions my decisions are those particular causal processes that are basically
centered on this fleshy ball thing here okay so um it's only if you think of yourself as something
separate from all that that you're going to need to have a a a a the freedom to intervene in it
if you think all this stuff's going on here and this brain and this fleshy thing is doing its stuff
but i'm not really having a say in it that's because you're thinking of yourself as something
distinct you've got this cartesian intuition that you're something distinct and therefore you need to
somehow push around stuff uh in inside here so i just completely reject that another idea is i
suppose that if everything's were causally determined then the outcome would already be settled well
i just i don't really i mean that's that doesn't seem a consideration that it remotely enters into my
thinking about my activity in the world maybe the future maybe i mean you get exactly you don't need
to be a determinist to have this worry you can have it if you think that god now already knows the
future if you think that that there are there are facts about the future future facts um so you can
have that perfectly the same worry from a theological perspective if god already knows the future the
future settles there's only going to be one course it's going to go down and indeed only one thing is
actually going to happen on any of you and you can't given that a certain thing is going to happen you can't
go anything to make it not happen but then why would you want to have that sort of um uh power in
order to be able to do the things you're doing you know that's not stopping you doing anything um
uh it's not it's not confronting you as an obstacle in some way you can only do the things that you're
equipped and and and sort of wound up to do as in your particular by your but what has gone into making you
putting you in this position where you are going to act in certain ways is a hugely complex history
of of fine-tuning and exploration and adjustment and self-reflection and self uh manipulation and so
on and it's put you in this position where that is the thing you'll do next and that's an authentic
expression of you so what do you want i mean it's it's it's it's wanting to be a little god who can
be an uncaused cause and well i don't even think that would be a particularly that's even a particularly
coherent thing to want to be i mean what how would you make your decisions if you had this sort of
completely i just again i think it's an illusion that i mean i suppose one of the reason is that
we just don't know the spring we're not aware of where our decisions come to they seem spontaneous
because we don't know their their etiology we don't know their their uh the springs of action
are hidden from us or we can explore them a bit but there's always going to be further stuff that we
can't explore so it seems spontaneous to us and provided it's not constrained in unnatural ways what more do
i think once you reconcile yourself to being the kind of being you actually are you see that again
as dancers you have all the free will worth wanting you have all the consciousness worth wanting you have
the all the meaning and the purpose worth wanting it doesn't need to be uh validated on some
um a separate metaphysical plane it's it's so all the things that you want to be validated are all
you know the moral intuitions that you want to evaluate the purposes that you want to be imprinted
in the universe are ones that come from our that evolved nature anyway i mean the purposes that are that
uh that uh that uh that uh a lion would want to see implemented in the universe or that a that a spider or
uh a virus or heaven knows what sort of alien would want to see imprinted on the the nature of the
universe we're totally different from the ones that we want to that we we you know currently sociable
argumentative apes do yeah keith i don't think you realize this but that that photograph of dan
behind you the way it's he's it's almost like he's looking at you smiling at uh talking it's so it's so
amazing it's it really it was taken here in crete uh in 2018 um it's a nice photo isn't it yes and
the position i mean you must put it back in that spot hey don't don't do not move it from that spot
because it's as if he's looking at you smiling as you talk so proudly of him and it's and this one
actually got us to have the second conversation it was your tweet about your i think you did a lecture
on dan just a tribute to him and for that yeah i i did i did a lecture on the hard problem then i
used the second part to try and set out this what i'm provisionally calling reactivity schema theory
if the provisional title changes what do you think you would opt for there's something about reactivity
but um possibly calling reactivity schema the idea of schema is perhaps too specific it tends it suggests
just a simplified version rather than a distorted version it also suggests something that might be a
rival or an add-on to graziano's which it's not quite some arrival certainly but it might be an add-on
but i maybe want to it's it's more of a again i'm not in the business of constructing detailed
scientific theories i'm in the business of suggesting avenues for exploration and so i maybe want something
that's a little bit more open that says these are the sort of i'm i mean i i love interacting with
scientists but i'm not doing well i'm i'm asking i'm setting out questions for scientific exploration
so i maybe i want something a little more open um but um if you have any ideas let me know um key thank
you first of all this was such a wonderful conversation it's been a few years in the making which
is a bit too long so i think our next round will come very soon any final words from your side
uh yes let's let's uh but first of all thank you it's a pleasure to talk to you um you have a
fantastic podcast um i'm honored to have been one of the first guests and it's great to be back it's
great to talk to you as always because uh although i tend to talk too much we do have a there's a real
conversation going on where i feel that i'm i'm learning from you as well as hopefully um giving you
something to think about um so it's a pleasure to to talk to talk and let's do it again soon especially
given this rather alarming mention of mysterianism so i i i think i think uh it's been too long and
we need to um we need to i think i should change i don't actually want to be in that label i'd rather
just say i'm i'm just unsure at the moment uh i uh but i'm always convincing anything doubt is always
good um but um i i i i you've been one of the most um uh responsive and open-minded uh uh
uh uh people i've discussed this with you see you you you get what's going on dan used to say this
this as he would say um uh you get it um and it was a big compliment it meant thanks i tuned into the
right wavelength you know you you get it and i feel you get it and uh so that's what makes for a
productive conversation even if you don't endorse it yes at least getting it getting the idea getting
the attraction i i was i think some people think i'm just being i'm just being awkward or difficult or
contrary or maybe that i am not myself conscious um and uh that can be a little frustrating um i can
only imagine so uh having a productive conversation with someone who gets it is always interesting so
and as i said my intuitions are still very much the same as they were uh three years ago um just a
little bit more open-minded in a sense but yeah very much still i do understand exactly what you
mean when you say you have to backtrack you have to sort of defend and i see exactly why where and
when you have to do it and it's very difficult because with some audiences you need to you need
to sort of go on the attack and others you need to you need to you need to defend it's difficult to
pitch it whichever way i pitch it somebody's not going to like it pitched at that level it's not going
to work um um and of course you said about mysteries all i think all questions all explanations are
relative to some sort of framework um and the the bigger you make the question um eventually you run
out of frameworks within which they can be answered so if you're asking why is why is there something
rather than nothing there's no framework in that within which that question can be answered i don't
think it's just make the question and we have this amazing capacity to ask more and more general
questions and of course you're going to get to some point where there's no framework for answering them
now my point about consciousness is that that doesn't take us to that point where it's an ultimate
history that there are going to be questions that are beyond our ability to frame any uh any explanatory
uh the framework but consciousness doesn't pose one of those that's what i want to say i think that
for me the more the more i'm learning about this the more you i'm i know about it the less i feel
like i know anything about this and and i think it's a good way to live life in general because
that's often the case especially with the dunning-kruger effect i mean the more you really start
to delve into a subject the more you realize there's way more to it and that you really need to go
it's it it's a balancing act humility is definitely good definitely and i wouldn't want i don't i
wouldn't want people to think that i'm just happy that i've sorted it out um but you have to strike a
balance in that if you're going to argue for anything if you're going to put i see what i'm
putting forward a perspective i'm saying look at this that's an angle i think it's interesting i think
it's fruitful i think this could be the way to go come and have a look see what you think but i'm not
going to settle it whether i'm convinced or not doesn't really matter in the slightest
it's the question of whether these roads are going to prove fruitful yeah whether we're going
to find things going down and we need we need people like you to be doing that because then i
cannot have these conversations because you guys are the ones putting out the work that i'm talking
about i'm merely just joining in and and enjoy a bit more of that actually i think you're you're
underselling yourself a bit there but um certainly helping us to to to communicate i appreciate that
keith thank you so much once again i really appreciate your time you keep up the excellent
work always enjoy it you too yeah no definitely and i'm looking forward to we have a scheduled
lecture that you're going to give us soon and i'll i'll i'll definitely let everyone know once once we
get that done absolutely yeah fantastic devin great talking to you again thank you so much keith
