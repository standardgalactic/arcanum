So Whitehead was born in 1861. He died in 1947. He was born at Ram's Gate in the Isle of Thenet in the easterly most point of Kent in England.
And he was growing up as a child amidst Roman ruins and had a profound sense of history as a result, even from an early age.
I think I've mentioned in prior sessions that his grandfather was a descendant of George Whitehead, the Quaker religious freedom fighter.
And his grandfather and father were both educators who ran a boarding school on the Isle of Thenet.
And so Whitehead comes from this lineage of educators. At 15, he enrolled in school at Sherbourne in Dorsetshire, which is a school which at this point is almost 1,300 years old.
It claims Alfred the Great as one of its early pupils.
So again, you know, Whitehead's growing up with this rich historical context that, despite his inclinations toward mathematics and science, gave him a deep appreciation for the humanities.
By 1880, he was enrolling at Trinity College, Cambridge, to study mathematics.
Within five years, he became a fellow at Cambridge and began teaching himself.
And he'd continue at Cambridge until 1910 teaching mathematics.
While he was a student, he was a member of the famous Cambridge Apostles, which was a sort of club started in the 1820s by Tennyson, the poet.
And Whitehead recounts, as part of this group, the apostles, they would meet at 10 p.m. on Saturdays and continue in dialogue with one another.
Other students and invited guests, sometimes scientists or politicians and statesmen, poets and writers would join the students.
And they'd just continue talking until the early morning.
And so Whitehead says a lot of his education in philosophy and literature, which he wasn't getting in his mathematics classes, would occur during these conversations.
He would meet his wife Evelyn in the late 1880s.
They would marry in 1890.
Here's a picture of Whitehead.
Oh, that's Trinity College.
Here's a picture of Whitehead and Evelyn taken much later.
And he says in his short biographical statement that he wrote towards the end of his life that it was Evelyn's vivid life taught him that beauty, both moral and aesthetic, is the aim of existence and that kindness and love and artistic satisfaction are among its modes of attainment.
So Evelyn was very much a lover of the arts and literature and helped to round out, again, Whitehead's appreciation for these aspects of human life, even though he, by nature, was more of a mathematician and a logician.
Whitehead had three children with Evelyn, all born in the 1890s, all three, two boys, one girl.
They served in World War I in various functions.
One of Whitehead's sons, Eric, died in the Royal Air Force during World War I.
And he was shot down over France in March of 1918.
Quite tragic, obviously.
And here's a photograph of Whitehead on a pond outside his house where he lived in the first decade of the 20th century with one of his sons there.
I believe that's North and his daughter, Jesse, his son, Eric, was a bit older and so not joining them on this rowboat.
This is in Grantchester.
It's about three miles outside of Cambridge.
So this image, I think, is perhaps the best metaphor one could ask for for the deep structure of reality as Whitehead sees it, right?
These beads of dew on a spider web, each reflecting all the others.
And we'll get more into how this reflects Whitehead's process relational ontology.
I want to continue sharing a few more facts about his life, getting more into his philosophical and initially mathematical work.
In 1898, when he was still at Cambridge, his first book was published titled Treaties on Universal Algebra.
And this book, it formed the basis upon which all of his subsequent work on mathematical logic would build.
If you're familiar at all with the history of math in the 19th century, there were a number of important paradigm shifts, you know, moving beyond Euclidean geometry, which would later make the Einsteinian revolution possible.
So Whitehead was building on mathematicians like Grassman and Hamilton and Boole, who I mentioned earlier.
This book was important enough that it led to Whitehead being elected to the Royal Society in 1903.
Also in 1903, he would begin collaborating with Bertrand Russell.
Russell was initially a student of Whitehead's at Cambridge in the 1890s, but quickly they became colleagues and realized that their work on mathematical logic overlapped enough that they began collaborating.
They thought that they could publish the results of this collaboration, attempting to ground arithmetic in logic within a year.
It ended up taking closer to a decade, and it was this collaboration that produced the Principia Mathematica, three volumes, basically attempting to prove logically that one plus one does indeed equal two.
They didn't completely succeed in this task, but they opened up many avenues for further work in developing symbolic logic.
In many ways, this effort inaugurated the analytic approach to philosophy.
There was a fourth volume planned, but because of certain philosophical, as well as Whitehead says, sociological differences in their points of view, their collaboration ended around 1911.
Russell was a pacifist, and by the time the First World War had started, with all of Whitehead's kids being involved in that war, one of them dying, I think you can see how, despite their more than a decade and a half of friendship and collaboration, they sort of drifted apart.
Whitehead would leave Cambridge in 1914, or 1910, actually, he would leave Cambridge, and for a few years, he was drifting around teaching at different universities.
By 1914, he takes up a position at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, and he would teach there for 10 years, mostly applied mathematics.
He taught a lot of astronomers during this time, and he did a lot of administrative work, and it was here at the Imperial College, which was a new school at this time, that he began reflecting on some of the problems facing university education at this moment in history.
The traditional models where Cambridge or Oxford education was kind of reserved more for elites Whitehead felt was inadequate for the, you know, more growing middle class people clamoring for education, sometimes technical education.
And so he was struggling to figure out how to reform education, because he felt, ultimately, that unless education could adapt itself to this new kind of industrial technological situation, that civilization would be in dire straits.
So he saw this need for educational reform as one of the factors which might either doom or save civilization.
He has a book, Aims of Education, that collects some of his papers and addresses to different educational reform groups at this time.
And so in addition to all his work in math and logic and science and philosophy, he was also deeply invested in educational theory.
So by 1924, after a decade teaching at Imperial College, he was 63, I believe, at that time, and he was invited to take up a position in philosophy at the university in the other Cambridge, Massachusetts, at Harvard.
And he accepted, and he would teach at Harvard, and he would teach at Harvard from 1924 until 1937.
This is when most of his major philosophical books were written.
He reports in 1924 in the fall, when he began teaching his first philosophy course to the students at Harvard, that it was also his first philosophy course.
Of course, he'd been studying philosophy, but he'd never had formal education in it.
So, as is often the case with major, you know, paradigm changes, someone from outside the discipline within which they provide some new paradigmatic understanding is looking at the old problems with fresh eyes, right?
They don't have the disciplinary training that would tend to leave one stuck in the existing concepts and categories.
Whitehead's coming into philosophy, right, with fresh eyes.
And so the novelty of his scheme of thought is in some degree, to some degree, a result of this.
Whitehead says that philosophy is an attempt to express the infinity of the universe in terms of the limitations of language.
And I think this image of the spider web with the dew drops, each reflecting the others, is the perfect analogy for Whitehead's ontology, you know, his conception of the nature of being.
You may have heard of Indra's net, this picture that comes out of, I think, Madhyamaka Buddhism, the idea of dependent co-origination of all things.
That nothing has independent abiding existence but is rather caught up in a network of relations or causes and conditions.
And so you can't remove any of the nodes in the network without destroying the node and totally changing the rest of the network that it was embedded within, right?
This is the key to what a process-relational ontology is trying to reveal to us about the nature of reality, right?
Dependent co-origination, or you could say the interpenetration of all things.
Though in Whitehead's cosmology, there really are no things if by thing you mean an inert, isolated entity.
Whitehead's ontology is really composed of events, right?
Or processes, you could say.
And these processes for Whitehead are drops of experience, right?
So for Whitehead, there is no node in the network of reality that is not there for itself, right?
It is not enjoying some degree of experience or subjectivity or has some degree or capacity for feeling.
Whitehead's technical term for the feelings that each of these nodes in the network have of one another is prehension.
Prehension is like, you know, think of it as short for comprehension.
Comprehension usually implies more of a conscious, sort of rational, reflective understanding.
When Whitehead shortens that to prehension, he's trying to get at something that is not yet conscious, certainly not self-reflective,
but more of an aesthetic feeling of being permeated by the presence of the other beings in an environment without yet reflecting on the fact, right?
So prehension or feeling is a kind of unconscious apprehension, right?
So our conscious forms of apprehension or comprehension are a further elaboration upon a much more basic form of prehension or feeling that, again, Whitehead argued, pervades the universe at every scale.
And so each of these drops of experience in Whitehead's view is composed of its feelings or prehensions of all the other nodes in the network to which it belongs, right?
So there is no reality to any of the nodes outside of its feelings of the others, the other nodes in the network to which it belongs.
So this is similar to the kind of Buddhist understanding of emptiness, right?
There is no abiding self.
That's true whether we're talking about human experience or whether we're talking about the experience that Whitehead would say is present in even a subatomic particle.
And for Whitehead, a particle is more of an event.
It's a happening, right?
Particle is an abstract term that makes us think of an inert little bit of matter.
But in Whitehead's interpretation of 20th century physics, there's no such thing as a little bit of matter.
Photons are events.
They're happenings.
It takes a certain duration of time for a complete photon to manifest.
Similarly, you know, an electron, it's a vibratory happening.
It's doing something.
It is a doing rather than a thing, right?
And these doings for Whitehead are there for themselves, right?
There's something it feels like to be this electronic occurrence, even at the subatomic scale.
Now, as these events that compose the natural world continue to unfold over the course of evolutionary time, they begin to develop habits because they're all sort of evolving together.
And with each new drop of experience that arises from the network of feelings out of which it is composed, there's a little bit of novelty that each drop of experience adds to the network out of which it emerges from, right?
So that it's not just that each event that emerges from this network composing the rest of nature is determined by its relationship to others.
There's always a little bit of novelty with each new drop of experience.
And so there's a kind of reality at its fundamental basis is a kind of evolving relationship among all of these, Whitehead's technical term again, actual occasions of experience.
And as they co-evolve, new habits emerge.
And these habits allow nature at various scales to form what Whitehead calls societies.
And so an example of a society of occasions or experiential events would be hydrogen atoms.
The first hydrogen atoms, the first hydrogen atoms, which emerge, I think, a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, represent the growing together of what had been distinct processes, protons and electrons, to form this relationship that would be enduring, which we call the hydrogen atom.
So that's a society, right, of actual occasions of experience that has formed.
And then hydrogen atoms continue this evolutionary process and collect together into the first stars.
And a star would be another example of a society of actual occasions of experience.
And as these new forms of social organization are emerging over the course of cosmic evolution, what physics describes in terms of laws begin to take shape.
But again, for Whitehead, these are not eternally fixed laws imposed on the process of evolution that's unfolding.
Rather, what we call laws emerge from out of that process itself as a result of the creative relationships being formed by these actual occasions of experience.
And so rather than speaking of laws imposed from outside, Whitehead understands physical law in terms of the habits which emerge over the course of time as a result of relationships.
So for Whitehead, the task of philosophy is really to situate us in our experience.
His is an experiential metaphysics, right?
And as we've seen in our study of Goethe, the idea here is not to look behind or beyond experience for something which might be the cause of experience.
The participatory approach to science that Goethe and Whitehead were both attempting to articulate requires that we stay with experience.
So metaphysics, then, is not an effort to explain away our common sense experience.
It's really the effort to bring logical coherence and consistency to experience, to find the all-pervasive relationships among various aspects of experience.
And so science becomes the search for those relationships within experience, rather than the search for some mechanical explanation, which would be before, behind, or beneath experience.
Now, of course, there's more to experience than at first meets the eye.
And a great example of this would be, as we discussed in prior sessions, this important paradigm shift out of the old geocentric conception of the universe into the Copernican heliocentric understanding.
It looked, before Copernicus, as though the Earth was the stationary center of the universe.
But using the methods of geometry, Copernicus was able to successfully argue that, in fact, the Earth is in motion.
And now we've sent probes to the Moon, we can observe the fact that the Earth is in motion.
This image was taken by a Japanese satellite orbiting the Moon.
So this is an actual image of Earthrise on the Moon.
And so the lesson here, rather than the Cartesian lesson, which said, nope, I guess we can't trust our senses.
We have to use math to understand a physical world which would be forever beyond our sensory experience.
The lesson for Whitehead, as for Goethe, is that, well, we can't ever actually get outside of our experience.
The Cartesian conception of res extensa, or extended matter, which can be measured precisely in mathematical terms, that's an idea.
Cartesian matter is an idea, right?
If we want to do science in a way that is empirical, we need to come back to our experience and understand, on an experiential basis, how it is that the Copernican understanding of a moving Earth can still cohere with our sense of an experiential horizon, right?
And so there's a paradoxical way in which, in light of modern cosmology, we can say every point of the universe is in some sense at the center, right?
There's this old hermetic maxim, that the universe is a sphere, whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.
I think this is still an adequate account, even in light of all that we have learned in modern cosmology.
And so, yes, of course, the geocentric understanding that the astronomer Ptolemy put forth with all of its epicycles and other machinations attempting to explain the wandering motions of the planets, so-called retrograde motions.
We've advanced beyond that to a simpler understanding, and yet, at a deeper level, we can still see how we live in an omni-centric universe, right?
And we can also see how, although for Copernicus, replacing the Earth with the Sun as the stationary center of the universe, now we know the Sun itself is moving, the galaxy itself is moving, motion is totally relative.
There is no absolute space by which we could determine the absolute motion of this planet or that star or this galaxy.
We have a map here of our galaxy situated in space within its local neighborhood.
Some of you may know that Andromeda, which is sometimes visible with the naked eye or the telescope, it's actually hurtling toward the Milky Way and will eventually collide with the Milky Way.
This is our local context, right?
And so, everything is orbiting around everything else.
We can also consider our cosmic situation temporally.
This is a simulation of how matter congealed after the Big Bang.
This formation of the first stars, this sort of rhythmic process of expansion and contraction, right?
It's an archetypal phenomenon, this expansion and contraction that Goethe later perceives in the plant realm, in the animal realm, but it was active many billions of years ago in the formation of stars.
From Whitehead's point of view, all of that cosmic activity is folded into us right now.
It's not somewhere else, right?
It's not left behind in the past.
It has perished, but in some sense, it is still contained within us, right?
So, the archetypal phenomena of expansion and contraction that we saw active in that simulation, again, is now still evident in the expansion and contraction in the various phases of plant metamorphosis, right?
So, let's, after having zoomed out, right, into this sort of fractal context at the galactic and cosmic scales, let's try to come back to Earth and situate ourselves.
Because, as Goethe reminded us, it's quite difficult for us to even imagine these cosmic magnitudes, billions of years, billions of light years, of spatial distance, billions of years of time.
So, these sorts of magnitudes are so far beyond our capacity to grasp in terms of human proportions.
They're just very abstract.
And both Goethe and Whitehead were worried that as modern science advanced, we were increasingly replacing, we were in a rush to replace our concrete experience with these abstractions.
And this can be quite disorienting.
Let me remember this quote I shared last time, I think.
Whitehead says that philosophy has to rescue the facts as they are from the facts as they appear.
We view the sky at noon on a fine day.
It is blue, flooded by the light of the sun.
The direct fact of observation is the sun as the sole origin of light and the bare heavens.
Whitehead continues.
And so the analogy here is,
While metaphysics must be grounded in experience, experience as it first appears to us may be deceiving.
We have to stay with the complete round of metamorphic process, as it were, in this case, the complete day-night cycle,
before we can have a complete sense for the phenomenon in question.
If we only had the daytime view of the sky, we would totally miss this broader cosmic context revealed when the sun sets.
And so even though it seems like during the day, with the bright light that we're seeing everything as clearly and distinctly as we could ask,
be patient.
The metamorphic process is not yet finished.
And so this is an analogy for the way in which both Goethe and Whitehead insist that we stay with the phenomena in their archetypal process,
in their morphogenetic process,
so that we stay with the evolving relationship between perceiver and perceived,
and not rush to conjecture something that would be behind phenomena,
something that would be unperceived,
but not just unperceived now,
but unperceivable even in principle,
that might explain our experience of the phenomena.
So you remember last time I talked about Goethe and his understanding of theory in the original Greek sense,
as contemplative observation,
theory as in theoria related to theater.
And in the context of theater,
if we want to understand the meaning of the play,
we don't pull the curtain back and look in the dressing room.
We watch the action unfold on stage.
We wouldn't be satisfied seeing what was going on in the dressing room,
right?
The whole meaning of the play would be lost.
We'd see,
you could say we're seeing the,
the typical sort of scientific,
modern scientific metaphor here would be,
oh,
well,
we do want to pull the curtain back.
We want to see the inner workings.
We want to see the guts right behind the scenes,
but from a Whiteheadian or a Goetheian point of view,
it's not that there aren't many layers of experience to pull back.
It's just,
even if we were to pull the curtain back,
we're still dealing with experience at a different level.
And the worry for Goethe and Whitehead is that we forget sometimes with the typical scientific method that we can only ever apply concepts derived from our empirical experience.
And so if we're trying to understand experience as if it were really an illusion produced by collisions of particles or brain chemistry or something that we can never in principle experience,
what we're doing is applying concepts derived from our experience to an imagined realm that we think is beyond experience.
But it's not.
This is Whitehead's fallacy of misplaced concreteness.
We're imagining an abstract realm in terms of concepts derived from experience and saying that that realm could cause experience.
And so we're getting confused about what's abstract and what's concrete.
So it's true that there's often more to the phenomena than what at first meets the eye.
But the remedy for that situation for Goethe and Whitehead is to be patient, to look deeper,
to stay with the metamorphic process until we're sure that the whole has revealed itself.
Whitehead says,
In our experience, there's always the dim background from which we derive and to which we return.
We are not enjoying a limited doll's house of clear and distinct things, secluded from all ambiguity.
In the darkness beyond, there ever looms the vague mass, which is the universe begetting us.
And so the vague mass is not only the full spatial extent of the universe as it exists now,
but the depths of time, the generative process that has given rise to this spatial extent.
And all of that, as I was saying earlier, though we might think of the past as having perished,
it remains present within us, another Whiteheadian technical term,
it is objectively immortal.
The effects persist within us today, even of events which occurred billions of years ago,
because the universe is a temporal process constantly building on what's been achieved in the past
in order to achieve yet more complex things in the future.
So I want to now introduce the key concept in Whitehead's mature metaphysics, concrescence.
Concrescence is derived from a Latin term, which literally means to grow together.
And I'm using daffodils here as a sort of metaphor for understanding how concrescence is ultimately an organic process.
And it's Whitehead's attempt to describe a universe composed of events, right?
Concrescence is a description of the phases in the process by which reality advances out of the past,
through the present, and into the future.
Concrescence occurs in our own experience as conscious human beings.
So it's a general description of what occurs both in our own experience as conscious human beings,
as well as in electromagnetic phenomena,
as well as in any moment in the life history of the sun,
or any other organism, biological organism, on the surface of the planet.
It's meant to be,
concrescence is meant to be a general enough description
that it can apply at all these different scales of reality, right?
So you should sense the analogies to your own experience as a conscious human being,
as you advance from moment to moment of your life history.
But Whitehead intends concrescence to also be applicable
to events at every other scale of nature, right?
Because for Whitehead,
metaphysics is an attempt to devise a language
that is general enough
that it can be applied to all experience.
It can be applied to what all the special sciences are describing.
It can be applied to human conscious existence,
morality, art, religion.
He wants one scheme of categories,
which applies to this ultimate context.
And he's admitting also right at the beginning of process and reality
that this is a hopeless quest.
His system will not finally be adequate,
but he's trying to get as close as he can,
and he's inviting us to continue the effort.
So he says that concrescence is the process
by which the many become one
and are increased by one, right?
The many here refers to the past,
the perished objects in the past environment.
There's another domain that Whitehead makes reference to.
He is a Platonist in this sense,
though he's a reformed Platonist.
He makes reference to this realm of eternal objects,
which for him are pure possibilities.
I was mentioning Tim Eastman earlier.
He calls this domain res potentia,
the realm of possibilities which have not yet been actualized.
And so for Whitehead,
the realm of possibility is infinite.
The realm of actuality is finite.
In the realm of actuality,
there's a limited amount of certain types of experience
which have been realized.
But the realm of actuality draws upon this plenum of possibility,
and it's because there is this plenum of possibility
in relationship to the realm of actuality
that novelty is possible.
New things can still happen.
We're not just constantly repeating the past, right?
Whitehead describes the process of concrescence
or each drop of experience as dipolar,
having two poles.
There's a physical pole and a mental pole.
Each concrescence or drop of experience
begins with the physical pole
where the perished objects of the past environment
are prehended or felt,
and these feelings of the past grow together
into this newly emerging drop of experience.
And then in the process of their growing together,
the actualized perished objects of the past environment
are brought into comparison
with eternal objects
or pure potentials, possibilities,
and these possibilities ingress, right?
So there's ingression of eternal objects
and prehension of past actualities,
ingression of potentials,
prehensions of past actualities.
And what the ingression of eternal objects do
is provide each occasion of experience,
each concrescence,
with the opportunity to interpret the past differently.
To say, oh, maybe it's not like that.
Maybe it's like this.
And so these ingressions come into the mental pole,
right, which is the,
if the physical pole is what initiates
the experience of each concressing occasion,
the mental pole is a subsequent process
that compares what's been felt in the past
with what is possible,
alternatives that could be experienced
that are not given yet in the past.
The subjective form is how the occasion feels the past.
The subjective aim is what draws
the many feelings of the past
towards the unification and the mental pole
where the ingression of eternal objects
and the feelings of past actualities
are brought together into what Whitehead calls
this moment of satisfaction.
It's the culmination of the process of concrescence
where a new perspective
on the universe is achieved.
This is,
if the many have become one,
they are increased by one
when this satisfaction is achieved.
It's a new perspective on the whole.
As soon as this new perspective is achieved,
it becomes a superject,
which is not a subject enjoying its own experience anymore.
It's a perished subject.
The superject is the achieved perspective
that has been experienced,
but then perishes itself
into a superjecthood
to become one among the many
that will be inherited
by the next moment of experience,
the next concrescence.
And this superject has objective immortality
in the sense that
every subsequent concrescence
will inherit the satisfaction
achieved by the prior concrescence.
And so this is the most general account
in Whitehead's view
that we can offer of the nature of reality,
the nature of the passage of nature,
the movement out of the past
through the present and into the future.
Experience is always in the present, right?
And the satisfaction that is achieved
by each moment of concrescence
is enjoyed in the present.
But as soon as we achieve that,
it perishes
and the next moment of concrescence arises
to inherit what was achieved.
And this is an iterative process, right?
It's repeating constantly
and it's cumulative.
It's a process of growth,
building on what's been achieved in the past.
This is the Castle Rock of Edinburgh.
Whitehead has this famous example
of how concrescence works,
even in the inorganic world of rocks.
A rock may seem like an inanimate object
that's just kind of sitting there,
not doing anything.
But we know
that at the molecular level
and certainly the quantum level,
even rocks are pervaded
by energetic activity.
So Whitehead says,
the Castle Rock of Edinburgh
exists from moment to moment
and from century to century
by reason of the decision
effected by its own historic route
of antecedent occasions.
So Castle Rock
maintains its form
because all of the concrescences
which are taking place
are repeating the past
with a high degree of fidelity,
though weathering is occurring
and the rocks are breaking down gradually.
But nonetheless,
the rock composing this structure
persists
because of this process of inheritance.
Whitehead refers to the historic roots
of antecedent occasions of experience
that are maintaining the form
of even rock
over the course of centuries
by inheriting feelings from the past.
Now, rocks,
because of their lack of organization,
don't have as much capacity
to ingress alternatives
to what's being inherited from the past.
And so rocks largely remain the same.
There's no sign of life,
which would be the ingression of novelty.
When you get to the level of complexity
of living organisms,
there's much more capacity
to ingress novelty
to not just repeat the past,
but to do something new.
But for Whitehead,
there's no ontological break
between, say,
inorganic matter
and the biological world of organisms.
For Whitehead,
this idea of organism
can be generalized.
Hydrogen atoms are organisms.
Stars, galaxies are organisms
of less complexity
than cells
and multicellular plants
and animals,
but nonetheless,
organisms in the sense
that they are societies,
historical roots
of occasions of experience
that have been organized
over the course of time.
They're not just inert stuff
that are sitting there
without any active process
in each moment
composing them.
So, in addition
to concrescence,
one of the other
key categories,
key concepts
in Whitehead's
scheme of thought
is creativity.
Creativity is
the ultimate
in Whitehead's
conception of reality.
if you were to ask
what is reality made of?
What is the universe
ultimately composed of?
For Whitehead,
it's not matter anymore.
It's not space anymore.
It's creativity.
Creativity is what reality
is made of.
And it's not a substance.
It's a process.
And it's never the same twice.
But,
this is where Whitehead's
process theology comes in.
Creativity
can only appear
under conditions.
And the initial
condition for Whitehead
is what he calls God.
The primordial nature of God
to be specific.
So, if we have
the world of actual occasions
which I've been trying
to describe for you.
Finite creatures,
right,
that exist in the world.
And we have different forms
of leaves and flowers here
to represent that.
this world of actual occasions
from Whitehead's point of view
emerging out of creativity
is only possible.
Finite form
is only possible
because creativity
has been filtered
by the primordial creature
which he terms God.
Now,
we don't have to use
the term God
to refer to this.
We could just think of
the initial conditions
that physicists,
cosmologists
sometimes refer to
as having fine-tuned
the physical laws
of the universe
so that,
you know,
forms of organization,
stars and galaxies
and life
could emerge later.
There's a very small range
of the numerical values
of physical constants
and laws
that would allow
for life to emerge later.
In Whitehead's view,
these constants,
this fine-tuning
is established
by the primordial creature
and he calls it God
but it's kind of odd
to refer to God
as a creature
if you're familiar
with most Christian
or Judaic
or Islamic theology.
God's the creator
not a creature,
right?
But no,
Whitehead's saying
creativity is ultimate.
God is the first creature
of creativity
and God's role
as the first creature
is to act
as a kind of filter.
You could think
of creativity
as the realm
of possibility
or eternal objects
that I was describing
in the last slide.
God's role
is to give some order
to that realm
of possibility
and to say
these possibilities
are more beautiful.
So Whitehead's God
envisages
the realm
of possibility
and gives it
some ordering,
some sense
of what would be
more valuable
to realize.
And so I've put
a Gertian color wheel
in here
to symbolize
the way
in which
this primordial creature
is giving
some order
to the realm
of eternal objects.
Now this realm
of eternal objects
I should have mentioned
earlier is not just
like mathematical forms.
It's also
the qualitative domain
of colors
and sense
and sounds.
It's the realm
of sort of adjectives
and adverbs
by which we describe
our experience.
The definite possibilities
in terms of which
we can characterize
the various facets
of our experience.
The primordial nature
of God
is giving
some order
to this realm
and each
finite occasion
of experience
like each moment
of our own
stream of consciousness
or each moment
in the life history
of a flower
say
is inheriting
God's primordial nature.
Whitehead calls this
the initial aim
and this initial aim
gives to each
finite creature
a sense of
relevant novelty
or relevant possibility.
The realm of possibility
itself is infinite
and if each of us
as finite creatures
were exposed
to that realm
with no filtering
we'd be completely
overwhelmed.
We'd have no idea
which possibilities
were relevant
to our finite situation
and so the role
of God
is to provide us
with a sense
of relevant novelty
through this
initial aim
that is granted
to us.
God doesn't control
how we decide
to interpret
our experience
but God
provides
a sense
of relevance
within which
we can then
freely decide.
Each creature
for Whitehead
is self-creating
but there's
some divine assistance
in each moment
of our experience
that's sort of
whispering in our ear
hey this might be
the most beautiful
way to interpret
what is going on
for you right now.
Whitehead says that
God provides
to each creature
a mirror
reflecting its
own greatness
what it could be
in each moment.
Now typically
we don't live up
to that highest
potential
in each moment
but nonetheless
there's enough
of this initial aim
ingredient
in each moment
of our experience
that over the course
of billions of years
the universe
has tended
towards greater
organization
and complexity
and indeed
in Whitehead's view
greater beauty.
Greater beauty
doesn't mean
everything's fine
and dandy
and there's no
suffering.
For Whitehead
the highest form
of beauty
is actually tragedy
right so keep
that in mind.
Like every other
creature
Whitehead's God
is dipolar.
God has a
mental pole
and a physical
pole
though unlike
the depiction
of concrescence
I gave you
in the last slide
God's experience
is reversed.
The mental pole
comes first
the physical pole
comes
consequently
right
that's really
the only difference
between God's
experience
and the experience
of any finite
creature
it's the order
of the phases
or the poles
so God's
mental pole
is the ordering
of the realm
of possibility
God's physical
pole then
is that which
feels
the decisions
made
by all the
finite creatures
as they achieve
satisfaction
in each moment
of concrescence
God's consequent
nature is sort
of this cosmic
memory
whereby
nothing which
occurs in the
experience of
finite creatures
is lost
it's all
preserved
and it's
preserved
in a way
that
Whitehead
says
is harmonized
with God's
ideal vision
of what could
be
and so
you can think
of God's
consequent nature
as in some
way
the atonement
for
even
the
mistakes
made
even the
tragic losses
that we
experience
in our
lives
as mortal
creatures
God's
primordial
nature
you could
say
is
Whitehead's
way of
accounting
for
as I
said
the
sort
of
cosmological
fine-tuning
in terms
of which
or by
means of
which
an ordered
self-organizing
universe
could unfold
the consequent
nature
I think
is
Whitehead's
attempt
to
provide
some
sense
of
justification
for
our
human
need
I would
say
we can
discuss
whether or
not
this is
a real
need
sort of
intrinsic
to human
nature
but our
need
for some
sense
of
meaning
and
ultimate
purpose
to
existence
without
this
consequent
nature
of
God
to
provide
a sense
of
immortality
for every
experience
which has
ever
occurred
and not
just
immortality
but
atonement
that gives
meaning
and puts
even
the experience
of loss
and suffering
and tragedy
into a
greater
context
within
which
some
purpose
can be
revealed
Whitehead
thinks
human
beings
would
have
no
basis
for
civilized
life
we would
just
spiral
into
nihilism
and so
the
consequent
nature
of
God
is
a
response
to
the
sort
of
anthropological
need
that
human
beings
have
for
meaning
whereas
the
primordial
nature
of
God
is
more
of
a
most
cosmological
genetic
code
in terms
of which
we can
understand
how
the
universe
could
be
so
ordered
right
now
it might
seem
like
these
are
two
gods
and
indeed
there's
lots
of
debate
among
process
theologians
about
how
these
two
aspects
of the
divine
fit
together
but
Whitehead
certainly
intended
to
describe
one
God
one
soul
of the
world
if you
prefer
to use
that
term
because
unlike
traditional
conceptions
of God
as
creator
Whitehead's
God
is
involved
in the
world
Whitehead's
God
he says
is a
fellow
sufferer
who
understands
so
world
soul
might
be
the
better
term
than
God
in
that
sense
but
Whitehead
intends
it
to be
one
God
with
these
two
aspects
to
it
finally
Whitehead
says
nature
is
plastic
although
to
every
prevalent
state
of
mind
there
corresponds
iron
nature
setting
its
bounds
to
life
there
are
stubborn
habits
in other
words
that
condition
and limit
the degree
to which
we can
express
novelty
in the
next
moment
it
is
a
false
dichotomy
he
continues
to
think
of
nature
and
man
or
nature
and
humanity
mankind
is
that
factor
in
nature
which
exhibits
in its
most
intense
form
the
plasticity
of
nature
plasticity
is
the
introduction
of
novel
law
right
and
so
rather
than
think
of
laws
as
eternally
fixed
as
the
creative
advance
of
nature
continues
new
habits
are
being
established
which
provide
the
basis
for
yet
further
novelty
the
doctrine
of the
uniformity
of nature
right
that
that the
laws of
nature
so-called
apply
across
the
entire
cosmos
there's
not
remember
that
in
ancient
cosmology
there
was
this
conception
like
in
aristotle
that
the
laws
as
they
apply
below
the
moon
are
quite
different
from
the
sorts
of
laws
that
apply
above
the
moon
in
the
super
lunar
sphere
above
the
moon
it
was
thought
all
motion
was
in
perfect
circles
the
beings
above
the
moon
were
eternal
and
divine
below
the
moon
everything
is
corruptible
motion
is
erratic
right
that's
the
old
conception
of
a
sublunary
and
superlunary
division
the
scientific
revolution
destroys
that
division
we have
a sense
of
universal
laws
right
an apple
falling
from a
tree
follows
the same
rules
as the
planets
orbiting
the sun
as
Newton
revealed
so the
doctrine
of the
uniformity
of nature
very
important
doctrine
is to
be
ranked
with
for
Whitehead
the
contrasted
doctrine
of
magic
and
miracle
as
an
expression
of
partial
truth
unguarded
and
uncoordinated
with the
immensities
of the
universe
so what
he means
by bringing
in magic
and miracle
here is
these were
ancient
ways
pre-modern
ways of
understanding
what for
Whitehead
is
novelty
the
capacity
for
occasions
of
experience
as they
can
crest
to
ingress
novelty
and not
just be
determined
by law
or by
the
habits
of the
past
nature
is always
advancing
into novelty
for
Whitehead
and he
thinks
that the
ancients
understood
this
in terms
of magic
and miracle
and that
we have
to
bring
that
ancient
understanding
into
coherence
with this
modern
understanding
of the
uniformity
of nature
where
miracles
are not
supposed
to happen
but
before life
emerged
on earth
it would
seem that
the universe
was a
purely
physical
and chemical
process
and that
life appears
in that
context
it seems
like a
miracle
but for
Whitehead
that's not
a miracle
as though
a god
was required
to reach
in to
the machine
to arrange
physics and
chemistry
to make
life possible
no
physics and
chemistry
from
Whitehead's
point of
view
were never
simply
dead
mechanisms
right
they were
always
already
on their
way
to
what
we
refer
to
as
the
biological
world
of
living
organisms
so the
emergence
of life
is not
a miracle
in the
old sense
requiring
some divine
intervention
it's just
a further
expression
of this
process
of novelty
that
ingresses
over the
course
of evolution
so he
says our
interpretations
of experience
determine the
limits
of what we
can do
with the
world
word
moment
Thank you.
