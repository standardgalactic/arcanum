in this episode the ego book was a result of like a 10-year process or like a very kind of
long process of studying altruism actually and right when i started studying altruism
i immediately got into these weird self-interest types which is like there's group altruism kin
altruism uh reciprocal altruism and i did some studies about reciprocal altruism about how you'd
think this would work but people seem to want to not get things back so like for for instance if i
was to say hey hey mate uh i'll come over and um or could you come and help me put my car together
versus like uh versus that might be more appealing than could you come over and help me put my car
together then i'll go over and fix your bike if it breaks down like for some reason this is less
appealing to people even though concretely you will be getting my services as a bike repair person
and it's an exchange but people would rather do something for nothing so this was like the first
kind of thing that i said that's kind of weird like so there's this problem with game theory which is
game theory says what's the most rational you know yeah rational agents but as as it kind of turns out
in vivo um there's different processes going on and you could say these processes are broadly
psychoanalytic in character and that self-interest really you know has to go into feeling and intuition
and that's why the book starts with like dreams as the most reflexive intuitive core so you can take
that and kind of see this example of uh you know group altruism or kin altruism like i will do this
because you're a part of my friend group or a professional group or a family right um that is
more powerful than i will do it because i will get something concretely in return hey everyone welcome
to my conversation with the writer and psychotherapist elliot rosenstock and uh apologies for the background
noise it is extremely windy here today in melbourne uh leaving that aside elliot is the author of two
books uh one of them being jerk in the clinic and the other his latest book being the ego and its
hyper state and elliot's an interesting character if i could say um he is working on this broader let's
call it his existential project of bringing life into psychology he calls it hyper psychology but he
prefers just calling it psychology as such where instead of making psychology this sort of taxonomic or
categorical discipline where you categorize you know a person's got hd or person's got anxiety
ocd or whatever categories we create we bring in the broader question of life into the praxis and even
theory of psychology um and he does this through bringing in philosophy specifically the work of hegel
and then the meta psychology of freud and when i was reading his work uh well reading the books which
i have to admit i'm still getting through oh i'm still trying to grok in some sense because i haven't
really got my head around all the concepts yet but when i was reading his books and also
listening to his other podcasts and public interviews one thing i felt intuitively was that
he's trying to bring in the the the the the idea or the notion of human dignity back into the field of psychology
which for me at least in some sense has become a very mechanical almost a human alien discipline
which ironically attempts to study the uh human subject and it doesn't feel like it's studying human
beings anymore but rather these abstract concepts of of what a human being is through different uh
yeah psychological categories as i didn't mention and i felt like he's trying to bring in this idea
of human dignity and life back you know psychology and when he went when i did say that during the
conversation i feel like it really clicked with earlier too or i wouldn't say clicked it rather i could
see that the idea of bringing in dignity he he almost like lit up he really liked that idea and that for
me was a good thing because i i felt like that's kind of what i felt too while reading his work
um and also on top of that he's never explicitly used that term in his in his writing uh and i'll
even say which is one reason why even though i do talk to a lot of psychologists people and psychology
psychology has never been an interest of mine uh it's always been theory and philosophy because for me
philosophy still goes to that question of life whereas psychology it's become a bit more of a
a tepid vanilla sort of discipline where you're trying to just categorize people and for me that
doesn't really do much so at least i don't find that interesting in any case uh before we get to
the conversation as i tend to do a bit of a formal introduction to elliot elliot rosenstock is
a psychotherapist and i should add writer he is the editor of the young freudians magazine an
experimental philosophy and psychology journal that provides ideas on everything from new ideas and
psychodynamic therapy to eco theory he's the author of jack in the clinic and ego and its hyperstate
and i probably should mention uh the links to both those books are in the description down below
in fact the jack in the clinic you can find it on elliot's twitter or just email him and he'll
send you a free copy he is very uh generous in that way let's say without further ado here's my
conversation with elliot rosenstock i think i'm still getting my head around some of the rossens
talking concepts you know i'm i'm right like like for example how do you define or how do you
describe your concept of the ego yeah a part of me went into heidegger i was thinking of is this are
you talking about something like the heideggerian design uh i appreciate you making the effort because
to be honest a lot of these are technical manuals for myself really so in terms of like i really
want to get into the true process of self-interest and it's very common for people to pick up my books
and say like what the f are you talking about even sadler said sadler said you know on the first time
through i didn't get it but it really needs us and sadler's like a uber genius who's like a expert on
hegel and stoicism so like if he's having to read it twice and alfie bound who's written on hegel
and jokes and he said like like i know you know what you're doing but i don't know what you're doing
kind of thing yeah yeah so like i appreciate you making i would love it if people could understand
my system a little better and i i have found it historically difficult for people to pick up my
system and start um using it so i appreciate you making the effort because it sounds like you're
making the effort to like really get it so no thanks thanks i mean mate like i'm nowhere close to
what you'd call an expert in any of these fields i'm just a neophyte but i think one thing i do enjoy
is i i certainly got it especially from the ego book that you could see that you're really writing
it for yourself uh and for me and i personally i think that's the best kind of writing i enjoy like i
i think that's kind of why i even enjoy more uh you know kind of philosophers over the more the
analytic types even though my i come from more for like an analytic philosophy background because for
for them i think they've sort of already got it figured out and they they want to express it into
to a to a reader whereas i write of the kind of philosophers for them it's like an ongoing process
uh maybe right yeah but i feel like they're trying to figure it out as they write it too
yeah so this was the ego book was a result of like a 10-year process or like a very kind of long
process of studying altruism actually and right when i started studying altruism i immediately got
into these weird self-interest types which is like there's group altruism kin altruism uh reciprocal
altruism and i did some studies about reciprocal altruism about how you'd think this would
work but people seem to want to not get things back so like for for instance if i was to say hey
hey mate uh i'll come over and um or could you come and help me put my car together versus like
uh versus that might be more appealing than could you come over and help me put my car together then
i'll go over and fix your bike if it breaks down like for some reason this is less appealing to people
even though concretely you will be getting my services as a bike repair person and it's an
exchange but people would rather do something for nothing so this was like the first kind of thing
that i said that's kind of weird like so there's this problem with game theory which is game theory
says what's the most rational you know yeah rational agents but as as it kind of turns out in vivo um there's
different processes going on and you could say these processes are broadly psychoanalytic in character
and that self-interest really you know has to go into feeling and intuition and that's why the book
starts with like dreams as the most reflexive intuitive core so you can take that and kind of
see this example of uh you know group altruism or kin altruism like i will do this because
you're a part of my friend group or a professional group or a family right um that is more powerful
than i will do it because i will get something concretely in return um so this is why like
self-interest like in terms of ego um i think is worth thinking of broader than kind of what's your
what's what color is your parachute what what's your uh you know myers-briggs what's your attachment
style all this kind of no really and you know there's a problem broadly with psychology that
there's a lot of categorical knowledge in psychology that works as this kind of like answer
yeah um or you it's funny if you watch hannibal they say and then they like they're trying to figure
it out and then they say and that means he's a pure psychopath like like why is that the answer
it's like the man's murdering he's doing this and then it's like ultimately there's this psychological
category as if that says something but i think there's not there's not a kind of movement of
psychology into this basic kind of process philosophy starting with like heraclitus like in the most basic
sense process um and moving into like hegel which is static nothingness process right um so it makes
sense because i mean i'm a i'm a baby hegelian i'm still figuring out hegel myself but one way i i see
the dialectic is that it's a movement it's not you know it's like it's not like a which is why you can't
formalize it the hegelian dialectic for instance and right and one thing you you you know you hit
the nail on the head there this kind of categorizing and and creating all these taxonomies or whatever
you may call them they they do like okay explain he's a sociopath or like i don't know what other
stuff in the mysbriggs uh introvert extrovert all these things you come up you're an entp that's my
myersberg's entp i don't even know that explains it i'm a leo is it a coincidence are leo's entps
i'm a senator i don't know what that is my dad's a sagittarius there you go it's all lining up it's
all lining up yeah there we go bro but you can but you can see how you can take these universal
categories some universal categories have stronger foundation and i would argue that um categories like
ego for instance which still like i further define but also something i don't further
define that i kind of take almost like directly as condensation hey everyone editor rahul here while
i was editing the podcast i did realize that elliot used this term condensation quite a lot in our
conversation and so i thought it would make sense to have a pithy definition of what this term or this
concept condensation means so at least what elliot means by it when he uses the term and so i messaged
him and i asked for a definition and here's what he replied back with elliot said condensation in dreams
is the dream object's property of being motivated by past experiences wishes anxieties and understanding
of the future or worries all at the same time it is the essence of surrealism's motto more reality and
the creation isn't always intelligible right away you can analyze it or you can extend the dream
alrighty end of the podcast although i don't talk a lot in the book but a lot of this is based off of
um the psychoanalytic concept of condensation which is to say i act with more purposes than i can
understand so this is also kind of antithetical to like rational agents i'm acting for this purpose
does it accomplish this person purpose or the scientific method here's my hypothesis i test it
and so so and not a lot of i would say thought has got gone into the process of you know how we actually
are which is to say we multiple motives right there's lots of theories of multiplicity yeah yeah
yeah but like split subjects but it where's the split because like the split is in essence right this
it's not actually this is the lesson of being which is to say like what do you mean by split is an essence
split is an essence so you have so for instance i'm essence okay so so like for instance i'm speaking
to you um there if i logically analyze my motives i could see a variety of oh i identify as a therapist
or i'm being interviewed this is kind of good oh it's an interpersonal connection which is like
kind of enjoyable uh it's kind of schedules my day oh i can say to my wife oh i got a podcast so like
uh you know various kind of like that once i go into that it's like you can split it so that's a
split so also conscious unconscious there's motives i don't know right um but it's not split in the realm
of being i would argue which is to say i am a unit a singular kind of biological unit contained um i'm a
and my actual actions is you could say but it's unmediated condensation which is to say i'm simply
doing the thing i'm doing right so that's not split it's not split until i do this reflection
yeah yeah i mean in in a brilliant conversation you had with uh cadet last on his podcast uh you
know i i cadets like a mentor of mine now i think i've learned so much from him and you said something
that you're more focused on this question of life and and that real life deeply so look we i was i
was gonna get to this in the latter part but here we are we are talking about it right now so
in fact i don't know if this is connected to this this idea of of split or the the the the living
essence not not being split but what do you mean by your that you're more interested in this
philosophy of life as such so you know after we cut out because cadel's a really nice guy
so after we stop recording cadel goes you know maybe life is a spurious infinity which would have
been a good but then we do because you know hegel's all about if it's a spurious infinity you drop the
category and and start thinking with a different category right um but for life is not a spurious
infinity i would say because for instance it is worth thinking of myself as this like me as a
singular unit of self-interest that i describe is in fact the tendency of life and if you don't have
that you don't i would argue you don't have being so hegel's all about you know if you have a category
or a concept without being or essence you kind of have this empty concept right um so i would argue
that if you if you kind of stick with you start if you start with essence like for instance a
scientific question is like this is already an essence um like a split i would argue is already
an essence if you don't start with i would say the freudian category of condensed life which is to say
life you can argue is split but i would say it's simply like condensed um that it's not a spurious
infinity in fact it's the foundation to unfold the concept so still sticking with hegel's mess mess
method his messy method uh being essence concept i think this is a good idea but the problem is
along these lines what you consider spurious and not spurious uh is really a matter it can be a matter
of opinion and certainly like hegel has his own opinions about you know ergo british parliamentary
is not rational prussian monarchy is rational yeah but like obviously you can just reflect on this
concept on its own and say like well monarchy has these negative tendencies democracy has these negative
tendencies i'd rather have this parliamentary system even and this kind of can go wrong so like
you can like ultimately the concepts developed rely on um you know where you're starting from what
essence is you're taking so when i i for instance do groups i like i'm very open to this process in
people which is to say like i do five dream analysis groups thanks to thanks to the glory of platform
capitalism um no random people they sign up and then they they can they can join like a dream dream
group i do yeah wow this is you called it they called it uh do dash therapy right that yeah that's
what yeah door when i was talking about doug like a few i was like i'm a doordash yeah yeah i had a good
love yeah but yeah but like some people go like wow i can't believe this platform has it it's like well
it wouldn't have it unless i was you know doing it but but i would like more people to get this like
you know deeper skill so like in these groups um the idea is dreams themselves are being so the dream
the idea of a dream is it has condensed experiences wishes anxieties that what's present in now
problem solving for the future but also anxieties about the future so it's it's kind of like indeterminate
if it's if it's uh an anxiety or if it's a fact and all this presents itself in the dream and you
create this right away and you don't know what it means so which this is to say your subjectivity is
understanding things faster than your psyche consciously reflects on it and this is why people
describe it as a split you know like there's the but in reality the split only happens um i forgot
oh it's embarrassing i'm forgetting the kantian word a posteriori there it is after you yeah after
yeah yeah after you reflect on it so before you reflect there is no split no i really yeah there's
no pre-hawk split in some sense yeah yeah there's there's no pre-hawk to uh or whatever it's only
that was a good one i saw um i saw i every time i see this hawk now i'm always like i saw i saw this
thing i took i was like i can't post that but i was like yeah it was like a bed and breakfast it
was called like the hawk i was like i forget what it's called fully but i'm just like uh anyway yeah
um so but the split only happens after i reflect and say oh i'm making two categories now yeah conscious
unconscious which i do i've never thought of it that way i i think in in that sense i still do think
in some essentialist sense where for me that the split is just like an ontological split um and i mean
would you still say it's in some sense ontological or are you saying the split it's an ontological
question and i mean i would say contemporary theory is theory of the split theory of lack
theory of gap this kind of like existentialist negation right absolute recoil like zizek absolute
this net the negativity is like in the is the main kind of thing and i really like i think to do a
basic kind of philosophical project is maybe like out of time a little bit which is to say like
to have a basic core ontological idea that isn't immediately critical theory is like not really in
fashion right now um but that is kind of what this is starting from which is there's nothing you could
say this is not about critical theory right away this is about ontology and epistemology right away so
there's no political message in the core versus you i would say with zizek or zupancic um or you know
slovenian school or modern critical theory within the ontology as a politic and they would you know they
would say like well elliot isn't your doesn't your i would argue like um insofar as like all thoughts
or you can orient yourself towards politics or philosophy but i would say like you are going to
miss out on the nature of life like the category of life if you don't understand that there isn't this
condensation uh immediacy process that has a rationality you can take essences you develop concepts
but concepts i also like i i also think of concepts as smaller than being like as well which is to say
like we develop concepts but ultimately the concept we develop so where's where's the real split i would
say real splits are concepts we develop do not in in capture the absolute hyper state i'm talking about
right so like we'll get there sorry i interrupted yeah no that's all right so like this is like this
is the thing like this absolute hyper state object of all of our human mode like thinking in this big
scale it's like what how can i describe the totality of human efforts and motives in the actual risk it's
like i i can call this absolute hyper state and ultimately um i'm a subsection of that there's always
going to be outside the concepts i develop are within it they have a certain amount of force and
i feel like i'm very i have a very humble ontology right i have a my ontology is a bit more humble
which is to say like i'm not like considering i'm like ergo i'm the revolutionary subject ergo these
guys are the revolution it's like well let's look at the force of your works in your speech what does
it do what does it not do how does it how does it interact with what already is and what could be and
this kind of thing so it is i think it is like a properly philosophical method it's a it has some
concrete benefits i would say also kind of in terms of practice of psychotherapy which is to say
psychotherapy has to work for all peoples really um and i would say this process does in so far as the
self-interest concept um and kind of allowing people the room to develop concepts uh and to
understand their world in this kind of way which is to say the hyperstate right which is to say people
have a hyperstate we have our individual ones we have group ones we make together there's social
structure hyperstate uh you know uh historical like hyper like in terms of what you decide to
essentialize right which is to say as soon as you reflect you're creating an essence um you're not
you don't have unmediated being except at your very core there's kind of the unmediated so yeah so
this is this is this is like that's a broad outline of like the ontology if you're going to talk about
like what how what do i think the world consists of like at its core right sorry i think i gotta
interrupt you there you said you don't have an do you say unmediated or mediated because hegel's
whole point is that you can't have an unmediated experience right it there's there has to always be
a mediation you know like for example in sense certainty right so is your point that there can be
an unmediated being or did i miss miss hear you there i would argue there is there is a kind of
unmediated being in the form of life in the form of condensation that's what i was thinking yeah yeah
great when we do reflect i think hegel has a point in so far as like our process of reflection you could
possibly call that in a centralizing in any particular moment but i am arguing that there is a kind of core
uh unmediated process and the character of the unmediated process in so far as like it's not
unmediated in so far as like it doesn't go through our senses but we can use the concept of unmediated
to say it's so reflexive right so for instance like i have a dream i create a dream
uh i'm equating this with unmediated being right so i'm equating this with
pre-reflection pre-taking the essence of it and pre-concept and the reason i'm using the word
unmediated is to kind of draw this back to uh this kind of core material of life so i can see in maybe
a technical sense in so far as like but isn't but isn't it going through your psyche isn't it going
through there is like a category of your like meat but i think it goes back to the meat right okay okay
i'm so i've got a question uh i'm in fact i didn't tell you this but i'm i'm writing a small review of
your book right now i'm gonna like break down your concepts you know in like very in like a nerdy
definition kind of way uh so one thing i want to ask you is this elliot is that is is this life the
philosophy of life you speak of kind of like this nietzschean way of exist existence you know yeah i'm so glad
you asked that no definitely not nietzsche is a moral philosopher at his core he has idea yeah
please elaborate yeah yeah definitely not um nietzsche has this idea that certain concepts like
christianity uh like socialism are intrinsically negations of life right so this is this is a
different idea of life so like the idea is like uh this has been developed but he's so he's he even
calls himself a psychologist in places he says which and this is why he's saying well you're
developing these concepts out of resentment and in fact even you know even in the ancient world
philosophy is developed out of resentment and a lack of power ergo but then the next statement is ergo
they're bad and the warrior is good but tell me why is the warrior simply good uh why why is a guy
who doesn't do philosophy and kills people with the sword better than a philosopher i would say in a
basic sense that's stupid like like i don't i don't believe that i think if nisha was getting like
sliced by this guy i don't think like this is essentially good because it's strong right it has a
certainty so so like force he has a force of an idea like say that warrior has i represent sparta
you know insofar as i act i act with the spartans and i do that but that's like also i kind of put it
into equivalence with i would say christianity is a cause i'm a priest i'm trying to spread like i don't
i don't judge like ontologically and this is kind of why it's um like a therapy process which is to say
this is an interest it's a cause right so like ultimately following the essences from like the
dream like you know you could describe people's different motives like oh he's doing this because
he was beaten as a child as a spartan like for instance you could say well it's not really simply
unmediated right he he had these core conditions but this is why it's like a bit of an idealist philosophy
which is to say like i put less emphasis on this sort of cause which is to say like what is the
root cause this can this is part of the hyper state you could say but ultimately um insofar as somebody
acts with the kind of motive of a basic like i'm expanding sparta i'm expanding my person even if
he has some traumatic reasons it's like maybe that's less important than what he's actually doing
doing right um and you can you can measure your own self say if i'm a slave in sparta like i'm gonna
i'm gonna be like ah well you know he was beaten and traumatized and this is the tendency of psychology
he's traumatized you know he was kind of like you know made a child soldier uh you know you can all
that's true but another way to look at that is hmm he is the spartan upper class he is uh he can beat
me if he wants to does he does he join with the oh he seems to join with those guys and beats that guy
so he's part of this interpersonal network he's part of this cause right um and maybe that's more
important so i think there is this kind of also insofar as bringing psychology into the actual force
of like action right so i think like this is like i think this is necessary which is to say to push
psychology from a kind of like categorical understanding from a history history is simply
the answer to into the actual right um so i would say this you know sometimes they try to do this in
cognitive therapy oh you know cognitive therapy we're gonna forget about the past what are your
thoughts i'm thinking this what are your actions what are your but but this doesn't really say enough
right oh how do you feel i feel kind of stressed and they it still kind of ultimately relies on these
categorical trauma kind of stuff but it doesn't really it doesn't ever get to the point where it
conceptually understands what's happening so like i kind of i'm kind of writing a book now uh which is
this is which is titled hyper psychology yeah i'm aware and um yeah this is the big project right oh yeah
you watch the cadela thing so hyper psychology and like the idea is i say hyper psychology only
really to say psychology which is to say like what is psychology what should psychology consist of
like it should consist of these actual forces i can conceptualize the present i can understand the
forces of the present i can understand the forces of the past and i can understand forces in the future
in a more actual way so the idea is we are getting to like a deep i i am like positing this is like a
deeper rational way to understand uh the world so it's not simply speculative like like the highest
format is the highest form of being art is the highest form of being class war right i mean is the highest
form of being uh geist or is it your family is that the highest form of being right um and i'm ultimately
arguing if you want to understand why you think any of those you should start you can you should start
from the dream really in terms of the multiple motives which i am calling unmediated right
in so far as it's it's it's it's probably better to say pre-mediated i see because like your pre-reflective
pre-mediated i see yeah it might might even be able to say pre because i would say the prime mediation
is the essentializing yeah is this essentializing and actualness because this is like you know the ego
the idea is the ego takes these different forms it can't be captured by a personality type or a
category it takes the it ultimately takes the form of actual force right it in ego this is why in the
book it's like ego has exact math right so this is to say like ego is not my concept ego is like there's
a kind of exact math of the ego hypothetically that can be rationally understood um that's that is kind
of like there's there's this core idea there so i think like maybe i think nominally more than hegel
which is to say like there is like a truth of the thing that maybe i can't get to fully the truth
of the thing this is like almost kantian style thought of being but yeah um but there is like
this is to say like there is i mean this is what schopenhauer made fun of hegel for which is like
schopenhauer says what about this scientific thing and hegel would like not know and schopenhauer would
just kind of like nay nay people don't say nay nay they would just like nay nay on him be like you
don't know anything about science you've picked up maybe something about math but um so this is to say
there is kind of a science of being right there is a kind of being that we're not necessarily in touch
with and so like i could say if i could hypothetically have a supercomputer attached to me
that followed every single motive and calculated every action via my kind of categories of cause and
like all this kind of stuff um maybe we could get something close to like a mathematical calculation
of different categories and how much force this but i i really think like that would be an impossible
task to like parse out things in this different way in terms of like how much is it working towards
how much are you influenced by this cause in the world like how much are you speaking about this
particular cause in the world so anyway so for this for this theory of yours again sorry naive question
how do you account the freudian death drive right so this is a concept so first of all yeah freudian
freudian death drive is a historically developed concept for sure yeah okay yeah i would say
the concept of death drive i equate towards the concept of splitting more so okay different people
different people understand or not splitting i would say disarticulation so if you go to the if you go to
the elements of self-interest right the opposite eros so we we should talk eros as well as death drive
right because their their concepts those are like these two primary drives of freud so eros has the
oceanic quality right and he writes a lot a lot of things have an appeal because of the oceanic quality
uh and a lot of times concepts can work like this so concepts take self other like for instance we
are two different people right i have a life you have a life but by the concept of psychology we're
unmediated that isn't that interesting so this is like this is the oceanic effect of uh you know not
not not coming on you but like of oceanic effect of arrows right in a broad sense but it's not
necessarily like erotic arrows but unification so i think there is something beyond unfortunately
you're married mate so it's not gonna work unfortunately no but this is like why i don't
think it's necessarily sex and death because it's like there are different kind of unifications possible
um so alternatively say um say you you create rahul pun publishing i said punishing rahul punish how
publishing exactly and say like oh wow like these contracts you're offering or this kind of things i
don't know i don't like uh i don't like uh this sort of like controversy i don't like how i like uh so
they want to unify via the rahul publishing that will be our unifying i was like and it's called
after you and i you know i don't know um so then for instance death drive is like i want out right so
like that means so i would say like exit and i think this like works with like contemporary theories of
exit like for instance nick land very much about exit theory yeah uh modern modern kind of libertarian
broadly libertarian theories i think they're totally necessary to understand the ontology of today
in terms of like is there a tendency towards more and more and more little realms this is
like a little realm like how do we have this little realm through technology through very specific
concepts so i think we need to understand that in a broad ontological sense uh nick land and this kind
of type of right-wing thinker they have something to say about um meltdown like things are melting
like like we're not going to a central psych authority to like to make this little kind of realm
yeah jack says we're all perverts horny for the apocalypse in the perverts horny for the apocalypse
but but it's not it's not that that sounds good but that's not true really like um oh i think i think
he was making more critique of like our current zeitgeist yeah yeah it's like it's like a metaphor
but like like but this is but is it like does it is that ontologically true like yeah this is like
and i think this is the task of philosophy which is like oh well you know he's saying something
he's myth but this is like a mythology you speak of me in this yeah yeah in ego and the happy yeah yeah
so he's like saying something he's saying this as relates to the broad socialist cause or progressive
cause but it's not ontologically true oh certainly in fact i think like about some progressive or like
some woke people or whoever that you know he's quite critical of um but but he didn't i don't
think he was making that statement in an ontological sense i think you're right there um and then i've
got i've got heaps of questions mate in fact i i don't think we can we can contain it all into one
conversation if i'm being honest uh however if you don't mind given we can't we can't really avoid
this because the topic is itself is about life as you said yeah uh i'm curious you know i
not particularly in this podcast but through you know my personal connections friendships
whatever the case may be i know people who are psychotherapists i know people who are counselors
people who work in mental health uh but none of them have ever been interested in
hegel and philosophy and you know sartre or nietzsche you notice that yeah or even freud for that matter
you know like i mean even freud they know who he is but they think he's just like this weird dude
who talks sleeping with your mother so i mean i'll i'll i'll ask you in two ways this question a
bipartite manner let's say um firstly how is it that your your your vocation or if i could call it that
is you're a psychotherapist but how is it that you try to incorporate so much of philosophy into your work
and you write books on philosophy and you're trying to create this uh you're trying to create
hyper psychology as you call it and not to be a narcissist but to be but um it's like asking a
local chess club it's like right so all these people are like 1400 chess players why are you a
master level chess player it's like i don't know mate i study more that's exactly what i mean in fact
you knew what i knew better you knew my question more than you but they're not necessarily worse
for people like like they can help people but like in terms my question in terms of like
my question was more as in why do you choose why do you choose to bring in freud and hagel
into your work as a psychotherapist i would say like wouldn't it be nice
if psychology represented in an absolute sense both true things and totally the self-interest
of the client showing up i think this is like a powerful thing if you can make it
right alternatively psychology can be
broadly a set of tools right which there's no reflection on the tools there's no kind of
dialectical understanding of the tools they're just these are the tools that you will use
these are the things you can have you can have anxiety you can have depressed mood you can have
an attachment you can have a relationship conflict and we're going to use these tools
and we're going to reduce a symptom so this is broadly the method of public mental health
yeah right you can see why that's very favorable for insurance people who the the kind of code in
california is you have to describe what you're doing in a way that people who don't understand psychology
know what you're doing um which is fine but ultimately you the the kind of nuts and bolts of the thing
should be deeper than that like uh so i think i took it upon myself kind of finding this lack
in in terms of for myself it was not enough to say like um i'm feeling six sad okay now i can
meditate how sad do you feel now i guess like four sad oh you're cured great um so this is like psychology
is it can be totalitarian and i just want it to reach its true totalitarian potential but also
lacking totalitarianism like we so it should cover everything right psychology should cover the
totality of your life in some way right um but also there's this kind of contradiction which is if
it's covering the totality of your life it should go beyond the subject of psychology which is to say
it should go into all concepts really um in all kind of important essential phenomenons and it should
not psychologize necessarily everything which is to say bring it back into one of these kind of core
categories of diagnosis of empirical measure of sad points or anxiety points right um there should be
a rational development of these concepts and this is not always easily expressed by a public mental
health authority in fact i would argue it probably cannot be expressed by it so when you when you learn
psychology you learn psychopathology the categories of diagnosis you learn different methods like
dialectical behavioral therapy and i love how marshall linehan when lecturing about dialectics just
casually says and the funny thing is i call that i didn't even know what it was and everyone's like
i was like do you realize that's really bad mate no no no one cares because america no one gives a
shit uh they're like oh no it works and you're like well-renowned so that's what matters you're famous
martha no uh no but dialectical behavioral therapy is like a specific set of tools and so on but it doesn't
necessarily give people the ability to think and i really want to help people think and i want to do
this without imposing my ideology on them as best as i can so that's why my first book is about how can i negate
my ideology so this is very different than like a zizakian perspective or a critical like how do i really work from the
interiority of the other life form right you could say as best as i can even though i'm you could say
split although in the realm of being we are not split you're there i'm like in a big enough sense we're
not split or so on um uh but like how do i if i'm essentializing and making this method this is where the
split develops which is like there is an intrinsic power structure i have to use my power for the
other person how do i yeah and how do how do i do this and what kind of further is developed in the
ego and hyper state book is a further expanding of what self-interest is in general which kind of helps
you do that thing in the first book which highlights the necessity of this uh you could say power dynamic
how does that how and i think this is why it's intrinsically a left-wing project because it it is
like how does the person in power not abuse their power that's not like the project of the right which
is like here are why the hierarchies are just and i could i could argue that i could say oh look at all
this stuff i've done i'm a really you know i have all the knowledge and you don't and blah blah but this
is like the opposite of what power should do right so i ultimately think right-wing ontology um is bad
for you like emotionally right not not not even talking about like maybe some countries you know
it will help this or that or whatever i would say broadly speaking to think in this kind of
hierarchical power way i is like destructive and i and i think that's because you can go
all the way to hegel in terms of mutual recognition like should you use your power to uplift other
people firstly should you use your should you know the limits of your power right which is i know about
psychology and then i could reach this cause and then i don't know about like i don't for instance
putting a podcast together like that has its own set of things and i i'm very not good at organizing that
as you saw try it like you call you're like elliot let's do the podcast oh i'm at the gym
so that's like its own that's its own thing right so that's a limit of my ability right um so power
should know what it's good at it should use it to uplift others it and it should know its limit and
this is like not i don't see this in the right so much i think nick land tries to do something like this
sometimes but other times he doesn't like other times he says power essentially better people kill
you know the yeah it's very it's very it's very aristotelian right-wing ontology aristotle is
probably like a modern right test where everyone's got their place within the within the hierarchy right
and then i prefer more the platonic platonic way i think i want to make a few few comments on what
you said about yes psychology um in fact in fact i completely agree because you know it's it's funny
you know we kind of caricature of psychoanalysis one could be oh we have an unconscious so we have
all these desires and we do things unknowingly uh we do self-destructive things whatever the case may be
but what what i find interesting is the more i've read psychoanalysis you know freud or lacon
you know in it's it really is a project that comes out of the enlightenment as in it really does
respect people as being rational agents as being rational beings who can think who can partake uh
partake in life as you say whereas some whereas for example i again some more more cognitive scientific
way of thinking about you know subjectivity it it completely ignores this idea of life it says like okay
humans we're driven by uh i don't know this motivation this incentive and a leads to b so the kind of
what you describe the game theoretic way and i do i do like that you're trying to in some sense
in a very uh audacious way uh reinvent psychology to its to its essence uh in in many ways um so
uh yeah uh where where i was going with that was in fact to ask you this question about this book
jack in the clinic now unfortunately for some reason i think i was more drawn towards your second book
so i read this carefully than jack in the clinic um yeah i i don't blame you because like i feel like
jack in the clinic was a bit of a hysteric book like i was like there's something wrong with the field of
psychology um i'm gonna broadly like say like all the things that are wrong with it this is like a
kind of more it was regardless it was regardless of very enjoyable read i think this is a stupid
reason but one reason i read this small was because i had the physical copy and i could read it wherever
whereas just in the clinic i had a pdf so it was like a dumb it was right but like kill the utilitarian you
know that kind of thing but uh okay uh elliot again these are gonna be i'm gonna probably be the
hysteric here and so forgive me um uh if you're talking to let's say um you you use this some green
green people uh you know people who have new new people people who show up and say i have some problems
i've entered the platform capitalism because they have the most ads and now i'm talking to uh elliot
rosenstock in a group yeah yeah so assume i'm one of these green people and and i mean i want to i
want you to use the chicken psychoanalytic or psychotherapy therapeutic method to to
kind of good fix me i mean that ironically of course so how how yeah what what is what are you trying
to do by bringing zizek into the clinic zizek which is again this is an interesting code element at this
point too where uh zizek took the clinic so lacanian psychoanalysis to theory and politics and you know
sociology and whatnot but you're in the opposite and bringing his philosophy back into the clinic and yeah
it's not it's not what lacan's trying to do so it's like the problem is like ultimately the idea is
what is the ideological critique so you bring zizek into the clinic to critique the intrinsic ideology
present in modern psychology right perfect and all yeah so like this appears as an objective ontological
system like oh do i have the adhd do i have the anxiety why is this the category of life
i was like go back to like maybe go back to like let's go back to 600 to 800 a.d let's look at what
the jewish christian and islamic communities were drawing they drew they drew some people and they
have they mark the people and they say this is your this and like why don't we use that generic system
versus and there's an anthropological idea i've only recently started studying with some um better
educated uh people in anthropology um why don't we use ancient generics so there's a there's a concept
of a generic which is to say i draw a body right i draw a body and i attach a bunch of concepts to the
body all right and i say people basically have this kind of system and that's that's a person and if
you're doing and religions can do this ah here you're doing this and that's what a person consists of so
in a hegelian sense what and a ideological critique we're taking kind of psychology's diagnostic system as a
generic um it has kind of the appearance of medicine but it's not it's not the same thing i mean if
people hallucinate you might say well what about people who hallucinate it's like yeah there there
are people who hallucinate and not and that's kind of rare and so there's schizoaffective disorder
schizophrenia uh delusional disorder right and this kind of thing um but another way to say is they
hallucinate they take a pill and it drops their dopamine and they stop hallucinating like at what
point do you need the generic um there i think it's it's less it's less kind of solid than people make
it out to be and people know this all the professionals know this and they say this they
say well this is broadly helping us figure out some psychological treatment models so like you know
you you want to like focus on this or that but ultimately i would argue like psychology has the
capacity to have you relate to your unmediated or pre-mediated intuition or your psyche or your
subjectivity uh and ultimately this is more universal which is to say bringing your rational
capacity in conversation with not just your most impulsive self but there's a there's an even more
impulsive self than your most impulsive self um and that is your dream self when you dream you're creating
a whole a deep world of con concepts uh condensed synthesized right this is what this is that word
really it really is synthesized it's not dialectically split but it's really you could say pre-mediated
synthesis of uh being right so this is more even this is more impulsive than your most impulsive kind of
self and ultimately how do you bring your essentializing process and development of your decision making in
conversation with this um and you know some basic kind of categories of life which are like interpersonal
relationships telos cause right um and this kind of thing yeah that's that's kind of what i'm trying
to develop as like when people get this people get this they go to therapy and they get this you know
first of all all this this stuff can match up quite easily which is to say like oh yeah i have this
symptom and it reduce like you can that's all still there like we don't have to throw that away
like we can still do symptom reduction and so on but there's a kind of like qualitative potential
about how to do this which ultimately is not expressible by insurance or even kind of medical
speak it is it needs philosophy right we have to talk philosophically uh in order to you could say
deliver the highest quality psychology which is to say thinking and feeling itself and being it's and
acting yeah i love that i love that i mean this is in fact that that last bit you just mentioned that that
deeply resonates with me um and it's funny you say i spoke to a psychoanalyst she's a well she's a
psychotherapist but also psychoanalyst uh based in perth in australia and she essentially made the same
point um she said like she um she doesn't really even engage much in theory like the way you do she's
very much you know sticks to like home freud the the praxis than the theory and the whole point was uh yeah a lot
of people that come to her they they come as a sort of a last resort where yeah they know they've got
some anxiety or they know they've got this or that but they're like yeah i know it but i'm still doing
it i'm still i'm still abusing alcohol i'm addicted to pornography or sex so i'm still uh having i'm still
suffering as an individual even though i i've i've put myself into this category i'm like okay i've got i've
got adhd but that doesn't really help anything there's no there's no cure in in that sense um and
then and they come into psychoanalysis and go through that process and sometimes it takes years
yeah well i mean at least psychoanalysis is making the space for this like it's it's like psychoanalysis
laid the foundation to like let people free associate to interpret dreams and things like this i'm not sure
if she does interpreting dreams maybe she does if she's doing psychoanalysis yeah i'm not sure i mean
i haven't spoken to her about a year so but she wrote a beautiful essay uh on love which i kind of
want to talk to you about too because you do mention friendship in this book however just just on this
elliot and i think this is more for the listener so i hope you're not gonna like cringe inside i'm just
gonna read out this excerpt from your book from just on page itself from jerk in the clinic because i
think i think this little excerpt just does capture the spirit of the book you say the new vanishing
point is this a psycho-educated person with high insight into their own functioning with an algorithmic
response process with which to respond to events on an individual microscopic as well as a systemic
level yeah so yeah please elaborate on that statement yeah so aesthetically i would say maybe that's not
the best way to put it but but nonetheless it's like it's once you say algorithmic like this kind of
thing what it means like is like how do you how do you respond and how do you kind of understand
yourself when i was kind of when i was writing that i was thinking about this intuition level
a lot or zizek in the clinic this kind of first moment right um which is to say what is psychotherapy
doing it's kind of working directly on this first moment so before i kind of an ego in the hyperstate
described well what is in that first moment this is like well you're you're being informed you're
getting psycho education you're you're changing your relationship to your intuition reflexes in this
first moment um so the algorithmic when you say algorithmic aesthetically this is like me in my 20s
and so on but like um that what that really means is your intuitive reflex in terms of this intuitive
reflexive first moment right it will change like i would even say like it all the way to like ultimately
if you really it'll change your dreams right like all the way down like like to say like
like this process of psychotherapy as you're as you're speaking and as you're kind of doing things
with people and as you're rationally kind of understanding it will change your unconscious
so like i feel like that's a that's awesome so that's true that's kind of fun algorithmic but let's
just say let's just say because this process has the capacity to introduce your rationality
to your kind of most impulsive self or your psyche like ultimately your you are your education is
getting in there in terms of understanding is getting this is why psychology is totalitarian
um because it really goes to like the core of your thought in understanding but i'm trying to say like
people have once you're there you do have the freedom ideally to develop the concepts that you
are already uh developing but let's say like someone comes in and they're like a crypto libertarian and
they say like uh not like a secret libertarian but like a crypto bro like libertarian crypto libertarian um
and they're like well elliot you know like i'm really trying to make it in a crypto uh currency and uh this
is kind of what's happening and you know this is the fluctuations and these are the difficulties and
uh you know i might start talking about it well you know is this how is this working for you it's
like yeah you know it's tough for me it's maybe i'm happy maybe it's not working for me maybe it is
working for me i'm certainly like uh you know in this process of this and might even psychoeducation
might say something like there's a couple ways to look at this there's like the addictive property
of technology itself and gambling then there's the cutting edge kind of future in terms of like this
is cryptocurrency could be a new digital currency there's all this kind of stuff so uh and maybe you
can tell me more about why you're in cryptocurrency and there's a moment where it'd be like well i really
believe in it or like i don't know why i'm in it actually or like this kind of so there is like
this measuring and you kind of have to bring in um arguments for and against and ultimately your
concepts are somewhat ideological but the idea is like you're trying to you're trying to do this with
the most kind of freedom uh existential freedom for the person to kind of work through it themselves
um and sometimes they'll fall and make a change other times they maybe will reinforce or for instance
like um people that are very organized at work like extremely organized and they're having some trouble
because they're they're so obsessed with organization maybe the oc yeah that's you maybe they're maybe they're
ocd maybe they're this kind of thing right uh so this is like one way to think of it um
but but it's like would their treatment consist of like saying you're you're thinking about these
things but really you shouldn't so this is like an idiot ideological which is to say like
ah this is a symptom maybe you should get rid of this or actually there's some positives to being organized
yeah i'm just gonna mention i'm glad you brought that up because for me i know i maybe they'd call
me ocd but i've i never really worried cared about that i was like yeah i'm ocd because for me it's at
a very practical level i realized that being ocd makes my life better like as an it it in the sense that
i what i find is i'd suffer more if i was you know in complete chaos and just not organized and shabby and
and and and like a lot about things and and at least for me subjectively i i kind of i guess i've
i've embraced the symptom you know well so so like i don't know but yeah wouldn't it be weird for me who
just was like oh shit i got an interview to be like then come into a therapy session with you and
then say you know you're too organized like this is this is what psychology has the potential to do
right rather than kind of put it into the process of the actual which is to say like how is this working
in your life what are the stressors right how is this not work so back to self-interest like
is can i can i ask you raul just not to therapize you but just one question which is like are there
any downsides to being really organized uh yes i think i don't deal well with uncertainty but then
the way i deal with uncertainty or like the stress from uncertainty is through like physical pursuits
like i mean if i'm stressed i'll go like run a marathon or something on the day just by myself and i find
physical uh relief that i don't know what you would call it that helps me deal with that but
i'd say that's one and the other probably would be yeah i can be like an bit of an annoying partner
or like an annoying friend because i won't think i'm like a fascist everything's in point order time
discipline uh so i think those two so those are two specific so you have yourself stated the downsides
versus me picking them from a symptom list so you said the downsides are uncertainty is difficult and
on an interpersonal level i want to control other people's actions and it causes conflict sometimes
sometimes so i mean these are things that can be worked concretely through through a process and you
see how that's very different than saying you have ocd here's some benzos or something and that's where
it goes back to the idea of in psychoanalysis you know free association there's a there's a there's a
there's a fundamental dignity to that isn't it you say you're a you're a human being you respect the
human being for who they am as a dignity that you can work through this yeah i i i do resonate with
that in fact i i gotta say this too uh elliot one thing i like about your writing
and your even your public work is there's no there's no like sentimental suffering as in
i find the people who go into like theory and philosophy they romanticize suffering a little
bit they like they they look they look at a happy person they're like oh so naively stupid you know
but for me something i i used to do that too sometimes but i've stopped doing that because i think
it's unhelpful i think there's something good about having a joyful person
i'm looking for my my witch i call it the philosopher's rune but maybe i've i've put it
away somewhere is it back there once is it back that way once one second one second i'm gonna grab
it yeah grab it you know what i'm not i'm not gonna i'm not gonna continue looking for it he says while
continuing to look for it whoa what what is it a book or uh it's a book so you this is a direct
response but i actually did some witchcraft uh where no way i'm so upset i can't find not not really
witchcraft but like yeah so i have a i that's so i it's always right there and i can't believe i think i i
cleaned i i cleaned it and i'll have to i'll have to sort it out but i have my um i have my slavoj zizek
signed copy of uh ayn rand's the fountainhead oh that's hilarious i love it
and when i handed it to him he said ah yes ayn ran the greatest so this is if you want to not
be sentimental if you want if you like the way unbalanced on the other side of no sentimentality
is ayn rand so ayn rand's really great for this speaking of egoism the history of egoism um one
thing that it's it's there's a dignity ayn rand's trying to make a dignity for people i would say she
ultimately fails but nonetheless she's trying to kind of create this dignified project of like
you have this ability um but i think it's she doesn't think structures very well like ultimately
like there is kind of a lack there but but one of her big points is uh this kind of impulse to like
pity or to like be sentimental uh it might it might not be simply a reflection of your deep moral
highness i think that is a kind of important kind of idea that this like that's like ah if i if i pity
other people this will like lead me to uh this will lead me to a deep knowledge well what about if you
like you said the word dignity what if you give the dignity to other people through understanding
that there are things that will benefit them they have the right to do things that are benefiting them
and then i would say like this is we're very different than ayn rand my version of self-interest
ayn rand's version of self-interest is that you have to understand capitalist moral philosophy to
then have self-interest really versus i'm saying i have a psychological egoism perspective which is
everyone is acting in their best self-interest all the time like you do this intuitively reflexively
this theory of the psyche says you can't reflect on how you're doing this um and ultimately this can
improve and in this sort of thing so but i but i do like in so far as ayn rand dedicated her life
to saying maybe there's something good beyond kind of like martyrdom and pitying right which is like
i'm sacrificing myself aren't i good like like if you want to let's let's see like how your sacrifice
will add up uh maybe it will be impactful or maybe people maybe like you'll do something and people like
like wow you traded you traded your life uh for this cause and let's see what your impact was
like is that did it help the cause like did maybe did it was it popular within the cause maybe like
you'll be a figurehead right so it's like is that enough for you so like this is not very sentimental
but also i'm not like ayn rand which is to say you you shouldn't do it i'm like well let's see that
let's see what you're doing exactly and that's because you're in what psychological aspect of it
yeah yeah psychological egoism and also developing the category of cause where you could say which
is similar to like telos or purpose right um yeah okay uh so ellie you did touch on when we started
talking uh earlier on the absolute hyperstate i had to reread that chapter a couple of times it was
it was a good chapter but yeah if you could just because because in some sense this book reads like
the phenomenology of spirit like it's it's it's a program it's a development into something right so
but uh yeah what's the absolute hyperstate and how does it differ from absolute knowing by hegel
yeah if something is if it's unmediated but also hyper mediated so this is like this is like the con
maybe there's a contradiction here because it's also the ontological substance the ego substance
of the totality of life efforts right um so for instance like i can rely on this
all right and the force of this is much larger than the force of me so for instance
i move to england right i don't know anything about england but they're interesting there's a train
system right there um there's a philosophy library right there um there's a football team i don't know
what i think about that football it's kind of interesting maybe there's a lot of people into football
that's cool there's i could play baseball if i want there's a kind so all this stuff is prior
this exists in the world and has a force right and then i could say like let's reorder society and
england's gonna be not patriotic or whatever and they're gonna cool their reactionary tendencies
and it's like well freud said oh i like england except you know despite their conservatism i like
england and so on um you could do that but for instance there is a kind of force of other people's
morals in the world like already like there's already the force of football there's already the force
of this kind of thing and i can put myself into kind of relation with the forces of my surroundings
so that to note so it's like i would say like it kind of has the effect of like like i'm stepping on
i'm stepping on this rock rather than sand and that's kind of like unmediated being but really
i'm stepping on the concrete efforts and ideas of the people like a large amount of people's efforts
all at once and kind of like i step on a rock right it's that and the idea is to show people that this
exists and this is like how the idea is concrete why is i say i like i say idealism because it's more
material than materialism right i don't say idealism because i because i'm sentimental i'm very not
sentimental like you like you kind of pointed out um you're not yeah yeah yeah yeah i think this is a
scientific mindset which is to say like this exists at a certain force level in the world also you
know working in kind of like south la working in like compton uh there was a guy really into proger
you like really into this right wing oh the dennis prig is oh okay yeah and for instance he says
he says you know have you heard of this guy dennis pretty he's like in his 50s have you heard of him
and i said oh like in my mind i'm like he's a wow you wow that's not good so not only so he ultimately
has to not just deal with like i'm not i have room for him but also he's like a therapy person so
there's like a limit to like um but ultimately his like ideas are a bit weak and not in touch
with something there they have a certain so there's me like i'm not like negating him or what i'm like
oh listen to him i'll respect him and i'm not going to call him like an idiot or something but however
the setting that he's in being in like south central los angeles black and hispanic population um
um if your source of knowledge is prager you you might come up against you could call some absolute
hyperstate issues which is to say like no one wants to maybe hear why there there are core ways that
south central kind of runs uh like certain ideas like for instance the nation of islam which my greatest
kind of excess not my wife is tired of me but like for instance of saying this but like i went to a
boxing match invited by like a lieutenant in the nation of islam and there was a big fight that broke
out because it was just like uh you know the big fight breaks out and all the big nation of islam
people are protecting me and ushering me out and i'm like wow how did i get to this point where nation
of islam people are physically protecting me from a fight and ushering me out of a boxing arena um
and you might say why do people not like the nation of islam oh aren't they anti-semitic in general oh
aren't there isn't their ontology of world off maybe but also they're a concrete force in an area
so if you're going to work with a community it's not really enough to say like nation of islam like
farrakhan is anti-semitic and uh this is it's like you're either going to help the community or you're
not right so like so like you can't just like ideologically like like pwn like oh you you know
you think this or this or like a for instance dr sebi is really popular uh what and there's a common
idea he was killed for his nutrition ideas because he was so nutritious the people didn't
want you to be that this is like a common idea um like dr sebi he was so nutritious and like would it
really help to be like well let's see what did happen to dr sebi and you know and let's see what
happened all that would be really actually triggering to people people would hate that um but it's like
so so absolute hyperstate is like there is a mythological quality but nonetheless there's the
actual what is the impact of my action in relation and it's not simply unveiling the myth to show the
hyperstate to show this you could say this essential split between like factuality and religious belief
right um ultimately is a taking responsibility of you have a actual force um and so this so this is
these are some examples of the absolute hyperstate and they were developed historically there are
historical developments but it's more important that they exist currently than that even though it is
true they were developed historically in so far as they were developed historically it can have some
impacts or you can relate to it in different ways but so that this is this is interacting so i i wanted
to say like describing the absolute hyperstate one it's solid like a like rock like this is like the first
secondly um you put yourself in relation to it it's not it's it's both truth and the obfuscation of it
and thirdly it's the total efforts of humankind so it's a very large object hence absolute hyperstate
yeah i think from all that part two was what i understood the most because it's like you got to
see you got to put yourself into the equation in some sense and see in relation to you how does this
all exist yes yeah and and also i guess i can see why why you still say you take like a scientific
approach because it's like a almost like a not a critical lens like the critical theory you negate
everything but rather uh let's call it like you're you're like an investigative approach you want to
you want to know you want to investigate as to how all these things uh all these signifiers symbolic
meanings you know whatever you call them uh connect to each other or or did i get that wrong am i am i
again putting you know unnecessary concepts into what no i think that's a fair question so like i think
they're speaking of the split a split is an essence right so yeah so like yeah how how am i going to put
myself in relation is one question and the second is what is the nature of the thing which is a different
question right so i would i would argue kind of in the sense that you could even say this goes all the
way to stoicism which is to say like this is a question of stoicism but it's so abstract that
people have such different answers like hegel being essence concept great idea but like abstract
right which means there's a lot of different interpretations of being essence in concept
uh so like the stoics the way the stoics related to like figuring out what is the nature of the
thing it appears as a whole i understand the nature of it i put myself in alignment with what i'm in
control of um i would just say you're not simply in but the way they do this is and i live as a
philosopher so the way i do this is i'm informed by stoic virtues so this part i don't do but i mean
these other parts are correct right which is like that i would say there is a kind of nature of
things or there which is like even human creations not just like nature but like human creations have
a nature and i believe this as well like human creations do have a they have properties i would
say their nature is they have when you reflect they have essential properties that are like solid
right even though you can't necessarily like grasp the concept like i could say like for instance the
train has the idea of transport has the idea of convenience it has these things it has this this
general idea of dignity like what gives people dignity you could say i like this con so let i i
really appreciate you saying oh this has some dignity let's like maybe hold on to this concept as
maybe this is the progressive concept yeah right which is like we're trying to give dignity to people
but that can even be represented by i have ease of public transport i have a four-day work week
what should my taxes be so like dignity is a i think i'm glad you brought up this concept
because like you can see how in the you know antithetically speaking in zizek in the clinic which
is a very like i said hysteric book which is good it's almost like the antithesis is before the thesis
because it's there's a chapter in zizek in the clinic that says the master is the provider of
convenience right so then it's like you could follow this it's like who is providing you dignity
what do they want right this is this is like what me in my 20s is like more skeptical i would say
like but but i mean this is i think this is all in there it's like you you can have a kind of
critical lens to convenience and dignity itself um so yeah but this is this is what it looks like to
go to the nature of the thing and why the con the concepts they're not simply idealist in so far as
like isn't that like how humans should be it's like no no no it's in the fucking thing
like like dip like just because you said dignity doesn't mean it's not in the train system
right the dignity is in the train and you can kind of put yourself into relationship
with that via the concept yeah okay all right this is this is probably a good juxtaposition with uh
iron rent's ego self-interest yeah for her she's still she in fact i'd say iron rand is still a
wittgensteinian in the sense that she's a she's an atomist it's like a logical atomist whereas for you
you see this idea of self-interest uh the the the the ego with its with its hyperstate in social
structures in it like it goes beyond the the silo of an individual yeah what if your ego was made of
the same substance as the train track out there and i think this is like this is like a weird unit it's
like a unified unified field thought and that's that's kind of what i'm kind of implying and i
think like people try to get to this point or spinoza gets to this point the whole like in this basic
though yeah thinking the whole thinking like it's god working themselves out and so but like in a very
basic it's i'm it's not it's not so exciting like always like but i'm trying to kind of give a good
ground for factuality so if i think of my ego as the same thing as the train track the you what is
the the unified concept of dignity which is to say i am providing dignity to clients this you know the
state is kind of providing dignity trying to to workers and the people in there um there is a unified
concept i can start thinking through and when you're able to switch the kind of concept and
like for instance like let's talk about class or whatever right this is like there's a class of
train workers there's a there's a class of people taking the train there's like you know security and
like the people they're in charge of on the train uh there's like how we're you know working class
people relate to other working class people in the kind of splits there's what's my role is a kind of
cognitariat person who's uh you know a teleworker so it gives you a different perspective but it's a
very large object and it's condensed and it's i mean maybe i'll start saying hyper mediated because it's
like it's so it's so hyper mediated it's kind of unmediated because it's like it's kind of like
like a rock like like i said it's like it's there it's like it's like really there and you can kind
of like do things with it right not not mate i i get what you're saying i mean i'm anyway i'm like
i'm sounding like nisha like screaming off the mountain now so this is like similarities which is
like it's there it's in the like the concept is in the thing it's you know i i find it interesting
the whole thing about mediation i'm so corrupted by zizek and hegel that i can't not think unmediated
i mean it's funny you know zizek has this thing about like you know when you're having sex with
someone you you aren't really with the person there's someone else there there's a fantasy and
ever since i heard zizek say that now that's in my head and i've had you know terrible sex life
because i can't though the fantasy is is in my head anyway it's it's a intimacy is a good concept
exactly so it's uh what does that mean for you yeah yeah that's interesting uh elliot this is going
to be uh penultimate question because i kind of want to do conclude on your project of hyper psychology
even though i know we did touch on that but it's worth worth saying this because i again i've been
thinking a lot about this especially you know reading by you and all that um love so you in
there's a chapter on friendship which i really enjoyed it's not is it a chapter or like a section
on friendship in in the book yeah but i'm interested you know and and i mean love again not in like in the
eros and erotic sense i mean love that in a broader concept and like a metaphysical way let's say
what's yeah through your you know through your ideas through what you what you're putting forward
how do you yeah what are your interventions on love so love and then you said in a broader context which
is to say so this is like one of the things i like about friendship and also maybe you could even say
this is a positive social media you can have this conversation there's not a lot is at stake but the
thing so this is kind of like like we're talking it's kind of nice our kind of core things that we
need in life are not like really at stake so like love love broader than a romantic way i can only think
of like familial love right um maybe maybe friends but like i like intuitively i think like um
um i think love in a psychoanalytic sense is quite powerful which is to say your familial
attachments and you know how concepts get kind of you know condensed with your intuition and your kind
of core functions so this is like maybe not how everyone would think if you're if you're talking about
love beyond a romantic concept love kind of in the initial familial way so determines who you are
like in terms of what your interest will be uh because you will be constantly intuiting kind of
these are my interests and also it can be negative which is to say like if you have a abusive upbringing
it doesn't matter you'll still start to attach love to being abused right and you'll and people have to
work through so love has this negative potential as well which is to say like our intuition maybe brings
us into a pattern of acting uh in ways that ultimately like is feels bad but it's our self-interest we
don't why is it our self-interest because it's it's reflective of our early childhood it's reflective
of love right so love can be very can have these kind of tricky qualities as well um
uh insofar as like romantic love like then this is like also romantic love is kind of kind of
interesting insofar as like in a relationship like depending on how long you've been in the
relationship romantic love is the new thing it's like it's happening you could say if you're in a
relationship and you're dealing with the old familial love right your attachments and they're getting
conflated right and this is where you get freud like what's with the conflation of familial love
and romantic love and then people understand freud is like ergo ergo your mom and so on but i mean
but this in terms of the real force of it is like the force of you could say the attachment concept
this is a good this is like it's hard to avoid the attachment concept because it's a good it's a good
kind of solid con so much so entire schools of psychotherapy are all based off on the very on this
word attachment right um so i think love is something that we tarry with and it also brings in kind of
your life structures as well like how how do you structure your life how do your how does your life
start to reflect the things that you like or don't like and so love is love is like a powerful core
like i would say of like if you get into self-interest and then like you know and that
core can be like bad in some ways like the core can be like uh like repeating uh dynamics from early
childhood right so this is like where we're basic kind of psychology insights of psychoanalysis
are important maybe they're really important in terms of developing like what is your understanding of
love like how did you get this intuition right um and it's really powerful and so far i think i've
told this like a few different times but like you know somebody comes into therapy and they keep
finding out that the people that they're dating were arrested for the same non-violent somewhat obscure
crime as their father and they kept finding it out afterwards they're like what the
fuck so this is like there's a speaking of algorithm i'm going to go against society in a specific
criminal way right uh in order to make money and that means that act affects how i how i relate to
everything like how i behave right um and suddenly there's some so then the person's child sees that
in their father and suddenly when they see that algorithm or this behavior it's totally they don't
know how they know it it's a black box like ai is a black box like it's a black box they don't know how
they know it they just know it and they they associate it with love it's like and they have the
same problem of other logic as dating a criminal who does this crime it has a problem like it comes
so then so then it's like why is this happening and you could say because love is associated with this
pattern and it can be challenging to meet people that are outside of your early childhood
i you know intuition so but this is also an important practice as well
right to be able to kind of meet new types of so there's this these this is love and process so i
think of concepts you know this is heraclitus's basic insight it's love is not a static category love is
this process so like the question is what how do you how do you process things like what's your
what's your algorithm yeah i mean i guess in that sense what i have used because i think i still
you know speaking specifically of romantic love here i i sell my penchant is more towards the badooian
you know love event disjuncture you wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily put it that way you i just don't
doesn't appeal to me because of my psychology you could say like love is disjuncture so like but
so i would have to like let's uh i'd have to go outside my psychology and be like okay i've heard
this from zizek as well love is that love is evil right love love has a quality where you you go against
the thing and then to be like marcus aurelius is like well it's either it is or it isn't it's not
always true like for instance love can be part of your social good quite easily that can happen as
well so like um so i would that this is like being a philosopher philosopher is like i i try to
represent truth this is what dialectic is in the ancient sense which is like
like like ultimately that myth may have a function to say love is evil it's like it's a provocation
um but i like and zizek is super inspiring but he says things that are uh that are myths you could
say like in this case yeah yeah like love is evil that's not it's not true well but it can be and it
points you to a direction right well interesting it's like he's like a spoken word poet right he
has a problem but then you know like in baju for instance he has this for him the disjuncture
and i think in um being an event here even goes into this quite deeply but it's like after the event
you recreate a new myth for yourself in some sense as it's not like our love is evil and you fall and
it's just the abyss and yeah but rather you need to recreate a new myth in in maybe in uh ross and
stalking terms in your self-interest uh but but also i would also add to the new myth it's also
possibly an old myth but the relation is new because it's actual and present i say okay well like fit up
so but like and i don't say this to like i don't say this to like dab and badoo but in so far as like
what is like not what is not true so and when when i when people talk to me i'm very open if i say
something that's not people say they are but like if i say something that's missing something or lack
and i can't say it all as lacan says and on this television when they put the kid they're like yeah
he scams everyone to get on camera because there's no social media and he goes you can't say it all which
i like more than peterson i'd rather have a look like how was the french tai lopez yeah yeah yeah
yeah who's that the the uh here in my garage guy uh here oh you got made he was like in the 2015s i
think he was a big uh hit my garage with all the books uh trying to sell you right self-help courses yeah
anyway oh got it got it yeah so i was um but no that that's great thanks i think i think i'm
getting at your i'm trying to put myself in your shoes in some sense and it's it's sort of working
so uh i'm curious so this you know i'm reading all these books trying to make sense of your project but
then yeah can you articulate your project of you call that hyper psychology like the next book you're
writing as in if i could ask a bit of a i don't know melodramatic question here like what's your
what do you what do you see as your life project in what you're doing right now in in this field of
psychology i would say the idea is to bring psychology out so like the subtitle that it's currently is a
subject beyond itself i like right yeah which is to say like ultimately
hyper psychology is like it transcends psychology into the life right and and insofar as life is the
subject of psychology like what it's kind of like some structure that will introduce somebody in to a
maybe like philosophical or you could even say truth truth adjacent i don't want to sound like a
you know must uses these words as well which is like uh truth it should be as truth aligned as
possible it's like but you don't know what the foundation of thought is so how are you going to
make a truth aligned like like you don't anyway you can like in terms of factuality and hey but but
yeah so that the the project of hyper psychology is how do we integrate other aspects of life like how
do we talk about dignity it's like for instance i like i want to think more about this word that you
brought up which is dignity right um and so insofar as hyper psychology allows you to think it's important
my self-interest is in the development of the concept of dignity because it relates to my cause
it relates to what i think is good it relates to my my just core like flow of day-to-day so you need
you need to be able this is kind of like if you want to be a hyper psych psychotherapist
or whatever this would be the the style of thinking which is to say on the terms of the
word itself which is to say like let's think let's think dignity in our day-to-day life
like for now but it might change in terms of that might develop so this is the dialectical process
in terms of what this this is a starting point it can kind of grow from there it can develop but insofar
as hyper psychology is a word that allows for the framework of that dialectical process right and you'd
say eventually you just want psychology to become hyper psychology it's just going to be about life
as such yeah which is which is to say i would be fine if people just under if they understood that
and didn't say hyper psychology every five like you don't have to say hyper psychology to develop
to do this process of what is hyper unmediated or hyper mediated hyper state or whatever to like to
to to kind of put yourself into relation with all the concepts it's like why is why is dignity sticking
out because dignity is a it's a concept i think it transcends politics right um it it's kind of
it is related to politics but it kind of also like it kind of says the dignity of peoples without good
political views it says during conflict like for instance i'm thinking like marcus aurelius writing
the meditations but he's at war so there's this like it's kind of hard like uh to be in conflict
with somebody and ultimately you're like fighting them concretely is there is does dignity come into
play what what and i mean this is kind of like so i think i think this is a important kind of concept
and i want people to be able to understand that their intuition can turn into conceptual
developments in this way like and it goes down ultimately to it to this core psychoanalytic
dream concept like in terms of you have an intuition beyond your intuition or beyond your impulse impulse
yeah you're in your intuition is your totality of your psyche right um and so you have you can't
ever access this totally just like you can't ever access absolute hyper state or all of being or
every concept all at once you you have to kind of put yourself in relationship to this and it's kind
of a suggested relation to cons concepts and intuition right beautiful beautiful that's the uh
perfect place to end it thank you elvia thank you for your time i'll leave a link to all the books
in fact you're jerking the clinic you just left the free version online so i'll leave a link to that
too and also no please steal the books and i and i can't say anymore but just just steal them or if
you want the books you'll have to yeah yeah yeah anyway it's it's uh i i highly recommend it i'd say i'd
say you know have have some self-respect and you know respect your dignity and struggle through the
writing and you you'll get at it it's it's it's it's worthwhile uh but yeah thank you for your time
uh i really appreciate it great so take care thanks mate
