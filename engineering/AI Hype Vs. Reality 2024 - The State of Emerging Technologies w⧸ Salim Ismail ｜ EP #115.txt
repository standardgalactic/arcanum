if you've got open ai versus google versus china versus anthropic if there's a step function
interpreted or intercepted by one of them it's game over then again disagree for my former
reasons if i could know anything or if i could predict anything how would it impact my business
ai is in the super intelligence feels really powerful on the doing stuff but the being is
where all the the future emanates from and where power comes from people don't realize the fact
that we're living in a time where the things we take for normal and for granted are truly god-like
you know decades ago or centuries ago completely
welcome to moonshots and a special episode of wtf is happening in tech this week
myself and salim ismail salim good to see you buddy good to be back for those of you who don't know
salim he is one of the most extraordinary tech thinkers on the planet was head of innovation at
yahoo for their brick house innovation labs join me at singular university as our first president there
has gone on to write a number of best sellers including exponential organizations i had the
pleasure of of uh of co-authoring exponential organizations too with salim you now heads open exo
uh salim before we jump in talking about ai bitcoin robotics all that stuff uh where can people find
you on social uh easiest places absolutely miss mail which is my twitter handle or x handle and secondly
opening openingxo.com which is our global community of up close to 40 000 enthusiasts technologists
entrepreneurs innovators etc so we think about how do you organize for this crazy future that's
hurtling at us um in terms of institutional change and organizational change you know you said my x handle
that was pretty good you almost said my twitter handle i know that you know it's funny because elon put
out a uh a i'm gonna say a tweet put out a uh what do you call it you put out a it's a post a post okay
he put out a post and he said should i still call it x or should i call it twitter and i i messaged back
at him i said i need a verb i need a verb and a post is not a good verb and you know tweeting is a great
verb so elon if you're listening we need a better version of xing all right let's jump in uh we're gonna
be talking on this episode on what's been happening in the last few weeks in the subjects of ai bitcoin
robotics and biotech and other cool stuff let's start with ai um wow so uh here we go the future
of search is it gpt search or google i mean google's had an incredible you know global dominance for so
long uh what do you think about this slim you know uh there's there's they've had massive dominance uh
when when microsoft integrated chat gpt into bing it didn't make a dent uh i think it's incredible
what google has done um and there's an important point here the the course just ruled google a
monopoly and there's some rationale to that but eric schmidt and others have said it's just a click away
to use on other search engines so it's really uh by sheer uh focus on user experience that they've
become this amazing um i think the the way that google is integrating uh gpt to you know gemini
results right at the top of the search for us will keep it ahead i think it's a hard thing to break
through that because they just have so much data and a b testing around what uh search results should
look like etc you know this this reminds me of the fact that the user interface is so extraordinary uh
critical right so when google you know i mean listen you were at yahoo and yahoo was like this
massively complex page and they were worried about where everything was going and then google came
out with just like a simple like box to type stuff into and it's it's really really hard it you know
can i give you a quick story from the yahoo days yeah sure um you had this mail interface and yahoo mail
was like predominant for for many many years it turned out via a b testing if you moved the send
button by just a few pixels one way the other the usage dropped off pretty dramatically because users
got habituated to that that layout and it was really hard to change it so you need a paradigm shift
change like the google change to make a difference otherwise you're stuck because you've trained your
users and operating one way the ui design changes were unbelievably difficult in incremental mode
well we've seen the same thing with you know frankly chat gpt became this very simple user
interface right the functionality of chat gpt um was there before but when they made it like just you
know type at me um all of a sudden it took off to a million users and well this is that comment
you always talk about the deceptive right that when you make a technology usable it goes from disrupt
deceptive to disruptive but let me ask you a question when you need a piece of data
do you google or do you go to chat gpt and ask the question there i'm these days i'm doing both
just because the triangulation of that uh becomes it's so easy to ask in both environments but i do
think that gpt uh search gpt 4.0 whatever's coming next is taking a bite out of google and we'll we'll talk
about that um in in just a little bit let's go to the next uh story for this week man this was a big
one uh why don't you kick this one off and i'll play the video while we're while we're talking over
it yeah you know it's hard to to engage with this stuff we're crossing the uncanny valley as they
talk about it in this area and it's very very difficult to deal with this um because we just our
human perceptions can't cope with what the ais can generate now look at any of the modern games and
you see it you missed the point there though this is a fake video this is like fully generated and
it's like it's you could not tell the difference between realistic and this generated video so yeah
flux with laura and gen 3 alpha you know again this is just the beginning important to know we've been
predicting this for a long time right at the what's the point at which a uh the resolution of an ai
generated image exceeds the the pixelation of the human eye and we've now crossed that rubicon and so
how we navigate this future is going to be really really crazy to tell i love this one um here's
again we're using ai to bring anything to life uh and let's take a look at this i mean you know two
years ago someone looking at that would have assumed it was real not to usually probably four or five
years ago that it was real and being able to bring you know mozart to life here like this
i mean the ai is taking a lot of liberty in in its translation but holy cow that's extraordinary
i i i bucket this with the the previous slide right like this that the the what we're going
to now be able to do is so amazing i'm really looking forward to having you know real full-on
conversations in video mode with a play-doh and aristotle and you had that at the abundance summit
i think that that becomes it actually uh opens up our history in a really powerful way unlike
anything we've ever seen before you know um one of the things that we're beginning to see is people
bringing their loves one loved ones back right those who have passed and i think we've talked about this
before and just if you're if you're listening if your mom and dad are still with you your grandparents
still with you take a moment to go and record them on your iphone uh record their voice um you know
sit them down for two or three hours give them a glass of wine and get them to talk you know uh
whimsically about their history and you can train up an ai model that's going to be with you for the
next century um you know i i've got to give kudos here to ray kurzwell right who 20 years ago has been
doing this for the last 30 40 years recording every scrap of data he could about his father
yeah and collecting it and aggregating it because he predicted that at some point we would be able
to train al models to do that and now we're there uh my dad is just about 97 now um and every time
i see him he's still with it mentally right he's like living alone driving around he shouldn't be doing
any of that um uh and the but the every time i'm with him now i throw on a camera and i just record
everything that's amazing because it's going to be incredibly powerful to bring back that the other
thing i haven't gotten to is how do you bring back the the sheer wisdom that comes with that level of
age and what he's seen well i think the wisdom is going to come back for for our grandkids from us if
we ever considered wise i don't know by the sheer volume of the you know the x posts i can't say the
tweets we put out there the all the blogs we've written all of that becomes sort of a compiled
version it does but for the elder generation we have such little you know think of the black and
white stills we have of our great grandparents yeah right there's very little can i can i tell
you a super funny little story about my dad again i did one of my meaning of life sessions right and
some of the audience said hey i really loved your talk fixing civilization this tedx talk i did
my dad's hand goes up he goes can i heckle i'm like yeah of course you can you know he was totally
disagree with your talk i'm like what do you do not think we need to fix civilization he goes yeah
of course we do but it's not this fixing part it's the civilization part he goes we've not civilized
the world we've materialized the world now we have to do the work to civilize the world i totally lost
the audience because you're like you know wisdom bomb from the elders boom and it was a profound
comment i've been sitting with that for the last couple of years it's a really powerful framing
that we actually we're apes with tools operating in tribal paradigms and this is a nightmare for the
future yeah uh you know the other comment along those lines and i've been you know i'm working on
on my next book age of abundance with stephen kotler and our opening chapter is uh titled our ancestors
would see us as gods right and i mean i think people don't realize the fact that we're living in a
time where the things we take for normal and for granted are truly god-like you know decades ago
centuries ago completely it's it's really incredible that you can video with anybody anywhere in the
world pretty much for free yeah speaking about creating you know live video imagery from conversation
or whatever um artists win key ruling in ai copyright case thoughts i have strong thoughts
about this this is the you know we talk about the the transition from film photography to digital
photography right when you go from a material substrate to a digital substrate and all of a sudden
the domain explodes because we can take billions of times more photographs for free
and we talk about breeding to digital biology is the same kind of analogy our old ip laws entire our
entire entire intellectual property framework doesn't work in a digital age because if you think about
how a human being looks at a copyrighted work they'll watch a bunch of film clips a bunch of music
videos and they'll create something and subconsciously use those same patterns i agree all he has doing is
accelerating that dramatically it's tax that seems absurd it's insane because you know an artist goes
to the louvre and is inspired by the by the work i mean all they're doing is training their own neural
net in the same way that these ais are training their neural nets and so like you're going to say to
somebody i'm sorry you were inspired by da vinci and you're copying him this is totally the luddite
revolt etc now we don't know what the actual answer is right yeah um the the best answer
may be what we've seen in music where the digit the the music stuff becomes uh table stakes and
the live performances where people make all their money and so something similar like that has to
emerge in in different artistic domains well i'll give you an example uh you know you know bill gross
for the ceo of idea lab uh bill has a new company uh called prorata.ai that i think has just been
announced like this week and what they're doing is they've built models that are able to go
and search the body of existing work and then create statistical ties back to a new
generated piece of work and the idea there is that if someone is making money off of something
and they have copied or they've been using content out of exo um out of our book that there's some small
amount of uh revenue that traces back to us so it's it's very similar to uh the search models that
that have powered google for example anyway it's it's definitely a worthwhile endeavor i don't know
how you fully applied or enforce it but it's worth doing let's see if it works um you know i added
this to our stack uh ai and weather forecasting because i'm still blown away by the power of massive
data analytics that these models can take on so the idea that you know the most accurate 10-day forecasts
are now coming out of ai models um and of course that's what that's what ai does is it takes a
seemingly massive amount of uncorrelated data and is able to make interpolations and extrapolations
and where this is going for me is ai being able to predict earthquakes being able to predict stock
markets being able to predict a whole slew of different things all sorts of stuff and this has
massive real world implications you may have heard me speak about the car washes in buenos aires yeah
yeah i remember that if a 20 50 drop in revenues over a 20-year period just because we were better
able to model when it's going to rain and when you know it's going to rain you don't wash your car and
that's such a huge impact on an industry and the key there is you can be the smartest car wash owner in
the world and you'll just never see that coming and this is i think the orthogonal effect of
technology on domain after domain after domain better or worse it's just going to change uh
everything well i think this is where as an entrepreneur you need to be looking at uh you
know if i could know anything or if i could predict anything how would it impact my business
right whether you're in the fashion business or the car wash business or the you know the gardening
business um uh if you're able to that's the hard part is saying what would i want to know and if i
could know that how would it give me different economics a different business model honestly as
you're saying this the whole vector appears to me right which is you get an ai sophisticated enough
and say you go look through the different domains and figure out where you could make a massive economic
impact and come back to me and we'll take out the best five i mean that's the that's the whole idea
of like you know the the billion dollars two trillion dollar you know ai startup with one one one guy
or gal and their dog and an ai uh is becoming a unicorn i mean but that's that's cheating to just
say go make me money all right well no i don't believe it is every 20 year old is out there doing
exactly that yeah but i think you should have at least uh you know you should say go make me money in
something i care about or oh but this becomes key right now and comes back to you with 20 things
how do you filter and you'll have to filter according to your mtp yeah and that's where
things become really important i mean that's one of the things that we that we pointed out in the
exponential org work is that you have to begin with your massive transformative purpose your mtp
that thing you care about i mean every time just had the vcon conference um and uh jay shetty
on stage apparently shouted it out and said the most important thing you can have is a massive
transformative purpose nice good getting out that lexicon out there you know the times i have failed
in a business um have been when and this is on two occasions i know where i tried to go quick get
money like you know like that that will be a quick you know get rich quick scheme and the fact of the
matter is if you don't care about it every business is hard and you're going to give up before you
know it looks easy from a distance the closer you get you see all the all the uh the pimples and
wrinkles and problems yeah and then you give up because you don't actually give a about it
we should have a debate with scott galloway because he just put out a book saying
you're following your passion is full utter you shouldn't do that follow where your talent is
um and i i looked at that i read this and i'm like i totally wanted to debate this obviously
he's going for the attention there i would it turns out i had a great talent for designing large
scale uh databases enterprise databases that is not where any interest of mine ever fell
and who the hell wants to spend your life doing that all right meta releases the largest
open uh model in history um you know there's this ongoing debate of open versus closed
all right we've got hugging face we've got meta you know even grok even elon said we're going to make
grok open source um you know i do believe that this is important for a whole slew of reasons
the question is you know we've got on the closed side of the equation we've got google and we've got
microsoft slash open ai um you know can the open source models compete financially with closed source
okay i've got a bunch of thoughts here i think there's a clear future coming out um it's the
open source models are are overtaking the closed source models over time so i think they're really
an arms race where a closed source model gets to say gpt4 right you get to chat gpt4 and and they
have a lead for a bit but then the open source models catch up very quickly and you just the
whole domain just moves forward that much more quickly because of it in the end open always beats
closed yeah that was one of google's principles which is why i'm kind of surprised they've gone
closed and not open here i think the they've got so much under the hood and we'll talk a little bit
more about that in a few slides that that they don't know how to open it up um i think oh meta's
done it just be catch up and i i gotta give huge kudos here to mark and the entire team at meta for
doing this they've gone really they've done some amazing work at open sourcing ai models is pushing
the boundaries for everybody's forcing the close guys to really push forward more quickly and open
themselves up also for sure um your buddy vitalik on super intelligence um shall i play the video then
then we'll chat about it yeah yeah he says here uh he argues that uh if one ai pulls out ahead uh
during this period of super exponential growth uh that it's game over that ai wins all right let's
play the video if you imagine i mean like every yeah ai growing exponentially then like whatever the
existing different like ratios of power are all get preserved but if you imagine it growing super
exponentially right then what happens is that if you're a little bit ahead then like the the ratio of
the lead actually starts increasing and then the worst case is if you have a step function right
then whoever first discovers like some magic leap which could be discovery of nanotechnology could be
discovery of like something that increases compute by a factor of 100 could be some algorithmic improvement
would be able to just like immediately turn on that improvement and then they'd you know quickly
expand they'd quickly be able to find you know like all of the other possible improvements before
anyone else and then they'd take over everything right in an environment as kind of like unknown and
unpredictable as that like are you really actually going to get kind of a bunch of courses that like
roughly stay yeah you know with inside of each other in the race so it's game over at that point um
first of all uh is he an alien or what well you can see his brain literally trying to break out of his
head right um uh vitalik is just the one of the most magnificent he's extraordinary intelligences
around um i have a huge beef with this you do okay yeah can i go on my i actually agree with him and
i like it what's okay okay okay let me go on my little rant here yeah um this happens to be uh across
the board with folks in this like mo god that break her as well etc when you think about intelligence
my beef is what the hell do you mean by intelligence because there's about a dozen
facets of intelligence the iq test as we know it only measures two of them the the speed of thought
processing and the ability to match a concept across multiple frameworks we don't talk about emotional
intelligence or the eastern concept or presence or awareness we don't talk about linguistics
intelligence music intelligence spatial intelligence there's a whole bunch of factors and when you make
a decision or a choice as a leader you're bringing a lot of that thinking a lot of those different
facets to bear emotional intelligence for example so the beef i have here is please for god's sakes
before you go talking about intelligence define what you mean by it and have the courage to define
the term clearly okay well i'm going to define it as all of those things i'm going to define it as
you know when i'm speaking to someone who is intelligent their ability to uh to drive arguments to be
able to uh to speak um in a in a compelling fashion in a knowledgeable fashion about a subject and win
an argument or on another side being able to go bring a body of knowledge to drive and extrapolate into
a new breakthrough any of these things i mean human intelligence and all of its richness i i you know
i agree with these guys that we're going to reach that with uh with digital intelligence
if not next year in the next three or four years now the question becomes super intelligence is you
know as you know elon was saying it on stage at the abundance summit this year you know his prediction
is by 2029 2030 ai is of equal intelligence the entire human race now i mean we've talked about this
salim since the early days of singularity university where you know exponential growth you know what
happens when ai is a billion times more intelligent across all dimensions but hold on like what think
about i'll give you this this simple framing right okay you're looking to hire somebody and they uh
your gut is saying don't something's wrong don't hire them okay okay and there's some signal
to noise ratio or some pattern or detection pheromones god knows what where something something is not
clicking and you kind of go with your gut and we know what the value is of that that choice making
by the way you know do you know google did a study looking at video clips of an interviewee and the
interviewer and they they built a model to predict whether the person would get hired of course and how
much time did they require of the video interview to make the decision of we're going to hire and not
hired remember that number yeah it was like a few seconds yeah it was like under 30 seconds the first 30
second determines everything so there's a lot there's a lot of of data that's not but do you
think an ai can't pick that data up don't they could the prop the problem comes in replicating that core
function now also let's also note that um a simple ai uh uh hiring algorithm beats a human hiring manager
by 25 right that's again coming from from google because if i'm interviewing people subconsciously i'm
going to interview and hire a middle-aged indian ball guy because i think that's the best people
in the world not necessarily true yeah our cognitive biases really suck right so so you don't know we
but but there's so many different levels at which we're we're i did a tom bill you podcast a few weeks
ago and i talked about this we have our soul intelligence we have our emotional and subconscious
intelligence then we have our cognitive uh and rational intelligence right and we use all of that to make
deep choices and and decisions about the world um ai's right now coming from the top down we still
have no understanding of how we make choices at all evolutionary uh survival bias is the only way we've
gotten to where we are and we have no idea how we've gotten here so i think there's a big big uh beef
around this and remember at the abundance summit i asked ray specifically what do you mean by intelligence
and he goes oh my phone makes me smarter therefore that's what we mean by it and that's valid but a
complete sidestep of the question i would love to have a deeper like i'd love to get all these guys
together and challenge them with this framing and say guys let's talk about what do we mean by this
because your emotional intelligence has a huge bearing on your success as a leader in the future
that's not mimicked or modeled at all anywhere all right we missed we sidestepped the entire point of
italic was making though which is in a super intelligence race right if you've got open ai
versus google versus china versus anthropic whatever if one of them if there's a step function interpreted
or intercepted by one of them it's game over then it tips instantly in favor of that other individual
again disagree for my former reasons um uh all right look let me let me take another tack at this
we for long time you know there's a human being can operate in two modalities doing versus being
okay and doing is like getting out there and getting stuff done and being is just sitting with
yourself and being in both are needed for success as a human being and ai's in the super intelligence
feels really powerful on the doing stuff but the being is where all the the future emanates from and where
power comes from and afghan i'm going to like eastern metaphysics but there's a lot more to talk
about than just that all right well let's talk about this one so we've been hearing about project
strawberry for some time it is you know sam allman starts tweeting pictures of strawberry fields and so
we're expecting a release of uh of uh strawberry by the way which had previously been called qstar
and if you remember when when sam was fired by uh the board and just a small factoid one of the board
members who fired sam i wouldn't say the name but was a su graduate from our first our first class
anyway uh so qstar was like oh my god did they have agi you know there was all these rumors floating
around uh but project strawberry um thoughts salim uh okay counter to my previous point i'm incredibly
excited about this right why because machine learning just basic machine learning finds signal from noise
that a human being can't possibly see so when you take all of the you know uh uh research papers
thousands and thousands of millions of them published and pass it through an ai the ability
to see something and detect and figure out the future is going to be unbelievably powerful i think
for me as a form of a physicist i'm think we'll find entirely new physics that we couldn't discover
as human beings and solve the entanglement problem and isn't it once a physician theory and stuff
once a physicist always a physicist are you really a former physicist do you not think about things i'm just a
bad physicist in the classic term so i should call it former just like you with the with the md right
md yeah yeah do never come to me for anything else you know i do a two-for-one appendix removal
i'll take your both your appendices out so you know i think the idea of agents being able you know when
you ask a question of uh google foro or whatever it becomes i'm sorry google for great gpt4 or whatever
is next and it can spin up a multitude of agents to go do a bunch of research in a bunch of different
areas and then come back with a consolidated answer um that's a that is a big deal it's a big deal and
eric schmidt talked about this and i think we're going to cover that the there it's unbelievable i hate
the term agentic ai i just why i think that was pretty cool i mean it sounds like a drug to look
i had to look it up the first time yeah why not just say agent based um you know uh anyway that's
just that's just my biases or whatever real quick i've been getting the most unusual compliments lately
on my skin truth is i use a lotion every morning and every night religiously called one skin it was
developed by four phd women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that is a synolytic that kills
senile cells in your skin and this literally reverses the age of your skin and i think it's one
of the most incredible products i use it all the time uh if you're interested check out the show notes
i've asked my team to link to it below all right let's get back to the episode so this is uh from
the co-founder of zapier says ai language models have stalled in the progress of agi and increasing
scale will not help what is inherently limited technology i'm not going to play the video here
but there is a lot of conversation around will we get to agi right this is almost all these things
become religious in one standpoint um there's a group of folks who say no we're not going to get there
we don't have you know listen uh the uh nvidia chips the the gpus and the and the current um uh the
current large language models uh generative ai and the amount of data just isn't enough and others like
are you kidding me we're we're already there um i have a i have a little insight that we that we did
um that i'd love to talk about here okay i'd love so i did a little short conversation with hod
lipson who's an ai researcher um um does has a lab at colombia where they built self-assembly robots
with recursive algorithms to figure out um how um robots can self-improve and survive and build in
survival bias etc into the robots and he did something really profound and he has an angle to
this that i think really is the more most uh in-depth and clear that i've ever seen around the question of
agi and he basically said the self extent of self-awareness of any being is the ability to view
itself in the future like you and i are pretty good at knowing thinking what we might look like in five
years or what life might be like in five years and we can contemplate that a mosquito can't do that
right a dog can do it for like a few hours type of thing so i mean like like a dog can do it because
it's anticipating a walk or dinner yeah it can it has some concept of what modeling itself into the
future in the near future yeah in the near future in that case we can look out years sure and so he
basically used that vector and he went to gemini and chat gpt and said how would you view yourself in
a few years and apparently uh the question was shut down completely by the ai there are guardrails that
have been put into these ai models that essentially forbid the ai from picturing itself in the future
or in the past okay and he thinks this is deliberate that whole vector where ais seem to become sentient
and freaked out all the ai researchers and they shut it down or this may be what happened it at chat gpt
and now they've put guardrails and you can't ask the question so uh uh go try that out of course i'm
going to go and do that as soon as we finish but it's a really fascinating thing to think about is
that once you open up that and somebody will because once you have the open source models you
can load it up and ask whatever question you want once you get to that and an ai can perceive itself
or create a model of itself in the future um hod's uh conclusion is that self-awareness comes very
rapidly after that and a sense of self emerges very quickly that combined with massive access to
computation and information change the game completely so that's there's something really
incredibly powerful that we should delve a lot more into i love that idea so it is true just going back
to this it is true that the the agi models of ai models and llms have kind of stalled but i think
this is normal i remember that conversation i had with jeffrey hinton back in 2017 and asked him what's
the next steps in ai and he said we've reached the end of what we can do with deep learning we need
the next step and we don't know what that is and literally a few months later the transformer paper
was released i think we've now kind of seven eight years later come to the limitations and the boundary
conditions for llms and now we're going to go to the next level and again we don't know what that is
but it's being birthed right now i suspect uh eric schmidt um love the man he's amazing he's been an
incredible benefactor the x prize uh and he's a a very expansive thinker uh in the news this week a
couple of comments that he's made uh one about ai models and one about whether google is losing the
race with open ai and why let's talk about the uh what he said this this uh week about what's coming
up next year uh salim why don't you cover that one i'll cover the uh google yeah you know when you
look at when you look at how evolution works right you take half your genes from your mother and half
your genes from your father and you cross it and then survival bias and natural selection will pick
the best traits going forward and i think what's happening here is we've developed these different
threads in ai and in the case of eric he says we've got large context windows agents and text action
so we take the kind of genetic capabilities i'm using the front term loosely and now you combine
them the potential outputs and the outcomes will be really powerful incredibly uh uh incredibly powerful
and i think i'm incredibly excited where ai goes with this yeah i mean what could possibly go wrong i
mean so large context windows i mean just to to dive into each of those elements here we're talking about
you know loading in books and ultimately libraries movies everything and having you know so one of
the future versions of ais are ais on on your in your uh your employee team right so you can imagine having
an ai agent who steps in uh for marketing or design or you know tech and it reads it reads every
email ever written inside your organization it reads uh every slack channel and so on day one that ai
employee knows everything and is able to hold all of that in context that's incredible so for me this
becomes like the the slide rule to excel spreadsheet shift right you know every single employee every single
manager will have access to multiple agents that has access and can look at all the information in
a firm collectively and will just become better decision making engines again in one vector but i
think this is huge the potential here is unbelievable and then text to action is the fact that we're you know
ais don't live uh in full isolation there is a point now where you can say to your ai cook me dinner um
you know go and find this information go physically you know clean this thing i mean especially we'll
talk about robots in a little bit where robots become extend you know physical extensions of ais in the
world um the ability for ais to uh to have agentic capabilities i know you love that word well i think once
you have an ai that can program right which we cross that rubicon with uh gpt three and four um you
essentially have the ability for any ai to impact the real world um because so many of our devices
are programmable devices and we're essentially turning the world into information which they can
then be programmed and therefore uh we've crossed that divide and now an ai has true agency in terms
of what it can achieve in the physical world there's a really important other piece of just to be
go here relating back to the other one which is that when we talk about intelligence um it turns out that
the need the evolution of intelligence was almost completely the adaptive need to navigate in the
physical world and so again let's cover that more in the robotics part but that's a huge uh
rationale for why evolution created intelligence in new york cortex that functions in the first place
all right let's talk about the second one google losing open ai you know i've got to imagine that
at the executive conversations at google they're like wtf is going on here you know how did we possibly
get into this situation well here's what uh eric thinks uh made them uh second tier to open ai in
some areas google decided that work-life balance and going home early and working from home was more
important than winning and the startups the reason startups work is because the people work like hell
and i'm sorry to be so blunt but the fact of the matter is if you all leave the university and go
found a company you're not going to let people work from home and only come in one day a week wow
pretty damn spot on and ballsy of eric to say that um and i listen i know this is okay maybe we're
gonna disagree on this right because in the whole exo model you know it's like just distributed and all
those benefits but listen the companies that i've seen i've invested in the companies i've built when
you're there in the thick of it physically all together seven days a week you got to believe
that you know i just went and and visited um uh zipline um and i just did a podcast with the
with the ceo of zipline and when i was physically there the energy right of you know hundreds of people
like literally crammed into this office with dashboards up on the walls you don't get that virtually
you don't get that kind of energy that kind of drive i mean it's a new organism that comes out
when i was at figure uh with brett adcock you know the team is there you know 7 a.m to 9 p.m
every day just and they are excited about what they're building i don't know work from home
you know okay uh this i think these are two different topics that he's conflating here and i
take the very very big risk of disagreeing with eric which is what was one of the smartest and wisest
people in the world um i think the work from home versus physical presence does have a factor and i
totally agree with you there right there's an energy that comes from like for example we just had a
massive win at open exo and i can't i can't high five anybody around me and there's a big loss from
that that connection that human connection go straight back to the comment we just had around
um uh human beings and being physically mode we you know year for years we thought virtual
conferences would take over real conferences but people love the scarcity of the human connection
and conference in-person conferences are more popular than ever so i completely get the in-person
versus remote work and the difference there i disagree that that's the reason that ai is opening
as beating uh google and i'll take you back to facebook okay um facebook beat yahoo and myspace
and google etc with a very simple um organizational heuristic which was zuckerberg said to his developers
if you think your code is ready to ship just go live on the live site you better make sure you've tested
the hell out of it uh but but and the the the the developers had this unbelievable sense of
empowerment and they were like wow the the trust he trusts us with this amazing and they were putting
out features uh 10 times faster than yahoo or myspace or google okay uh it comes down to organizational
design the fact that in google if you talk to google employees today to try and get anything done
there's so much bureaucracy yeah it's taking forever to do that's the thing that's slowing it down i think
he's conflating those two things operating in a big company today means you have these control
framework layers etc and i've got all sorts of war stories from yahoo about this the the the reason yahoo
failed is terry semel by accident put in a classic matrix structure and managed the company um and that
structure is great for uh um scaling and control but it's terrible for taking risk and it's terrible for
speed and if you're on the consumer internet the two attributes you better have are speed and risk
you look at google and how much investment they put into google plus uh they had all the world's
top researchers the product is absolutely brilliant but all the internal hurdles of having to navigate
should it connect with the youtube id system and whatever basically by the time they got through all
of that facebook was gone and so this is the issue i think is the internal organizational design
much much more so than whether i do i do i do agree with you there right agility agility always wins you
know and we've studied this to death in the exo model right and i'll just carry out this little
quick plug here we studied the fortune 100 and said okay how many of these use the exo model or the
attributes of the model like autonomous teams community dashboards whatever um and we found that
in the fortune 100 over a seven-year period the companies that followed the model the most delivered
40 times the shareholder returns on the companies that followed the model the least so really it comes
down to the organizational design as a main heuristic for survival in the future in the and and this is
where companies will end up following the structure because we now have so much proof the more of the
model you use the better you'll do so i think i think the without realizing it eric is commenting on the
organizational structure of google versus open ai being comprised of small teams that are just doing
whatever the hell they want and the sad thing of course you know we and i discussed this with eric
when when he was with us at uh at abundance last year at the abundance summit was that google had a
massive lead right in ai uh ahead of everybody and was actually being respectful and careful and not
putting it out before it was fully tested and then when uh when sam altman put out you know chat gpt it
was like okay gloves are off you know put on the racing sneakers let's go and and to give them
full credit they've responded incredibly well gemini is amazing what it can do yeah i mean i don't want
to take anything away from google i i they are the juggernaut i would still never bet against them
but uh they're they're they've got uh they've got real competition it's the curse of being a big
company the control frameworks you have to put in place prevent you from being nimble and today the
name of the game is being nimble uh for sure um let's talk about this uh so uh our friend imad mustak
previously ceo of uh open of opening i stability of stability puts out a paper uh called how to think
about ai um and uh i did a podcast with him uh i think imad is pretty damn brilliant um and
uh it's a great paper uh we'll put the link in the show notes to this podcast that i think people
uh should should read you know i'm just going to point out a few things uh he is still a believer that
ai is going to be creating as many or more jobs than it's going to steal um he talks about one of the
ideas that was discussed on the on the stage at abundance last year of this ai atlantis uh imagining
new continent is created of a hundred million um ai researchers who work for a few electrons
versus pizzas under the door and your ability to get access to intelligence and use it um is
demonetizing and democratizing around the world i know you had a chance to look at this a little bit
any comments about what imad's uh thoughts are here um i i i'm in total accordance with almost
everything that you imad said uh i i've been on the soapbox of ais won't take all the jobs
i'm very clear about that i finally have a decent rationale around that by the way i'd like to hear
that so i was on part of a kind of in a working group with eric brynyolson and a few others on
ai and employment right and there was a really powerful framing that i've not forgotten
and they said look a job is not just a job i feel like a a customer service person uh it actually
you take that let's say you're a financial advisor okay there's different components of that that job
that that can be broken down to a set of actual tasks and the task would be interface with the
customer uh do some research um make investment decisions and act out on those investment decisions
etc etc well an ai to say the 27 tasks that go into being a financial advisor might automate like 10
of them but it doesn't automate the rest of them and so what happens is a job doesn't you don't lose
the job you lose the tasks uh you automate the tasks which makes you more powerful and you spend
more time on the other areas which is human interaction and uh thinking about the future etc and
therefore the reason ais don't take all the jobs they're not covering the job they're covering one
specific task or other even even ag only covers specific areas it'll increase but more and more
that's why you will have amplified jobs not job radical job loss except for the areas where
doing one thing at a time if you were in the industrial revolution of widget stamping as a human
in the widget stamping out things on the assembly line that job went away because it was one thing
so that's my that i found was the best framing i've seen for why ais won't take a lot of jobs so
listen i i do think that is the case today that ais can do 80 but not a hundred percent of a job and
therefore they're freeing up people and and humans do the whole job with the support of ais but i have
a hundred percent confidence that ais will get to a point where they can do a hundred percent of the job
and from everything i've seen what i used to think would be the holdout of humanity that interpersonal
relationship the ability to be compassionate and um and you know understanding and and patient and that human
connection holy shit i've seen ais do a much better job on that than than humans agree agree but i think
there's i'll take you back uh to the autonomous driving conversation right okay we had autonomous
cars since the google car in 2008 and we confidently predicted that in a decade you'd have more than 20
penetration of autonomous cars it's been slow etc and the answer the reason is that even in an autonomous
car those little edge cases of a bicyclist overtaking another bicyclist and now you have to kind of go
wider because of that or just avoiding potholes we can't do there's all these edge cases that we can't
cover a hundred percent of because human beings are so good at adaptive uh in physical intelligence
that a human a robot driver can't cover all of that and is very far away from that and therefore we're
very far away from that domain i think we're going to end up with the same pair paradigm around this
however to your point i think what we'll do is reframe what we mean by a job so that as can take
more and more of it and therefore the human being gets squeezed over time there's a lot um i really
commend this paper to everybody you could listen to my podcast with imad on this subject but if you
haven't yet go and and imad tweeted the whole paper on his thing so at imad if you want to go check
it out yeah uh for for sure you just have to read it like four times to get your head around it but
it's but it's beautifully written uh it's beautifully written all right uh last subject on ai before we
go to uh other fun subjects uh like neural link and and robots uh i i i added this because i i think one
of the conversations that's not sufficiently being discussed is the power requirements of ai so today
the us has is generating about uh uh four uh terawatt hours terawatt hours per year of energy and if
you look at energy i should have put the the chart on here but if you look at energy uh historically of
the last 20 years and our current predicted growth in energy it's pretty flat the us is not adding more
capacity um at the rate that it should be uh china on the other side of the equation has blown through
the us it's like tripled its total capacity on its way to quadrupling its total capacity india has been
increasing and doubling um and there's a uh there is an estimate that by 2030 uh ai is going to require
a hundred percent of today's u.s energy grid production um ai is a very hungry beast and so
we're going to need some new sources of energy and uh the reason i added this is i think you know
generation four nuclear is one of the most important technologies that's being held back
by public opinion and regulation um i think it's super safe and so china demonstrates first entirely
meltdown proof nuclear reactor um that's you know incredible it's like why not have nuclear energy
right we're going to have fusion eventually got it and solar is on the increase but gen four nuclear that
is fail safe meanings when it when it's fell when it fails it's safely contained i put this in my
backyard how about you what are your thoughts here um i completely agree i think the whole small nuclear
and um milk proof nuclear is the future uh to cover the base load until we generate enough battery storage
there where solar can take over and other things um i i think what i find powerful framing here is the
same conversation that's happening in bitcoin where people go oh my god bitcoin consumes the energy
that portugal uses and therefore we should shut it down and what's happening is we're finding all
sorts of like for example if you have a hydroelectric dam in the far north of quebec it takes so long for
the transmission thing you've lost the energy by the time you get it to anywhere useful therefore the
data the hydroelectric dams it's empty however now you can put a bitcoin facility next to it
and essentially turn that energy into something useful and about six months ago we crossed 50
bitcoin mining by renewables and the next marginal 50 will be just the next chunk will be all renewables
i think the same thing happened with ai we'll start putting ai data centers in the far reaches of
wherever they're right yeah a month ago i was in kazakhstan and there's a there's a valley in the
east of kazakhstan where the wind just flows and they put a gigawatt wind farm there it's so far it's
not that useful for anything but an ai data center and a bitcoin mining thing beautiful so i think the
when we think about the fact that we have what 8 000 times more energy hitting the earth than we use
we'll just start tapping into that to do all this empower all the other stuff so i don't worry about
energy at all well i worry about it in the us if it becomes the limiting factor for the us being able to
stay ahead in the energy and the ai race i also worry about it where if it's easier for large companies
to build coal plants or natural gas plants um because they're not going to stop right this is an all-out
ai war and in microsoft and google and and meta they're all going to be uh just buying as much energy as
they possibly can and uh if the answer because of regulation and because of ease of paperwork is
you know god forbid carbon producing then you got a problem i think the way the root commentary you're
making is the the regulators in the us need to take a very bold move here wake up regulators i think i
think that's absolutely correct everybody i want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a
company that's very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone
that you love company is called fountain life and it's a company i started years ago with tony robbins
and a group of very talented physicians you know most of us don't actually know what's going on
inside our body we're all optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side you go to the
physician in the emergency room and they say listen i'm sorry to tell you this but you have
this stage three or four going on and you know it didn't start that morning it probably was a
problem that's been going on for some time but because we never look we don't find out so what
we built at fountain life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers we have four across the
us today and we're building 20 around the world these centers give you a full body mri a brain a brain
vasculature an ai enabled coronary ct looking for soft plaque dexa scan a grail blood cancer test a
full executive blood workup it's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive 150 gigabytes of data that
then go to our ais and our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning when it's solvable you're
going to find out eventually you might as well find out when you can take action found life also has an
entire side of therapeutics we look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can
add 10 20 healthy years to your life and we provide them to you at our centers so if this is of interest
to you please go and check it out go to fountainlife.com backslash peter when tony and i wrote our new york
times bestseller life force we had 30 000 people reached out to us for fountain life memberships you go to
fountainlife.com backslash peter will put you to the top of the list really it's something that is
for me one of the most important things i offer my entire family the ceos of my companies my friends
it's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans go to fountainlife.com backslash peter
it's one of the most important things i can offer to you as one of my listeners all right let's go back
to our episode all right let's go to one of our favorite subjects in yours uh bitcoin news um you
know do you still i mean listen i remember you and i are on stage at an x prize event uh a few months ago
and like every other word was like buy bitcoin buy bitcoin now we're not giving financial advice but
buy bitcoin uh this one morgan stanley tells wealth advisors they can pitch bitcoin etfs in a first for a
bank big bank uh fascinating right i wanted my mom who's 88 hi mom good to see you um she watches our
podcast here and i said like you know go tell your your uh you know investment advisor to buy this etf
i mean etfs were made so that it's super easy to own bitcoin and back when we were talking about this
i don't know when it was uh uh when i was talking to her about this eight months ago it was like no we
can't we can't sell you that and like huh that's so strange now it's going to be pushed thoughts uh
totally agree i gave a i gave a talk to one of the biggest financial planning groups in the world that
has about 10 000 financial advisors i was like so what's your bitcoin strategy and they're like oh
we don't allow our financial advisors to talk about bitcoin to their clients at all and the financial
advisors are like are you kidding the our clients are asking us about bitcoin and we're not allowed to
answer you're killing us um why because the regulatory risk they have of they're worried
that if somebody gives financial advice on bitcoin and it's not an approved method of any kind by
whatever they face legal exposure so they've shut down that conversation again going back to mindset
and regulatory similar to the nuclear conversation i think there's an underlying driver here that just
makes this inexorable which is the fact that jeff booth's observation that um he wrote a book called
the price of tomorrow that you should all go read and he in the book he basically shows that over the
last 50 years every dollar increase in global gdp has come from a with a four dollar increase in
global debt so we're growing the global economy with debt and you can't it's structural you can't
pay it back you can't just write it off yeah so that that does not end well it does not end well
and look at the debt in the us right now we're creating a trillion dollars of debt every hundred days or so
um and we're now paying more interest on the u.s debt um than we than the u.s spends on its military
okay that is a pretty ridiculous comment and it's not slowing down there's no mechanism this is the
problem with our democracies there's no mechanism to look down the line and go hey we got to stop
doing this uh and so this is a huge issue across parties and nobody's looking at it you don't hear it
mentioned in the in the in the political debates at all and this is a massive problem the escape hatch
between uh that world and the etfs connecting to bitcoin now gives a uh a kind of an atomic bomb
lifeline and a shelter where people can escape through that into the bitcoin world which is why
we're all so optimistic about bitcoin uh the the recent drop by the way for people that are tracking it
there's a huge drop it turned out germany sold a massive chunk at the same time that mount gox
was paying back a bunch of their folks and it was so a huge amount of bitcoin got liquidated
this is the best buying opportunity ever i remember michael sailor's comment that you get bitcoin at the
price you deserve yes really and salim you know i want to give you credit here because you're on the
stage i i can physically i just so in detail remember you at our uh singularity executive
program uh 2012 uh thereabouts you're on stage to the to the room you know i just gotten off talking
about six d's or whatever and you step on you say have you heard about this thing called bitcoin
and you start talking about bitcoin i'm like what the hell is this bitcoin you know we we have um uh
it's important to look back at the history here just for a second when bitcoin came out in 2009
a lot of people kind of just ignored it even though they were deeply um excited about digital
currencies why because there'd been so many attempts in the past that it failed right yeah and so they
everybody watched for a while myself included uh i've watched bitcoin go for five cents of bitcoin to
50 cents of bitcoin to five dollars of bitcoin to fifty dollars of bitcoin and how much higher could it
possibly go yeah and then at 500 bitcoin it's a hard emotional choice to make when you knew it was
five cents bitcoin that's a really big uh thing to cross and yeah i remember finally buying a few at
that at that level um the the uh there are two types of people that come up to me from those days
the ones that listened and bought bitcoin and they're hugely grateful and the ones are like
should i wish i'd listened and bought bitcoin it was completely binary around that so i think there's
there's uh this is just one of those things where you i think the way michael saylor put it was really
best he said go spend 100 hours researching bitcoin and then if you don't like it come back to me with
some salient points and we'll have a conversation yeah so and nobody does you know it's interesting i
look at one of my largest holdings um if not the largest uh holding outside of real estate is is
bitcoin and so when it drops from seventy thousand dollars to fifty thousand dollars you know first
reaction of the amygdala and the animal brain is holy run and hide right and yeah and there's got to
be a judo move here for those who are bitcoin believers to say oh my god time to buy right and so
sailor is there and um you know i think i'm there at this point too uh you know i was a great there's
a great meme um uh of a cartoon where someone said you know dad was it true that bitcoin was below a
hundred thousand dollars in your day you know that's that's wonderful yeah i actually look forward with
glee when it drops because i'm thinking i could buy some more i just don't have any spare cash to do that
but but i do get this burst of oh my god i wish i could buy some more so the big news here has been
uh a conversation by at least two of the three presidential candidates about the idea of holding
bitcoin and treasury of the united states let alone what micro strategies is doing is putting bitcoin in
treasury for its stock which has played incredibly well right micro strategies is you know one of the top
performing stocks in the s p um do you know so we've talked about this right there's six d's you
know when you digitize something uh it's deceptive and then disruptive it dematerializes demonetizes
democratizes and uh the phases of bitcoin it went from the early entrepreneur to you know uh high-end
entrepreneurs uh to institutions and you know will we see governments uh so what's your prediction on
when a we're seeing governments right now but when the u.s might do this i think i don't know about the
u.s just because the the the u.s dollar is so fundamentally important to u.s hegemony around the
world that making a major move in bitcoin would would have a huge impact on the dollar maybe stabilizing it
uh maybe maybe people have confidence that i think it's one powerful way for the u.s to deal with its
debt is to just hedge it but if i was the u.s i'd do it quietly and not talk about it because that and
that's what i think is happening right now i think what's happening is you you have to recognize that
after micro strategies and after el salvador took on bitcoin as its reserve currency that every cfo in
the world of a public company and every uh um sovereign wealth fund is looking at this going
huh i need to be thinking that taking down into account and for those of us that are bullish on
bitcoin if one percent of the fortune 1000 put one percent of their treasury into bitcoin that would
make it the same price of as the price of gold which is roughly a million dollars of bitcoin so yeah
if you do the math the more the adoption takes place and note that in 15 years now people have
not figured out a way of hacking bitcoin right um the satoshi wallet has 60 billion dollars worth of
bitcoin and you've got to see the you think there's a lot of people trying to get into that wallet and
nobody's managed it yeah there's you know it's it's the greatest treasure hunt ever um i i don't think
it's any technology risk uh and i am you know at 99.99 surety but the only question becomes is there
political risk right i remember having a conversation with an a minister from a foreign nation having
dinner with i wouldn't say who it was and they're like your government really wants to shut down bitcoin
i mean in terms of this current administration right so against learn all of that i won't talk more
about it but um uh i can answer that very easily please it goes back to if you shut down bitcoin
you know when i send you bitcoin i'm sending you a string of text and numbers how you interpret that
string of text and numbers is up to you so it turns out in the u.s specifically bitcoin is protected by
first amendment there's a strong legal case around this there's a great anecdote around pgp if you know
that story yeah right should i recount that for folks uh up to you i mean it's really it's really
important one especially if you think about bitcoin in the u.s so pretty good privacy was an email
encryption that was invented in the in the late 90s if i remember right and um the u.s uh department
defense desperately tried to stop the propagation of pgp into the world because then they wouldn't be
able to read emails globally um which of course they wanted to do um and the pgp creators were like
well everybody should have this why should it just be restricted this so the dod put a a full
restriction saying itar regulations you are absolutely forbidden to export this so they
looked at this and said huh okay what do we do so what they did was they printed the source code for
pgp onto pieces onto paper faxed it to the uk which then ocr'd the code and were able to recreate
bitcoin department defense took them to court and the and the court said first amendment pal you can't
stop people from extracting opinion so there's a really strong precedent on first amendment and then
property rights anywhere that has property rights you cannot stop bitcoin from propagating so there's
some very compelling arguments to especially in the u.s but globally anywhere where you have property
rights of any reasonable level you won't be able to stop it you're trying to slow it down
on ramps off ramps etc but they're not going to be able to stop it i just did a a great another
podcast with bill bar height uh head of abra um which again people go listen to it it's that's you
know how where i hold my bitcoin where do you hold your bitcoin right now uh i do self uh custodial
on a stick and a few other metrics does your like do you do you pucker really hard when you pull out
that stick to go and do something with it well it's it's really what you do with the keywords and how
do you secure those yeah because the stick is is thing but well you know this is this is what the
great thing about capitalism right safe custodial models like apra will appear and people move to a
swan is another one that's really good at this so there'll be a whole bunch of there's so much
economic incentive for helping people with that problem the equivalent of a digital bank safety
deposit box is a really powerful one do you want to give your non-financial advice that you gave at
x-prize here which was oh uh non-financial advice would be take 10 of your net worth uh at the minimum
and put it into bitcoin and close your eyes for 10 years if you can is it true that you pulled out
a mortgage on your house and bought bought bitcoin well we sold the house yeah and my condition with
lily to selling the house so i want to be able to put a big chunk of that into bitcoin so uh bitcoin
is almost about the equivalent of my real estate holdings yeah all right uh i'm excited for us to
keep this conversation in future months let's talk about neural link news um elon has his second implant
and it talks about human ai comps and this is one of the conversations that took place a little bit at
abundance the past year is about the idea that if ai and humans are going to link up or will ai take
off without humans let's listen to uh to elon for a moment the long-term aspiration of neural link is to
improve the ai human symbiosis by increasing the the bandwidth of the communication because if even
if in the most benign scenario of ai you have to consider that the edge is simply going to get bored
waiting for you to spit out a few words i mean if the ai can communicate at terabits per second and
you're communicating at you know bits per second yeah it's like towing a tree okay so first of all
if we can communicate at you know at kilobits per second or megabits per second and it's communicating
at terabits per second it's still gonna get bored um do you remember the movie her i just re-watched it
and there's a point at which the uh uh the star of the movie is talking to uh to his ai and uh he
finally gets the idea that it's not a uh monogamous relationship and he goes how many people are you
talking to you right now and she goes um 8736 or something like that and i find that fascinating well
this is the whole bandwidth issue right i think that movie if you haven't watched the movie her
h-e-r please do go do go watch it it's probably the best framing we've seen on the realistic outcome
of ai uh because hollywood tends to always portrayed as the matrix the terminator uh the the whatever and
the robot overlords trick over the world and if you're lucky you're pets and if we're unlucky we're
food it always goes that way and but the reality is much more likely that an ai evolves so quickly
past us they look at us as ants and go you know your little one liter brain in your head uh vitalik
accepted is not just not interesting enough to to talk to i'm talking to millions of ais in parallel
and it takes up it goes it just have a nice life it just it just ignores life thanks for all the fish
thanks for all the fish and i think that's the most likely outcome which i'm kind of okay with you
you know if that's the progression of life uh that's kind of okay but i think what elon is doing
around this is really really important and the the next conversation around bandwidth is critical
yeah i mean right now we communicate uh when you and i are speaking um what what is it bits per uh
per second is it is it for a second bps yeah no i know but it's like oh it's like it's like in
single digits i mean four bits per second yeah it's it's not a lot and and you think about the
megabits and gigabits that we have on our networks there's no comparison yeah so uh here we go uh
think about this you're typing on a keyboard right i mean it's literally that's about as fast as we can
do it is there's not a lot of bits per second um and it's shockingly slow uh let's hear elon about uh
making it faster years it's going to be gigantic um because we'll increase the number of electrodes
dramatically um we'll improve the signal processing so you know we with with uh even with only roughly
i don't know 10 15 percent of the electrodes working with uh with nolan with our first patient
we're able to get to achieve a bits per second that's twice the world record so i think we'll
start we'll start like vastly exceeding the world record by orders of magnitude in the years come
so it's like getting to i don't know 100 bits per second thousand you know maybe maybe if you're
like five years from now we might be at a megabit like faster than any human could possibly communicate
uh by typing or speaking um obviously if we i find that compelling right i mean i want as much
as possible uh so let me ask you the question here salim um they open up neural links to the general
public uh are you are you like get me one baby as soon as possible no um you're not no i'll tell you
why so i go back to the so i'll tell you why i'm incredibly excited about this and i'm why i'm like
okay okay come on let's i mean you don't have to shave your head they could just go straight in
um the the usb port on the side of the head is you know that's that kind of old dream
i think the the reason that it requires physical intervention is a tough one because our phones
evolve much faster than any implant would evolve if you put it in right so there's that uh you'd have
to have this like deep thing going into your brain which is fine once it gets to i just don't
want to be the first test subject uh in that in that model but i didn't say a test subject i said
it's you know the fda has approved it it's commercially available now are you going to get
one i i would wait a little i'm always weirdly i'm a late adopter in new hack new technologies i'm
always two two phones behind everybody else just because i'm i'm i use it so materially that i can't
afford to be at the bleeding edge and have some stuff and work or lose things etc so that's just me
personally but the i think why i'm excited and why i'm on this i'm incredibly excited at the general
conversation of increasing output of the human brain that's a really powerful framing and i think
it's i love the first principle thinking that elon brings to the table on any of these conversations
that brings everybody's thinking up to that level and then you have to think in that way and it's the
fact that he's without realizing it coaching tens of millions of entrepreneurs around the world
to think in this way because he does is incredibly exciting for the future here's where i get a
little bit more if you think about it he kind of makes this comment in this clip that we put out x
amount of roughly a bit per per second is our output if you average it across today but you know we just
talked about why in person is so important because when you're in person face to face with somebody
there's a ton more happening than just my communication patterns back and forth there's the
pheromones we're putting out there's our body language there's visual cues there's all sorts of
verbal tonality that goes along there's a ton of bandwidth occurring between two people uh on a
conversation much much more than just the pure bits per second being output but you know you know as
well as i do that all of that information is being converted to neuronal signals it is and your brain is
only able to process a small number so as we're having this conversation you know there's traffic
noise going on outside there's air conditioning comes on and we don't notice that because i'm
focused on the wisdom that salim ismail is is uh speaking to me about right now yes and so there's
no there's no reason why uh in fact an ai can't actually pay attention to all of it agree do pre do
pre-processing and share with me the most inform important information because i'm ignoring 99.9
of the information coming to me right now and yeah i i have an attention focus on what i think is
important and it may not actually be important or there may be other important information that i'm
missing my my point is that we have all sorts of mechanisms to do that for us in many cases so i'll
give you a small example um you and i both follow a few thousand people on twitter or x and then those
folks we found curate the information out on the web and news stories and breaking tech news in a
powerful way and that's it pre it's that's a pre-processing it filters it down for us right so we do
a pretty good job of that and ai would do an incrementally better job but not a game-changing
better job at that um if i'm sitting in front of a person all the signals that i get are are useful
about the world but it's not you know the the fact that any i might be able to look at the signals of
10 000 people in a room in a big conference and get some sense of that but it's not probably going
to affect my decision making on a moment by moment basis right where i think i let me flip it around
and tell you why i'm excited if you can increase the bandwidth levels and then have brains interfacing
more powerfully the potential i think it'll reshape our brains unbelievably powerfully is a
mechanism for we need a if i had to wave a wand and fix a human being human beings globally as a
species i would basically find a way of cutting out the amygdala right you talk about this it's it's
constantly scanning for bad news and danger and it takes over the rest of the brain and floods it
with cortisol every time it perceives that it's a completely useless device for today's world because
the amount of time we're in actual physical danger is seconds out of a year and so let me give you
let me give you a broad potential to that if we have the ability to to to interact with high bandwidth
we could actually then emphasize the neocortex and and of of more processing power at a rational level
and diminish the impact of the of the the the amygdala on us so end of rant so i agree with you
and we can go broaden that right the amygdala is just your negativity bias where you pay more attention
10 times more attention negative views and positive views but we have all these other cognitive biases
right there's a familiarity bias there is a recency bias all of these things it's like we suffer from
positivity bias we we do we do though i think that's unbiased but that's a different story
um but i imagine you're having ai that's able to uh to tell you listen um that's not actually true
um you have this piece of information from six months ago which countervails that and let me bring
that forward so in other words uh you know human bias alert and we can call a bullshit alert but human
bias alert i think ai could play an incredibly good role because the reason we have cognitive biases
is because the human brain cannot process all the information being thrown at it so we we take these
shortcuts yeah okay so a visual is coming to me okay okay imagine i have a a headset display and i'm
walking around the world doing whatever and i'm buying a a bar of chocolate and an ai is scanning my
brain and constantly bringing up these are the biases you're operating under right now they're the
cognitive biases that are forcing and just having that feedback loop of knowing what biases are at
play at any given point would be incredibly powerful and give me a feedback loop because this is where i
think things become really exciting is the recursive feedback loop when you know what you're thinking
and why you're thinking something that allows you then to reshape how you're thinking this is the whole
basis behind but we're limited and and but we're so limited right now by this you know you know two and a
half kilogram you know unit above 14 watts of power i just i just can't wait to uh to plug in and expand
beyond that but you know that's me i i'm gonna throw one more little thing in this okay okay you know just
you know i've done a lot of mindfulness meditation right vipassana where you sit and you just be aware
of what's happening in your body just imagine that i could be fully aware of all the activity in every cell
in my hands uh right now and i could be fully cognizant the excitement and energy around every
cell in your body which has its own mini mini sub universe 40 trillion cells a billion chemical
reactions per second just that is a profound thought in terms of could i just contemplate that more
profoundly forget interfaces elsewhere etc etc so there's unbelievable without psychedelic drugs
well they give us a shortcut to what's possible and i think there's the the ability to contemplate
a broader with broader bandwidth the unbelievable reality we live in is amazing all right let's go
to elon again on uh on patients outperforming gamers we feel pretty confident that um i think maybe
within the next year or two that someone with a neural link implant will be able to outperform
um a pro gamer nice because the reaction time would be faster you know uh what's fascinating i remember
when i did a uh a long form conversation with elon after we announced the hundred million dollar uh
musk carbon prize i was asking him about the first neural link patient which was a chimp um a mechanic
uh you know it was a chimpanzee um called pager and it was playing pong and uh i said did you play
against pager and he said yes and i said who won uh and uh i think pager won but i think elon may have
said he did i don't know well uh but it's it's fascinating uh that we're gonna get there you know the
olympics are looking at e-sports as an olympic game um and we're gonna you know question is will
you be able to be enhanced when you're playing those games i that will be that'll be fascinating
i mean this is a long trend right which i think you know we have really good evidence today that the
best leadership skills in the world are taught if you play world of warcraft so do you let your son play
world of warcraft not yet because he's i think he's too young he probably plays that stuff without
he plays half of that stuff without telling me anyway um the but i think the opportunity to really
develop a powerful skill deep human skills using this capability is massive i think war you know when
you talk about ai's beating uh the pro gamers etc that's great but i've we've seen that in chess
right and we know the outcome what happens it just changes the day the difference here
is you know again directly from from the neocortex and and these are a lot of these are twitch games a
lot of these are reaction time games right and so when the reaction time is minimized um because
you're going straight you know input output i mean it's you know i i don't know is that cheating
um it is to some extent it's just doing things better and differently gamers spend a ton of money
buying a like a mouse that is connected directly into the motherboard so that they have that few
microseconds advantage um uh for me it's eh for a lot of this but the the general concept of
interacting with the the brain and having a broader bandwidth to process do signal processing is
incredible here's our last slide here and i think this is the numbers folks take away uh so prior to
neural length the world record for a human using a device is somewhere around 4.2 to 4.6 bits per
second um nolan is at 8.5 and we heard elon in a previous video talk about going to megabit you know
when i think about the notion that there's nothing more important um for a company or for a nation
than its cumulative intelligence um right the ability of a company to uh perform its mission
um is a function of you know per capita intelligence i think uh maybe you disagree with that i disagree
with that okay tell me where you come from i i i'm gonna bring out my exo bias here a huge amount has
to do with how it's organized right yeah if you have all of the most powerful let's assume they're
organized identical but one group is more intelligent than the other yeah of course that's going to do
better but but the organization always beats bandwidth um and brain power but okay but both been given a
choice take both here you can you can do both but i think there's so much uh mileage to be gained by
just organizing better and not being top down uh command controlled slow decision making that's
what limits intelligence the for example the basic intelligence in any institution take the nuclear
energy discussion we were having earlier the that limitation is not a function of intelligence
it's a function of the ability to execute and recognize we need a different framework for doing
something and operating from a different model in a different framework yeah but the changing of
models that's hard yeah we just made my point right which is right you know intelligence and regulators
different different conversation different page different motivations it's an it's an it's a
motivational alignment problem more than anything else did you see the movie oppenheimer if you did
did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at los alamos national labs that they spent billions
on bio defense weapons the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their rna
well a company called viome exclusively licensed the technology from los alamos labs to build a platform
that can measure your microbiome and the rna in your blood now viome has a product that i've
personally used for years called full body intelligence which collects a few drops of your blood spit and stool
and can tell you so much about your health they've tested over 700 000 individuals and use their ai
models to deliver members critical health guidance like what foods you should eat what foods you
shouldn't eat as well as your supplements and probiotics your biological age and other deep health
insights and the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar you know as reported in
the american journal of lifestyle medicine after just six months of following biomes recommendations
members reported the following a 36 reduction in depression a 40 reduction in anxiety a 30 reduction
in diabetes and a 48 reduction in ibs listen i've been using viome for three years i know
that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities best of all viome is affordable which is
part of my mission to democratize health if you want to join me on this journey go to viome.com peter
i've asked naveen jain a friend of mine who's the founder and ceo of iome to give my listeners a
special discount you'll find it at viome.com peter let's talk about robotic news next so we could jump
into that all right let's go all right so um so we're seeing a lot uh in the world uh if i think about
the robotics right now we talked about this uh again at the at the abundance summit there are like 30 well
funded humanoid robot companies on the planet um optimus and figure are you know tesla they're
robots called optimus and figure brett adcock's company um just released figure two we'll talk
about that in a minute are the top two in the u.s and there's a whole bunch in china because china
needs um robots um let's listen to a quick note from from elon on the numbers the size of the market
and then we'll talk about uh this in more detail the the optimist numbers like they're really just
they're like so mind-blowing that you're like is this is this real but because i i actually think
the market for humanoid robots is in excess of 10 billion units like more more than the number of
humans um because people each want one and then there'll be others that are involved in industry and
stuff so if they do sell for 20 000 uh that's 200 trillion dollars this is just an insane insane
number that's why i like i wonder what does money even mean at that point you know no how does money
even mean at that point so so uh salim um uh the numbers here to reflect on uh and i i got these exact
same numbers from brett adcock when i did a podcast with him recently uh 20 000 a unit that's what the
price sort of converges on and uh that's like 100 a month if you're going to lease it and uh you know
10 billion of them in the world well i think i again have i like going to the extremes and just
considering both sides of this i think at one level it's incredibly exciting the best framing and
um metaphor of robots comes from the ai conversation with imad where he goes when you have a bunch of
if you're the head chef and you have a bunch of sous chefs organizing everything for you you become way
more creative you execute way faster because i can right now if i had a sous chef ai in the kitchen
and i want to make a really complicated indian recipe um uh i like i spend a huge amount of time
gathering all the freaking ingredients just that would be a huge game changer in terms of my
ability to be a great chef right so i think this is where robots are able to do amazing things uh over
time um i i but i think the entire economics number has become irrelevant just because the change in
productivity is such a game changer i mean none of our numbers in terms of gdp or something can match
what's economics economics are so broken right i mean uh gdp uh is a function of the number of people
working and the amount of technology and the amount of energy they have access to and all those things
and all those things are you know infinitely it's worse than it's worse than it's it's actually
terrible because it doesn't take account deflation so if i we spend half a million dollars per breast
cancer patient in the us on average right if you have the ability to detect breast cancer early and
save all those lives gdp actually goes down so that's not a great gdp is a terrible metric for
success of the human race in the future it's just the best one we've come up with that's easily
measurable uh for the future so this is an important point where technology becomes deflationary
and we have to navigate that for the future but that's again a whole other conversation i'm going to
play this in the background as we're talking about this is uh figure two from uh from a company called
figure ai uh and you know i went and visited his plant and uh and on the podcast with brett he shows
us a little bit inside and it's it's a beautiful uh robot i actually saw uh designs for figure three as
well which take this yet to another level of beauty um and i don't know i i think that uh uh we're gonna
see these every place um uh and and so you know we've had the argument about you said why do they have
to look like humans and i think they're going to look like humans because that's the world we live in
and they are multi-purpose and you know what was my conversation with brett who you know he just
raised like 700 million dollars um uh from open ai and microsoft and nvidia and jeff bezos and
incredibly you know what makes this possible is the multimodal ai where you're going to just talk to
robots and tell them to go do things for you he made a he made a point let me make one other thing
he made a point that i think is really important and i would love your reflection on this the point
that brett made was listen as we head towards agi or digital super intelligence we need robots
otherwise these ais are going to be asking us to do their bidding and that's a pretty pretty depressing
future uh okay so very valid point i still sit on the uh cautious and pessimistic side on this
going back to the autonomous driving mode i'll give you one other triangulation on that which is the
rumba vacuum cleaner robot um people you know everybody got really excited about those and they're
terrible because you have to move everything for you for the robot and now you're doing the work of
the robot which is exactly the point that you just made right everything you do is servicing so the
robot can do and you spend more time rearranging the room so the robot can do its thing than if
you just vacuum the place in the first place but these humanoid robots will will yeah grab the vacuum
cleaner but i think that that those small nuances will take a lot longer to to work in there than we
think where i get really excited about this by the way is the hive mind capability that these robots
robots that i think will be very exciting yeah i'm going to skip the nvidia uh robot slide other than
to say you know every company out there is in some way shape or form uh looking at working with with
robotics uh open ai's got other projects uh google's got its projects and we're going to see robots
you know i just tweeted um that um damn it i posted i tweeted i posted um give me a damn verb be alone
please i i i posted that uh ces this year uh we're going to see a ton of robots but everything is going
to be talking to you right everything is going to be generative ai enabled they can see you and talk to
you and that's going to be just you know sort of uh improvement du jour at ces this year i think it
will be hugely amazing okay i'm if there's not often i kind of feel tempted to go to the chaos and jungle
that is ces but this might be a year to go yeah all right we'll go to our last subject here which is
biotech and other cool stuff uh this was a um article that came out um and uh there's a particular
genetic variation that was found um that increased lifespan in mice um and by 25 percent and uh i think
what makes this interesting is it's actually in human trials as well i i think what i want to point
out by the slide is that we're we're continuing to find things that are extending human lifespan or
extending uh mammalian lifespan uh and that uh we're just at the beginning of this journey
uh it's still early games here how long do you want to live how long do you want to live uh you know
i'm i uh there's a big metaphysical conversation that we don't want to get into here about um living
forever etc etc i i think the best framing is uh having a great health span which you talk about a
lot right is that's a really important one because having a a vibrant life as opposed to just a long life
is really really a key success factor um i think the world is so goddamn amazing i would like to be
around for a while long enough to see this massive transition that we're going through which uh you
know i i say this often i think the next 30 years is going to drive the next several centuries of human
humanity oh i think it's and how do we navigate the mad max versus star trek shooters that we have
uh is going to be really really uh interesting and critical and it's just we you know goes back to
your comment about we must be in a simulation because it's too just too goddamn interesting today
to be around i mean we're at the 99th level of the game i mean to look at it that way right it's like
it would the the we are about to evolve into something new it's like that line from 2001 space odyssey
which i can't remember but uh but it's like you know the future is just unbelievably awe-inspiring
it's the singularity by the way can i ask you a cool question you know ray keeps on holding to the
singularity date of like 2045. i mean that seems like like really if we've got like digital super
intelligence by 2030 don't you think it's going to move a little faster than 2045 you know what's up
so i'm right now plowing through the singularity is nearer yeah i just finished it um and what i'm
struck by as far as i've got into it is a the unbelievable prescience of his commentary from
20 30 40 50 years ago it just blows your mind um who is this man i mean he can't be human to be
making these types of comments uh that's one observation the second observation is i notice he
changes what the singularity is to talk about more as a metaphor than a real thing which i think is
the right way of framing it it's a great metaphor for the fact that we just can't predict past a
certain event horizon and let's just live with the fact that we can't predict but in that in that case
we have we have serial singularities oh i always we always talk about this at singularity university
where there's there's non-stop small s's happening all the time the iphone arriving was a singularity
right uh bitcoin in other words that you couldn't you can call it you couldn't predict you call it
asteroid impacts i call it gutenberg moments there's black swans there's just an increasing frequency of
those happening at an uh at a at a ridiculous level that's going to just change everything we do
and how we do it um going forward and the ability to absorb that and then act on it and then make
sense of it is the biggest intelligence quotient we're going to need we're going to have to have
over the next decade and two yep i i agreed but i mean i think of a a ai singularity uh coming where i
can't predict what's coming after i think that's already there in my open exo world we have a sub
community of about 600 folks focused just on ai and they meet weekly just to try and process what
happened this week in ai and and try and make sense of it i mean it's just it's the i would say that we've
hit the singularity already in ai the pace of change is faster than we can even talk about it or recognize
it and make sense of it yeah i i i get it all right let's go on um i think one of our last slides
here uh life bio is a company that david sinclair had started and you know david made history when he
showed that epigenetic reprogramming using three out of the four yamanaka factors was able to
bring back um the uh earlier state of youth of cells in particular it was in the optic nerve uh
this is uh uh dr sharon i'm not gonna uh rosenweig lipson uh who's the chief science officer uh for
life bio at for david's company it's quick take a quick listen here what we're doing is we're building
on the work of dr david sinclair where he identified that you only need three of the amanaka factors
off4 socks2 and klf4 which allows you to not take us all the way back to a stem cell state but rather
to make a more youthful version of itself so we do it in a in our version of it is an er100 so er100 is a
two vector system okay so we have two vectors and it allows us to use a teton dox inducible system
short short form it means we can control it hoping to be in the clinic in 2025.
so the point here which is pretty amazing is that in the clinic means for humans and we're using
epigenetic you know age reversal in humans in particular i think they're going to be doing it
for uh for a number of uh eye related diseases and blindness reversal but they're in primates right
now and it's working um and i just want people to get excited about the future in terms of uh you know
age slowing stopping perhaps reversing aging and god knows there's a lot of implications i've the
broader implications you know what do we do with pension plans and unemployment benefits you know
all that stuff is is is kind of obstruct the structural changes just coming from life extension
or are unbelievable uh but i'm really really excited about this i i know you spend a huge amount
of your time now on the longevity stuff and you're kind of doing an unbelievable job of
popularizing it and and getting people used to the conversation right i think that's the heart
the key part this is you want to talk about singularities uh breaking through the aging stuff
is something that we've not really been able to do as a human species that in any really meaningful
way for our entire four billion year history of earth and now all of a sudden we're hitting this
point where we can completely change the game of biology it's amazing yeah all right last subject here
for today life on mars so uh we saw some data come back from nasa's uh perseverance rover uh which is
you know cruising around getting data what it did was it found a particular rock that in that rock uh were
three elements that were critical first it found water in the rock second um it found organic compounds that
were part of life and precursors and then it found evidence for chemical energy sources in the rock
and when you have those three things together uh typically that spells life i just saw this morning
an article that uh that they also found liquid water on the surface of mars so you know i'm excited about
two three things number one the notion that i think there is life on mars today
um it's microbial it's subsurface uh it's in the permafrost or in the water um and just finding
life on another planet just changes everything the second thing it does go ahead i say the second thing
is going to be interesting is there is a theory that because mars cooled first because it's farther from
the sun uh that life evolved on mars first and there's an exchange of material between mars and
earth as asteroids um strike the martian surface the ejecta reaches escape velocity and so it's going
to be interesting if we find life on mars and compare it to life on earth did it originate on mars first
and then there's a whole panspermium model which is life you know evolved elsewhere in the universe and
it's just floating through space and it seeds planets as it intersects all right now over to
your wisdom uh well i mean there's no question in my mind of the panspermia model being the real one
because we found tardigrades can survive in space where they should there's absolutely no reason that that
um a light form should be able to survive in space if it originated in earth and yet here we have them
so this was pretty clear that life has evolved and many many many many places it goes to the whole
um drake equation which we don't need to get into right now but if you want to check it out but the
the the the reality of uh life being pervasive around the earth the only then question is what
how do we answer the fermi paradox which i think we have a reasonably good uh response to paradox is
being there must be life all over the goddamn universe why haven't we seen aliens where the hell are
they why haven't they come to bright why haven't they brought me home and the best model of the
answer i've heard is the transcension hypothesis by john smart you get to virtual technology reality
technology and you can simulate anything so you go inward rather than trying to go outward because
it's just too hard physically to go out i do so that reality this is not surprising i'm just
thankful that we've actually found it so that we can shut down all the religious idiots
uh sorry we haven't just to be clear that article doesn't say we found we found the precursors for
it i know but but one of the big questions in everybody i think is where's the primordial
ooze that we think we've seen and here we have it on another planet so by the way little by little
we're filling in the gaps of how life would have started ganymede europa you know the moons around
jupiter and saturn are likely to have even more advanced life you know what's what's fun is we're alive
during this period of time right um starship you know starship flight five is going to be going up
soon can't wait for us to talk about that in our next our next podcast conversation and it is going
to bring people you know 100 people to the surface of moon and mars um and take us out to the outer
planets it's going to be the you know the whatever you want to call it uh what was the trend what was the
most important like the 707 of aircraft right that became the kc-135 tankers and really first
transatlantic really wide body jet it's going to allow us to go there and uh and we're going to find
out and it's i'm going to do a final plug here for x-prize because notice that you're you know you
created x-prize because you noticed that uh lindberg across the atlantic and all the teams competing
developed cancelary technologies that created the commercial aviation industry
right and boom you put a honeypot down in and for the space world and now we have a
close to a trillion dollar space industry and we're doing that non-stop across the board so
the future is so so exciting it is and and i didn't mention in the beginning salim uh salim is
also a member of our board of directors of the x-prize foundation he's godfather to my two kids i'm
going to add your your additional uh uh anyway i love you so much buddy uh and this was a fun conversation
i really really enjoyed it super important and and i want to debate hotly some of the other topics
we'll do that next time yeah and if you're enjoying these conversations with salim and myself
please subscribe let us know i'd like to do this you know once a month where salim and i get together and
and argue and disagree on all of these things salim where do people find you and and your companies
uh at salim ismail uh is on on x twitter and openexo.com yeah all right buddy all right you're
you're off on vacation i'm off to indonesia and india family stuff and then back uh in a couple of
weeks you must be a god when you land in india i mean i i'm you know you're indian and i'm sure
i try and hide actually because i'm scared that once people see that they'll steal my passport and
i won't be able to get that to keep you there all right all right be well take care
