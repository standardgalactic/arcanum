i'm really delighted and and overjoyed actually to be talking to my friend and uh colleague and
fellow thinker in the psychoanalytic vein daniel cho danny cho uh and i'm going to talk to him
today about his his new book genius after psychoanalysis and this is a it's an amazing
book i think first of all and and hopefully our conversation over the next however long will
shed some light on the book and make it make some of his theses clear because i think there are
multiple ideas that he's working out in this book and uh and give you a sense of of why uh just how
exciting it is i think so good to see you danny uh and great to talk to you and for my first
question i guess is uh when i've i've read this book twice so my sense when i read it both times
is that you're trying to democratize the idea of genius and i guess my question for you is is that
a correct uh inference from what you thought you were doing when you wrote the book so maybe you
can use that as an occasion to kind of talk about what you thought what your main driving
thing behind the book was and if i'm totally off base that's that's fine okay so that well first of
all todd thank you so much for interviewing me and thank you for to you and hillary for all the work
you did to get the thing published uh it's not uh an understatement to say that it wouldn't have seen
the light of day it hadn't been for your intervention um but i would say it's interesting that you say it
that way because i think that in some ways i'm trying to make genius more accessible but in other
ways i think it is in some ways less accessible because i link genius to sublimation and while that
means that genius is something that we all have the materials for the basic components for in so far
as sublimation is related to the drive and that's something that's just constitutive of human beings
as such sublimation is a particular formation of the drive and one that freud thinks is actually quite
rare and exceptional when it does occur it's not something that is a structural part of the uh of the
drive um it's a it's a certain kind of orientation towards the drive then so in that sense i think that
in some ways genius is something that's less accessible so i think that it's it's very clear
to me that all of our notions of genius as like iq uh savants you know technology gurus all of that
stuff that's all way off the mark that's so it's very so i am right to think that your book is very
anti-biologist in its sense right like you're trying to de-biologize the idea of genius yes
correct yeah yeah so genius these days are just seen as like uh you know your performance on aptitude
tests and neuroscientists are busy at work or some neuroscientists are busy at work trying to find
where in the brain it is you know what parts of the brain develop into what makes someone a genius
you know back in the old days they thought it was like the size of the brain and things like that
now they think it's you know where the mri shows it none of that is what i'm saying genius is that's
way off the mark but yeah it's so it's not a biolic biological or uh um i would even say not even a
psychological category it's it's it's instead a certain relationship that one has to one's own drive
right like that's that that's basically your yeah your claim i find that just i have to say i found
it completely there's few books i read where i'm i have little quarrels here and there but about about
genius like i just was it's one of those few times where i was just completely convinced you know like
i just feel like you hit on something where you really got at the i've all i'm for one thing i've
never liked it when people use the word like i find like yeah because i always think like okay what
you're saying is this person is sort of out of the bounds of like normal human subjectivity and so
they're they're sort of exceptional and you are saying they're exceptional but what you're saying
is they're not outside the bounds of normal human subjectivity in fact this is like a uh uh well
especially if you're talking about sublimation it's it's it's a vicissitude of normal human subjectivity
even according to freud right yeah i think maybe actually one way so this is not in the book but
you're you're talking about it made me think one way to think about it is
sublimation is maybe the truth of the drive and what we normally engage in according to the pleasure
principle so that's like the the major operating principle that freud thinks normal human beings
typically relate to the drive in some ways the pleasure principle is already a defensive mechanism
to sublimation it's a way to try to re-engage the drive into normal uh capitalistic uh consumerist
comprehensible terms terms that we can manage you know i can manage this idea of the pleasure principle
right i can i can try to limit my exposure to things that stimulate me and i can spend time
you know expending stimuli that are acute accruing inside my body sublimation it is sort of like what
is what is left over after you give up the pleasure principle well it's interesting because the way that
you even talk about the genius's relationship to the pleasure principle i think fits into that right
because you make this distinction between end play i think these are neologisms of you i think right
between end pleasure at least they create a red squiggly line for me when i write on my summary of
your book like end pleasure and for pleasure right like the i know freud says for loosed i i know that
word is a freudian word yeah these are actually freudian terms yeah oh so even end pleasure and
end loose is a freudian term yeah okay yeah um so as as a single obviously so but it's interesting
does anyone else before you made those into made end pleasure one word in english or because i've never
seen that uh no i i don't think so i didn't i didn't intentionally do it to try to create neologisms
but uh it yeah it i just did it to try to avoid hyphenated words but i think right now i like that
i i sorry i i didn't mean to get sidetracked on this because my my point is the way that what you're
saying is this this like the geniuses revout like revolution of the pleasure principle is tied to this
like most people invested in the pleasure principle are invested in the end pleasure that results right
and the genius is is is content almost or or or or or accept is it finds gratification in the for
pleasure right like that's correct that's yeah yeah yeah so one of the you know so one of the basic
ways people understand freud is that like he had like a certain operating idea of what the drive was
and what the psyche was and then 19 uh um 20 came around and he wrote beyond the pleasure principle and
he revolutionized his his drive theory and i guess when i see so end pleasure and for pleasure
are are terms that he introduces in the three essays on the history is uh three essays on the theory of
sexuality which is like uh what 1905 i think 1905 right uh and my claim is actually that there is an
extraordinary continuity between 1905 and 1920 through this figure of for pleasure because if you examine
what he describes by for pleasure that turns out to be the death drive in 1920 at least as far as i see it
so what freud says is that there's two kinds of pleasure one is uh so if you look at people who have sex
uh they they they do all these things for for the end goal of orgasm but freud says along the way
they engage in all these what he calls preparatory acts you know things as simple as like looking at
each other or saying things to each other dressing in certain kinds of clothes and those things in
themselves are pleasurable right but at the same time they increase the tensions in the body that makes
end pleasure much more intense so you're left with this contradictory idea of something being
economically uh uh productive which in freud's normal theory would be considered pain yet it's
experienced as pleasure and that to me seems to be the key to understanding sort of what is going on
when people become genius or when people experience genius it also is key to understanding what happens in
the death drive right some some kind and so he actually warns in uh three essays that uh we should
not engage too much in those preparatory acts or else they have a the ability to usurp the end pleasure
you know and it may be uh you know maybe uh perverts and such like that are people who have
traded in uh for pleasure for end pleasure and i think that again that's sort of like the death drive
right the death drive has this troubling presence that it can usurp you know you can usurp the
direction of the drive uh away from pleasure towards this other kind of pleasure in pain or
this kind of thing beyond the pleasure principle right i mean and then it's interesting what you just
said because in in beyond the pleasure principle toward the i think in the last paragraph he says
it seems that it turns out i think you might even quote this it turns out that the pleasure
principle serve ultimately serves the death drive right which is which would would support i mean
that is a change it seems to me like i think you're right that there is this continuity that i i and
others tend to minimize maybe um but i think that's a point of a change because in three essays he thinks
that's a danger and by beyond the pleasure principle he thinks like that's just probably the way it is
right yeah uh actually even freud himself i think doesn't recognize that there's this continuity
you know for pleasure is a term that he basically drops it only reappears mostly like in his uh writing
on the joke aesthetics you know he talks about there's sort of a for pleasure to the aesthetic
product that sort of draws you in but by and large it's a term that he doesn't really utilize very
much so i think it's something there that he he found maybe too extreme or too some dangerous even
yeah yeah that's that's really interesting so does um that that actually is a good pivot point because
i really wanted i mean the one of the main things i want to talk to you about is about leonardo
because he's your main i think that's your jumping off point for the whole book right is is
leonardo and the contemporary i don't think this critique is still the kind of critique right but the
the contemporary critique of him for abandoning his i mean the claim was you say he abandoned his
artistic genius and got dabbled in science and and your your idea is that freud um freud sees that
no actually this dabbling in science was an extension that was the genius and if he wasn't a genius
he would have kept making beautiful paintings such a fascinating way to think of it because i
think i've always succumbed to the i i was never convinced by freud until i read your book that
this is true i always thought oh it's too bad he kind of turned away he probably could have had a
couple more great paintings in him uh so i i guess like that it is is that artistic genius and then that
g that like that for you is really tied to for pleasure right like that's one of the points that
you're making about about leonardo right yeah yeah so with leonardo and it's right that my so
the whole idea for the book came from when i was reading uh leonardo da vinci and
that book he calls uh leonardo a universal genius and you know no one really reads that book as a
theory of genius but i kind of thought to myself you know if if if if leonardo is a genius according to
freud what kind of theory of of genius is involved in in what's going on in leonardo you know a book
that's you know famous for all kinds of sorts of errors and uh well isn't it interesting that's the
thing it's most famous for it's most famous i think most people who know of freud's reading of
leonardo know that he mistranslates this term for vulture right and then that yeah that causes the
whole that i've seen the mother so it's like freud's own it's like a for them it's like for
the critics of freud it's like a a complete synecdoche for the way in which he imposes the
oedipus complex on everything i think yeah yeah he's sort of more a reflection of freud than it is
of leonardo yeah you know it also tries to explain a lot of leonardo through his uh you know through
his latent homosexuality and you know there's a lot of people who take exception to that and so
there's a lot of reasons not to read the book but i thought myself you know why not read the book to
see if it's true that he's a genius what makes him a genius um and so there is this idea that uh
in in leonardo leonardo da vinci uh is engaged in a project to complete a certain artwork and yet he
engages in these other side ventures that are at first intended to further his understanding of
his ability to create a an accurate or a you know a a realistic painting you know color theory light
theory he's trying to understand how all of these things interact so he can actually create produce
this this artwork then all of a sudden at some point those those side ventures become the ventures
themselves he he rarely comes back to the painting to to the lament of all of his colleagues who think
that his his duty in the world is to be making making paintings and i think that that failure to
complete that failure to reach an end goal the failure to to to achieve end pleasure all of those
things are are the signs of of genius are the locations of genius right and those are that's where
you find him uh producing in the for pleasure like all these preparatory studies he's engaged in in
science eventually then he just abandons art altogether just to achieve just to engage in this
scientific speculation one of the one of the drawings that i i discuss in the book is that
question for a hemisected man and woman which has all these bizarre these bizarre depictions of the
you know it's got like a penis with two two you know uh tubes in it then uh and a breast that's
connected to the uterus and you know all these bizarre abnormalities and i think it's naive to say
that leonardo just didn't know the anatomy of the body i mean this guy was like in in you know in involved
in actual dissections and so he knew the body very well but what was going on what was going on in that
and that drawing i think are sort of all of those all of those excesses those side studies those
things that really are not connected to any kind of angle any kind of usability any kind of utility
and i think that's those excesses are are the expression of genius yeah that's really really good
i think and i i you know just you use the term the duty like his his colleague said you're betraying
the duty of genius and it made me think of so i don't know you i don't know if you know this book
or not but this this writer ray monk wrote a biography it's a great it's probably the best
philosophical biography ever written of ludwig wittgenstein and the subtitle is the duty of
genius and i it made me think like what is like i think you would you say i guess my question it is
like the incompletion of leonardo's project that's the duty of genius whereas the colleagues that wanted
him to like paint a bunch more paintings in the style of leonardo like that would be the betrayal
of the duty of genius and then it made me think like isn't it odd that wittgenstein published one
work in his life and left all of this stuff unpublished too you know like even the great
philosophical investigations the great work of the later wittgenstein is a posthumous work and so i wonder
is there something to that is there something to like this kind of not completing it like i that
seems to me to fit into your theory right yeah i think that's that's exactly the point i think uh
to add another philosophical pair so this is something i never it's not in the book but something
i thought about when i was thinking about these ideas a long time ago this is like back in graduate
school it's like it's also the difference between walter benjamin and theodore adorno yeah you know
walter benjamin we have what we have of benjamin are basically all of these fragments you know these
these non-published these these uh um stray thoughts you know adorno famously thought he was wasting his
time on theology sholom thought he was wasting his time on marxism you know and i think that you know
opposed that you have adorno who was like a professional philosopher you know he he wrote tomes he
wrote essays he wrote you know he was amazingly productive yeah so i think like absolutely i think
there is something about genius that is not utilitarian uh that's you know it i think that's
also why i i hesitate to say that i democratize uh genius because there's so many of us would just
hesitate to want to have that i think it's more of an ethic right it's like something to actually
hold true to because i think a lot of us would shun you know at that kind of a lot of us pathologize
our inability to complete things yeah i mean i it's interesting i mean yeah that's a i that's such
a great that really is helpful for me the adorno benjamin thinks you know when when i don't know it's
about 15 years ago their correspondence got published and i was reading a review of it and it said
and and because benjamin's all of his correspondence adorno's like uh i need some money teddy can you
can and adorno's writing these log philosophical letters and somebody reviews it he goes there's
only one philosopher here and he meant adorno but and and that's and as you say that's probably true
right but but no one i think who's really thinking about it thinks who's the thinker you're more drawn to
it's i mean okay okay there's like adorno people that are but most of us feel like benjamin is a far
more compelling thinker but i have students that are like they we read on the concept of history
and they're like what else should i read by him i really want to dig into a lot of things i'm like
well i mean there's a couple of things but it's not you're going to be disappointed and and i think like
the fact that did he have the final thing finished and then the nazis took it i mean i think like even
that question kind of testifies to the genius dimension right like the the yeah i think it's
such a great example by you maybe uh maybe one way to say it is like uh yeah there's only one
philosopher in those letters but there's also only one genius and only one genius yeah yeah yeah i mean
it's it's if some of the some of some of
and that's not to say that these side ventures are are uninteresting right i think that what's
most fascinating in in leonardo are these bizarre drawings of the of the body um and i think that
what leonardo was trying to do as far as i think what i think freud thought leonardo was trying to do was
he's he's using investigation not to accumulate knowledge to sort of plug up all the holes in our you
know like i don't know if this is when you're in graduate school but like in education you know
they always talk about you do a literature review and then you find the you find the gap in the
literature and then you've your study fills that gap yeah and i think that like one mode of inquiry is
that kind of university discourse plugging in all the holes in our knowledge and i think what what leonardo
is trying to do in those in to put it in lacanian terms he's trying to put a form to the lack in
knowledge as such like this is in the book i i equate this with uh in computer science they use this
term null which doesn't mean zero it just means like there's a lack of data in a certain spot in
the memory of the computer and that puts up this null value you can make excel spreadsheets do this
for example you know like uh and uh and um and i think that what leonardo does in investigation
and in research in his inquiries is he uses he produces objects that that articulate the null of
knowledge not necessarily plug in the zero values of our knowledge and i think that a lot of times when
you read walter benjamin's fragments they have that kind of sensibility to them where they kind of
leave you asking questions not really figuring something out yeah i also don't you think too
that like i was thinking of the pieces on the philosophy of history or on the concept of history
and um the way and this to me is an indication of his genius is that he is able to see and in like
the paul clay painting angelus novus like like the i don't know if you've ever seen the painting but
like benjamin's account of the painting is amazing and then you look at the painting you're like uh
that's it like it's like it's not so it's very disappointing and i think like that's that to me
speaks to the side venture thing you're talking about right like he goes to this thing that's on the
side and yet he's able to see something that probably isn't even there for most people but
it is yeah i think i think precisely the genius locates something that's not there because it's
not there it's it's like in literal terms not there right it's the actual void of the thing right it's
the it's the uh it's the uh the ask the the uh the lack in the object that the the genius is able to
articulate into a form yeah and which i then produces this kind of you know thoughts that go
that go beyond the limit yeah that's really good and i so you mentioned you just mentioned lakon and
and i i thought it was really interesting so i think you think you're more or you've said to me i'm more
freudian than i am lacanian yeah um i think i'm a lacanian freudian than i am a freudian
lacanian right right right but but in this book it's really interesting the way you put those two
into relationship right and i i wonder if you could just say something about that like
what for you because i and it's it's interesting because it's really the lakon of seminar seven i think
that's the the important figure in here i mean i when i when i read this book i was thinking
it's too bad and she was of course the original editor of it was maury rudy and then i thought
it's too bad maury isn't still alive because i think like a lot of the things you say about art
and sublimation and and especially the rest between freud lacan i think really it's it's not surprising
that that she was initially interested in this book because it seems to resonate with her
her thinking quite a bit um but i think she also had this sense of like that that it's and i i
wonder if you think about this thing is true that for you it's the lacan of seminar seven precisely
because of this formulation of das ding and sublimation that's really the valuable part of him
and then like that it's it's and he kind of goes away from that right i mean for sure and and and maybe
but that's what you want to hold on to i think yeah so i know i know there's among lacanians and
i've heard you say this quite a bit of these different periodizations the lacan i guess i'm
not as invested in those periodizations i find things valuable in lacan throughout
out you know like i'm i'm a big seminar 11 guy you know but i'm also a big seminar seven guy it's
also not a mistake that in my graduate school education with ken reinhardt those were the two
seminars that we were really like dug into in my in the in the the seminar that i took with with with uh
with with ken so those are very formative in my understanding of of lacan but it is true that
sublimation is dealt with most i think most explicitly and probably the most thoroughly in seminar seven
for sure and it's in relation to the object whereas when you when you read freud sublimation is always in
relation to the drive yeah the aim of the drive not necessarily to the object of the drive and in fact he
even says you know uh you know it's the uh ancient people you know who really cared about the uh no
the ancient people who cared about the drive and the aim and and it's really modern people who care
about the object in her and so in that sense yeah you quote that that's a footnote from uh the three
theories yeah yeah yeah and i think that look so for me lacan i think supplements freud's theory of
sublimation by investigating the drive in relation to the object and i'm not sure that's quite at the
forefront of lacan's mind there in in that seminar because i know the object is just something that's
very central to his thinking all the way throughout yeah um but yeah certainly there's a there's a
there's something in seminar seven that that deals directly with sublimation in a way that i don't find
in a lot of the other seminars and in freud too right like you think that like lacan adds something
for you to freud's theory and that is precisely i mean it's interesting to me how i think this was
really good and i haven't even seen our our mutual friend i rick boothby i i think he i mean he's a
clearly talks about das ding in every kind of permutation but i'm not sure that he said this that maybe he
has but the way that you say it's this point of non-meaning within the object right like i think
that's really that seemed to me really um like something that that gives us a way to
understand like what lacan can contribute especially in seminar seven to understanding
not just genius but sublimation as well and also the drive right like that that the drive
like what's important for the drive is is precisely this point of non-meaning not the symbolic world
of meaning right yeah so i actually just before i answer that question uh just to say a few words
about maria rudy because she was so central to the book uh she was you know the first editor that really
took me seriously and uh uh i owe a lot to to mari and i know i know that seminar seven and uh and
creativity is very important to her to her and her work and i only had uh short interactions with her
uh at the time when the book was going through review and that was one of the points that she
emphasized with me that that that drew her to the book was this idea you know in in her words she was
saying that you know i'm kind of like rehabilitating old-fashioned terms which is sort of like she kind
of sees herself doing that she told me you know like these old humanist terms that we kind of feel
like they have nothing to do with now you know genius creativity art and things like that and how she
was sort of like rehabilitating she sort of saw the project as sort of doing that so yeah uh um she was
very central to to uh to the to the final form of the book um as far as that about my reading of
das ding that really comes from paying attention to the to the freudian aspect of lacan's theory of
sublimation as he articulates it through the project uh scientific psychology that uh that
freud tries to work through and in there you get this to be clear danny that's that's where the that's
where freud that's where lacan gets das ding from right yes he gets yeah yeah yes and where he gets
that from is this articulation freud has of the object the other people other familiar objects
break down into two pieces one that's a familiar part that we understand we comprehend it we relate
it back to our experience and there's always some other thing you know freud freud just lowercase t
there's just some other thing about the uh about the object that escapes our our ability to know it
fully and that sort of you know that sort of you know goes on to other kinds of things in that book
yeah but uh but lacan elevates that real idea to the thing with a capital t you know there is this
object in the way so the way i i always understand it within those terms which is to say that i understand
das thing to be this aspect of objects that do not comport to our experiences that cannot be
related back to us so i guess it's a very freudian understanding of das thing and i'm not sure other
lacanians see it the same way other lacanians see it more like like destructively and you know like uh
it's the thing that explodes i'm i'm very much for the symbolic order in in the in the book you know it's
but every symbolic order has this null value incorporated within it and the point isn't to explode it
and you know in in you know in exit the symbolic order in some weird you know some weird non non
like mystical way right yeah yeah but the point is is to is to is to hold it in place i think yeah
yeah i i really like that i think again i think that really aligns with how rick views dusting it's
interesting to me that i just want to talk about this capitalization for a minute because it's kind of
funny um so you do not capital when you refer to the thing you do not unlike most people that
this kind of is proof that you're more on the freudian side than looking inside you do not
capitalize the thing and but what's interesting about that is you could argue one could argue
this is just lacan's mistake right because every noun in german is capitalized right so so you can't
like it's like when people translating heidegger capitalize being i'm like okay maybe but you
don't like there's no there's there's no textual warrant for that because you'd also have to
capitalize house and car and everything else yeah if heidegger ever wrote the word car i'm not sure he
ever wrote the word car in his life but um but all those nouns right and so i think that i just find
that a little interesting kind of parentheses that your book does not i don't think it ever does
capitalize except unless you're quoting lacan yeah capitalize i don't i tend to not correct other
people's sentences probably a good policy right yeah so but but i do think i did it does kind of
just i just want to focus on that because it speaks to your point i think that it's this point within
symbolization of the of the null or the not right you said i think you say not not not with a k but just
n-o-t um it's within and not this kind of huge explosive kind of bet and i think that what what
you're what i think a lot of lacanian like celebration of seminar seven is this kind of
betai influenced blow everything up you know encounter with dust like he even has that chapter
remember i think it's on sod where he says that there's always the possibility of blowing everything
up and starting over again right and that's and he think and he even theorizes death drive
kind of in like his theories of death drive in seminar seven is a little wacky i think right like
so so so so i do think i really like the way you turn that emphasis to the to the small t right to as
this point within the symbolization yeah i guess it's my reading or understanding you know maybe it's safe to
say that dusting has a capacity for that kind of explosive deteriorating kind of reading yeah um and
maybe you know uh maybe that's true in in actual reality but i'm more interested in the quotidian
aspect of the of dusting you know there's a i use a couple of examples from bruce fink there of like
of of his failure to relate to his patients which he these are not scandalous these are bruce fink
writes about this himself yeah but it's it's a mistake to think that we can always approach other
people in very familiar terms you know you know like uh oh todd you're uh you know you're a leftist
like i am so you definitely feel this way about that you know i mean and i think that we have this
tendency to to obliterate this otherness within the other uh to turn a deaf ear to it and i think that
that what genius does is is create objects that somehow articulate that thing you know that the
the example from lacan is is is macaroni you know there's a he it's a it's a it's a nothing surrounded
by pasta right right right uh and i think that you don't you don't what you don't get mad you don't
get pasta by just exploding that nothing into nothing right right so i think it's you need the
material yeah it it it it what it makes us do is it makes us pay attention to what is maybe you know
in religious terms sacred about the other thing by by putting some kind of form on it you know that the
example i use in the book is my experience at the grand canyon you know like there's like three kinds
of reactions to the grand canyon you can have one is you go there you go it's a big hole in the ground
that was my dad's my dad's reaction to grand canyon and then there's the the other the snooty the snooty
reaction like i experienced something spiritual at the grand canyon that these other uh rv driving
campers just don't get you know they're buying their souvenirs they don't they're not you know in
tune with the nature of the thing and then i think the third is is where you give up that you give up
that even that position where you you get to see what is remarkable about about the grand canyon is
precisely that it is a void that there is some kind of otherness to it that prevents me from finding
some kind of self-satisfaction some kind of completion to myself my own you know my own leftist
green tendencies find completion you know that there's something resistant even to that which
makes the grand canyon itself and then i think that that may be what kant is calling the sublime you know
or you know that sort of relationship to something that you kind of can't reincorporate into yourself
yeah i really like the way you link that to dusting i think that's really important although i would say
there's a fourth reaction to the grand canyon which would be falling in which would be why it's why
i've never gone because that's what i terrified i don't know fall to my death um so so i want a couple
i want to bring up a couple other uh your own personal examples because i found them really
compelling so one of them is i i too work i work crossword puzzles compulsively right uh and i thought
what you said about the crossword puzzles a really interesting explanation both of genius and of the
drive i think it's a really great example actually um can you just talk about that a little bit like
what maybe what drew you to it as an example like your your example is that the crossword puzzle it it
like we we need a certain level of frustration that if a crossword puzzle is too easy we toss it out if
it's too hard we toss it out right so there's a certain has to have a certain and it's interesting
because the times i don't i don't know if you know this but the times like monday too they get
increasingly difficult monday yeah and so jennifer friedlander and i used to always say like it's it
sucks because wednesday is too easy and then thursday is this weird thing where they there's like two
letters in each box or it's all kind of it's always a weird thing but then friday is too hard so we were
always we always felt like we're there there was never a perfect thing uh since then i've i've i
don't know her status but that was about 10 years ago i i i now now i only find this is going to be
interesting because i i think i'm a little different on you about this so that'll so now i like crosswords
that are actually too hard for me like i like i like ones i if i can solve like one in i don't know
four that's pretty that's pretty good and so i also like to i don't know if you ever play these
games like cinematrix or like movie grid where they have like actors you got to line them up with
certain movies again like i can get maybe one in ten right like and then so that's very few but your
point is uh i need more success than that to stay interested right like so i'm a little curious about that
question so first of all tell me why the crossword puzzle why it compelled you and then and then
i don't have any explanation for why it compelled me it probably was just the example that came to my
mind through free association when i was trying to think about this relationship between for pleasure
and pleasure yeah i think i i think that i i'm not i'm not i'm not the as my kids would say i'm not
glazing you to say that i think we can articulate genius here in these terms like you you are a
genius and i am not because i need success you know i and in it and many times if it was just too
hard that paper just went into the recycling bin you know um but i think that where where i i i sense a
note of genius in the way you're describing it because i think in the way you're describing your
relationship to the uh the work the crossword puzzles you're more you're more drawn to the
failure yeah what what keeps you going isn't the success that you get right it's actually that you
can't succeed at it and it and it leads to these more drawn out periods the suspension and and and
those are the parts where you know you start to like think about maybe what are all the different
possibilities you know like in education there's such an emphasis on trying to make kids feel
successful and in in their studies you know that's what all retention graduation all of that is tied to
how successful they feel in the classroom and so there's always this kind of downward pressure to
to make things not as difficult and i think that's the exact opposite i think what what what what keeps
people coming back to class is that they didn't quite get it there's something there that that that's
under their skin that they don't you know i think maybe professors and teachers don't try hard enough
to get under the skin of their other students but once you get under the skin of the students
it doesn't really it's not really the success and the knowledge that you impart to them that keeps
them going it's when you when they sense you have a question and when they sense it's really alive
this kind of theorizing and thinking and that they can kind of engage in it and i think that's sort of
like what's going on in the crossword puzzle yeah so for ordinary people like me you you have two
experiences of crossword puzzles either they're too difficult or they're too easy in any case you
don't want to go on with them the other thing that i think crossword puzzles illustrate too is that
for freud the pleasure comes to the drive through the finding of an object not through having an object
yeah and and once you solve a crossword puzzle you don't like hold on to it and like you put it in
the recycling bin yeah yeah yeah you do right yeah yeah so it's always the finding and if and if and if
according to the pleasure principle if there's ever too much difficulty in finding then then it becomes
a source of unpleasure and you avoid it whereas in sublimation that unfinding that failure to find
is what starts to draw you into it because that produces for pleasure yeah it's into god that's so i just
think what you just said is so smart but let me just try to riff off it a little bit and ask another
question but um so so it is isn't this why i mean the crossword puzzle is such a great example because
you would never you wouldn't even show your like if i do if i solve a really hard one i don't show hillary
and go oh like what i did she doesn't care at all right like it's not it's completely about whereas
i think you would agree with me like with a book it's a little kind of cheating right because there
is of course the like in a lot of for pleasure in the trap in the work on the book right in the work
but then the problem is that you get all this end play like the book comes to you you feel and then you
a lot of people you send it out to them and so or they they buy it and they they write you and
they're like wow you know maybe after we talk you know a thousand people will read your book and they'll
write you and you'll you'll be like bombarded and that'll be great but in a way that kind of is cheating
on the the for pleasure right like it's a way to kind of it's a it's a that's not like that's not what
the genius is is up to and i think that's really interesting for what what the implications of that are
right yeah actually it kind of made me think about how genius could be articulated maybe in
two kinds maybe like lowercase g and uppercase g or genius as an experience versus genius as a
subjectivity because like one of my guiding lights throughout writing the book was that i'm not a genius
so i could always just relate to myself negatively to like work out the examples right like like how do i
feel about this okay this is not very pleasurable like i i agree with you that writing the book
is writing a book i don't know how it is for someone like you who writes more books than me but like
it's full of a lot of unpleasure sure you know there's just a lot of like frustration
tension trying to the feeling that you're at the edge of saying something but you don't quite know what
it is you're trying to get at and then but my experience with the book is that is that the time
between so when i turned it into the publisher i felt a tremendous sense of relief yeah like in the
classic freudian sense of the tension releasing pleasure friends pure pleasure yeah pleasure pure
pleasure principle so not really in the accolades but just in the completion of the project right and i think
that that made me think like okay so that's clear indication i'm not a genius because i think that
a genius would have just keep prolonging this they would have just literally abandoned the project
when they got close to completion and started a new one you know we know we probably know people
who are like that uh and so i think that but where i think that this idea of of the uh of the completion
um started to touch on genius for me was like when we procrastinate aren't we aren't we precisely trying
to avoid end pleasure when we procrastinate and so maybe there's an experience of genius in the lower
case g for all of us right like we they're like when we people who procrastinate or when we uh when we
you know enjoy failing at something versus succeeding at something when we a side topic brings us and then
i think there are people who that defines them as subjects you know like a walter benjamin leonardo
da vinci those are i would say to some extent even freud because in freud's writings he's never conclusive
he's always and he's always revising right like the project is never done because he's always putting he's
always challenging his own doing his own earlier right i mean freud he's so happy to end the book
with you know we don't have it all worked out you know psychology you know it's just it's just not
there yet you know who really knows if something will happen in the future and change you know all
of our minds you know or you know he publishes a case study like dora which is the complete failure
well isn't why we know about the failures because he tells us his failure isn't that true of every
case study right like isn't that yeah yeah is that the greatest thing about like people i love it when
critics of freud are like all of his cases are failures he published but that's how that's the
greatness of him that he published he doesn't publish the successes because those would be
uninteresting right like he publishes the failures yeah he uh it's funny because the critics say that
if he's a these are failures as if they've discovered something freud freud himself is
telling you here's a case study that's interesting because it didn't work out yeah that's so great
it's such a great point well i i want to end with uh with with the thing that i find really
you know you've said like i'm not a genius and but then you made this distinction genius small
big g and little g um the whole last third of the book really is about or maybe maybe less than that
but is about this idea of like a i don't know politics of genius ethics of genius right like how
does is there a possibility for a group of geniuses right and i think obviously you're you think yes and
you think that that there's a sort of political possibility in that right like like just because
that that that that one might say even that you think the lack and i think this the lack of genius
has derailed politics up till now right like because it's so invested in you know end pleasure really like
so many political projects are i think probably that what unites the left and the right and you know like
my my my son asked me one time you know like why you know why is cons you know why is liberal in
europe i mean the exact opposite and i said well because in in europe uh there's an actual socialist
party you know there's actually they don't they don't think socialism is a bad word so and then my so
henry said to me he's like so so actually in america then we just have like two versions of a capitalist
party and i was like yeah you yeah you got it exactly we don't have a true left here but i think what to
the extent that we have a left i think what unites it with the right is that we're both and they're
both invested in this idea of end pleasure yeah uh and i think that you know it's a it's a poll it's
a politics of non-geniuses i think when it comes to mainstream politics uh we're trying to we're too busy
trying to articulate why it all fails you know and i think that in order to succeed right in order to
succeed i mean that seems like isn't that your critique of the contemporary political i mean
even it's it's a kind of critique of marx i mean you don't mention him but i think it is right like
like marx articulates a vision of ultimate success and you're i mean really you're it's a politics of
like no it's like like there is a like it's it's the striving it's the failure it's that right like
that's yeah that's for you i think it's the politics of the process or the politics of the
of the failure i think you know there's no doubt that we experience failure on some kind of symbolic
level it's inherent to the structure of the symbolic and i think that people on the right want to tell
people those failures are because this particular group of people uh and and i think that when we name
the immigrant as the reason why everything fails in america we obliterate what's actually most other
about the immigrant the the dusting we we claim to know it all about them and i don't and i don't
think that takes a genius to act that way to act like you know it all you know and i think that even on
the left you know when we you know we we narrow it down to one percent of the population but you know
there's still sort of this sense of like it's those damn ceos and those damn billionaires that
have robbed all of our pleasure and if we can just eliminate those people we'll have it all working
perfectly yeah that's really good i i really like the way you form it what's the opposition of seeing
the know-it-all and then the cynic is that right is that am i getting the other one right well there's
the uh there's just the anti-intellectual yeah then there is the know-it-all and then there's the genius
yeah i i really like that way of dividing things up and i think that that figure of the know-it-all
and i think it's interesting because you can even be a leftist know-it-all when you're
when you're when you're like tolerant and like don't want to offend anyone i mean that's kind of
the know-it-all position right like it's an odd way but i think according to your theory it does
that does kind of capture that i think yeah so i think i guess what i would say is like there there
needs to be an element of genius in or in politics so the the last third of the book is is a reflection
on group psychology because there are particular mentions of of terminology that that appears in
group psychology that appear in freud's theory of genius that's sort of what brought me to that idea
but i do think group psychology is the great unfinished project of freud's you know i think
that's sort of where there's so much fruit to be born from from investigating and and thinking
through uh freud's preliminary ideas of you mean just the book just the group psychology analysis
of ego is that yeah the book yeah so the the book is like 1930 is it 1929 1930 29 maybe yeah yeah i think
that's to me that's like the great the great unfinished project yeah i mean it's interesting
because he was thinking about i mean civilization is discontent is 1930 future of illusion is just
before that so he's thinking about like it seems like he's obsessing about groups yes at this time
yeah right and he just can't it's like what he can't i mean one could say i think i'm not sure if this
is totally right but one could say that lacan kind of picks up this group aspect of freud's thought as
he introduces like the importance of the symbolic order importance of the big other and he's really
like that that he kind of picks up the baton more or less success i don't know about the success of it
but it seems like that's at least one thing that people like about lacan is that he he does take up
precisely this aspect of freud that you say freud never fully works out yeah for me
in the book it's seminar 10 that becomes like pretty prominent because yeah he's he has this
line in there where well i don't know exactly what the line is but this idea that we're all objects a
and that's sort of that's that's the universality for all of us is that we're all objects a and so
i think that's how you end the book isn't it like we're it's like a group of objects a right yeah if we
all throw our throw our lot into this idea that we're all objects a you know this this that we are all
the the knots the the the the null of the symbolic it's it's subjectivity itself i think that that may
be an element of you know i know we both don't like that film uh um oppenheimer maybe you you more
totally than i but uh it's utopian in the sense that it shows the form of how great work happens
collective work happens even if it's the destruction of the world you know and i just sometimes i imagine if
we got all the great lacanian thinkers and we put them in some small town in new mexico and force them
to think about group psychology we would come up with like the most fantastic version of uh of group
politics uh you know that would would uh would revolutionize the world it's like that's pretty
great man that's i love that idea but i mean that's a very i know you you you were very indebted to
frederick jameson that's something frederick jameson would say i think try to try to another
person who just dearly departed um that that that you're you're redeeming even the thing that you
don't like by saying look there is this utopian potential in even that right like that i think
that's really good yeah but i think i just thank you so much for talking with me i thought this is
incredibly illuminating for me about the book and i hope for other people and uh i just i can't really
recommend it highly enough i just i i it's one of the few books i've read i mean obviously i've
read hegel and look on more than once but it's one of the few books i've read twice that i i i have to
say i got even more out of it the second time so well thank you so much todd that's a lot of fun
okay take care
