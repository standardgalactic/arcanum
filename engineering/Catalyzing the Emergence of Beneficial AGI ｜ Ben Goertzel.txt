all right let us uh let us get started again so we had a quite interesting uh morning with
the speakers on some uh some different but adjacent topics on brain computer interfacing
and such and this is a it's all part of the convergence of technologies toward a
singularity there's a lot more that that wasn't covered this morning in in that vein in terms of
nanotechnology quantum computing and a whole bunch of other fascinating tech areas all of which are
advancing exponentially and leading toward quite dramatic potentials in the next few years but
now in this session we're gonna
verge back towards some of the things i talked about in my keynote this morning in in the plenary session
regarding decentralized ai networks and building decentralized ai toward artificial general
intelligence artificial super intelligence and and so forth and for for those who are part of the
singularity net team a little repetitious of what i talked about yesterday but it's it's it's hard to
avoid it's the same the same singularity net uh project right and i i want to dig a little bit
deeper into what i alluded to in my my keynote this morning so what i what i talked about this morning was
our quest to move toward artificial
itself perhaps
move toward artificial super intelligence and the ai alliance is pulling together singularity net
fetch ocean kudos pooling our our software and communities together to make a sort of decentralized
infrastructure for ai now there's a bunch of you could get agi to pop out of this decentralized
infrastructure for for ai right and i mean one way which is conceptually is a bunch of people just put
different ais in this network and then agi pops out of their coordinated interactions in a self-organizing
way and i i think that could eventually happen i don't think that's how it's going to happen first
because i think these sort of evolutionary processes are much slower than than than engineering processes
right and what trent is pushing toward with predictor is more of a global brain type approach of like how
do you learn internet or subset of the internet which is processes running on a decentralized agent network
how do you turn that into an intelligent machine by engineering the cooperative interactions
so some of these agents are being predictors some of these agents are be are being traders there might
be advisors that the predictors are traders so it's not just expecting intelligence to randomly
crystallize out of that mass of agents you're creating particular incentive games you're having
particular classes of agents interacting according to these incentive games and then the intelligence
pops out and he's he's starting with predicting crypto finance time series because that's the easy way to
get started right but you could you can then you can then apply it to predicting the weather you can apply
it to predicting supply chains you can apply it to predicting supply chains of software and information
feeding into other software and you then have a sort of global global brain emerging from that
and and predicting and trading architecture so that's
i mean that's all interesting i think it's all possible the approach i think is most promising
and is going to get us there first is none of those so i think all of those can play can play a role
as i alluded to this morning i'm i'm betting on i mean both conceptually and i'm betting singularity net
foundations resources on right like create creating a decentralized agi architecture with a specific design
and this is open cog hyperon design which incorporates lms and other deep neural nets but
in a subordinate rather than central role so i'm i'm thinking make a decentralized hyperon network
which is an agent pursuing goals in its environment in a combination of this environment of many
environments it works toward its goals by a combination of logical reasoning evolutionary learning
various deep neural nets a few other algorithms in the mix it's deployed on a decentralized infrastructure
but then this central ai agent this sort of decentralized hub of the larger decentralized network
can be augmented and aided and accelerated in its intelligence by a whole bunch of other other
agents that that are sort of forming a periphery around it and which can then interact with each other in
complex ways right so i think i think we can get a rich dap ecosystem on the singular idea and asi platform
where the daps are sharing information with each other and they're crystallizing new collective
structures that were not anticipated by any of the authors of the individual daps but i think the way we're
going to seed the formation of this self-organizing dap ecosystem is by coming out with a sort of
singular agi hub which is using open cog hyperon augmented by deep neural nets
to do smart that other systems aren't aren't doing now and wrapped up here is the question of what is the
incentive for ai developers to build products on decentralized networks i mean right now
the incentives are primarily negative incentives right because blockchain networks are slower
more awkward to use and more expensive than conventional sort of web 2 infrastructure just from
from an ai developer's point of view now that's becoming less and less so right things are
web 3 is getting more usable it's getting cheaper it's getting faster on the other hand big tech's web 2
infrastructure is also getting easier to use cheaper and faster and they have so much money behind doing
it it feels like the closest thing to a sure thing we have is launch something smarter and more useful for
many applications happens to be in a decentralized infrastructure then lo and behold we have we have this amazing
decentralized layer that lets us self-organizing emergent mind crystallized from a dap ecosystem right and
the big risk here of course is that we don't actually know how to build something that's
that's much smarter than big tech is offering but but i i believe that we do
i've laid out the case for that for the open cog hyperon approach to agi and a number of other
talks before many of which are available on on youtube i'm not going to try to do it
full justice in the next five minutes or so but i'll
i'll highlight a couple aspects and
if you wanted to start from llms which is not at all where i started in my thinking about agi nor
would i mostly think about what i think about agi but just from a rhetorical perspective start with llms
what are they good at where are they bad at we can see a couple things they're bad at are grounding knowledge
grounding their generations in in reality they're also bad at being creative in a fundamental way
that's not just very shallowly recombining the surface forms that were fed into them
these are tied in with their lack of a coherent model of the world because the coherent model of
the world at least self coherent even if not agreeing with everyone else is key to the more purpose of
creativity that human artists create and and of course the coherent model of the world is what
we use to ground knowledge in in observe facts right so
one thing you can do is try to connect in llm another representation
that contains the coherent model of the world right and this the use of that to help llms hallucinate
less and ground themselves facts is obvious the use for computational creativity is also obvious because
throw out
ideas that are all over the place you need some way to compare them to
reality or else it's just too much right i mean if if you have no way to compare your productions to
reality the result is actually you have to constrain the in in in many contexts so like if if i'm writing
music the fact that i can listen to it and see if it sounds good to me or not is important right and that
that means i can play any random and but if i like how it sounds i won't keep the recording right if i
couldn't listen to how it sounded the low risk thing is just a vary on music that i already know because
the odds are higher that it sounds okay right so by grounding llms in a model of reality embodied for
for example in a knowledge graph you're both giving their fat groundedness and which can drive
multi-step logical reasoning and and you're getting the groundwork for for more radical creativity right
and so that's that's a place to start that part is embodied in the asi create product that nick will
talk about a little bit later but once you're there then you say okay well what's the best way to
leverage these knowledge graphs well you don't just want to suck the information out of them
you want to be able to do reasoning based on them right but then hold on if you want to be able to do
reasoning logical reasoning deductive inductive abductive reasoning based on what's in your knowledge
graph so as to better utilize the knowledge graph within your llm right then okay hold on how do you
control that reasoning right because logical reasoning gives you combinatorial explosions of too many
possible reasoning chains to follow well to control that reasoning maybe you need a way for the system
to focus its attention right maybe you need some little cognitive reasoning control procedures but
then how do you learn those procedures oh you need procedural thing right so if you start with llms
and start with the idea of augmenting them with knowledge graphs which is a very nitty-gritty
sort of commercial property thing to do now step by step you're led into willing to build
a whole cognitive architecture which has all the key elements that a human-like mind has right and
another place to start on the other hand which is more the way i tend to think about agi with my
a researcher head on start with simple systems that are experiencing the world exploring the world
they're being open-ended intelligences they're maintaining their individual boundaries in the
world they're surviving they're also growing and developing and transforming themselves they're
transforming themselves into forms their previous versions wouldn't have even recognized and
this combination of individuation and self-transformation is what weaver called
open-ended intelligence in his peachy thesis and and book of that name an open-ended intelligent agent
freely exploring an environment is a different way to start working toward agi because llms currently are
not that right like they don't know who they are they don't know what their environment is they don't they
literally don't know don't know what they're doing right now we're exploring within the singularity net
ecosystem we're exploring simple experiential learning agents within video game environments
alexei podopov who will be up here soon has done some of this within minecraft barrett cook
patrick hammer and others have done this with another simple 2d game worlds we're expanding that
within the sophiaverse project to larger more complex multi-featured 3d worlds and within the mind
children project as well as in our long-standing partnership with hanson robotics we're exploring
that within humanoid robots living here with us in in our own world right and so taking the
relatively simple software we now have for these experiential learning agents and then extending
it is is another route toward agi which doesn't start with llms at all right and if you look at what
for example barrett cook who who's here in thailand now what he's doing he has a system called iris
which does one shot or a few shot learning from experience so unlike typical neural net reinforcement
learning algorithms i need a lot of examples to learn how to do an action his system needs very few
examples to learn how to do an action by combining symbolic pattern learning with neural learning right
but starting with something like that
if you want to expand it toward an agi well you need to add more long-term memory you need to add
more episodic memory then you need to add more reasoning so so it can extrapolate better from the
patterns i've learned before to new patterns then you need a reasoning engine and and if the that your ai
system is carrying out complex procedures that spend a long period of time right then then you want some
procedure learning method that can bounce together goals over periods of time so in the end the
cognitive architecture we developed in open cog hyperon it appears as the natural
end game from starting with llms plus knowledge graphs as a commercial product
it appears as the natural end game if if you start with experiential learning systems trying to
sort of demonstrate open-ended intelligence as they make their way through simple game world robotic
environments and in either case what we're what we're working toward is a system which is
it's got a large body of knowledge it's got multiple kinds of knowledge represented in an interlinked way and
you could do that in many ways we are representing this in a sort of distributed decentralized knowledge
metagraph now but the the main point of this knowledge metagraph is you're representing declarative
knowledge procedural knowledge sensory knowledge attentional knowledge knowledge about goals you're
representing all these kinds of knowledge in the same meta representational fabric so that they can all
connect to each other and the patterns can be recognized across them right the that's a really
important thing the fact that it's a metagraph is is convenient given the way computers and programming
languages work now so we have this sort of cross modal cross knowledge type knowledge store which in
our case is a knowledge metagraph right and then we're representing not only what's learned about the world
in there we're representing the processes and procedures of thinking in the same knowledge
metagraph right so our logic engine is in there not just the logic rules our procedure learning engine
is in there not just the procedures that are learned visual patterns are in there but also our visual
pattern recognition network can be in there right these are all in this big knowledge metagraph and then
the agi program which does the thinking is just cognitive content inside this knowledge metagraph right and
i mean we put decades of work into how to do all this scale it up to the level that we needed to really
see what we can do right and one of the lessons from the recent successes of transformer neural nets
is taking modest variations on already existing ai algorithms and scaling them up massively and more
data and compute can lead to tremendously superior results right so the the hypothesis underlying our
work in open cog hyperon is by taking this sort of hybrid cross paradigm cross modal knowledge metagraph
based agi architecture and scaling it up massively then we can get massively more exciting results and
we've we've been working on the infrastructure for this for the last couple years we now takes the form
of a structure called the the hyperon atom space which is a knowledge metagraph distributed atom space which
lets you store bits of this across many different machines and coordinate them together and which is
connected to the decentralized infrastructure of of singularity net and and and asi and then a programming
language called meta which is represented as a certain subset of nodes and links within this atom space
this is now a usable thing so we have a bunch of developers within singularity net and some just
interested people within our community who are coding with the the open source alpha version of meta
it works it's not as scalable as we need we have several different overlapping efforts to make it a
million times faster than it is now several of them seem to be going very well in the sense that they can
massively accelerate subsets of the meta languages significant subsets right now it appears that by sometime
early next year we will have a much much faster meta interpreter we'll have it connected to the
distributed adm space and we will then be able to start doing real experiments in scalable proto agi using
hyperon architecture both within the context of the asi create product serving the needs of practical ai
developers who want to improve what their llms are doing in their commercial applications and from the
standpoint of beefing up these simple experiential learning agents that we're doing in in game worlds
and with robots and in in limited environments so this is a quite a fun time to be doing these things
i want to add just one more comment on the blockchain underpinnings of it so we we already have the
infrastructure to run all this on a decentralized network like we can roll this out on a bunch of
nodes running at a bunch of different people's computers and you know we can do that on a network
with no central owner or controller and that it works like singularity net platform has worked for
for a long time so on the other hand we can make this decentralized underpinning better and better
right and one thing that would be interesting will be to scale down our use of the blockchain the way it
works now will be a fairly big chunky open cog system where a big neural net would run on a singularity
net node and then talk to others that's fine would also be interesting if you could have an ai
microservice like i have a little bitty piece of ai code be its its own node running on the blockchain
so then for example if you're using a genetic algorithm instead of having the whole evolving
population of entities trying to optimize a certain objective function running within one container
which is a node on singularity net you could have each element of the evolving population be its own
node living on the blockchain so that the operation of the genetic itself consists of a set of operations
right and that would simply be too expensive to do with singular fetch or any existing ai agent infrastructure
i believe we can we can do that though by leveraging the total ledgerless blockchain invented by
tufi sliba and and dan tolliver and all this is already enough but what we have that's even better and we
discussed at the singular community yesterday is a whole bunch of vertical market specific applications
being pursued by singularity net spin-offs joint ventures partners and other ecosystem companies
which are building software that's ideally geared up to leverage all this to do say longevity
biology in in in in rejuve and and uh perform various ai music operations in jam galaxy and and deep
noise labs and provide ai to generate and and filter and sort between media in in in mindplex and create
digital twins of people as in twin protocol and on and on there's a longer list than i even have time to
give now so we could build this and i can't leave out singularity finance and defy i guess but since i
see nate back there we could simply build hyperon build the decentralized infrastructure and say okay
come build some daps doing amazing things and that will be fine on the other hand
what we have is even better we have a bunch of projects we specifically incubated that already have thought
through how to leverage all this infrastructure to to deliver amazing amazing functionality so it's
a lot of a lot of pieces coming together and while it's a lot actually
it's still not enough right i mean i mean i think it's enough ideas it's enough software architectures but
if you compare our community even after the merger into asi alliance if you compare our community to a single
big tech company obviously we're still very very small not in terms of ideas and inventiveness and and
creativity and goodwill but in terms of amount of money and amount of human beings right so in
order to overcome that deficit now you can overcome that a lot just with with better ideas right but
on the other hand the other ingredient to overcoming that is community right and that's one of the
good things about the blockchain and and token world really i mean there there's a lot of really
annoying and time wasting things about the crypto world which i'm not going to waste your time to tell
you about because most of you have figured them already but but one of the things that is you do have
active communities integrating people from multiple countries and and walks of life aggregating them
together to talk about the same things and work work on the same thing so leveraging the community that we built
around singularity and asi alliance knowing that community is also quite important for following the path
that that i've outlined toward toward general intelligence and it's also important for working
toward the future where that general intelligence is is beneficial and working working toward the broader
the broader human good because to to make agi is one thing and i've outlined the approach i think we can take
there to make agi officials humans and other sentient beings is a is a different thing it needs a number of
things to be done right it needs the architecture for the ai mind
of having a deep i-thou bonding relationship with it with it with another mind and empathizing and
feeling compassion i mean llms don't do that like chat gbt doesn't know who you are it doesn't know who
it is it it is purely transactional it identifies you you objectify it if you're not an idiot anyway
yeah i mean you you want an ai that doesn't objectify you and doesn't drive you to objectify
it but has a profound sort of i thou sharing relationship with you right and so you need
that architecture but you then also need to be applying that architecture to beneficial things like
not only say selling killing spying gambling and plagiarizing and the other the other primary
focuses of the commercial ai industry you need it can do those things people will do it but you
need you need the agi to be dealing with education with with health care with mental health issues
you need it to be helping people in in a positive way and to get there you want to bring in a large
community of developers who understand each of these beneficial applications and have been working
on these things for their lives you also need the ownership and control not to be centralized
in entities with their own very special goals and obsessions which is of course what the decentralized
underpinning is about so we i think we have a community which is decent sized and enthusiastic and
there's there's a couple initiatives to further grow and leverage that community that i'll very briefly
mention and then we'll move on to the next panel so the deep funding program led by jan horlings who's in
the audience is a program for offering tokens to incentivize people to build stuff on singularity net
platform and we can leverage that in a variety of ways there's a call for proposals out there right now
which which which is for developers to propose to implement a bunch of particular kinds of ai within
the hyperon architecture running on singularity net we're also talking about a future call for proposals
just for social benefits stuff built on top of singularity net and so this is a offering people
real money or as real as crypto gets anyway i mean it's offering people tokens that they can use in
exchange for doing stuff for the broader benefit of singularity and the world right and then another
initiative which is newer but i think can become equally important we'll hear about i think in the
final panel today which is the bgi nexus beneficial general intelligence nexus which is trying to pull
together a broad scope of people who aren't necessarily software developers ai developers but want
to give and participate in some other way toward these goals and this this is very important also so
yeah there we go that's the best i could do today in 30 minutes to summarize how we're aiming to build a
decentralized beneficial agi there's a lot of moving parts on on the on the other hand you know these
things get miraculously easier and easier to build and and pull together as we get closer to the
singularity and i think it's entirely possible in this way to pull together a decentralized agi within
the next let us say two to five years i mean there's no guarantee you could always say hidden rocks but i
don't think it's implausible at this point which is quite remarkable and i would say we have in the asi
alliance and singularly net community we have both the most credible and mature decentralized platform
for ai and we have the most credible non-big-tech agi project and the most credible non-deep neural net
approach to agi so we've got a lot of potential here coming together in a nicely integrated way and
at least as importantly we have an amazing group of people cooperating together to make this happen
we will shortly hear from a number of those people
