this episode you know what is space so this is a great question and really the the basis of much
of my work um when we think about space for hegel in particular in the philosophy of nature
he says that space is indifferent it's continuous it's external and so we can kind of break that
down a bit right if space is indifferent that means that this space here is the same as the
space here it's homogeneous right all space is just the same it's once we start to put objects
in it and differentiate those objects based on space that we really produce relations as such
and even logically we think very much spatially in this sort of like web of relations but back to
nature the interesting thing about space is that there is always more space we can never contain
all of space into one bucket let's say right and a really first a very simple reason that there's
something outside the bucket right we can't ever encapsulate everything and totalize everything
this is a really classic paradox this is the paradox of the one in the void that when we
name the void as one ah we've the void that is expansive and endless let's just call it one thing
let's call it the one name everything as such well then we've marked a one against a backdrop of
indeterminacy against a void again so there's this logical indeterminacy that cradles all
determinations so in the same way it's it becomes very evident that when we think about natural space
there has to always be more space and one other way that hegel describes space in the philosophy of
nature is as he says space is side by side it's side by sideness hey everyone welcome to my
conversation with the hegelian philosopher catherine everett firstly let me just get this out of the way
i'm so glad that i connected with catherine and started following her work before she became a world
renowned philosopher and thinker because oh boy let me just say reading her thesis itself was quite the
effort so i can only imagine i can only imagine what a feat it must have been to write the thesis
because it's truly an ambitious project i mean to redefine not redefine but to formulate an ontology of
space using badoui and hegelian jizikian philosophy i can't put into words uh how difficult that must have
been and how ambitious and even audacious it has to be to try and formulate something like that and
i've got to say reading it you know for me as a neophyte i've learned so much uh she kind of reformulates
and then re-articulates some of these existing big names in philosophy especially a carnal philosophy
uh in her thesis which i should probably mention hegel and vertigo and ontology of space
uh it was just it was so interesting i i certainly couldn't get through all of it um but i really
am priming the time to read it a bit more carefully um and again i learned so much as to how these
different thinkers can be brought into this really interdisciplinary work um and also i kind of mentioned
this catherine already you know in carnal philosophy kind of from the lacanian hegelian camp uh where
you really only see zizek uh taking quantum mechanics and all these paradoxes that come from
the world of quantum mechanics and modern physics seriously and philosophizing on it and theorizing
on it and another person i think an up-and-coming thinker would be catherine who's doing that uh she
wrote uh a few pieces on uh the the on the quantum leap uh but also another piece on ai and chat gpt and
i find it's really important for people who work uh in in carnal philosophy kind of from the kind of
hegelian or the kenyan tradition to uh tarry with these questions and kind of bringing this different
toolkit to analyze some of these phenomena we see more typically handled by um analytic philosophy or
a field like cognitive science or artificial intelligence so i don't want to prolong this
introduction too much i am really grateful for catherine for sharing her thesis with me but also
for her time discussing her work um but before we get to the episode of course a quick psa you may be
aware that i've mentioned multiple times i'll never have advertisers or sponsors on this podcast i
don't have anything to sell you and i deeply do believe that we live in a society of excess and
over consumption and i don't want to contribute to that by selling you more things that being
said though forgive the tautology we ultimately live in the world we live in and i can't continue
this project and sustain it if i don't have any kind of financial support so as uncomfortable as
this makes me feel i sincerely would like to ask you to consider supporting this podcast financially
needless to state your listenership and membership is more than enough support however if you have the
means please do consider supporting me on patreon sub stack or even paypal and if you're wondering
what are the perks what are you gonna get nothing absolutely nothing because i'm not selling you
anything you're not buying anything but rather if this podcast if the work i've done has brought you
any kind of value if you've learned something new do consider supporting me on these platforms but to
reiterate only if you have the means all right back to the episode so yeah as i was saying despite the
current economy if you have the means please do consider supporting my work and by doing so you
not only support this podcast and my writing but also my academic research i truly will be grateful
uh be that as it may a quick formal introduction to catherine catherine everett is a hegelian scholar philosopher
writer and artist catherine's a research fellow at the global center for advanced studies in dublin
and a secondary faculty at the brooklyn institute for social research her phd hegel and vertigo an
ontology of space was supervised by frank ruda at the european graduate school reading hegel with
baju and zizek she argues that space is the indifferent ground of logic nature and spirit in hegel's encyclopedia
i should mention this uh catherine did give me permission to share her thesis around so if you
do want her thesis please do email me i'll send it right across alrighty with that being said here's
my conversation with catherine everett well catherine firstly the three main ideas of yours that i was
really drawn towards was undoubtedly your work on space um and then also more of your interest in
uh the philosophy of physics or should i say your interest in quantum mechanics uh outside of
judge you're probably one of the only other people i've seen uh that that are that's really seriously
tackling these questions in quantum mechanics within kind of the hegelian you know the kenyan theory
scene um it's just i mean i i understand because like it can really it can easily lead to the
woo-woo land and it can be a whole bunch of bush i understand why a lot of thinkers are quite uh
wary or circumspective of of you know theorizing quantum mechanics and the other thing of course is
this article you wrote uh does chat gpt enjoy so i'd like to discuss a bit of uh ai kind of your views
on that too um however however i probably should mention this um i know you were on uh cadel's
podcast recently uh philosophy portal which is great i look forward to listening to it and i'll
leave a link to it in the show notes too uh that being said you know uh i i think cadel's audience
the philosophy portal audience are a lot more attuned to german idealism uh concepts you know hegelian
philosophy and other very well knowledgeable in the different uh the tradition itself but also the
different ideas i wouldn't say so about myself nor my audience we're all neophytes and yeah and therefore
it's it's a bit hard to just jump into your thesis straight away without a bit of context i think it'll
kind of make definitely i like just like thrown into you know into something so maybe one one idea
which i've seen underlying all of your work is this notion of incompleteness uh we recently gave a talk
on the idea that reality is incomplete uh so catherine can you can you tell us what do you mean by
reality is incomplete or to use another term by term from zizek uh ontological incompleteness
so what what does this mean and also perhaps why is it necessary to theorize on the uh incompleteness of
reality yeah thank you so much raul it's so great to be here first of all just thank you for having
me on and it's um i feel really lucky to be here and to talk about these cool different i mean things i
think are cool that i like to think about um so yeah let's start with the incompleteness um so the
incompletion of reality for me is intimately tied up with space and the fact that space guarantees
incompletion in a logical sense and in a natural sense so we can break those two pieces down in terms of
nature it's a debate today right that if we were to take a rocket ship to the farthest reaches a space
are we going to hit a wall are we going to hit some sort of curvature um or does space go on and on
infinitely so of course i didn't get into a rocket ship when i thought about this problem um but i
think in just a really basic way when we think about what space is in itself this is insightful for
thinking about the contours of nature so you know what is space so this is a great question and really
the the basis of much of my work um when we think about space for hegel in particular in the philosophy
of nature he says that space is indifferent it's continuous it's external and so we can kind of break
that down a bit right if space is indifferent that means that this space here is the same as the space
here it's homogeneous right all space is just the same it's once we start to put objects in it and
differentiate those objects based on space that we really produce relations as such and even logically
we think very much spatially in this sort of like web of relations but back to nature
the interesting thing about space is that there is always more space we can never contain all of
space into one bucket let's say right and a really first a very simple reason that there's something
outside the bucket right we can't ever encapsulate everything and totalize everything this is a really
classic paradox this is the paradox of the one in the void that when we name the void as one ah we've
the void that is expansive and endless let's just call it one thing let's call it the one name
everything as such well then we've marked a one against a backdrop of indeterminacy against a void
again so there's this logical indeterminacy that cradles all determinations so in the same way it's
becomes very evident that when we think about natural space there has to always be more space
space and one other way that hegel describes space in the philosophy of nature is as he says
space is side by side it's side by sideness which is a really fascinating point as well that there's
always going to be more space next to itself space is already in this way alienated itself from itself
which is a really we can really dig into that it's really interesting but back to incompletion in this
one very basic way right nature is open there's always more space but not simply in the macro level
right like it's not simply that i can keep going and there's more space out there but likewise on
the micro level and this is what you know science has demonstrated to us that i can keep looking at
smaller and smaller things that i can keep splitting things into you know smaller pieces but not even at a
big level or a small level i could keep discovering more things about nature there's more to unfold
constantly i could spend my whole life studying you know plants or staying a particular plant right
city grass my entire life and i would unfold and uncover new things about that so there's a
certain openness and incompletion constitutive not just in our knowledge but of nature itself
and this i think is a real key to a lot of different interesting puzzles right in terms of freedom
right if reality was already complete if things added up in such a way there wouldn't be space
for radically new action for the creation of a new paradigm for freedom as such these are a lot of
big claims that i just made that definitely need some unpacking but this is the the basic way i think i
approached this question of of incompleteness savoy's work uh savoy zizek his work on incompleteness
i think is similar to this but he's really i think looking more at the contradiction implicit in
reality itself which i completely like i'm on the same page with him like i agree with this reading
i'm adding i think to his reading in a sense of thinking just simply about space
yeah beautiful because in fact that was going to be my follow-up question um i had this discussion with
professor todd mcgovern and he he uses um contradiction over uh especially in this book
it's beautiful i love this book so much it's my my favorite books uh emancipation after hegel so for
him contradiction is is it's imminent but it's also in some sense absolute you can't overcome contradiction
you know and so and i was trying to see well i'm assuming you would still uh subscribe to that idea
too that for you you know incompleteness because slavo he he generally uses incompleteness i i rarely
hear him use he uses negativity or incompleteness perhaps on the concepts but for you know professor
mcgovern tom mcgovern it's mostly contradiction so that contradiction and correct me if i'm wrong here
it's something like in in this existing reality as such but also more from like the perspective of
subjective identity or an identity and identity is both itself and not itself like that's kind of the
contradiction it holds so i'm wondering if you could speak a bit more into that notion of contradiction
and perhaps how that differs from kind of your notion of space being this like open the openness of space
yeah this is a great question and i think the way that both that todd and savoy see this problem
is as a void right that is constitutive around any concept or any being that the void is this
contradiction within within a subject within a determinate being and so in this way it's very
spatial right a void is some sort of empty space and for savoy this is what makes any sort of determinate
being incomplete and i think likewise for todd what makes this determinate being in contradiction with
itself right so let's take for example the the example of the subject right that the subject has
something um implicitly lacking within herself right this is the classic kind of lacanian reading
um the split subject is organized around a sort of division right and we can read this in a couple
different ways right i mean from the very classic example of the mirror stage of the child whose ego
um misrecognizes itself in the mirror as the ego ideal there's this necessary gap between the
two that nonetheless fuses to make a subject as such um i mean here's a nice example of just you know
seeing a void or space that is that that is underlying that contradiction that is that contradiction
itself right but there is some gap between this two that makes this not one within the subject
um i think that's one way we can think about this so to take like another example that i think will
elucidate a bit more um for hegel there's and for many of the german idealists this great question about
you know does a equal a does i equal i the sort of like absolute identity question this uh principle of
non-contradiction right um and of course in mathematics we know that you know a equals a
x equals x right we have to like use this axiom to like make math work right but for hegel it's not so
simple right it's not simply that a equals a we have to go through many many steps in the phenomenology
to finally say yes a does equal a i think part partly what hegel's doing with this like infinite
relation between the two a's or between the two eyes that's you know how he describes in terms of
the subject i equals i i am i this infinite relation with the self requires a certain i think this is
very much todd's alley requires a certain alienation from myself right i am myself because i am alienated
from myself my insertion into this is that we need a space for two eyes they have to be spatially
distinct they have to be like there has to be a bare minimum of space in order for the eye to alienate
herself from herself and then to constitute herself as you know some fictionalized unity okay i mean
unity is always fictionalized in this way or there always is some you know kernel or gap or seed of
contradiction within that precisely that i have to point back at myself and say oh yeah that is me
right whether it's the mirror stage or in this master-slave dialectic kind of sense of of alienation
from the self so so this is really like one of the first questions i had when i was reading hegel was
why do we need to have this this bare minimum of space and does this occur in other moments in hegel
right like is this the only example in the master-slave dialectic but um no like the i mean the idea
also needs to do this to itself needs to like self-alienate in order to come back into itself
this is the progression from logic to spirit as well um and again just going back to space what makes this
i think so interesting is that space itself like i mentioned before like contains its own
germ of alienation which was one of the biggest questions i had in my project um taking the very
simple standpoint that okay if space is just indifference if it's just homogeneous right how
does the difference come forth from indifference is this the right relationship to even like pin
together right but one must ask this right like what is the relationship between indifference and
difference so especially in a system that depends so much on negativity on difference as such
how can we paint homogeneity into this and so when hegel describes space in the nature we're still you
know hanging out in the nature right now when we look at the nature and we say well space is next to
itself i thought this was beautiful right that already space is that which is completely indifferent
has self-differentiated is always next to always beside itself just as consciousness is beside itself
if space weren't beside itself i mean a very like obvious way if space weren't next to itself everything
would be at one point right there would be no space right they would just be collapsed we need to have
the spatiality to have difference and even in its own indifference there is this like seed of of
difference that comes forth so yeah i hope that answers the question regarding um yeah there's a lot
of different thoughts there but this is sort of like a riffing on contradiction and incompletion and
why contradiction is part of incompletion and vice versa they're slightly different but i think they
they can hold hands very very well i i think that last bit of the answer the latter bit where you come
it helped me really visualize it the the collapse that makes a lot more sense and also uh a good pithy
way to put this is in your thesis you say that this is in the introduction so right at the start you say
in this text i argue that space is the indeterminacy which grounds determination
and i thought that really captures a lot of the spirit of the of the text um yeah
uh now uh as i said i want to kind of touch on a few more things here so one thing i think we can do
is catherine i i think we may have to jump from different places in this conversation because
uh yeah that's cool i think if i want to discuss your underlying ontology but there are also like
these other more what should i call it uh subtopics or subcategories which we can touch on while we
discuss your underlying ontology and um before that so one thing i want to discuss is the subjectivity
and why yeah and how it relates to this ongoing kind of invoke invoke dialogue or conversation
regarding ai and ag conversations but but before we get to that i think this is quite important to
get to uh vertigo vertigo uh a beautiful concept um i have i have one question just for you to define
what would it go is but also i've got a bit of a question regarding character guard and angst however so
we'll first discuss uh vertigo um yeah so what is vertigo in in your terms in your ontology of space
and has it got anything to do with uh after after hitchhitchcock's uh film vertigo you know i was really
tempted to maybe weave in a bit of hitchcock it's one of my favorite movies of all time you know it's
such a perfect film um yeah i know it's it's really it really is but you know my my thesis doesn't
have anything to do with the with the hitchcock movie but um perhaps it does perhaps it does in
some ways you know i think we probably could extrapolate some ways but i don't explicitly discuss
the film although there probably is some like unconscious childhood like associations right but
i'll leave that to my to my analyst there's a term itself there's something there probably there has to
be there has to be um so vertigo in the really so when most of us think of vertigo we know that vertigo
is the sense of standing on the ledge of a tall building or a cliff we look over the edge and we
want to throw ourselves over right we have this desire to to jump right it frightens us so i definitely
think this is one way to conceive of vertigo but i do think the way that i am conceiving of vertigo
in this paper is that we're gonna actually a confrontation with space itself it's a confrontation
with that emptiness and a desire to overcome that emptiness and to close that gap between you and the
ground right to literally throw yourself over the void and to surmount it so yes there's this idea of
like death like caught up with vertigo but the way it really plays out for me in my text is asking
what happens when we confront emptiness itself well we can we can imagine this right we can imagine like
confronting the void confronting the abyss and we do get this vertiginous feeling right this anxiety
that is produced by vertigo so like the the classic definition of anxiety per lacan is that anxiety is
not without object whereas fear if you're afraid of something there there's an object right like if
i'm afraid of spiders it's spiders really freak me out right that's the object i'm afraid of but anxiety
is when you wake up in the morning and you're like i'm not sure why i'm anxious but i just am right
there's you can't quite pinpoint the object this is what you know drives you uh maybe not crazy but it
bothers you right makes you even more anxious and so i thought this was a really great way to think
about the the impossibility of conceiving of a space in itself right and this impossibility is
really central to to the to my work right that we can't even hegel tells us this that we can't think
of a space in itself a pure space and you know i mean yeah we can maybe think of it for a moment but
immediately you know we're thinking of the contour around that right of like the the delimitation
of that emptiness or we're contrasting that emptiness with something and this is of course
apropos his first pages of the logic when we're asked to think indeterminate being and indeterminate
nothing it's a similar exercise of thinking blankness or thinking that which has no reference
so back to vertigo um if vertigo is thinking space in itself it's not without object in this precise
way right there's an object lacking in thinking space in itself and yet there is sort of an object
there as well right it's it's space but we're trying to think blankness so we're sort of oscillating
between making space an object and thinking about space as just nothingness as such so this is the
the beautiful paradox of space right that it's somewhere between being and non-being as democritus
put it um so how does vertigo then function in my text well when we encounter just this emptiness
in logic in nature and in spirit when we encounter just pure indeterminacy the void
in logic pure space and continuity in nature when we encounter just the empty lack of oneself
these things it's very easy to just fall into them into kind of a give way to almost this nihilistic
there's no ground underneath my feet to reality right but so much of what i work what i worked on was
asking how do we exit that feeling how do we get out of the vertigo right how do we ground ourselves
and the simple answer is like we build the ground out underneath our own feet right like we we choose
a point of orientation we orient ourselves around it this is what i mean even like you know classical
physics will tell us right we have to pick a point of orientation in order to just like start to measure
anything right there is no absolute center of the universe we just pick pick a point right and it's
arbitrary but it's nonetheless um instructive right and we take that arbitrariness at the heart of
knowledge itself right i mean this is back to the idea of like incompletion and contradictions
is another way to see it that i've chosen an arbitrary standpoint this means my logic or my knowledge
is going to be incomplete but there is going to be a contradiction implicit in it but nonetheless
i can still build a logic off of that that can still yield truth and so this is i think the the
question that i was dealing with right is how do we encounter this again like space in itself this
emptiness lack it the void and how do we pull ourselves out of the vertigo in order to like properly
again just orient ourselves and think and like you know step back from the ledge in a sense or rather
like how do we traverse the void right how do we surmount it you know how do we garner the courage to
to reorient in the face of the void yes yes uh yeah it's funny when you were when you were talking
about that you have two two things came to my mind uh regarding yeah arbitrary pick a point it reminded
me in mathematics where they have the axiom of choice uh you know after godel approved to the
incompleteness theorem that you can't have absolutely uh axiomatic system mathematicians
not just pick uh a set theories zemele frankl or whatever the case may be and then they work off that
and then there's knowledge built off that though it's it's effective in the world it's it's yeah it's
also the other thing thought i had was uh i think adrian johnston it beautifully explains it in his new
new german idealism where you know the relationship between uh necessity and contingency i don't know
if this kind of touches on what you're saying where yeah completely sense it's contingent like the act
is content but it normally appears to us as being necessary kind of like falling in love you know for
instance so completely and if all like the contingents even though it's contingent it doesn't make it any
less real it's it's it's a it's a true thing it's a real thing and you you have a life from there um
yeah i see that although catherine i'm gonna be uh i'm gonna hystericize a little bit here i'm gonna
just be the history i still i'm trying to get at how that differs from uh character god's angst i mean
his book the concept of anxiety for me one of the best books i've read because i read it a while but
i was like this guy gets it this is exactly what i'm experiencing in life and because for him it's the
notion is like this dizziness of freedom the openness of space that we can yeah choose to
jump off the cliff or not so yeah if we could juxtapose vertigo with uh character god's angst
yeah are there any any any because i i know i can feel it when i'm reading your work but there's there
is a difference but i just can't articulate it so if you could help me yeah yeah i mean i don't want to
like butcher kierkegaard right but i think the dizziness of freedom for kierkegaard the freedom
as like the possibility of possibility in my view i think it's really intimate i mean it's a really
beautiful idea i completely i love this this whole notion of his i think it's very intimately tied up
with the ability to choose death right that i that i can choose to throw myself over the cliff
right that's what's really that's what really produces the anxiety right less what produces
the anxiety is that i can step back and just keep going about my business as usual right that
with the freedom with doing the really radically different thing whether it's you know throwing
yourself off the cliff or you know joining the revolution or falling in love those things produce
a lot of anxiety because they're outside the contours of our day-to-day right they're they're radical
choices but if i choose not to fall in love not to join the revolution go back to my day-to-day kind of life
this is very comforting right this is this is the normal this is less anxiety inducing so i think
for kierkegaard he's really like that's uh that is like the the dizziness there right is between
the the anxiety of that choice and the comfort of of the day-to-day right and so the way i'm
like deploying vertigo as such is a it's a there's certainly a similarity right i think the distinction
is that the vertigo is is really the attempt to encounter nothingness as nothingness right
potentiality as potentiality less concerned with i'm less concerned with like the day-to-day in this
way right i'm more concerned with just that that abyss of of potentiality that we can't even
in frame in some sense right but in a similar way to kierkegaard right we have to seize that openness and
that that gap right that blankness in order to be free like this is i i this is i think a very a
really similar kind of point right and i take this from badu right that if we're going to have an event
occur right you have to seize upon an intervention upon a crisis upon something that is radically
outside the contours of the day-to-day in order to do yeah sorry it's sort of like a disjuncture you mean
right like yeah like a disjuncture yeah exactly yeah and to like then do something new with this
right and so the only way for there to be this possibility of freedom right is for there to be
some open undetermined space right like the void has to lurk for badu it has to be it has to errantly
appear and we you know we create events we create we create events at a site that is at the edge of the
void for badu so in this way this is more my concern right is that nature of indeterminacy that structures
and allows for freedom only if it can be seized yeah yeah all right perfect beautifully put um yeah
there's a lot there i need to think about that for four days before i really say um so i i'll just say
this i'll just say this um i i wanted to ask you this question regarding now we'll probably go more
into uh the question of physics and science because uh it's interesting i i've seen i've even heard uh
you know some people in the lubliana school uh zapanchik uh marindola that they them commenting on
why they haven't really uh you know thought of theorizing on science much or on yeah contemporary
physics and yeah their answer seems quite reasonable that it's simply that look they just
don't know enough it's just it's just it's even even the ongoing dialogue the contemporary dialogues
in uh the interpretations of quantum mechanics be philosophy of physics uh or quantum loop gravity
and all these they too it's very chaotic there's really no there's no place where you can refer to
as this is like which probably makes sense there's no big other so um yeah but i'm curious as a
philosopher um uh how do you how do you work work with quantum mechanics i mean firstly why do you
think it's necessary for philosophers especially philosophers working in this german idealist tradition
to theorize on quantum mechanics and perhaps contemporary physics uh but how do you find
working through quantum mechanics without being a physicist in the first place like what's that been
like for you it's hard um for me i never thought i was going to go down this path if you told me 10 years
ago even five years ago that i'd be doing research into quantum physics i would laugh but
for me you know i i began with this question of space right and so i had to ask what's the history
of uh of space and obviously it's very scientific question so you know going through the the new
leimnitz debate right on is space absolute or is it relative but such a huge touch point in modernity
um thinking about a queer queer text on a closed world to an infinite universe right this shift in
modernity where the universe became totally open and no longer an enclosed um an enclosed bubble
surrounded by heaven right there are these different sort of touch points that i found incredibly
interesting and then i had to ask like what do people think about space today right and there's i
mean so many interesting theories and there's a definitely not one way to read space in modern science and
quantum mechanics today right i mean for example you know some theorists think that space and time
are eventual consequences of atomistic interactions and this is a really interesting theory to me right
because you know i read badu and so thinking about time and space as consequences of events can
fit really beautifully into his theory right so that that's fascinating to me but likewise i have kind of put my stake
in the ground of seeing space as this indifferent ground to difference so there seems to be some
sort of contradiction there right and so then i have to take a step to take a step back and ask you
know is the space i'm talking about the same space that quantum mechanics and quantum physics is talking
about well there's this interesting like reproduction of uh of the paradox of space that i even see like in
contemporary like quantum physics work so for example um you know about spin networks i'll explain briefly
like my understanding of spin networks you may have to explain for briefly yeah spin networks uh it's
basically the simple idea and uh you know slaughter me in the comments if i'm wrong about this
i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure the basic idea is that you sorry people are people are very brutal when it
comes to quantum mechanics and ai good good we need to be we need to be severe in this world when it
comes to you know intellectual things but um so the basic idea right is that we can actually i can
actually tell you what space is right that it's actually um a series like a network series of different
spins different nodes and i can draw sort of lines between these nodes and i can tell you that's the
materiality of space that is space itself right there that i've just drawn for you so again different
nodes that are connected by like lines between them the interesting thing to me in this demonstration
right if i were to buy into it and say like okay wow you've you've demonstrated that like there is this
materiality to space i'd have to ask again like what's the stuff in between right like what's the emptiness
in between these nodes so i see that problem being recreated but i think just like take a step back
and see like why even quantum physics right i think my incursion into quantum physics is really basic and
i think the basic thing that i find revolutionary about quantum physics that most i think most people
would agree with me on again slaughter me in the comments if you don't i'd love to see it um is simply that
quantum physics takes the observer into account and this is this is radical right that for classical
physics there was a tendency to say the observer is divorced from the experiment that i'm trying to
eliminate any kind of observation any kind of observational bias as much as i can and i can really
know reality if i can simply perfect my measuring tool if i can get a really good measuring stick i can
really know things as they appear their structure their you know the elements behind them their
particles behind them whereas what quantum physics says is well the observer is actually entangled in
the experiment and that this changes things that when we observe things that there is an ontological
again entanglement between the observer and the observed and this i find very interesting right this is
just a very simple shift that says that the way we determine the world has an actual ontological
implication on the world itself so this i see and this is i'm taking a page from karen brard's book
meeting the universe halfway which i think savoy takes a very big page from as well um
um this is not an epistemic shift right this is an ontological shift and i'm not throwing that word
around right like i mean this in a very serious way right it's not that oh the electron has a position
in the cloud we just don't know where it is right but it has some sort of position that's not what
quantum physics says it says in a much stronger sense the electron is ontologically indeterminate in
its position until we determine it right this is like the principle behind schortinger's cat it's
both dead and alive right the electron is in multiple places at once or it's in no place
right this is a fun little kind of game to play and so this i think is is huge right and i don't need
to like be in the lab to like i think comment on this right and i do think just really simply right
like as philosophers if we're told that we like can't talk about science this is like a sad you know
dead end to thought right and that if we're going to talk about time and space and you know i i talk
a little bit about time in my work but like my focus is on space i need to be able to ask what does it
mean for place to be totally upended by modern quantum physics to say that particles natural entities
can be completely without place and they still exist right it's they still exist that electrons still
exist doesn't disappear into the ether but it's become ontologically indeterminate and so very
broadly i think that um there's an ontological dignity given to indeterminacy by quantum physics
and this is i think so important and it completely is the way i read with space right is that space is
this indeterminacy that still exists and has a huge and important ontological function
just like the electrons indeterminacy it still exists there's a lot there to unpack and this is
what i think is really interesting about modern quantum physics without you know getting too far
ahead of myself but that's my basic incursion i completely agree i mean in fact i was just having
this conversation uh day before yesterday with another philosopher of science who's working more on the
sociology of science and uh it's interesting uh i mentioned even in that conversation uh stephen
hawkins in his famous book he says uh uh philosophy is dead we don't need philosophy anymore now it's
physics will give us all the answers and then of course it's kind of like nietzsche saying god is dead
uh you know he declares some some some some big other is dead and then now i think philosophy is coming
back to the vengeance in some sense because you i mean you can't help but not philosophize on these
questions uh in fact as you mentioned the in an electron cloud you can't ask an electron okay if
it's pure potential potentiality what does that mean like how do you can't just you can't just think
of it purely in the language of mathematics because we have to derive some meaning out of it um yeah and
uh i would say oh on spin networks i just remembered i watched this fantastic talk by uh color valley so
for the listeners i'll i'll find it i'll leave a link down below just on spin networks just independent
to its its mathematical beauty and physical beauty there's something very interesting in just
how it can imbue a lot of these conversations uh so following on from this katherine um i really like
this point that todd mcgovern made uh uh regarding hegel and kant this kind of distinction distinction
and i think i'm quoting him verbatim here in fact he says that kant was the philosopher of newtonian
mechanics or classical physics um and he says that hegel in our time is now the philosopher of quantum
mechanics and the reason he says that is because again as you mentioned it's all these paradoxes
contradictions and i probably should also mention um it's interesting that in the 20th century what
took place in in kind of thought or in the world of in intellectual world it's not just the paradoxes
from quantum mechanics but even in logic with uh goodles and incompleteness theorems russell's paradoxes
and there's even uh i would even argue probably even with uh evolution there are some things that are
rather paradoxical in how evolution works uh so i'm curious just to comment on that why in particular
as a hegelian philosopher do you think hegel hegel's concepts has has something interesting to say
about the contemporary uh contemporary scene in physics or the contemporary theories in physics
yeah it's a great question because i think it would be a mistake to say that you know hegel
presaged you know contemporary no no no he's not he's not for sure no i definitely not but that
would be like the that would be like the wrong way to read it right is to be like oh like hegel
predicted all of this right the the question is more like how yeah that would be that that was
sorry to interrupt but that would be the way jordan peterson reads nietzsche or whoever yeah exactly
exactly right and that's uh that's not what todd's saying and um definitely not what savoy's saying
either um the i think what you know all of us are saying is simply that uh you know hegel's logic
really holds up with like today's problems right like in a really simple way but to dig into it you
know hegel again like if we talk about space right like hegel's writing um very much in the wake of like
the newton leibnitz debate right and kant can totally agree with todd right kant very much takes up like the
newtonian position of like an absolute space and he in many of his writings he'll say that there's a
that space is absolute there's an absolute center that completely contrary to what i said at the start
of this conversation that this space here is different from this space here they there is some
absolute matrix that distinguishes space as such now kant's logical space i think is more interesting
and more hegelian because there's this text by kant um what does it mean to orient oneself in thinking
and this this i think is more interesting because he will say at the end that we have to have some
sort of active faith to orient us in our thought but then we like rationally build the the ground out
from underneath our feet and we can really like build out with reason so that maybe is like you know
this also sounds a bit like bad doozy and right we affirm an event that it may be as contingent
but we build the truth from that event nonetheless or that truth is implicit we build it out to
through faith um and so for hegel um in the nature he does talk about leibnitz and he says that
you know space is relational is of a higher order than an absolute space however he makes this really
great caveat um he says that space is in its very self-externality it is self-externality and so i
think this really interesting like absolute that hegel introduces that's contrary to leibnitz instead of
saying simply space is just relational period space is just relational for sure for hegel but it's also
it is externality as long as there is something external this is just space this is spatial right
and so i think this anchors nature and it anchors space in this in this very particular way that
allows us to escape some sort of just like regressive relativists like where does any
of this stuff come from right like it is externality as such um and so yeah in terms of hegel sorry being
the thinker of hegel being the thinker of quantum physics um i think another interesting thing that quantum
physics teaches us is that like what appears like that's what is like that's what's there right
there's not some like secret essence to this electron that it really has like a particular
place we just don't know it again like this is the very content reading right that like we're
barred in our knowledge and understanding where that electron is yeah and so i think that um like
zionist shine right being his shine for hegel right being his essence being his appearance
that what's what presents itself that is being there's not some secret backdrop that we can't
access right and i think quantum physics takes this to heart as well um and like i mentioned like
this is i mean it's a really particular way to read hegel you know not everyone reads hegel like this
as well but in my own work i became just very interested in the concept of like place in hegel
in hegel and the fact that at the very beginning of the logic we're confronted with this paradox of
being and nothing having no place no determinacy about them so just for some context right like
the way that uh the logic starts out we have a very infamous opening hegel asked us to think about
being pure being without further determination and nothing the pure nothing likewise without further
determination and he famously concludes that if we think about being without any further determination
then it might as well just be nothing it's just this blank emptiness he calls it he calls it void
the very start and then with nothing he says likewise if we just think about nothing without further
determination it's also a being right it's also empty he says it's led so what i've been interested in
with hegel is thinking about this paradox this presuppositionless place he takes us to
is really a place without place it's a starting point that isn't even in the ground we're truly just
floating in the void we are talking about the void we're talking about being in nothing without any
determination and so likewise this is just void this is emptiness so badu for example says in theory the
subject his critique of hegel here is that this is just a weak difference between the two this is
this being and nothing this is just a weak difference of positionality they're just marking the void they're
just two identical marks and i don't think badu is wrong i think that just like to turn the screw once
more with badu it's not simply that we're marking the void there's this in and out of marking the void and
marking a place but also of having absolutely no place and being completely void so this is what i think
quantifices this helps us think about is that there can be a lack of place that we can think
and that's really crazy that's really radical to me and that there is a again like an ontological
standing to not being logically placed and like this is nature writ large and this is i really think
the way like we like this is the way i think we should be thinking about nature is that it is just in
different stuff out there it's just a bunch of stuff without i mean it has differences in it it
doesn't know it and once we start differentiating nature we start placing nature that's when we start
determining nature but before that it's just indeterminate ontologically indeterminate so again
i think you know back to space it's not i think it would be a mistake to say that
nature space is infinite i think this the better way to put this is that they're just indeterminate
and indifferent they go on as long as we keep differentiating the big lit on the macro layer on
the micro layer there's always more stuff there's always more space but this doesn't make it necessarily
infinite it's not that it is ongoing right now as we speak but that as i determine there's always going
to be more to determine this is why nature is full of wonder for hegel wow look there's so much more
yeah and there's a great optimism to that reading of hegel because i mean i wouldn't even say i'm not
even an optimist i'm i would say a pessimist probably but yeah yeah in the in when you start your thesis
you say you you talk about vertigo but then you see this there's an optimism to this openness and
and here's what i think it's quite interesting because i've i've been doing a lot of reading of
character guard two in the past few years and like he always touches on the infinite in that sense for
him the infinite is like a substantial infinite in in some sense gold and so he does still think that
there's a in a fascinating way his infinity is a is a spurious infinity or it's a it's a close it's not
truly an infinity in the like that openness um and i find that quite interesting um a few things i want
to say here is all right so externality let's probably touch on that a little bit because i
think so i haven't read the science of logic in any way as carefully as you have the text i work with
most is the phenomenology um and one thing i like that uh steven who'll get uh see when he'll get
yeah so he'll get says about um the kind of hegel's work presuppositionalist metaphysics is that
it's an imminent critique right so he what's beautiful about phenomenology is that he kind of
works through modes of consciousness or structures of consciousness you know it starts with uh sense
certainty and so on and so and i guess how can i ask this question uh catherine i'm trying to see
through through more through like the phenomenology because i find the phenomenology as
as funny as it sounds it's a it's less abstract than the logic yeah i i totally agree totally you can
walk through the text as you go so i'm trying to see if if you could kind of help us help help when
i mean us really me kind of conceptualize or kind of illustrate what this externality would look like
from the pers from the perspective of like a phenomenal subject or you know phenomenologically
speaking i guess in some sense i'm saying if you start with the eye how does how does one experience
just leaving aside more of the quantum mechanics or whatever the other concepts uh yeah i don't
know that's an unfair question but i'm just trying to see if it's cool um yeah i think so
externalities is is what nature is for hegel it's the external right and at the end of the science of
logic the idea externalizes itself and time and space are created and it's a wild ending that's been
commented on so much and um i really just focused on what does this externality aspect mean in the
phenomenology i think this is a really classic move that hegel makes right is that his many modes of
logic and many steps that he's making in the phenomenology are constantly externalizing
themselves and there's this constant alienation that's happening right even uh but it's really an
alienation i think what was that you said i used to you used to call it failure but i think a better
term yeah like every structure of consciousness fails and you move on the next stages yeah yeah
fails or alienates and stuff i think they both yeah capture capture the spirit of spirit in this way
um i mean even starting with the the many here's right with like sense certainty that
well i know this table is a table because it's right here and i'm pointing to it right well we
have to like externalize or alienate the here's right and say well there's actually many here's and
you know one here is going to be different than another here and so that's right so that's a way
that i think externality plays a role in in hegel's logic in general like we've talked about there's
this constant alienation in this bare minimum of space that's not necessary and the master slave
dialectic like i brought up before that's i think one of the clearest examples right of consciousness
stepping outside of itself even in the smaller uh philosophy of spirit in the encyclopedia
right there's these like even smaller steps that are made where um consciousness says i'm not the soul
right and the soul also misrecognizes itself even before that as the body he says oh that's me i'm the
body there's these like you know mistakes these failures these alienations um before then consciousness
says oh i'm also conscious i'm also have this but i'm not consciousness right that's self-consciousness
now talking right these like continuous steps of alienation that are like progressive and and build
in hegel's logic yeah perfect perfect i i think i think that makes sense i mean i i would say in
fact i would say the best way to you don't even have to read all of terminology i found as you point
out you because sense certainty probably is the easiest section to read in the phenomenologies
because it's very like he talks about a tree i think and a house or something and it's like it's
very yeah and then of course the master slave dialectic uh and the other good thing is there's a lot
of texts there's a lot of work done on the master step dialectic so you could just use that text
itself to understand what he means by kind of consciousness going out of itself uh to find
itself in sometimes even though that never really really happens um all right the next next part i want
to get to so i guess we're talking about subjectivity here and this this kind of makes me want to talk
about a bit more invoke topics uh however i also want to talk about the gap which really uh caught my eye
when i was reading your work would you do you think it's better if you now move on to a bit more
towards ai and have that discussion or do you think yeah whatever you like good yeah cool i think we'll
discuss ai and get to the gap towards the end because that's a bit more like in the speculative realm
um so great great article you wrote uh catherine um for the philosophical salon uh dust shag gpt and joy
this is your working off uh george's work uh where he says you know chagip is unconscious um
so first of all yeah i'll just say this i mean people in the kind of the hegelian lacanian kind
of theory scene uh the other person i've seen who's really serious theorized on ai is isabel miller
uh i just started on a book i'm still getting through it well look the the question with ai it kind
of now i feel it's becoming like an ex the topic has exhausted itself because people keep talking
about it all the time uh it and some of it can tend to get a bit boring but i still think it's a
necessary topic only because at some level it does speak to this question of yeah to put it in a very
very humanistic way what does it mean to be human what is subjectivity what is our conscious experience
and so kind of like kind of like quantum mechanics or physics as such you can't help but philosophize
on something like ai um but i'm curious uh from your kind of galleon lens not not none of these
questions about you know is ai going to be conscious i don't care about any of that uh but i'd rather
ask this question what do you think the ongoing dialogue about ai tells us about our subjectivity
um as in yeah could you please like talk talk on that and then maybe we'll kind of slightly touch on
your article does judge pd enjoy yeah i mean i think you you put it really well that with the advent of ai
and it passing the turing test right made us ask ourselves well like what distinguishes us as humans
from the ai and i think last year this was a really big question we've now come to understand more and
more how we are different in very particular ways but it's it's still really astounding that like we
can be fooled by a picture or by a text thinking a human wrote this or a human drew this and i think we
all want to think we're so much smarter than that but some pictures really do trick you into thinking
like that's a real photo right that's a real video and not until like the flaws are pointed out or you
look at it for a very long time do you start to to see the funkiness going on in these things so
i think there's a an inclination that we don't want to be duped you know we don't want to be fooled
um there's the age-old question like how do i know you feel the things i feel um implicit here as
well but then i think with the ai i mean i wrote this article because i thought the simplest way to
you know to explain the difference is that the machine can't enjoy and this is obviously a very
lacanian reading right to say that what makes us human what makes us different from animals is that
we have really weird enjoyment right like we don't just have sex to procreate right like we enjoy in
very bizarre ways not just sexually right like we enjoy our failures right like we you know smoke
cigarettes we drink alcohol right like we we enjoy hurting ourselves in different ways and there's of
course you know wonderful psychoanalytic theory to back this up but then to think about ai i mean like
if we were to take it back to space there isn't open space for ai it's completely closed space right it's
a completely closed algorithmic space and there is no space for freedom and there is no space for
transgression and humans what makes us free is we transgress the limits so that's also how we enjoy
we love to we love to push a boundary right that's again very wrapped up with with libidinal enjoyment
and with suffering too right as we maybe fail to reach a certain limit or we turn we push too far beyond
a limit and we hurt ourselves this way i drink too much alcohol at night right and then the next day
oh this horrible hang it hangover i feel guilty why did i drink more than two drinks i said i was
only going to have two right that's oh but i enjoyed it the whole time right like this is like part of our
libidinal economy um but if i tell a robot you can't have more than two drinks you know my you know blade
runner robot i'm going out with it's not going to have more than two drinks and right the there's an
impossibility of programming a program to defy the program right like this and if that can happen you
know i'll eat my hat right like that would be really i mean really astounding to see if
that could be accomplished right but as it stands this is what fundamentally distinguishes us from
the machine right is that we do step outside of our limits so when we're thinking about you know how
to make a machine more intelligent or does its intelligence mimic the humans um there's this great
book by hofstadter that i reference in the article uh go to lesher bach have you you have it on
yourself of course yeah yeah it's such a great such a good tome um it's it's so good it's yeah what a
beautiful text um i mean he makes a lot of arguments in that book but one one one argument that really
stuck with me was if you give a human an impossible task let's say hey here's a math problem that is
absolutely impossible to solve at a certain point you're gonna walk away you're gonna put your pencil
down and be like i can't do that but a machine can't walk away from an impossible task right it
will do it at infinitum until the until it gets too hot you know and dies right um and so i mean this is
again like you know this is what makes us human is that we it makes us intelligent is that we can step
outside of a certain boundary we can we literally we step outside of ourselves that is what we are
that is like definitionally we are the thing that is self-conscious that can look back and say i am
me in this like weird redoubled way and there's still a debate if like animals can do that and like
sometimes they show us they can and that's wild you know like that's that's absolutely wild but some
animals definitely show us that they might not be able to do that right i'm not an animal expert
here but i think that that grayness that comes with the animal just sort of underlines more in
a more firm sense that this is what the human is it can step outside of itself and so that's i think
the the really basic difference between you know us and ai and yeah i think that is the puzzle today for
if you are trying to yeah make ai more sentient right would be how do i break how does it learn how to
break its own rules but just you know terrifying proposition and there's other terrifying propositions
that come with ai in the world we're living in right now but yeah just on this basic sentience
level that's uh i think what hegel can teach us and what the con can teach us about ai yeah pretty
much i think the big thing is enjoyment but also like in in hofzada's book uh the big thing the point
he makes is you know with girls theorems is that uh theorem can't prove its own consistency any any uh
sufficiently powerful and the fact that in some sense in in it's a problem of self-reference right
we humans can self-reference kind of like subconsciousness we can step outside of ourselves
and in fact you know i i even argue you have to step outside of yourself to really be self-conscious if
not you really can't you get stuck in this this like infinite abyssal self-related negativity if not
um precisely i think the enjoyment question is quite interesting too because i think
uh cadel and i had this conversation a while back i think fundamentally here's what what i've been
thinking about so i mean my my background's in computer science so a big part of computer science is
systems theory uh you know we we study a variety of systems and there's something very interesting
about systems theory uh they're all closed systems so that that's the that's the big thing in systems
theory of course there's a whole branch especially in biology where they study open systems um but the
the thing is even in a closed system uh there aren't there aren't subjects like the the problem always is
that the subject never fits into the order of things and and for me what i find interesting about this
conversation pertaining to ai the philosophical question is well yeah at what point does does a
subject come into this because come into being from of some kind of system because i mean i'm a pure
materialist i do believe subjects emerge from objects uh and so i think enjoyment is one it's it's
one indicator i mean enjoyment once you start seeing how you know we we enjoy our failures we in fact want
to fail and then that's where there's like this loop um i think love again i go back to love because i
think love is the perfect example here this uh idea that you know when uh when an animal pursues a mate if
if they don't get the mate they either go and they find some other mate or they uh i don't know
unfortunately rape the animal i guess but uh in the case of humans we we we keep pursuing the the
main in fact we want to not we really enjoy the rejection and sometimes once you get it it it's it's
done you know you don't care i can't yeah then you're like okay no more um and that's where i find like
like especially locating psychoanalysis quite pertinent to this conversation around ai
and yeah the question shouldn't be uh can can a can a ai reason or can it's can they yeah and then
yeah that's fascinating excellent yeah i think the point yeah i completely agree and i'm trying to
think this more thoroughly through in terms of like the space of ai and also also like digital space in
general right like and again right if for humans there's a certain openness in our space in nature
in logic even in spirits like generation of itself that it can keep generating itself and like it is
self-generating um the closed space of ai seems to completely like cut any of that out of the question
um yeah that's uh and you know in the systems theory thing as well it's it's an interesting question
because um this just i want to just like tell the classic joke when it comes to like counting
right like so funny like you know the how ai has some problems with math right like it has some
problems problems yes some problems counting and you know multiplying and there's some wires getting
crossed in in this way but it's just not set up but in such a way for it to like be a calculator
right like it's it's predictive right um but there's the great joke from look on you know i have three
brothers ernesto paul and myself this is precisely what ai can't do right it can't count itself as one
in the sense that right i can't like redouble this and this is like again a great looking and piece of
like the subject right it's like i count myself twice in this way right i kept myself once when i should
just be a zero right i mean this is what zero is as well but this is i think also what ai can't do
right it can't it can't even count to you know it can like can it count at all can it count to four
in a lacanian sense can it count to three i think it simply can't count at all because it has this
this precise trouble in uh in identifying i think like you put like there's no subject in yeah yeah in
the equation right like who's counting the equation it's it's sort of precisely like can ai fall in
love of course not because you have to fall in love you need to have an eye a subject that falls
right yeah yeah and you know that's the other thing where i find this divide between you know
the ostensible divide between analytic philosophy and mcconnell philosophy because analytic philosophy in
some sense never truly accounts for the subject a lot of a lot of the conversations around it it tends
to be a bit more yeah like they'll speak of like andy clark wrote this great book called the extended
mind excellent book in cognitive science but still lacks that so here's the simple notion the notions
that our cognition it's it's distributed uh that we like we think through other people which is
certainly i mean at a colloquial level you say that right i mean language for instance but it still
doesn't really capture this notion of like what is a subject and how the subject kind of goes the
externality of the subject and what allows for the subject to be in this being um so yeah there's a
lot of the unconscious can be missing sometimes right from the equation i think that's what so many
like lecanian theorists today point out is like where's the unconscious like i watched ghost in the
shell recently what a great film so fun to watch but i was thinking like where's ghost in the shell i
i haven't watched it yeah oh you know it's like classic enemy film um where the robot gains
consciousness right but i in the the people can like download their brains onto the cloud right which
is of course you know sci-fi conversation made very relevant today but the question is like how do you
yeah you know i have my memories but they're structured in such a way for my unconscious right and
so how does one transcribe the unconscious you know that which can't be written as such this is like
the i think an outstanding question for i mean it's a big question for even what makes us human like
how do we talk about the unconscious but likewise with the ai i think it's a big question too and with
neural link great this is that boy's point that neural link totally elides the the question of the
unconscious yeah yeah and in fact uh another thing adds i i just add on to this is uh peter roland has
this beautiful analogy where again he says that something that like there's there's something and
nothing and he says you know for the kind of people in the anglo-american you know bertrand russell all
all of these this way of thinking nothing is just nothing whereas for uh more of the again so-called
coinal philosophers coming from heidegger hegel and so on nothing is something nothing is a
substantial nothingness and and that's for me that's the unconscious like that not the negativity
itself is a it's an ontologically true substantial negativity and there's how can we do that because
there's there's no way informal logic or in uh in and kind of models that we train to capture that but
again as an engineer i always find this like a fascinating question because even when i'm building
software um like i'm we we're we're told to always think about the kind of the end user and kind of
try to see what how the user would interact with the system and sometimes i get carried away when i
start thinking about like the unconscious and how can i you know how do you how do you unconscious
interact with the software we build anyway i'm getting a bit that's a great yeah but uh okay
but you bring up a great point as well i don't want to like uh derail us for anything but um
the question of naming nothingness actually does take us back really nicely to like a lot of the
the work that we've been discussing um you know this debate that goes back to the ancient greeks
right you know parmenides says the you know that you know the nothing is not we can't say it is um
and then you know lucretius says you know it's it's definitely something the void is something it has
a weight to it even is one of his arguments um but this is i think a really big piece of
continental thinking right is that there is this like agreement that like nothingness has a certain
ontological standing and that when we name nothingness this is foundational for for language
for math right i mean for badu we have to count the void as one right we have to name the void count
it as an empty set count it as a singleton in this way and then we can derive the cardinal numbers
and so for right the basis of math we need to count space right count nothingness as something
and so that you know takes me back to like why i've been so interested in space is precisely it's
straddling both the fact that it doesn't exist it's it is nothingness but then as soon as i name it i bring
it into existence so it's i think like the the critical example of making something out of nothing right of
uh and not to be like you know uh you know ex nihilo like too much but it it is the example of this
right that that demonstrates that when we name things uh we are you know disentangling an entangled
world and in that disentanglement we're likewise like weaving the void we're putting nothingness
into that something we're weaving being a non-being together in a hegelian sense i hope that helps us like
bridge in some way that's that's a good segue because the next part i want to get to is this
idea of the gap um like what is the gap so all right i'm going to do this more for the listener
because i think it's it's important to give this context but i'm going to read a few quotes here uh
catherine uh one quote from uh adrian johnston's book a new german idealism man i've read this quote so
many times uh i'm like it's ad nauseum i love this quote so much because for me it captures a lot of
kind of kind of what we're discussing and the other is uh sort of what you theorize on pertaining
to the gap and i'm just going to try and see if you could flesh out perhaps the differences or even
similarities so firstly um since we're talking about subjectivity uh adrian johnson states in the new
german idealism uh the the subject is the immense absolute power of negativity the power of
introducing a gap or cut into the given immediate substantial unity the power of differentiating of
abstracting of tearing apart and treating as self-standing what in reality is part of an organic
unity uh of course organic unity part we can discuss if that's really the case but see that that notion
for me really captures what you just described that we you know we've even completely out by labeling
things nothing whatever the case may be so that's that's that's adrian johnston uh and then you say here
in your thesis uh regarding the role of the gap you say uh in fact sorry give me a second i'll find the
full quote because i think this is a bit out of context just bear with me for a second okay so this
is a bit a bit of a mouthful here but here's what you say beautifully put so it is spirited beings who
uniquely traverse both the externality of nature and their own internality shaping both spaces through
reason and through reason successes for sure these are the three hegelian registers and here's what i really
like here so logic nature and spirit each has a unique space and a unique structure in which empty space
is sublated by differentiation between these three registers certain gaps persist logic weaves itself into
nature spirit shapes nature and likewise separates itself from nature and spirits and spirit is itself a
redoubling of the logical idea that has returned into itself and this is very important there is an
ontological irreducibility to these gaps as such but far from being a pessimistic conclusion it is space
as well as avoid the gap and lack that keep the world open without space all would be at one point
collapsed self-same and dimensionless with space ontological horizons remain open there's always
more space to determine to think freely to explore so i think the latter part we already touched on but
what i want to try and understand is yeah what's the gap you speak of because maybe i've just understood
this but for me i in many ways thought of the subject as being this gap more more along adrian johnson's
notion but it could be like that was a lot there i know but i think it's important to build it up for
the more for the listeners but could you talk about the gap catherine like what what is that i'd love to
i'd love to not just a clothing store um the gap but you know it's deployed in so many ways right as like a
constitutive of the subject that we're structured around a gap right that we're split around some
sort of void and so in my work i really wanted to try and be rigorous with the some definitions and
say like you know really like what is the void and you know like for example like with aristotle when
he talks about the void it's a very naturalistic question for him right as like the void as um
the ground of motion but the way that hegel really talks about the void is in the logic so i just
sort of like say the void is a logical construction and that's a really important one that i'll touch
upon in in this question here um these gaps in this particular context this sort of gap that i'm
talking about we could definitely call it like a gap of subjectivity we can call it gaps in logic
the specific quote that you referenced i'm really thinking about the gaps between the three hegelian
registers so just for context um right the encyclopedia has three different volumes of um the
logic nature and spirit and so maybe some of you know the listeners would be familiar with the three
lacanian registers this is often how we talk about you know lacan is that there's the imaginary the
symbolic and the real i think for hegel we can really ontologically distinguish these registers of
logic nature and spirit and that they're completely distinct yet they do overlap they do weave together
but they can't be reduced to each other right we can't just say nature is logic even though we find
logic in nature all the time right but nature always exceeds logic like that is what nature is it's
also externality so we can't reduce the two together likewise spirit spirit can reason spirit can employ
logic but it'd be a mistake to say that spirit is logic likewise even though spirit comes from nature
it would be a mistake to say that spirit is nature so the point is that there's this this irreducibility
between the three different registers and one has to ask what is that irreducibility right what is that
space between these three registers and why are there gaps well if they all just like linked together
perfectly or they all could collapse together we wouldn't even have like a system at all right it
would all just be again everything would collapse at one point right like we need to have some sort
of like distinction between these three and so um the one of the sentences that you quoted from my text
uh i think is a nice way to kind of simplify some of this and there's there's a lot to it right um
but simply that spirit traverses nature and weaves logic into nature this is one way to see how the
three registers operate that you know i name the things around myself like per adrian right like i'm
disentangling an entangled world right um how did he put it right you know we're differentiating and
we're abstracting um things that are tearing apart we're tearing the world apart right i'm looking at
the grass in the field i'm saying like that's one blade that's another blade i'm distinguishing the
grass from the shrubbery right well these are two different things and in that shrub i'm like here's a
leaf here's a root and as we know with nature like you know our inclination as humans to like categorize
nature to um create certain like boxes for nature to fit into what we know from our experience doing
this and hegel tells us this as well is that nature will always exceed any kind of categorization it's
always going to break the rules right there's always going to be an exception um and so you
know that's that's interesting right but nonetheless back to this gap i think adrian puts this like really
really really well that the power of the subject that's how i put it right the power is to is to
break things apart to introduce a cut so let's really kind of break that down a bit right to
introduce the gap let's let's break that down because it's not simply that in identifying one
blade of grass sorry one sec excuse me it's not simply in identifying one blade of grass that i can say
oh here's a being and everything around it is its non-being right this this is partly what
he's saying right and this is a spatial way to understand it right there's the thing and there's
everything outside of it that's not the thing but what he's also saying and i think what todd and
savoy and myself are all saying is that when we name that blade i mean i'll quote milan and delar here
the name names the unnameable there's something that exceeds the name as such something more to that
blade of grass than is that blade of grass or something that fails even in that in that reckoning
and so the way i conceive of this is that there's a couple steps here at all i'll i do want to
summarize i think it is an as it is an important point is that when we we start off with the hegel's
nature we move from space from just the indifference of nature not to time but to the point time comes
after we get to the point after we talk about space and the point is just this this difference right this
infinitesimal difference that's inserted into the indifference of space the fascinating one sec sorry
the fascinating dramatic pause thing about the insertion of the point is that the point isn't
natural the point is logical right like it doesn't you know we all can agree on this the point nowhere
occurs in nature the point is a logical construction and hegel discusses the point in the nature as a
logical construction as um he calls it an abstract limit which is really interesting right because
abstract for hegel means that it's in isolation so if we were to think of a limit in isolation without
it delimiting anything we just have like just this cut of difference right and in this way when we're
pointing out things in nature because i mean one of the i think of that is you know avery johnson calls
like weak weak nature as in nature is just it's stupid it's just there it's dumb it it doesn't have
these yeah in itself yeah and so what we do when we disentangle nature it's not simply that we're
demonstrating the non-being outside of the thing but we're actually weaving a gap into that thing itself
and this really comes from weaving the point into nature because the point is really just
this gap right this it's really a negativity that we're weaving into negativity right this is negation
of negation right that we take the indifferent blankness of space which is itself a type of
negativity it has a negativity implicit within it it's just indifferent and we weave this negativity of
the point then we make something i i really think this is this is the way to read it personally
um moreover what we learn when we read the logic is that when we determine in being we produce two
paradoxes just the very get-go there's many paradoxes but two that we can focus on we produce the paradox
of the one and the void right when i name a certain object i'm calling it a one and i'm also indicating
the indeterminacy around the void and likewise within it as well and so the reason i'm making
this argument is that the way hegel defines determinant being in the logic he says it's the unity of being
and non-being or being in a certain place so that place would be like the non-being right so if we think
about being in a certain place and this is why place is so interesting right we think of being in a certain
place as that's how we determine being a logical place right not a not a natural place right a
logical place the cup is different than the table is different than the bowl i have a sort of logical
mapping we produce the paradox of being without a place and nothing in a place so the one and the
void the one is a being without place it just has its own self-reference it doesn't reference anything
else i'm just one i need no other reference and the void sorry i'm gonna live today yeah if you want
to break we can by the way i feel bad now no no i'm i know it's like i'm having a bit of a cough but
it's okay we're gonna we're gonna survive um yeah thanks guys at least for this conversation but uh the
void for a bit longer maybe tomorrow as well let's see how it goes but you gotta write your book so after
you write your book uh then then i can leave bury me with it that's all i ask just bury me with it
so we get these two paradoxes straight we get the one as being without a place and the void as nothing
in its place and anytime we determine being these these two paradoxes are present right we can't get
rid of them and so likewise when we disentangle nature right when we say this is one blade of grass
i'm naming it as such we weave in this excess this void into that blade of grass as well right so
this i think is really critical when it comes to precisely what adrian said right it's not just that
we're cutting things up into pieces but that that piece itself can maintains a gap within it because
we've named it because we've distinguished it because we've logically determined it and this is
this is what is in contrast with nature right for both bad doing for hegel nature is just smooth
continuity right there's bad do i think puts it really well he says that there's no gaps in nature
it's just smooth stability whereas for bad do like history needs to have like instability implicit in it we
need to have the potential for there to be ruptures and crises um but nature doesn't have that it's just
you know chronos it's just this continuity of destruction and death and indifference and keeps
going on doesn't matter um so this is i think the really beautiful way to think about this gap right or
this cut this negativity this void a lot of different ways to call it but i do think the spatial element is
really critical to why we describe these like contradictions and these incompletions as as
spatial as gaps for every reason i've just said does that make sense i think i'm getting it i'm getting
them getting into your kind of thinking but i think i'm still kind of struggling with how you said that
you know there's the void and the one and then there's space so when you play that of course we're
talking about logical space here right and when we say something is in a logical space you're saying we
create both the the the one and the void so the one would be the self-referential like it's just me
in myself and then the void is everything else is that the kind of the i don't know if it's like a
dualism but is that the the the two that we posit haha yeah that's a bit i'm still a bit confused on
yeah yeah i'll break down um so there's like two steps to the argument right there's the idea of
like a logical spatiality and then how that logic weaves into nature right which is a different type
of spatiality so for the logic right we start the logic off in hegel with just the indeterminate void
right and then once we actually name these things right we name being a nothing then we actually
have this paradox that unravels between naming everything as one which is you know all the void
is one in which the void reappears this is really like where motion comes in where movement comes in
so i mean i think in a very simple way whenever we make a logical determination we're making it
against the background of indeterminacy right against the void we're making different logical
connections different relations that's offset by that which is indeterminate right the the piece
i wanted to argue here is that when we when we actually determine things and we say that here's a
being in a particular place in a logical place that if this is how we determine things if there's this
unity between being and place then there must be these two like distributive sort of like in a
mathematical sense like this distributive paradox of being without place and nothing with place
which is the one in the void that are produced when we start to name things and so any naming of
anything any determination of being we start to count things as ones right but they're not really
unified right this is an arbitrary cut that maintains a gap within the thing itself nonetheless right the
one is void for hegel as well and so this is you know this contradiction implicit in indeterminate
beam but nonetheless you know we can determine as such yes yes when we think about like natural space i
think the really interesting piece is that when we point out things in nature we inscribe this pointalistic
one this empty one this like this point that is void as well we inscribe this void this little point
and emptiness it's just it's just negativity it's just this empty thing we inscribe it into the
emptiness of nature there's this double this redoubling of negativity but on exactly a negation
negation but within two different registers and that's how like we get things yeah who's doing this
spirited being is doing this like this is the way i think we can think about the three different
registers right is spirited being we use logic into nature through this negation of negation that produces
something yes and and and in this when the spirited being does this this is also the act of freedom
right i mean that's in some sense that's one way to look at it yeah completely i think that's a great
way to look at it actually i mean because depends on what we mean by freedom right like if i just uh
am calling the cup a cup because everyone else calls it a cup um that's not necessarily free right
but when i name something new right in a badusian sense right would i name a new event right when we
storm like you know when it's 1871 and we've taken over my mat but you know in paris that way of is
much better sorry i interrupted you keep going katherine no no it's okay when we call that the
paris commune right right that's a thing and i've given it a new name that uh that creation of a new
name i have just woven right points into the the site right this is why we need a site for bad do we
need an actual place to call it to like for the event to take place um we're creating something out
of nothing and we're creating a whole new world for bad do right a whole new logical orientation
and that is an act of freedom and i and that is a that is i think uh one way we can read this as well
yeah i mean look i in no way have read baju as much as you have i mean i'm just honestly haven't
read baju at all really a few of his books uh but i always think but when i think baju especially
from his uh introduction to being an event i think disjuncture and that disjuncture always for me has
like freedom to it because it's this symbolic order that wasn't a part of the previous it's
something totally new something totally novel it doesn't come on from the the old symbolic order
of so to speak and you have to affirm it which is what i love it one of my favorite aspects of
bad do is that you have to say yes to the event i love this yeah totally i mean i find it so
interesting that all of these thinkers uh more than budget i think even hegel
that kind of caricature is they're like these totalizing thinkers you're building these huge
systems but but they're ultimately thinkers of freedom and also they're deeply you could even call
them like even like existentialist in satrian sense that they they deeply have allowed the subject to
be free at freedom it's uh as frederick biser said in his book on uh general idealism it's it's like this
struggle with subjectivity and and and how can we be yeah so um i completely agree i mean i think that
this is hegel's project right is that a spirit ultimately realizes that it makes its own world
older right and that it can reorient itself in its world it can choose that new point of orientation
to ground being a nothing at the start of the logic right it can choose a new point of measurement
to unfold a whole new world right and this is also i think how bad do things as well right is that we
have the ability to to reorient in order to reorient that we have to disorient right we have to like
look the void in the face right we have to like grapple with that anxiety with that vertigo
let it go in order i was going to say religion is yeah yeah yeah right in order to then say okay i'm
going to pull myself back and i'm going to ground myself here right and not just in the old way but
in a new in a new way yeah no i think now it's all in my head yeah especially your kind of ontologies
it's coming together in my head yeah this is where i think it's really important it's interesting
catherine every johnson when i spoke to him he said something which kind of spoke to me quite deeply he
said that we think that philosophy that there are two kinds of uh intellectuals or philosophers or
thinkers like there are who you'd call historians of philosophy so you could you could call someone
like frederick beyser a historian of philosophy where they they take they they document and they
speak about all the different thinkers their ideas and then he says then some people think that there
are philosophers as such who kind of come up with new theories so jack is probably in our times the
one name we all can think of however he says that that delineation it's a mistake because they both are
doing philosophy as in as an accounting and kind of re-articulating what uh historical historically
philosophers wrote about theorized on and putting it into our own language itself as philosophy and
that's what i find really interesting not just this simple short conversation we had but like
reading your work because in many ways you're re-articulating a lot of the work through these
thinkers that you're working through but in doing that you're creating something new um and thank you
yeah and i i find that that that's kind of something i've been trying to do with in my own small
way as as a neophyte in my own thinking too by simply re-articulating existing thinkers to see if
that can be something new that comes out of it yeah i've got to go back to the text and you know
and i think you know what slavoie did by reading look on with hegel i mean that's what inspired all
of us right and for me i'm very much a student of my advisor you know frank gruda who reads hegel
with badu right i'm very much influenced by his project um and so yeah you know i think
uh i think this is the this is a good way to look at it right and adrian's such a good researcher as
well i mean like he's uh i think one of the best living researchers in terms of just like explicating
like what's come before us but then he does push it forward right and he does give us a new spin
on you know his project on transcendental materialism right is uh it's brilliant um but yeah you gotta go
back to the text for sure and especially find those questions that people don't look at you
know and i think that's what the contingent choice i made that was a good contingent choice right which
was i'm just gonna look at space because no one's really looking at it yes i mean i probably should
read this out here this is quite important this is going to be the first question i was going to ask
from you but you i think we already touched on it you say so i was going to ask why does space itself
need a new ontology because you say here uh while topological theories uh and a spatial analysis
within larger ontological projects persist in contemporary literature there's not yet been an
explicit and ontological examination of space itself and this is important but particularly in the wake of
the linguistic and psychoanalytic terms of the 20th century i mean of course there's there's been
flows philosophers working on space but it's just with now with all the thinking that has been done
what's what's what new can we keep pushing it forward also with the revelations of uh of modern
physics so i found that quite fascinating um all right catherine i think this is i'm gonna ask a bit of
uh i hope i'm not prying here but a bit of a biographical question here i what got you interested in
german idealism i mean can you like to i guess to end the conversation i'd like to end it on the note
of just more of a personal account because i i mean it's really interesting there are some topics uh
you know when i when i bring them up with people who are interested in philosophy they almost like
viscerally they they were they repulse hegel is one of these people you know like i think now thanks to
zizek and kind of the libliana school that attitude is changing but you know especially like we all
know like karl popper called hegel a tyrant uh and you know bertrand russell said he has no idea what hegel
is talking about so i'm curious what got you drawn towards i mean all the way to doing your phd on
looking through like this work of again philosophy but generally a german idealism what what do you think
this period of thinking in our in human history or history of thought what do you think is unique
about it is there something and why do you think it still is pertinent to our times um so both the
personal question and a sociological question i mean like to karl popper's point right hegel's my very
good tyrant you know my master's certainly you know that i i suffer under um the only one yeah
so you know i think and i often tell this to grad students or to people exploring grad school you make
certain contingent choices and you just can't look back right and i remember thinking about all the
different thinkers i was interested in and i'm very much influenced by the libliana school and so i was
thinking very heavily about just focusing on the con uh for my dissertation and i was thinking about
doing a more like historical topic as well so like my background was in i did a lot of political
science work and was thinking a lot about the shifting nature of like space and place in like a
globalizing world like what does it mean for the world to shrink in this way i was very interested in
this kind of question and so i mean what ultimately happened was i went for like a coffee with the
modern dollar and lubliana and it was a i remember it was a really sunny hot uh summer afternoon i i envy
you i'm a huge fan of this one yeah super lucky very very lucky um and we were having a coffee by the
river and we went through you know a hundred different topics and he was so kind to advise me on
well if you choose that one you can go down this path if you choose that one you can go down that other path
and we like paid the bill we like ended the conversation off but we hadn't done the double
ending right the the second death and i turned to him and i just said should i just go for hegel and he
says to me it is the most difficult and the most rewarding and so that sort of sealed the deal for me
and then just like on a personal level i've always wanted to be taken seriously in like this field and so
i i mean just on a very yeah like you know like to share my personal kind of gripe you know i was
like if i do hegel people can't tell me i'm like full of shit like they'll have to respect me at least
a little bit to think like oh she's tackled this like very difficult thinker maybe she's done it
totally in the wrong way and i totally disagree with her but there's some chutzpah for at least tackling
hegel um so that was sort of the like the strange way i got into it um but you know i really thought
if i was going to do space and i was going to ask about like an ontology of space and i actually really
didn't start with the nature i really was just reading the logic and thinking what is logical space
before i expanded the project to look at um nature and spirit but i was really just trying to
think about space because again like to yeah kind of go back to like a you know a personal anecdote um
i was in the class with the with elinka and i remember thinking about retroactivity and time
and like up like goo and all of this and thinking this is so rad what a cool way to think about time
and there's almost like this time travel component to it and i never really thought about time in this
way before and i remember just having a really basic thought which was like what's the correlation
for space and of course there's lecon's fun non-orientable objects and all this that we
love to talk about and deploy but i suppose that you know it's like this basic question they say you
know find like the gap in the literature and i was like haha i'm just going to talk about the gap
in the literature so maybe it was a bit cheeky in this way um but yeah i think just when i really
got down to it to think about this uh tension between indifference and difference i knew i was
on to something and i was like okay there's something here to this and let's see how it expands and
you know it's uh it expanded for me in ways i didn't expect it to right and there i had a sort
of like gut inclination of like where the project was going to go but it really started to unfold for
me the more i read the more i thought about it the more you know i was reading it badu and zizek as
well like bringing their work into this project the more i felt i could contribute something to
this field of thought on a very like basic level of space excellent so i mean i've got to ask you did
you enjoy your suffering oh i enjoy it very much yeah and you know even that's all that matters
even in like those last days when i was doing my dissertation i was you know at this age very
self-aware of the anxiety and i wasn't like just in a maelstrom you know like which ways forward i'm
not sure like i was very much outside myself being like you're suffering right now and i was like okay
now just take the reins of that and like try and control it as best as you can
so yeah no it's the best suffering you know and you know one of my favorite things to do is just
get stuck on a paragraph of hegel and i know there's other people that enjoy this too and like
thank goodness there's you know i know that these other people exist right um and yeah you know just
getting stuck and you know just digging in and thinking about all the different like you know
translations etc right how we can read a certain paragraph i mean it's i don't know if you know if
todd has said this or slavoy said this uh um and i'll just credit both of them with this you know
but like reading hegel is like watching david lynch right you can sit around a table todd okay beautiful
beautiful i borrow from todd right we can sit around a table of people that all love david lynch
but we're going to have radically different opinions right i might be like oh mahol and drive is
my favorite david lynch no it's lost highway and we'll have a great debate about why the other
person's wrong right and david lynch can be read in these wildly different ways same with hegel right
we can sit around a room and be like around a table and say oh hegel's the author of completion no he's
the author of incompletion and have a really good debate based on these two radically different ways
that one can read hegel and it's very productive debate excellent so now that you're done i should
just probably say this before this if if made in dollar tells me to go you know do a phd on hegel
i'm i don't i've got the master telling me and i've got the uh yeah a very good master definitely
he's such a it's so interesting you know the libliano school the jack uh is like this bombastic loud
funny guy and then there's a punch again million dollar there's such soft spoken almost like just
the the total contrasts and i i truly i truly love learning from them i mean obviously for me
as an outsider just reading their work and listen to their talks but uh you know it i it's yeah as i
said i'm quite envious so uh i'm curious catherine um are you going to convert any of this work into more
for like a and i wouldn't even say an academic book but more like a book for the general public
um and maybe get it published yeah i'd really like to i don't have this what i want to do is i want to
let it breathe for like a year i think and come back to it because i love this project so much and it
informs everything i still do like i still can't stop thinking about space um i have a text coming out
soon ish i'm submitting it soon on a theory of historical spatiality which i did a talk on last
year um in serbia novi sad and it's online and i'm just sort of taking that talk and like uh
ironing it out a bit and so putting that into text like the thing i love about this topic on space is
that you know you can think about again like historical space political space and economic space
there's so many interesting ways that this is a very evergreen sorry come on no i mean it's an
inexhaustible topic yeah i keep interrupting no no it's okay yeah it's just it was like a great place
to kind of start and to mine into it's like there's so many implications for this research and there's
still so much more to research in it um but yeah once this little text is in i owe it to my guy in two
days which is it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna land on his desk um the the bigger project i'm
working on in this next year maybe longer than one year let's see how it all pans out um i'm working on
a project on the atom right now which i'm really excited about and it has everything we we has to
do with what we've been talking about with the idea of disentangling and entangled nature because for me
the atom such an interesting question that there is this irreducible materiality that is a building
block of nature and this is a fantasy right it's a beautiful fantasy that we'll find one day that
little thing that everything is built upon and it's material and that it's going to be you know
perfectly spherical or have hard edges right i mean there's so many ways that we can or the string
or it's just a piece of energy right um so i am working on a project on it it's called imagine
adam and that will be the next uh i think big project for me but yes i'd really love to publish
the thesis it's i feel like super grateful that people have been interested in it um i really like
it i think there's a lot to it um and so yes it is a project that i shall conquer next
love it well you've certainly won over an avid blower so i'll be i'll be the first to buy whatever
buy or or find whatever you you put out um yeah looking forward to it download it illegally online
you know do the ethical thing yeah yeah i mean i i always think you know work like this it should be
available more for the general public i mean i i hate this notion of uh dumbing down philosophy or
making for not like not popular but you know jeezek makes this point that his best-selling book
is his most dense text which is less than nothing i mean that's his best-selling book so
it's as you said there certainly are people that are willing to spend a month working on one paragraph
from uh hegel's logic i mean there are people that are willing to get to go through their work um
catherine i'm very grateful for your time thank you for sharing your work with me and uh yeah this was
a solidifying conversation thank you so much thank you so much ross such a great convo just appreciate
so much your engagement with the work and you're doing so many cool things i'm loving your channel as
well so just yes i hope we'll talk again soon
