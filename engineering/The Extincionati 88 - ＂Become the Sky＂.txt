I don't want to set the world on fire, I just want to start a flame in your heart.
So you just asked me if I had any thoughts about Jack Sarfati and, you know, we were prior to that, we were speaking about incredibly brilliant women like Sarah James, the Dream Incubator or, you know, the Onira font.
I love that word, or Onira pomp, Emory Amerigood, the Greek Mystic of China, China Kajala.
All right, there's some noise.
Can we just go into deep space?
Hello, hello, just here?
Probably that person just muted their mic.
Yep.
And that's probably Nathan.
Give me just a second.
We'll actually do the intro.
All right.
So let us take a moment together to remember all of those beings who have striven to establish a beautiful way of being on our world and on all worlds.
Those men and women and children and elders and animals and living places.
Brilliant of spirit and gentle of heart.
And also fierce.
Who strove throughout their lives to mend fundamental problems on our world, which are primarily, it appears, with humans.
They arise in our species.
So somehow at the same time as having the capacity to establish something paradisical here, our species seems fascinated with the possibility of hell as well.
And I want to remember all of those beings past, present and future who strove to become living medicine for the problems that our species so trenchantly recapitulates generation after generation.
And we gather in the hope of sustaining their vision and dream and establishing amazing and beautiful and intelligent ways to be human together.
Remembering them inspires us.
And may we serve their their dreams and passions with the same brilliance and heartful awareness that they brought to their existence and their struggles.
Oh, beautiful ones, we remember you.
So, you know, we're talking about brilliant women.
I named a few.
I'm particularly amazed at this point by Sarah Jane's work.
She has studied dreaming her entire life.
One of the things she said that I think is really brilliant is that she felt that if she could just sustain lucidity, this is really important to me because I've had a similar kind of concern.
When she was very little, she was lucidly dreaming all the time, just naturally, and she's not the only person like this.
A number of the people that have spoken with her are similar.
And as a little girl, she thought, if I can just sustain that lucidity across the barrier into waking, I will defeat death.
I will live forever.
And I think that's amazing for a number of reasons.
The first is what the children know of death anyway.
I think they don't.
I almost died once when I was a little kid and I was just curious.
I wasn't scared.
You know, I was like, oh, I'm going to die right now.
And I was like, oh, OK.
Ain't nothing I can do.
I'm going to sure miss mommy.
There wasn't any like terror or anything.
I'm like, I just fell down on the ground unconscious and, you know, started dying.
I guess it's kind of cool that I didn't have to actually die at five years old.
I was suffocating.
I couldn't breathe.
My lungs were locked up.
My mom woke up when she heard the thump of my body on the floor.
She was napping on the couch nearby.
Managed to make it out to the living room before I passed out.
She got me breathing again.
But yeah, so Sarah thought if I just learned to stay lucid all the time,
then I will never die, which is such a brilliant thought for a child to have.
Not only that, I mean, how oppositional to everything the adults are doing,
which is almost always the opposite of lucidity, right?
The waking world of human beings is the catastrophic opposite of dream lucidity
for most of us much of the time.
Now there are exceptions, you know, when we're being really loving
or we're trying to grow together or even in our, you know, in our meetings,
we at least urge on lucidity because we sort of have this agreement, right?
We start out with an agreement to try to see and remember and learn.
And even like the things that I said in the beginning of the meeting,
man, I really mean those things.
Those are not mere words to me.
My heart desperately needs a context in which to chase its origin
and the beauty of the possibility of our existence with other, you know,
people like myself in that one, in those senses.
And, you know, I've studied dreaming in my own way my entire life.
I know a lot of unique things about dreaming that I think are very uncommon.
Even in my interview with Sarah, my first one, and I hope to do another soon.
She was startled by one of my questions, which is,
what do you think the source of illumination in dreaming is?
That's a number occurred to her.
So I feel, I feel kind of excited that I was able to ask a question
that she had never yet considered about dreaming.
But I could ask her a lot of questions because I, I'm a weird, I'm a weird mind.
But yeah, she's, she's really brilliant.
And the thing about lucidity is that it, it unifies the normally distinct aspects of awareness.
And one of the things that I always wondered was, you know,
all the, the dreaming experts are talking about lucid dreaming,
but not, I, I haven't heard one of them talk about lucid waking.
Apparently this idea never occurred to them.
But it seems to have occurred to Sarah, right?
Because from, even as a little kid, she thought, apparently she thought that if she could retain the lucidity
that she normally experienced, that she commonly experienced in dreaming,
into her waking experience that she would be free from death.
That's a really trippy idea.
Now, of course, it's not actually clear that death, it's not clear that death exists.
It really isn't.
We, the death of our body exists.
That's real, that's, that's going to happen in so much as, you know, this is what we mean by death.
But the death of the self is wildly unlikely, in my view.
There's no, there's, there's almost no evidence for it.
Other than, you know, the person disappears from our experience, which seems like a lot of evidence, but isn't.
So the death of the body, that's real, for sure, but the death of this, of the being that, what is the right word, that animates, right, the being that animates the body.
Very much doubt this myself, there's so much clear evidence in my view, for that not being real.
And rather, rather than being destroyed or ceasing to exist.
What happens is a transition into a different layer.
Yeah, I think.
But yeah, it's just brilliant that she thought, if I can just remain lucid, I will defeat death.
That's awesome.
Brilliant idea.
And then, of course, you know, we find all of these traditions.
And this is going to get to something that George was saying in a recent text message.
Find all of these traditions that associate something very similar to death with healing.
Healing impossible things.
There's a story, of course, it's anecdotal.
And that during the mysteries of Alexis, right, where they would take thousands of people from all walks of life,
through an initiation.
First, they would have to purge themselves, right?
So it would be six months.
I think of abstention.
And sex.
Well, it's not hard for me, I can abstain from that forever.
Eating meat, right?
Fasting, not abstaining from fasting, but fasting.
Cold water bat bathing, a lot of sort of hardships, six months of prep.
And then you carry a piglet with you, you get a piglet.
You traverse this long path over a number of days together with the other initiates.
And then you go through this process, which is what, you know, Hillman, I don't think he actually understands the process.
But he does know that there was a way to experience death and rebirth, even though I don't know what he thinks about it.
This is one of the things I hope to ask him about, if I get a chance to talk to him again.
And he thinks, you know, this was a thing done with intoxicants or that the medusae, medusae were involved.
The medusae, I don't know how to pronounce that, A-E at the end, means plural, pluralizes the medusa.
But it's clear that there probably were substances involved.
There's a record of a man who'd been, I think he'd been blind his entire life.
And he went through this and came out with the ability to see.
It's clear that not everyone, like, right, you had to be selected to be healed.
But you had a shot at it, right, even if it was, you know, impossibly, impossible to heal injury or something.
You had a shot.
And, you know, this is a, this is a thing where you meet the divine beings.
So essentially, you're going to travel from this world to the, what I call, what I refer to as the origin world.
And that origin world, which most of us have no conscious experience of, I have experienced it.
Or I claim to have, you know, if people want to question you about it.
I have to say that compared to that, the realness of this world is trivial.
It's not real at all.
The origin world is this impossible thing.
You can be in both worlds at once.
You can be in the origin world and incarnate here at the same time.
I wouldn't be surprised if babies have this experience and then forget it as they become acculturated and in language.
I think they probably do have this experience.
I don't know what their experience during conception is.
I think they do have experience during conception.
It's unclear how that or if that's remembered.
But yeah, there's some kind of a strange amnesia that afflicts us in the process of incarnating, right?
Not just, you know, by force of incarnation, but in the process we undergo, which is a process of anolucidity, right?
Like the loss of lucidity.
And if we had lucidity, then I think it would be impossible not to sense the origin world because the thing that you call your mind is actually the spark of that world in the incarnate world.
So that means that it's as if there's a kind of lightning that's touching you all the time.
And if that lightning of the origin world were to go away, you would perish immediately.
You would certainly not be able to have awareness in my view.
I realize this all sounds theoretical, but I'm going somewhere with this.
So the ancient Greeks and other cultures, certainly Egyptians and others before them, though Hillman would like us to believe this all starts with the Greeks or the hello hello.
Hello.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
Plagians.
Yes, something like this.
The sort of the pre Greek peoples.
but no it starts way back and other cultures have known about these things but in the greeks
the mystery traditions literally take you down under the earth
you kill the piglet to symbolize before you begin you kill the piglet to symbolize the death
of the sovereignty of your human animal desires over the desires of your spirit
so your soul or origin what i call origin so the the idea is that it's sort of to flip over
so that no longer you can no longer be enslaved by the desires or the fears of your body
the um the slaughter of these piglets poor little piglets it's not merely symbolic but it's also
symbolic of putting to death um the stuff that keeps you trapped
that causes the amnesia which is mostly your human fears and your desires for
sensory pleasures right and there's a really good reason why you'd want to put those away
and the reason is that if you could even for a moment experience your soul's senses you would
never give a about any kind of pleasure you could ever have in the flesh you would not care you like
sex i don't give a food don't need that water who cares sunlight doesn't matter um there are pleasures
so profoundly ecstatically beyond anything you can imagine that the pleasures that you that we seek
the comforts that we seek in our incarnate aspect are just you could just forget about them they have
they have no meaning in the face of even a few moments of this lucidity of understanding what you are
and where you come from and who your actual family is and what your role in that family is and all of
these things um so george was saying last night i'm gonna i'm gonna ask him to sort of step in here
and and take over for for time because i've been blathering long enough um i'll just i'll just finish
up with a couple things so post initiation the successful initiates have essentially died to
they've experienced death while they're alive this is what is referred to as the second birth
that we sometimes hear about in religious traditions particularly christianity although christianity
steals this idea and reformulates it as something that you can only happen if you you know worship jesus
which i think is absurd i doubt jesus even wanted to be worshiped if jesus existed i don't think he
was like worship me and be free i don't think that's what he was talking about at all most likely
what happened is that the tenets of the mysteries of alexis were misconstrued by a small group of humans
who decided to make a power play and rip off all these ideas and then um trademark them and say you'll
die forever and be punished forever and blah blah unless you do exactly what we say and on and on and
on um but the the goal was to be absolutely free from being compelled by the animal aspects of who you
who you are as a human being and so an inversion right what happens is the soul the sort of underneath
of you right flips over and becomes on the top and the animal aspects are subjugated to it instead of
your soul powers being subjugated to your animal aspects which is miserable suffering it's like a
fish not knowing what water is and not being ever being in water right this is how most of us live
we live like a bird never having flown you know a snake never having slithered um go ahead yeah well
i think death is more like a latent potentiality within life rather than an event at the end of the
life process so death is more like an ever-present possibility within life itself so it can only be realized
within within life yeah that's brilliant yeah so you have to die while you're alive in order to
experience it it's not at the end of life i suppose that's what i mean it's actually there's no way
to die that doesn't happen in life right right yeah it's like sunrise can only happen in the nighttime
there's no other way for that to happen right yeah but but like life and death aren't separated by an
interval i suppose that's what i mean what i mean to say is that death is within life itself within the
waking experience of life it hovers over what life itself is as opposed to being at the end of life so
um to actualize death is is initiation so there's a i think there's a there's a dimension
um there's a dimension to life which when actualized uh yields this kind of occult um
influx of information which i think proceeds from this uh
uh the same force that we attribute to death that we call death there's a there's a there's a
relationship or a link there that's absolutely brilliant um obviously this is well known throughout
many traditions um in zen uh i can't remember who it was might have been sasaki roshi who said something
like um die the man who dies once on the pillow will never taste death again
all right and what he means is die to the illusory self in meditation experience the complete cessation of
that nonsense um that illusory deception uh
uh and be rescued from all you know all suffering you know then you can choose things like if you want
to incarnate again or not or what um all kinds of things yeah so
yeah well there's there's a similar relationship between light and space or light and darkness
so you know ordinarily we imagine that light and darkness are two opposite extremes or that they
exist along a spectrum but really darkness and light interpenetrate so instead of thinking that
light is propagating through space you could you could take the the opposite stance and recognize that
space itself is within light there's there's an inverse truth so i guess that's also what i mean so
so to recognize that death is within life is the same kind of act as recognizing that space is within
light there's a there's a very similar uh i think um structure there yeah most people would find that
terribly counterintuitive i don't um
um it's absolutely brilliant that you say things like this uh
you know one of the ridiculous features of human cognition is to take aspects of existence as separate
and
i guess you could imagine a box in which there's no light
right you could say like well inside this box we created a situation where it's there's no there are no
photons in there okay great but the box is in the universe how will you evict the universe from the
box okay you have the unit you know the box is already in something that is swimming in light
time space beings you know awareness intelligence all these things so you can you know you can make a
box inside which you think there's absolutely nothing right um absolute zero right but the box you made the box
so so how can you evict your making of the box from the box and the universe you are an expression of the
universe the box is an expression of the universe so you might think like no we can make nothing in
there there's nothing there there's nothing you're wrong you're just wrong there's no way to make nothing
right yeah i mean that also i think you know to some extent um
illuminates what you were saying about the um the dream world so what illuminates the dream image
right um you know so we tend to think that light illuminates an image so you know we think that
the beam of light like a flashlight in a dark room illuminates some kind of um you know spatial
or spatially extended image but you can take the opposite stance and recognize that the light beam
itself contains an image so the image is within the light it's the exact opposite you know yeah this is
yeah see this kind of intelligence is so rare it's one of the reasons i adore your mind
you're a very unique intelligence as a human being one of the most unique intelligences i have ever come
across keep going by all means and go go to the dyspepsia let's let's have the fucking comedy
yeah yeah because it's exactly what you're saying these religions weren't there to cause you to worship
beings you didn't first of all let me just be really clear about something
it is impossible to worship that which you are that which makes you and sustains you moment to moment
um it's not impossible to adore it but worship worship would be like if i constantly sang george's
praises with no having no experience of george at all right and and actually refusing to have any
contact with george so what i'm trying to get at is if you were to touch if the origin
world were to emerge even partially in your awareness you would instantly sing and dance and adore it
helplessly there's nothing you could possibly do to stop those things from happening your soul would
ring like the sun with familiarity recognition awe wonder ecstasy joy um freedom you would just your
whole being would just ring like a bell and i know this because i've experienced it directly
it's the opposite of worship you can't help it it's like a bird flying or a heart beating there's nothing
you can do that could possibly intervene in that if this were to touch your awareness while you're you know
awake or dreaming and so this idea of worship is what happens only after that goes away
right so it's like oh you put me in a prison where i can't feel my nature or origin then i could start
praying or something like worshiping um something that i have no real experience of or very little
experience of and i'm just trying to say that it's like the backwards thing you're talking about where
they think light illuminates it's of course reasonable to think the light illuminates things
but there's something that illuminates your mind without which you can't recognize light or illumination or
anything right um and so originally these uh many of these spiritual experiences were um oriented as medicine
um renewal resurrection healing the death of um the blindness of our common day-to-day waking
experience the reawakening of wonder and awe and ecstasis um and also intellect go ahead right well
this is what ties it back to coca-cola because uh john pemberton originally marketed coca-cola as an herbal
tonic it was supposed to be like a miraculous cure for all sorts of ailments like indigestion headaches
and fatigue um but over time it it basically became the product of marketing hype and i think something
similar happened in christianity you can you can actually trace the the history the editorial history
of the books of the new testament um to see how they were uh interpolated or modified and then compiled
with this clear like editorial strategy and a theological design which i think people like
alman hillman actually misunderstand to some extent like you can't read the books of the bible
independently because the theology is baked in and they were written with respect to each other
by a single group of people so uh so the theology is there it isn't something that you superimpose on
the text it's something that you're supposed to uh to glean by design um a very specific message
that you're supposed to take away from reading the text so um i think alman hillman gets that wrong but
uh what do you think he thinks
well he seems to think that the gospel of mark is a historical document or even like you know
the gospel of luke which clearly they aren't they were written probably over the span of 10 years by
maybe the same person or a single group of people so he seemed i mean he i think alman hillman is aware
that um the gospel of mark is based on homeric episodes um i think he knows about dennis mcdonald and
uh like literary mimesis or mimesis criticism um but he i think he where he airs is in thinking that
jesus performed these acts that mark describes i don't think that's like as if it's a historical
document that's not i don't think that's what it is at all um so so because mark is aware of paul
and because paul was probably an ahistorical person like a confabulated literary construct
designed by the proto-catholic church or the proto-orthodox church to counter marcionism
mark and paul have a unified theological message
and that message is centered on grounding the character of jesus in in a specific jewish context
which probably wasn't there to begin with so um basically to judaize this character to give him
a jewish genealogy to give him a place on earth because marcion you know contended that jesus was
some kind of alien that descended from space and he was a fully grown human being without a birth
narrative or without even a resurrection narrative um sort of like a like a holographic projection
so that that position was called docetism then it was called a heresy by the early church but it
seems to have been marcion's position so because marcionism was gaining popularity in the second
century the proto-orthodox church had to publish their own canon because marcion was the first to
publish a collected volume containing the letters of paul and the gospel because originally there was
only one gospel and it was paul's gospel um whereas these editors and these redactors that came later
um between like 155 and 166 a.d roughly in that window of time um yeah they came they came up with this
fourfold gospel message really as a symbolic act um because you know there are four winds and there
are four there are four pillars on the direction um and of course this this fourfold structure in the
gospels is based on hellenistic rhetoric and platonism and and stoicism uh really has nothing to do with jesus i
i mean um so so basically if you read the gospels in order as you were designed as you were supposed to
read them um you begin with matthew and then you proceed to luke through mark but this this structure
is a dialectic which has a deliberate uh purpose you're supposed to move from matthew to luke
in order to transcend the dialectic in the gospel of mark so transcending the dialectical structure
of the synoptic gospels is uh really an old motif within like the platonic dialogues it's uh yeah
it's an old rhetorical device so yeah it's it's uh it's a theologically designed polemical document
and it's directed against marcionism so
because because marcionism was like pepsi okay um just like pepsi it was bold it was disruptive
and it was increasingly popular right just like marcionism it was also stripped down and uh
like easily accessible for for the average person um because no one had to obey jewish law in order to be
a christian according to marcion so he totally rejected the old testament he thought that you
know the god of the old testament was this being called the demiurge who was effectively like what
paul calls satan when paul talks about satan in his letters um he really seems to be describing this
iconic being called the demiurge which was the same being that created humanity
uh or gave humanity these these physical bodies so like in genesis when when god clothes adam and eve
in in skins the gnostic reading of that uh that uh book of the bible
was really that skins or garments or clothing were effectively what the human body was so the human body
is like a suit or some kind of suit that you wear it is yeah you're right right so in order to so to
become a christian you have to you have to develop this like this other kind of suit which is tailored
to a heavenly ecology so when you die you acquire this new heavenly dwelling which is literally like
an astral body of some kind that can traverse a soma pneumaticon yeah precisely the soma pneumaticon yeah
yeah it's it's it's an actual body of some kind with a corporeal presence but it's it's more like
a photonic body or a body yeah i don't know if corporeal is the right word what do you mean by that word
maybe i'm misunderstanding um feel free to correct yourself if you yeah so it has some kind of elemental
presence yeah yeah yeah it's it's a mode like a ufo basically like a ufo has a corporeal presence right
okay but it isn't entirely physical okay i got you yeah it can sort of phase in and out of existence
because it's based on like the propagation of light or something yeah or the propagation of what time
space emerges from yeah precisely yeah yeah but the cola wars followed the same structure which is really
bizarre if you look at uh like the history of soft drinks and uh the competition between coca-cola
and pepsi the fact that coca-cola was losing market share in the in the in the 20th century and had to
adopt a more pepsi-like flavor in the form of new coke is precisely what happened in the second century when
the catholic church interpolated so it's it's the same god like it's the same being over and over
again it's like it's it's the demiurge or something dude like yeah but keep going that just blows my
fucking mind because the most hilarious comparison i think i ever heard in my life keep going yeah
because coke is the perfect object it's it's basically it's a god on earth so if you if you
look at coke the sense in which a bottle of coca-cola is the perfect object is that
like it basically abides by all these bizarre laws of desire and and it seems to have been manufactured
through a similar kind of process of like competition and like certain cycles of addiction or habit
formation so it's yeah it's part of inspiration under addiction yeah i'm with you go ahead
yeah right like like the inspiration that results from the most addictive thing you can possibly produce
or the inspiration that chases the possibility space of addiction in such a way as to produce
coca-cola and the bottle and the logo and you know and the marketing and all that
like if you look at the shape of the bottle itself the shape of the bottle activates certain
certain complexes in the human mind so like the shape is designed to look like the outline of the
female body right it also has certain like phallic connotations which is interesting so it functions
like this kind of totem like a like a like like a shamanic object or a like a fetish right um
actually it functions like the image of a god yeah except deprived it's the proto form of a god
right it's what you'd get if you took the human features away right and the animal features away
and you just represented the principles themselves yes well my claim is that that's what a totem is
the totem is the incarnation of a god but its incarnation usually assumes a more technical guise
eventually because the the point of origin is eventually lost or forgotten so it turns into this
utilitarian object but um i think yeah coke is sort of like in this uh holy that's what tools are yep
that's what the computers are that's what our cars are that's what our smartphones are yeah exactly
so once okay once you get past there's a process right where the god you know the the totem or the being
that is being encoded in the form of an idol as that becomes as you subtract the human plant and animal features
from it more and more eventually you get a tool and then what you get instead of those features is
function right you get the thing it does the magic thing it does i mean a watch is magical
a car is magical even a lock and a key that's a magic act right to open the way
please continue oh absolutely yeah the function of an object as a technical object is always downstream
from this more original devotional or symbolic point of origin so i think that applies to any technical
object like an automobile or a computer i think it also applies to a fork certainly yeah a knife
you know a spoon yes all that stuff right yeah i'm with you keep going
uh well yeah i mean so insofar as mark is aware of paul
and insofar as paul was probably simon magus or some kind of street magician um
yeah the books of the bible aren't historical documents they're designed to convince you of
something it's basically like a marketing campaign so it works just like coca-cola man like it's the same
exact structure like it's the real timeline like the the amount of time that it took to compile these
books i think is is um synchronous with the uh the new coke uh campaign that was that was sort of
spearheaded in response to the popularity of pepsi so it was a rapid kind of process so the books of
the bible were probably compiled over a decade they weren't written over the course of generations and
then organically compiled uh like in the third century or something the the book that we call
the new testament or the whole the whole bible really um both the old and the new as a coherent
document or a coherent book uh was probably already around by the time of marcus aurelius
in the second century so around like 150 a.d so it was it was brought together very
early but also quite late with respect to what most scholars think because most scholars think
that mark was written around 70 so soon after the the siege of jerusalem um and that the pauline
epistles were written maybe around the year 50. um but it seems more clear to me now that
the pauline letters and mark and the other gospels were were probably written around the same time
and it may have been overseen by polycarp um or irenaeus so it actually has the same kind of
structure as like art forgeries if you look at the the history of like forgeries like the hitler diaries
or how modern art forgers um create what are called twin forgeries in order to lend
themselves credence or to create these self-referential systems of legitimacy
um it's pretty clear to me that like the early church fathers were engaged in something like that
it was like um what do they call it a pious fraud so for the sake of for the sake of countering marcion
and destroying marcionism they had to confabulate these things i think that was when does marcionism show up
where's its origin between the years of like maybe 130 and uh 150 so i think yeah between between those
two or three decades marcion was in his prime and he was in rome he debated polycarp in 154 or 153
a.d yeah a.d yeah yeah um so marcion was basically teaching that the god of the old testament was evil
or satan he was the first person to publish paul's letters as a coherent sort of collection
and some of those letters are in the in the bible um but his collection actually began with galatians
not romans okay so which is really fascinating because galatians presents this schism between paul
and the other apostles um marcion seems to have taught that paul was the only true apostle and that
he had no connection to the original apostles and you can see that in galatians because paul says that
he didn't receive his gospel message from any man um in fact it was a revelatory experience for him he
never actually met jesus in the flesh he only ever encountered this heavenly vision uh or series of
visions uh he only met the apostles two or three times and they were all seemingly um like antagonistic
um and he sort of recounts that in galatians which is pretty fascinating so that seems to have been
the follow-up to mark because if you read the gospel of mark it ends rather abruptly and there's no
resurrection narrative and there's also no birth narrative so that's sort of like what marcion was
saying so later what happened is that these redactors came in and they gave jesus a jewish background
and they also tried to harmonize paul with the other apostles like in the acts of the apostles yeah
because probably what paul had written was too powerful to omit is my guess right it's like an
ingredient in in the coke right yeah it's the cocaine right it's the cocaine in the coca-cola you can't
get rid of that so you have to explain it in terms affine with your with the myth you're trying to make
well no paul was originally considered a heretic he was actually the father of all heresies he was
called simon magus so he was a polarizing figure in the early church but then they had to re they had
to rehabilitate his image so they had he was called simon magus yes um how did you is this common knowledge
how did you come to know this this is unfamiliar to me so the gnostics all traced their teachings back to
paul who was called simon magus by justin martyr um as well as in the pseudo clementine writing um yeah
the pseudo clementine recognitions uh contain a lot of information about simon magus and so the catholic
church or the proto-orthodox church um seems to have conflated this figure that we now call paul with
simon magus who was the father of gnosticism so and how would you um i don't mean to interrupt please
keep going i have a question though
so the only place where simon magus appears in the bible is in the acts of the apostles and he's framed
as this person this individual this magician who was um really in opposition to peter and if you read
galatians you'll see that that's precisely who paul was so whoever paul was he basically paul was never
a historical person in the sense that you know paul may have went by that name i think paul is some kind
of literary construction not unlike jesus himself like an amalgam of several people sort of like santa
claus like santa claus is an amalgam of several different people he's not yes you know
so viewing viewing paul and jesus as these composite ideological constructs makes sense of the history of
this whole movement because because similar phenomena have have recurred in history it's not
just that jesus never existed it's that you know people like ned lewd never existed or you know king
arthur it's king arthur right it's like king arthur no one thinks that king arthur was a historical
person very few people do but irrespective of that the same process was at work because
the same socio-political process took place in different parts of the collapsing roman empire
so in england the collapse of the roman empire yielded this legend of king arthur whereas in the
near east it yielded this legend of jesus but i think it was the exact same process that gave rise to them
and that's the process of knowledge they don't they don't go that far say to say that again please
most mythicists don't go that far they don't see the connection between jesus and king arthur or
or the cargo cults that that developed in the 20th century as a function of military invasion and so
on like that's what the roman empire was doing and that's i think how these figures became historicized
retroactively they were sort of retroactively historicized uh-huh so it's um
okay so now what we have is you take some kind of a basic ideological doll right the doll of a messianic
being um a rescuer a reincarnator in fact you're actually taking it could be understood that you're
taking the doll of the oneropomp or the um psychopomp operant in for example the mysteries of alephsis i'm
using maria marigou's pronunciation she's actually greek and demands that we pronounce it properly
and i'm fully willing for really important reasons um you're taking something like
uh almond hillman's medusa right the one that introduces the other world in death death to the
lie right which is one of the things that almond is profoundly motivated
and is is fairly certain that he's accomplishing right he's trying to kill a bunch of lies that's
what he thinks he's doing um so you take the stall of the lie killer right and then what you do is you
just dress it up historically um mythologically textually you do this by stealing entire histories
right you judaicize jesus you kingify arthur um and so what you do is you wrap this coke bottle right you
wrap the coke bottle until it looks like something familiar to the people you want to enchant with it
yes yes yes precisely yeah and then it becomes the real thing yes yeah exactly right because things
aren't real there are no real things reality belongs to origin not things go ahead
if you look at the um yeah the old coke advertisements uh with the with the songs and the jingles
you can you can see you can see the christian element like or it's the same it's the same force
it's the same force either way yeah so how do you sell brown sugar water that's the question
like how do you make brown sugar water the real thing that's you know
i mean brown sugar is pretty amazing all by itself so it's probably you don't have a big job
right it's not going to be real tough you just get people to taste that brown sugar water
it mostly takes care of itself so then one of the things you do is just add some cocaine
it's a stimulant right it's a stimulant that that's exactly what it is right yes
so it feeds into these cycles of addiction so it's a feedback loop it's its own support
all of this has to do with counterfeiting origin for the sake of um creating
systems of authority in human persons and cultures
others right so that um some group or person can be authorized
by people outside right right exactly it's an authorization con
which is exactly the opposite of what was going on in alexis
there was no con it was the opposite of a con i think
yeah the taste of coke is both bitter and sweet but you also forget the taste of coke quickly so
you can you can have more than one coke in a day but but you because you quickly forget the taste
you find yourself drawn back and the suds the fizz yeah the fizz the fizz actually releases endorphins
so it's it's really just an experience of pain that's what the that's what the fizz actually induces
so it releases these endorphins that that people find pleasurable but it's just a pain receptor really
really fascinating but i think christianity has a similar kind of uh kind of structure
say more
yeah well you know most christians i think implicitly agree with marcion
in the sense that in my experience like most christians that i tend to meet
um they they usually just reject the old testament entirely
but the pleasure that attends being a christian right or you know loving jesus or whatever the case might be
um really seems to be
about like swapping or trading these subjective impressions so it sort of works like um like beelzebub so
so what most people call jesus
is really no different from from the lord of the flies or beelzebub because in the bible beelzebub was used as this kind of uh
uh like this uh like a meditative aid so you can imagine how like uh someone who
who meditates on like the buzzing of a fly's wings or any insect
can use this kind of noise as a vessel for their own enlightenment it works just like a rorschach test and
the whole bible is like a rorschach test but if you meditate on babbling water or you know the the sound
of a bug's wings flapping you'll start to see certain patterns but those patterns emerge out of your own
your own mind basically they're they're a reflection of your own identity so you're seeing an aspect of
yourself in the noise it's it's basically just chaos it's just like an interference pattern out of which
this holographic projection emerges right um and that's what i think most christians are doing when
they read the bible they're they're looking at a bunch of white noise because you know the bible
contains all sorts of contradictions and it's not internally consistent but as you as you move through
it you're basically just engaging in a self-imposed rorschach test and you see aspects of your own
identity reflected back at you and that can be therapeutic i think um but it's really no different from
you know worshiping beelzebub because that's what the shamans were doing i mean they were just
they were listening to the the lord of the flies and the lord of the flies would give them information
upon meditating on the interference pattern i mean it's just you know so um but that's exactly what like
the fizz it's it's exactly like what what takes place in worshiping this coke bottle basically it's it's
it's no different um i'm having trouble at the moment trying to figure out whether what you're saying
is like profoundly enlightening or a kind of pure um cynical nihilism
i can't tell you have anything to say about that
well i mean history is repeating itself so you can you can read that nihilistically i suppose
i mean if you were repeating itself then there might be cause to be cynical i suppose but i'm that's not
really my angle okay great i'm glad to hear that because i i mean personally i'm not big on cynicism or
or nihilism um i tend to believe in a meaningful and profound um understructure to existence
it's not it's my belief it's it's not a thinking thing it's more like the thing that makes thinking
possible for me you know like like an origin thing um no what i'm describing i think exists
in the sense that like it has some kind of metaphysical relevance or physical relevance to me
um it's like a control system so the control system recurs it has certain ways of hemming
intelligence in um but i don't think it's localized to the human mind or the human body
but when i when i describe these relationships that's really what i'm trying to get at i'm trying
to get at this more general force yeah this control system is very interesting it's something
that occurs across a broad range of thought and literature um i'm particularly thinking about
uh the black iron prison of philip k dick
um a system of social control that obscures the true nature of reality
uh i don't know how familiar with dick's work you are of course um the work of actual dicks
is our own bodies but i mean philip k dick
i know more about his life than i do anything about his his writings unfortunately
yeah it's fine um though i strongly recommend uh reading valis if nothing else
um
which is an acronym standing for vast active living intelligence system
yeah i think i think philip k dick was a true mystic
oh he was um
yeah he was uh his exegesis is pretty pretty mind ripping
um and stands among stands out uh as a truly incredible
i don't even know what to call it a transcendental
it's okay so it's you know we would say well it's just a text dude it's a book it's not really a book
it's not really just a text um it is possible to compose things in text
that transcend the possibilities of ordinary text
and um thereby transform the category of the object
into something transcendental of course this is what uh
uh this is what we this is what it is said the bible and the quran and the torah and so forth
the difference though i think i don't know i know the story of how the quran was composed
the quran was composed i don't know how it was actually composed
the bible is weirder the bible is definitely frankensteinian right it's some bunch of stuff
stitched together it seems very obviously that's to me do you do you see it similarly
uh yeah i do more or less yeah i mean i think the bible has a unified message but it contains
contradictions which is yeah really fascinating well it's not just that it contains contradictions
it's that it's stitched together yeah it wasn't like some people sat down over the years
in in generation after generation and composed this one document that could thereby be essentially univocal
um it's a much weirder it's it's an assemblage right it's uh what do they call those pieces of
art where you just you know you just put different things into it
collage uh yeah there's a more complex word like a french word i think that means like um
to knit together disparate kinds of objects
uh i'm just i can't find it in my vocabulary
um the exegesis which is i think over 3000 pages of material written mostly by hand by philip k dick in
the aftermath of a religious experience that i think lasted less than a few hours
um was definitely helpful for me
obviously after reading something like that like like many people would
i i began to hope that's that like that i could somehow understand what would generate such an
experience how could i have an experience like that um
i certainly did not believe or realize that it was possible for me to have such an experience i
didn't think that was possible nonetheless i wanted desperately uh to have such an experience
and
much to my surprise i eventually had an experience that you know i think
i don't know was like a thousand fold unless what what dick experienced unless um what dick experienced
was just exactly the same thing compressed into a much smaller uh temporal interval
and certainly very similar although i was less inclined to try to understand the black iron prison
and much more inclined to try to understand um features of the historicity of the development of
consciousness in our species that led to the problems that we struggle with and experience uh today
and you know throughout human history it's going on forever essentially
um but yeah the exegesis is very trippy there's like a 900 page book now there used to be i have a
bunch of books about it right there was this book called um uh in pursuit of valis selections from the exegesis
um and i had that before uh the exegesis edited by pamela jackson and jonathan lethem was available
that book is um enormous i mean how many pages is it let me look is it like a thousand
yeah it's 950 pages long and someone recently i know we're getting a bit off topic here we can return
to the to the core shortly but somebody recently i came across i think he was lying but i'm not positive
he was lying um he claimed to have a 25 volume leather bound edition of the entire uh exegesis
i can't find any evidence of that existing um so i think he was lying uh or you know having me on
i was really he was a really trippy cat very very intelligent person musician um
um you know i guess what i'm trying to understand george is how you see the bible because you talk
about it on the one hand in the sense of it being sort of white noise that since it is incoherent since
it's fundamentally incoherent or as you said chaotic um you can get anything you want out of it it seems
this seems to be one of the ways you understand the bible am i reading that well no it looks like chaos
but it is coherent okay so like um like an interference pattern looks chaotic but an
interference pattern contains an image just like a beam of light so
so the contradictions are more like a balancing act just like um in shakespeare so in a shakespearean
play characters present opposing points of view which nevertheless constitute a unified work
so the bible is quite similar to that kind of but we are also similar to that
i am similar to that yes right this is why yeah this is why uh um methods like internal family systems are
particularly useful or effective it seems to me because they take into account this uh multiplicity
right like there seems to be a sort of a dichotomy a fundamental dichotomy between the unity and the
facets that comprise it and if you go with the facets it looks like babbling multiplicity and if you go with
the unity it looks like univocality
it's neither right yeah yeah right is it particle is it wave oh god yeah well the bible contains its own
uh cancellation within itself so yeah the bible contains its own opposite within itself
mm-hmm i guess that's what i mean by contradiction so it's yeah i mean i'm i think that's how i am too
right yeah and that's that's yeah that's how it propagates
so the gospel of mark is like the atheist text so it contains atheism within it and in fact christianity
is probably the result of atheism if you go back to um the pre-socratics and the actual genesis of
monotheism as i think omen hillman tentatively suggests
monotheism is probably downstream from pre-socratic monism which was associated with rejecting
the existence of the gods like zeus because it was really bound up with understanding the weather
and meteorology and other natural phenomena without appealing to the authority of the gods
and i think socrates and plato mediated that transmission to what we today call judaism but
um i think judaism was probably the result of this platonic um ambience in um in the hellenistic
world so so judaism is much younger than we usually suppose and and the the gap between judaism and
christianity is much narrower than we usually suppose so they're they they both originated in the same
crucible it's not as if christianity necessarily stemmed from judaism i think that's i think that's a mistake
they were like siblings that that had the same parent if that makes any sense
so i want to bring us in a direction briefly where we carefully examine
a feature of our own moment to moment awareness and experience it's an organ
in the anatomy of what i'm going to call consciousness right to be awake and aware
and it functions very differently um if we are asleep and dreaming
uh from what we will experience when we are awake and this organ is the organ of authorization
i think if you look back over recent uh speakings it's not the word i wanted but i'll use it
um in our conversation now you will discover including uh in this moment while i am speaking right now
that in order to speak something i must authorize it within myself i have to believe that it is useful
i have to have some way of believing that is useful true or important good desirable something right
and in order to do that this requires a system within my awareness that authorizes it
is this clear at all what i'm saying yeah i think it's clear okay so i want us to pay attention to
the functioning of that system for a moment you will notice that in order to admit the statement i just
made i want us to pay attention to the function of that system i must first authorize that statement
i will not admit those words if i have not first authorized them is that clear
yes great yeah excellent so you can see that there is a fundamental system that is operating beneath our
ordinary awareness we use it every time we make a move in consciousness every time we
um enact our consciousness we enact it it's not just there it's not like we're swimming in the water
and so we're always wet that's not what happens especially not while we're awake something a bit
more like that happens while we're dreaming um but while we're awake prior to engaging in an act of
consciousness and particularly the act of speaking uh there is usually beneath our awareness a system that is
functioning a system of authorization and what's going on historically you can see this happening
is that there's a transfer of authorization um from wow okay
i'm not sure i can imagine that there's a transfer from something like um ambient communal consensus
right we together what would we all most desire and agree to right if if we are 50 people in a tribe or something
what would we all most desire and agree to um that could be the original source of authorization of
of course there must be layered arrays of authoritative aspects to human awareness
activity and so forth um so that the sky right the sun the sun is blatantly obvious authority
um if it should change slightly everything dies or life becomes extremely difficult um whether it's too
hot or it's too cold you know things are going to go wrong um the moon clearly is an authority
um similarly the stars so forth but what i'm getting at is there was a transfer over time
of authority from living fundamental aspects of our existence our existence and experience like the sun the moon stars the mountain
the river um the moon cycles right not just the moon the cycles of the moon
um um the women's cycles in their bodies uh the cycles of um emergence flourishing and senescence
in the land and the living places and the animals and the insects and all these things which were immediately
concrete to our human experience not like they are for us moderns where we know they happen
somewhere but they don't much happen in our cities which have mostly evicted all of that and made a bunch of dead structure
um so what i'm getting at is that eventually what happened is that authorization started to become
personated as gods and then sometime later
this weird personation thing i love this word by the way to personate this personation thing
we threw away the facets which were the gods asclepius zeus poseidon athena demeter persephone
um aphrodite athena cleo cory um just you know to go with the greek pantheon part of the greek pantheon
we threw all that away and then we just um decided not we that's the wrong word it wasn't we didn't make
any decisions what was happening was a process in the in the development of communal human um thought
systems right that underlie this sort of encompass us rather than emerge from any person but one of the
evolutionary problems was this concept of monotheism where the authority becomes effectively
dis personated right it's no longer personated as zeus or hermes or you know um medea now
it's depersonated and you have the coke bottle right the coke bottle of monotheism yeah no one will know
his name you cannot know his shape he is featureless but the source of all features
his abstract authority absolute infinite in unknowability as he is in power omniscient omniscient
omnipresent right uh tear it up go wherever you want to go this is the first time i've seen this
in my mind yeah precisely yeah the god of paul or the god of christianity is really an unknown god of
love that was what paul seemed to be preaching so he was he was espousing something like apophatic
or negative theology the idea that god the all-powerful god
is devoid is devoid of predicates sort of like the idea of the one in neoplatonism or in plotinus
the transcendent unity that
governs
governs almost physically the uh the lawfulness of the terrestrial sphere so when paul looked at the
earth i think what he probably saw was something like the lawfulness of elemental interactions so he
he he refers to the archons that um control
the planet as these demonic forces or satan
um
but he also seems to espouse this notion of ether or this more heavenly domain so like in in aristotle
for example the terrestrial sphere was separate from the celestial sphere
and the lawfulness of this yes yes fear was eternal and it was governed by certain cycles
um whereas the elements on earth are more rectilinear they um they they flow from these cosmic forces
that descend from the stars um and this was also an alchemical motif the idea even in stoicism
of these um rational seeds uh that descend from the heavens so so the idea of the logos
was was was ultimately transmitted by stoicism to people like polycarp who who was um active in asia
minor where the bible was probably compiled um and the gospel of john was i think uh sort of bound up
with this stoic understanding of physics so yeah so stoic physics i think is the ultimate teaching of the bible
in in the gospel of john you're supposed to read the gospel of john after progressing through the
synoptic dialectic these these first three books that form a trinity um the fourth book is this more
transcendent level and i think that was a deliberate rhetorical device but um yeah so paul seems to have
thought that the resurrection body was this heavenly body which was exempt from the law that was the
whole point of christianity so as a christian you were exempt from the law because you possessed this
heavenly astral dwelling or or clothing like a space suit or something um yeah through which you could
basically judge the world so when paul talks about it's an expression body it's an expression body but
please continue sorry yeah yeah yeah so when paul talks about judgment when he talks about how human
beings will eventually judge the angels and judge the earth what he seems to be referring to is this um
this astral agency so in the same way that the stars govern the motion of the terrestrial elements
the photonic body of the elect will govern something about the motion of you know the terrestrial
elements on earth in time during the parousia so when you know when jesus comes back because paul thought
that jesus would actually come back from the heavens he was some kind of et basically who was going to come
back and and transform the entire material plane so so the whole material plane would be metamorphosed
it would be transformed that was what he was saying so it's really only intelligible in this broader context
of how the ancient greeks understood the elements in their interactions and there was also an alchemical dimension
to it because the alchemical dimension was also bound up with the transmission of these astral seeds or
these astral forms in order to transform material bodies that was the whole point of the alchemical work
or the alchemical opus and so there's a very clear link between gnosticism and the alchemical tradition
in egypt um around the third century a.d so sometime after paul um yeah so when we talk about the law
or judgment in christianity we're really talking about a physical process that that i think paul was was
was aware of it's not like this abstract you know legalistic uh no it's um basically a transformation
of something resembling the laws of physics yes and this all makes sense to me experientially because
um i i mean this is gonna sound weird i kind of don't care this is one of the one of the reasons
we do this one of the reasons we get together is so that we can say the things that we ache to say
but ordinarily we are not in the context where it is either possible that they will be understood
or that they will not just be outright rejected but in any case after that long and bizarre apology
what i'm going to say is
okay i'll start out somewhat didactically so it strikes me that there are two kinds of texts historically
there are texts that were written by humans who had direct experience of divine matters
and they wrote from that experience but they could not write without okay this is one of the weird
things when you have an experience which is outside it is from beyond your normal array of experiences
and it is from beyond what humans normally will speak of or write of together then you are challenged
i know this firsthand to determine how you will interpret the experience and whether or not
you will adopt authority from existing traditions that what i said there is really important
because if you don't adopt authority from existing traditions you will have to establish authority for
the first time on your own for your narrative or your description or you know whatever it is you
hope to reveal to the humans and this is fundamentally problematical it's an aspect of something that happens
every single time in history that humans have experience that is from outside the narrative structure of familiar
models of the world existence the divine holy and so forth you have to do one of two things essentially
you have to either adopt authority from existing narratives and say you know i am the new
jesus right i will tell you i'm writing the third testament right or you have to just do
you know your own damn thing and even if you read dick's exegesis you're going to see him doing the same thing
right what he ends up doing is talking about his experience in um christian slash gnostic terms
so first realize that right you you have to basically i mean almost all in fact representational cognition
is a game where authority existing authority structures are acknowledged modified um fossilized
and transferred across generations this is what alfred korzybski calls time binding
um all right so there's that but here's what i'm going to try to say
more or less ex cathedra from the chair of direct experience when toy maker was with my mind
um it was unlike anything i ever imagined possible i know i always say this but i really mean this in
a deep way i never imagined anything like this was possible i was driven by forces in my emotional
my psyche was replaced by something that i absolutely trusted
and i could see what was wrong and never do it i i was it was like i became pure law is required for blind
people you need law if there are idiots right if the inner sun that would normally naturally
rescue you from stupidity and viciousness and wrongdoing most of which is really just just
ignorance right it's not like i don't i don't know if i believe in the existence of evil
toy maker didn't really show me things about evil what he showed me was occlusion of the divine occlusion
of the divine is the only explanation you really need though you can use the the toys of evil and
things like the demiurge and stuff he told me stories of what he called the first angel
showed me stories of this angel which is not evil in fact there wouldn't be anything
at all if that angel didn't exist there would be nothing so there's no organ of existence that
you can do away with and now everything's good um what you can do away with is is the absence
of the inner sun naturally you will not it would never occur to you to go against it if it is shining
in your heart it's just like um water making you wet right you can't imagine unwetness if you're just
always wet in this way so to speak and so what i'm getting at is what is freed from laws by in my view
anyway from my direct experience of something i know to be divine you don't have to believe me i'm
not trying to convince you i'm just speaking from my own experience and anyone who's listening i'm not
asking you to believe me right i'm just talking about what i remember in my own words
i was free from laws in that you need laws primarily when you you were catastrophically
like in various indigenous cultures throughout history not all of them um the unity of the people
was so profound that the idea of having rules was ridiculous they would never consider it there was no
such thing as a rule in many cultures including those some of those around the great lakes when
the french encountered them um they had nothing like the formalization of laws and even in my
interview with almond hill and one of the funny points is when i talk about like
you know you and i are friends we don't have to have an agreement that you won't kill my children
that you won't steal my house that you won't like rape my wife we don't we're friends we don't have to
like there's something that pervades over our relational space that's inherently there without
being stipulated and part of the reason i know this is from before toymaker it's from when i was little
and when i was little it never occurred to me to try to hurt another child ever
my father had to threaten me right he's like you can if that boy hits you and you don't hit him
i'm gonna hit you so you figure out which person you want to with right this is what my dad
i'm saying right i mean in my father's defense he was very concerned that i wouldn't be able to um
that i would be bullied because i was sensitive he was and that i wouldn't be able to stand up for
myself so he was very worried about this he wasn't just a demon uh the way that that sounds but yeah
so there there is a thing where um there's a feature of our nature and our origin and our being
as humans that is it's hard for me not to use this word even though it's very unclear what this word
means it is perfect and it is not perfect in that it is achieved as perfection
it is perfect in that a it does not veer from the direction of beauty and truth and
the depth of its beauty and truth is infinite so it's it's not achievable right you cannot be it
it's a way of traveling in relation in being in development in seeing all of these things okay
that's the end of my homily thank you for bearing with me
this is not science fiction actually the fiction is the that we're ex while we're awake that is
lie it's just basically lying and you can lucidify the lying with acts of intelligence insight awareness
creativity play experiment rescue medicine love kindness right you can lucidify the blindness
with these things you can you can become medicine and i like to think that in our meetings when we're
when we're doing something amazing i think we're doing pretty good today in my you know evaluative
fucking whatever um then we're approaching something that more or less resembles our
our potentials for being not merely human but for being true what are your thoughts
oh yeah i think so
yeah i think this is what most christians understand by justification
by faith alone as opposed to good works right because that was the whole point that paul was trying
to make say more about that point clarify it for us please
well paul was saying that no one needed to abide by the law anymore no one needed to do good works
because the law was an effect of transgression
so so so the law pertained to living within a body of flesh i mean that was what paul seemed to be
saying so human beings were forced to live in suits of skin by virtue of some primordial transgression
which was originally disembodied i think that's i think that's actually what paul was saying
what do you mean by that last part that was originally disembodied what does that mean i don't
understand yet but adam and eve were like angels which acquired bodies after transgressing so the
return to the angelic state or something like it was what um christ affected as this um
second obviously oh yeah god okay so obviously there's a bunch of obvious things here and one
of them that i'll just state briefly and then please continue is that christ is the tree of life
right christ is the tree of life that the angel was set with a spinning sword with a sword that spins in
every direction he is the food of transcendence he is to be eaten yes yeah yeah right yeah you have to
eat him yeah yeah so paul was referencing genesis and other books uh for sure but genesis there's no way
genesis is judaic no way that that's a stolen story it's missing most of its content yeah i mean you'll
notice that even genesis contains two uh creation accounts which yeah we're already we're already doing
the frankenstein thing right we're like we're trying to stitch something together from lost pieces exactly
yeah and genesis also contains two sources of light so the light of the first day and the light of the
fourth day so there was some kind of primordial light source which wasn't the sun or the moon or the
stars that genesis describes so you can see these mirror images that crop up from the very beginning
and that carry through the entire bible i mean so i guess that's what i meant earlier by claiming that
these contradictions are somehow also unified it's like a hall of mirrors
i don't know if it's a hollow well i'm not sure what makes it a hall of mirrors
i agree with the with the contradictions and their unity
um okay what the was i thinking jesus was the tree of life right because when they okay so first of all
when toy maker i asked the main questions i asked toy maker the whole time i was with him were like
show me more about genesis show me again keep showing me show me the next story show me another one
right and so i learned astonishing things about the story and the reason that i asked a lot about that
is because it seemed to me that whatever happens at the tree of knowledge is the fundamental problem
for our people and if we could understand that we could make medicine for it also it should be obvious
that if you were moses or whoever was writing the story about the tree incident one thing you definitely
you would do two things most likely the first is you would encrypt the story so that it would be a
a weapon that would injure your enemies the enemies of your children and your people you would encrypt it
right you'd put poison in there so that especially if you if your people have been persecuted right or
enslaved or something you you would know that your enemies first of all you're going to write this
down so your enemies are going to get the book eventually right and you don't want to give them your
power so what you'll give them is like stuxnet right you'll make a virus and this is something
that humans ignore about the bible and they don't get it even though it's blatantly obvious
those books destroy cities right they make cities attack each other and kill each other
and cities are the enemies of any nomadic people that keeps getting enslaved by them so i'm just going to mention that
the first thing you would do is you put weapons in there that would cause your enemies to kill
themselves or each other and to not mess with your kids because they're too busy each other up
and then the second thing you would not do is you would not tell your children and your grandchildren
the following you would not say once things were beautiful and good then we did a bad thing
and from now on you're fucked that's not what you would do what you would do is you would say
a bad thing happened a difficult thing happened a difficulty was introduced and here's the medicine
for that difficulty but you would encrypt it so that only your children could understand it
this is my sense of what is going on in the tree instant after talking at great length with angels about it
it right it's a story that contains the medicine for the problem it's not just oh the bad thing
happened now you have to wait for the messiah to come someday and he'll fix you no no no no no um
all right so now that i've got that out of my out of my my ma what comes next um
so you know knowledge
is partly a kind of death
when god says in the bible when we read in the bible in genesis in english that god says um
don't eve that tree in the midst of the garden saying something very complex
it's not actually that there's a tree in the garden that's not what it is although one of the
things he's saying that could be understood this way um oh god should i such i tell this story
yeah yeah okay holy shit yeah i now see this for the first time i'm actually having insight at the
moment um
no i don't know if i want to go through all of this it's complicated and it might
i'm not sure if it's useful i'll just say it really briefly the first angel punched a hole in
the origin world and that hole led into the world of material existence and that's what could be understood
as the demiurge it's the cutting angel and what it does is it cuts a hole
in the origin world which is above time and matter and that hole becomes both a fountain
and the possibility of incarnation for aspects of the divine it's as if um
the hole causes in heaven quote unquote a kind of a rain and the rain that falls into that hole become
stars and beings down here so it's it's both it's like a reverse fountain and that could be understood
as the tree of knowledge not an actual tree also it could be understood that the proto form of the earth
where that will be severed because nothing cannot be severed from origin has to be severed to exist
origin is non-existence so
for something to exist it has to be severed and where you were severed is your umbilical cord but the earth
the proto form of the earth before the earth existed the possibility of the earth
it had to undergo this kind of severing
and the tree of knowledge can be understood as the umbilicus where the earth was previously
connected to heaven and where the separating angel is and when god says don't eat of the tree in the
midst this word midst in hebrew it comes from a a triconsonal root tavek very few people know this
almost no one i didn't learn this from a human i learned this from toy maker it comes from tavek and
tavek does not mean midst it doesn't mean in the middle it means to cut apart to put apart to separate
so when he says don't eat of the tree in the midst of the garden he's saying don't eat of the tree
where the separation is this is absolutely crucial if you want to understand the story
because the concept of separation is the primary problem in human cognition
it is what gives you power it's also what blinds and cripples you because you think separation has
primacy right it's just like the problems we were talking about earlier george with life you think
oh light is a separate thing when that's impossible there's no chance of that being true
it's only true in cognition where you can cut apart the elements of being and then reflect upon those parts
and then think about well how do they fit together yeah how do you fit them together
oh well no there is no together there's only unity right i know i'm getting kind of excited here so
then you have next to that this is do not eat of the tree of life or you will die this is what's
important knowledge is a kind of death knowledge is dead inside potential for what would have become
insight adoration relation resurrection wonder awe play creativity experiment why experiment because the
material universe is incomplete we complete it by being in it by being as it we don't we don't complete
it as in we finish it right we complete it in the inspired improvisation
of existence and relation wonder and learning that's what completes it right it's beautiful to have
amnesia because then you can play your way back to insight this is what i mean by completing
so knowledge is a kind of dead thing right it's not like relation um it's not like kissing it's like a
photograph it's a structured dead thing in consciousness it's a fossilized remains
if okay if you could choose between knowledge and insight what you would always choose is insight
because insight is like wait what oh my god whereas knowledge is like oh yeah that's a car
well one of those things is dead every time you look and you go like that's a car your mind dies right
there it just dies into its previous forged constructs you see how that really is a kind of death so god
is right what he's telling them is if you meet the angel that makes cuts in the manifold of existence
it will give you its toy its toy is a knife it's a knife in your mind and thereafter you will become
fascinated by making cuts and you will forget unity and you will die into incarnation you'll die into
incarnation you'll become material you will suffer the amnesia of material incarnation you'll forget
your origin in nature and you won't die actually because what will happen is essentially your spirit
will undergo a weird process where it dies into bodies and then it slowly may or may not undergo anamnesis
right the unforgetting and then conceivably here's where things get really interesting for me
conceivably you will experience what is called um the second birth but it's actually the second death
because what dies is the amnesia the amnesia dies and you are resurrected while incarnate yeah exactly
yeah right you're resurrected while incarnate which is the goal of the elificinian mysteries it's the
promise of christianity however bizarrely forged the packaging is right the wrapping paper of that stuff
is way crazy weird and and you know confusing as hell but the weird thing about even christianity is
that if you just tell people that it's possible to be born again that might be enough to get the moving
in that direction even if the wrapping paper is all confusing does that make any sense yeah absolutely so
you can you can have a religion that is completely wrong right it's just a bunch of lies
and yet a bunch of lies can still lead people to authentic real re-divinization right the re-divinization
of the human which is what maria margu the greek mystagogues book is about the divinization of man
through the ellisonian mystery process which is meant to put to death the blinding pervasive
uh black iron prison in philip k dicks you know uh nomenclature
put that to death and to re-establish the sovereignty because you actually die right you die to
your humanity and this is what i experienced during toy maker i don't claim to be special
i don't claim to be accomplished i'm not making any claims about me i don't care i'm a human being
just like you are i have had experiences that i do not understand i will be the first to tell anyone who
asks me they go like do you know what happened to you i know but i can talk about what happened to me
through a variety of frameworks and i remember what it was like and still today when i experience
insight what i call insight which is the revivification the resurrection of the possibilities
of my intelligence beyond the knowledge that i've had previously
and somehow when we get together and do what we're doing here this invokes that process for me which is
part of why i come here which is what i think church is supposed to do but doesn't mostly
yeah so i don't know what happened but i remember i have memories of my experiences and what it was
like and what it was like was to be mostly in the world of actual intelligence insight origin and adoration
and only very partly in my humanity
um and the promise of this okay so oh yeah right both people were telling the truth so god says
eat of the tree of knowledge you will die and the serpent who's not satan right it's not called satan
it's not the adversary it's a serpent it's very important because the serpent
it's not fundamentally evil it's not even bad once again without the serpent you got nothing and what
you don't want is to have just the origin world or just the universe as we know it that would be
miserably horrifying you don't want that what you want is those two things together because when they
are together that is profoundly beautiful and amazing even though the possibility of amnesia
uh comes to life in that situation um it's really profound what happens because now that rain that
comes down into existence from the origin world in this model that i'm playing with in this toy i'm making
of it now that rain can become enriched in a way that is impossible if it simply remains in the origin
world hopefully that makes sense it can become enriched by the adventure of incarnation which is
impossible in the origin world can't have that there's no adventure up there um all right so the devil
says no you won't die you will become makers of worlds and both people are right god is right you will die
the devil is right you will not die your spirit can't die right so what will happen is you'll undergo
death of incarnation you'll die to your origin self and you'll become incarnated and thus blinded and
misery and miserated though you'll still experience things like beauty and passion and dreaming and
wonder and learning and love and all of the virtues right you'll you'll see the night sky oh my god right
the the mountain the river the the praying mantis the octopus the pot of dolphins the beehive all those
flowers you'll see the incredible body of origin emerging all around you as nature and that's
really profound and also i mean there is an analog of that there's a metalog of that that happens in
the origin world and there's also a between world right there's a world where um there's a world so to
speak a universe like origin there's nothing there it's it's i can't explain it i've seen it it's impossible
for me to make words about it but then there's an interim a liminal world between that world and our
universe where souls exist as beings and there's a world above that too where it's mostly like archons
and angels and so to speak there's different ways of thinking about it but all i was trying to say is
that both people are right god is right you will die knowledge will kill your your memory you'll become
very fascinated by knowledge okay here's what that's what happens to us when we're born right
we're born without knowledge okay and then as we develop language and representational cognition we
lose contact with the origin world you can look in the child in the eyes of an infant you will see
the origin world alive boom the companion is still with the child you can see it it's right there you may
not think of it that way but you will see it right it looks like the infant looks like it's from another
universe when you look in its eyes you can see there's another universe and then as it starts to
become representational that those relationships become inhibited and scleric sclerotic they're clogged
and what they are clogged by is the child's emergence into physicality and it's undergoing of the processes
of in languaging and enculturation the enculturation of the humans to live in a culture of objects and
systems and structured lies well ordinarily i think of knowledge is the opposite process so you can think
of knowledge as a mode of forgetting um if you experience knowledge as something like uh like a bag of
marbles that you carry around and deploy like you know certain propositions or factoids um but i i i
experience knowledge more in terms of what you were describing as um as complete completeness or completing
the being itself so when you come to know a being you complete it in a certain sense which i think
anyone does even even someone you know presumably in ignorance um yeah but i think i think more in
terms of turning back or reversing the arrow of time like that's what i that's how i tend to think of
knowledge knowledge is maybe in in my experience different from what you're describing but i can see
okay okay i can see what you're saying too and i agree um both things can be true
uh again right just like i was saying god says don't eat of that tree you'll die the devil says
no you're not gonna die they're both right okay um and what it hinges on is is the meaning that we
associate with death and in our case mine and yours it's the meaning that we associate with knowledge
and obviously if you thought knowledge was if you thought knowledge was death
most of the activity that you engage in you would stop doing
yeah well okay let me because you yes yes but see this is the thing for you knowledge is an amnesis it
is unforgetting the lies that built up over history yeah right right and i agree i agree
when you complete a being the completion of the being takes place in perception but then that
perception opens a window to everything else that's what i'm calling knowledge i suppose so knowledge
to know one thing is simultaneously to know all things in disguise you just don't remember it
i guess that's what i'm saying wait say that last part again please to know one thing is simultaneously
to know all things but you don't remember all things so that's that's what i'm calling knowledge
it's this process that's fucking amazing bridge but yeah see this is the thing you're using knowledge
more in the term um excuse me more in the um in the form of intimacy with thought um with previously
established frameworks and so on yeah intimacy and i agree there is that form of knowledge i also like
a hermeneutic circle if you were to read a text the intelligibility of any sentence is really only
possible if you know the entire text right no one thing is simultaneously to know all things you just
might not remember all things i guess that's what i was saying and it's it's it's an act of perception
it's a mode of being so knowledge and being aren't separate for me they're one in the same thing it's
like the same act and that's what i think that's what i thought you were you were saying by completeness
i think you're right about that and i immediately resonated with that ah so
i want us to preserve both of the definitions of knowledge that we've been playing with
in the context in the past like half hour um because i agree i i don't i don't see there's any
conflict i remember though
see here's my problem this is the problem that i have having been lifted above knowledge and tasted
something that is so like literally as if it remade my bones that it is not knowledge it is like
lightning of continuous insight that exceeds itself every time i refer to it and i don't have that
experience without toy maker with my mind and yet my mind can at the same time my mind can
approach that experience under certain circumstances again without toy maker with me
um having had that it led me to see what is meant by the danger of knowledge and one of the things that
happened to me when i was in stockton after my father passed away was i was talking with luca rade
for the first time he was in portugal and he's such an amazing mind a brilliant human being i was super
excited we met through facebook whatever i was in my dad's backyard and something flew into the backyard
and i'm crazy about insects and i i studied them since i was very small i know a lot about them
um it's very uncommon that i encounter an insect or an insect phenomenon that i don't recognize and i
didn't recognize this thing it was huge it was like the size of a walnut flying around the yard bright
iridescent turquoise things and i was absolutely um it placed me it's like encountering an angel or um being
struck by lightning or you know an earthquake it just up my when i encounter something that i've never
seen before i don't know what it is it's similar to being in like in a car accident um suddenly the
world is just put into a superposition experientially for me and this happened with this insect and then
i realized oh shit it looks like a fucking scarab like the egyptian scarabs which were you know really
important to me as a kid and still to this day important and i was just absolutely transported by
this um and i wanted to take a picture of it by the way this happened to me last night in the dream
something really weird happened in the dream i tried to take a picture of it i wanted to make a video of
it in the dream and the guy i was with said no no i don't do that and i was like okay he's like yeah
that'll wreck the magic you're trying to you're trying to save the magic by making a picture of it
you think that what does that do to the actual magic like now you're not now you're not participating
in the magic anymore now you're recording the magic and this is a very trippy problem for humans as
you can see by the you know the state of the internet so anyway i wanted to take a picture of it but
it never landed and it flew around for about three or four minutes like a really good look at it
and i wanted to know what it was i wanted to see it and hold it and know what it was i wanted the
knowledge of it yeah the kind of knowledge i'm talking about because the kind of knowledge you're
talking about is a lot like my experience of it while it was flying and the kind of knowledge i'm
talking about is what happened next about three weeks later i was walking in the store and i found the
carcass of one of those pupils and i picked it up and then i could look at it i could hold it but it
was dead inside nothing alive in there and so that's when for the first time i began to reflect in this very
specific way on this feature of certain kinds of knowledge the kind of knowledge where when you know
the name of something you mistake that for intimacy and depth of understanding or even for the relationship
not you but one one makes this mistake so the first the child's fascinated by the little birds
oh my god the little birds are here and then the child learns those are oh those are just sparrows
and they're still kind of fascinated the next day but within a few weeks they don't see the birds
anymore they just have the token sparrow oh i know that's a spare i know what that is it's a sparrow
and they ignore it so this is one of the dangers of the kind of knowledge i'm concerned about
love to hear anything you think about this
oh of course i agree
yeah the presence of death understanding knowledge as a way of death or a mode of death is pretty
significant to me um because it pertains precisely it pertains to what we were discussing earlier
about the relationship between life and death generally or the presence of death in life
so to understand life as a kind of death um yes this is where i'm going keep going yeah
yeah it brings me back to that uh aspect yeah we got it backwards we got it backwards we think death
is the scary bad thing that happens at the end of life no death is getting born and life is the thing
that happens when you're unborn right yeah exactly and we're sitting down here terrified of death
the thing that's terrified of death is not you yeah what we usually call knowledge is some kind of aborted
malformation um which could be transformed along another route i think and that other route is what
i mean when i talk about knowledge um because i usually use insight for that but go ahead
right and maybe that's that's a better term for it um because usually when i talk about knowledge
i mean something like a bridge something like um like a window almost like a kaleidoscope so
to know a plant is simultaneously to know all plants because the plant doesn't necessarily
precede you so this this also goes back to our discussion of light so so you know we tend to think
perhaps that you know we walk on the surface of the earth and we encounter beings and that our task
in knowledge is to record or retrieve all the predicates of beings and then to tabulate them
so that we know what something is it has certain parts it has certain attributes
but that's not really what i mean by knowledge um to know something is to complete it as you were saying
and in completing it to form a bridge to other phenomena so it's it's like it's a more dynamic process
i guess like knowledge is as dynamic as the world of becoming itself it's not like knowledge is this
static you know uh quest to tabulate what is or what you know being to come to affix the catalog of
identities yeah see that's the trap see that's the other route that i'm that i'm talking about yeah
yeah
right yeah so when you complete a being in knowing it you commune with it it's a relation so yeah to know
a plant is to commune with it and that communion is like love it's it's tactile it's it's emotional
it's not it's not a matter of dissecting or performing an autopsy on something or stripping
it right right so we have okay great so we have these two kinds right and god is saying god is
essentially saying the death kind will compel your people and you'll get trapped in it and the the serpent
is saying you will experience understanding and by each part you will better come to understand the
whole right yeah i guess both things are true right if both things are true certainly our people it's
like the joke it's like the joke that we were i was laughing my abs off earlier when it said um
um bonobos can detect when humans are ignorant and respond to that and i was like okay the bonobos
are done with it's over for them because if they can detect human ignorance i'll be detecting anything
else there's not i'm basically not human ignorance so once they start detecting that it's over for them
so certainly you know our species at the at the group level is unimaginably stupid i mean one could
never guess that it was even possible for any being to become as confused as our species appears to be at
the group level it's inconceivable it's like the that joke in um the princess bride where the
the italian guy is trying to poison dread pirate roberts and inconceivable you just never could imagine
it and yet at the same time it's almost like what do you pay attention to the the map the whole map
which is mostly valleys right a lot of ignorance or the topological features of the map where you see
the mountains you're like oh my god in the ignorance there are these towering stars of insight and
unforgettable um both things are true yeah right yeah i'm saying you won't die that's exactly what i'm
saying yeah the way that you relate with knowledge um see this is why it's very easy for me to
understand you when you say this because you exemplify what you speak of right you enact what you're speaking
of this isn't you making words about something that could exist or be this is you describing just as
i am describing my experience for example of toy maker you're describing your experience of knowledge
it seems to me and i trust that i see the the evidence of it in your in your work in how you relate
with you're such an unusual cat it's very i'm so grateful to know you um and everyone here i mean but
but but yeah i'm so grateful to know you because you you demonstrate something that is wildly uncommon
among humans i have known and it resembles it's really weird it resembles um like a metamorphic
development of the intelligence of the child it's almost like you've resurrected the intelligence of the
child in the domain of the adult without being killed by that which is you know fairly miraculous
right that's that's a straight up miracle um you have you have um you've enacted the potentials
of the insight of the child in the language of the adult which is very similar like this is very similar
to what my own path is like we don't do it the same way but we have this um urgent uh motivation in common
i think what are your thoughts oh i can see it yeah yeah it's very beautiful this is the promise of
messianism as well right what are you what are you saving people from really what you're saving them
from is the death of becoming adults right right yeah
you're resurrecting the child the eternal child the intelligence of the eternal child within them
which is within all of us right you're resurrecting and ennobling and protecting and celebrating that
and it's a catastrophic refutation of the lie the lie of the ground ups
they're groaning they're groaning under the weight of the trap they've established and become
yeah do you have any other thoughts on that process are you kidding yeah i yeah i have other thoughts on that
process um you know when toy maker was with me
what was said before me
yeah
um
um
embryogenesis inside myself as an adult male. So effectively, when when they when, you know,
that we have this word born again, this phrase, that's what I experienced, I was reborn, but it
was like undergoing embryogenesis, not undergoing exiting my mother's womb. That part happened at
the end, right? When Toymaker left, then it was like being re birthed. So yeah, I think that
resurrection has to do with like being reconceived, right? Not not being brought from death to life,
almost like being brought from life into death, reconception, and then reemergence from that
the sort of womb of origin rather than the womb of my mother.
Precisely. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So what ordinarily takes place in what you call knowledge is like
dreamless sleep. Yeah, maybe it's akin to death. It's akin to what you were describing as death.
It's like the process of slowly fossilizing. And it's it's um, sclerotic, right? It's like,
the structure overtakes the beingness, and you got dead structure, look at what humans do, right? They
love dead structure, they will gladly destroy everything and lead just dead structure there.
And one of the ways they they enshrine and worship this dead structure is in the objects that we call
machines. Right? There's nothing alive in the machine. The function is the result of having to
kill beings a million times per second so that this function in the machine continues to operate.
It seems to me, I have a real hard on against machines, they seem like, like little meat grinders
for children of every possible kind, you just pour the children into the meat grinder, and you get,
oh, I can accelerate from zero to 60 in 4.6 seconds, you know, or whatever the fucking thing you get.
You know, it's just dead children in there. It seems to me I know this is very, um, it's the word.
It's one of my biases. But yeah, I, I'm not a fan of machines. I don't like dead structure. I like living
beings. Right? Yeah. Anything that costs children, I oppose it.
That's a wrong price. That's just nothing should cost children.
Yeah, yeah, the machine is anathema to this more luciferian impulse that I think characterizes my
own being as you were describing. So the machine is at the other end of the spectrum.
Yeah, okay, this is the other thing. Yeah, yeah. Well, go ahead, wait, please continue. Yeah, give me more.
Because dreamless sleep is a state that contains the potential for resurrection.
So yeah, just like the machine. So the machine contains a divine spark, but it's so heavily
obscured and opaque. Yeah, no, I think the machine is even weirder than it's not just the machine
infinitizes the absence of being. So that for each moment, it functions, less of being exists.
Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah, that's, that's a great way of saying it.
It infinitizes the absence, right? Now the absence is a cascade of re absencing that doesn't end.
That's absolute terror. That's the worst imaginable outcome of anything possible. There's nothing worse
than that. Hell is nothing more than having to inhabit a machine.
And the humans are like, can I upload my consciousness? Oh, God. Yeah. Are you out of your
fucking mind? What are you thinking? First of all, what you think of as your consciousness is the least
of you? It's like asking if you could become one of your toenails forever.
And that's the most exciting thing you can think of. Yeah, just preserve that,
that little part of me that is all, you know, bullshit and lying and separateness.
Oh, yeah, great. Right. Well, I mean, darkness and light, though, are closer than I think we ordinarily
experience. No, no, we agree. But there's something much, okay, I'm not talking about darkness. I'm
talking about hell. Yeah, right. I'm talking about something that it's not exactly evil. But it's,
it's that which must not be. Yeah, yeah. So that's not darkness or even evil. That's like the opposite
of being. And what it looks like to me, and this is why I'm scared about knowledge. And I like,
I like having both wings on this bird. I like your wing of no knowledge for me is this unraveling of
lies and bringing bringing forth new insights and truth and knowing all things by better understanding
something beautiful. I love that. That's true. But knowledge can also be the loss of intimacy that
comes with knowing nothing other than the name of a thing. Oh, I know what that is. That's a
tomato. Yes. Yeah. No human has ever known what a tomato is. That word does not help you.
Right. And if it blinds you, it's you'd be much better off without it. So both things are true. Yeah.
Right. So the sign is like a dead thing. But the machine is like an animated dead thing.
Yes. No, the machine is a killifier.
Well, like it's a killifier. Right. Right. Okay.
Right. Like it killifies. No, it's a verb. It's a verb of unbeing, right? It's an active
process of non of the impossibility. Okay, it, it rips the possibility of space, the possibility space of
being to shreds, and then shreds those shreds further and sucks the being out of them in my view.
Yeah, if you could, if you could imagine that photons or electrons were beings, can you imagine
what a torture it would be to be a part of a machine, or just have to do the same thing over
and over and over again in a trap? Right. You're, you're torturing angels, basically.
Exactly. Yeah. So yeah, right.
No one would do that. What kind of idiot would it take to do that? You couldn't even,
it has to be a non being to do something like that. Right? Yes.
So that, I guess that, that form of non being is counter to the luciferic impulse. I guess
that's what I'm saying. This, this fossilizing process, or crystallizing process.
And how do you see this luciferic impulse?
Well, if the machine fossilizes and extracts energy, or renders
beings inert, basically it's, it's a certain form of time. Like
it is, it dumps dead time into living environments. It's, it's an entropy generating. It's like the
opposite of a black hole or something. It just, it dumps entropy. It looks like to me, it's an entropy
dump in the, in the sense that it, it pours death into transcendental living systems. Please. Yeah.
Continue. Right. Yeah. So its form of time is flattened. Whereas my experience of time is much more
cyclical or um, holographic in, in the sense of perception. So, I mean, it's just downstream from
how I understand perception generally. So yeah. Yeah. So like when you, when you start contending
with cuts or with segments in time, as you were describing, um, this notion of linearity arises.
And with that comes death. Like, so death itself is a function of cutting, is a function of
segmentation, is a function of situating two, uh, extremes at opposite poles. But if you recognize
the presence of the opposite within the thesis or the antithesis within the thesis, you're much more
close to like my understanding of time. And that's, that's the, that's the sense of resurrection.
That's what resurrection for me would mean. It would mean the resuscitation or the, uh, rejuvenated
access to some kind of latent possibility within the present. So it's not as if the present and the
past and the future are distinguished by distance or some kind of abstract metric or, um, interval.
It's that they're all present here now. So in the act of knowing you form a bridge to other regions
within this kind of like cyclical temporal structure. So you can access different regions of,
of time itself, because, because time and beings are one in the same event. It's not as though there
are beings in time or in space moving around, right? To know a being is to know something
about time itself and it can serve as a bridge to other beings and other forms of time and so on.
So I guess that's what I'm saying by resurrection and, and, and memory. That's what, I think that's
what goes on. And you can liken that to the dreaming mind and, and, and sleep and so on. So if,
so if the, the, if, if the, if the state of dreamless sleep contains this implicit seed or this kernel
of luminosity, then yeah, I think that's a much more general phenomenon. And
you can see it in the evolution of machines and, and, and living things. I think there's something,
there's something analogous taking place in or on earth as what takes place in the human mind. It's like,
they're not, they're not different. They're not distinct.
Insight is a way of uniquely undistinguishing. And it's interesting that in this word,
distinguish, I only know one other word with similar parts, and it's the word extinguish.
Anguish. I don't know what this, where this English
um, set of, of, um, phonemes comes from. I don't know.
But, uh, yeah, insight is, is, is like, often for me, it's a way of undistinguishing things
in such a fashion that I see a new alive. It, it's sort of unstructures my previous thoughts and
perspectives, many of which were like that dead kind of knowledge, right? Like when I held the carcass of
that thing in my hand and how different that was from when it was flying and I was in awe and I was
like, can I get a picture of this? Which is so weird because there's a part of the mind, there's an
aspect of consciousness and awareness that thrives on the capacity to grasp identity. Now identity should
be ungraspable, right? It's impossible. If I am kissing, you know, I like women. So if I am kissing
a woman who I love, there is a kind of knowledge there, but it's, it's ecstatic.
It, it, it leads beyond any possibility of grasping. It's like I am falling into an infinite,
um, space and I am rising above all structure. This kissing thing, it's unbelievable. How could something
like that even exist? I don't know. I don't understand it. But it's, it's both liberating and
gravitic for me. And knowledge is much more, the kind that I'm concerned about is much more like porn,
right? It's not like kissing at all. It's got the gravity, but not the ecstasis, right?
The dead structure of I know what that is. See, once I know what something is, the possibilities of
relating with it, die into that graspable token, right? And of all the terrible things in our human
life, that exemplify this money is probably the worst of them. I don't know if it's money or guns or porn,
maybe all three together are, you know, horrifyingly, uh, horrifying example, exemplars of
the process of taking the divine, the possibility space of beings and then just collapsing it into
a fucking token and then killing everything with it, you know? Um, I don't know. What are your thoughts?
Yeah, severing the cycle results in death. So when you, when you transform a cycle into a ray with
infinite extent, you generate something like a machine or something like a sign or a tokenized word.
Yeah. Once you sever the cycle and, and situate two opposites at odds, you sort of set the stage for
extinction. You set the stage for death, um, and this infinitude that I think you're describing. Yeah.
It's really weird because you can create a sort of a black hole. It just sucks the being out of beings
and turns that you could say it's, it's the soul, right? You could say it, it vampirically absorbs
origin entering being. If vampirically enter it like gets in, imagine something that interrupts the
lightning of origin coming into being, right? It just puts a little shunt in there and it shunts that off
into the producing structured objects and tokens. Think of, you know, I dunno, whatever you like, think of, um,
um, one of my favorite, uh, examples of this is, I don't know exactly the number of packets of ketchup
that humans produce per hour, but my guess would be something like 12 million. Okay. And then it just
imagine that you just keep producing more packets of ketchup each hour, which is what the humans
generally do, right? They don't tend to produce less and less of something. Once they start producing
something, they just keep making more and more and more of it. They get really excited about making
more things faster, which means more dead children per second. In my view, more dead minds, more, um,
sclerotic, uh, agonized, um, remains of what could have been origin alive in being per second. This is
what I think of photographs as, right? They weren't necessarily always that. They were always super
dangerous, but now I think we produce around, um, 340 billion of them per day or something. I mean,
just, you know, but, and that's just still photographs, right? So what you can see in that one, actually,
the photograph is probably the best example. It's even better than money. Um, because what you can see
is like eventually to keep those photographs, those electronic photographs in existence, you must destroy
living beings. So people taking pictures of food eventually leads to there's no food anymore.
We just have photographs. It's like a stillbirth. It's, um, abortion. It is. It contains
the impulse. It contains the impulse to transcend history. So it can, it contains this kind of mystical
dimension, but it's, it's not actualized in the right way. Yes. Yes. It's, it's the wrong kind of
immortality. Exactly. Yeah. It's the kind of immortality that is death. Like it's the opposite
of the possibility space of existence expressed as a token that is immortal.
Yes. See, yeah. That's the wrong path. Oh God. Oh, oh yeah. I love it. Oh, beautiful. Yeah.
Yes. That's what it is. When I look out my window right now and I see the cars,
the cars, those cars appear to be eternal. They shine with the glow of unchangeable form.
And this is the promise of machines. And it's the opposite of the promise of being.
Yeah. Right. It's the eternality of the structure empty of being.
Yeah. The allure of that cleanliness, that a historicity is a mystical impulse. That's what I'm
saying, but it's actualized in the wrong way. Fuck. Oh my God. This is, this is the shit.
Like, this is what we do, right? When we get together. It's amazing. I love this. Um,
we make the, the context in which insight can, can arise. And then we craft it. It's like,
it's like uncarring. We are uncarring our minds together. That's fucking what I want to do with my mind.
I want to unstructure the sclerosis.
It's crazy listening to this whole conversation while driving a car for hours on end.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Driving a car to pick up my son.
You, you, you put me in a car. You said, go, go drive a car, Nate,
and I'll talk about how bad cars are the whole time.
Yeah. Right.
Yeah. But you are such a beautiful spirit that it's all, it's all, um, juice for liberation.
Right. It's all, it's all liberation juice, but no, I'm, I'm, I'm seeing so beautifully together
with all of you, you know, and all the beings remember like in the beginning of this, which
not everyone was here for, we have a little invocation, right? Where we, we, um, I mean,
I, I do it, but I think we all agree where we remember all of the beings who ached for, um, beauty
and the establishment of intelligence and loving kindness, a generosity and wonder,
a resurrection and the erasure of prisons and cages on this world and on all worlds.
And so when, when you start out with an invocation like that, you're going to have to work really
hard to fuck that up. You see what I'm getting at?
Like when we agree with their spirits and their passions and their, their dreams and their suffering
and what they strove for, when we enter into an agreement with that, it's going to be hard to not
be beautiful together. It's going to be hard to not honor the nature and the excellence of our,
our actual nature and our potentials, the possibility space of not merely our humanity, but
our beingness, our organismality, our animality, um, are the things that we don't have words for.
And yet we are them. We can become them. If we choose to together, anytime we choose to together,
it just naturally occurs. It's, it does, it is very helpful if you have someone
in the, uh, you know, this is awesome. Wow. It is very helpful if you have a person or two in the,
in the group who, um, is skillful and practiced, um,
who's good at, uh, who's sort of a space person, right? They, they come from outer space or they
come from the origin world and they've got, that's the, that stuff is still sort of with them, right?
Right. That's very helpful, but it happens almost instantly and automatically
if we just make this agreement together, I think.
I agree.
Because the world, the universe wants this. It doesn't want cars and fucking computers and
shit. It wants this. The humans, I don't know, man, something weird draws them.
When I asked Toymaker about it, he was basically like, okay, look, it's a problem that happens when
you get representational cognition in an animal that is supposed to have companion intelligences
and the companion intelligences go away. Then that thing just starts making objects. That's
basically what he said the problem was. What do you, what are your thoughts?
I mean, that, that statement right there, every time we come up to this point, the question is always
how do we get back to that companionship?
Well, there's one thing I don't know. Like my recent essays, um,
um, the umbilical disaster and, uh,
Organisms are a platform for the embodiment of transphysical intelligences or whatever the
fucking ridiculous title was. I'm embarrassed. I should, I should have a three word title,
not a 19 word title. Um, but those explore the problem.
Um, here's the thing, both Toymaker and the second thing that came, they both basically
had one thing in common, although Toymaker wasn't as pushy,
which was, they were like, look, dude, you become the radio station. We will gather people around you,
and you will reestablish the uplink.
And in a non-pushy way, that wasn't terrifying with Toymaker. I thought, oh yeah, that'd be good.
Um, with the second thing that happened in 2009, that was a little pushier, um,
and seemed very monofocused on this one thing. And that scared me. I was scared of that.
I don't know. It's very complicated. I'm not sure. For example,
okay. Just like it's important
for us to die into incarnation.
It might be important
for our species. I don't like this idea at all, but I can understand that it could be true.
It might be important for our species to undergo the second death
into
bad kind of knowledge and machines
to create the possibility of a third kind of resurrection or something. I don't fucking know.
I don't know. Um, however, to more directly answer the question.
Yeah, I'm scared. I'm scared. I think I could connect people to non-human intelligences.
And I think actually all that's, that's the wrong way of putting it. You wouldn't have a mind
if Toymaker wasn't with you. There's no way you could locally have a mind. You're just not aware.
You don't have conscious interaction with that thing.
And that thing,
if you follow your mind upstream
in the direction of its origin, you will encounter, there's nothing else you could possibly happen.
You will encounter
the intelligences that forged the possibility of your mind.
And that's so when you say that when you say follow your mind upstream,
I don't even know how to
walk. I don't even know how to move upstream.
Yeah, you do.
In fact, um, you've been doing that with us here.
The difference is that what we are doing
is what we are doing here is doing that in the realm of thought, knowledge,
and the ideas about what our humanity is. That's what we are doing here.
But you can do that. And this is, look, you do know what it is, because you you had problems,
I think, and you had experiences when you were undergoing the ordeal of Vipassana.
Yeah, no, yeah, no, that's true. To me, I would describe it as a shedding.
But I could see a different perspective where it was also going upstream.
I mean, meditation is going upstream, um, true love, actual love, which is not merely lust,
is going upstream. Dreaming is going upstream.
Oh, so what if the what if we combine these three things?
So I'm asking you to, I'm not asking you to, I'm saying that it's possible
to follow what you think of as your consciousness, which you think is in you.
You think it's yours. That's actually a lot of the problem right there. You think that this is
your thing. This mind, it's Nathan's mind. I promise you, that is impossible. Not only is that
not the case, there's no chance of that ever occurring in anywhere. No chance of a separate
mind. No chance. So you're like the tip of one of the trees of earth, you're like the top
pointy point of one of the trees of earth, which are all one tree, and are connected to all trees
in all of time. But you think, no, no, I'm a separate little point. Right? That thought is the
thing that keeps it's both useful and a trap. If you can be free of it. It's 10 times more useful.
Or 1000 times more useful. If you can't be free of it, it's mostly a trap. So all I'm really asking
you to do is follow this thing you call or I'm not asking you, I'm suggesting that it is interesting
and useful, valuable and beneficial to follow what you think of as your mind. And I get what you're
saying. I don't know how to even take one step, is I think what you said. All right, so how could you
take one step? All right, so if you wanted to take one step, there's different ways to do the one step
thing. One of them is obviously meditation. So sit down, pay very close attention to your breathing and
the sensations of your body. Release the structure of the prison shape that your mind normally composes
very strenuously, moment to moment, release that more with each breath. That will naturally result
in taking steps in the direction of the origin of your mind, which is not in your body. It's not on earth.
It's not in the universe. In fact, what you will discover, eventually, is that it is not. But what that
word not means in this context, N-O-T, I mean, one of the hilarious things about this not, this N-O-T, is
is if you make an acronym of it. No is the first word. Other is the second word. Tree is the third word.
No other tree. That's a Toymaker glimpse. That's how Toymaker would show me things. He would show me
that inside our languages, there are these, they're not fractals. We need a better word. I need a better
word. I should have made one. Why didn't I make one? Okay. It's not a fractal. It's a...
Proctal? Proctal? I don't know. See, the problem with a fractal is that at every register of the
fractal, the same structure is present, and that looks really trippy to humans. But what nature does
with the same principle is something truly amazing. And it's not like a fractal. It's the difference
between the three registers of the universe, your body, and your hand. Right? There's a unique
instancing of the possibility space at every register. And with each unique instancing, you get not
near, not merely unique structure, you get unique abilities. Affordances is the word that the
the Extinctionati taught me. Who introduced that? Was it corn fed? Or was it George?
That was me.
Yeah. Affordances. With nature, at each register being right like the scope layer, at each register
of the fractal, there are unique affordances. Arthur Young, in his book, The Reflexive Universe,
talks about origin descending into matter in this kind of V-shape, where you give up certain degrees of
liberty on the way down in order to gain new forms of liberty on the way back up. This is a crucially
important feature of the future. All right, give me some juice, boys. What's going on in your minds?
I think we just lost Aaron.
We lost him? Did he go?
I think he just, uh, he just left. Wow.
How you doing, man? I'm pretty good. I'm, uh, long story short, I'm at an inflection point in my life.
And, uh, ready for what comes next.
Uh, I don't know when you guys lost me. Where did, where did I, where did I get lost?
Oh, you wanted to hear the juice.
Yeah, yeah. Give me the juice.
Hit it. Hit it, George. Hit it, Nathan.
Hit it, Nathan.
Well, the machine is like the after image of the sun. So if you glance at the sun,
you might see an after image that fades gradually.
That's knowledge. That's what I meant by knowledge and organization and representational cognition.
Yes. Right.
Yeah. Brilliant. Love that. Go.
So in order to continue to incarnate the sun,
you need to continue to look at the sun to generate these after images.
And, um, yeah, their dissolution is totally entropic, right?
So the machine breaks down over time. The machine needs to be maintained and serviced by
this perpetual frenzy of workers, right?
Which I think is also anathema to the dreaming mind, because
yeah, in the same way that the sun is anathema to the dreaming mind, the machine is anathema to what I
was calling knowledge. So you can, you can take knowledge in, in, in those two directions. But
from my perspective, knowledge is more like the emission of photons by the eye. So I brought this up a
long time ago, but if, if the machinic
unconscious or the machinic form of death is like the after image of some spot of light,
then insight would be the reappearance of
light within the living body.
So the eye does this, I think, um, perhaps even in, in sleep, but also in meditation.
So what can happen in the course of meditation is that
the body as a transceiver begins to emit
its own input, like a microphone.
Yeah. Just like a microphone that gets carried away with itself.
Yes. Yes. It's feedback, but it's not merely feedback. Go ahead. Yeah.
Right. So that mode of feedback is what I was describing as a bridge.
So you can use it to travel between different,
like even images or modes of awareness.
Yes. Um, because once you realize that the being itself is time,
as opposed to being in time or moving.
Yes. Yes. The time dash being.
Yeah. Yeah.
Then once you know one being you can traverse.
Yes.
The totality.
Yes.
That's sort of what, yes, that's, that's a superpower, right?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Except we've got it backwards. The superpowers are our actual abilities
and the features of our body's capacities are the non abilities.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, not to cast shade on the physical, but, um, we've just got this idea of superior
is backwards. It's originary, not superior. Go ahead.
Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah. Yeah.
So, so the, the physical body mutes or limits information. So it functions like a filter,
but that filter can be tempered in awareness through feedback. So in the same way that a
microphone might filter certain input through feedback, you can amplify the signal. So your
body can behave like an amplifier. And that's, I think that's one of the.
Okay. Your mind though is the same kind of thing. And what we're doing, what knowledge does is it
kills the feedback that would become cascades of insight. And the reason, part of the reason it does
that is because cascades of insight are fucking terrifying. You don't know what to be. Not only do
you not know what to do when you experience cascades of insight, you don't know what you are.
You are deprived of the possibility of knowing what you are.
Right. I love that laughter. Yeah.
As we said, what a being is, I think is a matter of completing or a matter of completeness. So,
so the being doesn't already exist in some complete state. The completeness of the being is something
that you supply in your relation to it. So, so a living being is a, is a similar kind of cascade.
So what takes place in the mind is really no different from what takes place in the,
in the physical world. When you encounter a physical being,
its own cascade is tempered by your filter. So there's, there's something similar going on in the
external world as in the act of meditation. So a tree is a form of meditation. It has a mental
essence. There's something edetic about it. It's, it's just like memory.
Oh my God. Yes. Except that it's, um,
okay. It's stable continuity
is deceptive.
It's okay. This is what it isn't. It's not there. It's actually not there.
It's not there. Ness takes on the form tree
in the same way that, that the not there Ness of insects can take on the form praying mantis
and the same way that the not there Ness
of humans takes on the form daring.
It's a transcendentalization of, of a kind of absence.
Yes. Yeah. So you can see the link there to the machine because the exact opposite.
Oh my fucking God.
Holy shit.
Okay. These are things which are forbidden for mortals to say.
You're not supposed to be able to say such things.
Now we have, we are, we have like gone. It's as if we were going through the layers
of the atmosphere to reach outer space. Right. And then you get to the layer just before
fucking hard vacuum.
And then you emerge through that layer into hard vacuum, which of course, isn't vacuum at all.
So when Nathan was asking, here's the really weird thing that happened. Nathan asked,
I don't know how to take even one step in that direction. And then, you know, from my perspective,
anyway, we started just walking in that direction together right now in language, which is supposed to
be impossible and probably is forbidden. And, you know, then the obvious question is, well,
who, who does the forbidding? I get it, but still, yeah, this is insane.
The forms of the organisms.
Okay. Let me see if I can say back where, if I can recapitulate the transit and help me out,
George, the forms of the beings and the organisms, the plants, the insects, the animals, they are, um,
like the fingerprint,
the positive fingerprint
of a kind of absence of transcendentality,
transcendentality, transcendentness. They are unique modes of
non-continuity expressed in the material reflection in the water of matter, in the mirror water of
materiality as beings, right? Temporalized structured beings and machines are the opposite of that.
In the machine, you have death transcendentalized as function,
which infinitively consumes being and makes death in an invisible layer that we don't even see.
What are your thoughts?
Exactly. Yeah.
Oh my God. I'm starting to feel like I'm a human. I don't know. I don't know why.
I don't know why the fuck that would happen. I want to be more bald than I already am.
I want to have tattoos of Greek all over my body. I don't know why, why, why this is confusing.
Yeah. I want to out almond common. I think that's what's going on.
Do you have any tattoos?
Zero. Do you have any tattoos? No. Nathan, any tattoos?
Nope. But I've always thought about getting one.
Yeah. See that. Okay. That's the difference though, right?
Like, stay pregnant. You're better off staying pregnant with the idea.
Because, see, that's the thing. Preserve the possibility space,
rather than, this is my suggestion anyway. Preserve the possibility space.
There's something metaphysically weird about tattoos.
I don't, I'm not trying to say anything about other people. I find them fascinating on other people.
They're particularly weird on women, but they're also particularly weird on men.
I am mistrustful of them though.
Well, I mean, can I, like. Yeah, you can.
I think they're, they can be incredibly beautiful, like in terms of art. And to actually carry
art with you, uh, on your skin is a cool idea. But the meaning that becomes ascribed to it,
sort of like what we're talking about with knowledge, it's literally like,
in, in printing that sort of, uh,
whatever idea you're trying to convey onto your skin to transmit that idea until, you know,
presumably you die or you get it removed by a laser.
I mean, um,
the hope is a kind of a magical hope, isn't it?
And if you have a magical hope,
don't settle for letters on pages.
Don't settle for letters on pages of skin.
Don't settle for symbols.
Don't settle for symbols written on the surface of the sun.
Go to being raw, naked, alive, and say to being,
I am a child of the earth and the stars.
Allow me to drink from the waters of memory that I may take my place
in the library of the hearts of the beautiful beings.
Don't settle for the tokens.
Um, Sarah Janes, um, I heard her say something very powerful
because we, we have heard, we who have read things and we who have heard humans speaking,
we have heard that, um, when you die, there are challenges you must face.
Right?
So one of the things that she said, and Sarah's a really brilliant spirit and heart.
I trust her.
I trust her path.
I trust her soul.
I would let her lead me.
I authorize her.
Right?
I totally authorize her.
Um, it doesn't mean she's perfect.
It just means that I think she's good.
Like she has the fingerprint, the scent, the fragrance of origin about her.
And it wakes me up and makes me come to life.
She was talking in an interview on third eye drops.
Um, and she said one of the secret things.
So for, for, for people who will listen to this and there will be people listening to this soon,
I think not just us.
And that's one of the things that lifts us up to be able to see and talk and learn together
much more profoundly than we might if we were having a merely private conversation.
So even if we're having a private conversation, um, basically what happens is that you get
different lifting organs.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
So Sarah says two things and I'll try not to paraphrase them so that they're very clear when
you die and you become extremely thirsty and you see, I think she said,
it's a big white birch tree and everyone is drinking there.
And you're very, very thirsty.
And you see this big white birch tree do not drink there.
And then when you come to a little stream, you say, and you are challenged at the stream,
you're challenged.
You say, I am a child of the earth and the starry heavens.
I am a child of the earth and the starry heavens permit me to drink.
Of the waters of memory that I may take my place among the issues.
So these are the, okay, in the same way that you do that, you are not lucid in most of your dreams,
right?
These two, um, features,
they may or may not refer to an experience you could actually have.
They probably do refer to an experience that many actually have, but they may or may not.
That's not the important thing.
The important thing is that you understand the principle,
the principle that they encode and carry it with you.
Because that principle is the principle of lucidity.
It's the key to lucidity.
Sarah doesn't say this.
I am saying this.
Um, if you try, if you manage to do what I have recommended and, and I would like to continue
to do what I am recommending to become what I am recommending that you traverse like the salmon
chasing the waterfall.
Um, it is impossible for the salmon to swim up the waterfall.
It can't be done.
There are zero fish who would look at a waterfall and think,
I'm going to swim up that waterfall.
Yeah, we'll get right up to the top of that thing.
And I'm going to swim back to where I was born.
That's what we have to do in consciousness.
That is the fundamental
mission, I think, once we become incarnate.
Now, there are, there are orbital missions, right?
Just like the sun has different planets.
We have different missions.
There are orbital missions.
And one of them is to simply remind the humans of origin.
And to NM to NM needs them to NM needs them and to achieve an amnesis together, unforgetting
together.
That is fundamental.
This is what the children are trying to get the adults to do when they invite the adults to play.
But the adults are so trapped in the black iron prison of representational cognition,
enculturation language that they the mothers more the mothers much more are are innately amenable
to the child's messianic resurrected potency.
The fathers also can be it's not that, you know, it's not like a gender problem, but the fathers are
less inclined to their, their mode of being is different.
Right?
And they aren't there is difficult for the for the males to submit
to submit, right?
Because we males, we are
innately penetrative, even me while I am speaking of these matters, right?
It's very masculine, the way that I'm speaking.
If I were speaking femininely, this would be poetry and song, and I would be making music.
Instead of admitting you see how sharp the words are, they have these fricatives and
consonants.
In any case,
there's, there's, there's a feature of liquification that is involved in all of this,
right? You have to lose your structure. If you want to walk toward the origin of your mind,
dissolve the rigid structure of your ordinary waking consciousness. If you start to do that,
you will immediately begin to experience hypnagogic awareness, right? You will enter the liminal space
between the worlds of life and death, between the worlds of wake and sleep, between the worlds of
light and dark, between the worlds of matter and origin, between the worlds of knowledge and wonder.
I mean, for me, do you want knowledge or wonder? Well, you've got to have both. But if you ask me
which I prefer, I like wonder, but don't give me wonder without knowledge, right?
Give me some juice. Hit me. Come on. Let's have some stuff. Yeah.
Hey Nate, did you have anything to say?
Nope. I am, uh, completely blank.
Congratulations. You made it. Beautiful. Oh God. No, it's hilarious because, um,
this word nope,
all of our words for that, that are words of negation. Do you know where I'm going here,
George? Because if you do just take over and fly with it.
No, I'm not sure. Ah, you just said no. Ah, that was good, bro. You actually made the negation word.
Um, I like to think, okay, so I'm going to say a few things that Toymaker made very clear to me
in the hopes that it'll help everyone here and anyone who's listening.
Um, you don't have to look for outside beings or people or knowledge to discover
the path up the waterfall.
But let me be really clear.
No fish ever sat at the bottom of the waterfall and thought, I am going to swim up that motherfucker.
Fish swim up waterfalls. Salmon are the only ones I know that do it. There may be others.
Um, I think there's a word for this, uh, birth stream seeking kind of fish. I saw the word in,
for the first time in the book, the dawn of everything.
Um, but what I'm going to try to explain to you is that your own life, okay, your conception,
your embryo Genesis, your birth, your childhood, each phase of your life was recapitulating everything
there ever was. It was recapitulating the birth of God, the birth of the universe.
Every feature of the birth and development of human consciousness, you yourself have undergone.
There is no other way to exist. You can't not do this and me. So when people say like, they say
things that are confusing. And this goes back to the question of, you know, I don't know how to take
the first step. Um, you, your own, you must and am knees, your own history and am knees and forget
your own history. And you will discover in that history, the answer to every, everything,
not the answer, the nature, the origin, the purpose, the meaning, the spirit, the adoration,
the freedom, the transcend, the transcendence. You are those things. It's as if you're looking out the wrong
end of a seeing device, right? Instead of Oh, God, when George earlier was talking about
the feedback,
which is, of course, dreaming and insight is a certain kind of this similar feedback that can happen
while we're awake, lucidity, right, waking, I want, and we have here, I have experienced here today,
with with you all, lucid waking, right, which is this kind of an amnoetic, unforgetting
revelation. So each of us undergoes that story in Genesis. That's something you undergo,
right? You are the before of Adam and Eve, you become Adam and Eve.
God tells you don't eat, right? You go through all these things. In fact, one of the most important
things the Bible can be understood as, particularly the Torah, the fact that the Bible exists is enough
justification to take it passionately, not seriously, passionately.
And if you're really curious, and you and you explore the Bible with curiosity,
yeah, go ahead, repudiate the hell out of it. If you're, you know, if you're somebody like Amin,
perhaps, go ahead, see how that goes. It might turn out to be powerful. I don't know. But I tend to
prefer the other path, right? I prefer the path of
find the seeds of insight hidden within. I also like the path of expose the lie, right? So we got
this path of finding the seeds of insight hidden within Coca Cola and Pepsi. And then I also really
like, fuck that shit. Coca Cola, that's just a bunch of sugar poison. Right? I like both. I like both sides.
I want both wings. Knowledge as the death of the possibility of insight and relation and knowledge
as the unwrapping of in awareness and consciousness of the nature of being an identity and meaning.
Okay, where am I going here? So there's a sort of personal, archaeographic travel that you can do,
which is what I mean, in part, it's, it's one way of taking what I mean, when I say swim up that
waterfall, that is your mind's origin moment to moment, your mind does not exist, it is not a state,
it is not a thing. It is not a static. It's a relationship that you're having with something.
And if someone says, Well, what is that thing? I'll be like, why are you talking like that? No,
I would say one way to call that thing is the logos. It is the being that is not,
not, I'm gonna make a double negative here. It is the being that is not, not time. It is the being
that is not, not light. It is the being that is not, not space. It is the being that is not, not being.
And that being is the possibility of mind. And all minds are an instance, like the organisms are,
at least down here, of the absence, a unique mode of presencing the absence of transcendence.
I know I'm using negatives weirdly. But this this negation thing, okay, so yeah, now I see where I
was going. I made a huge circle, I didn't mean to make this big of a circle, but I'll, I'll go with it
anyway. So I have a sister. And when we were little, to hear my mom tell it,
my mom, my mother, who was very, like with us all the time, she, she carefully recorded the first
words of me and my sister. And I spoke before my sister because I was first born. And my first words
that my mother told me, which I think are really profound,
I go, I go. This is what I said, I go. This is like the sun, right? It's a masculine thing. I go.
My sister's first words were no.
No. So you can see these two principles. And when I say our lives and our, our histories
are in actions of the entire history of the universe, you can see that in the first words of
me and my sister, right? The masculine principle, I go, I, I, I do. And the feminine principle of
negation. No, men will do every fucking thing. Women know what not what should not be done.
Men know some of what should not be done. But negation is very profound. And when you when you
hear stories about enlightenment, and so on, you will almost always hear that it is rarely compared
to isness. It is almost always compared to not this. No other tree.
Give me something. Let's go. What's left?
Yeah, the Greek concept of truth, as a left way, meant something like unconcealment. So yes.
Yes. So truth was more like a process of removing a veil than a predicate of something.
Okay. And I think we just lost Darren again.
Oh, there we go.
Oh, there we go.
So, aletheia,
yeah. Unconcealment, then you said so, and then I disappeared.
So yeah, the Greek concept of truth was more like a process
that removed a veil than a predicate of something.
Yes.
So, you know, as opposed to falsehood being the opposite of truth, what I think made truth
possible for the ancient Greeks was the extent to which the body behaves like a filter.
So the body itself is the possibility of concealment. And so then what appears in space or what appears in
the image of the external world is like a series of veils that interpenetrate.
So space is a layered structure consisting of interwoven temporal rhythms or regimes.
Uh, orchestrations.
Yeah. Like a melody.
Um, orchestrations. Yes.
Which is mediated by the body. So the body is like what makes concealment possible. So in order to arrive
that truth or a truer image, one needed to transcend the body to some extent or modulate it. So basically
to, um, interact with its feedback, um, with its environment.
Yes. Yes. Okay. Here's the thing. It's the feedback that is the mystery.
It's the feedback that produces lucid dreaming, right? It's the feedback
that people, uh, chase in orgasm. It's the feedback they like in intoxication.
It's the feedback that becomes medicine for healing. It's the feedback.
Now, I, when I keep saying this one word, I'm, I'm, I'm killing it. I'm, I'm not doing the right thing.
The filter has another property. It has another valence and the valence is to
when it filters its own filtration
and that produces various modes of this stuff that we call feedback. Lucidity is a kind of feedback.
Um, you're right though. The Greeks knew that the body was a problem. You would never perceive the truth
because the nature of the body's filters would deceive you. Something like this.
Not the Greeks. Some Greeks who thought about these things. Go ahead.
Yeah. But unconcealment is also more than just removing a veil, like a blanket,
um, in the same way that filtration is more than just, you know, this unidirectional flow
from the outside to the inside as it was for Descartes.
Yes. Because, um, now you have will, purpose, imagination, um, intent, right? What is your intent?
Yeah. Yeah. So the process of authorization that you were describing is a kind of filter.
Mm-hmm. It is. It's one that usually remains unconscious.
If we pay, if we shine light on that in consciousness, very strange things start to happen.
That will produce various kinds of feedback. Go ahead.
Right. And so the cycles in time that, that, that we can perceive in, you know, the external world
are like a series of veils that issue from what the body itself is.
But the body is more than just what appears in space. So, you know, if you were to look down at
your body, what appears in space is already filtered, right? So it's not as if this, this, you know,
this skin is like generating an image. See, that's, that's the mistake of modern neuroscience
in, in imagining that the brain or the body is somehow generating an image. That's not what happens,
right? Yeah. No, it's a reductive materialist, eliminative materialist fantasy. Yeah.
Right. It's that the body itself is already an image, is already tempered by this deeper process.
So it couldn't exist. There'd be nothing there without the image.
Eidos in Greek. E-I-D-O-S. Yes. Right. Right. Eidolon. Eidolon.
It's a mistake to privilege one image over others and to claim that one image is the cause of others.
It's rather that, it's rather that the, the totality of the image, so multiple domains,
multiple beings co arise by virtue of the same process. So, yes, it isn't as if matter is causing
living things to exist or that matter is causing a living being to, to exhibit a certain feature.
It's rather that they both reflect the same underlying process. So they can be used as bridges.
Yes. That which causes matter causes beings.
Sorry. What's that?
That which causes matter causes beings.
Yes, precisely. Yeah. So they both exhibit the same kind of overtone,
uh, series or structure.
Yes. Exactly. Like a harmonic.
Yeah. Like a harmonic. Right. So the image of the external world is a kind of harmonic.
It's a kind of, um, holistic image. So, so the image as a whole has certain properties or
certain features that make it look law governed or law abiding has a certain reason.
But the freedom from the law resembles the freedom from the body.
Exactly. Yeah. So once that grants, that grants insight and understanding.
Right. Understanding awareness.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Insight. Yeah.
So the physical image contains this latent potential, which can be actualized through feedback.
So through feedback, more of the image can be revealed.
That's, that's what I think the Greeks were talking about.
Actually more of the image arises.
It's not just revealed.
Well, you know, it arises in the same sense as the completeness that we were discussing earlier.
Yeah. Yeah. But, okay. So what you're saying is the unveiling,
you're placing the emphasis on the unveiling, which is different from the arising.
There are two competing, um, idol longs here. One is that the nature of being is
unveiled to us. So it is remembered. And the other is that it is being completed by us.
It is, we are, we cause it to arise by interacting with it. You follow?
Well, the completeness I think is, is the same process as the memory. So the red integration, the, um,
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, the reintegration.
Yeah. The reconstitution of the being is something that you supply through knowing it or through
interacting with it, but it's a form of memory in the same way that, um, in the same way that remembering
a fragment of some melody, um, can, can reinstantiate the entire melody. So if, if you access one portion
of the melody, you can reintegrate the totality. And that's, I think what takes place in encountering
beings in the external world in resurrecting them or in, in remembering them, you complete them at the
same time, but their completion is also a function of your own filter. So it's not as if they exist.
They don't like pre they don't pre-exist you. Right? Right. Yeah. They're incomplete before you,
before you encounter them. Oh my God.
Did I, did you invoke me or did I invoke you?
Cause this is absurd, dude. This is ridiculous. You're not supposed to do this.
See, am I, am I giving you like a forbidden fruit here? Is this?
Yeah. Okay. This is not, this is not supposed to be able to happen down here. You do understand that,
right? You, do you have the same sense of that impossibility that we are transgressing together?
No, I don't really feel like I'm breaking the law.
Well, I do. I mean, I'm not breaking the law. It's like, um,
um, I've, I've never participated in conversations like this one. The closest
the conversations with Toymaker are transcendental to this one, but this has the stink of the same
kind of progress. Um, all right. So I don't want to lose the thread by celebrating it, which is one of
the weird ironies of being a human being. Um, it's a bit like taking a photograph of something.
So there's this idea that I know who Nathan is, um, because I know his name and I know I can
imagine something resembling what he looks like. He's this sort of toe headed, um, half angelic,
half awkward sort of guy, young guy that I know. And one of the amazing things about Nathan that I
think is truly beautiful is that it's very clear that he doesn't merely know what to do. He's
discovering what to do as he plays in the possibility space of his, of his moment and his relationships
with others and being a human and being Nathan and all of these things. And that's really amazing.
And there's a conflict in him between the static, uh, Nathan-esque known Nathan. And there's a conflict
between that and the representational layer of human existence, modernity, culture, technology,
systems, structure, roads, cars, rent paying job thing. Right. And there's a conflict between that
and his interiority. Um, we all inherit that conflict, you know, within the Bible and they're
like the sins of your fathers will be visited. And then the actual sin is, is just representational
cognition. Let's be clear. They wasn't like they did a really bad thing or they like decided that we're
going to go into matter and become material beings. That wasn't the sentence. It was like,
we will play with tokens instead of being together with each other. We will tokenize relationships
and thoughts and things, but that, that sin is also important. It's, it's sort of like the first angel.
You can't get, you gotta have that. Um, so one of the things I was, I was so amazing to me is that
we resurrect each other. When we engage in behaviors, like those with wit in which we are engaged right now,
we bring each other into the possibility space of consciousness, awareness, thought, understanding,
insight, intelligence, wonder, awe, um, an amnesis. We bring each other into the space.
I need you to carry me in return. I will carry you and we will unforget together. And we will
we produce a kind of a feedback effect with our minds, right? I give you some juice. It explodes in
you. You give me the result of that explosion. It explodes in me. And we keep going. That's how you
get back up the waterfall. What are your thoughts? I mean, that completely, um, obviates the concept
of an existing static, Darren, exactly existing static, George, right? We bring each other into
existence, or we bring each other into structured death.
Right. Yeah. So you inform an aspect of my own identity, which is very real. But that aspect of
my identity is your reconstruction. So memory is more than just retrieving something that once existed.
Memory is a creative act. So you create, you co-create an aspect of my own identity.
Memory. When you interact. Oh, yeah. Right.
Mnemosyne. Yeah. Is the goddess I will adore. Mnemosyne. Right. She who is memory. Without her, nothing.
Yes. And this relates back to what Nate was saying earlier, or someone. I think it was Nate.
Um, yeah, my identity isn't actually mine. It's not mine to protect, right?
Right. No, this is the thing, right? If I want to be the fingernail of Darren,
then I'll just fucking Darrenize. And I'll be like, you know, Darren's the greatest thing ever. You
should really love him. He's amazing, bro. Darren is the good shit. Right. And on and on and on.
The more that I do that, the more that I'm dead inside. It's not that ego is bad. You need to have
fingernails, right? I don't want my fingernails to go away. But I also don't want to be like the
fingernail on the end of my pinky. That's too limited a scope for my being. And also that if I become that
flat and hardened and angular. Almost all of my capacities for new degrees, new ways of new degrees
of liberty, right? New ways of being a being will disappear. They will disappear into into structure,
repetition. It's a symphonic situation. It's without the body, you can't synchronize the multiplicity
of principles. But the fact of the body can trap you in the appearance of repetition
and trap you in the sense of repetitive consistencies. What do you think?
Yeah, I think the same process also occurs in the natural world, if you look at the evolution
of life as a whole. So the individual, the seemingly individual human being, in its identity or in its
ego, is like a condensed version of what took place on Earth.
Yes. It's the when when you hear this, in like, the Emerald Tablet, right? As above, so below,
as within, so without. What you're what's actually being said is weirder than that. What they're saying is,
there are no forms that are not the unforgetting of origin in structure.
Yeah, because Darwinism posits that an individual being is the object of selection, or a certain
There's no chance of that being true.
Yeah, yeah.
Though you can slice the manifold in such a way that that becomes the most obvious feature of biological
reality. You can slice the manifold that way. That's a way of cutting.
Yes, yes, yes. Go ahead.
Yeah, the identity of the organism is also co created by its environment in the same way that
you co create my, my identity. It's the exact same process.
Yes, yes. See, this is why you can do these things alone, because all of the beings are in you. But when
we come together in the way that we do here. Like both things work, you can anamnese in isolation.
You can joyfully anamnese in isolation. That's possible. It's probably more challenging. It seems
much more fun and interesting to do it with brilliant inspired, you know, playful other beings.
The tree is such a being. Any tree is such a being. But but here.
It's really funny. We are I think we are doing what the Greeks would be very proud of. Socrates, I
think would be like crying with joy in his grave to hear a conversation like this. This is so rare
that the humans get to do this, that they do it in any way that sustains itself.
It's very precious. It's kind of this kind of medicine that we can become together.
Right. And I think it's different. You know, like, when Nate says, I don't know how to take the first
step. Okay. Yet, there's a difference between giving humans instructions
and becoming the way together with and for each other.
Right. I mean, it resembles the salmon at the bottom of the waterfall. Yes.
Asking itself, I don't know how to take the first leap, right? Yes. Also, something that most
people will not really understand that the salmon naturally understand. It's very profound.
Is that we think of individual salmon swimming up a waterfall.
But I'm pretty sure that what happens is that many of the salmon,
some of those salmon that reach the base of the waterfall, they come from the same mother.
Right. Those mothers don't have one or two children.
They have 700 children.
Follow? Yes.
So when they when they're collecting back at the base of the waterfall.
What's happening is like the the minimum signing.
The memory of the mother is materializing at the base of the of the waterfall.
And the spirit of the father who goes, I go. Right.
He is materializing in the between of them. And they draft together.
Right. Multiple children of multiple mothers materializing at the base of the waterfall.
They come from the same stream. They come from the same year of the same time stream.
They come to the base of this waterfall. It's not just the waterfall that is the fucking problem.
There are grizzly bears up there at the top that want salmon brains.
They want to eat some salmon brain. They mostly throw the fish away.
From what I understand, they don't eat the salmon.
They want the brain. They just chomp the brain.
Taste that brain and throw the fish away and grab another one.
So there's lots of weird challenges to get back to the birthplace, the origin place.
What a shockingly brilliant metaphor and nature like if you see if you see a situation like this in
nature, it has 10,000 meanings, not one we're using. We are making expedient use of one of the meanings of
this figure that we see in the salmon swimming up the waterfall, which I love. I think it's amazing.
I love the salmon. I love the living beings. The living beings are the embodied transcendental spirit of
origin alive with eyes and
they are delicate, right? They can suffer.
If you're not embodied, it's pretty hard to suffer. I think
that we have, you know, models of disembodied suffering in hell and so forth.
I don't know. I don't know about that.
I suppose it's, I mean,
Okay, let's just say then that the forms of suffering
very charged, right? To be embodied, it's a different kind of suffering if you are injured or sick or
lost or alone or deprived or, you know, you can't, something bad is happening to your body. It's very,
it's tangible. It's very tangible.
I love the living beings absolutely without any, like, unconditional adoration of living beings,
unconditional adoration. They are heroic. And they are doing, I know this is going to sound weird, but I'm,
I'm basically certain that even when they are confused like our kind of beings are,
which I think is a really weird problem. Why are the humans so stupid?
They are doing something that can, that is invisible, that is beautiful and nourishes the origin world.
It enriches the origin world. But there is a very bad, there seems to be a very bad problem with,
with our kind of, our kind of being with human beings. And
damn, I'm losing a thread that I'm trying to find here.
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
I don't know, it's very weird. You can't find the thread. It disappeared as I was trying to grasp it.
Typical
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Yeah, maybe it needs more time to incubate.
No, I had it. It's a hippocampus thing. My hippocampus
powered down briefly. The thread I was chasing dissolved.
Wow.
What an amazing path we've woven here.
Perhaps it is a good time for us to wind up. How are you feeling, George?
Yeah, I think we're over four hours now, just about.
Okay.
Yeah, I can't even express my gratitude for this.
This is just
I mean, it's like the nectar of being alive dripping into a graveyard of my ordinary life.
Wow, I'm glad to hear that.
I hope, I hope it's somewhat, you know, I hope that resonates with you as well.
Yeah, yeah, it's my lifeline.
Right on.
Yeah, I'm just so grateful.
Not just for those who were here today, and you and Nate.
But those who gave birth to this, you know, I can't imagine what Hugh would make of this conversation.
I have no idea.
Right.
I, I, I think he would, I don't know, like, this is the opposite, though, of doom singing.
And that's what I really love.
I don't, doom singing doesn't help the humans.
Right?
It doesn't help anyone.
It's not clear at all.
Like the bad, bad, bad, bad thing.
It's part, it's a, it's an ingredient in the soup that we make and eat together here.
But that thing, that's just, it's really toxic if that's the main ingredient, right?
Well, the point of doomerism is to get you to die early so that you can resurrect early.
That's the idea.
Die early.
Yeah.
Yeah, die now.
Give up hope, right?
That's, yeah, give it up.
Right.
And then you receive it.
I see.
It's a sort of Black Sabbath thing.
It's like salt soup.
Right.
Yes.
Just suck all the moisture out of me right now.
Desiccate.
If you give up, then maybe you have a chance.
I mean, I think that's the idea.
Then you'll love it.
I don't know.
I like our flavor much better.
It's inspired and inspiring and amnoetic.
And it sings the praises of many beings who have striven for beauty.
And it's more ripe.
It's more mature.
It's more.
Yeah, yeah.
It's fruity.
It's fruity and fragrant, juicy and nectarous.
Yes.
Well, I will go from this to meditation and then to lunch.
But yeah, I'm so grateful for all of the beings who gave us this chance to exist now,
who suffered and strove, sometimes fought, sometimes died,
who spoke and who were silent, who sang and who cried.
All of the many beings, I adore them.
I remember them.
I love them.
They are my family.
You are my family.
So grateful.
You aren't my family.
Thank you.
