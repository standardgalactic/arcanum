so thank you and good evening from my side my name is bernhard posset uh together with nick
shannon i'm kind of holding together uh the center for blight dialectics and this i'm very grateful
to you nick that you have been organizing um in this meeting and over to you and please make an
introduction to this session thank you bernard and um well um this session and uh hopefully a few more
to follow are going to be based on uh authors work who have contributed to the rutledge international
handbook of dialectical thinking uh which i introduced a little while ago and which is
still on on on schedule to be published uh just towards the end of july i'll keep you informed
about that um and so it's really with great pleasure that um michael mascalo or is it muscolo
i think it depends on which part of the world you're in um but he'll correct us on on that
uh has agreed to talk about his chapter uh today uh for for many reasons uh but first and foremost
it's applied dialectical thinking uh which is what cad is all about uh so it's less theoretical
and more about practice and more about practice and secondly um because if the world needs anything
right now it's about creating common ground between polarized parties in the political domain
and that's exactly the subject of mike's chapter today and and thirdly um i just
uh read this morning that students at oxford university my alma mater uh have started protesting
about what's going on between israel the palestinians in gaza and this conflict uh which is truly of
horrendous proportions now um just doesn't seem to have an end to it uh horribly and
we need desperately in this world to figure out how we can resolve these conflicts peaceably without
the huge human suffering and so if dialectical thinking can offer us anything um then i think
mike muscolo's work is probably one huge step forward and so i really commend this session to everybody
and uh hope that um you'll you'll uh find something interesting and useful in it that you can take
forward to your own communities um so thank you very much uh michael for for being here today and uh
i think i should just hand over the floor to you sure thank you so much um i'm happy happy to be here um i will
make a very short introduction because nick just said everything i would have wanted to say um and
by way of my introduction i want to say that i'm just uh have been delighted to be able to work with
nick and anastasia on this project on the dialectical thinking handbook i couldn't have had better more
hard-working smart colleagues it's been wonderful and i appreciate that very much um yes uh the world
is seems to be um imploding in so many different ways um as i was saying to bernard beforehand uh
stephen pinker says that we're living in the best of times um it's hard to disagree with a lot of what he
has to say poverty is down hunger is down disease is down people are living better than they ever have
yet we have such conflict it doesn't feel that way and um it seems as though that things are getting
worse than better in so many different ways so what can we do about that so dialectical thinking is
the antidote to political dogma dialectical thinking is the antidote to dogmatism shannon brinkat
is one of the people who is contributing to the rootledge handbook i he said this in his chapter
and i just love this i think this is so important if there was ever an if only you know we say if only
this happened if only people thought this way things would be different uh that's such a stupid
way of thinking except i'm going to say if only people thought dialectically uh i cannot help but think
that we would not be more reflective that we would be less we would be more humble we would be able to
solve our problems much easier because we're not simply going to run roughshod over our opponents
so what shannon has to say here is so important to me so dialectical thinking we know this we start
off with a thesis and that thesis brings about an antithesis and then that antithesis splits undergoes
differentiation as it accommodates as b accommodates to a we get a splitting and as
a accommodates to b we get the opposite we get more splitting and the final synthesis comes after we
destroy in some sense a and b the off haven of development and we split those a's and b's those
contradictions and we put it together into a higher order synthesis this is dialectical thinking this is
the dialectical process um and our conflict in the world is usually based upon a versus b a is better than
b b is better than a i'm going to try to show you who's got the truth and i think this is our biggest
problem let's start with a study um so you've got um these are american participants in a study you've
got liberal participants and conservative participants and they are all read a policy statement a political
policy statement it's going to be on welfare and the welfare is a generous welfare policy that's being
discussed so you have liberal participants and conservative participants and you tell them
either that the policy is supported by democrats the liberals or that the policy is supported by
conservatives the republicans you ask them to what extent you endorse this agreement this statement well of
course not surprisingly uh when the liberals hear that the policy statement is supported by democrats
they endorse it very highly strangely when the conservatives hear that the generous liberal
policy is supported by republicans they also support it highly and quite interesting this same exact
statement when the liberals hear that it is supported by republicans they don't support it and conversely
when the conservatives hear that the same policy is supported by democrats they don't support it and it
turns out it doesn't matter whether or not the policy statement is generous or not if it's a stringent
policy you get the same exact results now what does this suggest it suggests that when we identify
with a valued ideology we are for us and against them so often what we hear is people saying oh those people
on the other side they don't listen to reality they don't see the facts well frankly the facts don't particularly
matter very much once ideology and an emotional investment in ideology which incidentally we can't avoid
once we are invested in an ideology we'll see things through that ideology and we construct the other
as other rather than us how can we become for each other rather than just for us versus them
that's point one point two in the west and in the united states and much of what i'm going to be talking
about is coming from the states we have an adversarial system of politics we have adversarial politics
there's a whole bunch as we know of governments that we can have we can have an authoritarian
government we can have a hierarchical government such as in china we can have a monarchy and we can have
democracies of course democracy is the worst form of government except of course for all the other
governments that have been tried from time to time and you'll recognize that as the famous quote from
winston churchill democracy is slow democracy is messy democracy has checks and balances it's hard to get
to get things done yet it seems to be up until this point at least the best form of government for
making collective decisions collective decisions for resolving conflict without resorting to violence
and how does it do it well it does a very clever thing it seems to me that democracy replaces war with
adversarial politics war is adversarial but so is our politics so is our democratic politics we debate we
have two people on two different sides of a debate they are adversaries they try to prove each other wrong
if you will they try to win we have voting we have elections we try to win elections and then when we win
elections we go into congress or what have you and we deliberate and we debate and we debate and we
try to come up with solutions and all of which is the outcome of an adversarial process now this is
arguably worked for a long period of time but it relies and adversarial politics relies on something that is
not adversarial adversarial politics relies on shared political virtues an agonistic common ground if you
will and that common political virtue ground are things like this a shared visual vision of the nation
faith in the democratic process the rule of law compromise respect for the other transition of power a
peaceful transition of power from one administration to another the problem is that these political
classic traditional virtues are being deeply strained and an adversarial democracy i suggest splits when the
agonistic common ground is no longer there to hold the two parties or the multiple parties together
in constructive dialogue even of an adversarial sort and so we get what we started to talk about
before we see that there is violence we see strife and we're now seeing it for example in uh colleges and
universities uh with uh young people uh resisting and protesting against the issues in the war in gaza and
so such things so what should we do one thing we could do is we could try to restore traditional political
virtues we could say hey the past we've had traditional political virtues they're going away uh let's fix this
by coming back to an earlier time well let's take a look at that earlier time here's the first election in
the united states who is this thomas jefferson and uh john adams after um the united states after we separated
from nick i mean the uk um what do we have here we have jefferson's uh accolades referring to um uh adams
is that hideous hermaphroditic character where they this is not a a respectful statement we have
andrew jackson and uh adams's son john john quincy adams jackson would refer to adams as a pimp and of
course uh uh adams returns the favor by referring to the uh a divorced uh jackson as a polygamist we
had in the united states something called the civil war which some people might suggest has been fighting
and continuing to be fought since that time and of course we had the 1960s where many forms of authority
were disrupted and we had much violence in the streets which is we see some remnants of that now
so if we try to restore political virtues one of the things we ought to do is to go back and see that
yes those political virtues did in fact work it seems to me that there was much bipartisanship but
there was also a lot of non-bipartisanship we don't see the extraordinarily nasty ways in which
um the democratic process has moved uh over time perhaps the problem is with the very structure of
adversarial politics itself and this is a something that i came upon uh when i was thinking when i when
i teach people how to engage in conflict management and political conflict management we start usually
by engaging in a debate and showing how the political debate doesn't work to solve problems
and then what happens is as i teach try to teach in alternative ways that i'm going to be talking about in
a few minutes minutes based on dialectical thinking and they work so much better but it takes a long
time to make the transition between the adversarial process and the more constructive
dialectical dialogical process why is that it occurred to me it occurs to me that it's because the very
way we think about politic politics power is in an adversarial way we think when we think politics we
think adversary we think power we think power struggle we think battle we think war we think winning
and the opposite of that is very different what if we were able to begin to think of our political
processes not in terms of adversarial structures but more in terms of collaborative or dialectical
processes things would look different and i want to suggest how that might be
so in the adversarial process what we have here is a zero-sum game so there's an election and the
election is very much like the american game of football not like the football the soccer of the
of the uk and then what we have here is we've got big men in uh in in all dressed up in big men
gear uh with protectives and the goal is to get that football to the other side and it's a zero-sum game
because every advance i make comes at your expense and every advance i make comes at your expense and
every advance you make comes at my expense and every advance you make comes at my expense and at the end
there's a winner and a loser and at best you have a tie or a compromise where nobody is particularly
happy that's a zero-sum game and so without shared political virtues what we get is different sides
doing whatever they need to do to win we get attacking and defending we get polarization like
we have now we get solutions political solutions that favor one party over the other party what i'm
going to be asking in a few seconds is well what would it look like if we didn't do that what would
it look like if we did not seek out political solutions that favor one party over another party
but that seek to address the needs of both parties the apparently conflicting needs of both parties
what would that deliberation process look like what would the systemic solutions look like
we misrepresent represent and we dehumanize the other without shared political virtues because we
just want to win and get what we want and we have political gridlock which is certainly what we
have in the united states and i think across the western world can we do better perhaps democracy
isn't done evolving so often we think that our established uh systems that we have now say
capitalism say democracy that this is it we did it it's there it's done it's not going to get any
better this is what many conservatives for example think when they think of capitalism uh you don't have
to go to socialism to replace capitalism you can simply say can capitalism evolve can we do better and
the same i want to suggest this for democracy maybe we're not done evolving maybe we can have a more
evolved democracy and perhaps it might have something to do with collaboration rather than adversarial
democracy how about politics as a form of conflict resolution how about politics as a form of dialectical
engagement we know a lot about conflict resolution we know a lot about development we know a lot about
how the ideas develop and emotions develop through the clash of opposites and how novel new ideas come from
the integration of opposites this ideology is ripe it seems to me for understanding how we can and should
engage in in democratic decision making so i want to suggest that as we can think about a collaborative
democracy what might it look like well i want to suggest that there's two basic phrases two basic modes
of problem solving that we can engage in when we are engaged in political problem solving both partisan
problem solving and political problem solving between countries etc and these two basic phases are
characterized by one trying to meet mutual needs of different parties again we tend to think that
i have my position you have your position and they're in conflict what if we were to look at the mutual
needs behind those conflicting positions and try to meet the needs of each constituency what would happen
second phase is reconciling political ideologies political ideologies are opposing each other
well you've got a and b both can't be true at the same time of course dialectical thinking holds that
premise into some some dubious status well actually no maybe two things can intention develop be true at the
same time in some form and if we dismantle them come up with something better let's start with what the
first process might look like meeting mutual needs as a form of political problem solving again this comes
straight out of very basic conflict management processes so mutually meeting needs through collaborative
problem solving let's start what do you do you identify the needs that motivate clashing opposing political
positions and you find ways to meet stakeholder needs all of them simultaneously to the best you can
maximum gain looks like this now i know that you people in europe don't tend to have this problem
but we sure do we are still debating the death penalty we put people to death so we have one person
i want the death penalty when another person killing is wrong these are two political positions they're in
conflict they're in conflict with each other what do we do about this we can debate back and forth and
when we debate back and forth it goes back and forth and people do not they dig into their solutions when
was the last time you changed your mind in a political debate it doesn't happen so what i'm going to be
talking about very soon is a study that i performed with six people over the a year and a half period
we trained those six people who were from different political parties some were liberals some were
conservatives some were libertarians some supported hillary clinton some supported donald trump
we trained them in both collaborative problem solving and dialectical engagement the two
things i'm going to be talking about two two modes of solving problems and we discussed a series of
issues we tried to propose ways of solving a series of problems one of them being the death penalty
and i'll talk about how that happened in a few minutes so here's one of them the death penalty
when they started off debating the death penalty it went nowhere so what does collaborative problem
solving say it says beneath each political position lies an unmet human need there is a human need a
human reason why people take the positions that they take including the people that you and i think are
crazy and including the people that the people we think are crazy think it's crazy namely us
what do you do you identify those human needs that exist beneath the political positions you seek
out those needs person a seeks out the need of the other as well as him or herself person b
seeks out the need in of the other including him or herself the woman wants has a need for redemption
she wants to see i'm suggesting here in this example that uh people can change that we can take care of
people uh and preserve their lives whereas let's say person one wants the death penalty because he
sees this is the best way of maintaining human safety nobody can commit the act again if they're dead
take these needs and bring them to the surface both of them and get rid of the initial positions
forget about them we don't need them we're about to develop new ones in all likelihood we take
these initial needs we look at them we take what was at one point opposed clashing conflict and we are
now looking at the underlying needs which may or may not be in conflict we identify novel ways suggestions
brainstorm ways of meeting those needs at the same time and then we try to create a solution that meets
both sets of needs an unforeseen solution that nobody could think about beforehand because you
can't think about it without the other person that's how you create common ground common ground is
has to be created it's not simply found we have this notion common ground find common ground as if
there's ground you're standing over there and i'm standing over there we'll find this ground that
already exists well it doesn't exist until you make it you have to actually create the common ground and to
do that you got to break some eggs you got to change what you're thinking now that's what
collaborative problem solving is about and i have to say that it requires something there's a prerequisite
to it and without apology i say this without apology that instead of arguing over positions where we go back
and forth between you and me what we need unapologetically is something akin to empathy it can't be done without it
we need to reach inside of the other we need to find a way to put our own anger indignation offense
aside long enough to see that our interlocutor is a person and we need to try to understand what are the
human needs that human needs that motivate that person if i am a biden supporter that means looking
into the soul the soft underbelly of the trump supporter that means if i'm a trump supporter it
means looking into the soft underbelly of the biden supporter or of the progressive left it indeed
means looking into the soft underbelly of china of russia of ukraine it means looking into the soft
underbelly of israel and even gaza and even hamas and i do not apologize for saying that it means
connecting to the human human needs of the other while acknowledging that that human other may be
engaging in activity and taking positions that you find not only disdainful but perhaps even horrible
we see that that other person's position comes from some set of human need and if we can find that need
and we can try to acknowledge that need we know this that the other person might just reciprocate
and have compassion because they feel the compassion from me to you
it involves seeking the good in the other even the other that we may regard as somehow bad or even
evil we seek the good in that person there is a man named he's one of my heroes his name is daryl davis
davis is a black soul singer and what he has done is he has connected with white members of the ku klux
clan they have discussions they bond over music and other types of things then in looking for the
good in the other person asking them questions being genuinely curious about why it is that they can hate
him if they don't even know him they come to see the kkk that this is simply a human being that's in
across from them and they begin to soften the change and daryl davis has ku klux klan robes in his closet
of people who have given up those robes he didn't go out to try to convert them he tried went out to
try to understand them this is something that is so hard for us to do understandably so
so that's what collaborative problem solving requires it's hard and collaborative problem
solving in the way that i just talked about it meeting mutual needs finding novel ways to meet needs
is good it brings us very far i believe and i can show why that is the case in a few seconds
but it can only bring us so far and the reason for that is that the needs that generate the human
needs to generate political positions and clashing political positions are often ideologically driven
ideologically determined collaborative problem solving of the sort that i just talked about
trying to meet mutual needs works best when you're able to parse off the human needs
from the ideological concerns from the moral concerns themselves that's possible it can be done
but it only goes so far at some point you're going to rub up against ideology because those ideologies
actually create the needs and influence the needs that drive the position so ideologies not only
inform and create needs they actually influence the very positions that were that were that that
people debate over what do you do when you get to that point i suggest that there's something
that we need to do to reconcile ideologies i call it dialectical engagement or ideological engagement
and it looks like this you find the kernel of truth in each party's ideologies
and you construct novel partially shared ideologies so here's two people they have their ideologies
those ideologies inform and drive positions what you do is seek mutual kernels of truth she's going
to ask maybe she has to squint a lot maybe she has to ignore a lot maybe she has to hold her nose but
she can find something in this person's ideology that she can agree with because this person is human
and the same is true the other way and what you can do is construct partially shared beliefs not fully
shared they're going to be fragmented but it's a start and i say that this needs to be done and can
be done regardless of the ideologies and i i believe that so yes i say to you this is possible yes this is
possible let me show you how so here's an example capital punishment in the united states the death
penalty we have the death penalty in many states and in other states we don't what do we do about
this it's a big issue so one of the issues that my group of six people were discussing was capital
punishment again as i said to you we started off with a debate and that debate did not go well
and then we engaged in these two spheres of problem solving the first one meeting mutual needs
through collaborative problem solving now note what happens the moment you shift from political debate
over solutions to problem solving anybody knows anybody knows anything about problem solving knows
that the most important step in the problem solving process is the first one representing the problem
if the problem is should we have the death penalty or not it's over there's no problem to be solved
because that's not the problem the problem is how do we respond to heinous crime how do we respond
to heinous crime now second we ask that question we can ask well what are our needs what are the goals
what are the needs that we're trying to meet and that's the first thing we asked what are the needs
that we're trying to meet when someone commits a heinous crime what are our needs and the group came
up with the following there's a need for justice vengeance maybe consequences there's a need to
keep the public safe there's a need for prevention there's a need to understand the origins of heinous crime
there's a need for fairness in the criminal justice system that if we're going to try people it
should be fair across race socioeconomic status gender etc we need to address the pain of the victims
of perpetrators who have committed heinous crimes these are the problems the needs that need to be
addressed and again they come from a re-asking of the question now second you got the needs out there
now you've got something to talk about now you've got something that is not necessarily going to divide the
people now we come up with possible solutions how is it possible for us to address all of these needs
at the same time is it possible and then you brainstorm and over weeks and many weeks of meeting two hours
every once a week this is what the group came up with this is what everybody in the group was able to
agree upon here's some shared solutions that came up and i won't go into detail but you'll see
immediately that the agreement was massive how do you keep the public safe there was full agreement
that imprisonment was necessary life imprisonment perhaps necessary that rehabilitation was necessary
if possible there was agreement that there was a need for prevention there was agreement that part of
that prevention has to do with socialization fostering moral understanding in children
teaching children restorative justice everyone agreed on this teach boys and men self-control
address conceptions of masculinity teach people how not to be victims note these are some some
things that could be potentially disruptive could address conceptions of masculinity i would imagine
some people being upset about that toxic masculinity people might be upset about that idea but once people
feel safe enough that their concerns are going to be addressed a lot of that drops away and people
are able to agree upon it prevention systematic changes in society we need a national discussion of
values people agreed early child education and family intervention health care and mental health
services needed to be improved economic development
there was an agreement that we have to understand origins of hamas crime through research and the funding of
research people agreed that there was a need for fairness in the criminal justice system by
creating fair procedures addressing race and social economic status in those procedures
reorganizing police values note that that says reorganizing for police values not defund the police
training police and community skills having partnerships with communities treating prisoners as people
eliminating for-profit prisons there was a need to find ways to address the
victims families pain through restorative justice making amends having the perpetrator show self-transformation
and even finding ways to support grieving and forgiveness in victim
and then the big one justice just deserts consequences people agreed that prison restorative justice and even
some form of public shaming was something that they would entertain now that's a system what you have
before you is a system and it's a lot that's not nothing there's an awful lot of things that people can agree
upon once they feel safe and once it is that we focus on needs rather than debating solutions
but then this rings us right up against ideology despite the fact that this massive agreement is possible
it runs up against ideology there's still disagreement there are still people who are going
to say i want capital punishment i don't want capital punishment what do we do with that
well let's get into the process of ideological engagement so here's maureen and cliff two people
who are in the the group let's look at their ideologies maureen believes the unitary universalist
principle of the inherent dignity of all persons she believes that some people have diminishing
diminished responsibility and pre predisposing conditions that make them liable to commit crimes even
heinous crimes she believes that people are capable of redemption she believes that capital
punishment does not always make victims families whole she believes that collective that criminal
that collective punishment capital punishment makes us killers cliff done by it some people are evil
they are irredeemable he says heinous crime must seek some sort of justice or revenge there's a need
to balance the moral scales perpetrators should get their just resorts people must be held responsible
and victims need justice and protection death of the other will bring closure to those people
so what do we do let's start with cliff's first ideological belief some people are evil they're
irredeemable we ask maureen maureen maureen understand cliff let cliff talk about this is there anything
in what cliff has to say that you can agree with is there any kernel of truth in there no matter how much
you have to squint here's a dialectical process here is a dialectical conversation uh here is a conversation
where i'm going to mark thesis antithesis synthesis as to the best it actually occurs you'll see the
conflicts and the resolutions as they move forward and they're typically partial so cliff says some
people are evil they are irredeemable maureen says this may be true but it's very rare however if it's
very rare it conflicts with maureen's belief in the inherent dignity of all people can't be very rare
and there be inherent dignity of all people or maybe even with those people where for whom it's
very rare they still have dignity but there's a conflict here cliff says there are psychopaths
who kill without empathy and gives many examples of this he was a police officer
hmm perpetrators there's inherent dignity of all people but i have to see that i find it hard to
find inherent dignity in a psychopath who kills without empathy she says so therefore she comes
to a point where she says okay there's inherent dignity but almost all people now this seems like
a very small change but it's a change but it's not such a small change this is a religiously held
belief the inherent dignity of all people look at the direction of the change here this surprised me
i didn't expect this at all that maureen would move in the direction of of of embracing the sanctity
of life to suggesting that somehow that maybe that might be that not all people are worthy of dignity
to be sure at this point she's still rather unclear about this but here's the dialectical process
let's go to another example so she moves from her position to inherent dignity of all people to
inherent dignity of almost all people what about this one heinous crime balance the moral scales
another dialectical process cliff we must avenge evil avenge evil that we need to get revenge upon
those who create evil think about it think about all the movies about revenge a the cowboy uh is out
there to get revenge on the person who did this horrible thing the revenge is the way to way to go
maureen doesn't like revenge revenge she says though there's a belief i have heard of about revenge
it's not really revenge she says that when you seek revenge what you're really doing is you're finding
a way to make the perpetrator experience how it feels when you give revenge you're not just
trying to punish the person she's saying but you're you're showing the perpetrator how it feels
ah cliff isn't having it now it's to avenge the evil it's to balance the moral scales
um maureen begins to suggest no i don't like this business about about avenging more scales or revenge
how about the concept of consequences can we agree upon the concept of consequences that at least there
needs to be some form of consequences cliff agrees now is this a remarkable transformation it is a
transformation cliff didn't change his ideas about evil but he has accepted both of them have moved
closer to each other and being able to address the consequences the concept of consequences rather than
the consequences of revenge and cliff actually said at one point i don't mean revenge i don't mean
vengeance i mean something else something has emerged here now i can go through and i can give
you more examples perpetrators should get their just desert deserts people should be held responsible
both were able to agree yes we need justice but consequences is a better concept than revenge
i'll give you just one more example victims need justice protection death brings closure says cliff
here is the exchange ellie another person in the group talked about how
how parole takes a toll on the victim's family that people who are published punished for capital
given capital punishment they don't go to death for a long time they sometimes get parole and then
when the parole issue comes about the victim's family has to relive this process all over again
oh my god maureen says i haven't attended enough to victims needs
um and if i haven't attended the victim's needs that contrasts and conflicts with my view of the
inherent dignity of all people anti-death penalty advocates have not adequately addressed the needs
of victims families change has happened within maureen and change happens in cliff as well i'm not going
to go into it i'll just show you that it exists and that there's all we can look at very interesting
developmental changes and cliffs that come from the dialectical process this leads to
the following all six people in this case were able to agree on the following all the things i told
you about before keeping the public safe through those strategies prevention through socialization
and social change understanding the origins of heinous crime fairness in the terminal justice system
addressing the pains of victims families and they were able to construct partially shared beliefs on the
ideological aspects itself the inherent dignity of almost all three people some people have diminished
capacity and disposing conditions some people perpetrators must be held responsible subject to their
capacities for control there are need for consequences for heinous crime many but not all perpetrators are
capable of redemption there's a need to address the needs of victims families and capital punishment only makes some
victims whole and not others now we did not solve the problems of capital punishment but that's not
nothing that is an enormous as far as i'm concerned a set of beliefs that people agree upon instead of
strategies that people agree upon we never get to these in an adversarial system we go and we debate
piecemeal solutions without ever looking at the underlying problems we are debating the solutions while
characterizing the others as the others is out of touch etc if you're able to make the parties feel safe
address needs over time you can create solutions and once people feel safe enough they're able to engage in
dialectical dialogue that can lead to novel shared beliefs
so what do you do with all this how can you move forward i am not so naive as to believe that voting
and adversarial politics are going to go away anytime soon they are not they are here are they dysfunctional
i think they are can democracy evolve i think it can how well there think globally act locally
i believe that if we are able to begin to get people in their everyday lives in their professional
lives in their political lives to begin to learn these sorts of strategies and ways of thinking about
self and other the idea of connecting to the humanity of the other the actual process of separating needs
from positions the process of dialectical thinking that when i see the opposing thought i don't immediately
think that that has to be wrong but in fact i am entered into a dialogue with that thought and the
moment i begin to think that that thought may have some credulous credibility the reading at the moment
i treat that thought with that other person as credulous rather than incredible i become humble i must
be able to at this point begin to reflect upon what am i thinking is and accommodate it to yours if possible
and you to me it's not a giving in it's a clash of opposites a breaking down possibly of opposites and a
synthesis and integration of opposites to get to a higher level i believe this can be done starting
locally not globally it starts with little kids it starts by bringing it into teaching people to do
this and bring it into their relationships into their marriages into their schools into their
organizations into their local org spats in their organizations into the communities into the church
into the local government and little by little by little by little by little as people can see
my hope is that once that you can see that's that we can resolve conflicts better than we think that
we might that we ordinarily can that it can ripple and then perhaps prominent people look at it and they
say look this is possible we need to promote this and why prominent people don't do this already
uh is beyond me because it's based on fear so much of our so much fear is at the root of all of our of so
much fear and humiliation fear and humiliation and the antidote to fear and humiliation is connecting
to the humanity of each other and that's hard
that's what i got i stopped wonderful michael thank you so much um before everybody came we were
thinking about how to frame and how to start the conversation after your presentation and i think one
of our ideas was if you have a question for the participants rather having a standardized q&a session with
you um well the question that i have for participants um i can't help but thinking that it's really the
question that they have about it which is what are you crazy um you must be silly uh this is pie in the
sky in the sky nonsense um how do you get people to put down their defenses you're naive
is this naive maybe that's the question um or let's state it differently
in what ways is it possible specifically if desirable
to put these starts to strategies into practice on a local level
or are there times when it's justified to go and bomb the other
those are some questions that come to my mind and again my hope would be that
i become one of you and we have a discussion rather than it's to me
that before my suggestion thank you michael
how exciting
yeah i've been thinking hard about as i get more out of my head
and into the concrete details of things how is it do you get right to the core of the experience of
compassion and empathy and understanding the needs of the other when you're so angry
and that the more concrete and you've talking about
painting on concrete you have more concrete than that
uh the more concrete the better go development goes from the concrete and the experiential to the
abstract and we always go at least i do from the abstract to the concrete it's got to be the other way
i think one of my questions is how can we um what's the motivation for people to join a conversation at
all so michael you were sharing the example of these people these six people i think going into
dialogue and and probably a person facilitating this dialogue and this must have been many hours
i assume at least and why did they do it at all why did they do it or also you shared the example of
daryl davis the the black person who was um having these dialogues with um kukuk's clan members
so you find on the website i just shared a book that he wrote about the kukuk's clan and also why
did these people even talk to him so what's the first motivation maybe you can say something about this
yes i can uh there are two motivations why people participated in the group that i did one is
because all of them had some caring about the problems of polarization uh and then there was
the less important one uh very very distant in the in the background which was that i paid them uh to do
it so there was that um but the the example of daryl davis is fascinating i'm going to get it wrong
uh but you'll get the gist so he is the only black man in a a country music uh a band and they're
playing in some bar somewhere white people and somebody comes over uh to him and says you know
i really like your playing i've never seen a black man or heard a black man play this music before
okay they're playing blues they're playing they're playing jazz um and they were playing jerry lee lewis
songs and so he started to bond oh you like jerry lee lewis he goes yeah he goes um uh uh and daryl
davis is the guy you know uh jerry lee lewis learned this from a black man you realized oh no jerry lee
this is jerry lee lewis song no black man could play like this excuse me i know jerry lee lewis he's a
friend of mine it says daryl davis and now now this person has now got a conflict he's got an
internal conflict how can i believe at the same time that blacks are inferior that that that the
music that i love that i feel this concrete visceral connection to is created by somebody who i see as
anathema and then they begin to bond over the music and then they begin to have conversations and again
it comes it's the relationship stupid it's the seeing the humanity in this case the shared love
and movement of music and the internal conflict i mean that's the thing is that i don't think that
we really appreciate is enough and piaget said this the best in many ways the role of internal conflict
and motivating development when i so i have x if i have concept a and i also have concept b and we do
it we are fragmented inside and they conflict with each other the moment somebody draws my attention to
that i'm motivated how do i do both at the same time and that's what leads to development
in my view has there been any follow-up with cliff and maureen
to find out whether they still agree or whether they've reverted to their original positions
as we bring up children through school they're taught that there's right and wrong and there's
taught they're taught that there is a right answer to certain questions and so their understanding
of what's true and what's correct knowledge becomes somewhat fixed
and how do you go about kind of unlocking that because it seems to me that your process requires
a fair amount of flexibility in people's thought process and willingness to accept that truth may be
somewhat less fixed than commonly children are taught
a fair amount of flexibility in people's thought process and willingness to accept that truth
one uh nick uh maureen still feels the same way that she does i haven't talked to cliff about it
uh um cliff the trump supporter the trump supporting guy who when i
told my car and my insurance company wouldn't pay for the totaling he found me people who would fix my
car for less for whatever the insurance company would pay and so i know it's a trend it's a it's not
to answer your question but look at the wonderful compassion of this person who who we would who many
people would simply dismiss on the basis of his of his politics uh but um that's all i got to say about
that um excellent okay i want to answer um i believe uh uh i believe i've come to believe um in a way
of thinking that i call moral relationalism moral relationalism we have this idea that there's right and
wrong and we try to buttress our theory of right and wrong in some ground that ground is god that
ground is nature that ground is kant's mind universal moral principles i don't believe that they're that
these grounds exist i believe that the grounds that exists are relationships are our relations that in
every given context there are multiple goods multiple constraints that exist between you and i
and that we must decide morally what is good in that context as a basis of all the constraints
so nick you're eating and i take the bread out of your mouth and because i want it and because i'm
hungry and i want it and then you cry and then you get angry and you lash out at me so now we've got
three needs my hunger your anger your your your hunger your hurt all these things together we need to put
together to find the moral rule that's where it comes from it's always open-ended and constrained
now how you how you do that how do you get that moral understanding and kids etc i suggest you know
do you need a mediator all the time i say you need a mediator in the same way you need a mediator to do
calculus in the same way that you need a mediator to tell the time those mediators are called cultural
agents they're called parents they're called teachers vygotsky says okay you know any higher
order function and the child's development occurs twice on two levels on the social level than the
individual level we learn to tell time by taking the cultural process of those words teaching it over
time with the kid the kid internalizes it now the kid can do it himself you do it the same with
calculus and everything it's got to get built into the culture and we have to do it in our culture and
then only and then does it get into the kid then it moves forward so yeah uh the the the the process is
hard and monumental and it just strikes me about the the paucity the the the pusillanimous nature of our
of our capacity to resolve conflict in our culture that's what's going to change their cultural
processes that's my that's what i think thank you for stimulating that thought
thank you sir would it be appropriate for me uh bernard to ask uh to to state um you say you're
studying in socio-emotional intelligence or socio-emotional aspect of conflict could you
maybe comment about what it is that you're doing or what it is that you think are the is the most
important socio-emotional aspect of of this process in conflict management may i ask that for at least
briefly
when i first came across otto's work um i found it interesting how he was making distinctions between
cognitive and cognitive and social emotional development and first of course um not of
course but first i made a mistake maybe some others also seem to make that that i kind of saw them
separated like distinct but not connected um and so only now more and more of course i see how it's
possible to talk about them and it's good to have a language for talking about them separately and not
mixed but at the same time um always having in mind how they're how they cannot be separate
and i think what what we could what i could hear from what you shared michael
is that a dialectical approach is very helpful to support people as a mediator facilitator but without
having social emotional grounding in oneself and in in one's communication it's more or less
impossible probably to execute if if this is the correct word this dialectic maybe you could correct
or or enlarge no i think that's correct i think that you can't do it without the socio-emotional
the social emotional part of it um the social emotional relational part of it
you know sadly in my opinion how can i say this in the states and maybe it's also in in the uk
there's a tremendous movement toward socio-emotional understanding and promoting it in the schools
but it's in my opinion wrong-headed what it does is it prompts the student to reflect upon his or her
own plight if you will it doesn't get the person to get into the experience of the other and to see
that courage is needed in order to connect to the other because they are often devoid of values
in the united states people like to teach in a value neutral way they don't want to go to the
value they don't want to say that here's the way in which you should be in relation to other people
we need that we need we need to help people develop the type of socio-emotional intelligence
that gets them out of themselves and into the other uh in a in a in a in a value in a value sensitive way
and there is one link we i haven't shared yet which is the link to your book michael or one of
your books from conflict to collaboration maybe you want to say a few sentences is what you presented
today would we find it also in this book or find much of it in the book we wouldn't find the political
stuff in the book but it's the foundation for the political stuff the interpersonal is the foundation for the
for the political stuff there's more but thank you thank you so much everybody for being here for
sharing and for creating this space together goodbye see you next time
