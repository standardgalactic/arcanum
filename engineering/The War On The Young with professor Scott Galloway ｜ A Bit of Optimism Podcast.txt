To be rich in America is to be loved, full stop.
It's a violent, rapacious place.
If you don't have money, it's a loving, generous place
if you do have money.
Once you hit your number, there's no reason to be a hoarder
because this is what makes you happy.
Spend it.
I spend so much fucking money and it's amazing.
And then you know what I do?
I give it away.
And so what I would say to anyone else
who has a lot of money,
why do you need to be a billionaire?
It's not going to get you anything.
Here's what you do.
You do amazing things with friends and family.
You take care of your parents.
You fly your friends to Aspen to hang out with you.
And then anything above that, you give it away.
And there's so many amazing causes and people
and overpay the people who work with you.
Throw money around like you're a fucking gangster
in the 50s diagnosed with ass cancer.
Just live it up.
And you know what?
You're going to love life.
Don't do it because you're noble.
Don't do it because you're praying to some God
or whatever it is.
I can tell you firsthand, it feels amazing.
Thanks for joining.
It's really good to see you.
It's always good to see you.
And congratulations on the TED Talk, the new book.
Lots of busy things happening.
Thanks, Tom.
When you got invited to do the TED Talk,
did they ask you to do a particular subject
or did you just, did you say to them,
this is what I want to talk about?
No, I had lunch with Chris Anderson
who I've known for 20, 30 years in London.
And he said, we're thinking about having you at TED
as if I'd, you know, been crowned.
He didn't commit to giving me a speaking site.
He said, we're thinking about it.
And I said, well, first off, thanks.
That's exciting.
And he said, what's your vision for a talk?
He said, if you were to do a talk, what would it be?
He didn't even offer me the slot yet.
And I said, I think that the thing
that people aren't talking enough about
is I believe that almost every economic policy
is nothing but a thinly veiled transfer of wealth
from the entrance to the incumbents
and more loosely from young to old.
And he said, okay, so how would you brand it?
I'm like, well, I've been thinking about this.
I think there's a war on the young.
He said, that's the talk and we want to have you.
And I wasn't sold myself
because Vancouver from London is a real haul.
And I'm trying to be more,
someone said, I love the saying,
be generous with everything except your time.
I'm pretty cheap with my time now.
And anyway, so I did it.
And then I thought this is something
I feel passionate about.
So I rallied the team
and I get a lot of nice feedback around,
wow, that's so much data.
It's, you know, greatness is in the agency of others.
I probably spent eight hours on that talk,
but I bet there was 800 hours that went into it.
And so my team immediately started pulling together data
and, you know, it's 110 slides.
It was chilling, I would say is a good word,
how stark your conclusions were,
your insights were.
And I think it really does point to
sort of a brokenness of capitalism where,
and you know better than I do about this stuff,
but my understanding is that the original concept
of the stock market was that the average working person
could share in the wealth of a nation.
And what's happened in the past 30, 40 years
is that the middle class is leaving the stock market
and it's become the playground
literally of the top 1% or maybe slightly bigger.
At least it's that small percentage
that are benefiting most at the expense.
And then we see, and you know,
I rail against this kind of stuff,
you know, where companies announce mass layoffs
because they missed their projections.
They're profitable,
just not as profitable as they promised the street.
And so you get to lose your job.
And this all benefits the stock market.
You know, when companies announce layoffs,
the price of their equity goes up.
Announce R&D, your equity goes down.
To call it the war in the young,
I think speaks to this
very large and growing populist movement
that we're seeing both in the United States
and around the world.
Yeah, so one of my intellectual role models
is Peter Drucker, the economist.
He said that the purpose of an economy
is to create a middle class.
And I think the greatest innovation in history
is not the iPhone or the semiconductor
or the printing press.
I think it's the middle class.
This idea that the largest segment of your population
gets to register the prosperity of an economy
and they fight your wars,
they pay the majority of your taxes,
they're responsible for the majority
of the framework for real future innovations,
and they create sort of a neoliberal society
that decides, you know,
we'd like to share some of our privilege
and start affording rights to other people.
I think that's the greatest innovation in history.
But it's not what the incumbents
and sometimes the far right will tell you
is that it's a natural occurring organism.
It's not.
Capitalism that's unfettered
results in a small group of very talented people
who aggregate incredible capital
and then have access to cheaper capital
and can kind of run away with the game show
and then they weaponize government.
I mean, this is what Central America is.
A group of talented people figure out
a way to license Unilever or AB InBev brands.
They get more capital.
They support the next president.
They get regulatory capture.
And they end up with so much of the economy
that the bottom 99% says
the easiest way for us to double our wealth
is to kill these people and start over again.
And then another group of people emerges as the 1%.
If capitalism doesn't have a pay it forward
reinvestment in the middle class,
it does collapse on itself.
It's also a bit of a zeitgeist thing.
And that is, I've been watching a lot of the D-Day.
I'm obsessed with World War II,
the D-Day memorials.
And I was wondering myself, like, if I were called,
I like to think if I were called, I would have gone.
But I also believe that, if I'm really honest with myself,
if my sons were called,
I think I would use my influence and wealth
to get them out of it.
And I think Americans have, over the last 50 years,
slowly but surely, and I don't know what,
I don't know what are the underlying dynamics,
but I think we've become inherently
a little bit more focused on me.
And we see so many people.
This is kind of your ballywick.
When you have a candidate for president
who's just so nakedly self-serving
and people find that admirable,
when you have tech billionaires
that seem pretty focused on getting
from $1 billion to $100 billion,
even if it involves depressing teenage girls,
and they win, and we love them,
then it creates this incentive system in the U.S.
where people decide, it really is about me.
It's no longer about reinvesting in the middle class.
And as a result, you have incumbents,
25 wealthiest people in America
pay an average tax rate of 8%.
And we have a series of elected officials
who are in a system where they need to get money
to be reelected.
The people with money are the incumbents.
And what do you know?
Old people keep voting in.
Older people who keep voting themselves more money.
And now we're at 40% of all government spending
is on people over the age of 65.
It's about to go over 50%,
meaning we're not going to be able
to make the forward-leaning investments
in technology and education
that, quite frankly, pay off
and bring more people into the middle class.
And then the older people
who tend to be the executives,
they're the ones in charge,
just by virtue of time and age,
then they complain about the lack of loyalty
from the young employees
failing to recognize
that they're the ones that set the rules.
They demand loyalty.
They demand you kiss the ring,
but they offer nothing in return.
And then they're surprised
at this young generation
that is doubling down on the rules
that the older generation set,
which is me before we.
You know, I think you're 100% right,
which is, especially in the United States,
over-indexed on rugged individualism.
You know, the Marlboro man works too well.
Right.
And we heroized CEOs.
CEOs became heroes rather than the teams.
And I think when we talk about,
you know, would you go to war
or would you allow your kids to go to war,
the times that we live in are the context.
And you're saying I would, you know,
I would use my wealth and influence
to get them out of it.
But if it was 1941,
I'm not so sure that would be true.
You know, at least in the United States,
you know, there were more suicides
from young men who didn't get called
than ones who did.
That's interesting.
Which is an astonishing thing.
And if you think about
the collective desire to help, right?
So people who could went to war
in some way, shape, or form.
They put on a uniform to support
in some way, shape, or form.
Those who didn't fight
bought war bonds to support the effort.
And those who couldn't afford war bonds
were contractors.
Planted war gardens.
They just did something,
even if it was symbolic,
to demonstrate that we are one.
I think one of the...
So the capitalism collapsing on itself
is a bit of a far left narrative.
Let me give some nod to the far right.
I think that the fact
that Americans haven't been attacked
on our homeland other than 9-11,
we're energy independent,
we're food independent,
friendly Canada to the north,
harmless Mexico to the south.
I don't think a lot of people
in America realize
there's a large swath of people globally
who the moment they feel like
they can take with force
our Netflix and our Nespresso
away from us,
we'll do it in a second.
And that I don't think
they really understand
or nod to the amount of sacrifice
that was made by previous generations
to...
And also very brave young men and women
who are in the uniform right now
and some of our people
who work in government
and our security apparatus.
I don't think Americans
have the same level of fidelity
or appreciation
for just how hard it is,
how much energy,
how much money it takes,
how much sacrifice it takes
to get to the levels of freedom
and prosperity
that America enjoys.
I feel like America
has become entitled,
my generation on down,
because every time
we've been asked to sacrifice
while we've been alive,
it's been for a failed war.
Iraq was stupid,
going into Southeast Asia,
supporting the French colonization
or recolonization
after World War II
ended up being a disaster.
So I think people
just take for granted
that, oh, we're special,
all of this prosperity
doesn't require sacrifice.
It requires a ruthless devotion
to uber-capitalism
and doing what you can
to get to a certain point.
Now, to your point
around the CEOs
believing that young people
are entitled,
it's just such bullshit.
When you look at the level
of compensation of CEOs
relative to young people,
it's gone from 30 to 300.
Oh, wait, let me get this,
David Zasloff.
You cut the stock in half.
You're firing people like crazy,
but you walk away
with a quarter of a billion dollars
and, oh, you're going to make sure
that you give enough money
to senators like Kristen Sinema.
You give her $2 million
and she makes sure
as the swing vote
that the tax credit
for carried interest
for private equity funds
maintain a $12 million tax cut.
The most disappointing thing
about our government right now,
it's not that they're whores.
They've been whores
for a long time.
It's what incredibly cheap whores
they are.
And the greatest return
on investment in our economy
is for an organization,
a special interest group,
a lobbying group,
for the rich
or for corporations
to go spread a little bit
of money around
and find out,
oh, we need to protect
the shoe market
in case there's a war
and we need boots
or we need this tax cut
for people in the real estate industry.
And it does feel a little bit
like it's collapsing on itself,
that if we don't,
as citizens,
and elect people
who are a little bit more
long-term thinking
and recognize
there's just no fucking reason
why people who make their money
selling stocks
should have a lower tax rate
than people sweeping up the floor
at the New York Stock Exchange.
When did capital become,
the capital that capital makes
become more noble
than the capital that sweat makes?
Shouldn't it be flipped?
Even Ronald Reagan said
this is bullshit
and he had one tax rate.
So effectively,
every big tax thing
that goes through,
every big expenditure,
to name it,
is really about
a transfer of wealth.
$30 billion child tax credit.
Who does that benefit?
Not only the children,
but young mothers, right?
That gets stripped out
of the infrastructure bill.
We can't do it.
It's too expensive.
$30 billion.
We need to be responsible.
But the $140 billion
cost of living adjustment
in Social Security,
each year,
another $140 billion
flies right through.
No discussion of means testing.
You and I should never
have Social Security.
No way.
Let's call it senior security.
It's not Social Security.
And it's called a tax.
It's not a pension fund.
All this bullshit.
Well, I paid into it.
It's a tax.
It's meant to be redistributed
to people who need it.
Capital gains tax deduction,
mortgage tax deduction.
Who owns homes?
People our age.
Who rents?
The younger people here.
It is everything we do
is how do we buttress
the wealth of incumbents
and old people
and make it more expensive
for young people.
Their housing's gone up 4x, right?
Education's gone up 2x.
On an inflation-adjusted basis,
their income's gone down.
So they make less money.
Everything they need to get ahead
or start saving
or form a family
has gotten more expensive,
and yet they look left
and riding up,
and they see people
making tons of money
and 210 times a day
on their phone.
People are vomiting
their wealth,
a lot of times
faux wealth.
And what do you know?
They feel shitty.
What a shocker.
So how do we fix it?
Short of revolution.
That was a rant.
Short of revolution.
Because you and I,
you know better than most
that the way revolutions happen
is when the delta
between the haves
and the have-nots
gets too wide.
100%.
Short of revolution.
Right.
And some may argue
it's already begun.
Yeah.
How do we fix it?
Look,
the good news
about income inequality
is when it gets
to a certain level,
it always self-corrects.
Yeah.
The bad news
is the means of self-correction
are usually war, famine,
or revolution.
Yeah.
I would argue
that a lot of the social
uprising in the U.S.
is more what I call
a series of mini-revolutions.
I don't think
what's going on
on campuses
in the United States
is about the Middle East.
I think it's about America.
It's anti-establishment.
This level
of income inequality
and dissatisfaction
is incendiary
poured on every small fire.
It turns a dumpster fire
into a nuclear mushroom cloud.
There's just rage everywhere.
Now, what do we do?
I think the good news is
we don't even need
to come up with
creative solutions.
We just need to go back
to the future.
We need a much more
progressive tax rate.
And I'm not talking
about the super earners.
If you make a lot of money
on current income
and you live in a blue state,
you're probably paying
50, 52 percent.
The super earners
are actually paying too much.
But once you make
the jump to light speed
and you, say,
get lucky like me
and you sell a company
for nine figures
and you can take
all of that money
and put it into
income earning assets
that appreciate in value,
you become a super owner
and your tax rate plummets.
And I'm very transparent
about my wealth.
I think that this gestalt
or this vibe
that you're not supposed
to talk about money
is nothing but a thinly veiled
attempt to keep poor people poor
because rich people
talk about money
all the time.
The guy who runs the company
and it's almost always
the guy knows
what everybody makes.
So asymmetry of information
benefits the incumbent.
So what we have
is a series of policies
that, again,
don't make any sense
for young people.
So a more progressive tax structure
on the super owners.
Eliminate capital gains deduction.
Everybody pays one rate,
have an alternative minimum tax
for corporations
and very wealthy people.
Right now,
corporations are paying
the lowest tax rate
they've paid since 1939.
It used to be 2.5% of GDP.
Now it's 1%.
There are five companies,
Nike, FedEx,
a bunch of them
that paid Amazon
that paid no taxes.
The tax code has gone
from 400 pages
to 4,000, right?
And all of it
is a bunch of loopholes
meant to give money back
to big organizations.
Apple's the most profitable
company in history.
They incorporate in Ireland
such that they can
increase their taxes
or increase their pre-tax revenue
in a low-tax domain
and decrease their revenue
in a high-tax domain.
That is nothing
but sheer tax avoidance.
We need alternative minimum tax
on the super wealth
and corporations
and you could actually
lower taxes
across the super earners
and youth.
So redo our tax policy
to be more,
quote-unquote,
just equitable.
Restore a progressive tax rate.
Two more opportunities
for young people,
specifically broader
freshman class.
College is still
the best on-ramp
into the middle
or upper-income classes.
Harvard has grown
its endowment 40-fold,
4,000 percent,
but it's increased
its freshman class size 4%.
It lets in about
the same number of people
that a good Starbucks does.
If you aren't growing
your freshman class size
faster than population growth,
you should lose
your tax-free status
because you're now
a hedge fund offering classes.
You're not public servants.
And in addition,
instead of bailing out
one-third of kids
who got to go to college
with student loan bailouts
on the backs
of the two-thirds
that didn't,
we should take some
of that money
and give it to our
great public universities
in exchange for three things.
One, they increased
their freshman class size 6%.
With the depth use
of technology,
they could easily do.
There's no one there at night.
There's no one there
during the summers.
I work at one of these places.
We could easily expand
our freshman class size, too.
Reduce costs 2% a year.
We could do that with scale
and more students
and technology.
A third of my faculty,
and they're some of the best
in the world,
should be put on an ice float.
They're not only not adding
any value because they're
not adding any value.
They get angry
and disruptive
and get in the way
of progress.
That is nothing
but student debt
layered on young people.
Ethics, leadership,
sustainability,
it's all bullshit
and self-aggrandizement
from a group of people
who decided they're
no longer centers
of excellence.
They're social engineers.
I mean, just think about
how fucking arrogant that is.
We're not elected by anyone,
but we've decided
we should train
a new generation of youth
around what they should care about
and what social policy
should be.
Here's an idea.
Give them the skills
they can go make
a bunch of money
and take care of their families
and then pay taxes
to a group of people
who are elected
who then decide
our social priorities.
And then finally,
20% of all degrees
should be vocational certifications,
non-traditional four-year degree,
two-year and specialty nursing,
one year in construction
of nuclear power plants,
18-month vocational program
and the installation
of energy-efficient HVAC.
There are a ton
of Main Street economy jobs
that pay six figures plus
that we're not training kids for.
Here in the U.K.,
11% of LinkedIn profiles
say Apprentice.
It's 3% in the U.S.
More freshman seats,
lower costs for college,
and we need federal laws
that say if you get in the way
of housing permits,
you're liable if you found
that this obstruction
wasn't ethical.
We need a million and a half
more housing permits per year
because this is what is happening.
Once you and I own a home,
we start showing up
to the local review board
and we get very concerned
about traffic
and we find ways
to make sure
that no housing permits
are ever issued
such that people
who work with you
can't afford a goddamn home.
Pre-COVID 2019,
homes are $290,000.
They're $420,000 a day.
And with the acceleration
in interest rates
because we keep spending money
on their goddamn credit card,
mortgages have gone
from $1,100 to $2,300.
It used to be two-thirds
of Americans could afford a home.
Now it's one-third,
so they can't afford a home.
They're getting taxed
like fucking crazy.
And everyone above them
is making a shit ton of money.
I'm in the club
with champagne and cocaine.
And the closest
the next generation
gets to the club
is they can throw me
their credit card
so I can run it up.
That is literally
what is happening.
We're going to have
cheap debt long enough.
We're going to be able
to pay our debt
while I'm still alive.
But who's really
going to get fucked
is the kids
who are going to have
to pay it back
where I keep parting
on their debt.
Okay, so...
That was a lot.
No, it's...
The thing that I find...
Nobody can listen
to this podcast
at any faster
than actual speed
or slower.
I speak fast, right?
It's just too fast.
It was the wrong morning
to do meth.
Do you remember airplanes?
Like, oh,
I picked the wrong week
to quit drinking.
That's right.
To quit glue.
Yeah.
To quit sniffing glue.
Okay, so let's
back up a second here.
Sure.
I subscribe.
Yeah.
Hook, line, sinker.
Right?
I'm in.
Yeah.
But who will voluntarily
make those changes?
You just made the case
that the haves,
the status quo,
defend the status quo
because they benefit
from the status quo,
obviously.
Yeah, 100%.
And so there's no incentive
at all in business
or in politics
to change the tax code
and make the changes
that you're talking about.
There's no incentive
in a university system.
University presidents
aren't hired
to make great universities.
They're hired
to raise money.
Yep.
And so there's
no incentive whatsoever
to make the changes
that are common sense
and will work
that you're advocating.
Yep.
So short of revolution,
how do we make those changes?
Well, I don't think
it's that bad.
So I'll use myself
as an example
because what you're talking about,
people aren't going
to disarm unilaterally.
I've been very open.
I started my last speech
on saying I've been open
about my finances.
My average tax rate
the last 10 years
has been 17%
because some of the brightest
people I work with
help me minimize
my tax rate.
Probably the brightest woman
in my universe
is a woman who works
at a big law firm
and every year
she looks at my taxes
and she figures out
all kinds of legal ways
for me to reduce
my tax rate.
And I have the ability
to do that now
that I'm a super owner.
I've gone from super earner
to super owner.
What we need
is a group of people
and we've done this
in the past
that say we're going
to elect people.
No one's going
to disarm unilaterally.
You're going to try
and pay the minimum
amount of tax.
All right?
That's your job.
It's like being
a prisoner of war.
Your job is to escape.
All right?
So I'm not suggesting
anyone's going to say,
well, I'm just going
to write a bigger check
to the government
this year.
That's not going to happen.
But what we have done
and a lot of people
still do is I will vote
for people.
You know, I'll vote
for Senators Klobuchar
and Senators Bennett
and I'll try and get
Biden reelected
because I think
that those people
do think somewhat
long term
and will try,
will try
to impose
some of the things
we're talking about.
Hold on.
Let me interrupt here.
Sure.
Okay.
You don't buy it.
No.
Okay.
Go on.
So when you have wealth
Yep.
you get to say things
like, I'll vote
for the guy
that will make
the long term decisions.
Yep.
When you are
on the receiving end
of everything
you've talked about.
Yep.
Long term ain't a thing.
Mm-hmm.
Solving the problem,
finding a job,
reducing my tax rate,
managing inflation,
Mm-hmm.
affording milk,
Mm-hmm.
getting my kid
into school.
Yep.
not having to have
two jobs
to make
a single job wage.
Yep.
Um,
immediate relief
is the thing
I vote for.
And the promises
that some politicians
can make
about the immediate relief
that they will offer
is unbelievably appealing
whether it's true or not.
And you said it yourself,
that's the voting population.
The wealthy try to,
they use their money
to get what they want,
but the voting population,
the majority,
gets to actually vote.
Right.
But I do think,
so first off,
to your point,
the culprits are
the elected officials,
but the culpable
are voters.
If young people
want a greater transfer,
want to restore
opportunity to young people,
they need to start voting.
Instead of 40% of them
voting like seniors,
they need to be 60%.
Yeah.
In addition,
I think there's
an interesting idea
that you should be able
to vote for your kids.
We spend less money
per capita on children
than any developed nation.
And I think one quick fix
for that would be
to give people
who are the guardians
of kids more votes.
So you're a single mom
with three kids,
you get four votes.
I realize that's unlikely
to happen,
but that would immediately
overnight reshift
our priorities.
So I do think
there are things
absolutely we can do.
And I do think people
do vote for people
who they believe are,
look,
I hate to use the word term,
but it's leadership.
It's someone saying,
no one should have
to go bankrupt
after they find out
their wife has lung cancer.
So Obamacare,
expensive.
We all pay 2%
or 2.8% a year
in taxes
that we'd rather not pay
if you're healthy.
But Americans are saying,
look,
if a leader comes along
and convinces me
this is a reinvestment
in the middle class
and a reinvestment
in America,
I will vote for that person
if they can articulate
with passion and leadership.
I think that that opportunity
is still there.
You're touching right
on something
that's the thing
that I'm sort of
lamenting these days.
And it is that leadership
conversation,
which is it seems
that there's been
a total loss
of idealism.
I agree.
And you go back
to Ronald Reagan
or John F. Kennedy,
so I don't care
what your politics are.
They literally use
the terms peace on earth,
world peace
in their inaugurations
as a driving motivation,
which is an incredibly
appealing thing
to bring people together
and be willing
to bear any burden
and pay any price
for the greater good.
And talking about
world peace now,
literally in this
artificial context,
sounds completely cheesy
to say the world,
I'm doing it for world peace.
And I don't see it
in politics.
I don't even see it
in business.
The total loss
of idealism.
And I think idealism
is the thing
because idealism exists
on a level above
everything we're talking about.
It is the thing
that we can actually
see the forest
for the trees
and say,
well,
I am willing
to give up some
because I believe in that.
And some could be money.
It could be an effort.
It could be some sort
of sacrifice.
And so I wonder
if this is solvable
with good leadership.
Now,
I'm also not so foolhardy
to think,
oh,
well,
you just make leaders.
You know,
I actually think
that the single worst thing
that happened
to the United States
was the bankruptcy
of the Soviet Union
because it's very easy.
The problem with vision
and idealism
is it's ethereal.
It's ethereal.
You know,
it's literally
in someone's imagination.
They give a rousing speech
and like,
oh,
that sounds amazing.
And the great thing
about a common enemy
is they're tangible
and we can see it.
That's right.
And it's easy
to know what we stand for
when I can literally
see what I'm against,
what's the thing
that is preventing me
from getting this thing.
And I think there's
a very important nuance here,
which is the enemy
isn't the thing.
Having an enemy is easy
and we've seen it
throughout every dictatorship.
They find an enemy
and that's how
they come to power.
What they're missing
is the idealism.
The enemy isn't the enemy
so much as it is
the thing getting in the way
of us getting to the thing
that we want,
which is really important.
There's something
on the other side
of that.
And I blame every president,
by the way.
This is not a Republican,
Democrat thing.
The decline of idealism
from every president
who has served
since the fall
of the Soviet Union
has slowly chipped away
at American idealism
and that is gone.
That's a lot there.
So look.
And by the way,
we know the numbers,
which is we know
that belief and trust
in politicians
is at an all-time low.
We know that belief
and trust in,
there's no social leaders either.
We're the Martin Luther King Jrs.
They're not there, right?
The ones that are
bringing people together
rather than breaking us apart.
They're not there.
But trust in corporations,
weirdly,
is quite high right now.
And so I'm just going to go
where the market takes me.
And if that's where the trust is,
then I'm looking to
the corporate leaders
to start to demonstrate
the restoration of idealism.
And if they can start
to make the changes
that you and I are advocating
at a national level,
which, by the way,
it's not going to happen
like that, doesn't it?
But if they can start
making it at a corporate level,
small, mid-sized companies,
small companies,
even large companies,
start making the kinds
of social changes
that you and I
are talking about there,
it'll filter out
and eventually roll over
to politics.
The part where you lost me
is that we keep hoping
that the better angels
of CEOs are going to show up
and that if we paint iPods red,
the corporations
and capitalism will save us.
And I find that this entire notion
of corporate social responsibility
is just such unfettered bullshit.
But wait a minute.
I don't think of...
That's not what I'm talking about.
But let me...
Give me some running right here.
All right, okay.
And that is,
we keep hoping that
Sheryl Sandberg actually does care
about our children
and that Sam Altman
and his hushed tones
and concerns about AI
cares about anything
but making money.
Corporations are so great
at making money
and we need that
so we can generate tax revenue
and create economic security
for people.
They're so good at making money.
They shouldn't be trusted
to do anything else.
What we should do
is have a group of people
who sit on top
of that tax revenue
that hopefully grows
with the full-body contact
violence of capitalism,
which is a wonderful thing,
that tax them at a fair rate
and then redeploy that capital
based on a series of policies
that we all buy into.
I think that people
generally do believe
that we have a problem
when one in five households
in the most prosperous society
and nation
with children
are food insecure
that they would like
to see those problems solved
and if someone comes in
with an idea
and leadership
and says,
okay,
this is how we do it equitably,
this is the sacrifice
it's going to require,
are we going to cut spending
or increase taxes?
The answer is yes.
I do think there's opportunity
right now
for someone to come in
and say,
it's time to start
paying it forward,
it's time to return
to our American roots,
we have sacrificed
all the way through,
we've been harvesting
these sacrifices,
it's time to step
into the void
and pay it a little bit forward.
I do think there's
an opportunity here.
I'm more optimistic.
Americans,
if you think about it,
are an incredibly
generous people
and what's happened
is that,
I think,
because of no term limits,
because of the aging
of our elected representatives,
Nancy Pelosi,
when she had her first child,
Fidel had just
declared martial law
on Cuba,
only a third of houses
had color television,
so does she really understand
the challenges
facing a single mother?
I think we need
much,
much younger electorate,
but I think Americans
as a whole
are ready to sacrifice
as long as they feel
they're part
of a collective sacrifice,
and there really
hasn't been a voice
to kind of bring people
together and say,
unions,
you're going to hate me.
Old people,
you're going to hate me.
Corporations,
Jesus Christ,
you're going to hate me.
Young people,
all right,
I see the problem here.
I'm going to look.
Something I've struggled
with my whole life
is the difference
between being right
and being effective,
and as I talk
about these things
and try and foment
and catalyze social change,
I'm trying to be
more effective.
So, for example,
I'm trying to appeal
to people's sense
of reward
and masculinity,
for example,
and this is virtue signaling,
but I actually think
virtue signaling is fine.
I give away a lot of money,
and I don't do it
because I'm a good person.
I don't think I do it
because I'm philanthropic.
It makes me feel
really masculine.
I brag about it.
It makes me feel strong.
I believe it's bringing together
my skills and my strengths
to protect and provide
for others,
and it makes me feel
like a fucking baller.
So, I'm like,
why above a certain level,
and Daniel Kahneman,
one of my intellectual role models,
has this thing.
He proved
that the difference
between making $30,000
and $80,000 a year
or $30,000 and $50,000
is huge.
The difference
between making $1,000
and $3,000,000 a year,
no incremental happiness.
You're no happier.
So, wouldn't that argue
for a really progressive
tax structure
once above, say,
call it even $10,000,000?
You're going to get any happier
between $10,000 and $20,000,000 a year?
You're not.
I have science that shows it.
But if you can take that money
and then make a bunch
of households much happier
taking them from $30,000 to $50,000,
let's elect people
who are going to have
the backbone to say
nor to corporations
and special interest groups
and impose
a truly progressive tax structure.
And I think that argument
will resonate
with a lot of voters.
I do think that
D and democracy
can still work here.
And I think that
we are looking for a voice
and I think they're out there
to say,
look, it is time
to nod our head
to all the people
who have made
a ton of sacrifice
such that we could
reap the fruit we're reaping.
I think it's time.
I think America's ready for it.
All right.
You and I are giving each other
a lot of dense sandwiches
to unpack.
So the capitalism
that you're defending
or at least pointing to
that Sam Altman
who comes in
with these idealistic notions
and all of a sudden
they disappear
when money gets involved
is a relatively modern
conception of capitalism.
It's Milton Friedman's capitalism
popularized by fuckers
like Jack Welch.
Right.
But it's not
Adam Smith capitalism.
It's not the capitalism
that made America great.
Yeah, it's not true capitalism.
It's not true capitalism.
And so we've conflated
the bastardized version
of capitalism we have now
with the capitalism
that has contributed
to the world
for over 200 years.
And my fear is
that we're going to
throw the baby out
with the bathwater
because we've so conflated them.
And I think there should
be a return
to a kind of capitalism
where there is
I'll use the term
moral obligation.
That's right.
That we have moral obligation.
So just out of curiosity
I did this just the other day.
Just out of curiosity
I was curious
why rich people
gave to taxes
in like the Victorian era.
Right?
So 19th century.
Because the Carnegies
the Rockefellers
and the British wealthy
they gave shit tons
to charity
and they built
universities and hospitals
and all these wonderful
institutions that exist today.
And I was curious
that they did it
for tax incentive.
And in neither Britain
nor in the US
was there any tax incentive
a total of zero tax benefits
to give to charity.
And then I went and read
some of what they wrote
and what they said.
And they all used
the same terms.
They all used
the same term
which is moral obligation.
That we have a moral obligation
to give back
to the society
that gave to us.
Even if you could make
the argument
they were assholes
and not nice people
they believed
in this moral obligation.
And that moral obligation
came from God.
In other words
God was the thing
that was bigger
than all of them.
Whether they were God fearing
or not.
I'm not looking for religion
to solve the problem here.
But it's idealism.
It's the thing
that's bigger than all of us.
The fear of an existential
or something existential.
A comedy of man.
A comedy of man.
Yeah.
Somehow it restores
moral obligation.
And I don't think
any CEO
feels a moral obligation.
They talk about
fiduciary duty
which by the way
is lower than
a moral obligation.
They talk about
their fiduciary responsibilities.
And I think
that's why
business has become
so myopic
and to your point
which is the only thing
they're good at
is making money.
But I would like them
to have a moral obligation
and be good at making money.
See I think you're talking
your own book
because this is how
you make your living
is you go into corporations
and you teach them
or you try and convince them
to be more moral.
And I think that that is
I think that is
a noble thing
that we need more of.
I don't think
it's the right strategy.
Go on.
Tell me more.
Yeah go on.
Because they're always
going to figure out ways
why they get to their
next fucking Gulfstream.
And they'll wave their hands.
I go to these meetings
I'm in these boardrooms
and they all talk
a big fucking game
about social responsibility
and then they will
incrementally
do whatever is required
whether it's
put out media
that results in
more teenage girls
self-cutting
radicalizing young men
such that they can
while they finally
are in that CEO seat
that they work so hard
to get to
bank enough money
that they have influence
and have a much broader
selection set
of much hotter mates
than they deserve.
Those things are
irresistible.
That's what I want.
But those things
are irresistible
in different times.
Those things are not
a modern conception.
Those things have existed
literally since
there were people
had more than others.
If you're waiting
for the better angels
of CEOs to show up
don't hold your breath.
What we need
is a group of people
who convince enough people
to vote for them
to say okay.
But where are the candidates?
So you and I
are stuck in the same place.
Right.
Which is.
But you think CEOs
are going to fix this?
No I think the CEOs
at least
at least there's
an opportunity
in business
that I think
is more
more likely
to happen
in the short term
than the opportunity
in politics.
We need long term solutions.
Let me give you
one very tactical idea.
If we could go back
in time
would we put
a pretty immense tax
on all carbon capture
all carbon emission
and all oil
pulled out of the ground.
We knew that pulling
fossil fuels
out of the ground
and then arbing it
into a substance
to create economic value
was going to have
a lot of externalities.
So if we'd said
for every barrel
we pull out
we're putting
a $10 tax on it
and we're going
to start investing
in forward-leaning
investments around
the government
job training
and renewables.
We're at that moment.
The new energy
seven of the ten
most valuable firms
in 1980 were energy companies.
Seven of the ten
most valuable firms
in 2024
are tech companies
but they're not.
They're energy firms.
They're all becoming
the same firm
offering something
called compute
instead of powering
our cars
and our factories
they're powering
our phones
and our LLMs.
Which requires
a lot of power.
Right now
a query on chat GPT
takes ten times
the energy of Google.
Right now
is this an opportunity
to put in place
legislation
and have forward-leaning
and forward-thinking
politicians
who get enough support
and say
okay
we're going to tax compute.
We're going to tax compute
because we know
there are going to be
externalities
that will require money
around misinformation
around teen depression
around paying out
the deficit.
Everything you're saying
is correct.
Right.
Where are the people
who have the courage
to implement those things?
You're more cynical
than me.
The government
does pass
some positive things.
The CHIPS Act
the Infrastructure Act
there are some people
thinking long term.
Bob Iger
isn't going to save us
Simon.
No I don't think he is.
And Sam Altman?
But I'm not looking
to those guys
to fix it.
I'm looking
for the revolutionary CEOs
What Ben and Jerry's
or REI?
No.
Okay who?
Who's doing it?
Yeah exactly.
Exactly.
I think there's a group
Your power Simon
you are so articulate
and so forceful
is to rally
a group of people
to find elected officials
who are going to make
the hard decisions
to hold corporations
and they're super wealthy
and reinvest in America.
I'm not looking
to rally CEOs.
Right.
Fair enough.
Good.
Okay.
For every reason
you've articulated
because they
and by the way
I have the same
meetings with them
they spew the same
they tell me
what I want to hear
and then they go
and make the opposite
decisions.
No no I'm fully aware
of the idiocy.
Right.
And when I can
I'll call bullshit
but that's part of
what I think my job is
is to call bullshit.
Yep.
I'm rallying
the rest of us.
Yep.
You know
the voting population
Yep.
in business
is the workforce.
Yep.
And I believe
that power
is not
it's not a belief
it's a fact
that power
always exists
with the people.
The people always
have the power.
Agree.
Another quick idea
you didn't like
the compute idea.
No no
I love that idea.
Alright another one.
Why wouldn't we raise
minimum wage
to $25 an hour?
Well it'll put
all these small businesses
out of business.
No it doesn't.
The states that have
raised minimum wage
to $12 or $15 an hour
Washington state
and California
their economies have grown
because the wonderful
thing about poor people
is they spend
all their fucking money.
It creates
a multiplier effect.
And by the way
if minimum wage
had just kept pace
with inflation
or productivity
it'd be $23 an hour.
And by the way
McDonald's and Walmart
their stock would go down
and that's okay.
Corporate profits
are at an all time high.
Wages as a percentage
of GDP are at an
all time low.
Minimum wage
$25 federally mandated.
You and I agree.
Here's where we actually
agree that the power
is with the people.
Right.
You're saying
it's the voter
I'm saying
it's the employee.
And what I'm hoping
Fair enough.
What I'm hoping
is that
just like the voting
population gets involved
and gets educated
Yep.
I'm hoping that
the employee population
learns the skills
that they need to learn
Yep.
about idealism
and leadership
and moral obligation
Yep.
so that as they
make their own way
through the ranks
Yep.
that they will become
the leaders
that they wish they had.
I like that.
The manifestation
for that in the 20th century
is unions who are
corrupt and ineffective.
There should be one union.
All unions have been
totally ineffective.
45 of the 47 nations
that have unions
have lost union membership.
Union membership
in the United States
has been cut in half.
There should be one union.
It should be in Washington, D.C.
and it should be
federally mandated
minimum wage
of $25 an hour
and get rid of
all the corrupt
corruption
and weirdness
and inefficiency
that is unions.
Everything we're talking about.
Yep.
Usually if you go
to a company
with a good leader
Yep.
what the federally mandated
minimum wage is
is irrelevant.
Right.
Because good leaders
will say
my people can't live
on that wage
I'm going to pay them fairly.
Okay.
Right.
And those good leaders
are usually
in information economy companies
that can afford
to pay their people
$25 an hour.
Unless all fast food companies
are forced to pay
$25 an hour
the temptation
to pay them $11 an hour
will be too great.
They won't.
Yeah.
I think that you and I
have gone in a full circle here
because all we have advocated
is revolution.
No, no, no.
But I don't think
it has to be
a violent revolution.
Yeah.
But what we're advocating
is revolution.
There's an opportunity
and I think they're out there
for a younger person
to come in
and say
it is time to pay it forward folks.
I'm going to literally
piss off every special interest group
but I need your vote.
It's funny
because we're kind of saying
the exact same thing
which is we're looking
for people
to say
what the solutions are
and ask
vote for me
or support me
whether at work
or in office
to do the right thing.
I agree with you.
The problem is
once they get the power
and once they get the money
the same thing happens.
There's like
congressmen that I've met
when their first terms
or when they're running
for the first time
my God
they really are idealistic.
Then once they get there
and they sniff the power
and they recognize
that their job
is fundraising
the idealism
falls away.
There's some good people.
I'm not throwing
Ro Khanna,
Senators Warner,
Klobuchar, Bennett.
By the way
on both sides of the aisle
on both sides of the aisle
there's
fewer and fewer
on the right to be blunt.
Fewer and fewer.
Ratios aren't the same.
James Carville said
and I think he's 100% right
when he said it then
and I think it's 100% true now
which is the difference
between Republicans and Democrats
as Republicans want to win
and Democrats want to be right.
Well the difference
between being right and effective
and also just to
give equal opportunity
the far left
has become
incredibly naive
and incredibly anti-American
and incredibly
in my opinion
racist.
I think there's
look
the biggest threat
in the world
is not a pandemic.
It's not Putin.
It's not Hamas.
It's extremism.
And if you look
at the far left
and the far right
they seem to have
all come together
to agree on anti-Semitism.
I mean
we have decided
to elect people
who are extremists
and because of
gerrymandering
and hard right
and hard left
districts
we send
people who are just
fucking crazy
on the left
and people who are
fucking crazy
on the right
and we're supposed
to govern that way.
We have minority rule.
80% of our senators
are from 20%
of the population.
The vast majority
of Americans
are in the middle.
The vast majority
of Americans
think okay
we need corporations
to be successful
but they should
pay their fair share.
Okay women
should have
bodily autonomy.
Should a woman
be able to have
a pregnancy
in the third term
without threat
to their life?
Probably not
but that never happens.
Let's have an honest
conversation.
Do we need
three sets of bathrooms
in every corporation?
Probably not
but for God's sake
stop demonizing
these people
who make up
the total population
of lacrosse players
in Wisconsin.
Why the fuck
are we demonizing?
Most people
are somewhere
in the middle.
The middle.
And those people
have absolutely
no representation
because social media
says the following.
Okay you need
two things
to survive as a species.
You have to enjoy sex.
We still have that
and you need to be able
to get enjoyment
in a rush
from collectively
pulling together
and you referenced
this earlier
to defeat a common enemy
whether it's either
there's no more deer here
we need to move on
or there's people
over the hill
that want to kill us
so we come together
to kill them.
You've got to get
a rush from that.
And in order to have
that rush
you need to find
an enemy.
And unfortunately
because as you said
we're no longer
in a cold war
well we need an enemy.
Well I know
let's turn our neighbors
into enemies.
40% fewer people
are speaking
to their neighbors
right now.
52% of Democrats
are worried
their kids
are going to marry
a Republican.
We're not each other's enemies
we're fucking Americans.
We're each other's allies
for Christ's sake.
But instead
let's find algorithms
that pit us
against each other.
Let's find politicians
that are more interested
in making the other side
look stupid
for their YouTube moment
than actually coming together
to actually fucking govern.
Enough already.
Let's find people
in the middle.
And by the way
I'm sure it happens to you
it happens to me.
You know what
they all agree on?
We should hate moderates.
This is what I get
from the political spectrum.
The far right
calls me a libtard
and occasionally
when I talk about
the importance
of having a strong military
or the taxes
are too high
on the super earners
the far left
feel like
oh my god
we thought we could
trust you.
You have betrayed us.
There is absolutely
no room anymore
for anyone in the middle.
And unless people
start speaking up
and going
you know what
this doesn't make
for good TikTok
but it probably represents
how most people think
and we need to have
a thoughtful opinion.
We need fewer ideologues
and more pragmatists.
But there is such
a white space right now
for a new generation
of leadership
to come in and say
okay I'm somewhere
in the middle.
I'm never going to
personally attack
anyone on the other side.
That's not why I'm here.
I'm here to get
legislation done.
There's some obvious
things we need
to restore here.
Income inequality
is out of control.
We need an exceptionally
strong defense.
We need to stop
spending $7 trillion
a year and only
taking in $5 trillion.
We need to stop
this bullshit
transfer of wealth
from the entrance
to the incumbents.
Come on.
Let's grow up.
It's time.
The opportunity is huge.
Someone is going to
step into that void.
You and I are founding
a new political party
called the common sensists.
The normies?
The normies.
The common sensists.
I am hopeful
because
and here's what gives me hope.
You and I
shouldn't have careers.
I definitely shouldn't
have a career.
I talk about
trust and optimism.
That's such bullshit.
You have the core
competence of success.
You know what that is?
What's that?
Storytelling.
You know how to tell stories.
But I talk about
my stories are about
trust and cooperation
and there should be
no demand for my work.
You don't believe that.
I do.
Yeah.
If I had said
if any of my books
were written
and anything that I've said
in 19...
If you're living in Russia
talking about the patriarchy
or all of the oligarchy
you'd make a shit ton of money.
If I had written anything
that I wrote
or said anything
that I said
in the 1980s
there would be no one.
But you would have
found something else.
No.
But the point is
this is what I believe
and my beliefs
would have zero resonance
in the 1980s.
Okay.
I get that.
The times are right
for what we're talking about
and there is demand
for the stuff
that you and I
are talking about.
There is demand
for people
who are looking
to belong to something
and society
isn't providing
the bowling leagues
and the religious institutions
aren't providing it.
that people are looking
they've focused on money
they did as they were told
and focused on me
and focused on money
and focused on advancement
and they haven't found
the happiness and joy
that they've been looking for
and so they're looking
somewhere else
and they're looking
in weird places
and weird spiritual things
and what if I do
ayahuasca every weekend
you know
it's like
it's like
it was said
that a glass of wine
a day
is good for you
that means
the very American way
will have a glass of wine
a day is good for you
that a bottle of wine
a day must be great for you.
So quick stat
just I'm probably interrupting
there's a statistic
showing that far right families
are better at parenting
than far left
which upset me
because I'm far left
because of what you're
talking about
far right families
are more likely
to inject institutions
into the kid's life
religious institutions
boy scouts
what you're saying
is the importance
of institutions
the importance of institutions
the importance of
collective
of collective
and the importance
of friends
this is the thing
that I'm sort of
working on
and writing about now
which is
you know
there's an entire
industry to help us
be better leaders
there's an entire industry
to give us advice
how to be better parents
there's an entire industry
how we can be healthy
how we can eat right
how we can manage
our glucose
how we can live longer
and how we can exercise
and there's absolutely
nothing to teach us
how to be better friends
and none of those
other things will be there
in a time of need
like your boss
isn't going to be there
for you
and by the way
learning to be a better boss
doesn't make you
a better parent
learning to be a better friend
makes you a better parent
makes you a better boss
makes you a better everything
yeah
that thing that's lubricated
friendship for me
is alcohol
by the way
one in seven
which is why you and I
aren't friends
because I won't
drink to excess with you
don't say that
that hurts my feelings
you said to me
the last time I saw you
that you couldn't be my friend
because I won't go out
and get drunk with you
no it means we couldn't have sex
I don't think I've ever had sex
I didn't get fucked up first
we should probably edit that out
by the way
for all young people listening
my advice to you
is go out
drink too much
and make a series of bad decisions
that might pay off
that's not my career experience
just so you know
yeah
but there was
one in seven men
I'm trying to find a segue
out of this
one in seven men
don't have a single friend
one in four men
can't name a best friend
I agree with you
I'd like to see something
called the friendship project
I'm trying to be more promiscuous
for saying yes to stuff
to
I'm at a point
where I'm looking to shed friends
not gain them
but I'm trying to be better about it
and something I'm trying to instill
in my boys
is I ask them to speak to a stranger
when they're out
because I'm worried
that being on the phone
that they've slowly but surely
become introverts
that aren't investing in other people
are they good at playing with each other
like they're playing together
you know they're brothers
so
do you have siblings
I have a younger sister
they're
so you hope as parents
that they're going to be
best friends
and they're not
you know the younger one's
obsessed with the older one
lashes out to get his attention
the older one's into other things
and kind of
what are their ages
they're 13 and 16
yeah
so our vision for what
we'd hope they would be
I mean I hope
I hope it grows into
a great friendship
but right now
they're more competitors
than friends
it's actually sort of
heartbreaking
but it's
but it's an age
that makes sense
yeah I get it
I get it
but we'd still rather
yeah
they were looking out
for each other
a little bit more
but anyways
by the way
that was
I think that's my biggest regret
is not having more kids
but I don't know
how I got on this
anyways
you were trying to segue
out of the other thing
about the alcohol
and having
it's like my parents
I asked them
if I was an accident
they said no
it was a tragedy
anyways
where are we Simon
bring us back
so
it goes
the irony is
of all of these
social challenges
that we're facing
yeah
and the decline
of the empire
you know
which is
declines of empires
are acts of suicide
always
you know
the thing
that we're watching
play out in front of us
that perhaps
just perhaps
this very very
old fashioned thing
called
I care and love
the people next to me
might actually be
the solution
because
I want to do
the right thing
not for myself
but for the people
I love
and you know
like
I spent time
with Navy SEALs
and other
very high performing
military
special operators
and what they all
have in common
is
that they care
for each other
more than others
are capable of
and that they don't
have this raw courage
I think that's the
definition of love
they don't have
this raw courage
it's that they fear
letting each other down
more than they fear
dying
and
it's all about
the guy next to you
it's all about
the guy next to them
and I think
very few of us
you know
I remember the first time
a friend of mine
in uniforms
called me
brother
because you and I
have colleagues
and co-workers
they have brothers
and sisters
and I remember
the first time
somebody called me
brother
that it meant something
and I also
as a friend of mine
who's a
he's a warrior
make no mistake
of it
he's a warrior
he's a war hero
he's risked his life
to save others
he's still in uniform
and I remember
we had a long conversation
one evening
just catching up
as friends
and at the end
of the conversation
before he got off
the phone
he said
I love you
not love ya
not love you
I love you
and
men don't say that
to each other
for sure
and
I remember
what it felt like
I'm feeling it now
and I
it struck me so hard
that I started
experimenting
saying that
to the people
who I feel that way
about
and I have some friends
who are
I would call them
not warm
good people
kind people
not warm people
but I love them
and I remember
I'm thinking of two people
in particular
and I remember
saying to them
I love ya
when I was leaving
to say goodbye
and I remember
how struck
they were
and then
in very short time
they started
saying it back
and in very short time
they started
hugging me
like they'd never
hugged me before
and these are old
friendships
and when we talk
about World War II
and the willingness
to
the intense desire
to serve
I think it's because
we knew our
you said it before
we knew our neighbors
we barbecued
with our neighbors
we cared about
our friends
we went to church
we went to bowling league
we went to PTA meetings
we took each other's
kids to school
and dare I say
this very old fashioned
very very human thing
called love thy neighbor
love thy friend
might actually be
the solution
we're looking for
that all the other things
that you and I
have spent way too long
talking about
might actually be symptoms
rather than
the causes themselves
so I like that
I think that's part of it
but you know how I say
I love you to people now
I give them money
that's not love
oh it's better
the kids who work for me
don't want my love
they want money
your friends
I'm not talking about
your employees
I'm not talking about
your employees
okay but that's how
I make the biggest impact
I have a group of friends
we share affection
with each other
I'm seeing like
three fraternity brothers
in Aspen in two weeks
I invite my friends
to a bunch of shit
I think they feel loved
I know they love me
but that's generous
but in terms of
moving society forward
here's how I was
the first four years
of my life
anyone that walked
into one of my companies
had two bubbles
one bubble was
how much money they made
one bubble was
how much value
they were adding
and if the left bubble
got bigger than the right
I warned them
and if it didn't get fixed fast
I fired them
I was a pure
under dollar rate capitalist
and now you know what I do
I overpay people
my job
as someone who has
a lot of money
is to stuff
as much money
into the pockets
of people who are
working with me
who do a great job
it's almost like
a self-imposed
wonderful
I love that
keep doing it
great
love it
okay
but your friends
that you're generous with
and you'll pay for the trip
and you'll pay for the hotels
I'm not talking about that
like I'm talking about
like let's take two scenarios
right
a friend of yours
is moving house
yep
and you go
you're such a great friend
I'm paying for the moving van
here's five grand
right
yeah
you wanted to go over
and actually help him move
right
and versus the friend
no fucking way
no fucking way
okay
so
I'll be getting drunk
with someone
or I'll be at the hotel du Cap
but by the way
here's the money
no need to thank me
I got it
money is the transfer
of work and time
it is the best way
to express love
but it's a redeemable commodity
it's a redeemable commodity
oh and it's such an awesome commodity
in a capitalism society
but it's redeemable
you cannot redeem
ask the people who work for you
do they want a fucking hug
or do they want a bonus
give them a bonus bitch
you keep conflating
give them a bonus bitch
you keep conflating employees
and friends
well okay family
every time I'm talking about friends
family
you keep going back to
people who work for you
who work for me
you're the guy lecturing CEOs
turn them into your family
isn't that what they called
we're a family
okay treat them like family
give them money
I'm talking about
the people you love in your life
that you will learn
moral obligation
and you keep going back
we should so be drinking right now
you keep talking about employees
we should so be drinking
I think we need to lie you down
on a couch here
and you need to tell me
about your childhood
why you can't talk about
friends and loving friends
and you keep wanting
to talk about capitalism
and paying employees
it's not either or
it's yes
it's yes
I got that part down
I got the love part down
they're two different things
and you can only talk about
one of them
but they're not mutually exclusive
what do we need more of
people telling each other
they love each other
or stepping more money
into their pockets
so they can
so they can have their own house
yes we need both those things
so they can vacation
where Simon vacations
we need both those things
but you are only all
talking about one
I'm trying to get you
to talk about the other
okay
I agree with you
I'm there
the love thing is great
I have an idea
the love things are great
I have an idea
I don't think we suffer
from an absence
well okay
the coarseness
of our discourse
has gotten too coarse
I agree with you
take the temperature down
the greatest unused commodity
in history
is good intentions
men have a difficult time
expressing their emotions
it's great to say
I respect you
I think you're an interesting guy
I think you're handsome
given your age Simon
it's
these are things
you don't have to say
I love you
we don't have that friendship
it's fine
it's not going to happen
I don't expect it to be weird
if you say that
I respect you
but I do think that
for guys in my position
I think the way
I can add the most value
is to really
I'll give you an example
I hit my number
10 years ago
I don't understand
I'm totally optimized
for happiness right now
I got a third of my life left
chronologically
but I'm going to live
four thirds of it
spiritually
and psychologically
I'm just going to have
a fucking
I'm going to squeeze
so much juice out of this
ellipsoid lemon
called terra
called earth
and I figured out
the way I can be happiest
is to get rich
I got there
that's really important to me
it's wonderful
in a capitalist society
it means I get to live
a better life
I get to be loved
to be rich in America
is to be loved
full stop
it's a violent
rapacious place
if you don't have money
it's a loving
generous place
if you do have money
once you hit your number
and I would like to start
a movement here
there's no reason
to be a hoarder
because this is what
makes you happy
spend it
I spend so much
fucking money
and it's amazing
and then you know
what I do
I give it away
I have not increased
my net worth
in seven years
I look at my number
once I got there
ten years ago
last seven years
I look at my number
and if my wealth
has gone up x
and I haven't spent it all
I give it away
and you know what
it makes me feel
strong like bull
I want to beat
my fucking chest
it feels so good
and so what I would say
to anyone else
who has a lot of money
why do you need
to be a billionaire
it's not going to
get you anything
here's what you do
you go to the hotel
ducap with your wife
you do amazing things
with friends and family
you take care of your parents
you fly your friends
to Aspen to hang out with you
and then anything above that
you give it away
and there's so many
amazing causes
and people
and overpay the people
who work with you
throw money around
like you're a fucking
gangster in the 50s
diagnosed with ass cancer
just live it up
and you know what
you're going to love life
don't do it
because you're noble
don't do it
because you're praying
to some god
or whatever it is
I can tell you
first hand
it feels amazing
so I'm trying to appeal
to people's
selfish instincts
you want to have
an amazing life
get rich
economic security
is important
especially for a man
and I know that
sounds sexist
but assume you are
going to take
economic responsibility
for your household
which sometimes
means getting out
of the way
and letting your wife
because she's better
at the money thing
and then once you
get your number
once you get your number
spend it
or give it away
I was so trying
to wrap this up
and end this
and you had to go
and open a fucking
Pandora's box for me
now
I can't just let that go
okay
okay
you're missing
one vital element
from that rent
okay
at what cost
right
at what cost
and in other words
that's what's been
happening for the past
30 or 40 years
you mean I don't get
a second plane
because I'm giving
my money away
no
I'd like a bigger
plane Simon
I want the Gulfstream
meaning people are
pushing so hard
to make their number
yeah
the cost is too steep
it's at the cost
of each other
it's at the cost
of society
it's at the cost
of our employees
it's like
I'm going to
lay off
all these people
so that I can
make my number
I'm going to stab
you in the back
so that I can
make my number
your rant
needs a little bit
of a hedge
that's not true
because the rant
that you're giving
is the new capitalist
1980s Jack Welch rant
you're falling
into a populist myth
that rich people
call over other people
to get there
the majority of rich
people are good people
if you want to be
really wealthy
it's a full person
project
you're the one
who said
that there's no
the CEOs
that I'm living
with rose-colored glasses
because the CEO
is ignoring me
because of
you know
they're doing a good job
they're supposed to
we should have
higher taxes on them
but generally speaking
they're good people
I know yes
some of them
are our friends
some of them
I don't like
the majority
of successful people
have one thing in common
and that is
one they work out
that's the thing
that's most common
physical fitness
is really important
you need to walk
into a room
and be able to either
if shit gets real
either kill and eat
everybody
on them
I believe that
and two
they're generally
put in a room
of opportunities
even when they're not there
because they're
high character people
so the cartoon
of Monty Burns
lighting his cigars
with $100 bills
that really isn't accurate
but I
at the same time
they need to pay
more than taxes
they need to pay
their fair share
they can't be
incentivized to lay off
people and invest money
in artificial intelligence
it's tax policy
it's incentives
at the risk of this
becoming yet another
one of your podcasts
there you go
that you know
Scott's announcing
another podcast
that he's doing
it's now with me
there you go
how many podcasts
do you have now
four
to resist is futile
I'm like AOL
in the 90s
you stick your hand
in a cereal box
and you pull out
a disc of the dog
I'm everywhere
I'm literally
it's like every time
I turn on
any kind of social media
to resist is futile
Scott Galloway
has yet another
podcast that he's doing
give in
do you just spend
eight hours a day
like one podcast
or the other
here's the unknown secret
I work
30 hours a week max
greatness is in the
agency of others
I have 14 people
that I pay really well
and I think overpay
they would argue
and they do an amazing job
you have the same thing
I've met your team
you have really good people
people think it's us
in our kitchen
with a camcorder
sketching out shit
and they don't realize
no the key to success
is like I said
greatness in the agency
of others
is finding and retaining
really good people
and it's easier
when you pay them
really well
and the lesson I learned
a long long long time ago
when I had that
thought completely backwards
when I started my business
thinking that I had to be
the one that had
all the answers
was learning to ask for help
and accepting
when it was offered
I think that's right
yeah I still struggle
with that
but yeah I agree
on that note
on me agreeing with you
Simon Sinek
we agree on more
than you think
by the way
I made fun of
I made fun of Simon
in my TED talk
I said that
I was the bastard
love child
was a Brazilian novella
where Bill Gates
and Malcolm Gladwell
had a night of wild sex
and gave birth
to their bastard
love child
Simon Sinek
and literally
the crowd went crazy
for that
that was actually
I think
it was a picture
of a baby
with your face on
I knew you would love it
I think it was
the biggest laugh you got
it was
oh wait
and the picture
of Bezos
with his new wife
that got a lot of
that got a lot of laughs
that got a lot of laughs
Simon
Scott
I don't love you
but I like you
I like you a lot
I like you Simon
I like you a lot
I respect you
a great deal
