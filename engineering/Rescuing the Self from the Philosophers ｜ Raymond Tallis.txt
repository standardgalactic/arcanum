Oh well good afternoon as it is here in the UK to the MindBodySolutions and to you the audience
and to you Tev for kindly inviting me to talk about the self and indeed about rescuing the
self from the philosophers because the self's had a bit of a rough time at the hands of philosophers
so I want to do a bit of affirmative action for the self and the aim of my talk is to make more
visible and then to explore key aspects of us of the mysterious creatures we are given to ourselves
to be and actually the more I think about the self the stranger I seem and I do seem very strange to
myself at times and it's actually also rather strange to be talking as I am you have an instance
of one stealth talking to other selves reassuring or trying I hope to reassure them that they exist
what a strange thing to do but what I want is to see what remains of the self after you set aside
or deny yourself the use of terms such as spirit soul or ghost restore what I call the humiliated
self apologies for the pun the explanation will come shortly restore the humiliated self to the
point where it can be a person can be the bearer of biography and most importantly a moral agent
I want to another pun coming up to exhume the self here's a man my first witness have I called him
Mr McBundle he's a Scot hence the muck but he also supports so-called bundle theory of the self and he
really is possibly my most important target in this talk why well this is what he had to say about the self
I won't try a Scottish accent but this is what he said I may venture to affirm that selves that is
are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed each other with inconceivable
rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement hence the bundle theory of the self
self how does he arrive at this conclusion well by the honorable uh process of empirical observation
he says there are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call
ourself but for my part when I enter most intimately into what I call myself I always stumble on some
particular perception or other of heat or cold light or shade love or hatred pain or pleasure I can
never catch myself at any time without a perception and can never observe but the perception can observe
only the perception
so the self seems to evaporate before his very gaze that he was writing in the 1730s his treatise on human
nature but autocide or being an autocide has remained one particular strand of philosophy and it's
particularly popular at the moment and I just mentioned three leading figures who've talked about the self
in the 21st century Galen Strawson he or who offers us the pearl necklace self Daniel Dennett who offers the
narrative center of gravity of self and Thomas Metzinger who beats the other two and talks about the no one self
so let's talk about Galen Strawson this man who doesn't think he has much in the way of a self
he says we don't have a self we just have loads of selves many selves exist not simultaneously but one after the other
like pearls on a string yes there is a mental self but only at a given moment of consciousness
and in humans it exists for a short period of time just a few seconds so that's the pearl necklace self
then there's Daniel Dennett who thinks of the self as an imaginary construct
imaginary construct like the notion of the center of gravity and you may recall that a center of gravity
as Dennett explains isn't anything isn't a thing it's not an atom or a subatomic particle or any other
physical item in the world it has no mass it has no color it has no physical properties at all except for
spatial temporal location it is a purely abstract object it is he says if you like a theorist fiction
it's not one of the real things in the universe in addition to the atoms likewise the self isn't
anything additional to the stories we tell about ourselves and then finally there's Thomas Metzinger
no one he said ever was or had a self so he's clearly the man who is no one all that ever existed
were conscious self models that could not be recognized as models they're just models but we
don't recognize their models they're things effectively reconstruct the phenomenal self is not
a thing but a process so he's a bit like Hume he's a bit like Galen Strawson
seeing that the self is just a succession of mental contents if you like and that's from being
no one the self model theory of subjectivity a book of several hundred pages which in my opinion
probably took a self to write but that's something we need to argue about so let's get back to mr bundle
mr muck bundle just remember that passage we had just before and you realize it's riddled with self
contradictions he is an eye who is denying the eye so what does he say in that packet passage i enter
most intimately into what i call myself and when i do i always stumble on some particular perception
i can never catch myself at any time without a perception and i can never observe but the perception
one two three four five times but actually it's four times i is explicitly mobilized and once implicitly
mobilized so we have an eye who denies he's a self who denies anything corresponding much
into the eye example of what philosophers call pragmatic self-contradiction
we have to ask ourselves could a bundle of sensations gather itself in the way that
hume gathered himself into an object of a report on itself in the way that he reports on himself
indeed could a bundle of sensations conclude that it is a bundle of sensations
and the answer to question a is no and the answer to question b is no again because it takes an awful
lot of self to deny that you have a self and to be able to give and indeed to share reasons for doing
so using by the way words that have rather complex meanings so it's obvious there's more much more to mr
hume's self than what is revealed to him by introspection than the bundle of sensations
that he picks out when he thinks about himself
it seems as if basically
it's a slam dunk you know clearly all of those characters strawson dennett metzinger hume
are all contradicting themselves by denying they have selves so why do we bother with hume and indeed
the post-human autocides well actually they're quite useful wrong ideas in philosophy are often very useful
because by contrast they enable you perhaps to see the right ideas certainly these characters seem to
create a standpoint from which is possible by default to see what the self actually is
most importantly it helps to make visible the rich mystery of the self as something
that is impossible to dissolve in the natural material world
and what we if we're going to rescue the self we need to think a little bit harder about it we need to
look a little bit harder at it not in the way that hume did but in different ways the road to rescuing
the self is observing its deeply connected multiplicity which goes way beyond the multiplicity
the connected multiplicity of pearls on a string
so what sort of sources of coherence does the self have well there is internal coherence
unity at a time i'll say something about that there's unity over time which is another dimension
of internal coherence there is the coherence of those standing states of ourselves and i'll give
an example of a few and then there's the external coherence the social scaffolding of the self
and then there's the body and the body is obvious source of both external and internal coherence of
the self but i've got to be a little careful here because some people would like to reduce the self
and the continuity of the self to the body and the continuity of the body and that would be
very disappointing indeed and then there's of course our sense of ourselves as agents
so let's talk about the internal unity of the self at a given time
the multiplicity and unity of the conscious moment think how sensations and perceptions from one
modality add up to a field i can look out the window at the moment i look past the daffodils
i look at the trees i see the sky see a bird flying across all of those belong to a unity i don't just
see them in succession they are co-present that co-present goes beyond a single modality of sensation
there is what we might call the cross-modal unity of sensations and perceptions where we feel
there belongs to a single moment of consciousness not only things we see but also things we hear
i'm looking out the window seeing the landscape i've described i can hear my voice speaking i can
feel my hands waving through the air i can feel my bum on the seat all of those things are all gathered
together in a single moment of consciousness and there is a unity of what we might call transitive
and intransitive experiences a transitive experience is an experience of something that is over there
from my experience of the tree i can see through the window intransitive experiences are experiences that
are not about something other than themselves like itches or indeed the pressure that i feel
as i'm sitting on a chair so there's that unified as well and of course there is the unity of my body
in its bodily self presence i don't feel i'm a little patchwork of patches i feel as if i'm a single
unified body so the pressure on of the carpet on my feet and the feeling of the saliva in my mouth
all belong to a unity so we have this multiplicity yes but a unified multiplicity of the conscious moment
and of course there's more going on than the sort of things i've talked about and i could go on at
length but i'll just simply list them emotions thoughts memories they all have a common ownership
or at least an implicit point of attachment so that's unity at a time and of course there's
unity over time and that's something that many philosophers have focused on the explicit unity
of the self over time there is working experiential memory there's declarative and procedural memory
declarative memory say memory for facts and procedural memory for memory of how to do things there's
semantic memory again of memory for facts there's episodic memory when i can remember something that
happened or autobiographical memory when i remember that something happened to me and the most exciting
form of memory is what floss of the psychologists would call auto noetic memory this is a memory
that i recall and i recall that is of something that happened to me i attach it to myself
let me say a little bit more about auto noetic memory because it puts my selfhood in italics in
the way perhaps the other forms of memory don't when i have such a memory i locate the memory in a self
that is myself and was myself and in a world that is and was my world i locate the remembered event in
my life i was there so if i just think about something quite banal like having lunch two hours ago i can
recall myself sitting there and the person who's sitting there at that table having those experiences
is the same person as the person who's now hearing himself talking to you
and in fact auto noetic memory has triple intentionality now intentionality is the property
of aboutness of experiences but when i have an auto noetic memory i have the original experience of the
events the experience i had when i'm sitting down to eat then there's my memory of that experience such
as i'm having now and then my locating that memory in a past self or a past world that's an awful lot
of tethering together of myself over time now john locke was very impressed by the role of memory
in as it were the nature the essence the coherence of the self the trouble is as he admitted this
continuity continuity of memory seemed a vulnerable basis oneself one forgets things in fact he even
felt that the self was limited by forgetfulness if for example i performed a crime 25 years ago
and now i've completely forgotten it he could say we could no longer be held responsible for it
rather convenient you might think but the truth is i can forget what i did and yet it's still i who did it
and thomas reed gives a very interesting counter example he thinks about a young lad who steals some
apples from an orchard and gets beaten as they would do in those days for this act of theft now that young
lad can be remembered by a young officer who is extremely brave in a particular battle that he took
place in uh it took part in i beg your pardon 20 years later so you can see there's a link between
those two phases of that person's life and then there is the old man who's reminiscing in his chair
remembering the battle he participated in when he was a young man but he can't remember his getting beaten
for stealing the apples from north from from the orchard but there's nonetheless a kind of continuity
because a is linked with b and b is linked with c so there's a transitivity between let's say the
original experience and the later experience the written experience of the young boy and the later
experience of the old man and a philosopher writing largely towards the end of the 20th century grice
felt this was very much a clue to our nature as being selves he believed in overlap and he put it rather
technically he said each total temporary state of herself me at this moment contains an element
a remembered experience shared by the preceding total temporary state say me an hour before but this
one won't be true of the total temporary state of different selves so i remember i will remember my
memories but you won't remember my memories so that differentiates us oh there we go and he felt that
basically it was that continuity through overlapping threads that secured our um continuity unity as a
self in other words he picked up on what thomas reed said and said yes of course the old man is the
same as the young boy because the old man remembers the brave soldier who in turn remembers the young
boy he once was so we get a continuity through overlap overlapping threads i don't find that totally
reassuring because am i as an old man really a load of old or aging rope it sounds a bit too bundly for
me and what's more that which overlaps in me reaches past the point of overlap there are backwards and
forwards connectedness there is co-presence of now and then in implicit and explicit sense and what's more
there are countless dimensions and scales of familiarity the self at any given time as i say
is flattened by its connected world so it's more than just overlapping threads adding up to a rope
i'm not an old you know a load of old or aging rope and one of the things we need to appreciate is
that there is kind of implicit temporal depth at any moment and its connectedness which makes sense of
experiences in the light of other experiences if i didn't have other experiences that were illuminating
what i'm doing now i'd have no idea what i'm up to or indeed why i'm up to it
so our continuity is not a question of connecting successive states slights or contents slices or
contents it's not merely just overlap between them it goes beyond discrete and explicit memories
raymond tallis at time t100 is informed and his life is facilitated by raymond tallis at time t1 to t100
the sense that i and my world make to myself at any given time draws on the past and also on a future
that draws on that past as well behind every moment of making sense of myself is what you might call the
sense light of prior moments and the individual indeed communal circumstances which those prior moments lived
suffered and indeed embraced there is internal transillumination which goes beyond mere overlap
of a threads of threads of memory so making sense of my being up on a kind of stage to you now
draws on a vast ocean of my past that's not past not entirely past but present though much of it is
implicit ditto your being here nailed to your seats as you listen to this talk so explicit unity over time
goes beyond mere memory there is a kind of ownership of one's past there's also an ethical issue there's
the owning up to one's past going back to lock basically he seemed to think if you forgot a crime you
committed then somehow it wasn't part of you but if it could be demonstrated that you'd actually
perform that crime then i think we ought one ought to own up to it and that applies equally to mistakes
as a medics we often preoccupy by our mistakes and they're just as real now as they were when they were
made and also on the other side achievements so there we have it's getting rather complicated
isn't it there's an internal connectedness unity at a time internal connectedness in the form of unity
over time but we haven't finished with the internal connectedness yet they're what you might call
standing states these are habits capabilities standing goals standing objectives the period
over years where you decide you're going to be a medic and follow a medical career etc etc
there are dispositions that are standing states and trays which others will recognize as well as oneself
we also have we take from moment to moment from epoch to epoch
a body of factual knowledge things that i learned when i was 16 they're still part of my body of
knowledge now even though i feel that the learning curve i'm on at the moment is pointing downwards
rather than upwards but that's another story there are beliefs that are not merely as it were received
passively they're embraced affirmed enacted there are long-standing projects dreams values commitments
and very importantly relationships with others so these are standing states versus a current states
and they add to our unity over time there is for example the deliberate acquisition of skills expressed
as muscle memory performance ability to each other i'm connected if i become world famous pianist i'm
connected with the four-year-old who first encountered a piano and then spent many many hours perfecting the
ability to play music on the piano this is the exercise of those acquired skills which enables us to be the
beneficiaries of past labors personality which we may cultivate which we may affect which we certainly act out
so there we are a pile of standing states also stitching us together over time so they're the internal
sources of our coherence that makes us much more than pearls on a string or just a trickle of perceptions
what about external support the so-called social scaffolding of the self
our central thesis is it takes a village indeed a global village to raise and sustain a self but this
doesn't mean however we dissolve into a community of minds and i'll come back to that in due course
but our social scaffolding lies in our roles our rights our duties profess beliefs that we explicitly
share with others profess convictions commitments relationship to institutions the hospital i worked in
for 20 30 odd years and indeed work is central to our continuing identity
nietzsche described man as the promising animal it didn't mean that we were full of promise what it
meant was we made promises and that is where we commit our future so i'm going to say to tev yes i'm very
happy to give a talk in three or four weeks time that is another way in which through the external
scattering of involving involvement with others i am stitched together myself that fortnight or a
year's time or whatever is part of my sustained explicit extended continuity
we are creatures who are answerable for our own future and indeed behind promises is the strongest
sense of the reality and continuity of the self promises not merely for events but also the kind of
promises we make when we say we get married or we qualify as a doctor or whatever
appointments are very interesting the more i think about them the more interesting they become
we basically commit ourselves to an event which we will bring about in months
shall we say at a particular day at a particular time we have this map in our mind
of time quasi set out in space like it is in our diary we commit ourselves to going to a location
to get involved in something that has a topic a purpose and we prepare for it and we journey towards
it all of these things are part of our interaction with others as a kind of scaffolding of ourselves and
behind even the making and honoring of small-scale appointments is what i've called in my book on
time post tense time of the human subject there's basically tenseless time that's a succession of
moments in the physical world there's tensed time past present and future and then there's post tense time in
which human time is as it were articulated in clock time calendrical time the time of our diary historical
time so that all lies behind the promising animal and it's a temporal scaffolding for ourselves
the role of others in maintaining ourselves is very central of course it is
it's very important to be taken for granted it's very important to be recognized it's very important
to have a sense of what others expect of me in terms of behavior attitudes and duties and of course
it's very important that we engage with shared commitments acknowledgement is absolutely fundamental
to our sense of ourself we acknowledge those who acknowledge up us and there's a kind of loop of
reinforcement which begins with the return of the gaze there's also a mutual acknowledgement of our
temporal depth terry my wife and i often reminisce we'll say gosh do you remember that cafe in greece
gosh it was a blazing hot day and she will say describing more events that happened and then i'll
make it bigger and bigger and suddenly we have this pop-up shop we've created between us acknowledging a
shared moment in past time what i've described rather clumsily as the recreational co-curating of
selves in memory and this makes our pasts more real because they are shared and in fact there's nothing
more disturbing for somebody who has a relationship with someone who's starting to dement that they lose
the shared past it's very it's it's the beginning of a very sad bereavement
but i always think co-curating yourself is an absolute miracle now you'll be familiar with this
creature it's a swallow and what swallows do is they'll migrate one year and then the following year
they'll return to the same country the same town the same house the same eaves where they'll return to the
same nest and you think wow how do they pull that off well what about as it were co-curating the self
when we say do you remember such and such do you remember that cafe in greece and i'm talking about
something 10 years ago and i'm looking through intervening hundreds and hundreds of thousands
of experiences and we both land on the same spot that's a fantastic affirmation and existential support
for one's sense of self and enduring relationships of course depend on a shared present shared projects
shared concerns and commitments but also a shared past episodic memories and presupposed memories shared
futures and hanging together as a result courtesy of those with whom we hang out they hold us together
just as we hold them together
so it's important to be taken for granted to be recognized so for example when i go home and open the
front door terry my wife doesn't call the police because it's totally i'm taken for granted of course i come to the house
and also that is built into the sense of what is expected of me in terms of behavior attitudes and above all duties
when i was a doctor if i entered the ward i wasn't thrown off the ward because people say who are you
basically it was expected that i would do a ward round and of course that reinforced my sense of a
continuing self and of course central to enduring relationships is mattering to another who matters
to oneself gives a sense of substance that's not illusory even if sometimes the content is mistaken
sometimes you can be nailed to your past self by shame and guilt by mistakes also just as simple as
thinking oh god i'm late i'm late i'm late the feeling that you're impatiently awaited when you
have made a commitment to an appointment and then there's the literal scaffolding of possessions i'm
rather aware of this we moved house not too long ago and i was very much haunted by what nietzsche said
is that we are possessed by our possessions well yes and no freddie we are also affirmed by our
possessions no don't touch that don't touch me our habitat is like many layered clothes of ourself it is
the inner parish or the inner circuit of a very familiar world and then there's other things that
reinforce our sense of self of being an entity that has that thisness of identity such as having our
papers in order there are a million mirrors in which we are reflected in which we are affirmed as that
person who is this person on being documented is very important there is a scaffolding in having papers
being in order something that preoccupied for example kafka in some of his novels the sense you
weren't simply recognized nobody knew who you were you know etc so going back to it takes a village to
raise a child it takes a world to curate a self and it takes communities of selves to curate a world
so far surprisingly particularly for a medic i haven't mentioned the body
the body is a rather strange creature i can't work out whether it's me or it whether it's my friend or my
enemy there is relationship to our body that is what you might call ambivalent enough already on the puns
but it is it does seem to have qualifications for the job of being the substrate of the self
as some philosophers believe it is after all the literal scaffolding of the self it is a solid
localized spatio-tempo reality if someone says where's raymond well raymond's where his body is
it changes but there is usually continuity across change and it is most importantly the first mediator
of our agency and indeed it's the elemental setter of the agent agenda of our agency it's our bodily
needs that are the ground floor of the agenda of our agency of course we go a little bit beyond that
but that's the ground floor it's more faithful than anything else in my life possessions come and go
my body stays with me it's the one body that's continuously present all other people's bodies
come and go human and non-human and it underwrites a continuous distinct viewpoint
actually i always think of it not so much as a viewpoint as a view blob but that's another
other story and i've emphasized the extent to which it takes a village to create curator self it takes
a world to curate itself but we don't entirely dissolve in the sea of we the body prevents our
eye from dissolving in the sea of we and we has got one e in that context
the body is what you might call an anti-solvent stops us becoming simply a part of a nexus a
location in a community we have a necessarily distinct viewpoint i'm at the moment i am obliged
to have a viewpoint which reveals to me the city of chester that's because that's where my body is
it underpins a unique personal history and that insulates our individual narratives
from those of others there is what you might call the non-fungibility of experiences
your toothache couldn't come my toothache or vice versa and i am where my body is has the speaker
turned up oh well his body has my presence to you ultimately depends on the direct or in this case
courtesy of computers the mediated proximity of our bodies it is the ultimate underpinning
of the community of minds
some people are so persuaded impressed by the body they say actually we are our bodies
this is a view on the self called animalism but of course animalism cannot accommodate disembodied
experiences the sort of memories i've been talking about the thoughts i'm having forward-looking
emotions that are central to selfhood you can't locate those in the body some people might locate
them in the brain but i'm not too sure you can locate them in the body in the way that for example
my spleen is located in my body there is a dissociation of the self from the body much of the time we're wall
gathering and our agenda at any given moment isn't comprehensible in bodily terms
what's more the self i've talked about is tensed it draws on the past and points to the future but
my body is tenseless my kidney is totally innocent at time t10 of time t8 and time t12 and of course
the body cannot fully account for the communal aspects of the self that part of the self that
for example can only be understood in terms of relationships or institutions duties and so on
there's also the fact that my body is incompletely colonized by experience or by knowledge what my
body gets up to without my knowledge is endless there's a distance between its v vita and my c curriculum
there's a fundamental divergence between the it being of my body and the am being of myself so much of my
body is an impersonal it rather than a personal i and you know people sort of say you know i could i
knew something like the back of my hand but i bet if you put my hand the back of my hand in a row of
hands in an identity parade i wouldn't be able to recognize it and i certainly wouldn't be able to
recognize my brain or my spleen so the problem with animalism is really it doesn't address the challenge
of incarnational humanism our embodiment is incomplete i am and i'm not my body but that said
the body helps to underwrite the unity continuity and the reality of the self it's absolutely necessary
for my being recognized so when i arrive at my house my wife opens the door she recognizes who
i am and doesn't call for the police thinking i'm a burglar or whatever
but there's also the problem of scale i mean what is my body
well it's continuous blob of flesh it's a one it's a sort of smorgasbord of giblets
it's a nexus of guided juices oh by the way it's a trillion cells oh and it's trillion trillion trillion
trillion atoms and we need a privileged scale to define the mode of identification of the it of the
body with the eye of the self and we don't have that privilege scale so mapping the one onto the other
isn't something that we can complete because there are no scales in nature never mind privileged ones
the natural world is neither full of things the size of mountains or full of things the size of atoms
depends on the scale of observation so we cannot rely on the body operating at a self scale of attention
in order to unpin underpin i beg your pardon a self so there we are unity over at a time unity over time
standing states within uh our consciousness the social scaffolding of the self courtesy of others
this external internal source of currents the body and then of course we have agency being a self is not
a bundle of perceptions because being a self is not just a spectator sport action is self-affirmation
self-embracing action is aiming especially where the action is effortful pushing and shoving which puts
the self in italics action is rooted in long-term projects depending for example on skills acquired in
the past it's temporarily deep self-affirmation our days are shaped by the agency of previous days our
present realizes our past
and agency is nested it draws on many aspects of the self at many levels think of running for a bus to catch
a train to catch a plane in order to travel to a destination a destination that's defined by what you
intend to do on arrival and what you do on arrival makes sense that draws on many connected aspects
of what one is and there is the conversion with the agency of others at one's destination
eventually i arrive and i meet someone in order that we can have the discussion we've been planning to
have or whatever
you can't separate selfhood from agencies i say being a self is not a spectator sport being rayman
talis is in part doing rayman talis i am and am is a funny verb it's not passive and it's not active
it's what the greeks would call middle voice but somehow you feel amming is something rather positive it
puts rayman talis in italics and of course all the effort of agency reinforces the self even if it's
rather unpleasant pleasant as you're puffing and panting up a hill but i don't want to go too far
i don't want to embrace the views of the german philosopher fichter and say that the ego is entirely
ago that the eye is entirely i do no but doing is central to the being of a self
so there we are these are the sources of coherence this is the self when it's been rescued from those
who would want to reduce it to a bundle of um sensations or whatever sorted but i'm sorry to say
but take heart lands inside not so fast there are disunities in the ever-present
temporally extended bodily underpinned unity we are multiple there are fundamental changes between
the beginning and the end we are inconstant and we are discontinuous what about the changes between
the beginning and the end what about inconstancy what about discontinuity well this is how i looked
in june 1946 and by the way that's not a selfie and this is how i will look in who knows when
so i'm 78 now so it's not going to be very long but this is not a selfie either but you can see
there's a rather dramatic change between the beginning and the end what's more beyond that
things that mattered once no longer matter having said that the transition from mattering to not mattering
has a story we relate to ourselves and the story can be retrieved by the self so that inconstancy
doesn't undermine the notion of substantive selfhood what about discontinuity well we have a daily
discontinuity we fall asleep every night it doesn't that suggest you're sliced into separate selves
wait a moment wednesday morning is able to resume where tuesday night left off we can regain our future
selves after an interruption and indeed we can set the alarm this is the self planning to ambush itself
into the resumption of itself so there you go this is self curating itself
when we wake up in the morning we read on the body we doffed when we went to sleep the surroundings
acquaintances duties ongoing commitments when we had where fell asleep and either lost consciousness
or had all those stupid boring dreams that we waste our life on and we have a unique capacity to do this
so conclusion the self is more than a a bundle of perceptions b a series of time slices c a narrative
construct or d nothing but it isn't a thing nor is it a stuff or a portion of stuff but it's not nothing
it is distinctive it has identity and in order to be not nothing the self doesn't have to be a something
additional to that with which it engages
the work of piecing together the self of course you will view a view of what i've said just towards
the end of my talk is a work in progress and i hope to some extent the talk has highlighted the work
is to be done but i remain grateful for what i said at the beginning to the alter sides to those who
would bump off the self for making visible the complex miracle of the self for helping us untake
the taken for granted which is the essence of philosophy for seeing the mystery as i as a humanist
of see of human incarnation
we haven't still teased out the conceptual geography of the relationship between rival
candidates for the role of the protagonist in this talk i've talked about the self but what about the
i and the transcendental ego and the workaday ego the subject and the person how do they relate to the
self well that you'll be glad to know is the topic for another talk but here's a final reflection
the more i think about myself the stranger i become or feel i should become to myself
you've just been subjected to 50 minutes of being told what you are something you knew already
you've been given philosophy which as is so okay in so often the case with philosophy
just consists of correcting what philosophers have said
it or perhaps more cheerfully assembling reminders for a purpose and what is the purpose celebration
so i thank you for your attention or at least for the courtesy of simulating it thank you very much indeed
thank you
