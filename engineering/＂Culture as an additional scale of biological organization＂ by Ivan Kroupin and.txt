so yes uh so my name is ivan kruppen uh and this is tc chung uh we are and we're going to be
presenting our sort of theoretical framework and some early work on culture as an additional
scale of biological organization or culture as extended distributed development um okay so
just brief intro on who we are and sort of where we're coming from we between the two of us we have
a fairly wide mix of backgrounds developmental and cross-cultural psychology sociology philosophy
genetics cultural evolution um tc is a phd student at harvard i'm a former phd student postdoc at
harvard now postdoc at london school of economics we both work at an institutionalized field site
which i co-direct in on the board of namibia and angola looking at changes from small-scale society
groups that are moving into more urban areas effects of formal education this kind of thing
and we work jointly on our sort of empirical and theoretical research program concerned with
explaining cultural variation from first principles um so there's some a lot of concrete
projects we're working on so reinforcement learning invasion frameworks for thinking about cognitive
variation across groups uh thinking about school versus unschooled reasoning a lot of concrete
empirical projects we'll go into some of this but this is just an overview of sort of where we're
where we're coming from okay um so this is this is going to be first we're going to run through
oh sorry yeah just moving this to okay that's fine um so just gonna we're gonna first run through all
right every the whole plan of the talk where we're gonna go so we kind of have a high level overview of
what's going on this is part one so i'll be i'll be covering part one principally and then tc will be
covering part two principally but we'll both kind of jump in as needed uh okay part one um so first
we're going to think about cultures we want to move towards first principles descriptions of what cultural
systems are like and we're going to move towards the descriptions of cultural systems as
self-sustaining processes in behavior space and of course we're using a lot of your terminology
throughout here um next we're going to think about cultural processes becoming we're going to think
about the change in historical time in cultural processes and the claim we're going to make is that
the change has to do with modularization and layering of these processes as historical time goes
on and which in terms allows for larger scale organization um then we're going to argue that this
dynamic this modularization kind of dynamic is a direct and the and the kind of view of cultural
system as self-sustaining processes is a direct extension of this biological hierarchy that you
talk about so there's a very direct way in which it's just the same set of ideas that kind of perpetuates
into a new new layer and finally part one will focus the kind of the upshot of part one is that
thinking about culture and historical changes in culture from this perspective gives us the first
principles and biologically continuous account for a wide range of social cultural material and
cognitive data so it kind of allows us to explain a lot of space of data from sociologists and cross
cultural psychologists etc etc that previously has had no unified kind of way of thinking so and i'll
represent a little bit of that data as well okay uh dc yeah feel free to draw apart so for part two in
in part one we already see how increases in modularization standardization and hierarchical
organization uh they actually help to explain a lot of the data that we see but there's still the
still the question of why do they happen and how exactly do they happen mechanistically what is going
on for example in a particular cultural process when it undergoes this kind of modularization and
standardization and um the major insight here so we are we're going to try to take an initial
step at answering this but um of course this is all work in progress and we really seek your uh we
really seek all of your opinions and thoughts on this and um we really see this as part of a sort of
co-thinking process the way that we've been thinking about this is that cultural processes niche construct
substrates for each other and that promote each other's unfolding and that this kind of niche
construction can sort of assemblages of all these processes that niche construct for each other can happen
and these assemblages can emerge in two ways one way as uh hollow biontically like these processes
come together and they can recombine and reassort another way however is that these processes need
to be transmitted together they need to persist in the same set of substrate be in close proximity with
each other and um we sort of see this as uh this set of ideas is actually is inspired by some of the
work that you have done and um as we answer this question we realize that this can um answer a whole
bunch of uh this can give more structure to a whole bunch of theoretical issues that people in the
evolutionary social sciences have had for a long time um for example it's been very difficult to think
about why cultural systems can both evolve there's both evolutionary phenomena um which are produced
by natural selection but there's also learning an agency um that takes place in social structure like
how do these two things actually interdigitate um to produce a structure and function in society
and so the upshot of this part is that we can give a first principles account of the nature of what
cultural systems are how they relate and mobilize their substrate and why different societies have
different cultural systems have evolved differently okay so that's our big overview plan uh just to
also put for put out right away kind of the aims we'd like to have in this short talk and discussion
broadly from our end um is just to bring out this conceptual framework and get your input because a
lot of these ideas we believe connect directly to yours and we'd love your thoughts at a broader sort
of level of how they connect there's there's some potential projects that we think come out of this uh if
there are of mutual interest uh in particular part making part two into a paper we think is an
interesting avenue to explore but we'll of course get there when we get there and then looking ahead
i think that there's there's are there's some potentially interesting empirical work across
scales um okay so to finally get to where we're going part one cultural cognitive systems okay so first
just motivating why you know why we should be interested in cultural systems and the and the
fundamental phenomenon we're interested in here so tc and i have been from different angles we
converged on an interest in this really broad historical change from small scale societies this
is actually a drone shot from the the field side where we work from humans all living in small scale
societies to this massive increase of huge of scale and literally biomass in the human population
to most of us living in these large urban conurbations so there's this overall change is
related to a bunch of different sort of indicators um increased social mobility increased social scale
much more complex and layered technology very increasing layers of complexity of institutions
literacy numeracy science schooling etc and this kind of trajectory and change has been identified by
everybody since forever right sociologists philosophers or whoever you want to cite um joe henrik both of
whom we you see is still joe's phd student i was his postdoc has recently written a broad account of
this kind of change as well um there's also a parallel track of changes in individual psychology that
accompanies this shift right and it's seen across the board from across the board in cognitive science
concepts from uh constructs from iq to executive function to relational reasoning formal logic
forms of categorization from the memory model based versus model free thinking visual perception
etc you get this you get stark differences in how individuals perform on measures of all
of these things between small scale societies and larger urban zones more specifically this is often
tied to differences between informal apprenticeship as a more mode of learning where you just grow up in
a village and you become part of that village versus formal schooling as a discrete setting for
learning and we'll we'll come to why formal schooling is particularly interested interesting from our
framework um but the generalization here seems to be that across this change you get this increase in
abstract context independent information processing abilities or dispositions to engage in this kind of
thing so this is again this has been studied by i'm many many many people and there's a huge
evidence historically on this kind of thing um so this is the overall pattern we're interested in
there seems to be something really big going on this kind of shift and uh oh one thing to say is that
none of this is really important to say that this is not progress in any sense there's no claim that this is
an improvement in the human condition there's certainly downsides to this kind of shift we have
more worse mental health it seems like than people in small scale society we're definitely worse on the
ecology um but this is the this is objectively happening this kind of shift okay so why we care is
culture understanding culture is this bogeyman of psychology right so it's clearly has huge effects
but cognitive science has gone out of its way to avoid talking about culture and recently i published
the paper with joe kind of trying to explain why that might be the coin why that might be the case to some
extent culture is also a bogeyman in biology because clearly these are living systems but how exactly
do you characterize cultural systems qual living systems there's been major progress in all these
kind of departments but still accounts of culture tend to be either purely verbal or and or
disconnected from any sort of first principles frameworks so what we want to do here is make
steps towards the general account the problem one having motivated why we care about all this stuff
how do we move towards the first principle definition of cultural systems all right so
cultural systems are biological systems right these are living systems they're composed of living parts
the problem is that they have no body uh which is often a reference points uh for for thinking about
biology um the and they seem to occupy and make use of very diverse substrate so on one hand definitely
human behaviors are part of cultural systems but then there's tools there's institutions there's family
relations technology etc etc so it's a weird kind of unit the move with what we want to make to
paint cultural systems as a coherent type of thing is to shift our perspective to not to entities
but to processes and this is very aligned with many of the ways you've talked about biology the point
being that we want to talk about the way that we can unify across all these substrates is to think
about cultures culture cultural systems as stable processes at multiple level um ie structures like
dynamic structures which are self-sustaining given the appropriate environmental affordances so from
this perspective human behaviors material culture technology all this kind of stuff they're all just
varieties of of affordances that cultural processes require to maintain themselves
um and these structures again using your terminology are solving problems in a particular space so
just briefly this kind of processional view is is very familiar to you um we can think of from
about from like a biology example i think we can think of a cell as a material unit but really in
some sense a cell more fundamentally as a series of processes that are maintaining themselves and replace
drawing what they need from the environment from environmental affordances in order to maintain
this series of processes right um and we can think of cultural systems in a similar way so for
example like a ritual a marriage ritual which persists across time is a persistent process that continuously
draws on affordances from its environments and constructs affordances in its environment as we're
going to see later um in order to persist across time we can also think about social roles like an hr
professional has the same type can be thought of as the same type of structure um the use of
standardized letters or numbers or whatever again is a type of process the the use the use of these
sort of uh symbols in a particular way is a type of process that is independent of the specific
substrate but has a certain set of affordances that it requires in order to persist okay so we're
we're digging this process view on culture and if we think about biological systems generally from this
process view we can actually think of cultural systems kind of neatly emerging as just another
form of process stable process right it's got it's got peculiarities and its substrate is sort of
counterintuitive to us because we we occupy an odd position relative to the substrate here but just
from a process point of view it's pretty it seems pretty continuous or that's the argument we'd like to
make um and so this historical change that we're talking about can be thought of as just increasing
further increasing layers of these kinds of processes that actually are continuous with
increasing layers of organization and processes uh occurring at different levels biology
so the next question is what is the space in which so if the policies are this kind of problem these
this kind of uh uh self-persisting processes that are solving problems in that kind of space what is
what is the space in which they're operating and for now we're calling this and we realize that we the
terminology will be probably need to be improved here but the what we're calling this behavior
space right so it's not just human behaviors but it's the the full sort of set of affordances that
cultural systems tend to tend to use right so it's definitely human behaviors but it's um it's it's you
this also involves the kind of preconditions for the behaviors that are human internal cognitive
organization the availability of certain tools the availability of certain infrastructure etc etc
um okay so yes this is this kind of follows from what we've already been saying
um and again we'll come back to so okay so this is just step one all right we're defining cultural
systems as self-sustaining processes in this sort of behavioral behavior space um problem two for
kind for this project how do cultural system processes increase in scale across historical time so
what's the dynamic what's this what's the nature of the dynamic here um well okay so the shift from
small scale societies to large scale societies again not a question of progress though if we kind of turn
this whole model on the side and think about where is this going in terms of evolutionary time uh the
question we want to ask is what is changing in the our hypothesis is that what were previously relatively
variable process processes become modularized and standardized as they become part of a larger
higher order process so the biological analogy here that you've demonstrated beautifully is
cells becoming part of tissues so cells individual cell behaviors are relative variable relative to
the kind of modulized and standardized behaviors that they engage in once they become part of the
processes of larger tissue systems and so the idea here is that this historical change across in cultural
systems has the same basic structure that what's going on is that previously variable processes becoming
modulized standardized and incorporated into large larger scale things um and here there's there's a
lot of sort of details and we can certainly go into them this isn't just again it's not just human
behaviors so one of the ways that this works is that that behavior previously human behaviors become
packaged into technologies and that allows that facilitates their standardization so those those
processes that were variable by virtue being done by humans become built into a machine and then become
much more standardized as i say there's more kind of more details but that's the basic hypothesis of what's
going on um again we see this as directly extend and the direct extension of the kind of stuff you talk about
in terms of modular structure within about uh organism level biology um and the the term we've been using in to
describe the difference between cultural systems that are relatively sort of at the first layers of this
type of organization to relatively higher levels is a difference in depth of standardization our rule of
thumb for describing this stuff as being like if you think about any given object you can think about how many
standard processes had to happen for you to use it so for a flint knife basically not you get the
flint you nap it you use them use the knife to use a macbook like the number of standard the layers of
standard processing are crazy from you know mineral extraction to processing whatever so we have clear
differences in terms of that standardization across these groups um you see you want to take this
so so here are just some examples uh to illustrate these differences in depth of standardization and some
of the differences in sort of um from a cognitive point of view the kinds of information processing
that you have to do but also in terms of the behavior of the tools themselves how they interact
with each other or how um decontextualized and compositional they are um in terms of the behavior of
the tools um so one can compare for example flint knapping to building um sorry to building something
in minecraft so these involve very different kinds of physical manipulations one can imagine um for
example uh making a bed out of uh you know raw materials um in a in a sort of traditional
carpentry versus assembling furniture that you purchase from ikea think about how communicate
communicable the skills are think about uh um how heterogeneous versus homogeneous the kinds of
behaviors are um one could think about you know maximizing your basket of goods be they social or
material goods um in a traditional sort of exchange ceremony let's say a potlatch versus you know
bitcoin trained in right so uh we can we can see how the skills um change over time because the
systems change over time and um there's also a hierarchical aspect of this because um when we look
at these are actually a culture that uh the himba women engaging in traditional um construction of
their houses um there isn't a lot of layers of hierarchy in terms of the different processes that
are taking place but this is quite different for example when we are thinking about building a
cathedral where there's abstractions like uh columns you know stories that exist at multiple levels
there's often a bureaucracy that manages the entire construction process which once again have to deal
with different abstractions at different levels different kinds of standardization at different
levels and so why does this happen we think that um it's because when you actually look at what tools
are doing for example carrying a basket of apples versus carrying apples with your bare hands you know
catching butterflies with a net versus catching a butterfly with your bare hands or um catching a
mouse using a trap versus catching a mouse with bare hands both physical and social tools stuff like
bureaucracies and so on and so forth can act um in this markov blanket kind of way which is using um
some of the terminology from your work they allow skills to be chunked and to be represented
abstractly in a way that uh was not actually possible before yeah so so this naturally uh yeah so
the proposal here again kind of zooming out is that all right we're interested in these increases
in scale and all the concomitant stuff that's going on there social material and psychological
recent scale require these increases in depth of standardization and again the claim here is general
that this in living systems generally this is the type of thing that's happening um and what we
describe this at the cultural level as is a rich lean shift so we've been describing these smaller
scale societies with more kind of less modular and hierarchically organized processes as richer
societies and then leaner societies are the ones with the greater depth of standardization
um so okay so this has gotten us through cultural processes have become modularized and layer layered
across historical time um and the claim here is that there's a direct extension of how what's going
on on organism level biology um okay so now we try to map some of the data and i'm going to move a
little bit quickly because then we're we're moving towards towards the half points again this is the
data that we're interested in this huge body of work from various disciplines about this type of
then general type of change which maps onto these increasing layers of organization in various ways
and then there's something equivalent going on on the cognitive side so what so one way of kind of
approaching this is to think okay where did this all start um at the first layer so let's just start
where this first type of this this layer organization emerged in the first place in small scale societies
what you can imagine prior to modularization and layering what you would expect that this kind of
first layer is a kind of integrated like these processes should all be very context specific
integrated boutique they all grew up in this there's not a lot of kind of recombination
and compositionality yet and so what you might expect is uh kind of them being built into very specific
environments and here for example is uh this is from the sociologist pierre bordieu who talks about
uh that he he worked with the cabinet people in northern africa and this is just a their their map
of how they think about their uh life basically and for them everything is very interrelated the in the
the the harvest is related to birth is related to dry and wet seasons all this kind of stuff
and the and their processes and practices are also very very interrelated for them internally
cognitively and they literally have dependencies in terms of how these processes interact with one
another um and then what happens if we go up the sort of depth of standardization or modularity and
layering scale well you end up with compositional discrete general purpose patterns across domains
so for example here's a school schedule right and it's just sort of visible the difference in
structure you have this discrete compositional organization of activities each activity can be replaced
by a different activity they slot in and out they're completely separable from one another etc etc so what
our claim is that this is it's basically reflecting exactly this kind of dynamic um and here's this
is well i won't spend time on this this is uh uh from a review of the effects of formal schooling uh
on cognition that is a preprint of ours now and this just contrasts traditional education versus formal
schooling in exactly this kind of set of set of differences um okay so social material patterns
change this is what the claim here is that this is that what we're seeing is this change in sort of
layers of modular modularity and organization this has gotten us to social material data very generally
what about cognitive data well basically again very briefly the human mind is the most adaptive sort of
cognitive system we know about um maybe we'll invent some other ones soon but for the time being it's the
most adaptive one we know about so if there are these very systematic changes in the organization
of the cultural system where we are interfacing with we should expect internal equivalence so in
recent paper we've talked about this as our articulation between cognitive systems and and their
environments but the principle is very is kind of very straightforward the claim here briefly is and
we're working on models of models of this both from the bayesian and reinforcement learning perspective
at the moment but you would predict that in a modular hierarchically structured type of environments
you would get changes that correspond to this kind of psychology to what is observed in in in the
psychological literature so what you're going to get are cognitive systems that are better at detecting
discrete games uh within the environment and not assuming that they're related to everything else around them
and then have a kind of a stash of moves of how to maneuver maneuver within these discrete games
that they identify right and this is going to apply from everything from iq tests to like going
to a new store and buying that you've never been to best buy before but you know this is going to be a
discrete game you're you know the kind of thing that you should be looking for whereas that kind of
discretization of the environment and applying abstract sort of ideas of how to solve different games is just not efficient in a small scale society
you're going to cut out context that's important for your social interactions or whatever whatever
so again this is the this sort of falls straight out of the the predictions of our overall accounts
i'm going to really briefly go through some examples of from cross-cultural psychology uh we can
go to almost any length with these there's there's a huge volume of them but this is the first one is
kind of nice because it's from uh alexander lurio uh very possibly you know this this is the basic
syllogism test that he was administering to schooled and non-school populations the question is all bears
in the north are white no wisdom days in the north what color are the bears in no ways in that uh school
populations uniformly respond white non-school populations overwhelmingly respond i don't know
i've never been there or something along those lines so the school population is discretizing this
piece of information using only the premises and answering within the context whereas non-school
population is treating this as a broader it's just integrated with the rest of our conversation and
you're some guy that's shown up from moscow and you're asking me about bears and i'm trying my best
to to uh satisfy your curiosity and you get this in all sorts of cognitive tasks so this is a task
sorry could i ask a question um on the previous on the previous one what what um what kind of
instructions are they given before this what are they told about this anything nothing so this is just
like this is they're entered into conversation i at most they might be told that this is a puzzle i
don't remember if they prefaced it with this but mostly they were just sitting around the kind of
whatever okay yeah i was just curious if if they were given any um instructions to sort of believe the
first statement as in like assume this is correct and then go from there was it but nothing like that
was it no no yeah so exactly this is testing a disposition kind of disposition this their dispositional
treatment of this kind of information and that there's a whole we could there's a whole rabbit
hole about the differences between dispositions and capacity and so how they relate to it
but to your point uh paul harris later ran a study with his colleagues where if you preface
this kind of thing with imagine a world where yeah then the non-school populations are performing
basically the same same way as school populations and that's doing exactly that thing where it's like
it discretizes it sort of mechanical not mechanically but it discretizes the problem from their
lived experience and then they they work through the logic interesting okay um so but it's not always
just dispositions so here there's the game is you see you get four cards and you need to sort them
into two piles by some dimension so it can be color number shape you make one sort and then you're asked
to resort them to a different dimension then you have to resort them to a different dimension
school populations this is trivial kids that by the age of four have no problem with this
non-school populations adults struggle very significant right so i keep forgetting to put
the percentages on this slide but it's something like you only it's only 70 that are doing the second
sorts and then they're still i forget how many there's a substantial percentage that aren't getting
the third sort either so you have you have a real difficulty in getting and this is with repeated
repeated uh demonstrations and instructions and explanations etc etc still it's just something
about this concept that's not coming across them um this is work from glick gay and cole back in 1967
just to give an example from some of our work this is a study on a very very very common executive
function task that i ran in uh bolivia and the field site namibian angola this is in collaboration
with helen davis uh who i co-direct the namibian field site with but also joe henrik and emily burdette
um basically the task is you match first you get the kids are the kids see a box with blue rabbit box
with the red boat then they get cards with blue boats and red rabbits first we play and then you tell
them first we play the color game in the color game blue goes with blue red goes with red they do six
trials of that after that you say stop we are not playing the color game anymore now we're playing
the shape game in the shape game rabbits go with rabbits both go with bugs so stimuli stay the same
but the mapping of the dimensions switches um this is like an uber classic executive function uh task in
the west kids in the west are are before the age of uh four or five they tend to perseverate so even though
you told them to switch dimensions they continue matching on the original dimension
um and these are our results from the cross-cultural uh population so we replicate the the u in the uk
we replicate the classic finding since forever that kids by age five are at ceiling and then we get
massive cross-cultural variation um and especially in non-school populations right bolivia has this is
like is a long and funny not funny it's a complicated story they're sort of semi-schooled
schooled conini kids are living in namibian angola but they're going to school from the villages
and then unschooled coniniere folks with non-literate no exposure to formal schooling
and so the the point the the way that we would interpret this is that this is another piece of
evidence that this kind of extracting a discrete structure from the environments identifying the
rules and being comfortable with the rules being arbitrary and switchable is an adaptation to an
environment which is built out of layered modular systems where you're going to run across the stuff all
the time where and you you're constantly interacting with these modular kind of processes which you
require which require switching between rule sets pretty flexibly and so there's like if a 15 year
old failed this task in the us you should be worried i mean it's really it would be really a massive
outlier but the connecticut's they're hurting like at 15 they're hurting hundreds of cattle like they
have no problems right there's it's not it's not an issue they're not like cognitively delayed for their
environments but what their adaptations are seem to be really very different and again we would
claim a line with this broader account um all right i'm gonna for sake of time i'm gonna skip this
one this is just another example kind of the same vein here's another chart from that or another table
from from that in the review of formal schooling which is just gestures towards this being a really
huge literature everything from piagetian tasks to any number of cognitive tasks to the uh like um
um conditioning tasks from the animal literature all of them basically show these these kind of
systematic differences in the same direction um finally just to review to uh to to jump to another
domain so you get all these cognitive effects right in terms of how people are performing on tasks
but the account we're describing the processes we're describing the cultural the like the the biological
units we're describing these cultural processes they're indifferent to domain in the way that we think
about domain so they want modularity and organization and affordances that are going to have this
structure across the environment across the space they're solving problems in generally um so we may
predict that you're going to get this not only in terms of the problems that people encounter when
they're solving them but even the material culture we interact with should have this modular layered kind
of structure and in fact it sort of kind of clearly does in some sense at least intuitively it seems to
you right in small scale societies there are almost no repeating forms you have relatively few types of
objects but the tokens of the object are variable right every house is a little bit different every
knife is a little bit different whereas we live in a world with endless types but very high within type
homogeneity and so one might expect that this will have predictable consequences for something like
your adaptation of the visual system and the most the most salient uh perhaps uh symptom of this kind
of layered modular compositional structure are 90 degree angles it's just much easier to build with
them right it's a much easier type of structure to utilize and if we look around and if you look around
you'll see a endless number of 90 degree angles in small scale societies they're basically none of them
or none that are perfect and very and those that are there they don't repeat all that often
okay so this is a study of visual perception that i did again at the field side with michael mith
krishnan is a professor at lsc talia conkle who's the vision professor uh here at harvard um and again
helen davis as always so this is a visual illusion it's called the coffer illusion um i don't know if
you've seen it before but usually uh so there's i'm sure you see rectangles here do you see circles in the image
uh only once you've mentioned it as soon as you said it i couldn't see it be until you said it
okay yeah so but this is and some people have a really hard time seeing them most people actually
do uh but uh as as i'll show there's there's a subset of the population that's kind of has
as your pattern where it's quite quick than other circles but generally speaking it's hard for us to
see these circles what we but the prediction is here this is an ambiguous stimulus where there's two
competing percepts one of which involves the detection of right angles so the prediction here
is fairly straightforward like if we live in right angled worlds we should be more likely to see
them here's the data from this visual illusion right so there's three populations uk us standard
sample uh a pool which is the town we work in near in the field site so it has some structured
stuff but it's but it's still uh so it's much less structured than the uk us population but much
more so than the villages where there's really no kind of industrial style um buildings pattern of
data so there's four possible response types to this to this illusion uh you can see only the
rectangles uh and not spontaneously see the circles so if i ask you what do you see rectangles do you see
anything else you say no the other type is do you see what do you see you say rectangles
you see anything else pause and then you say circles right so you spontaneously see circles circles
and then you just have the reverse patterns you could see circles first and then if spontaneously
rectangles you could see only circles this is the uk us data which uh we've replicated actually a
couple of times as well since then overwhelmingly only rectangles uh substantial uh minority see
rectangles and circles spontaneously a few people circles rectangle zero people in a 300
person sample see circles for safe circles only and then you just get a sort of wild wildly different
pattern in uh in the town and even more so in the village so this is a very different and then we've
also so since then we've expanded oh by the way and since then we've started running visual statistics
uh so this is through talia just visual statistics to the environments we've done it in uk us and uh a pool so
far and this is just a four-year transform uh where the the more signal you have on the axes the more
90 degree basically 90 degree and 180 degree lines you have very strong signal in western context and
then a pool is this like you just you you can tell that it's much smaller we don't have the all the
images we need for the villages yet but presumably it's going to be even lower right and so we're working
on building a model that would actually like capture reproduce these data from the input we've
also now done a bunch of other illusions which i'm not going to go into because i'm uh we're running out
of time but the result is consistent so basically these kinds of shapes and regular shapes that that
we seem to be very good at inferring and you would predict we'd be good inferring because of the
structure of our world we don't they don't actually crop up in illusions um okay so that's
that's part one where we're running a little bit late but we'd love if you have any any
sort of comments or questions so far um happy to pause for the moment yep no it's all good it's
all right keep going okay all right okay okay so i will try to move through this as uh fast as possible
but it's potentially the case that uh we might still have quite a lot of content so uh just raising
if we would like to if you would like to continue the conversation um i hope we will have a chance to
do that um so we have seen that there are these differences in depth of standardization but what
are the evolutionary dynamics that actually drive this how does this look like so um this is an
incomplete account because it's our first attempt to come up with something like this but really the
background is just niche construction all these different processes can um niche construct structure
into different substrates into the resources that other processes have to use and these can be
affordances that exist in the psychological realm in the physical world in social norms and social
structures so on and so forth and um therefore these affordances can be divided into internal and
external forms and um the main point is that assemblages of mutually niche constructing cultural
processes can adapt they can attain their adaptive capacity into to in two different ways in one way
there is community assembly and sort of just um selection kind of operating in the other way there is
uh more something that is is more um that is more similar to a developmental process and we think
this actually corresponds to the rich lean um distinction that we set up in the previous section
um and here's how we would go through this um go through this logic the first part uh we will just
see some examples of how standardized cultural processes have evolved have emerged um culturally evolved
culturally over time some examples and some some themes of this and then um after that we're going to cover
in a real quick overview um the evolutionary forces and dynamics behind holobiosis and autobiosis
and then after that we're going to take a deeper look at holobiosis and autobiosis um these words by
the way uh especially autobiosis is really a neurologism and we are trying to like trying to figure out how to
talk about this in a quite a you know quite a uh short way so um how to standardize cultural processes emerge
some examples um increases in scale of cultural processes uh require standardization of lower
process lower level cultural processes really saw some examples of this in the previous section
um some examples that we're going to see now are in symbolic communication the move from informal
nanonic science systems to uh standardized science systems of uh communicative science the most the
best example of this is writing another one is in the realm of economic exchanges so from a move from
barter between sort of highly heterogeneous and idiosyncratic baskets of goods to money um there's
also a movement from traditional systems of local navigational problem solving in less formally
regularized landscapes to um for example a urban environment with a lot of standardized roads with
address systems that you can actually uh street signs and so on and so forth that you can navigate
using uh something like waymo for example a relatively inflexible algorithm um and there's a move from
traditional building methods so these are actually a west and dean um stones every stone is carved in
a bespoke way to uh building um building out of bricks and mortar um and we're going to go deeper into
one of these examples which is the evolution of writing of symbolic physical symbolic communication
systems that have been investigated extensively by anthropologists um on one end of the sort of
non-standardized to standardized spectrum you have the use of private signs so this is signs that a person
and carves into a physical substrate for their memory they're they're putting this down so that they
can remember this themselves later on um moving to a slightly more you know generalizable you know use
of signs you have informal science used for example in aboriginal um sand drawing which they they do when
they're telling stories so whole group of people share a science system um then you move on to semi-formal
science like shamanic writing which you find um for example in native americans and as well as in ancient
chinese shamans that's actually the origin of the chinese logographic writing system um and you have
token systems in trade so um all these clay tokens that you see uh mesopotamian traders use they would
wrap up these tokens in clay they would fire the clay and when goods change change hands across a
distance they would break the seal to see you know if the numbers tally and last of all you have
standardized science systems like written communication right and so what are the properties
that actually lead to one of these sort of being more you know standardized than the other used in
a more standardized way namely used in a more decontextualized and compositional way um one of
these is that in one case the use of the signs are highly bound to a specific context in order to use a
sign to deploy it and to uh for the use of the sign to spread you have to um know the very specific
context contextual details of how actually the sign was deployed this is the case mo this is the um
this is the most intense for private science and it steadily gets uh less and less the case as you
move to standardized science systems so you move from bound science to um you move from um the usage
of bound science systems to eventually unbound science systems and um we see similar processes
taking place um in all of these other examples that we were talking about and what this causes is
that you have different higher level cultural processes that share parts which are sort of
component cultural uh cultural processes that are recombined repeatedly over the course of behavior
so um in communication we saw that uh as you move towards um more and more standardized science
systems you have shared meaning subsets that reuse frequently across communicative acts within a
population and that these meanings can be interpreted without reference to specific contextual details
for money you see that um exchanges more and more exchanges take place you know with these
intermediary transactions that take place for example in and out of cigarettes so cigarettes emerge
as currency very frequently in prisons for example and eventually that takes a that takes on a bigger
and bigger role within the whole exchange economy within navigation we see that you know once roads and
so on and so forth have been built there's increasing numbers of uh movement steps that are shared
between members of a population and of course in construction you have uh interchangeable components
and so what this causes is that you get increasing um numbers of interchangeable subcomponent
cultural processes that um come in types basically that are uh that are in some sense homogeneous with
respect to the higher level uh cultural process and we see this happening actually in all of the
examples that we uh we described previously so so the problem we start with is is um this immediately
faces uh faces us with a second problem which is under what conditions does this kind of standardization
emerge in a cultural system because all the examples we saw it's not true that all societies use
standardized writing systems right so clearly there are some conditions which push towards you know
that type of uh outcome and some processes that don't so um we have to address the question of what are
some of the forces that um drive these uh different patterns of um evolution and cultural systems
and one solution that we've been thinking about is a distinction between what we call autobiosis and
holobiosis so this is all very new and we're just interested in what you think about this
um this we were very inspired by your way of thinking about um evolution and development as two
routes to functional structure that in some sense are there's some abstract sense in which they are
equivalent and that they can interdigitate in complex ways and um basically in holobiosis where most of
the adaptation emerges from selection processes what happens is you have sort of have this ocean of
heterogeneous cultural processes and they give rise to higher level on cultural processes that
constantly reuse parts and um the parts survives as survive as types and this requires large numbers of
standardized interchangeable processes processes with respect to the higher level process so that's
like for example the use of each letter for example the handwriting can be a little bit different you
know the glyph can be a little bit different but from the respect uh from the point of view of the
linguistic communication process it's not that important but for you know more informal sign systems
any kind of difference between symbols can play a role right so it's not it's not it doesn't have the same
quality on the other hand you can have autobiosis where you have bodies of cultural processes that
can only persist together and this collective set contains um sort of very very complicated internal
patterns of interdependencies they drive increased agency in the substrate that it mobilizes and the
processes can and must deform in the presence of each other so they are actually less standardized um so this
is a high level overview but um one now we're going to go through sort of like the nitty-gritty of this
but um as we go through that we also realize um as we're thinking through this that this way of
thinking about cultural processes also lets us answer a second yet another set of questions which is
in what sense are human cultures super organisms um this can lead to sort of a general theory for how
structure and function and cultural and organismic systems emerges from the same processes the same
forces and in a continuous way and you know from what angles should you look at um human cultural
systems to see sort of their organismic nature because this has always been a very confusing thing to
evolutionary social scientists um basically evolutionary social scientists have always divided into two
groups this is of course a massive oversimplification but you do see these two streams
there's one group who would think of culture as genetics or culture as evolving gene pools
cultures are populations of different sort of cultural traits cultural variants variation comes
from mutation and adaptation comes from cultural selection which is a kind of natural selection over
the cultural gene pool but there's a different group that sees cultures as social systems that are
in some sense super organisms these super organisms can emerge grow sinise and die and adaptation comes from
agential processes such as development to growth learned responses and the cultural or superorganism has
internal structures with functions and um these two uh different traditions they have lots and lots of
different social scientists sociologists anthropologists who have supported them um and they go back to
quite far so you can see uh as far back as caldoon there is more of this like organismic idea um and nowadays we have
more in in sort of canonical cultural evolution in in anthropology as a scientific field there's more
of a cultural genetics idea so um how can this tension be resolved we think combining the processual view
of of culture and holobiosis and autobiosis both of which were inspired by your ideas we can sort of
resolve this tension because both processes are taking place to shape culture and um so now we can go dig a
little bit deeper into niche construction so yeah we're first going to dig into niche construction
and after that holobiosis and autobiosis so the important thing about culture is that the cultural
processes are distributed they involve multiple substrates that can be separated in space and time
not necessarily in the body that can count as a single unit and this means that different lots and
lots of different cultural processes can reuse and share the same substrate which means that niche
construction forces are extremely they're especially intense this is especially the case in individual
human minds for example cultural processes that have to activate in the individual human activities
in order to uh proceed they're all sharing the same substrate so that the kind of mutual niche
construction effect is very very powerful so i'm in biology we have inter so so um here we can draw
analogy between biology and culture wherein biology have interdependent autocatalytic chemical processes in the
cell or alternatively at the origins of life all the different chemical processes sort of generate the
parts for each other or at least furnish the conditions for one another to to take place in culture
one analogy that we can provide is if you imagine what sorry one example that we can provide is that
if you can imagine a cultural group that only only has the nail use nail production process versus a
hammer use and hammer production process clearly if you have both of these um cultural processes taking place within the
society they the the combination of these two will um will uh persist better than if only one of them was
available and we have cargo cults right cargo culture are a great example of there's some
there's some cultural processes that go in but because the overall sort of infrastructure the overall sort of niche
construction process the whole system is not there therefore you know it cannot sustain itself within
the within the culture that is being um influenced so um what are these substrates can we go into these
substrates in greater detail uh we can divide just like the distinction that we raised previously between
internal and external we can divide them into sort of mental substrates and physical social substrates
for mental substrates cultural processes can shape and alter you know attention representation you know the
kinds of concepts that you have which affect how learnable different um cultural activities are
they can also affect motivation right they can spark affection effective states motivational states
different cultural processes can engineer different goals this means that for example when culture can
shape the social and physical environment to create opportunities to spark the deployment of some
process like for example nails and hammers do for one another um that's that's that's that's
an interdigitation between how the external environment is shaped and how the mental substrates are shaped
and of course there's other energetic things that have to be shaped and so on and so forth so from
the point of view of the cultural process these are all structured substrates containing these affordances
that help the process to persist in its unfolding and different cultural processes can compete with
each other for the substrate or they cannot facilitate one another and um yet more examples so we
already saw hammer use and nail use yeah um should we move to questions no no maybe just get to
part of part of us okay yeah yeah so so toolkits and industries are example they're just massively
expanded examples of hammers and nails and then you but you also have social behaviors right a very quick
one which i'm sure i think you you would be very familiar with game theoretic social behavior so tit for
tat if somebody manifests this behavior other other people are sort of forced to driven
into that state um but there's also lots of other things things like high intensity kinship norms
that cause the persistence of ethnic and caste networks um so a whole bunch of different
behaviors persist together personalistic norms here you see a putin with his judo buddy who continued to
dominate russia so when you have personalistic norms this will lead to personalistic networking
behavior and um cultural processes can also the the different cultural processes can exist at
different levels right at more concrete or abstract and for abstract is things like science or the
nation or the space race or something like that so those actually need to mobilize the more concrete
processes for their persistence okay autobiosis holobiosis so quickly um so in autobiosis what happens
is the archetypical case is a multicellular organisms adaptation comes from developmental like
processes agency among fixed partners adaptation takes place through developed development and learning
and um the adaptation emerges through tokens surviving but then when you look at holobiosis the
archetypical case is microbial communities agency comes from selection like processes like a community
assembly adaptation emerges at the ecosystem level through multi-level selection and types survive
so in culture we can see we can see both kinds of processes taking place an example of a more
autumn biontech kind of process is a single kfc surviving and persistent persisting over time
by modifying its offerings staff numbers hours physical interior community activities so the
substrates the people psychology physical and social processes they are like uh being modified in
situ there's like a certain like um there's a certain token that is being modified but then more
hormone biontech is the fast food industry in a whole region surviving and persisting over time kfcs
you know a whole bunch of kfcs in boston can be flexibly replaced by wendy's applebee's
chipotle subway fast food professionals vendors and machines are constantly circulating between the
stores um and um that constantly reassemble and assemble them and um because under so under autobuses
you have more quote unquote like so so you know if you can imagine this sort of not just taking place
with the fast food industry but um with like culture in general so all kinds of different cultural
processes across physical across mental substrates then we get we look back into rich and lean because
in autobiography biontech processes the processes have to be deformed under the power of the agential
substrate which is the human mind together with the other cultural processes and how they have built
the mind to develop a rich set of interdependencies so that the collective persists but then for the lean
kind of um adaptation the processes can be executed by humans or organizations in a very context-free way
they're solving very small problem and the overall adaptation takes place from sort of reassembling
all these um problem-solving devices into sort of this uh larger structure but just briefly like the
survival of uh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah small scale society versus like a market yeah like a
market system yeah so here we have um more more examples like a vertically integrated firm is more
autobiotic uh supply chains and industries more holobiotic a firm itself is more autobiotic industrial
civilization is more holistic kinship group clan gangs are more automatic and personal organizations
together with their roles like a hr professional managers workers are more holobiotic the house of
saud is a very authentic and the social media platform is very holobiotic and as can be expected
the relationships between people in the house of saud they involve a very different psychology than the
relationships between people in a social media platform um and this goes again to what we talked
about previously decontextualization compositionality uh and this kind of um markov blanketing process
and so we actually uh go back to the rich being as a description as a description of these uh this
spectrum yeah so we were thinking that so this is all very preliminary and we have no idea without
this this makes sense we are not sure how to formalize any of this so we just think that it will be
amazing to chat with you further and to um really just sort of cool brainstorm and work through um
some of these ideas we are very curious about your thoughts and um especially and and the goal would
be to reach a scale-free and substrate-free uh kind of description of standardized cultural processes uh
emerging from non-standardized ones that links it to biology and um the we also have some other
questions yeah yes let's let's let them go okay okay go back go back yeah yeah yeah sorry yes more
material than we uh yeah yeah a bit of work yeah super thanks so much it's it's it's very interesting
stuff um let's uh let's let's we'll we'll we'll make another meeting and we'll and we'll dig into it
that's all right okay exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly yeah
exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly absolutely exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly 인데 of us
y
