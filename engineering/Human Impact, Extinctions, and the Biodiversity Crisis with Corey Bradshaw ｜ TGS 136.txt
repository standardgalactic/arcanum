we're looking at a series of death by a thousand cuts in many cases of the combination of a rapidly
changing climate but just the expansion of humans and their needs i mean even if we live in a
completely eco-friendly way and have very low per capita consumption and we live you know not in
this high consumption manner that we have today we completely change the economic system or it's
forced upon us by collapse there's still so many of us and we still eat and we will still hunt and we
will still take resources until they're gone and then subsequently we will be of lower density i
don't think humans are going to go extinct anytime soon but there will be a point when the earth's
carrying capacity and i think we've surpassed that by several decades already will no longer
be able to support the numbers that are there
i would like to welcome australian professor cory bradshaw to the program to discuss his latest
research on the sixth mass extinction as well as human population demographics i would like to
caution viewers this is not an episode for the faint of heart if i was still teaching i would probably have
to issue a trigger warning uh it's very intense uh some of the topics on climate
mass extinction's human population but uh you all show up here to learn about the world we face
so it's an excellent conversation and i hope you listen to it but it's intense uh cory bradshaw
is a matthew flinders fellow in global ecology at flinders university in australia he's published
over 300 peer-reviewed scientific articles he's also the director of the global ecology laboratory
and a chief investigator in the arc center of excellence for australian biodiversity and heritage
cory's research is mainly focused on global change ecology how human endeavors and climate
fluctuations have altered past present and future ecosystems this episode is densely packed with
information and while it does paint a daunting picture of what we face it's my continued belief
that to address the situation we face we have to understand uh what we face and all that it entails
that being said i greatly enjoyed this conversation with cory and i've asked him to uh be the anchor
on a population roundtable in the near future this was one of our most potent episodes uh last but not
least i would like to remind listeners that we are not a monetized podcast so one of the biggest ways you
can support us is by following and subscribing on whatever platform you use to listen additionally

support with that please welcome cory bradshaw professor bradshaw good to see you good morning oh good
evening it's good evening for me good uh good morning for you in in adelaide australia uh so you lead a very
busy academic life uh publishing papers teaching articles book chapters on a wide range of ecological topics
we have a lot of natural scientists uh colleagues uh as mutual friends and today i'd like to focus on the
topics of biodiversity mass extinctions as well as human population and human demographics uh which
are among your specialties uh especially with regard to two recent papers of yours which we will
highlight in the in the show notes um for people to look them but before we dive into all that maybe you
could uh share with our viewers your background what inspired you to be a research ecologist
oh i have a very weird background actually in some ways i i didn't go through the normal um channels
which seems to be the case for almost all ecologists that i yeah i suppose i guess it's
it's probably normal and from that group of people uh but despite my accent i actually grew up in western
canada and uh my father was uh a fur trapper and uh i spent a lot of time in the bush as a kid
in fact the first time i saw a city i was 16 years old uh yes i've spent most of my life in australia
but that's how i started and um growing up with a trapper father um puts you in contact in a rather
consumptive way but puts you in contact with a lot of the nature of nature and i think that's where it
started i i was interested in how animals behaved and how they adapted to their environments and and i
saw it sort of the the the gritty end of that um but over time i realized that uh even people like
fur trappers who as again are quite consumptive in their use of nature in in that time uh they were
actually one of the largest uh lobbyist groups for uh reducing deforestation rates because you cut down
the bush and there's no fur to trap there's no fur animals to trap so there was a conservation ethic
underneath that that uh had an ulterior motive but it was actually quite uh efficient in convincing
government that that they shouldn't just cut everything down so that was my introduction um sort
of the into the deep end of conversation but on that just to just to pinpoint that they weren't
trying to conserve on behalf of nature they were conserving because they wanted something for their
own bottom line profits so it was still in the name of of profits and progress etc absolutely um but you
know if you don't have a healthy ecosystem you don't have animals to trap and so they were very strongly
vocal uh about keeping those ecosystems in some form of balance and you know everything from bushfire
prevention to logging to uh over hunting um and and even introduced uh species so not to age you but
i assume you were born in the late 60s early 70s 1970 yes so how does uh in british columbia yes yeah in
the rocky mountain so how does the megafauna today relative to the early 70s and the things that were
trapped yeah not having lived in canada for a long time it's difficult for me to say exactly what's
going on but my understanding is that a lot of those animals are still doing relatively well i mean
despite all of the other declines everywhere else but uh a lot of those places that were trapped um
as far as i know still have the tree cover which is probably one of the main things i mean habitat loss
being one of the principal drivers of biodiversity decline now things have changed obviously climate
change things are warming up distributions are changing so i can't speak with any authority
about a lot of the species but i haven't been aware of any at least any extinctions in those regions
i i was in yukon territory a few years and that's one of the few geographical areas in the world where
the historic relationship of megafauna biomass to humans is still largely what it used to be yeah
um nowhere else it's very similar um yeah i was actually just in canada in quebec actually the
last few um last month and i was still quite surprised how much tree cover is there and yes a lot of
that is secondary growth uh from over exploitation centuries ago but you know there's still some very
beautiful um and very productive areas so i'm still i'm pleased to see that so carry on with your
your story sorry to interrupt uh after that i uh was lucky enough to get a scholarship to go to an
international school on vancouver island and uh that really sort of started my pathway on the academic
side of things uh i did the international baccalaureate which is a kind of a bridging program
in international uh curriculum that really focuses on developing your own capacities and i was in a
beautiful spot um outside of victoria on vancouver island in this little bay and we we did scuba diving
we did um sailing we had our lab was right on the water so we had lots of marine components to the to
the ecology courses that i was taking and i really sort of got hooked on the academic side of things and
realized that a lot of my knowledge was actually applicable and perhaps i could even turn it into a career
so after that i uh ended up going to uh do my undergraduate at the university of montreal in
montreal and that had a strong ecological stream they're very well known for their especially their
plant ecology uh and a lot of entomology and so i became very uh astute in the in in discovery and
in taxonomy of the laurentian region around uh sort of central quebec uh and uh that just sort of
precipitated into a master's and eventually a phd and i decided i'd leave canada permanently around
then so i went to new zealand i did my phd at the university of otago in dunedin and i saw some pretty
amazing spots around new zealand got to some very remote areas i was working on fur seals at the time
nothing terribly scientifically interesting in in retrospect but it got me to some really cool
places and i'd sort of cut my teeth in the mathematical side of things and i guess from
there that's where i really became uh probably more of a computational or a modeler computational
biologist or a modeler and these days i'm you know back in the day i used to spend nine months of
the year in the field and now i'm mostly coding and listening to death metal when i do it
and that's how that's my brief journey given the topic um okay so um
i had earlier this year um a science journalist named peter brannan on who talked about uh the five
previous mass extinctions and many minor extinctions um can you just give me a bird's eye view uh speculate
where are we with respect to a sixth mass extinction event what what is the stance based on your
lifetime of scholarship and and research into that topic yeah i've written about that quite a bit
recently and uh it's it's good to understand the deep time aspect in fact i'm doing a lot of deep time
paleontology these days even back to the ediacaran so over 500 million years ago been just working
on a lot of devonian stuff so in the 360 to 400 million year range and how do we know stuff from
360 million years ago just from fossils yeah pretty much it's in the rocks um you've got to be
a bit of a geologist to do good deep time paleontology all in the sedimentary material
and the precision i mean the the preservation and some of these lagerstetter these these amazing
preservation sites are just gobsmacking so you can you can really track the evolution i'm working
i've just published my first paper on the evolution of coelacanths for example and the the history of
the record there is it's astounding it goes back to over 400 million years ago and we can pinpoint
very minor evolutionary changes and and you know even stem tetrapods right up to you know the emergence of
the first reptiles and amphibians so you can pinpoint the uh evolutionary trajectory of coelacanths when
they had adaptations and were better swimmers or whatever else just from using today's science yeah
and we know when things went extinct precipitously and that's how we really track these mass extinction
events and and a mass extinction event by itself is a little bit of an arbitrary um designation so it's
at least 75 percent of species going extinct within about two and a half three million years now why
that because those were the big ones that sort of stuck out it is arbitrary there are lots that are
fewer or lower proportion extinctions 50 40 35 in that range uh and the the time frame you know two
and a half three million years doesn't sound like it's a mass extinction that happens suddenly it's not
like the sort of the dinosaur bolide impact and the cretaceous but you know in geological speak
that's that's an eye blick so these are these are rapid extinction events yes they can take millions
of years now so there's a lot of smaller extinctions in fact probably well between somewhere between 20 and
40 depending on what sort of threshold you decide to use and they they occur quite regularly through through
the geological um history regularly as in their frequent or regularly as in they could be predicted
time wise time yeah we can't predict them that's the thing it's it's uh it's a very uh we people have
looked for patterns and and there are some suggestions perhaps some sort of cyclicity in the in the orbital
relationship in the solar system about our you know how far we are from the sun and various other things but
it's if there is anything going on it's it's um it's very minor compared to the randomness of these
events happening but how many of those 20 to 40 minor extinctions and the five big ones were related
to uh carbon pulses probably quite a few um i mean a lot of the early ones of course were only marine so
these were these were um lack of oxygen and and even temperature related uh changes in in chemistry
of the ocean uh and these are usually shallow seas where most of the the life was concentrated around
the edges of continental masses and so if you get these uh even subtle changes in atmospheric
concentrations of different gases and or changes in the saturation point of oxygen in the water you
can precipitate these huge die-offs that that can span the entire globe uh and we see the evidence
of that time and time again throughout the entire geological history so with that caveat um how
likely is it that we're headed for a minor or mass extinction in coming hundreds of years um given
what's built in yeah well this is some of our colleagues and i've argued quite strongly that we're
actually in this mass extinction now uh now have we achieved a 75 reduction from some previous baseline whether
that was you know the onset of the anthropocene and that isn't even really um well understood or at
least there's no um there's no agreement on when that might have happened but if we go back even to
the sort of the fertile crescent the development of agriculture and humans 12 000 years ago give or take
we took that time frame as a sort of a baseline we haven't achieved a 75 reduction in biodiversity that
is number of species or even other metrics of biodiversity for example the distinctiveness the
evolutionary distinctiveness of species but if you look at the extinction rates that happen between
these mass extinction events and again we can we can uh estimate those quite well from the fossil record
what we have even just what we've recorded not not taking into consideration the species that we miss because
many species of course have very small ranges they're very tiny they live in a very cryptic lifestyle
and most extinctions actually go unnoticed until well after they've occurred so even if we just look at
the ones that we definitely know gone extinct that we've observed we're looking at an extinction rate
that's about sort of an average of about a thousand times the rate that occurs between these mass extinction
events that's what we're in now and everything that we look at points the fact that it's perhaps even
larger than that so while we're not we haven't achieved that threshold yet we're on the way and
even more strikingly is that it's not going to happen in two and a half million years it's going
to be a century scale event so this is potentially the largest max mass extinction i'd say the the most
important or the the highest magnitude mass extinction event that has ever occurred on the in the history of
planet earth it's happening now we're in it but it'll take some time to precipitate fully
for for more reasons than than one it's also the high before this mass extinction began you know
let's just bookmark 20 000 years ago we were at the highest level of phylum genera species diversity
ever from the scientific record right yeah if you look at just total number of species that's true if
you look at phylogenetic diversity so the the the uniqueness the evolutionary uniqueness no actually
we achieved that in the cambrian so going back 540 million years ago so that we call that disparity
versus diversity so there was more evolutionary uniqueness and evolution is this kind of weird
things things pop out that that work for a while and then they don't seem to work as well as some
others and so they sort of drop off the scene and then other things come up for example the placoderms
the bone bone plated fish that are you know dunkelostes and and the you know those massive
bony plated armored fish that you see sometimes in museums or even in film uh they they just were gone
at the end of devonian and they never reappeared whereas things like coelacanths which are a very
ancient ancient fish lobe finned fish they managed to survive right through to today so some things
managed to to work and other things don't you know a lot of people think that evolution is this
process of constant sort of perfection and adaptation to some pinnacle or optimum it doesn't
work like that it's actually the opposite it's evolution is a penalty so if it works fine evolution's
not going to really screw with it but if it gives a slight disadvantage that's when it gets knocked on
the head and it might that form that particular form might never reappear again or it might form in
another different way for example the evolution of eyes that's happened in five or six different ways
through different groups of species that have absolutely no relationship to one another oh so
there wasn't an eye that evolved somewhere and then all the eyes after that came from that single
ancestor no it happened about four or five different times yeah wow that's kind of so there's lots of
examples of that um through through morphology now i'm not i'm not a paleontologist so i'm think i'm
talking a little bit outside of my area of expertise but i do work closely with a lot of paleontologists
i do know that blue eyes were uh epigenetic uh epigamic um which means sexual selection preferred
um mutation not that long ago and all the people in the world that have blue eyes did come from one
person who had blue eyes not that long ago yeah i'm not sure if this is correct but i i was under the
impression too that there was a link to neanderthal uh genes um associated with that also also ginger
hair so uh as it turns out i had my dna tested and i'm quite high on the neanderthals i am too
i am too neanderthal bros united yeah well it's funny cory actually means caveman in in scottish
so works really well yeah um so i'm going to talk a lot about extinctions and and biodiversity and
such but uh finishing this this intro to the topic of course the uh measurement and the impact and uh
the data on mass extinction and species both their population sizes and the number of species
are we going to do that in the world and the world is going to be able to impact them in a backloaded
fashion because while energy surplus has allowed us to expand around the planet and like you said
earlier the the places in the world that have their forests removed obviously are going to lose megafauna
and insects and birds and other things but what happens on the downslope of the carbon pulse if we have
to go back in an easter island sort of way and use forests for timber etc so you know we're impacting
climate and uh and habitat on the way up but we're also going to impact it on the way down so my fear
is that you know the animals that are very remote from human habitations will have a a reprieve but the
ones closer are are not especially the megafauna in africa in places that are near uh economically
poor areas i don't i don't see how they're going to survive i'm going a little off tangent but do you
have any opinions on that yeah no i i couldn't agree more that we we're looking at a series of you know
death by a thousand cuts in in many cases of the combination of a rapidly changing climate
but just the expansion of humans and their needs i mean even if we live in a completely uh
sort of eco-friendly way and have low very low per capita consumption and we live
in you know not in this consumptive um high consumption manner that we have today we completely
change the economic system or it's forced upon us by collapse then we're still there's still so many
of us and we still eat and we will still hunt and we will still take resources until they're gone and
then subsequently we will be of lower density i don't think humans are going to go extinct anytime soon
but there will be a point when there's the earth's carrying capacity and i think we've surpassed that
by by several decades already will no longer be able to support the numbers that are there so there will be
mass die-offs there'll be warfare um there'll be natural disasters and life per se per for a lot
of people will not be that pleasant so we'll regress to those sort of perhaps even neolithic kind of
times um that could be a century scale thing but it's unlikely just given our numerical dominance that
we'll go extinct right away but humans are a flash in the pan in an evolutionary sense anyway so
you know we're not here for a long time we're going to talk about some some dark things i suspect but
but let me throw in a little rainbow of sorts um you said that these mass extinctions um happened in
geological flashes of time over two or three million years and there were 20 to 40 of them so over 500
some million years um there were these very two to three million year periods of mass extinction and
yet up to 20 000 years ago or the neanderthals 40 000 years ago we had the the most biological diversity
ever on the planet so things do recover uh on earth including an abundance of flourishing of life um so
whatever happens in this six maths extinction well maybe not whatever happens there could be nuclear war
and and a whole lot of uh confluence of events but things will evolve and there will be new life
um maybe not complex life like dolphins apes and and humans but can you give us a a bright story um
before we talk about some of the other constraints yeah just given the complexity of life and the fact
that we've gone through these dips these huge dips in diversity over many many hundreds of millions
of years it it it it gives me actually a lot of comfort um ironically and i i will quote from paul
ehrlich here um who i just saw last week actually i i passed through california on my way back um back home
and he always says you know the planet's fine it's not in trouble life isn't in trouble humanity is
but life itself so after a mass extinction it opens up millions of new ecological niches that are
exploited through basically the trial and error of evolutionary change and so speed uh extinction
begets speciation we always see a the massive pulse and speciation and even the the rate of evolution
increases after a mass extinction event so life will persist until the sun explodes and wipes out
earth entirely from the solar system and that's several billion years down the track so we don't
have to worry about in the median immediate term but life will pretty much always persist on the planet
like you said will another sentient species emerge from that it's it's it's possible but i i tend to look at
um our big brains and our sentience as as merely at one of these disparity forms that have come out
that provide an interesting chapter in the history of life but aren't necessary for life to persist in
any sense whatsoever there's nothing nothing of high value that we can attribute to sentience per se
from a life perspective it's just it just happened and we're using it to our advantage but ultimately
to our disadvantage do you think there's other planets out there that have life and complex life
and oceans and biodiversity i think it's it's pretty much a statistical given that just the sheer
immensity of of our own galaxy let alone the entire universe that there's not some other form of life
out there would be almost infinitesimally a small probability and so being a numbers guy i i can't accept
the fact that there wouldn't be life is it in a microbial form or something analogous to that
is there complex ecosystems well uh i suspect there would be quite a an array of different
types of systems i suspect probably the most common form of life in the universe would be microbial
um and that probably in most cases wouldn't get much beyond that uh in some cases in the rare cases
you might actually getting ecosystems established and some sort of trophic relationships between different
species um whether there's the opportunity for this weird sentience experiment that evolution can
kick up uh is is entirely an open question i tend to think probably not but you know uh if you if you
if you went just on the probability i'd say that yes plenty of life out there but also on the same
probability framework um the massive distances preclude us ever from discovering it so if we do discover
life elsewhere um it'll be a big fluke and it'll only because it's next door in in a galactic sense yes
ethically i think we have to uh treat this planet as the only place that harbors uh complex sentient
life um because that is sacred i mean i'm i'm getting beyond the science but you know well we don't have
any evidence to the alternative yet so i mean if you're just playing the numbers of course it makes
sense but we haven't accepted one and that's the planet earth right um so let's dive into your work
you have a lot of your work looks at the impacts of um co-extinctions uh and the overall rate of
extinction and biodiversity i i don't know what a co-extinction is can you explain that and why it's
important and relevant well i'll take you back to um 2017 working with a colleague of mine giovanni
strona who's now at the joint research center of the eu he's based in italy obviously italian name
um good friend and and one of the best computational ecologists i've ever met well we were sort of
discussing a paper that had come out up saying um that tardigrades the the little you know uh water
bears the tunny the the multicellular obviously but if you've ever seen a photo of a tardigrade they're
the cutest little things they've got little claws and little round bodies like the michelin man and
there's many different species and they exploit a lot of um niches in the soil and and then a little
layer uh and there are immensely resilient little little little dudes they you can boil them you can
freeze them you can shoot them into space and they they just go into this little cocoon and they can
survive all sorts of extremes and so the point of this particular paper was that no matter what happens
on earth you know comet hits us or you know nuclear war whatever at least we're going to have tardigrades
because they physiologically they're this they're they're little juggernauts they're amazing little
things and second favorite creature on the planet for me um but i have to ask what the first thing
oh well velvet platypus velvet worms no they're they're the coolest they are the bridge between
the um the the true worms and arthropods and they have the coolest hunting technique on the planet what
they do is they they have two little siphons on the side of their mouths and when they they detect prey
they spit this kind of gluey mass and siphon it all out and just um just envelop their prey in this
gooey mess and then they just sort of suck it all in and eat the thing that's attached in the glue
there might yeah absolutely um i i now see why you like death metal yes weird things i like weird things
but you know i'm a classic geek scientist so there you go anyway okay water back to tardigrades yeah
tardigrades so we looked at this paper and went and as ecologists we said well that's all fine
you know they are resilient and if you take them out of the system and you can do stuff to them fine
but that's not actually how ecology works ecology works in the relationship to other species in the
system just as much as it does to the the physical environment the temperature the water availability the
so the food really is what drives ecological systems now you can be really resilient to extremes
and temperature and precipitation and so on and so forth but if you have nothing to eat you die
right it's pretty clear so everything eats something else or everything is related to something else
think of parasites and their hosts without the hosts there's the parasites can't survive you think of
flowering plants and their pollinators just a bee and a flower you know without the flower the bee
goes extinct and without the bee the flower goes extinct predators and prey you know you let your
cat out at night and it eats all the birds and the and maybe some rodents um without you know the prey
the predator dies and so there's all these relationships that exist and it gets more complex
than that there's a lot of different symbiosis you know plants growing on other plants and
and these these these hyper specialized relationships so if you look at a species in isolation or in
vacuum and you say okay it'll survive yet you fail to take into consideration all of its neighbors and
all the species in it interacts with then you're going to vastly underestimate what the total extinction
rate might be from some sort of disturbance so we call these dependencies in an extinction sense if one
goes extinct and then things depend on it no longer have that thing to depend upon then they will go
extinct too these are secondary or co-extinctions so you might have like a maybe this species was over
exploited maybe it was a prey species of something else and the predator over here goes oh i've got no
more food if it's specialized on this species that no longer exist it drops off the perch and that
can cascade throughout an entire system we have something called trophic webs people call them
food webs or food chains which is that's a simplification so you get thousands of species
in a community and they they'll interact either directly or through these chains of relationships
so one might eat something and then that's being eaten by something else and that's being eaten by
something else and so on and so forth so you can actually get this key species down here that a lot
of things depend on if it drops out then all these things some can rearrange some can can eat other
things but a lot of them are specialized so they drop out and then all the different relationships to
all those other species that that depend on it will then also precipitate these changes we use network
analyses we actually use the same computer techniques we do to analyze you know internet relationships we do
the same thing with ecological networks so i'm sure you've seen this uh short animated video which lizzie
will find and put in the show notes that i used at my uh at my class which showed a relationship between
ants and and plants and how there were certain ants for certain plants and sometimes they had seven or
eight others and then you saw if there was a little drop in the species of ants or plants there was not much of
an impact but the more of a drop then it cascaded through the ecosystem yeah and that's another term
we use extinction cascades and that's been known for quite a long time but we come let's come back to
tardigrades in this particular paper so what we did is we we actually developed uh these massive virtual
worlds of of interrelated you know virtual species so these we're talking computer games essentially
and we coded these large again it's models so they're simplified systems but we we try to get
something as ecologically realistic as possible and then we then what we did is after we established all
these different relationships we then took out species so first we did it sort of at random and
then we looked at these cascading effects through the system uh then we we we tried to play god a little
bit and we went sort of all evil and we we took the most important species from those ecosystems so
those are the ones with the most connections and then we took those out first we you know i would
assume those would be those would be really low on the trophic pyramid as in their food for a lot of
other things you can get um predators that actually have many different prey and they keep different
prey species um numerically in check so without the predator the prey go on to overshoot and destroy the
ecosystem exactly and then all these other things that depend on that ecosystem will die out too
so it's not necessarily the lowest trophic levels or the you know uh the ones that are being eaten by
everything else uh and it's true though that plants are a key component of these these systems so we'll
come back to plants later but then we uh we also did things like we then we took the next most important
and so on and so forth and then we heated up this system and we looked at thermal tolerances so how
much could you heat a species up until it died you know some species a little bit above their their
temperature range and they like turtles they die in instantly you weren't heating up the species you
were heating up the environment in which we were heating up our virtual earth yes yeah but we coded in
all of these different thermal tolerances because actually there's huge databases on what species what
type of species can handle both in terms of upper range and lower range so cold and hot ranges and once
they exceed that you know there can be behavioral adaptations there can be changes to their
distributions you know they can move latitudinally to get the most optimum range that's actually
what's happening but in if we heat the system up and say okay once you exceed this threshold you
you die uh or you you know we did a cooling one as well just just uh as a point of comparison
and what struck us was um two things when you don't account for the secondary extinctions if you just
look at what's causing the primary extinctions from the exceeding the thermal tolerance uh compared
to if you take into account the co-extinctions you can underestimate overall extinction rate by about 10
times in other words yeah you you have 10 times more extinctions than you would otherwise have just
from the primary extinctions so so most of our ecological climate system science is using too
narrow of boundaries um and not the precautionary principle everything is way way way more connected
than the common narrative yeah now that was a very theoretical sort of heating the planet to 20 plus
degrees or cooling it minus 20 degrees and seeing these massive changes but the the other striking
thing about that work was that when we took when we we played evil and tried to crash the system as
quickly as possible and compared that to the heating trajectory they were almost identical so if you
were to choose the disturbance that precipitated the most extinctions through extinction cascades
it would be heat heat it's not cold yeah so yeah it's it's quite depressing now that was a there
was a very big theoretical paper in terms of how we structured it but we then did a subsequent work
and we looked at heating over the coming century and we took a very um a much more ecologically realistic
virtual earth and we created yeah it was geographically explicit so we we covered the entire planet and and
we only looked at terrestrial to start with but we basically looked at within the time frame of
the century uh the the underestimate from primary extinctions is about 50 percent so just in that
with the next you know 70 80 years what's been predicted to go extinct by the end of the century
we're probably going to be at least double that predicted by who well predicted from the um the
thermal tolerances of just those primary extinctions so it's quite a bit of work because of the co-extinctions
and the the tardigrade effect that if that species is gone then there's the food web implications
so is is uh is there such a thing as the the inverse of that a positive a negative co-extinction
that a species disappears and it's better for uh the ecosystems well that's probably an open question
a lot of respects because well there's been some work on the the influence of invasive species
in potentially replacing ecological function in some of these systems so what i mean ecological function
let's say you lose a key predator and then some other species comes in and takes that role in that
ecosystem it could potentially replace that and and and save uh the the community from from that
co-extinction cascade uh but in most senses what we're seeing is quite the opposite so you add in
another species and even though it might replace some of the ecological function it's different enough
to actually cause more extinctions so we haven't actually seen evidence of that yet let's talk about
insects um i had a a butterfly specialist nick haddad uh from michigan state on and he gave some just
horrifying statistics on insects so lay it on us um cory what is the situation my understanding is that
we're losing insect biomass one to two percent a year and does that at some point play into your
co-extinction uh thesis have you looked at that well yes um and no uh the yes part is that uh from from
an ecological perspective once the insects go you're looking at a bottom-up effect so we're talking
bottom from the atrophic perspective who feeds on whom that you could precipitate a lot more
extinctions quickly actually it's and it's even below that the plants are probably even more important
because many of the most insects are herbivorous right so they're eating the plants and then things
eat those insects and so on and so forth so we as ecologists as the ecological community probably
never really expected that insects would be declining at the same rate as vertebrates
simply because they have high reproductive rates uh they you know one female can produce millions of
eggs in one clutch they have um they have adapted to almost every single niche you know the highest
diversity 50 of all animal species are beetles you know those kind of statistics that are just mind
boggling 50 of insect species or animals 50 of all animal species are one order of insect coleoptera which
are the beetles wow yeah it's it's i mean most most of the biomass or terrestrial biomass on the planet
is well plants then bacteria but then then invertebrates so most things most things are
insects on on on on the continental scale if you if you're not if you're just looking at animals well
in the insects we take them for granted like oxygen or or water but one to two percent a year if that
number is even in the ballpark you just you're a numbers guy that's 50 years and it's game over or less
and most of our ecological networks have pretty much ignored those lowest trophic levels the plants
and the insects so our 10 times um overestimation or underestimation of extinction rate is probably
being conservative because we haven't accounted for that insect and plant biomass change so it's much much
worse than even our worst case scenarios that that's kind of the point of this this conversation
and we never expected the the insects to be at the same sort of extinction uh rates that the
invertebrates are because of those life history traits that allow them to exploit these niches
quickly but we're seeing that now the problem is that we haven't been looking at insects as well as
everything else and the fact that they're so variable in time you can get a you know an explosion of
cicadas or something and then you know the next year there's none to to to be able to determine trends
with really variable data like that you need a lot of time and research money and and bodies and
equipment and all that and globally it's actually quite controversial the extent to which um insect
changes and reductions are happening but everywhere that people have looked well and it's only a handful
of places we're seeing these precipitous drops and you'll you know you hear a lot of anecdotal information
there's a lot of science still to be done in this area but the the signs are extremely worrying
let me let me ask you this well of course where i live uh in the midwest usa i remember 40 years
ago growing up you'd have to clean your windshields off driving around screen analogy is quite commonly
used yeah oh well it just because people remember it that i mean almost everyone you talk to notices
that and it there might be a lot of truth in that and it's just unfortunately we haven't actually
got the numbers associated with those anecdotal it's not science but with the science so the um
living planet index uh i think was a few years ago said that we've lost around 70 percent of the
populations of of animals um since the year 1970 globally um but that was really uh different based on
the area like north america is only like 25 latin america and south america and parts of asia were
70 percent in some places 90 percent what about insects but does it follow the same sort of numbers
or don't we know those are only vertebrates the living planet index only looks at vertebrates
and that's it it's major limitation um it's a very good index uh as you say it's so highly
spatially variable we have nothing like that for insects and people are doing a lot of
work to try to get to something like that but we we just that's a big unknown unfortunately uh it's
probably in that same sort of category of um in terms of reduction of individuals and that's really
what the living planet index is it's how many individuals in populations so so are you um as a
scientist who this isn't your core thing but numbers are do you feel confident that one to two percent
loss in insect biomass annually recently is is an adequate um description of what's going on
i i i think that's plausible uh i i think there would probably be high uncertainty around those
numbers and the other component about because of that rapid life history of many insects in many cases
they could potentially be driven to extremely low abundance and then rebound from those whereas that
would just knock out any vertebrate we don't really know what inbreeding depression um how that affects
a lot of insect species most of our work on genetics and inbreeding depression and that's basically
if you have a very small population the chances of you know having a sexual relationship with your
neighbor increases the the relationship between them because they they're probably going to be kin
and you know we know there's all sorts of jokes and movies and everything made about that uh mutiny
on the bounty same sort of thing post post-mutiny on the bounty there's inbreeding um it's not good
for species and we know what these inbreeding coefficients are for for many vertebrate species
and some species are extremely susceptible to it for example mammals and humans we we don't deal well with
inbreeding uh other things like sharks seem to be relatively resilient to them uh a lot of plants they
they can happily reproduce vegetatively or clonally for a long long time without no real observable
impact we don't know what happens with insects i'm gonna have to have you back um because we haven't
even gotten to the questions that i want to ask so i'm still going to keep asking other ones so there
are other kinds of extinctions right there's something called ecological extinction where
a species no longer plays the the functional role in its ecosystem even though we still have
you know a few hundred of of them i think there's 390 right whales left uh as an example but then i
wonder if there's a functional extinction where there might be 200 of these megafauna left so the species
exists but it's so genetically inbred i think uh cheetahs come to mind that at some point they don't
become healthy and and they're there's not a viable enough gene pool what what is the science that
that that's all called and is that relevant to our story yeah so this comes back to our inbreeding
um discussion but basically when you get down to very small numbers the the chance of inbreeding
increases dramatically and what that does is it tends to reduce your genetic diversity so how variable
your dna is across the entire chromosome and in itself it usually isn't a direct problem yes you can
get the expression of for example um what we call homozygous um alleles that have both a deleterious
effect and when they're expressed together they can create all sorts of diseases or they can you know
you might not grow a particular component of your body properly or you have a physiological um you
know you're missing an enzyme that's essential for for example uh digesting proteins or there's a
million different ways that can precipitate but more commonly inbreeding depression doesn't have that
direct what we call deleterious or lethal effect what it does is just by virtue of having reduced
variability and you cross your genome means that when things change there's less of a template to
or less or a smaller toolbox that you can then borrow from to to adapt to that change and i'm
talking on a generational scale not an individual life scale lifespan so if things change for example
climate and you're heating up and you have uh if you have a very healthy genome you're you're genetically
diverse in your population there's chances are that some of those individuals in there were going to
have the genetic capability to adapt their enzymes for example to deal with increasing heat and maybe
increase your thermal tolerance but when the population size is small and therefore your genetic diversity
is low you have fewer tools in your toolbox to deal with change and so that really is what drives these
long-term susceptibilities is that you you have even though things are getting worse you have less
adaptability it's a little bit like politics you know we have big more and more pop problems to deal
with but in across the world we're seeing the rise of conservatism and reduction of capacity to deal
with these mounting problems it's the same thing in genetics and the irony is in the word
conservatism is the is the word conserve so getting back to insects how important are pollinators and
what's the story there well you know there's been quite a bit of back of the envelope calculation of
of the value of pollinators just to our cropping systems for example 80 of all of our crops require
some form of animal pollination um and it's about 70 for all flowering plants and most of that is
from insects and in fact 50 percent of all of that pollination that occurs for our crops
is provided by one species apis mellifera the european honeybee without that species we would
probably lose at least a third of our food production couldn't couldn't we use drones or such
well they've they've actually tried that um and it's not very efficient uh as you can imagine if
you're dealing with small flowers on things uh it's it's extremely difficult to pollinate properly so
there have been estimates of what the the net value worth of pollination globally and it's in the trillions
of dollars annually and that's probably an underestimate because we couldn't even do what insects actually
do for us and and mainly bees so you know when you see things like um hive syndromes where you know
bees are are being reduced to very small numbers uh you get mites all sorts of things that compromise
bee production and you know in many parts of the world including the us um most much of the cropping
is due to the fact that people move around beehives and allow for that that pollination to occur without
that you would get you would reduce your total crop yields by massive amounts okay that is uh an
introduction uh i'm sure we could have talked a lot longer on the details of the various uh unfolding
extinctions or population declines in nature um but what's causing it what are the biggest driving
factors across the board on some of these issues that we've discussed you mentioned habitat loss with
forests what what else well the legacy of habitat loss basically from the expansion of mainly from
expansion of human agriculture so yes we we do also expand in terms of urbanization and just just
carving out a place to live but most of the damages occurred through the expansion of agriculture
and much of that has happened since the 1950s because that's that's been the massive pulse pulse we've
gone from you know 2 billion to over 8 billion in that time frame and so just the increase in the
amount of land required to feed us has has caused most of those extinctions in the terrestrial realm
obviously uh but we've also had and and that's probably the more proximate um cause of most extinctions but
of course we have over exploitation uh that just basically over hunting so you take your bison example or your
your passenger pigeon or your great orc you know there's many many examples of massive over hunting
great orc i didn't think those were real no the great orc no sorry it's my accent a uk uh a uk what
is that like a big cow no no it's it was a large seabird um that were that populated most of the north
atlantic and it was over hunted for mainly for its eggs um and partially for the the adult birds and its
meat um and this is actually a really interesting story because while it was really widespread and and
not susceptible to you know small perturbations around here and there across its range it got to such
a small number and the last colony was on a little islet off of iceland and that eyelid blew up in a volcanic
explosion and that was the end of the species um that that one explosion was the the the ultimate cause of its extinction
but the reason it went extinct is because its entire range had been had been reduced
uh so anyway back to we're saying uh the these extinct over exploitation invasive species is probably
one of the biggest contributors today and that is via changing the dynamics of these systems so they come
in and they eat things they also out compete things they change soil chemistry they completely
restructure communities and for example lakes and rivers could you give an example a modern example
of an invasive species that had a deleterious effect on the existing species well i'll give you a great
example from australia um we we introduced cats and foxes to australia um some 200 and so years ago
and cats when they were released here went sort of woohoo and spread to all parts of the continent
and they are the principal driver for the highest mammalian extinction rate of any country in the
world yes australia is number one we have the highest rate of mammal extinctions globally and it
was mainly because of cats are they you mean they're living in people's houses or these are these are feral
cats these are yeah cats that have gone for also people in people's houses but mainly they're wild you
know what we call feral so they've been released and they've gone wild so they kill mammals everything
as well as birds presumably yeah birds as well we have a lot of threatened birds because of
but the main effect has been small marsupials small marsupial mammals um foxes to a lesser extent
but then we also have things like rabbits that have destroyed soil chemistry and and topsoil erosion
across the country we have carp that have invaded our freshwater systems and we don't have a lot of
freshwater in australia and they've completely changed those ecosystems and and precipitated
extinctions of other fish species um just by their sheer abundance not just their predation
uh we have you know weed species that have overtaken vast tracts of of forest and they choke out native
species so they dig the list goes on and on and on but this happened before humans there were i i suppose
the speed at which new species could be introduced uh came on boats with humans there were stowaway rats or
whatever else but but these bursts of invasive species also happened before humans yes true yes i
mean we we call them tend to call them vagrants instead of invasive species per se just that's i
guess just the lexicon but things would be blown off track you know a flying bird and managed to establish
a small population somewhere but he obviously takes more than one usually get back to that inbreeding
conversation we had earlier but most of it is through commerce most of the of the transplanted species
are through commerce through shipping through airplanes through just people walking um driving
and you can get invasive species even within the same country one side of the country will have a
completely different biota than the other side and people will exchange those and that can cause
massive disruptions in those very delicate systems globally invasive species cost our economies
about 1.5 trillion dollars annually that's just the economics we're not even talking about how much
do our economies cost the other species exactly but just just to show you that we we also do a lot
of work on the economics of invasive species and there are a massive drain on our global uh economic
systems as well okay habitat loss over exploitation invasive species um and now climate change and now
climate change of all of all of those and climate change is already precipitating extinctions
um climate change is overtaking all of that so even at even at one and a half degrees celsius
only only oh yeah well one and a half is a pipe dream now we're looking at more like two
to four by the end of the century now this is the most realistic um projections so and at one point
and i i well we could pick a number because like like you said on on the co-extinction and the vertical
and horizontal relationships with everything no one has a freaking clue let's just say that we stop at
three degrees celsius what does that just that number let's speculate that that's where it stops
uh you know could be two could be four we don't know um paint us a picture of what that means to
the other non-human species on the planet uh in a few minutes well again without trying to get too
predictive about proportions or anything we're probably looking at least half of species on the
planet going extinct within the time frame that's affected by that change uh if we literally degrees
celsius yeah yeah um in the past it was sort of predicted to be more like in the 10 15 range but now
given that understanding of co-extinctions it's probably well above that so i i would say 50 would
probably be in the in the right area do do does the average climate scientist who's looking at
glacier melting and arctic ice and other things do they understand what what you just told me
from an extinction perspective probably not but i think most climate scientists are um shitting the
dax basically that that we we every time we come close to uh understanding a projection we we we exceed it
and so if you look at the predictions back in the early 90s to where we are today we've exceeded
everything uh we're seeing these increase in pulses i mean the what was it um sunday was the
hottest day on the planet ever uh this sunday and then monday was the hottest uh thereafter so
we we're still being blown away by how conservative our models have been and that's partially politics
and we can get into that about you know the ipcc and and the fact that we've downplayed the severity
of this because it's not politically palatable for most people um even the language that the ipcc
uses in its reporting it reduces the certainty with which we report these changes so most scientists you
know they have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning when they understand the gravity or
the extent and the magnitude of these changes that are happening in their own lifetimes
so we we're a depressed bunch um yeah let me talk about that for a second cory um
i host this podcast so i know these things you obviously are a ecological researcher you you you work on
this every day but especially for um lay people around the world listening to this podcast
this episode this can be a freaking gut punch i mean it is it is a slow unfolding tragedy horror movie
how do you cope with that and and keep your jovial attitude and i mean at some point is this helpful to
tell people what's going on 50 of species if we are at three degrees celsius plus a whole lot of asterisk
and and other unknowns i think we have to communicate this is our world our planet and yet to some people
this is almost too much to bear and i'm i'm borderline one of them to be honest yeah and it's a perfectly
normal response and uh the ability to deal with change that you are incapable of altering that's the
other component and there's there's actually an entire branch of psychology devoted to this we can
get into in a little bit but well basically the the the idea is that it's it comes back to uh and
specker's book back in the um in the 1970s it won the booker prize on the um the uh basically the idea that
people deny their death it was called the denial of death and how as an individual you have aspirations
you have dreams you have um uh you enjoy life you you raise families you have most people have this
positive outlook on and achieving something yet for all that to disappear because you die because
we all die and so we have this we built in psychological denial of death and that's why death is so
such a scary topic for most people but now now let's magnify that to planetary death or at least
death of life so we can't even handle it on an individual level so so our little brains really can't
handle the severity of the the loss of life at this scale so we become even more denialist and in fact
it's cognitive dissonance it is it's a complete cognitive and it's for it's for our mental health that
we do this so i don't blame people for putting the head in the sand and and as a parent too in fact
parents are the worst culprits because you know no matter what you do invest in your children you you
make sure that they eat well you you invest in their education you teach them about life and for all
that to mean nothing that they're going to still be facing these horrors in their lifetime is almost
inconceivable in the head of a parent that there's nothing you can do to give your kids a leg
up yes there's some buffering from wealth and from education but everyone's susceptible so that that
cognitive distance is even magnified from most parents perspective so you translate that to an
entire population you can see why people are ignoring what's going on and don't want to hear
the story no matter how much we beat our drums and say look it's bad we have to tell the story but we also
have to realize that people's reaction isn't going to be right we best do something then because
that's not how people respond normally and i guess that's given me a lot of it's turned my frustration
into at least an understanding of our own behavioral responses to emergency and yes you can sugarcoat
things and you can tell them that you know if we do x it'll be maybe not as bad and that that's actually
become my philosophy if i can if i get out of bed in the morning and and the work i do even changes
one small thing for the better i say the future is going to be shitty but maybe i can make it just a
little less shitty and that's kind of my philosophy of life now and you have to accept that it's going
to be catastrophic but how big of a catastrophe are we talking maybe we can limit it's damage to some
extent and once you accept that it's actually easier to do your work and to be not depressed
about it i mean still depressing don't get me wrong i've had a lot of therapy um i do a lot of exercise
and martial arts to you know as that's my yoga you know it's just yoga with violence um i listen to
death metal i mean these are my escapisms i make wine you know i i have my i enjoy my family i have my
little dogs you know i i do enjoy life uh so that keeps me functioning as a human being but i have to
face this every single day regardless let me ask you this uh you were interested in animals and biology
and ecology you told us your academic history i'm sure when you started out at a as a bright-eyed bushy
tailed non-tattooed 20 year old that um you were just interested in the science and and the wonder
and beauty of it all but at some point between then and now you understood the sixth mass extinction
and the you know three degrees celsius plus or minus even if it's two degrees um it's a huge deal for
other species right so you so this is unfolded during your own intellectual and emotional journey
yeah actually when i started out in academia i really did not like conservation biology or even
conservation biologists i thought they were sort of the fringe of science and that they uh these
people were sort of um worried for nothing and that the the real science was more the empirical stuff
and you know i was i was very much into all that but the more i started looking into it the more i
realized how wrong i was and that that was more probably one of the most important sciences that we
could possibly do and that's what drew me into that and then the more i mean yes i'm applying
the mathematics and i still enjoy the empirical aspects of it the scientific components that's
that's really my passion but you can't help but be affected by that mentally and emotionally
it's impossible because we're like ambulance you know paramedics we see death and destruction
and maiming and injury and suffering every single day and you talk to your average paramedic and you
know they have a hard time mentally dealing with that every single day you know post-traumatic stress
disorder from from military people you know it's there's many different professions that have this
kind of response and we're just one of those so uh we've talked about animal extinctions some mass
extinctions i want to talk about uh human uh population levels and and the impact of that and also policy but
let me ask you a difficult question uh put you on the spot um just because i'm curious as to your
philosophy on this if you could push a button and every human in the world could understand what you do
about animal uh insect uh wild populations and climate change and what climate change is going to do to
those would you push that button or not everyone would understand that's what the button would do
yeah it would understand you couldn't affect their caring that would be another another button but
everyone would understand it like oh i believe this is the case yeah absolutely i think in you know
information is nothing but an advantage it's how you deal with that information is is becomes the
moral and ethical components education i'm not sure i would press it i would press it for those
people that have levers of power i don't know if the average person benefits from hearing this story
i i'm open-minded to it but i i i'm not sure because people are already at wit's end with all their
worries and and everything else going on and no i do i do see your point and i can certainly understand
that some people wouldn't be mentally capable of dealing with that but i think the the advantages
would outweigh the disadvantages overall i think if people actually understood and especially their
their particular relationship their lifestyle relationship to healthy ecosystems and why we
can breathe and why we're happy and why we can make money and and why we can travel and why we can
see beautiful and appreciate beautiful things art being one of them that's you know art it comes from
natural systems that's why we embrace it if that understanding was there that we can see the link to our
our own well-being i think that would precipitate a lot more action so i yes i agree some people would
be in desperation but i think overall it would be a net benefit so so moving on to um global human
population you've also written on this you had a review paper come out in march of this year yeah and
in that you looked at the united nations uh model projections that said that human population is
expected to peak at 10 billion people sometime this number uh 25 increase from the current 8 billion
based on your systems ecology work how likely do you think that is well you know even if you look at
the a lot of people have been working on this if you look at the sort of demographic consensus
that really is right in sort of the the best information that we have and even even if we
went through and i've done this is previous work even if we go through a massive war and even if we
have you know child mortality double over the over the next century or so even if there are three or
four major pandemics that make covid look like the common cold it won't even affect the trajectory and and
that's the thing we have this massive demographic why is that well there's just so many of us and the
fact that you we we're still increasing at the our fertility rates but not but are you our fertility
rate peaked in 1965 it peaked in globally yes but if you look at many other nations like for example
nigeria where it's tracking at five to seven uh children per female and much of yes south america
south southern sort of latin america has reduced south asia has reduced a lot but but mainly that
sort of middle east um sub-saharan africa area is still massively increasing so globally we're again
it's changes by region but globally we're locked into increases at least till the end of the century
i would say that the best case scenario is that we i disagree with that i disagree with that and i'll
tell you why in a second but go on okay well i mean all the models point to that and regardless
of what we do the models include uh a proper accounting of the carbon pulse and how oil
especially and natural gas underpin our actual food system do the models include many of the countries
you mentioned and here i'm arguing with an expert i'm just throwing out some things yeah no i see what
the models include the fact that the the wide boundary implications of climate which you just
said at three degrees celsius is gonna uh eliminate fifty percent of of the species what about countries
like nigeria and saudi arabia that have high growth rates under a three i mean how are they gonna how's
that gonna work okay well i'll give you i'll give you an a a good response to that that i think will
explain this simply the number one predictor of female fertility on the planet and this is work where we've done
what do you think it is uh i'm talking on a national scale
lack of education nope income nope
religion nope not even close okay i would have thought that myself with the number one predictor is
child mortality so the higher the child mortality the higher the the number of kids the fertility
rate increases precipitately it's not even linear it's actually a threshold effect so getting it
around uh i think it's about 0.03 child mortality there's a huge spike in female fertility and that's
the insurance policy effect if my child has a high
not even be a social conscious thing that's just a biological reaction exactly so as ironically as
our child children die faster and i'm doing a lot of work on child mortality and child health and as it
relates to both demography and climate change and all those things are peaking yes we've hit a plateau
but now they're starting to go up again um the the ironic thing is that as you kill children
people's fertility is increase and you see a regression back to that that demographic change
that that people change uh through the development cycle
and this demographic transition will go backwards so we if anything we're going to see increasing rates
of human population growth closer to these extreme events and that will eventually equilibrate
because you know your carrying capacity is lower and your your overall mortality rates will be higher
but people will compensate overcompensate for that just by fertility alone so we're gonna we're gonna go
to 10 billion uh much poor much poorer humans than the average today i expect you think too that you
know from a demographic perspective and i do a lot of work on you know reducing invasive species and we
try to kill populations like cats on islands and we just did a project on pigs on kangaroo island here in
south australia and we try to maximize the way we can kill these populations to remove them from very
ecologically sensitive areas and if you get a demography like humans the the quickest way to do that
is to target young reproductive females in other words those are the those are the individuals that
count from a demographic perspective males are irrelevant and so are people beyond their reproductive
uh years so you don't have to kill um every i mean basically if if you have a massive mortality event
but you're still keeping the core of that young fertile female intact that's what drives populations
all the other stuff is kind of demographically peripheral that that's a very empirical way of
saying that you know um we have this system where females are driving the demography and that's always
been the case just based on our biology uh so if if that component is maintained even over a short
period like if you manage to survive from say the ages of 14 to 25 or even 30 you most of your
reproductive lifespan is that is encompassed by that period so if you die thereafter not a problem from a
demographic perspective your population will still grow your age structure will change yes but your overall
trajectory won't so had we just started the interview now i would have two hours of questions
um yeah this opens up a huge area well let's start here and then backtrack um if we had a reality
roundtable right now with you and elon musk he's saying kind of the exact opposite that the human system
needs more babies otherwise we're going to implode um what is your response to that that's exactly what a
ceo would say in our economic system the number of consumers increases his profit margins and that's
the only thing there is if you look at all the evidence for how population affects average well-being
of the individual in every single case more people equals a lower um a lower well-being we have housing
crisis we have transport crises we have political crises we have refugees moving in that increases
people's perception of their jobs being stolen that their resources are being taken so we have an
uptake in extremist politics we have um we have school issues you know the number of schools being
built we have infrastructure problems we have expansion of agriculture and then precipitating
more extinctions every single element you look at in terms of human higher human population densities
in terms of disease and children in terms of um uh the availability of food and the distribution of
wealth every single one of them reduces average well-being the only thing it increases is profit
margins in a completely capitalist society that's it well it increases the market the market needs babies
to buy diapers then toys then teachers when a ceo of a corporation tells you they need more people
because it's good for society it's good for them and that's it until until we're at a three degrees
world with half of the species including pollinators gone there are no profits no that's exactly right
so it's a short-term response but the best thing we can do to increase the well-being of people on the
planet today is to reduce our densities that you know if you look at all the the highest uh well-being
indices in almost every country in the world the places with the highest well-being indices are
those with the lowest population densities so you said reduce our densities is that um meaningfully
different than reduce our populations all that means is that we should basically impart large-scale
culturally appropriate non-coercive family planning globally and that we should open up our immigration
policies to include people that can work to to provide for example the labor shortages it's an easy
problem that's an immigration problem it's not a fertility problem it's a it's a choice countries
make um you know you look places like japan places like italy that have declining populations
japan japan's case in particular that's mainly because of their immigration policies they don't allow
people to come in to take up those those those labor shortages we do it in australia as well and in
japan jeremy grantham was on the show and he said people aren't interested in having sex anymore as as
one well look in australia if you took out the immigration component we would be just at replacement
right now so placement is like 2.1 babies yeah 2.1 ish yeah yeah but we're growing at one percent per
annum that's that's net immigration one percent people per annum yes yep that's our population
right now is growing at that rate and that's almost entirely immigration i think the number i looked 10
years ago if you take the um the the deaths and if you take the births and subtract the deaths
10 years ago it was like 85 million net new human babies per year i think it's down to 81 million
yeah per year or something like that that's correct yeah yeah so we we've entered a new phase in fact
we entered that phase in the early 60s where um and this is work that we have ongoing at the moment
that shows that we went from a what we call a these are technical terms and i'll try to explain them
well from a depensation phase to a compensation phase now let me explain what that means depensation
and population dynamics means that when you add individuals to a population the average fertility
or the average rate of increase also increases so this is the idea of a minimum number of people that
society needs to function well right beyond a certain point the per capita competition
it starts to kick in and therefore every subsequent increment in population size actually decreases
population growth that's because there is no more facilitation component to adding more people more
people is a net detriment because actually fertility ends up declining we've passed that phase in 1962
and ever since then the entire globe has been on this downward track trajectory that more people added
lower population growth rate such that even if you if you extend that out to the to zero
growth i.e stability that still puts us in the range of about 10 billion people by 2080 end of the century
does this rhyme or track with other species as well i i assume this is pretty much the the standard
amongst all species the only difference is that in humans we've artificially inflated our carrying
capacity through technological innovation over the course of our because of fossil fuels i would say
mainly because of fossil fuels yeah if you also look at that that transition from depensation to
compensation that pretty much was contemporaneous with this transition from using more than one
earth per year in terms of the global ecological footprint so we transitioned to net users of resources as
as opposed to net replaces so now we're we're operating at the sort of uh i think what's the average about
two earths per year um we're taking about double what we could possibly replace and it's up to you know
six times in the u.s that's just the the daily and annual flows that assumes away the the
ancient sunlight and minerals that we're adding yeah yeah so so let me um here here's a very salient
question in discussions today uh for those people who are very aware and concerned about global heating
uh and understand the global economic juggernaut what is the proportion uh uh impact of of uh population
growth on climate change in comparison to just the consumption of existing populations how would you break
out uh the impact on on climate and emissions between uh those two but uh about 80 percent of our total
emissions contribution to heating is from increasing population 20 from increasing consumption
so you add the uh because that's the other thing people don't tend to realize is that
the average per capita consumption rate globally has doubled since 1970 pretty much so not only have
we increased by fourfold almost well threefold since then but the average per capita rate of
consumption is doubled so not only are there many more people but on average we're using twice as
many resources per person so it's not the opposite and so when you look at the contribution to warming and
we've done this relationship um about 80 percent is due simply to the number of people
because it's um it's growing at a much faster rate compared to actual per capita consumption rates
it's quite striking um that that uh i can provide that paper to you at some point if your listeners
are interested yeah we'll put it we'll put it in the show notes yeah um so i assume that if we are headed
and you you were pretty confident that barring a nuclear war um you know including pandemics and wars and
famines and stock market collapses or whatever else that we are headed to 10 billion because of the momentum
that you described so what would be the environmental impact if if we continue to have the same levels
of resource consumption per capita with you know energy water agricultural impacts at 10 billion that
we have at 8 billion obviously i've answered my own question i think you have uh yeah it's not a rosy
picture put it that way i we're getting into the realms of you know trying to predict proportions and
percentages and things like that are quite difficult but the the i guess to encapsulate or summarize
this there isn't a single metric that we can see today that's in the right direction in other words
all of these things are conspiring to go exactly the opposite that we want them to or that they should
be going and that means that all of these complex interactions will multiply and cause these
unforeseen outcomes that we can't possibly predict even with a very you know complex model because
these are these emergent these are basically this is you know um the butterfly effect in complex adaptive
systems we have these interacting elements that will interact in such complex ways that it's difficult
to see how there will be anything but magnifying the predicted extent of the damage that we will
see by the end of the century or beyond so i i don't like i said it's hard for me to see any way
out no matter what we do there there's it's almost to the point now that what you accept again coming
out to my sort of mantra you accept that the the future will be terrible but you can perhaps make it a
little bit less terrible for some people and that doesn't mean you should hoard resources and exclude
everyone sort of like the the extremist right-wing politic uh approach to things but it does mean
that that solutions need to be of sufficient magnitude that they address certain things like
for example food wastage you know that seems like a very a very small thing but you know if we manage to
eradicate food wastage or at least reduce it substantially we would need we wouldn't need the
agricultural expansion that our growing populations will demand quite quite to the same extent so
we'll have fewer extinctions as a result so that's a good thing it doesn't mean people won't suffer it
just means that we'll have a slightly less catastrophic um outcome so what what are the policies that um
could make a difference in this and by the way here's here's my view on on population um i think
there well you just told me the facts it's 80 percent due to population numbers and 20 percent due to
consumption obviously i think uh the wealthier nations should use less um and we probably shouldn't
have as many uh um people having babies worldwide but i of the of the three timelines that i talk about
pre-crisis bend versus break and a more uh stable state in 2030 50 years from now i think population
the discussion of population isn't going to happen in the in the near term and if it did if we stopped
having babies worldwide for whatever reason that would precipitate the financial um overhang and and
wars over resources etc because it we it's it's been a a musical chair ponzi scheme the the
financial representations of biophysical reality so i i think climate change is hard enough to convey to
people the population story you've told is is another order of magnitude harder true but if if you take
that perspective of and i'll quote you stopping having babies that's not actually what what one should
advocate at all i think a family planning so that you manage your family size to a a point that is
acceptable to you as a human human as an individual but also takes into consideration the legacy effects
so if you recycle if you don't do overseas trips if you buy an electric car if you hang your clothes out
to dry instead of using the dryer you eat vegetarian blah blah blah all the things one individual can do
the effect on your emissions are an order of magnitude lower than having to deciding to have one fewer
children in your family so zero instead of one one instead of two two instead of three it's exactly if if
if we had a policy for example say two is great more than two maybe we want to think about that it
doesn't preclude people from fulfilling that evolutionary need to reproduce which we all have
i mean that dictates all of human behavior basically we're not saying people don't have babies we're
just saying think about how you how the kind of life you can give to your children and part of this
is is reducing child mortality you know there's there's an ulterior motive there because it does
reduce fertility it's the strongest effect in reducing uh female fertility and having the ability to make
those decisions on the family level for both men and women that's essential so and it has to be
done culturally appropriately it has to be done in in a non-coercive way it has to be ethically
um acceptable it's not there's no one-size-fits-all it has to be done globally doesn't it it has to be
done globally but it's a it's a sort of a tailor-made approach that's what family planning is about
per region and it considers all of the other components that religion in the society the economic
development level or the the cultural components um belief systems various other things and there
are plenty of examples where it's worked very well without being an imposition and you know middle-aged
white blokes like myself living in rich countries aren't saying you should stop reading because
that's not what we're saying at all uh we're saying that we need family planning so 2.1 maybe you
could briefly explain why 2.1 children per female is the replacement rate globally if if you will get
married and you have 2.1 children and everyone did that that the population would stay the same is that
correct yes well that accounts for both the fact that you're going to have female and male children
males don't reproduce per se they don't produce babies they produce sperm so you can only have as
many babies as there are a number of women right and until men start getting pregnant that's not going to
change uh and then the small 0.1 there accounts for the global mortality rates in children okay and
what is is 2.1 would be uh even what is the what is the number now the fertility rate globally globally
it is if i recall about
2.8 2.9 somewhere in that vicinity yeah so it has been declining globally but it's still
high enough that we won't make that transition in most countries um until quite later down down the
track so how important is education um especially for women and can education uh trump or overcome the
financial market economic imperative that drives our society
yes well this is a little bit problematic for for several reasons because it's it emancipation of
women's rights and giving people the economic freedom to make decisions in their life and and not be
coerced and be in control of their own bodies um and and improving their own well-being both
economically and otherwise through education these are all grand things you know you make better informed
decisions generally speaking your family members have better lives there's less suffering um and you
have more freedom and you experience more of life and so these are all great things the the flip side of
course is that when you increase your economic standing you increase your consumption rate
so that's partially imposed by the economic systems that we have um so that there's it's it's almost
imposed that you increase your consumption as your education and therefore and your
per capita wealth increases you you there's a great example of that in in in terms of refugees when
refugees come from low consumption countries on average and they move to high consumption countries
they adopt the same consumption rates of the high consumption country their host country within a few
months and this happens globally so it's it's imposed by the system you can't even choose not to be a
consumer when you move to these countries because that's the system that's there and if you have if you
have more means you have you end up spending more it's designed to make you spend money and therefore
consume so it's it's it's a it's a it's a multi-level problem and there is a very again a complex set of
systems but it's it come fundamentally comes down giving people the choice to make their own decisions and
that education is essential component of that and that's incorporated into the best practice family
planning programs that are available and and access to birth control um that is widely freely i assume
is a big part of it it's more than just access because access alone will not shift fertility per
se it has to be accompanied by actual education family planning programs and that's a huge cultural
component to that as well okay so here is a um uh an oft stated assertion i'd like your opinion on it
um if people understand our ecological uh brink and understand the scientific uh thesis you've
outlined here and they realize that globally we should um continue our evolutionary imperative of
having children and doing the acts that cause having children but uh 2.1 global average is is the more
sustainable uh um outcome number those people around the world that are equal it and have a value system
that care about future generations in the biosphere will actually choose to do that whereas the people
who don't have a value system about dolphins oceans and a livable earth might have six kids um so how how's
i hear that a lot what are your responses to that uh framing yeah well i guess part of the educational
component is just showing the net benefits of smaller families for those people and and that the average
well-being per per individual in the family it actually comes right down to that that if people
realize that you know a very crowded house has fewer diseases for children for example there's fewer
hospital trips there's less competition among siblings there's usually a better part of resources
available for the extracurricular activities of the children in the family and the list goes on and
on and on they have a better quality food uh so except except let me ask you this so you said earlier
there was a biological imperative um that if there's low fertility rates that results in more babies what
if we go from 50 to 100 years of economic growth to the backside of the carbon pulse there will be an
economic equivalent of low mortality the it's low economic vitality that doesn't that could that imply
the the impulse to have more children to support you as you get older and such well if we also have
simultaneously uh we're focused on reducing child mortality in those situations so while you might
not have a lot but if you focused on preventing and most child mortality occurs in the first year of
life right if we really put the emphasis on child health and the the raising of children to that age
you would have less of an impetus to invoke that subconscious insurance policy in terms of fertility
so i i you can't you you'd have to do both so we're we're in a mess um but what you're telling
me is of all the things that we could do to improve the odds of uh avoiding a ghastly future that um
reducing infant mortality is one of them that's a big one i'd say probably the next biggest thing is
a complete restructure of the economic system in which we work and and that's that's a big ask
because um it's it's air it's it's tendrils have penetrated every orifice of every component of
society so it's not something that it's a quick fix i personally think the worst invention that humans
ever came up with it wasn't nuclear bombs and it wasn't you know chemical warfare it was actually
in corporatization so the creation of companies and public companies companies going public so that
you outsource the ownership to people that aren't making the decisions you divorce ethical decision
making from profit maximization and so i think the worst thing that ever occurred is the creation of a
stock market that one brilliant idea provided the template for the destruction of the planet and that
to me was the when it really started because there's no way that you can incorporate good human decision
making that's morally environmentally ethical when your decision makers have nothing to do with those
decisions all they want is the bottom line i don't know how much you know of my work corey
but one of the lines in my movie and and i say it often is we've outsourced our wisdom and
decision making to the market exactly so i i think we're on the same page there this that another
thing we could do is we could make all political donations illegal because there isn't a single
democracy on this planet it's all shades of a plutocracy and as soon as you can buy decision
making for mac profit maximization then again you have the same effect you do you have decisions that
are for the few and not for the many and that includes a societal well-being and so those three
things alone reducing child mortality getting rid of public companies and making political donations
illegal would make a huge dent in reducing how shitty our shitty future is going to be
what kind of changes have you made in your own life in your personal life being uh aware of these
things to be more aligned uh with the future you'd like to see or do you think individual choices are
not relevant in the in the scale and scope of what you're describing individual choices are relevant i
think um but they they have to be gauged relative to these you know the scale effects obviously so i think
if i was you know traveling overseas every second day and and i were i had 16 children and i was
you know embraced in all sorts of uh consumerism that i could possibly think of
if i managed to say for example make political donations illegal it would sort of dwarf all of
those negative effects right so you want to be a net positive for the planet exactly but at the same
time those personal choices are really important not just for you know i'm a hypocrite like all
humans i'm alive so i'm a hypocrite you know it's the i like that old meme it's very old now is you
know the woman holding a sign at a rally and it said save the planet kill yourself that's a bit of an
extreme but fundamentally she's right uh so you know just being alive you consume right so there are choices
to to yes i as an academic i fly overseas and that's that's bad um i i have a car that's bad
public transport isn't available i live on a farm one of the reasons i bought the farmers to produce
more food so i would rely less on you know importing food from elsewhere i like my wine so i make it
myself you know i made choices i have one child you had two choices of buying the farm you bought the real
farm instead of buying the farm yes exactly but you know i have one child um i try to limit my
consumption i eat locally um i you know there's there's small things i can do but you know from
as an individual you know i support the the parties with policies i think that's one of my biggest
uh influences is my vote and in australia you you are obliged to vote we you don't have a choice
so that's a good thing is there um you know like climate change probably even more than climate
change natalism and and overpopulation is a very heated um and uh uh contentious topic that doesn't
make it into the national stage because it's very threatening talk about cognitive dissonance have you
seen any change in that in your lifetime of studying these things well i i mean the first population
paper i ever wrote i received death threats quite regularly from that um biggest hate mail campaign
i've ever received as soon as you start talking about human reproductive rights it gets very heated very
quickly and that's wrapped up into culture and religion and all sorts of things politics so that comes with
it what you know some of the bigger changes i've seen in my in my life um the for development agencies
in the united nations uh which were very active in family planning right up until the 90s um and
then a massive shift happened where the catholic church actually got involved and um it became
basically anathema to even mention the word family planning thereafter and that still has an effect
and even today when we deal with development agencies in the united nations one of my colleagues
was just at one of the united nations meetings and they're they're actually the united nations
precludes their employees from even mentioning it so it's a policy that is starting to break down
because there's a lot of people in so-called lower income countries that are you know well-educated and
are seeing the benefits or at least seeing the detriments of of high populations in their countries
are starting to say look this isn't just white people in rich countries from the west telling
you know dark people in low-income countries in in the south how to do business because we actually
can benefit from this so we're working with a lot of local people now that's starting to come out in
the conversation but it's a very it's still very heated even in the development circles and these are
very uh educated and and ethically and morally upstanding people that that really want to
better the world but even their politics are so tight around this subject that it's almost impossible
to get them to speak about it publicly let alone privately so we still have a lot of work there
definitely what's the um what's your best speculation at a sustainable human population over the long term
that's a very interesting question there's been a lot of work done on that over the years
uh from today from an ecological footprint perspective from a demographic momentum from
from a well-being perspective and from an over consumption perspective all things are kind of
pointing into that two to three billion range perhaps slightly more perhaps slightly less which was
approximately what we were back in the 50s uh just before the well just as the baby boom was taking off
so if we managed to get us globally again that's highly geographically variable um because some places
are have higher productivity than others but on average globally if we sort of stuck to that kind of
number that would be a good target it would certainly provide adequate consumers for markets to be more or less
free with some limitations of course um it would give people a very good lifestyle and benefit um and
well-being our health would be better uh our long-term food production would be more sustainable we would
be able to reel in a lot of that climate change momentum and perhaps even fix it we'd even be able to
restore a lot of ecosystems uh but will we come to that by design or by disaster i tend to think the latter
um rather than a planned uh sort of target that's my base case too that we continue to grow population
for another 30 years or so and then there's a gig of famine in the in the back half of of the century
but um rex weiler has been on the program he was one of the co-founders of greenpeace and he did the
math with me and like we said we're growing 80 million net new humans per year so that's 800 million
per decade but if we did what you said earlier a campaign on education uh especially of women
family planning education access to free contraceptives that you could reverse that
and go to a negative 1.1 percent per year which actually works out to around 800 million
per year with no draconian early deaths or famine or wars or anything so in you know 30 40 50 years
if that were true we could be at 2 billion uh in theory yeah i think actually if i if i looked at
some of the reduction it would put us probably more like the middle of next century that would be viable
to to reach some of those numbers but yeah we're talking about the same i mean the next entry is
is like a fantasy sci-fi novel i mean i don't even know what 2030 is gonna be exactly yeah no i but
but yes that is the time frames are sort of in the hundred year range that we could possibly do that
yeah okay if if it were designed i feel more like you though that um a lot of that will be imposed
yeah and not in a nice way well you're not the first to suggest that on this show um i don't think
no definitely not this has been uh eye-opening and um enjoyable uh we've never spoken before and
you're you're a good bloke let me ask you a few closing questions and thank you for your time
uh this adelaide morning uh do you any personal advice to listeners um either those who are very
familiar with what you've said or those that you just dropped a bomb on their life uh with the last hour
and a half what what do you advise people who are becoming aware of of our reality i think i could
say to most people that indifference is probably the worst path to choose so you can avoid uncomfortable
conversations and topics uh but ultimately even though it's uncomfortable ultimately you can improve
your own well-being and that are your families if you put a little bit of emphasis on what these
biggest scale decisions mean for you and you know in most people that i don't care if you were brought
up in the inner city or you uh you know hard right winger or you know left lefty greenie you put someone
out in the bush somewhere and a nice day and they feel good you know and you just you don't even have
to see a lot of animals you know a butterfly might flip by it it's it's it's a good feeling we we
evolved in these kind of systems and we feel comfortable there just the fact that you have
some green space and get away from people um and you want to maintain some element of that into the
future and your children can benefit from that it's worth making a bit of noise about how we can change
these systems for the better so i think ultimately it sounds selfish but i think we the humans
we think in a selfish or at least a very nuclear way the people around us in our own lives and if
once we realize that we can make our lives better by consuming less and being um more involved with
the decision making that affects our societies then i think we have a chance of of of a future that's not
awful or ghastly as we like to say well you wrote you wrote some papers with the title ghastly and
then we'll we'll put them in the show notes um what about uh young people um how would you change
that advice for someone in their early 20s listen well i have a 17 year old daughter who is in fact
right at that age and being my daughter of course she's been aware of this since she was five years
old i remember making her cry when she was about six just telling her about climate change alone and
feeling feeling very bad about it afterwards but she know she's made many decisions already and you know 17
make a lot of decisions that don't necessarily manifest later on but most of her generation they
shun mass consumerism that i've seen anyway they do not want families um they don't want to drive
even even in australia they don't they don't want to drink or take drugs which is blows my mind
it's it's it's quite a different you would think that that would be an escape just on a cultural
demographic observation yeah it's a very interesting topic i'm not sure that i have any of the answers
but they seem to be in a little bit of a shell shock about the future and they're really focused on
being good people uh i think and and i think i do have a lot of hope with the younger generation
seeing that is that they're not gr you know chomping at the bit to make the most money or
to see the most places or have the biggest family just that ownership that consumerism i don't see
the same that when i grew up i could be the seed of a cultural change there i see it too yeah and
that's encouraging and i think while they're they're generally they're very sensitive you know at the
university the students coming in now that you have to walk on eggshells because the slightest thing will
put them off you know covert really knocked them for six as we say in australia that they're very
susceptible and their resilience is very low and you can understand why and they they've generally
very freaked out about the future um but they're also thinking about it not in in a form of desperation
they're actually changing how they live so do you are you teaching right now i am yes what what is
the name of the class you teach or more than one well i teach into quite a few but i do everything from
biodiversity conservation to restoration ecology to teaching statistics and mathematics and modeling
to talking about you know global um food systems and things like that so it touches on all elements
of environment so the topics that we discussed on this podcast you tell your students yeah i'm i'm
actually a little bit infamous for freaking out people in the second and third years so they say oh
when would wait till cory's classes because he'll he'll give you a so do do people choose to take
your class or do they have to uh well depending on which stream they're in yes they often have to take
it but uh it is it is quite interesting to see that most of them are quite up to speed with the fact that
things are bad they don't quite get the gravity or the magnitude of how bad it is and i think that's
what really kind of shocks them but almost always there's someone at the end of one of these classes
that says what are you doing to tell more people about this that's the question that comes out the
most and i'm thinking well i'm doing a lot but clearly i could do more you know if if it takes second
year university students to get this message i'm clearly not getting the message out as much as i should
it i agree with you um so let me ask you this and i know we're we're running a little over here
um it was my experience when i taught reality 101 for nine years at at the university of minnesota
that they signed up for it because it was kind of cool uh because we were talking about climate change
and energy and the environment and then during the class they were totally shell-shocked because i told
them things that they had never thought about like plastics and peak oil and and the money's
relationship to net energy but at the end of the semester they're like i learned more depressing things
about our reality than i had imagined but i actually feel better about it because i have a context
for understanding how things fit together and it sucks but i feel better for understanding it do your
students feel something similar do you think i get some feedback occasionally that that the kind
of information that we give them is often very useful for their immediate families and friends and
connections and that when people go oh you know don't worry about that stuff it's not a big deal
and they can well actually xyz and abc and this is happening this is something they they feel empowered
that they can actually start uh illicit change within their own peer groups and their own families
and i think that's that's where it has to start because we are social beings we operate in small
nuclear networks we don't have influence at the political level most of us and so if we can affect
some small change within even the perspective of our immediate neighbors and our families that that's an
empowering feeling and so i think that's what i hear from students often is that they can do that now
a few more questions what do you care most about in the world cory bradshaw other than velvet worms
what i care about most in the world i think just to look outside and see the beauty of of natural
systems that's that's makes me the happiest you know when i see when i see destruction when i see
you know i i it just it affects my soul i can't describe it any other way and so just maintaining
some sort of naturalist naturalness but when you look outside and see the beauty of the forest and
the ocean and the kookaburras and the platypus or whatever you see do you simultaneously see a future
echo of it uh and the emotions of of discounting that back um because of your research and awareness
of of the future of global ecosystems when i went to south africa for the first time and i went to the
kruger national park i took a photo of a white rhino running away in the in the dusk and it the way it
worked out is that it was kind of fuzzy and a little because it was low light it almost looked like the
the rhino was a ghost or becoming one and i use that as an analogy often in my talks about the ghost
rhino that's disappearing i got to see that rhino that day will i be able to see it in 20 30 years
maybe not and so but i i took great pleasure in the fact that i could see that animal and it might be
gone but i took pleasure in the moment and i can do stuff to hopefully you know maximize its resilience
and potential for persistence in the in the future but i saw it then and so i took pleasure in that
then i take a lot of photos um that's you know it's not very fulfilling from that perspective i like
seeing things in the flesh but at least i can look at the photos like you know that's a beautiful thing
i saw that i took that photo i was there i took some pleasure from that and that keeps me kind of going
you know if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse uh to you what is one thing
you would do to improve human and planetary futures if i could do one thing i would i would make all
political donations illegal that to me would be the biggest impact i could i could possibly make on the
planet if i could snap my fingers we had democracies actual democracies be more than i could ever
hope to achieve in my lifetime as a scientist well here here um so uh this has been great uh
i would like to have you back because i think we just scratched the surface um if you do come back
what is one topic that is relevant to human futures that we didn't discuss today that you are
a passionate about or a nerd about that you would be willing to take a deep dive on well i think i think
that um there's a lot of more deep diving to do just on the population um child health climate change
interactions and we're just starting to explore those in more detail and i think that we could get
into a lot of arguments about certainly uh net benefits and detriments in terms of population density
and the evidence underlying them so we could go in a lot more detail there i think um but if that's
if there's an appetite for that perhaps yeah it's part of our future and it's quite relevant so we'll
we'll try to do a population round table and i will invite you back well i would certainly if that if
that incurs definitely getting some better representation to both in terms of gender
uh origin race it's a absolutely i think that's a really good idea and you get different
perspectives but you also see that it's a bigger problem and it's yeah i you know i can't help the
way i look or who i am yeah yeah i it's it's i'm very cognizant of the fact that i'm i'm a middle-aged
white man from a rich rich country and regardless of the evidence you need to open that conversation
up to a broader group um i'll set it up cory okay that'd be brilliant and i can even potentially
suggest names to nate um if you're interested thank you so much i hope you enjoy your uh adelaide
weekend and thank you very much continued my friend thank you nate lovely to meet you and i appreciate
