i have to confess i'm relatively new to alice's work um but i was in contact with her probably
about uh six weeks ago now i think it was alice and uh we had a fascinating chat because for a
long time i've been kind of fascinated by the interrelationship between the cognitive line
and the social emotional line and what exactly is going on we seem to know very little about how
these two systems in the brain or in the body are interrelated and interconnected and uh this is
actually uh an area that alice has been thinking about and working working on for some while so uh
today really really pleased that alice can join us and tell us about her work and by the way
she also writes an extremely um insightful fascinating interesting blog uh on the mind of the coach
uh which i've been reading avidly in in recent weeks which i heartily recommend anybody who's in the
coaching business to have a look at so thank you alice i think uh without further ado i should hand
over to you ah thank you thank you so much for such a generous introduction i'm actually quite
nervous because uh there are so many people in this room whose wisdom i respect so deeply and from
whom i've learned so much so i really come uh with a learner mind as much as a sharing intention
because i think and and also this is such a beautiful audience for this type of content or for the
content that i'm passionate about because you're not here to learn about it you're here to co-create
and you you too are doing this work in the world so i am really really curious what you make of the
little threads that i'm gonna share and you know how you see it weaving into the bigger picture of this
work that we're all part of so very humbled and very grateful to be here my intention that i kind of
came with initially and i'm still holding it is to keep the intro part very very light because i'm
assuming already a foundation of knowledge and kind of invite you into the thick of what i found in my
own research in hopefully an experiential way rather than a theoretical way would that work for everyone
is that yeah awesome okay so just a big a bit of uh background and context i've come into adult
development research from a background as a practitioner a facilitator a coach in my home
country uh romania so i'm romanian and migrated to australia a few years ago uh we we have a really
interesting cultural context that i think has informed the work of those of us who have ended up in
this field because we didn't really have generations ahead of us to learn from so there was this before
1989 and after 1989 kind of two worlds which have completely and profoundly shaped my own upbringing
and my own history but also the context in which i've ended up doing this work and other people
like me have ended up doing this work so we have in my home country a whole generation of consultants
who are now in their 40s who started this work of consulting and facilitating in their early 20s
which i think in in western countries doesn't really happen because you would have a whole career
before you go into consulting whereas for us there was no corporate world to learn from so everybody
kind of jumped into this and those of us who were drawn to training and development kind of started
doing training and development as a thing so i've been immersed in it and grew up in it in a in a sense
as a practitioner um living it and also supporting others on this journey and i've had a lot of
frustrations over the years and the biggest frustration has been one that i'm pretty sure we share or
other people in this room share around the knowledge action gap you know what to do but you don't do it
and leaders know what to do and they don't do it and we were doing all of these soft skills programs
with all of these techniques for dialogue and you know good conversations and did delegation tools and
all of that stuff and people were just you know enjoying the learning and then not applying it so for me
this has been this obsessive question around what does it take to embody what you're learning what
does it take to actually have the maturity to be that person that you know theoretically would be
good or effective to be so this kind of uh i carried this through 15 years of practice till um
i felt like i i need to understand it more deeply and um i stepped into research to do a phd in it
and as part of that i moved to australia and took life over or started like life over which in itself
if we think disorienting dilemmas and heat experiences uh has been a really good case study
of what a massive disorienting dilemma can look like uh in terms of dissolution of identity kind
of no more um feedback around you know who you are and what the value that you bring is so i in a way
i lived my research as i was conducting my research and i was really lucky to uh be given access to
one of the largest leadership development programs here in australia new zealand 250 leaders cross
sector cross industry every year we're going through this program uh and the program itself was
developmental without being um explicitly presented as developmental but uh keegan was part of the faculty
and amy edmondson was part of the faculty and ron heifetz was part of the faculty so
this was this just amazing opportunity for me to see the impact of this collective holding space
these amazing people were creating and it so happened i ran the study in 2020 when all of a
sudden the program went online everybody went in lockdown everybody was deeply traumatized and
going through this program at the same time um and i had this this question in my mind how do you
actually capture learning as it is happening because in previous least research around the
impact development impact of programs like this people would look at the end and kind of ask
participants you know what was the experience but six months later it's not the same as as you are in it
so i invited these people to journal through the program every week they would be journaling around
actual stuff that was happening in their lives not necessarily in the program itself so people shared
losing loved ones they shared the anxiety of not knowing how to reorganize their businesses
uh they shared a lot of personal stuff in the journals and journal entries and they also gave me
access to their teams to inquire you know are you noticing any changes in the behavior of your leader
and they also sat through interviews with me so i ended up with this massive massive mountain of
data and also measured them before and after with the with the glp to kind of see you know is there in
within six months any shift in their development the bottom line was that 30 did shift or the glp
said they did shift into a later stage uh now after watching aiden's research and i highly encourage you to
check out aiden thornton's um dissertation it's uh i'm currently having my mind blown and kind of
trying to integrate what that means for us um but um 30 developed and 70 didn't and interestingly 30
not only did not grow but they regressed into an earlier stage after the program and even more
interestingly the people who regressed were the latest stage people so that was very very intriguing to me
may not be surprising to some of you um so this is the short ish story of what i set out to uh find
and the invitation that i've got for you is to experience what i found rather than me telling
you what i discovered let me just very briefly share this uh this fundamental difference between
horizontal development and vertical development and i know that vertical development in itself
is a bit of a controversial term and there are many arguments for which maybe we shouldn't be using
it because it's a blanket statement for a host of complexity of development but i think in the
service of bringing this work to the general public perhaps horizontal and vertical are the best terms
that i think we have at the moment but essentially my understanding of it and the way i've treated it in
my research is that horizontal defines what we know the content of what we know and as i was kind of um
going through the literature i started to have an issue with this idea of hierarchy that is implied
by horizontal and vertical so i came up with a metaphor to accompany this which is this metaphor
of the piano so when you learn to play the piano you need to learn the technique you need to learn
musical theory you need to learn all of the technical aspects of piano playing so you can be a decent
piano player and that is your horizontal development but then your vertical development in the metaphor
of the piano is how many octaves on your piano are you actually playing how complex is the music that
you're able to create and what is your relationship to the music itself so vertical would look at how we
think the mindsets we bring to the work we do the structure of our minds rather than the content of
our minds so when i say that some of the participants in my research developed something in the structure
of their thinking seems to have shifted towards more complexity towards more maturity and for some
of them they seem to have lost access to the complexity and maturity they could access six months previously
so that to me was really really intriguing as to you know what is it that actually happened and why
and i could only find one thing that was a clear differentiator between these two categories of
people and the experience i'm about to invite you into is what they came across or stumbled into
instinctively i then turned it into a practice that i might now integrating into my work
so how much sense does this make and any thoughts and any yeah just
anything from anyone before i go forward
and maybe at the end we can actually uh talk a little bit more if people are interested about
you know the metaphors we actually use in our work and and how these metaphors can bring it to
life in different ways or elicit different reactions in the people we're supporting in their
own development just to mention um it's a dialectical thinking group here and um i find myself always
wondering about the distinctions that we make between vertical and horizontal and how we might
integrate that distinction as well as the distinction between theory and practice or a theory and
experience um so i i think we must realize that these these are just metaphors and therefore they are
simplifications and the complexity is somehow uh bound up in the integration of the two yes i i wholeheartedly
agree with that statement nick yeah
no so i actually started to dive a bit more deeply into otto's work and uh i'm i think i'm
just starting to scratch the surface now uh through ursula who opened this amazing universe to me so i was
aware of otto's work but i didn't go deep in it i hear you and i absolutely resonate with that um and
that definitely isn't the angle that i've taken it and it's it is an interesting then question perhaps
maybe uh for afterwards when we're kind of sense making but i'm wondering you know how do we keep
the the integrity and the ethics of our practice while still staying open to learn and cross-pollinate
because um and i say this because when i came into it i had no allegiance to any school of thought
and i just like any you know beginner researcher i started to kind of do my lit review and
see you know who are the people who have measured adult development and how they have done it and
uh i ended up using the glp because just practically torbert's work was the most robust from a validation
perspective so there was enough data published apart from lovinger's initial work like you know as
a modern tool the glp was the one that had most written things about it that i could find so i ended
up kind of using his framework as my main measurement framework for that very reason but in the processes
i've gotten to actually know some of the people in the space and you know uh get to know them as
humans as well as researchers i've come i've become very intrigued about could we cross pollinate more
but i'm also hearing you say is there too much like is there a moment when you're actually connecting
this with stuff that has nothing to do with it and where is that boundary
i don't know where where it is exactly but i'm intrigued by that question
i hear you yeah but um in terms of my theoretical framework just to clarify what that was
the adult development a part of it was informed by kudgrider and torbert's and keegan's work as the
three big thinkers uh and i also brought in transformative learning and mesero's work because
as a practitioner for me it's always intriguing you know how do we design learning development
experiences that are actually developmental so i felt that that cross-pollination between adult
development and transformative learning is an interesting intersection uh so that is the the
academic the theoretical lens if you want that i took to this the experience i was um suggesting we
might uh you know play with to see what i found so the the one thing that came out of it was that
everybody during that year experienced profound disorienting uh dilemmas of all kinds and all
types of dilemmas from personal ones to professional ones so nobody was spared but how people dealt with
these dilemmas was very very different so i would love as a practice if you'd be keen to play and you
don't have to share with anyone what you're working on but if there is a dilemma that you're struggling
with personally at the moment or professionally you as a human on your own journey i'd love to invite
you to tap into a dilemma for a little bit and walk you through some steps that my research participants
seem to have figured out instinctively intuitively that have turned out to be developmental for them
just so you have a bit of a felt experience of it so then we can kind of unpack it together that
will involve a bit of thinking but it it will involve quite a bit of feeling as well so to preface
that and i'm pretty sure this group here is uh comfortable with getting into the deep spaces
but i always say you know if it feels uncomfortable at any point you just don't want to do it anymore
just stop but i am going to invite you into the body to feel some of your feelings at some point in this
exercise you happy to do that have a go at it okay so you'll need some pen and paper
and we'll do an alternation of sort of guided meditation type of um invitation with some
journaling of things that you find in in a few steps that we'll take together so does everybody
have a dilemma that they would be keen to work on for themselves in the next 20 minutes or so
and a dilemma has to feel like a tension between two opposing needs could be a decision
could be something that really makes you feel torn in some way and it feels unresolved and it feels
a bit stuck and you should be able to to write it down or define it as on the one hand something and on the
other hand something else it's a bit of a polarity we could think of it like that as well
and it but it has to feel or or it's ideal if you choose one that really feels emotionally charged for
you you're you're really working your way through it and haven't found your way through it but you
know what the two sides of it are so i invite you to just write down those two sides of your dilemma
i'll just bring them to mind if writing down is not an option okay everybody's got their dilemma
down on paper yeah awesome so i'd love you to uh close your eyes for a few moments
and just bring this dilemma to your awareness to mind and just notice what are the thoughts that come
up it's almost like you're taking on a role of journalists documenting your own thinking about
this dilemma not feelings yet but just thoughts what is the landscape of thoughts when you bring these
two sides of the dilemma to mind what thoughts emerge there might be trains of thoughts thoughts
throwing you into another thought and another thought you might want to follow those strains of thought
for a bit but i invite you not to start analyzing why you're having the thoughts just acknowledge the
thoughts themselves it's giving you a few seconds to be in that space of
thought around this island just maybe notice how busy is your mind right now how many thoughts are there
are there some thoughts that are just stronger they just come up recurrently they seem to take over the
landscape and trying to capture as many of them as you possibly can acknowledging them
not judging or analyzing just noting them
when you feel you've got a grasp
you might want to write down record just as a journalist would record the thoughts that have
come to your consciousness right now around this dilemma
download them in a way from your mind onto paper
try writing down as many as you can
let me know when you feel like your mind is a bit emptier and much of the important thoughts are
or many of them are already down on paper okay ready to go to the next step yep so i'd love you to close
your eyes again if you feel comfortable to do that and now with your thoughts out of your mind they're
they're there they're recorded still holding the dilemma in awareness
i invite you to shift your attention to your body
and just notice every sensation you possibly can that is present in your body and you know is connected to this dilemma
and i'm saying sensation and not emotion for now because i'd love you to just observe
anything that you can pick up things that you might not even have a name for
what are you noticing from the tip of your toes to the top of your head what is present in your body
and just acknowledging these sensations
and acknowledging what happens when you acknowledge them
so if you find a sensation in the body that you maybe haven't been aware of before
that is present because you're holding this dilemma in awareness
what's your impulse what do you feel like doing do you feel like leaning into it or studying it or do you
feel like not wanting to feel it anymore leaning away from it just acknowledge the impulses that arise when you
identify any of these sensations
and if you love to learn in a visual way or a kinesthetic way you might even notice colors or
textures or certain consistencies associated with some of these sensations just notice what is there
there and if you allow your attention to expand and really hold all of these sensations are there emotions
present in the body that you can name
and if yes what are they what are the emotions that this dilemma brings up in you
you might want to even be precise and find the emotion and the sensation and how they might be connected and just observe that
and as you notice all of this and you notice your impulses towards all of these emotions and all of these sensations
i'd love you to bring in intentionally purposefully curiosity you might even imagine you're pouring in into yourself
like a substance curiosity that comes and infuses
your body and touches every one of these sensations you've just picked up
you might have one particular emotion or sensation that you really want to be curious about you're intrigued by it
and you just allow yourself to be purely curious you have no idea what you're gonna find
you're not even trying to think about it you're just experiencing the sensation of curiosity bearing
on the emotion you picked up on earlier
and just breathing into this mix all of the sensations all of the emotions connected to your dilemma
and curiosity together what does that feel like in your body
and what are you noticing happen if anything
is anything changing at all do those sensations shift in any way
as you brought in curiosity just acknowledging that for a moment and as you do you might feel moved to
write down some of the things you found out you discovered you noticed you felt
or you might grow you might sketch something
there might be a particular movement of the body that you feel moved to create
a particular movement of the body that you feel moved to create a particular movement of the body
i'm particularly inviting you to notice and record any shifts that might have happened
when you brought curiosity in or anything you you noticed before and after curiosity anything that
you found interesting or intriguing in some way
when when you feel like you you're complete with this step
so one last invitation for all of you is to just allow yourself now to go back to the dilemma and the original thoughts you had
and just bringing all of this wisdom you've tapped into all of this learning from going into your body
and bringing curiosity in and just noticing what thoughts are present now about the dilemma
noticing if anything has changed in your thinking or if any new thoughts have arisen in some way
and even if there is any experiment
a moment or some sort of action impulse that arises from this reflection something that maybe becomes
possible or a door that opens in some way
that you might be keen to explore afterwards
and as before if you want to talk down anything that you're finding interesting in the shifting
landscape of your thinking just to be able to return to it and maybe reflect a bit later on
you're welcome to take a moment and and jot down
is everybody feeling like they're complete yeah okay whoever might want to share a little bit of their
observations and experience
you're um you're bringing up something really interesting
I love that you're bringing up something really interesting, and I'll show you what actually
came out of my data, that you said the fear didn't go away, it just moved into the background,
so it's still there, but it's almost like the perspective on it has shifted, and you're also,
but if I got correctly what you were saying, you can hold it without being paralyzed by it,
with this new perspective, so it's still there, but you can work with it, there's something,
something becomes possible despite the fear, it's not like we've solved for the fear,
but we've made it manageable in a way, or you've made it manageable, kind of playing with it in this
way, and bringing curiosity in, yeah, thank you, does anyone want to build on that, or does anyone
hold a question that they'd like to bring in, I'll be happy to show you the science behind what we did,
and hear your thoughts afterwards, thank you, I love the words you bring to it, yeah, awesome,
so would you like me to share with you the framework behind this, so then we can kind of open up the
conversation and see what we make of it, would that be okay to do, yeah, so,
so what I found as the only differentiator between the people who developed and the people who didn't
develop was how they dealt with the emotional landscape that was brought up by their disorienting
dilemmas, so when we face these dilemmas, these big conundrums where things just do not make sense
anymore, all of us seem to drop into this space that Kaisu Malki, some of you might be familiar
with her work, she's in the space of transformative learning, she's a researcher from Finland, whose
work I absolutely love, and she coined this term of edge emotions, which are all of the emotions we
feel at the edge of our meaning making, it's that very moment where you're current, it's almost in
in Bob Keegan's, for those of you who are familiar with his subject object theory, and I know there
are many of you who are, it's that moment when you're just, you feel the limits of that thing
which you're subject to, it just doesn't make sense to you anymore, but you can't make it object, you
can't look at your mindset yet, and there's that desperation, that locked kind of brain moment,
and we feel these edge emotions, so what I found was that most of us don't want to feel them,
and that's not no surprise to anybody probably, and people not only don't want to feel them, but
particularly in these highly competitive performance-driven corporate contexts, people
feel like something is very deeply wrong with them when they feel this stuff, so high-performing leaders
don't want to feel fear and anxiety and confusion, that is very threatening, and there's a lot of shame
that comes with that, which is another edge emotion, so most people in my study, when they felt this,
they started to either shut down, distract themselves, blame the environment, so they would
say things like, you know, we went through immunity to change, and yes, it was an interesting intellectual
exercise, but you know, I'm so busy, and I didn't have time to apply anything, and other people talked
about going through the immunity to change exercise, which Bob Keegan facilitated for that group, and
saying it was terrifying, what I found just freaked me out, and I was so amazed that I was so freaked
out, so that minority of people who shifted, they believe they have choice, so they chose to engage
with these emotions instead of shun them or ignore them, they owned them as something that is theirs, and
there's value in it, and almost all of them brought in curiosity, which was super intriguing for me as a
finding, so all of them spoke about, I was very intrigued as to why I was so anxious, why I was so
fearful, why I was so, you know, as you so beautifully just mentioned before, wow, why is this so much fear
around something that I've done over and over again, and I've been through this before, it just is so
intriguing to me, and when they did that, something really, really interesting seemed to happen, which
I've ended up naming or calling the contrasting emotion space, where the original edge emotion doesn't go
away, but it becomes bearable under the impact of curiosity, so that it's almost like a chemical
reaction, or that's how I picture it, where curiosity tempers in a way those edge emotions, and for those of you
who are into the neuroscience of this, I think it would be fascinating to actually look at the, you know,
sympathetic activation and parasympathetic activation, and how these emotions, when they come
together, create a space of enough emotional balance, so people can actually critically reflect, so in a
way, if we accept that adult development, and I think in dialectical thinking, for me, it's all
about critical reflection at the end of the day, but we don't really critically reflect, I think, or I
found, unless we're able to work our way through these super challenging and painful emotions that come
with having our minds changed, with allowing our minds to be changed, so when people engaged and went
into this space of contrasting emotions, and were curious enough, so the discomfort became bearable,
they started to challenge their own assumptions, to kind of question their old patterns of thought,
you were speaking about conditioning, Alan, even being able to notice your own conditioning, and kind of
make it object, that's also powerful critical reflection, right, and from that came new meaning, new
insight, and came new ways of doing things, and very interestingly, again, and not surprisingly, kind of all
fell into place, once I kind of step back to it, from it, and see the whole picture, people who went through
this process successfully, they were way more likely to experiment, and act on their insights, which for us as
learning designers, as facilitators, as coaches, that's our obsession, right, how do we help people to actually do the
thing that they realize needs done, to close that action inside gap, so, and kind of my insight after
the research was that perhaps the reason these people experimented more was that in the course of
experimenting, they encounter edge emotions again, but now they have a way to deal with them, so you're
going to go out, and you're going to try a new behavior, and you go, it's going to feel really, you know, scary, so to
give you an example, I had one of the research participants, he was a board member in the
organization he was part of, and one of his disorienting dilemmas, when he did his immunity
to change, was around a really hard topic that he had been procrastinating for months in bringing
into the board as a topic, because it would have opened a can of worms, and it would have made him
the, you know, the conflict generator, and he was the peacemaker, that was his identity, so he just could
not conceive opening that can of worms, but he knew it had to be done, so he talked about how terrifying
that was for him to actually go out and do this, have that actual conversation, so he designed this
experiment for himself to actually bring that topic up in the next board meeting, and when I interviewed
him, he described this whole process from his perspective as bringing in that conversation,
how afraid he was, how fearful of the judgment of the others in the room, and how conscious of, you know,
how limiting his thinking had been up to that point, and interestingly enough, people did not react,
not even remotely as badly as he had anticipated, so that kind of reinforced his belief that, oh,
actually to have courage and open up something that can be conflictual can also be healing,
so I can still hold some of that identity that I have as a healer, which was part of the peacemaker
kind of label that he had carried along with himself for a very long time, but I can still be
a healer, even when I'm in conflict, or when I bring up stuff that makes other people uncomfortable,
so there was a shift in awareness, and there was a shift in action, and there was a shift in self-concept,
but at the core of it was this struggle with being curious about why emotionally it's so hard,
and finally, the last element that came out was that the way to support this process for people
is through inquiry, but inquiry including that emotional landscape, which I think for a lot of
coaches who have a preference for the cognitive approach, that is an interesting stretch to really
sit with our clients in the emotional space, and in the somatic space alongside the cognitive,
in facilitation the same, I've experimented with this with, you know, very interesting types of
audiences like policing, where people have done the exercise you've just done now, and it led to
some really fascinating conversations afterwards, so that kind of inquiry with of action prompting,
and also that capacity to hold space for the group to feel safe enough to tap into this discomfort,
so I would say that the external circle is an invitation, a prompt for what can we do to hold this
process for people, and I'm sure there would be other elements for it, but these are the ones that
I'm, I have data on, and I can kind of say, you know, I think, I think they have value, or I'm confident
to advocate for their value, so that's kind of the story of, of the frame behind, what do you think,
questions you have, what reflections do you have, I'll be happy to share these slides if anybody needs
them, I'm actually wondering, I mean, what this prompts for me is whether the context in which
we use our cognition and emotions are very different, but I think human nature at the core
it's still human nature in these very, very different contexts, so I'm almost intrigued by this
idea of how does actually cognition and emotion, how do they meet, and how do they end up,
I don't know what the word is, enhancing each other for the benefit of the human growth in that
context, so I don't know, how do we support leaders to have the emotional capacity to withstand the pain
of cognitive dissonance when somebody proves them wrong, because, you know, I think cognitive dissonance
when you see counter evidence to your beliefs is actually emotional pain, it's edgy emotions, so if we
were able to have this capacity to withstand that discomfort, maybe we would allow ourselves to be grown
by others and grow others in turn more readily, and even in the scientific community, I've witnessed
recently some very interesting debates, and you can see this playing out, the resistance we have, when
somebody brings in something that contradicts our worldview, or our expertise, or the stuff that we've
defined ourselves through, that to me is again an example of being thrown in midst of edge emotions,
and, you know, where are we able to sit with curiosity and go, oh, this feels pretty uncomfortable,
this person 20 years younger than me kind of challenging something that I've been working on
all my life, how do I stay open to that, and I think there are myriad other examples, I'm involved now in an
interesting cross-national policing senior leadership development program with police leaders from 10
countries, and this is at the core of the conversations that they're having around, you know, to have
transnational collaboration, you actually have to also have an attention to self, and emotions in that
environment are really anathema, but they're now discussing emotional emotions and emotional maturity
and vertical development as a thing, so yeah, I'm just intrigued by how many places this thing can find
application in, or this way of, yeah, thinking or inquiring.
Yeah, I'd love, I mean, there might be people who have a perspective on that question, or more
perspectives on that question, but my prevalent thought on that is, have you ever seen a child
who's not inherently curious, because I have never seen one, I really think that curiosity is part of
our fundamental human going towards seeking impulse, so I wonder if, you know, what we perceive as a lack
of curiosity is actually the result of trauma and kind of not wanting to lean into these spaces,
and I'm sure all of you working with leaders have heard that, you know, I know I need to think about
this stuff, but it's just terrifying to go there, because I might, I don't know what I'll find,
and if I tap into what I feel, that'll be, you know, potentially terrifying, or potentially,
what if I can't bring myself back from that, so I wonder if it's lack of curiosity, or it's actually
an overwhelm of, you know, it's just too much of, yes, I love this, yes, Theo Dawson, and this makes me
also think of Maria Montessori and her horme, the Greek word that she used to define that life force
present in every child, where if you create the context, they just go for it, they're always seeking
to learn, it's so fundamental, yeah.
I love how your mind goes to application, because that is what I'm really intrigued by, you know,
if there is a bit of a nugget of value in this, in the idea of bringing curiosity to bear on our
difficult emotions, so we make space, you know, what are creative ways to integrate this with
different practices that different people are doing, or learn from each other, you know, how do
you do it, how might I do it, I think there's so much value in that.
So, I think it's super important, what you're saying, because what I noticed is nobody in my
research spoke about feeling positively from being curious about their negative emotions,
so that was not the outcome, it was more the fear receding a little bit into the background
and making room for possibility, so I make it a point in my practice to actually normalize the
discomfort, not positivize it, almost, and I'll give you an example that has been so striking and
personal to me, when I was writing my dissertation, my daughter was six, and she was playing the piano
downstairs, and I was writing up here in my office, and I heard her stop, like make a mistake, make a
second mistake, and then stop and throw the book and start crying, and shouting, I'm never playing
piano again, and I was wondering, how do you, how do I explain this stuff to a six-year-old in a way that
makes sense to them, and is helpful, and you know how kids at that age, they have pains in their
joints frequently, so we often spoke about the pains in her joints, because she's growing up, and it's
just unpleasant, but it's part of growing up, so it occurred to me to make this analogy, and I said to
her, so how are you feeling, I'm angry, and this is stupid, and I can't get it, and I said, look, do you
know those pains in your joints, yes, do you like them, no, do you accept them, yes, because this means
that I grow up, okay, what if this is pain in your mind, and your heart, this frustration, this anger
you're fearing, you're feeling, is the growth pain in your mind, and it's not, it's not going to go
away, it's just a sign that your mind is growing, honestly, it's been, and she's eight now, three years
later, it's been just game-changing, it's, and she's not any way, in any shape or form, more willing to be
frustrated, to be clear, she still doesn't enjoy it, I don't enjoy it, but there's an acceptance of it, so I
feel, I don't know if this, if this touches or answers your question, but I, that is my way of
not positivizing it, but normalizing it, and for me, these are very different things, it's almost, you
know, how do we recognize the growth pains in our hearts from healing from a painful past, from
healing from recent pain, and outgrowing that pain, without trying, and I also think, in a way, if you
think of toxic positivity, and how positive psychology has been misused in many ways, to, to
kind of put forward this lens of everything has to be smiles, and joy, and it's not, that to me, is
also avoiding edge emotions, and I don't think we're doing the work when we're positivizing, we're
actually avoiding doing the work, yeah, you know, I'm inviting you to experiment with this, really,
because I think it's also new, and I'm, I'm just learning, I am, and I'm experimenting myself, so
the more of us play with this, and maybe we share what we're learning, the more we can actually learn,
um, but I noticed that the, the power of this thing seems to be when you bring curiosity, not to your
thoughts, or your cognition, but to your body, almost like, bring curiosity in as a sensation,
you might have no idea what is actually occurring, but something is occurring, so it's almost like a
somatic invitation to access curiosity, to soothe your soma, so you can hold more in your mind,
so in a way, when you, when you say error, to me, that, that makes me think of cognition, am I right,
or am I wrong, but I think if I bring this just into the body first, it doesn't even matter if
I'm right or wrong, this is what I'm feeling, and I'm just being curious about what I'm feeling in
this moment, and through the simple act, or choice of being curious, something really powerful happens
where I relax enough, I can withstand that discomfort enough for my mind to go to new places,
perhaps in dialogue with other minds, so it doesn't have to be a solo exercise, but I think
it's, to Ansi's point, when you do it together, it, it is probably 10 times more powerful when you
do it with other people, but it's, um, so often people go, oh, and I, when I ask myself a question
about those thoughts, 20 other thoughts come, but it's not about asking a question, it's about
trying to access the emotion of curiosity in your own gut, in your body, in wherever you feel,
in your feelings, in your throat, does that distinction make sense?
It is, it, 100%, I think that's the word.
I, I love that distinction, I think it's so important, and I also wonder, Jonathan, in the
context of practice, how confusing can it get when we, like, even, it's, it's, it's reminding
me, are we defining the terms that we're using, because I think the majority of people in the
context that I work in, and I'm sure those you work in, in, in, like, professional spaces,
when you say cognitive, people think just rational, analytical, abstract, and it's, it's, when we talk
about the thing, or we think about the thing, but we don't want to feel the thing, that's
kind of my, um, informal way of trying to make sense of, I think, what you just said, when
in fact, they're never unrelated, and in a way, you could also say people might sit in
the, in the hyper-rational realm, as a way to avoid feeling the pain of whatever it is
that they're not wanting to feel, um, yeah, it's interesting, and also, I'm intrigued by
your comment there, that, you know, seeking curiosity kills curiosity, and I was wondering
if you might want to just maybe share a bit more about your thinking, when you, when you
say that, and...
So are you, is that, in a way, kind of inviting us to think, if you are to introduce this,
or invite people into this kind of activity, how do you make sure, um, I don't even know
what the answer is, but I'm almost, I'm thinking, when I hear you talk, I think the people in
my study, what it seemed to me was that they had this belief that those emotions held some
value, so in the, you know, love for truth kind of principle, they did believe there was
value in those emotions, and that prompted their curiosity, it was like, ah, my body is
selling me this thing, there must be truth in it, there must be value in it, even if I
don't like what I'm feeling, so what is it, so then curiosity, in a sense, emerged as a
result of that assumption, of that underlying assumption, versus, I'm feeling anxiety, something's
wrong with me, I've got to fix it, so I think the, the belief system, or the assumptions
were very different in the two cases, and then now as a practitioner, I'm wondering, how
do you teach this thing without forcing it, or how do you teach this thing in a way where
people access something that is already in them, um, to kind of, yeah, connect it back
to what you say, how do we not seek in a way that kills it, but harness it in service of
growth?
It's never my opening activity when I work with a group, to put it that way, but I have
noticed that once you have trust with a group, this kind of work becomes, people are hungry
for this kind of work, when, when the space is safe and interesting, and, and their brains
are stimulated, I think that's where that intellectual aspect can work in our favor, where, where
there's substance to it in a way where, you know, I, there's an explanation, but let's have
an experience, so then it's almost like the rational mind goes, okay, um, I'm not completely
out of my depth here, I'm going to just step into something a bit, a bit different, um, but
yeah, if, if people experiment with versions of this, or, you know, see links with your
own work and might want to share, I would love to learn from your wisdom.
Yeah.
Um, it's been a fantastic session, and if I can end on a slightly dialectical note, I think
following Ursula's prompt, um, I, I kind of see, um, that the thinking system is sometimes
in conflict with the feeling system in people, and this conflict is, is preventing development,
but what you pointed to today is the idea of curiosity, which perhaps belongs to both systems,
both thinking and feeling, acts as some kind of bridge, uh, reconciling the conflict between
those two systems, and therefore enabling development.
Um, so that's, uh, that's a great dialectical note to end on, and, uh, I hope people will,
will continue the dialogue with you, um, because, uh, sharing knowledge in this way is so, so
valuable, and now we have these, uh, zoom technologies that's so easy to do.
Um, so, uh, so once again, thank you very much, and thank you everyone for participating today.
Thank you so much.
It's been wonderful, uh, being here and learning with all of you.
Looking forward to the follow-up conversations.
Thank you.
