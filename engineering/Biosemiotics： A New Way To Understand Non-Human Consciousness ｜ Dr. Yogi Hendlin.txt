does nature speak to us in a language that we don't fully hear anymore yes this video is about
biosemiotics a new way to understand non-human consciousness in nature what you saw was the
elephants on the coastal zones they broke free from their shackles and they headed for the hills
and the people followed them before the tsunami this is of course yeah hours before the tsunami
no human and none of our artifacts of measurement knew what was going on but they knew
our mind is in the world our mind is emergent through the relations we have with all the other
beings and all the other strands every organism sees a different part of reality yeah as a different
dashboard yeah and insofar as we can become aware of any other organism we are sharing some sort of
there's some overlap you're killing ways of seeing the world ways of being in the world
you know when we destroy olive trees that have been around for a thousand years we don't know
what relations those olive trees were holding up on an ecological level but also on a semiotic one
when we are scrolling through our black mirrors you know looking for that dopamine release what we're
actually craving is to be nestled in the branches or the roots of a tree in japan they have shinrin yoku
forest bathing where doctors prescribe for various illnesses go be in a forest lie down breathe be there
for an hour feel all your emotions we need to feel again you said that's the only way that we will survive
very warm welcome at the ascentia foundation's youtube channel i'm sitting down here with dr
yogi henlin yogi a very warm welcome thank you so much great that you are here and what i found so
nice is that you live so nearby because i found out that you live in zutphen and zutphen which is
only like 20 kilometers so that's awesome yeah i took the train took me like 10 minutes perfect it's
great that you are here um you are an environmental philosopher assistant professor at the rasmus school
of philosophy in rotterdam in the netherlands and you've worked as a public health scientist at the
university of california for 20 years and very important you are editor-in-chief of the journal
of biosemiotics now what biosemiotic is we will touch upon later in this conversation and but i have
an opening question that definitely relates to it um we previously had a video with federico fargin the
physicist and inventor of the first cpu um who basically states that space-time the world we see around us
is the universe talking to itself it's a symbolic representation of consciousness in his theory
thinking about biosemiotics so the meaning making of nature in nature which you study made me think
and see a similarity with the thinking of federico and which leads me to the opening question does
nature speak to us in a language and in a language that we i think in the west and definitely last 200
years don't fully hear anymore cannot understand anymore well um sorry for the long short answer is
yes the inhalation of 50 000 microbes and the exhalation of 50 000 microbes every time this is every
time you breathe yeah it's just uh it's amazing yeah it's a uh gas exchange of you know countless
microorganisms now are those microorganisms affecting our thought our feeling our physiology i would say yes
they are impacting our interface or dashboard of perception now are they doing this in a way that
directly is um sort of a homunculus style in our brain in our pineal gland typing away at a keyboard
saying okay now we're programming him to say this absolutely not but there is an influence however
subtle and however um however nuanced that i think most of us are including myself on a day-to-day basis
unaware of so when we talk about nature there's typically a breakdown between the biotic the abiotic
and the artificial right sort of three different realms um and one way to look at this question of
is nature communicating with us uh constantly is the question that you get in biophysics right by
biophotons like with light for example there is some sort of communication in photons hitting our eyes
photons hitting our skin in a similar way but different from how red light and blue light affects us
when we're staring at a computer screen late at night i have a red shift on my computer so that it
doesn't keep me up plants respond in the exact same way to red and blue light blue light wakes them up
red light puts them to sleep and so when we understand through a synesthetic lens communication
then we don't need to privilege one or another sorry what's that synesthetic synesthesia right so so
synesthesia is like hearing a taste or um feeling kinesthetically a sound right and i'm not just
talking about bass waves in front of big speakers at a rave or anything i'm talking about how the
senses in many people and in many uh altered states of consciousness or peak experiences um the the wiring
of our different senses our sense of smell taste uh sight uh hearing and feel touch um in fact um
they interleaf with each other so there are other ways in which we can understand reality than through
a strict one-to-one sense channel relationship and it's this harmonization of various sense data
through various channels which impinge upon and supervene upon different um ways in which we are
impacted as embodied conscious beings enables us to select wider what i hear you say but correct me if
i'm wrong is that with our rational way of thinking we we narrow down the world with our con our abstractions
our models of the world right and are you saying that selecting wider would be open to much more data
also data that we sometimes cannot sort of conceive conceptually or scientifically yet but that does
influence us for instance you were correctly you're mentioning microbes we didn't on our channel i made
a documentary about sort of bacteria and was stunned about the gut gut microbiome access and and even
certain guts uh microbiomes might really influence people to eat more fat fat food because you have
microbes that want that and somehow have found a way to tell your brains that to eat that fat food so
you're directly they're like active agents influencing us are you saying with selecting wider we we should be
open to all of that and also i'm curious about that that question of agency because when you say
if nature gives us science who is who is sending those signs is our agency sort of in in in microbes in
plants in nature around us so you're touching upon an ecological question when when i mentioned selecting
wider i'm definitely talking about the decentralization of agency so for the last 500 years or so with the
enlightenment there was a certain strand of thought that became dominant which led to this notion
notion that only humans and if we're to be honest uh historically only a very small fraction of humans
um had reason right and this reason was very constrained so it wasn't about uh praxis or practical reason
it was about a abstract sort of uh i guess what aristotle called news
um and that was seen as the only form of rationality that mattered i am along the lines of robert sapolsky
in his work in you know best known in uh behave and determined where he talks about
we as humans most of the time you know kant talks about autonomy and then on the other side of the
spectrum we have automaticity and descartes and bacon we're saying these animals these non-humans
and most humans they're just purely automatic and what neuroscience and cognitive science especially
you know 5ea um extended uh embodied inactive uh ecological and embedded and affective
cognitive science shows is that our mind is in the world our mind is emergent through the relations we
have with all the other beings and all the other strands both from the skin in and the skin out and
one of the really important things here um that i sort of just want to get off my chest to begin with
is the compartmentalization of thinking okay so if agency is de-centered then what makes us think
that our unitary consciousness is ours or us right and would it be different if i didn't have a liver
or if you weren't here or if the light were a different color um would i still be me in the same
way and if the answer in any such way is no then there is a relational ontology right there's a
relational sense of self but on the other hand we know that there is continuity right yeah so you know
if i get my arm chopped off i'm still me in many respects now i will also change in some respects but it
would stress me in a way which would directly change me here in a sense yeah and what what i hear you
say is it makes me think of sort of going back sort of we started with microbes and studying the world
and empiricism of you're mentioning the empiricism of francis bacon and he said stuff like that yeah
like well i think we should burn everything that has to do with like if it's not if you cannot prove
it you know that that hardcore empiricism and what i found interesting uh i found out when making a
documentary about bacteria that sort of at the same time that that they cut was in an ellens by the way
writing oh yeah absolutely in amsterdam candles he was writing that and at the same time we had
anthony van leeuw studying bacteria for the first time through a microscope his microscope and the
the both go very well they go hand in hand because it was very functional to see those little blobs
of order moving in front of his lens to just see them as them or they or the other and just studying
and think that you can study it objectively that doesn't affect us so that that cut that made science
possible in a sense so if i'd ask you sort of the ontology the metaphysics of scientism right that
we see right now that sort of that you think that you can sort of have this glass between you and the
world which functioned very well um do you think that that is at the root of the problems we see right
now when you mention stuff for instance in your like a meta crisis of a pre-crisis you call it yeah
yeah absolutely i think the the meta crisis which is a crisis of mental health uh physical health
chronic disease societal disease and planetary disease all brought upon by um you could say
unfounded assumptions of uh yeah you could call it reductionism you could call it a narrow vision of
rationality because i very much um think that rationality is extremely important for solving this
but what we're taking to be valid scientific measurement is actually this recursive process
that is not based on anything so it's you could say in attempting to lay foundations for a theory of
scientific knowledge it in fact is um you know a castle made of sand um and that's a pretty bold
thing to say are you sort of like the the whole what what part of science do you think does this sort
of um well you know i i would go back to um the early uh 20th century where you have heisenberg and
bores and these scientists realizing the influence and impact of the um observer niels Bohr uh has this
notion not of uh deflection not of you know receiving something but of diffraction right so that every um
you know it goes back to goethe's uh color theory so what is light what is color to us it's neither
in the uh object itself nor in our eye it's in the relation the sefir wharf hypothesis about color in
ancient greek um perception says that it's not just a physiological change it's also a cultural cognitive
change so that if you don't have the concept of the color blue then the sea is wine red the sky is gray
we are very much constrained by our cultural concepts for how we understand how the world works yeah
this notion that we live in a communicative order completely underpins biology biologists cannot get
away from metaphors like signaling communication transcription all these things which are process
based based based they're relation based they're based on awareness in even molecules of other
things uh so there is this sense of at the most fundamental level in awareness of one's relations now
in biosomatics we generally go down to the cell level as the sort of minimum model of communication
um uh my colleague jeremy sherman talks about um the sort of sequence of the sciences you have you
know physics which begets uh chemistry which begets biology which begets uh you know psychology and
sociology yeah right exactly that's the normal pyramid of order yeah so it's really important not to apply
to a more developed order like biology the rules of chemistry and yet we have you could say this
physics uh envy or physics centrism which attempts to apply to the biological world or lagrangian or a
theory of everything where it is somehow figure out a bowl when indeed there are emergent processes
that cannot be predicted from physics alone and this is a big problem for science because we've been
trying to for hundreds of years take the rules of newton take the rules of chemistry and apply them to
biology to human behavior right and so we're very good at this point of looking at the very small and the
very large and being quite accurate on a physics level but we're not very good at dealing with chemistry and i
you know i deal with uh the chemical harms to all life uh with a lot of my work i talk about chemical
colonialism yeah and the chemical anthropocene so we haven't quite understood how chemistry uh impacts biology
because we don't understand biology and we don't understand psychology and sociology in part because we
don't understand yeah biology and ecology i really like um or what i see when you when you talk about
it being relational um we did a couple videos sort of into the foundations of physics where you really
see sort of a a shift towards relational quantum mechanics so basically embracing carlo rovelli is
very known for it but there are all sorts of different flavors of this relational quantum mechanics but it
basically says that it's all about relations and we cannot even speak anymore about sort of um facts in the
world um crazy stuff and that shift is happening i think for the last 20 20 years it's been sort of
there from the from the beginning and when you mentioned sort of the founding fathers of quantum
mechanics but somehow in the 20th century also quantum mechanics went to insert of this shut up and
calculate mode right and sort of denied that sort of ontological questionnaire so we so we see it in physics
physics but how does it work and we know a little bit how it works in physics right when that we have
the measurement problem what's sort of the measurement problem in biology and how to to go about it and
i'm also want to hear you talk about participatory action research or becoming one with your your research
subject subject subject subject i should say of course sorry yeah so as you mentioned you know even
in physics um you see relativity playing a role so this goes back to an old you know heraclitus versus
parmenides battle uh the original the original schism you could say um and here you have uh you know
smolan at the perimeter institute yeah who's talking about um the laws of physics change over time
right maybe just a little bit here and there from our observed empirical analysis but if
there are changes to these constants then that means that we're living in a processual universe right
dennis noble also in biology has talked about biological relativity and this notion that we have
um the rules of of biology uh changing and that's why i am firmly in the camp of evolutionary uh um the
evolutionary uh synthesis um in biology the extended evolutionary synthesis um and ecological evolutionary
developmental biology these fields that over the last 40 years have developed showing the importance of
the hollow beyond the importance of epigenetics the importance of group selection even interspecies
selection rather than selecting just on the basis of an individual if we want to understand
uh how other organisms communicate in their national natural habitat which the field of ethology aims to
do we need to go and see how they do that so in brazil there's these dolphins that for 40 years
maybe 50 by now they have fished with local brazilian fishermen the dolphins will corral when they see the
fishermen coming out for what's it been um they you know early morning at dawn they the dolphins will
see the fishermen coming with their nets and will corral the fish to seriously the fishermen in brazil yes
uh this is super well documented over decades um and when the fish try to evade the dolphins they get caught
in the nets and so what's the fishermen get a lot more and the dolphins also get more of course you see
that not all the dolphins in that area participate there's some pods that do some pods that don't and
so it is a choice and it is a relationship that is multi-generational both with the human brazilian
fishermen and with the dolphins and so you see these new ways of symbiosis evolving
all around the world um interspecies relationships this is actually what i wrote my phd on um my
dissertations on interspecies uh discourse ethics interspecies communication and you know uh there's
another example um barbara smuts a ethologist who she was um following a group of primates uh along the
river and at one spot they just sat down for half an hour they were silent and still and just listening
they weren't grooming they weren't it was like they're meditating and she would have never caught
that if she was trying to get them to do something now she had spent months earning their trust being
accepted into their troop and then she got to have this magic moment with them and she saw this as the
culmination of understanding a different side of these primates than anybody else had ever a behavior
that had never been um uh observed before and this required deep humility so a sense of being humble
in the face of a science system that you don't understand deep listening so finding interspecies
these forms of listening and and when i hear you speak yogi it also sort of makes me think that
we're somehow trapped in these hierarchies in thinking in in all of our thinking but especially
when it comes to consciousness and um i think nice to go a bit oh yeah nice some tea
to go a bit into deeper into biosemiotics um and touching upon the notion of umwelt which is an
important one in biosemiotics and the the notion that um everyone perceive we cannot perceive reality
directly as it is right so but maybe first good question sort of just for lay audience what exactly is
biosemiotics great all right so semiotics is the understanding that there are different science
systems um that we all use and it's not reductive to writing or language um but also our gestures right
our looks uh facial uh expressions and biosemiotics builds upon this and says yes okay so the work
of charles sanders purse which we use his triadic model so saussure virgin and saussure is the
other semiotician this is sort of like the history of semiotics okay you have two the french and the
american okay and so the french is 19th century when we talk when it came up this is 19th 20th century
very rich time for science um and so what you have is uh in saussure's model you have sort of this
notion of coding and decoding so it's a uh it's a dualistic model charles sanders purse uh he was a
polymath um a very good friend of william james and he's the progenitor actually of the um pragmatist
movement of philosophy so he's the father of pragmatism as well as being the father of uh semiotics
um and so his triadic model shows that you have the interpreter that's us you have the object which
is there in the world and then you have our representation of it now we can't really get
to the object itself and this is um the the question of uh umwelt and umgebung which biosemiotics takes up
from uh from uh the estonian uh german um or or prussian um uh father of uh theoretical biology
jacob van uxkell and uxkell has this notion of the umgebung which he gets from kant as the absolute
reality now he's in the numinal world yeah now now he's in neo-kantian but he's not exactly a kantian and
mm-hmm because he uh does believe that that numinal world is not just um is not at the expense of or
exclusive of materiality it far extends beyond materiality but that he doesn't see a dualism
there right so um the umwelt on the other hand is our dashboard consciousness yeah right this is the
interface uh theory of perception uh that donald hoffman and others have developed and my colleague
and i uh brian cumalo uh we wrote a paper about hoffman's work and biopsy semiotics yeah and what
we showed is that there are many similarities because we both use this exculion model of umgebung absolute
reality and um umwelt which is our uh species specific um uh sensory constrained understanding
of what exists yeah and that every organism sees a different part of reality yeah as a different
dashboard yeah and insofar as we can become aware of any other organism either incarnate that i mean
in the material world or in the imaginal worlds insofar as we can become aware of them at all
that means that we are sharing some sort of umwelt there's some overlap yeah um and so the question
is a question of more or less rather than of yeah uh all or nothing that's super interesting because when
you say overlap what it triggers me i mean that this is like magic realism i mean you have also
written a paper about um what's it called the object-oriented ontology yeah that but also sort
of on a sort of magic realist notion that that sort of plants may have sort of drive us in a certain
direction but it's sort of that is magical thinking in a sense but when you say those umbelts overlap so
let's say a plant has an umbelt it has a sort of a notion of reality that we don't have access to
and then an animal interacts with that plant they their umwelts overlap in a way that we still don't
have access to but we overlap with the animal is there sort of a knowledge network then possible that
we that we sort of can get knowledge of of other umbelts through interaction with with animals get
information from plants so is that sort of the part of this biosemiotic way of thinking
absolutely um and so we would categorize this under applied biosemiotics um but you can absolutely
see the example of um in sri lanka and the 2004 um tsunamis that happened you know in southeast asia
killed over a hundred thousand people uh more and what you saw was the elephants
um on the coastal zones they broke free of they broke free from their shackles
and they headed for the hills and the people followed them before the tsunami this is of course
yeah hours before the tsunami and it saved tens of thousands of people's lives wow following the
elephants none of our um uh um seismographs none of our earthquake monitors were able to
uh detect that what you know what was coming nobody knew no human and none of our artifacts
of measurement based on the recursive human perceptions um knew what was going on but they
knew and by following them it saved tens of thousands of lives and there are um do we now understand how
or still not how they sort of we don't understand all the mechanisms um it could be air pressure changes
but here here's you know the t um what's going on is much more complex than we can compute
probably more complex than ai can compute and that is really hard for us to accept that's really hard
because we want to be masters of the universe we want to think that our science is um you know
unparalleled and uh it is the sine qua non we want to think that our machines are uh creating the deus ex
machina yeah and really what it all boils down to is we want to feel safe and we want to feel that we
actually know the world enough to find our place in it and from a colonial mentality the only way we know
how to do that is to make the world in our image right just like we've made god in our image um most
cultures at least um and so there's this recursivity to the the human or the sort of um uh atrophied
notion of what humans can be and then yogi sorry to interrupt but what a notion in your work what
what really struck with me was sort of the word semi-o side so that's the killing of science
killing of symbols so is sort of the way we treat nature uh species going extinct we're we are also
killing meaning makers that could have told us something absolutely yeah i mean there's this old
sean connery film called medicine man right he goes to the jungle he thinks he finds the cure for cancer
it's actually in the ants that he's that are in the sugar that he's using for the assays and it's
burning down and so we just burned down the amazon rainforest you know to i don't know graze cattle
for mcdonald's or whatever and these ants had the cure to cancer in them and he thought it was the
wrong thing he thought it was a different variable right he didn't even know that the ants were in the
sugar yeah which were actually doing doing the work and um every genocide is semi-o side you're
killing languages you're killing ways of seeing the world ways of being in the world you know when we
destroy olive trees that have been around for a thousand years we don't know what relations those
olive trees were were holding up on an ecological level but also on a semiotic one yeah every ecocide is
a semi-o side um when we talk about smaller more local uh intimate versions of this uh when we take
our old folks and we put them in old folks homes you know instead of being with family being in their
home that they grew up in or had the smells the familiarity right the extended cues in their environment
which allow them to navigate as their senses start to erode certain senses like smell might be able
to guide them but when you put them in a completely new habitat that's a form of semi-o side that's the
form of semi-o side and there are huge scientific losses now i don't think that that is the ethical
reason for not doing these things i think that that's the instrumental reason for not doing these things
but i think the ethical reason uh for not displacing people and beings and climate change is semi-o side
we have this question of assisted migration you know corals are bleaching because it gets too warm
when we disrupt these much slower processes and speed them up thousands of times more than their background
level uh of uh sort of migration would work because i think of all reality as an inhalation
and an exhalation and all these rhythms all these cycles all these processes have their own temporality
all their own rhythms that are intersecting interlocking but when we speed some of them up
it throws off all of them we know for a fact that when we heat up the ambient temperature
of a country that it makes the people there more violent that's a form of semi-o side when we
um you know cut down a forest where uh you know the celts were praying in and the druids had their
rituals with we are destroying an entire cycle between the trees and those people so even if none of
the actual human beings died their culture is is dead in in a very real way it's a form of semi-o side
and you see this actually used in warfare all the time in india there's these movements uh of people
who wrap themselves around trees that were going to be cut and it's been happening for like a hundred plus
years where people will protect trees from logging because of their relationships with the trees and
their ontology they realize we might have forgotten it but they haven't their ontology is bound up their
destiny their fate and suffering and joy is bound up with the continuation of their habitat and ecology
their web of relations makes them who they are beautiful it touches me because i i only recently
feel more connected with nature and to be quite honest it has been through the strongest connection
with nature came through psychedelic experiences i've had and thinking about it from from essencia
foundation's perspective a science perspective and i think we met even on a international conference
on psychedelic research right that's where we met initially i still remember interviewing
you see yulka and i titled our interview and this is sort of way of thinking as sort of model collapse
namely the fact that uh psychedelic substances in a certain way affecting our um what's it called the
the default mode network exactly sorry the default mode network breaks down our models of the world so
sort of our whole sort of umbelt mechanism or donald hoffman's dashboard sort of the dashboard making it
somehow breaks it down opening us up at least that's my that was my take on it opening us up more to
different umbelts and it has been like a deeply personal experience of mine on these substances and
then walking in nature versus sort of like in a normal waking consciousness what are your thoughts
here and how does it relate to your your concept of ecodelia and ecodelics
ecodelics um yeah my my preferred way of thinking about psychedelics is this this notion that in
psychedelics are not mind manifesting but they're ecology manifesting in this sort of
uh five ea cog sci notion of what our consciousness is made out of sorry five e the extended uh embedded
embodied inactive um ecological and affective uh cognition that we which which is our birthright um which
isn't in here it's not a homunculus you know driving a tractor called a human body it's you know we're
not just a meat suit um but we also are not the owners of our actions as uh you know robert sapolsky
and others talk about we are the result of vectors and all the vectors coming together in their various
directions lead to the result of us being thinking feeling who what we are so this this notion of
ecodelia with with you know trees and and walking in forests what we're talking about here isn't in a
more open aperture being able to surrender and feel all the weight that we've been carrying of performing
humanness performing some notion of the rational actor which doesn't allow us to tap into other
sensory channels which are always already there operating with us yeah but which the default mode
network has been fending off at all costs yeah and it's so funny because i had and i i'll just bring it
in and it might sign woo but i mean scientifically it's just a phenomenal experience i've had so just an
and is one experience i've had is that with a very specific tree in a forest that i very often visit
i always found the tree beautiful but it was on sort of a walk in nature with a small amount of
psychedelic substances that are i mean we live in that sense in a great country by the way it's good to
mention it in the netherlands it's completely legal here some some of these substances freedom of
consciousness yeah in a sense it is and it was only on these substances that i could connect on i felt a
deeper connection with a specific tree which i really felt as as love and coming back again coming down
so to speak immediately the judging mind the default mode network starts being active again ah okay that
was just the psychedelics that works and you create the story again of sort of feeling a deep intimate
love for a specific tree it's just sort of a psychedelic effect and not something more profound
and and my question to you is also thinking about psychedelic philosophy i mean aldous huxley made this
distinction between seeing the the the psychedelic experience as a window into a deeper realm of of
truth of reality or seeing it as a mirror just mirrors back and i see sort of this wouldn't say clash but
it's a debate also the icpr at the conference of psychedelic research between researchers who are much more on
on the mirror aspect safely saying it's just it's just what's already there and it shows it to you
so meeting that tree is just something has to do with my own psychology and now it's like stronger
and that other mirror sort of the the window on a deeper realm i myself am much more towards the window
sort of interpretation what are your thoughts here so we humans are obsessed with being loved by the
animate world by the more than human world because we have lost that animacy with ourselves we no longer
hallucinate gods all the time like maybe we did 8 000 years ago before our corpus callosum
connecting our left and left and right hemispheres of our brain got smaller right and the according to
ian mcgill crest uh you know the left hemisphere of knowing all the time being right dominating and
already having it all figured out started to um you know invert the roles instead of being the emissary
it became the master and it gets very sick in that way and ultimately sees everything just as a mirror
it's a hall of mirrors yeah you know a labyrinth that you can't get out of and the greeks knew about
this if you go back to you know uh the minotaur and icarus and daedalus and all these stories about
these labyrinths they're labyrinths of the mind and these labyrinths of the mind which um shackle us
to certain perceptions are based on things that we do not value fear uh resentment um smallness
cowardliness these are i don't think any culture worth its salt would say that these are things that
we want to inculcate into our children and at the same time you know when we say oh yeah love uh is
or the love for the tree um maybe it's not a mirror but maybe it's also not a window maybe it's a relation
now i'm not saying that if you're taking enough psychedelics you couldn't have be staring at a brick
wall and also have the same experience um but i personally in my life understand that ritual ceremony
with the more than human alive world in which we're snuggled with in which we feel comfortable in which we
feel at home allows us not just to project and also not just to receive but to connect
and it's this connection in the middle the relation which exists neither in our eye nor in the light
but is made through the intention and the also the commitment that comes with that because i'm sure
you know you know god forbid if uh somebody wanted to cut down that tree and you knew about it
beforehand you would try to protect that tree when you just said that example of people are protecting
a tree that's what triggered me to bring up the story because i thought if that would happen that
tree up jump on my bike right now yeah go to that tree and i'll lay in front of it and bring my kids
that is love and that is that is an emotion that leads to action if emotions lead to action they're
i would say genuine um dialogical uh experiences and connections if it doesn't lead to action
then i would say it might just be crocodile tears it might just be a projection or a desire that you
then fantasize about yeah but if it leads to action there's something there where there's been an exchange
um and of course we don't have to put it in uh you know our our scaffolding of uh known scientific
mechanisms but we also can be very clear that um there's a ton of research on nature connectedness
as i'm sure you know from the psychedelic world which they talk about yeah which um shows that if you
take a walk in a forest um if you are able to do that you know in the in japan they have shinrin yoku
forest bathing where doctors prescribe for various illnesses go be in a forest lie down breathe be there
for an hour feel all your emotions and i think that that is as healing for those forests as it is for the
patients that's interesting you really think it affects nature if we do it how could it not um our
our fear of feeling our own uh grief our own solastalgia as glenn albert albrecht calls it um
our fear of actually feeling the emotions which come with the degradation of our habitat
those lack of expression of feelings are keeping us in ecocide they're keeping us in this static
pattern yeah right we need to throw some uh some um some chaos yeah at it and that's what psychedelics
are really good at they're um non uh uh non localized amplifiers right i think that's gross definition i
don't know it sounds like very cool they're non-specific amplifiers yeah so if you are in
nature you are going to be more open to that yeah um and i think that psychedelics are always and you
know i don't want to say only but when we're not using them in nature we're not fulfilling their full
purpose and we're also short-sighted ourselves back into that hall of mirrors we're understanding those
imaginal realms as a mirror or as a window rather than a relation and that's why for example
if you're using psychedelics in the base you know say dmt in the basement and you happen to have a
you know a white supremacist ideology it's just going to reflect back to you that white supremacist
ideology because you're not bouncing it off anything else there's no connection you're just fantasizing and
about whatever is there to begin with so that's why it's a non-specific amplifier but these substances
have always been used in community in nature historically and they've been used to heal not
it's not about healing individuals like it's about healing the relationship between the human community
and the more than human world and that is what psychedelics are there for and when we heal that
relationship you know we may unlock whole nother stages and levels of what psychedelics can offer us
and we also might be able to unlock that without the psychedelics at all not that i you know would
ever want to forego that possibility but i do think that we can live in an ecodelic world and state
because all of this we're talking about states mind states uh states of a body of being right of
connection and when we're in these states it doesn't matter how we got there as long as we're listening
and vulnerable and open and surrendering to that part of ourself that's a nazi you know killing our
inner nazi um which is the default mode network which is restraining us from acknowledging the
synesthesia all the feelings they're constantly washing over us yeah we need to let those spirits go
instead of holding on to them and letting them make us into a meat puppet which i would say most of us
do most of the time right but if we want a little bit of free will we need to let go of our ideologies
we need to let go of our notion that we're right and we need to feel more uh the more than human world
the animate world which is our birthright for 98 of our existence we saw in every tree in every cloud
in every body of water we saw the goddess we saw the mystery we saw the part of ourself that you know
in greece they called it the demon that's on your shoulder that everybody else can see but the moment
you turn to look at it it goes somewhere else you can never see your own your own sort of spirit right
and when we can see through other species eyes ourselves so much of our insecurity in you know the
21st century as human beings goes away when we are scrolling through our black mirrors you know looking
for that dopamine release which of course is super hyper reductionist let's select wider what we're
actually craving is to be nestled in the branches or the roots of a tree we're craving to be seen by
the more than human world through the eyes of an other that we cannot understand and to feel seen
and to feel love and to see beauty we're looking for beauty we're all beauty junkies and that's what
nature and creation and the imaginal realms are the possibility for that but the more we are afraid of
that the more we create ugliness the more we create pollution the more we create uh ecocide genocide
semiocide and the more impoverished we get uh on a level of significance and meaning
so much depth here and the critical part of me though applying to me and nature and what i just
shared with you is that i do sometimes feel a sort of disconnect with the suffering in the world i happen
to live in a sort of a rich country i have a nice home i'm closely to nice nature in the netherlands
this is great sitting down with you having conversations like these there's a lot of
suffering in the world and i sometimes shut myself off from it and then to i feel that voice that says
sort of this is spiritual bypassing hunts also also in my work for essential thinking about analytic
idolism and i feel that sort of risk and i i'm just sort of openly exploring that for myself what
are your reflections there on sort of that notion of spiritual bypassing and all what you just said
well i i feel you on that because i hope that every single human being alive in a position of privilege
like we are um feels that schizophrenia yeah between a world which we you know we sort of larp
this learned helplessness of like oh no my government or these corporations are doing all this horrible
stuff all the way around the world and these you know global commodity chains have been set up that
you know just like export suffering everywhere um and we feel helpless so we just go back to our
job we go back to our family our little garden and on the one hand and we do our psychedelics once a
month yeah sure go to church right yeah um do our dancing yeah and on the one hand you know i would
say that's like the uh the exhale or the inhale depending on where you're at with it we have to be able
to live our lives and have the normalcy of believing that we're contributing to something greater even if it
doesn't look and feel like that right now and hopefully we are right because i don't think that
that's empty i don't think that that's empty and i really want everybody to feel that whatever they're
doing however small or local or um you know it is that there is also this fierceness this this sense of
resolve that i'm not just going to be um yeah opting out escapist right like uh douglas rushkoff you
know writes about in survival of the richest where you have all these half-baked ideas from um misled
billionaires who think that they'll be able to escape our common destiny yeah right um by having their
bat caves or their uh you know land in new zealand uh or their bunker and all this is you know
like uh i teach my students about this and i i think very young children understand that there is
no escaping our shared planetary destiny and that this is very serious and that we have to
do something about bruno latour has written extensively on this you also write like like
suffering is non-optional i wrote in one of your papers yeah so you have to convert the suffering into
beauty so to not feel the suffering is creating more suffering and so when we try to spiritually bypass
and try to you know plug our ears our you know eyes in our mouth and don't take our autonomy our god-given
sovereignty in the world as agents agents of change agents of upholding you know beauty truth and goodness
which i absolutely believe in as one just as socrates did when we neglect that responsibility then we
become what who who are we how can we have pride in ourselves how can we show up for our children our
family our community even our gardens right so there is this inhale exhale we in addition to have living
our small little lives intellectual white collar lives whatever it is um which i definitely you know
i protest less in the streets now than i did when i was 20. um do i feel like i'm getting soft no
but that's also because i'm very active in organizing with others because the data is clear by ourselves we
cannot affect government decisions because it's all about government government and governance you know
we ought to know all of our neighbors uh in theory and be able to say no we don't want this um liquor
store on our corner absolutely not we don't need another one of those go away no we don't want you
selling cigarettes to our kids go away exerting our no but we've become flabby we no longer take strong
stands and know how to be successful we don't know how to coalition build we infight amongst each other
saying oh well you don't have the same politics as me or you know you uh you know also like these
other things that are just tasteful so i'm not going to coalition build with you this is stupid
ineffective and it's nonsense yeah um so i see it as the two sides it's like seasons right we have seasons
in our lives where we organize with others to uphold the very fabric of our reality because
if we just do nothing and pretend that doing our work is enough in a time of emergency i would say
unequivocally with the metacrisis we are in a state of emergency how do we create non-rivalrousness
this is a concept that really um uh sort of naturalized from daniel schmachtenberger who has
really written and spoken about this eloquently we need to create a framework both with governments
and corporations and you know i'm writing a book about industrial epidemics industrial pandemics
and how they can be stopped and how we absolutely need to stop them but we can't blame
a corporation that's just doing what governments have said it can do we have to change the soup
we're swimming in and that's why i take an ecological approach to all of this right
we both need to not spiritually bypass and also not blame ourselves for the entire world and so
again it's neither cooperation nor competition all the way down it's always a mix so how do we deal
with all of this on a personal individual level we all will have different affordances different
semiotic scaffolding that give us opportunities for bravery and courage and i think that those
opportunities when we take them that's our destiny that's our dharma these are the moments where we feel
most alive where we're acting in concert uh hana arendt says this actually is freedom anything else
that you think of is freedom your own private being able to do whatever you want in your own private
realm that's not freedom freedom is acting in concert with your equals with your fellow citizens with your
fellow humans of the world with your interspecies allies um and so i really prefer to think of it as all
connected the ecodelic work the um the work that we're doing to try to change consciousness and
rationality what does that mean to change what science is for and what's it supposed to do in our
current culture how to sort of disentangle the instrumentalization of technoscience from actual
scientific inquiry where truth is the main focus i see this as all part of it it's necessary but not
sufficient only we in our own lives will know those moments of kairos stepping out of the the chronos of
doing our daily tasks where we're like this is why i'm alive this is my purpose this is what i'm supposed
to do and acting and coming together and it's such a hard thing for us to even think about because
it's so scary because things have gotten so extreme in every way you know we feel so disempowered so
much learned helplessness where we've forgotten how to communicate with people we disagree with
we've forgotten how to mend our shoes or do basic things that people all around the world know how to do
because they have to and so part of the comfort that we have has also made us weak and i don't mean
that in any sort of like you know toxic masculinity sort of way i mean it in terms of uh an intellectual
weakness which disengages from the world around us talking about sort of that the the the metaphysics
the thinking behind it the crisis of reason behind it because um i see sort of a tendency
in some writers and thinkers to sort of just equate everything we see with nature and and you've
written about something i mean naive materialism in a sense that matter as small building blocks being
fundamental in our universe is becoming sort of a minority position intellectually right to really
uphold that then you really shouldn't read quantum mechanics and you shouldn't read sort of what
neuroscientists are telling us you should definitely shouldn't read your work as well so that's sort of
a minority position but there are these other flavors of materialism or physicalism i'd call them
that are still quite widespread and i was fascinated by reading about one of them called it called object
object-oriented ontology ontology that you write about and you critique um i was just curious how
that how you see sort of how that plays into the dynamics we now see worldwide also thinking about
stuff like ai because if you have an an ontology a metaphysics that tells you there is no difference
between an animate and the inanimate world that sort of also enables you to spend billions of dollars on
developing ai that can be disastrous on on many levels but to just say it's all nature and this
is just i'm just playing my role in evolution right so what is the big the battle of the stories the battle
of the metaphysical stories right now that you see playing out worldwide geopolitically wow sorry big
question but but um so uh you're referring to my article in the journal zygon um in which i critique
object-oriented ontology and other forms of speculative realism um on a biosimiotic basis
and i do this in part because there's a lot of ethical and logical flaws in it which i enumerate
um but first what is it right sure so object-oriented ontology is this notion that objects speak
to us uh whether it's a you know a glass or a table or a cashew or you know a plant or
you know a cloud right and this is a a form of uh i would say truncated like cut short apophania
so apophania is seen things uh seen life where there is none and pareidolia is like where you see faces
in the clouds yeah and so if you look at evolutionary biology and psychology um if you see a false positive
right a face in the clouds or a face in the bushes where there isn't one and your cortisol levels spike
for a second but nothing happens and then they can go back down um it's not much of a risk to your
existence however if you have a false negative where there's you know a face of a jaguar or a crocodile
or a hunter right or you know as we say in our current uh discourse a man or a bear
then if you don't see it you're dead so we are prone to hallucinate all the time into you know a
shadow moves and we move however in our current world we take everything as a threat whether it's a
comment on facebook or you know we as an existential threat it becomes that sort of face in the bushes
that we perceive to be real and if there's too many of those all the time our cortisol levels spike
and it actually becomes a degenerate response rather than an evolutionarily helpful one right becomes
evolutionary uh uh non-advantageous and so object-oriented ontology um says that you know
objects speak to us but it doesn't talk about who's to interpret them it doesn't talk about the question
of interpretation at all it makes lists and assemblages it's sort of like bad delusion uh uh you know
phenomenology um let's assume for a moment that our dashboard is zero sum you want to open some
channels over here maybe some other channels over there are going to become garbled so you can't be
open to everything all the time yeah no being no organism can that's sort of the omniscient uh positing
of of god or of oneness and wholeness right where there is no opposition and so how do we deal with
these connections to the world around us well object-oriented ontology tells us that you know
some people have privileged access to the nomina basically and and these are the people that sort
of build ais or well so that's an interesting question uh the relationship between object-oriented
ontology and you could say test realism which is this sort of long-termism idea that came out of the
really uh you know um yeah a poorly understood notion of utilitarian utilitarianism or effective
altruism which thinks that you know if we just increase the amount of um happiness in the most vague
bland uh general terms that the world's a better place yeah right with no distinctions at all right
just happiness is this thing so first of all nobody who is actually happy seeks for happiness
nobody actually wants happiness we want meaning not happiness so that's a non-starter to begin with
but the notion that the universe will be happier if we destroy the entire world if we sacrifice all of
humanity and the earth and we create a bunch of virtual bots in sufficient numbers that have sufficient
levels of consciousness uh that their happiness is greater than all the beings on earth and that's
it end of story and then we win and you know this fairy tale is actually a nightmare because a lot of
people actually believe in this and they're trying to create the end of the world where we all sort of
upload our consciousness yeah this really taps into have you read sort of shoshana zuboff's work her
sort of analysis of the hyper capitalism or what's it called sort of surveillance capital
surveillance capital sorry yeah that's the word and and what we have here on the one hand is we have
these um millenarian christians who want to um you know create war in the middle east so then um you
know basically using israel as a a pawn in their own scheme so then they can ascend and create the apocalypse
and so you have them on the one hand working hand in hand with these ai people uh in silicon valley
who have equal delusions but they're pretending to be atheists rather than religious they're pretending
to be utilitarianisms where they're praying to this um this god of their own making right this moloch
of um of silicon that they think they'll get agi out of which will never happen because all life
according to biosemiotics has a digital component and an analog component you have digital codes and analog
they just want digital they think that ones and zeros is enough that you can get to actual
consciousness from ones and zeros and biosemiotics is bollocks there's absolutely no way that that's
ever existed and could not be because you need an analog dimension to interpretation itself because
that's how meaning is made so you you might have a thing that does a simulation of you know increasingly
well almost impossible to distinguish but like who cares why why all this effort to just deceive
because you're not actually creating consciousness you're not actually creating life you're not
actually creating something that's meaningful you are creating a servant you're creating more slaves
so then you can do away with human labor you can do away with human meaning you can silence people
it's just more weapons basically um and these are not the tools that we actually need in our tool
build because as i'll remind you eo wilson famously said we are living with paleolithic emotions medieval
institutions and god-like technologies and it's the mismatch between these which is driving
all the problems so i would say nope we need a grand moratorium on all technological development
until we fix our institutions and we deal with the fact that our unfelt unmet emotions are driving
this whole thing we are being meat puppets because we're not actually taking account internally or
externally or in the other realms of who is sucking our blood what vamp what creatures have we let become
vampires because we're not aware of them when they could be our allies
we need to feel again you said that's the only way that we will survive is through acknowledging
that most of our so-called rationality most of our so-called science and technology and
almost all of our government and governance is being driven by at this point dysbiosis in our um
in our world in our existence and the only way to access that is through feeling and
in you know asher walden's work on uh the symbiotic ecology
in the imaginal realms right he's talking about psychedelics psychedelic experience and we meet
all these other creatures and if we are not able to acknowledge this ecology this invisible these
invisible realms and to make peace to make to harmonize our relations we must meet our own fear we
must meet our own feeling and sense of inadequacy which makes us strive for never having enough right
we can never have enough in our current culture and what we find when we get to a moment of sufficiency
is sufficiency not through being rambo but through our network of relations creating an ecology a habitat
both through our family and friends our community but also being able to eat from our surroundings
having nowhere to get clean water know where we can make our own electricity know where we can
have plants and develop intergenerational projects of food forests you know permaculture
or eco villages all all of this that will allow us to relax this notion that we have to prepare for
the apocalypse all the time which is burdening every human being's consciousness and actually
all the other organisms too because we're mowing down the amazon we're mowing down um i just read
jean baptiste feroz's book more and more and more about uh energy symbiosis where we have never
gone through an energy transition we're using more wood than ever more coal than ever more oil and gas
and so going to renewables is not going to solve the story we need to reduce the amount of waste in our
the invention of pollution needs to also have a cap where the end of pollution yeah i
want to zoom out with you like to sort of really high metaphysical level hearing you talk and um
there's a lot of things that i that i think first of all i have this fascination through reading your
work but also my own research into sort of biology having interviewed michael levin for instance on how
we can be inspired in and when you talk about the inhale and the exhale sort of and and you could
also say sort of this this boundary we have to somehow keep up you know evolution has taught us
in my own world to sort of keep my models going my default mode mode network helps me to sit here
down with you have this conversation on the same time it hinders me sometimes to sort of feel so i mean
this constant search of sort of models that i build up and and sort of strengthen my my my my membrane
and sort of being porous and feeling and since this dance and cells are very good at it sort of they know
how to how to just do it and sometimes billions of years of practice and it's super interesting and but
zooming out this taps also of course into the director of our foundation bernardo castrop's work on on
seeing sort of the universe a mind at large that dissociates itself into alters um a metaphor is of
course cells sort of like it's the first time that sort of anthropically we see sort of chemicals a
bunch of chemicals that say okay we're gonna do this a membrane and now there's an inside and outside there
was just this this entropic soup and somehow we're sitting here as sort of two cells build up of cells and
we're in this constant dance so i'm sort of curious at your sort of end ontology on all of this do you
also suppose a mind at large that somehow does this and you already gave us a lot of tips on how to dance
but i'm just curious what your thoughts are these are sort of my philosophical reflections hearing you talk
so uh to ask you another question back i'm curious how you or you know bernardo castrop sees this
mind at large um you know what are the contours of it does it breathe uh you know does is it parmenidian
or heraclitian uh is it processual that's super interesting the first thing i'd say is that it is not
self-aware it is not how bernardo would call it meta cognitive as we are which helped me but i think
this would be a great conversation between you and bernardo me personally what really helped me was
i have a christian background and and and reading carl gustav jung's answer to job was like the most
important book i read it was a tip by bernardo who said i should read it and it was like a complete
upside down of how i understood understood sort of the book of job in the bible which sort of in my
dutch reformed upbringing was told like the story of god ways are uh mysterious right god has this
master plan and it involves suffering and who are we to call out god for for the suffering we have to
endure and then jung says no job is an incarnated being who has to who has this sort of experience of
the suffering that yahweh and the story himself does not have and even it's it's pure blasphemy if you're
like what jung does because he says yahweh is not aware he's not aware of what he's doing even in
the story satan instead of sort of you know he comes up with the whole deal with god to to give
the suffering to to job inflicted on job is even satan is more aware of what's happening in the creation
than than yahweh and this story and um so i'd say i now am
i'm i'm much on that jung reading that there is this sort of mind at large sort of this oneness
that i do think is in some sense conscious but very different than we and it needs us to report
back and i mean a lot of religious traditions talk about sort of the divine incarnating into this sort of
dance of existence and to me it's meaningful because now my suffering my subjective experience of
the world has meaning because it has meaning to to to give back to the universe to just cry out
sometimes or um i guess that's that's that's my ontology i don't know sure if it helps an answer
to your question yeah so when when you said you know there's this reporting back i think that that's
a really important aspect how do we report back what are ways that um we take time on a regular basis to
report back and what does that mean and look like you know and catholicism part of its confession
and confession isn't just the words and deeds it's also the emotion it's also feeling the things that
are keeping us back that we're hating ourselves for it's the guilt yeah right yeah i have a catholic
mother so you know i know a little bit about this um and and this this notion of guilt and uh i'm wrong
and you know that you have to like uh whip yourself you know for your horrible deeds and the idea that
that's not going to actually allow you to evolve further that's going to keep you in a stuck model
yeah and i think that we have exported this suffering to the world like this stock model of like
oh i have to be guilty for all these things uh which is keeping us in these stuck patterns of the sides
right yeah um now to just modulate to buddhism right there's this notion that the four noble truths
and so suffering is non-optional part of existence for all living beings as far as you know all incarnate
beings all imaginal beings which are beings right rather than oneness as long as you have a
differentiated consciousness in any such way even if consciousness is intertwined and interdependent
as long as you have any sort of differentiation into a sense of self there's suffering now you have
maybe imaginal realms where suffering has different subtleties and layers um but we are incarnated on
this planet and instead of seeing this planet as a bunch of pieces of bullshit that we're supposed to
transcend or it's not important or it's a lesson or a task which are all delay and distantiation
things it's all a non they're all tactics to not feel to not confront ourselves with the preciousness
and the beauty of what is here now yeah and these are all that's satan for me that's you know that's
the the the sin of not being able to value and cherish and care for uh the the the life and what we are
given it's a rejection of now and here it's rejection of being and it's a hating in fact of incarnation it's
a hating of the material and i think that is an absolute mistake because that will never produce
a society of peace or of love or of happiness in any of these ways but least of all will it create a
society with meaning because if we reject actively and we're actively spending so much energy rejecting
reality as it shows up to us our umwelt yeah yeah that is allowing us maybe one five ten percent max
of being who we could be right and responding because we're afraid all the time because we think it doesn't
matter so it's a a priori rejection of reality as it's showing up to us and in buddhism they say
you know um if you have to suffer make it beautiful devote it for something greater you know and understand
when when you have correct understanding of our interdependency of our uh um of our interdependent
co-arising then you know that your destiny your salvation is bound up with the salvation of all
living beings everywhere in all time seen and unseen in all possible realms and dimensions and once you're
there the present moment is everything and as intense as the emotions are the feelings
you feel them because you realize that not feeling them would create more suffering and then this is
like pro tip right bonus level to create beauty out of the suffering right to create beautiful works of
art to create uh forests like the amazon rainforest um through terra preta for 5 000 years indigenous people
taught each other how to super low heat burn their bio compost to retain the minerals in the soil
during the flood season so that they could have more abundance and they helped create the amazon
rainforest as it was this is beauty creating their amazon rainforest where you know the most biodiverse
place on earth that is creating beauty out of suffering wow and a final question yogi on a personal level
could you share a little bit on on how you in your personal life through your what you call your
echidemic practice have transcended or or sort of created this beauty out of your own suffering
i've transcended nothing and i every day second guess and doubt myself and um and then i i move then i play
music then i hug my partner i play with my child i go outside and go for a walk i feed my chickens i have a
thought and i write it down i correspond with academics all around the world i meet with people like you
you you know i read some wisdom of the ages in a book i have tea ceremony by myself or with others i
allow myself to both inhale and exhale and not resent either one and not to identify with either my best
or my worst you know i just won a big grant yesterday i told you awesome and i'm i'm very happy about
that and at the same time i've lost i have not won more grants than i've won and that is life and so to
be able to create enough of a container to hold the roller coaster of life the um yeah the the highs and
the lows that is only possible for me with the more than human world with my web of relations
and to really live in ecodelic biosemiotic uh existence and learning new things all the time like
my son was interested in archery so i've started learning archery with him and that itself is something
that greatly needed that just pure focus um of a target and if you go too much to the right then
you need to overcompensate and go further to the left in order to hit the bullseye yeah and so i you
know i am far from accomplished in the ways of being able to ride high but i'm grateful enough to be able
to express the full range of emotions um you know i had an accident a few weeks a few months ago that was
probably the worst accident in my life and you know my son he was afraid i was gonna die and um
i just had to breathe through the whole thing you know i had to accept and use all the knowledge from
you know my yoga teachers and everything to rehabilitate myself um because nobody could do it
for me of course people could help me of course i yeah asked for help and received uh you know
medical care and healing and all that um you know the prayers of my my parents you know but um
in the end i had to deal with all the blockages in my mind in my emotions and in my physical body
and with my rep web of relations the people in my life and i still battle with uh resentment and other
emotions that are strong in my lineage that i received you know um and both through life experiences and uh
perhaps uh you know uh through genetics i don't know we we are given whatever you know hand of cards we have
but the sort of um i i say that i have like a metaphysically i have a um a tripod that supports
me and one of those is uh buddhism like vipassana one is taoism i've had been very blessed with taoist
masters teachers and one is a indigenous uh ritual ceremony plant medicines uh that have brought me to
a place where um i can feel on a very deep level um all the sadness of the world and not get caught up in
it and i can feel all the beauty in the world and not get caught up in it and i do get caught up in
both sometimes and also to not get caught up in that thank you so much joey thank you hans yeah
thank you for your openness and your heartfelt wisdom and i think it's also a we've had a beautiful
conversation that also is very much about what essencia is about in a sense that it is i mean
we've started off analytically talking about sort of you know science and doing the thinking and just
being critical thinking and using the faculty of mind which is which is beautiful but which has its
limits but can free us in a sense and i think in one of the statutes of our foundation it says that the
the the mind can be the or the head can be the bouncer of the heart that sort of can be wrong
thinking that sort of prevents us from connecting with our heart and some people are blessed with
more direct access to the heart and i don't have such a strong mind but i sense for someone like you
are you're obviously highly intellectual so you are a thinker and then to think yourself free to think
beauty to think i i find that beautiful and it's it's what our foundation is about so i'm just super
happy we can share your with wisdom with all of you watching and um yeah thanks again for that yogi
and uh we will make sure to because you reference a lot of authors and thinkers i'll i think we should
have contact to share those in the descriptions below this video so you can just sort of explore the
wealth of all the wisdom shared in this conversation thanks so much for watching this interview and
please come and ask questions that we can follow up on you uh you're close by so if you like this we
could sit down and have a sure follow-up discussion i'd love to do so thanks yogi thanks so much for
watching and see you in one of our next videos
