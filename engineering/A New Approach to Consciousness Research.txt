So, my name is Asher. I am a QRI collaborator in various different ways, which we will see
in this presentation. My background is in analytic philosophy, primarily in suffering
reduction and sentience research. I've been doing a PhD for six years, and it's still
ongoing that should be finished pretty soon, hopefully. And yeah, this talk is basically
an overview slash introduction to the particular research approach that QRI takes for, I guess,
research in phenomenology, and then looking at how that informs consciousness research.
And also, I wanted to say I have a surprise at the end of this talk, so definitely stick
around a really cool surprise announcement. Also, hopefully this doesn't lose too many
favorite points, but would it be possible for someone to shut that door just in case there's
like a siren that goes off? Because yeah, I'm recording the presentation. Amazing.
And yeah, one more thing I'd like to say is, yeah, maybe just before we start, if we can
all kind of take a moment to just feel into our sensations, how we're feeling at the moment,
I can give a brief qualitative report on myself. I'm feeling somewhat stimulated. I've had a
few cups of coffee and I just had a Coke Zero, which has some caffeine. I'm feeling a bit
overheated, feeling a bit nervous because there's so many eyes in front of me. And yeah, this is
a talk that I'm really excited to share. It touches on some really exciting ideas. But yeah,
otherwise feeling pretty happy and excited to actually get through it and then discuss it all
with you. So yeah, this will come up later. But basically just a phenomenology kind of reading of
how are you feeling and see if you can just like lean into certain sensations and explore them. And also
throughout the talk. So I should also note, this is the third time I've done this talk.
This is the most updated version. The first time was actually with Andres a few weeks ago at the
Borderland, which is a Swedish burn. This is my second Borderland. I think it was his first Borderland.
We had like a pretty amazing turnout. And that was just like a very kind of loose, you know,
how to write rigorous kind of reports of exotic states of consciousness kind of workshop. We had a lot
of people turn up. And I didn't have any slides. I did have my my iPad there with my notes. But then
I was in Berlin immediately after the burn. And rather than decompressing fully, I decided,
okay, I'll do this talk again, but I'll do it more properly. So I gave it at the, this is yeah,
also from a few weeks ago at the QRI Berlin meetup. And this is the third time I'll be doing it.
So anyway, just some brief housekeeping, housekeeping before we begin. So by consciousness,
I'm referring to phenomenal consciousness. Can I have a show of hands of like how many people
have heard of that term before? Yeah, so roughly, maybe half. So phenomenal consciousness refers to
the raw qualities or properties that make our subjective experiences feel the way that they do.
Other descriptions emphasize the the what it is likeness of being in a particular moment of
experience or of having a first person perspective. And it's important to note, and this is one of the
reasons that QRI exists as an institution is that we, we don't know what consciousness is,
it's completely absent from our models of reality at this current point in time. And to the extent that
consciousness actually exists, and it's not just a leaky abstraction from our models of reality,
this is a serious epistemic problem. I think consciousness exists. It's one of the
foundational axioms for my entire doctoral dissertation. So I'm going to, I'm going to
assume this is this is a real thing, and we have to understand it better. Also valence, valence refers to,
you might have heard this talked about in the context of effective state or hedonic tone, but valence
refers to the intrinsically positive or negative quality of conscious experiences. And common examples would
include, say, pleasure and pain, euphoria and dysphoria, happiness and unhappiness, and many other such emotions.
As you can see in this diagram, taken from Principia Qualia, valence is not a binary property, so some
experiences, you know, obviously feel better or worse than other experiences. There's also significant variation
between different valence states of consciousness. And it's important to note that because consciousness is missing
from our models of reality, we also don't know what valence is. And valence is a property of phenomenal
consciousness. And to this extent, or to the extent that valence has a normative value, which is
essentially to say that it's important to consider in our actions, you know, we typically think, you know,
unnecessary suffering is a bad thing to cause to another being, unless we have, you know, overriding
reasons, which, yeah, to the extent that it has normative value, this is a serious ethical problem,
that we don't even know what this thing is. You know, we have a lot of sophisticated ethical
theories. And this is my background, actually, in animal welfare research, we have a lot of like
models of things that are, you know, highly correlated with, I guess, like, what we expect would be like,
you know, suffering or various valence states of consciousness in certain contexts for different
organisms or for different people, but we don't actually know what it is. So yeah, understanding
what both consciousness and valence are, and also how we can directly interface with them is one of
the core missions of the Qualia Research Institute. So can I also get a show of hands who here has heard
of phenomenology? Oh, wow, actually, okay, so yeah, more people than phenomenal consciousness, seemingly.
Yeah, so phenomenology is a philosophical tradition that began in the early 20th century,
primarily with the works of German philosopher and mathematician Edmund Husserl,
along with various other European philosophers such as Max Scheller, Martin Heidegger,
Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponte. Phenomenology as a discipline of philosophy aims to
investigate the structure of different varieties of conscious experience, such as thought, emotion,
desire, imagination, expressed through various different sensory modalities. And modern approaches to
phenomenology, such as neurophenomenology, you can see this is an excellent paper I would recommend
on the subject, strongly emphasize or look for correspondences between first-person and third-person
data, using modern scientific methods, and like theoretical tools such as differential geometry,
topology, vector field analysis, dynamical systems theory, non-linear flow, you know, various things
that didn't maybe exist when Husserl initially embarked on the project of establishing phenomenology
as a research practice. But in the time since Husserl's writings, phenomenology, it hasn't actually
really advanced that much. Like there are certainly, you know, papers like this, and then there are like
lots of other stages that are, you know, substantial or significant in its development as a field,
but still a lot of people haven't heard of it. I suppose there's a selection effect in this audience
with so many people having heard of phenomenology before. So, but usually when I use the term people
are like, oh, hold up, you know, what is this big bundle of letters that you've thrown at me?
So yeah, QRI's approach to phenomenology strongly emphasizes investigating non-ordinary or exotic
states of consciousness. And by exotic or non-ordinary, I mean states of consciousness
which fall outside of the set of ordinary human experiences. You know, those which were recruited
by natural selection because they have or had a useful signaling function given our evolutionary history,
given some basic assumptions about the conditions under which we evolved and consciousness evolved.
So we think that looking at, you know, altered states is somewhat neglected,
not only in phenomenology, but just more broadly in consciousness studies. And to give a brief example,
just imagine if, you know, chemistry had restricted itself to analyzing matter at room temperature,
you know, we think it would have made little theoretical progress. So you can concede with like,
imagine two chemists in like the 17th century and they're both studying H2O and they, you know,
want to build a model of water. And one of them only studies it at room temperature and has like,
you know, a really sophisticated model and it has, it perfectly explains the behavior of the
phenomenon that they're looking at. But then the other chemist is like, oh, hold on, I'm going to heat
the water up or I'm going to cool it down. I'm going to play with the temperature parameter. And then you
see when you heat it up, you know, it turns into a gas and you can observe a phase transition and then
you pull it down and it turns into a solid. You know, we would think that the second chemist
would have a better model of the phenomenon. And that's because they're actively looking for
non-ordinary states, I guess, like of matter, and then they're updating their model based on that.
So yeah, QRI's approach is basically, we should be looking actively for edge cases of human
experience outside of room temperature consciousness to better inform our models of consciousness.
So for example, you know, we could look at advanced meditative states, such as like,
I don't know if anyone's heard of the jhanas before or cessation experiences. We could also look
at, you know, more generally extreme emotional or physical experiences that humans experience in
everyday life. But perhaps one of the most significant tools we currently have for studying
consciousness through this method are psychedelics. So at the moment, there's a lot of data on exotic
states of consciousness, such as those induced by psychedelics, on platforms like Erewid, Blue
Light, Psychonaut, Wiki. There are lots of trip reports that you can read about, you know,
these platforms are free and have been available for a very long time. Some of them are very fascinating.
But unfortunately, the quality of the phenomenology that you find on these platforms is often very poor.
And it's difficult to extract the right signal in order to, say, update your model correctly about,
you know, the exact character or the texture of certain states of consciousness that might result
from like taking, you know, like 4-H-O-M-E-T, for example, or, you know, whatever other kind of
psychoactive compounds are being researched or just like written about on those forums.
Has anybody heard of this classic QRI post?
Yeah, one, maybe a few. Awesome. Yeah, this is one of my favorites. So I would highly recommend
checking that out. You can see it's on qri.org slash blog slash rigorous dash reports.
Like there are many different ways we can improve the quality of phenomenological research,
especially when applied to studying psychedelics and other such compounds. But the main problem that
we have is that we tend to focus on describing the semantic or intentional content of our experiences
rather than their phenomenal content. So you can consider that experiences have
structural content. So I would define this as the rudimentary properties, such as, you know,
shapes, patterns, textures that make up individual moments of experience, looking at like the most basic
indivisible properties of conscious experiences and trying to kind of describe them both within
individual moments of experience and how they evolve over time. And then there's the representational
content. And these are basically like semantic concepts that one might use to characterize these
properties at high levels of abstraction. And so here's a quick example that I made. It's a bit silly,
but yeah, hopefully you get the idea. So yeah, imagine this isn't, you know, it's a thought bubble,
but just imagine this represents my conscious experience in a given moment. And I'm seeing something that
like, you know, a representational analysis would say, oh, it's a smiling cat, of course. But if I'm a really good
phenomenologist, then I'm going to want to try and give maybe like a mathematical analysis of the
the different shapes and, you know, maybe the different angles. So I could say right and left
isosceles, triangles, each containing a smaller triangle, middle, center, horizontal ellipse,
and then there are three lines. And then I can list the degrees that they seem to appear to me in that
moment. So this would be like one example of trying to take a more structured approach to,
I guess, analyzing the phenomenal character of moments of experience. And yeah, it's also important
to note that, like, why do we take this approach? Or why do we think this is relevant to like doing
high quality research? Well, it's because you can have an arbitrary number of experiences that encode
the representational content of a smiling cat. But when you're giving a description of an experience
at a structural level, or if you're trying to give like a, you know, mathematical analysis of like
the exact shapes and the relationship between the different components, this like heavily
constrains the set of possible experiences you could be having. So I mean, we're still not like
perfectly, you know, with our words, we're still not perfectly capturing what we want to capture,
which is like the what it is likeness of being in a particular moment of experience.
But we are like heavily constraining it. Yeah, so at QRI, we believe the best way to understand
subjective experiences involves analyzing their structural rather than their representational content.
And then I'll just give a few more examples as well. So an example of a trip report you might read
would be that focuses on the structural content would be the ceiling was tessellated with a highly
detailed texture organized along the 632 wallpaper symmetry group. More so, this tessellation was
dynamic and that all of the shapes were shifting and morphing. And symmetry group is like refers to
like a basically it's a mathematical concept to describe like there are a finite number of ways
in which like a repeating pattern across the surface can you can transform its shape and maintain its
structure. And so yeah, there are a finite number of symmetry groups and this is like quite a precise
account of exactly, you know, what is the say in this case the visual experience of searing at the wall.
Another example.
The left part of my visual field had a vertical wall I was attending to with peripheral vision.
The wall felt like it was about one meter to my left and at a right angle. This hallucinated wall
was vibrating at around eight hertz and had two alternating layers that looked about one centimeter
apart. One blue and one yellow. The colors were alternating at about half the speed at which
the wall was vibrating. So yeah, this is another good example especially because yeah, it tries to capture
you know, like the frequency of the the vibrations over time. So this would refer to you know, not just
taking a single frame and analyzing it but looking at you know, how qualia change over time. And then
just like one more, this is an example I really like is referring to a positively valent 5-MeO-DMT experience
which I'll talk about later. I could not point out where in my experience the positive feeling was
located suggesting global rather than local coherence. Additionally, while the information
content of the experience was extremely low, the feeling of connectedness was extremely high. I
remember observing this as I was coming up and coming down from the peak. The perception of
synchrony between different sensory modalities directly mapped onto the perceived intensity of my
experience. So yeah, so this is the kind of this is the kind of research we want to or not not
encourage but this is the kind of research we would like to in a very safe and responsible manner
like actually you know grow because we think this has like a non-trivial likelihood of actually
advancing our understanding of what kind of thing consciousness is looking at it from the inside.
So yeah, other relevant information for writing high quality phenomenology reports might include
say basic demographic information such as age, sex and ethnicity. You might include health information
such as how you were feeling in the time leading up to the experience, how well you slept the night
before in addition to say like general familiarity with with exotic states of consciousness. A good example
would be like I'm not sure how many people have experienced cannabis for the first time or the
hundredth time or the thousandth time but like it really changes you know the the more experience
you have with a certain state of consciousness. You know you could consider it almost like a different
drug. So that kind of information is useful if you're you know hypothetically if you're writing a
trip report and you want to be as exact as possible. It's also important to include information about
what substances are consumed and in what doses. You could say the method of intake as this like
drastically changes you know how fast something might absorb and how quickly changes to your experience
might be noted. You can also note yeah say at what time you started noticing subjective effects and
variability in its intensity at different stages of the trip in order to more precisely kind of plot
different phases such as you know the come up the peak and the come down. This is a cool diagram from
a paper neural correlates of the DMT experience assessed with multivariance EEG and yeah and this one
it was published in 2019 and participants were asked to provide minute-to-minute ratings of the subjective
intensity of NNDMT. So as you can see there's significant differences between the group that were
administered the DMT and then the placebo group which is what you'd expect hopefully. Again
consciousness is real you know like we're actually doing something when we take these substances. So
yeah you could also consider your methods or like the quality of your methods for attempting to capture
information about these states. So most people who I've talked to who write trip reports tend to wait until
the next day when they're feeling you know a bit more back to normal before attempting to capture
information about their state of consciousness. But it's actually important to note that the longer
you wait the more information gets compressed. It's similar to I don't know if any of you have
the experience of you know having like a really vivid amazing dream and you know you're kind of like
you you wake up from it but you still have your eyes closed and you can just really picture
certain like aspects of the dream. I often have the experience of like I will create characters in my
dream and I can still imagine their faces but only when my eyes are closed you know as soon as I open
my eyes the world floods in and then it's just like it's it's gone and I just lose that access.
And so yeah trying to kind of like minimize the distance between I guess recording the information
and maybe an analysis of the experience and the experience itself that can help. I personally like
to use like for dream journaling like I have an audio recorder on my phone so now I don't even have to
you know open my eyes and write things down. But yeah also I think yeah the more you do these kinds
of things like also like a dream dream journal the the more experience you get the more skills you get
and the easier it becomes. So finally something this might seem a bit like left field or maybe I'm like
biased because my background is in analytic philosophy. But yeah it's really important I
think to state one's philosophical background assumptions before like I guess writing an analysis
or interpreting their experience in the context of say a report. So this is like a basic example
of the relevance of background philosophical assumptions would be direct versus indirect realism
about perception. These are some really cool diagrams that I really like this slide.
But yeah so a direct realist might speak about directly accessing intrinsic properties of the
external world within their experience and an indirect realist assumes that the relationship
between their experience in the external world is contingent. In other words that relationship is not
necessary so it's you know the mapping could be different. On the slide here you can see diagrams of
two such theories of visual perception. So one illustrates Euclid's refinement of the Pythagorean
extramission theory which posits that visual experiences are the direct product of observers
literally scanning their environments with visual rays. This is like quite a popular theory for you
know some some hundreds of years I guess in like ancient Greece. And the second is from Stephen Lahar
who isn't from ancient Greece or you know is still alive and well. And he posits that visual experiences are
literally volumetric gestalt representations of external objects implemented within a warped space
resembling a bubble world. So yeah like what am I saying with that? It sounds crazy. I'm not going to
elaborate. I would recommend reading Q Clippers post series introducing Stephen Lahar's work if you're
interested in learning more on smoothbrains.net. So yeah check that out. But Lahar is like a very
like yeah fantastic researcher with regard to you know kind of studying not only visual perception but
just like more broadly how experience kind of you know shapes itself in order to represent the external
world. But the point I'm making in this is like more general and I think can be applied to any given
modality of experience. So in the context of talking about trip reports, if you read a trip report written
by a direct realist that says something like, I tasted the sweet golden color of laughter. You can
assume they really mean it. Like laughter has a golden color and this color has a sweet taste and
they accessed it directly. But then conversely an indirect realist might interpret this phrase as
the parameters of my internal world simulation were altered so that when I laughed this triggered my
visual field to erupt into a brilliant golden light. What's more it seemed I could taste this golden
light. It had a soft and sweet texture like powdered sugar but the sensation was not local to the mouth
region of my body map. Rather it occurred everywhere within my visual field where this golden light
permeated suggesting the formation of multimodal gestalts. This isn't a real trip report. I literally just made
this up to demonstrate a point but it was kind of fun. And these kinds of experiences absolutely do exist.
So in other words it really matters how we frame our analysis of phenomenology. And by making our
background assumptions explicit we not only increase the usefulness of the report but it becomes a lot
easier in the process of writing it because I don't have to clarify every time I want to make a statement
that the parameters of my word simulation have shifted or something like that.
And I'll also briefly mention QRI have developed a psychophysics tool for quantifying visual
psychedelic effects with various parameters such as trails, strobe, and replay in addition to
modifying effects such as persistence, intensity, and frequency. Yeah this is more psychophysics than
phenomenology but I think it's highly relevant because it allows you to analyze trends and reported
subjective effects for various states of consciousness providing some you know more kind of empirical
grounding for observations you know if we collected enough data within phenomenology.
And also this is a web app and it's free so if you're interested in trying it out
there is psychophysics.qri.org down there you can even access it on your phone
and if you wanted to contribute to research this is just like very preliminary at the moment
based on what people online you know they're just submitted parameters looking at the effects of
a just like a brief description. It's a web app that has just like a blue ball just bouncing around the box and if you look at it in
certain states of consciousness you can observe oh you know like maybe this has a trail or the strobes at
this particular frequency and then you kind of go back to it when sober and you try and replicate
the the effects based on your memory of what the the pattern looked like um and yeah we actually do
see like fairly consistent trends and the effects of some of these um you know these these submissions so
yeah you can check it out you can submit your own parameters if that's something you're interested in
um but yeah finally i will get to the exciting announcement which is uh so for the last two
years uh qri have organized two uh completely legal phenomenology research retreats um so yeah i think
it was maybe a year and a half or two years ago there was the brazil retreat and uh there it was studied
uh psilocybin and ayahuasca and then last year um uh this is the one that i i was fortunate enough to
attend uh got to go to canada where five meo dmt researchers or taking five meo dmt is completely
legal and um the aim of these retreats was basically to attract researchers with skills from various
quantitative domains such as physics maths signal processing visual artists experienced meditators
and psychonauts uh and then me the token philosopher um to live and and work together uh on the shared
mission of better modeling the phenomenal character of certain exotic states of consciousness so why did
we take this approach because obviously there are like many different ways in which you could conduct
research uh on altered states of consciousness um yeah to a first approximation there are three modes of
conducting research there are you could do third person studies you could be an individual explorer just go
really deep by yourself uh or you could take the think tank model and qri is essentially betting on
the think tank model being the most likely to yield high quality information about these states to actually
solve some of the open questions or problems uh and this is like broadly because so like we focus on
the third person studies um the methods that they employ are typically not not always but like uh typically in the
case of like detailed phenomenology too superficial to capture the nuances of something as as complex and
intrinsic to physical reality as phenomenal consciousness um so for example if you're a
researcher in the mid 19th century investigating the physical properties of magnetic fields you wouldn't
get research breakthroughs like maxwell's equations by taking random people off the street and uh and
letting them play around with a bunch of magnets uh and and then you know giving them a series of surveys it
just wouldn't happen you know you need people who are like very like technical or technically minded
and have relevant skills that are actually like allow them to solve the problem um and yeah to take a
real word example actually there was a recent study that investigated the subjective effects of combining
mdma with lsd aka candy flipping and uh it concludes quote mdma co-administration with lsd did not
change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with lsd alone end quote and then they
use the five dimensions of altered states of consciousness scale uh which you know i'm not
going to like you know ask any of you what you think of that but like i think it's like blatantly
you know not true um or at least it shows the limitations of the methods that are used in many of
these contexts with like you know kind of third person research like yeah obviously mdma co-administration
with with lsd has has uh you know novel effects that are kind of you know different than just
taking them individually but yeah this is just like a tangent um on the other hand so just like moving
on if we look at the individual explorer method of doing research you know pioneered by the likes of
john lilly kerence mckenna and others um i think it carries serious epistemic risks actually and by
epistemic risks uh this is like a two-fold risk i mean both there is a chance that you'll go crazy
in the sense of making bad inferences based on evidence and having like a model of reality that
is either like really overfitted or really underfitted this is something andres has written
about um in some of his blog posts on qualia computing um or and this is something i find more
interesting uh you'll probably find it difficult to meaningfully communicate your findings to others or
your experiences to others which kind of undermines the utility of such efforts for research purposes
um the reasons for this are like philosophically quite nuanced and i won't go into it although i can
talk about it later if anyone's interested um but like just in a single sentence um it's because
your internalized reference frames for conveying some semantic information have to be sufficiently
synchronized to common frames of reference in order for meaning to be transmitted or for meaning
to even exist in the first place um at least if you take uh bickenstein's private language argument
seriously which which i do um although this is like a personal comment i don't know about qri as a
whole but uh uh basically yeah you you need uh like common frames of semantic reference in order for
like you know to be able to like convey you know your experience with with any degree of fidelity at
the very least um and then yeah the think tank model works precisely because individual researchers
have the freedom to venture deep into exotic states of consciousness they can really kind of
you know get get deep into these states and look at them closely um but they remain embedded within
a linguistic community containing shared frames of semantic reference which kind of grounds them
in a sense it's like a safety net to you know like even if you have an experience that seems like
totally out of this world you know you can still kind of integrate it within like a kind of shared
understanding of like what you know the experiences and what it's doing and that that's really important
um also having everybody together in one place for an extended period um we hope to create a critical
mass of research activity that would lead to more substantial kind of research breakthroughs so you
could think of this as like this is quite trendy to use as a metaphor but like the manhattan project
of consciousness um and yeah while we're still processing the research outputs the the eta i have
been given is about a month from now so if you're interested in like staying updated because
yeah like we didn't we didn't just do these retreats and then just like talk about them and then just
like make a presentation we actually had like heaps of cool essays and like and and art like representing
what the five meo dmt state of consciousness is actually like um yeah it'll be ready in a month um
hopefully in early september so you can sign up to like the qri newsletter if you're interested
um yeah or just like stay up to date with the social media feed um but nonetheless i will share some
general information about uh what we got up to um and this is as i mentioned before this is the
third time uh this has been discussed because we uh we we wanted to save it and make it like a
a big announcement once everything was ready so first of all where did we go so we went to the
sentinel uh in british columbia canada which is a five meo dmt kind of a retreat center um they also do other
types of primarily like healing work like most psychedelic retreat centers are more focused on
healing um and yeah kind of conventional applications of altered states of consciousness
um they were kind of gracious enough to to let us in as like you know kind of like crazy i guess like
nerds who just want to be like really quantitative and analyze these states in a very different way
so we are like super thankful for them um for that uh as you can see in the photo it's like super
secluded um perfect for the type of research project that we were attempting um the retreat
center itself as i mentioned amazing staff they looked up after us throughout our stay so we had
like um kind of shared breakfasts and shared dinners and lunches and were able to like actually focus not
only on the research aspect but also the decompression as well um and it was situated right next to a
mountain lake so kind of great for you know early morning swims and the likes and with a variety of
different outdoor activities like including like hiking available in the area um which also helps
for decompression so we booked an extended stay um approximately two and a half weeks to give ourselves
really just like as much time as possible to study the state of consciousness um without having the
time pressure to go too deep too soon this is like especially relevant to note in the case of five
me odmt um and i should also just like put a you know kind of verbal disclaimer here uh like in
talking about it because yeah like during the q a i'm happy to answer questions if anyone has them
uh it is i wouldn't even consider it like a psychedelic it's a in my mind something completely different and
has to be treated very seriously so i would yeah like really strongly encourage if you're interested in
this state of consciousness um not just kind of like experimenting by yourself uh or kind of treating
it like something else um it's the kind of thing that like i think if we only had like three days i
don't think we would have made much progress or maybe it would have actually been like bad in some
respects of having to like really you know having that time pressure um so yeah that was good uh the
the days were mostly broken up into research days and working days but we also had a lot of flexibility
depending on on what came up in the process say you know if there was a research thread that i really
want to investigate and i was like okay i want a second consecutive day of like you know using the
the 5-meo vaporizer and just like studying this particular aspect you know we have the the freedom
and flexibility to to do that um this is the uh the malaka which is a ceremonial space um at the sentinel
and that's where most of the the research activities took place in addition to uh morning
meditations which is really good kind of grounding uh you know our experience and also just creating
kind of like a shared sense of like you know we're we're in this together trying to trying to understand
um consciousness um so yeah earlier in the retreat we tended to host larger group sessions while we were
still i guess familiarizing ourselves with 5-meo state of consciousness um holding space for each other
and really just like focusing on optimizing for well-being as i mentioned like 5-meo is like
extremely extremely powerful um it's not something to to dive right into um and so yeah we kind of had
that focus but then as time progressed we started to host yeah i guess like smaller more focused group
sessions with specific aims rather than having like everybody you know assembled together um but it is a
like beautiful space and it really like you can have you know up to like 20 people in there pretty
comfortably and uh also just the amazing views um yeah so here's a photo of uh some of the doses
we were working with this is 5-meo in freebase form um so we were vaporizing it using a heated loop of
stainless steel mesh uh kind of like roughly similar to the e-mesh method that's discussed in some online
communities for the nm dmt vaporization um and we had a dosing schedule that started very low at 1.5
milligrams and then gradually worked our way up in like small increments um but like actually one
important finding that like uh i i kind of stumbled across like very very early on because i think i'm
from memory i was the first person to to do it even at the low dose is that 5-meo is actually you have
an efficient vaporizer and the vaporizer that we were using is perfectly efficient um it's active
and like significantly lower doses than online uh kind of you know online resources would otherwise
recommend so if you kind of go on like psychonaut wiki and it would say you know low dose is like
maybe one to three milligrams and then high dose is like you know more than six or something like that
i honestly found that like half a milligram would be like enough to really like maybe i you know depending
on on the context and depending on on how how fast the come up was or how the trip progressed
um it could be like extremely powerful um and i would speculate that like most analog methods of
vaporizing 5-meo dmt so like using an open flame uh actually result in a lot of the material combusting
um and so and yeah combusted 5-meo to my knowledge is not psychoactive or at least it's like substantially
less than than if you get like the right vaporization setting so yeah like so little research has been
conducted on 5-meo but i think this is like really relevant to note but like you know if you have a
good vaporizer that is actually efficient and is actually not combusting it um yeah like online
resources are actually not that useful um and you should just start really low um and then yeah last of
all here's a photo of on today's and i after we we met in the the airport on the way to the retreat
center um this is i was living in london at the time and yeah flew over i didn't get much sleep on
the flight so i'm just like eating a plenty bar and somehow holding myself together but it was it was
exciting because it was actually the first time uh we met in person but i've like kind of been following
qri stuff since maybe 2019 and so this was like a yeah an awesome meeting um yeah so like some some
kind of key points uh i guess like summarizing some of it we learned just like really a lot about this
the state of consciousness uh but yeah i want to emphasize there's like so so much that we have yet
to discover it sounds kind of cliche but like really like there's there's so much here and even though
we have like a lot in the the output um that you'll soon see there's just yeah um i feel like
you know you need thousands of people working on this maybe um in order to like actually figure out
what's going on um but yeah uh still very excited to share um you know what we've discovered and like
the kind of the early um i guess methods that we took you know sharing what worked and what didn't
work for trying to kind of pioneer research of this of this type um as i mentioned before we all had
different skills that we brought to the table um so yeah as a philosopher the shape of my contribution
was an essay kind of analyzing 5meo's effects on valence and also its persisting afterglow which i
found like particularly interesting like um yeah my experience of 5meo itself was like seemingly less
interesting than like almost everyone else but i seem to have gotten like one of the biggest effects
in terms of just like really just changing how i perceive the world or or yeah just my
default mode of like sensory processing which i'd be happy to talk about um afterwards if anyone's
interested um but yeah we'd also uh like to note we want to host more phenomenology retreats in the
future um we think this is a neglected but like high leverage approach to modeling consciousness from
the inside out and yeah given this specific approach that we took focusing heavily on quantitative
analysis and psychophysics um it's also exciting because these retreats are like a world first like
this has literally never been done before so um yeah like really really cool to um to try and like
you know build traction and then try and like push this approach because yeah i think there's a lot to it
um on this note uh if if you or anyone you know has like technical skills that you think could be
relevant for this kind of research um we are welcoming i guess applications or you're just like welcome to send an
email to maybe like hunter on the qri website and you know provide like relevant information such as
your background um because yeah like as we were saying before like trying to get a critical mass of
people with like not not even just focusing on just like everybody has to be a mathematician or something
like that because because i have like very few quantitative skills but having someone else in that
environment actually allowed me to like make use of their skills and i got to like visualize a whole bunch of
like uh crazy like vector field effects on my perception of my my body map that i wouldn't have
been able to do otherwise so that's also in my in my in my essay um so just like having people who have
like technical skills but like across a wide variety of different areas relevant to this kind of this
kind of analysis um and also yeah just get in touch if you're interested in just helping to establish
this particular approach to to research and consciousness um in my mind at least you know it's it's not only
cool and exciting to be a part of it's also one of the few serious attempts at uh you know figuring
out what consciousness and valence actually are as i said at the beginning of the presentation and and
how they relate to to the rest of physical reality which is extremely ethically important so yeah i think
like there are actually strong ethical reasons to be like supporting this kind of research um we are
also open to if you know like somebody who has a bunch of money who wants to throw at this these
kinds of retreats we're open to to further funding as well so that would allow us to increase the
scope of the retreats and increase their frequency and also maybe even just like try and like i have
various other ideas for how to like you know encourage this kind of research approach um but as i
said before like it is really important actually that this is all done legally and um it requires like
flying to countries that have like you know retreat centers established and that have
um the infrastructure set up um in order to like enable us to just focus on research like i don't
think we would have been able to go to to the level of depth that we did if we just like rented you
know an apartment and makeover or something like that um so yeah uh definitely uh yeah i mean you can
find contact info on the qri website or you could even just like send me an email um afterwards i would
like to finish with uh what i think is for me at least one of the most uh inspiring uh kind of
passages that makes me want to kind of work on this and like dedicate you know more resources toward
it um and more effort it's uh this is david pierce uh he is a good friend of mine and he is also one of
the the founding reasons for qri's existence and also a lot of suffering reduction work uh both within
effective altruism but also just more broadly within like animal advocacy um which is yeah
as i mentioned something that i have a background in um so he has this like 2009 interview uh and i'll
just read a passage from the interview so he says i think it's hard to overstate the cognitive
significance of major psychedelics the future of sentience but it's also hard to convey why these
agents can be valuable tools for investigation for academics who have never tried them i know
distinguished drug naive philosophers of mind um and transhumanists who are certain that psychedelia
can't be significant and that and it would be irresponsible to urge them to put their assumptions
at the test perhaps the best i can do is to offer an analogy imagine an ultra intelligent tribe of
congenitally blind extraterrestrials their ignorance of vision and visual concepts is not explicitly
represented in their conceptual scheme uh to members of this hypothetical species visual experiences
wouldn't be information bearing any more than a chaotic drug-induced eruption of bat-like echoligatory
experiences would be information bearing to us such modes of experience have never been recruited by
evolution to play a sensory or signaling function at any rate sometime during the history of this imaginary
species one member of the tribe discovers a drug that alters his neurochemistry the drug doesn't just
distort his normal senses and sense of self it triggers what we would call visual experiences
vivid chaotic in texture and weirder than anything the drug taker had ever imagined what can this drug
intoxicated subject do to communicate his disturbing new categories of experience to his tribe's scientific
elite if he simply says his experiences are ineffable then the skeptics will scorn such mysticism and
obscuritism uh obscure obscurantism if he speaks metaphorically and expresses himself using words from
the conceptual scheme grounded in the dominant sensory modality of his species then he'll probably babble
delirious nonsense maybe he'll start talking about messages from the gods or whatever critically this drug
user lacks the necessary primitive terms to communicate his experiences let alone a theoretical understanding of
what's happening understandably the knowledge elite are unimpressed by the drug disturbed users claims
of making a profound discovery they can exhaustively model the behavior of the stuff of the physical
world with the equations of their scientific theories and their formal models of mind are computationally
adequate the drug taker sounds psychotic yet from our perspective we can see that the alien psychonaut
has indeed stumbled upon a profound discovery even though he has scarcely glimpsed its implications
the raw materials of what we would call the visual world in all its glory and uh i will end with
that so thank you all for coming these are two of my websites and in the qri earl but um does anyone
have any any questions uh after all of that yeah just very very nice talk thank you um i just had a question
on what kinds of methods are you using to bring together all these different reports of the psychedelic
experiences like what what methods we're using in our our own analysis like yeah conducting the retreat so
yeah initially it was a bit more structured as i mentioned we kind of had like a larger group
um kind of you know holding space for everyone um and kind of like just getting familiar with like
very low doses of it and it was kind of just like tipping you know dipping your toes in the water uh
testing the water type uh type stuff but um it really actually like there's no unifying method
there is like a unifying kind of like uh agreement that like you know we should be studying uh or modeling
these states uh with a lot more detail than has previously been done but um but the exact method
will probably depend a lot on um you know the relevant skills of the researcher so under days for
example he's really big into psychophysics he's got some like really cool um stuff to show from the
brazil retreat and also the canada retreat of uh like patterns uh and gestalts that you can see within
patterns that you can only see in certain states of consciousness and you can actually just look at it
sober and then you can look at it in that state and and you have a different visual experience um so
there's that kind of thing but this is also like outside of like my scope like i'm probably a bit
more interested in the kind of philosophical you know how do i kind of use uh like semantic concepts
to latch on to the phenomenal character and how can i how can i model valence in a way that's productive
um in order to you know solve various ethical problems that i'm concerned with uh and so for me it
was like much more just like dive head first um have as many possible different experiences of different
varieties and then the interesting ones like maybe like less than 10 percent of my experience i i had
actually like over 100 experiences with five meo at the retreat based on a firm estimate that i did
uh afterwards so like you know it might have been more or less um yeah like like most most of my
experiences were actually just kind of like okay like i just need to know how how to be in the state
like what kind of mental moves do i do um you know in certain states you you kind of want to like
focus on on maybe certain aspects to you know to investigate the the quality of certain certain
sensory modalities or sensations through those modalities with five meo i found that like i was
unable to to contract my my awareness to to like attend to any part of my experience uh at higher doses
without it being very painful so i actually had to learn to not pay attention to anything in the state
which is just like totally counterintuitive but yeah my hypothesis is basically five meo kind of wants
to be like as unified uh or like you know it wants complete symmetry and and what attention does within
the field of experiences kind of breaks those symmetries um so yeah that that was my method i'm not sure
if that answered your question but yeah lots of different types uh any other questions yeah
yeah so i really like your slide about the uh different philosophical approaches and how that might
impact your uh reports of your experience i think that's true and i think it's it's been a long-standing
problem in the uh phenomenological approaches to consciousness people just sort of you know report
things that seem to embed their own theoretical assumptions and then that that leads it seems to
be not objective and you can kind of take that worry further in the direction of eliminative materialism
where you think actually just our best whatever our best scientific theory is eventually going to tell
us that's what consciousness is like um but i wonder whether actually the qri approach that you've been
talking about um does that partly aggress that response but with the idea of focusing on these
structural features are those structural features actually uh you could argue invariant under those
changes of the background theory so you know descriptions of these symmetrical patterns geometrical
description seems like that's how you would describe them even if you came up with a completely different
theory of consciousness and that might be an advantage of this qri approach yes yeah absolutely yeah
that's a really good point and yeah maybe i as i said i'm kind of biased and making or emphasizing that
point about philosophical background assumptions because i am a philosopher and that's just what
i'm interested in um in my case because you know my output was was almost entirely you know kind of
word-based and i was writing essays i think that's a lot more relevant in the context of like yeah kind of
creating like writing an essay or writing like a theoretical analysis of a state of consciousness but like
say if you're a mathematician and yeah you're analyzing like the the symmetry groups that appear within
like tessellations within you know within your experience on on a certain like maybe not 5.0 but
maybe like nn or lsd or something like that then you're right that's kind of like invariant uh like
regardless of if you're a direct realist or an indirect realist you know if you have the the right
conceptual tools in order to do this kind of like phenomenological analysis then it doesn't actually
matter you know like what what your background assumptions are um and so yeah this is like certainly
like a strong argument in favor of uh actually trying to you know to the best of our uh to i
guess like to the best of our capacity try and provide descriptions that are somewhat ontologically
agnostic so you don't have to assume i am an unlimited a limit of this materialist you don't have to
assume i'm you know a non-materialist physicalist uh or i'm an idealist or whatever uh in order to
to actually do do a lot of like meaningful research uh although depending on the shape of your your essay
that could help yeah yeah um uh you've talked about uh the distinction between um uh structure and
content right though i think this is structure and representation yeah um it's something i think a lot
about about and i i wonder whether the two are entirely distinct or whether there's a gray area
in between and i wonder if you know yes yeah so the question was uh like regarding uh kind of structure
and content or like the the phenomenal content or the representational content in the slide that i
that i had earlier um and if it's like as clear-cut of a distinction right is there like is there a space in
between um i definitely think so i think this is like kind of it's a useful framing of of like a
problem in a lot of trip reports that i see where it's just like i mean you know like standing here
right now like i have to actually assume a bunch of axioms that get that allow me to like you know
assume that i'm conveying meaning to all of you um and you know i'm speaking at the semantic level just
because i'm using words right um so like it's definitely like you know it's not it's not a matter of
just like entirely doing one or the other um i did have like a there is a part of my essay um
where i am kind of like probing at this kind of the space in between where um i'm talking about the
the afterglow of my experience and um something i personally uh had as a result of uh yeah like
doing all the five meo was my my instinct up until i guess the retreat was you know i would have an
experience and there'd be a sort of like implicit kind of like uh labeling or categorizing or kind
of creating dualities within like different different percepts or the phenomena you know like
like chair person you know room space you know non-space you know that's like filled up with
something um and and then maybe like with sounds you know sometimes you you kind of like associate
certain like emotions or certain concepts with certain like vocalizations or patterns and sound
um that that kind of implicit labeling or conceptualization really significantly reduced
so i found that like rather than like like not even in the conscious sense of like thinking abstractly
and thinking there is the chair there there is you know like this and that in my experience it was
almost like like i could kind of like lock onto that way of looking but that wasn't the default state
anymore and i think there's kind of there's actually something to this and like it may be a
pretty theoretical sense of just like just really sensing differences between different different
phenomena or different like you know kind of qualia values within our experience um like yeah um
anyway yeah that's addressed in my essay but certainly worth considering you know um
let's take one more question and uh yeah um yeah sorry this is a little incoherent um i i guess kind of
relate to the last question i just wonder if you think there are any limits to this kind of like
data-driven structural analysis kind of approach because when you were talking i was kind of
drawing analogy in my mind with like art and making art you know which also deals with qualia
with like uh phenomenon with like subjective experience and it's like so for example you know
the scene before all of our eyes at the moment it's so infinitely complex that kind of approach
uh structural kind of approach to try and describe everything that we're seeing even though you know
it's not particularly remarkable or even a representational approach where again you try and
sum this up in a very literal way um it seems like this very history to tell you that neither of those
approaches are actually effective instead it's a metaphorical use of language that would allow you
you know like a skilled writer could you know in in a few phrases a few brush strokes like give you
something that actually evokes what we're all seeing now much more effectively than either a
structural or a representational approach so i guess yeah for me there seems to be like a really
strong relation between creation of art and the kind of work you're trying to do i just wonder like
with this uh approach of like you know collecting masses of data it would kind of be contrary to what
you see in art where it is like you know you're able to sum these things up where a metaphorical use of
language can actually capture something like a large data set yeah yeah this is this is actually
something that i was recently in um in tucson uh arizona for the science of consciousness conference
and i got to meet one of my my intellectual heroes shamil tandaria and have a conversation with him
and i was kind of like actually addressing this kind of thing like i i have even though like i'm a you
consider myself a pioneer of this particular approach to doing research i still hold that
like it's impossible to perfectly capture you know the what of this likeness or the the the kind of
texture or the quality of the experience i think there are like more or less skillful ways of pointing
toward the thing that we're trying to that we're trying to capture um or trying to express it you know
using like um frames that are kind of like publicly accessible um but yeah i i see this as like maybe like
a problem at the level of like phenomenology is itself it's not individually sufficient to solve
the problem uh i i think it's like maybe jointly sufficient with like more kind of third person
research and maybe like um yeah like i i think you kind of you need a collection of different approaches
but shamil's uh kind of comment to me was basically what you just said he was like all you can do is
really just use poetry to to express and uh yeah i think there's actually like there is something to that
like when it when i you know in my essay um hopefully this this comes across but like i am
like very analytical but i am also trying to use language beautifully because this is like yeah i
think there's there's really something um yeah to this point and and qri also more broadly i should
note has like emphasized um you know actually uh involving like artists and and making like the project of
phenomenology also a project and and you know art both like visual uh and also like you know through
different sensory modalities like music is a you know an example of of art that is non-visual but uh
yeah i think can clearly like capture certain emotions or or textures of experience so yeah
um and i will also uh there'll be a i guess extended q a maybe as part of the young conference and so
yeah just like if you have any more specific questions come up and talk to me there but uh
thank you all for coming
