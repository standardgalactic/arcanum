they can track exactly what's happening and when a girl deletes multiple selfies
that's the moment they hit her with an advertisement for beauty products
because they figured if they're deleting multiple selfies they must be not satisfied with how they
look so let's give them beauty products 10 year old girls are going to sephora to buy
skincare products it's insane it's because they're on instagram
we've all got that person in our family who comes to family gatherings dinners goes to parties
but they're not really there they're on their phone they're zoned out fundamentally they're elsewhere
what happens to society when so many young people behave like that when they're never really present
in the moment what does it mean for them and what does it mean for our culture more broadly
today's guest has extraordinarily strong views about precisely that he's probably the most
influential social scientist in the world right now he thinks that social media mobile phones
constant access to the internet is fundamentally rewiring childhood and remaking what it is to be
human in the 21st century i am so looking forward to this conversation he is influencing people right
across the political divide and it's a conversation that has to be had jonathan hate welcome to
downstream thank you aaron what a pleasure to be here it's a pleasure to have you i must say first
impressions you seem a remarkably serene calm man anything but anxious you always just always this
calm or is this relaxed well uh yeah i my personality has always been kind of calm i don't get angry
easily um i sometimes do get anxious especially at times when i've been spending more time on social
media but no in general i'm a fairly calm person that's good to know so we're talking about this
book the anxious generation and uh you're a very very very powerful authority and i have to say
i think this might be one of the most important books so far in the 2020s
um i read it when it came out in hardback about a year ago just reread it
uh i probably read it a third time a fourth time as a new parent it's invaluable how old are your
kids my daughter is 17 months old and it's something oh thank you very much it's something
i really want to talk about later on actually is how uh quickly should they be exposed to tv screens
let's start right at the top really big question okay what is childhood and why is it so important
for humans yeah so um humans have unusually large brains uh and what happens among mammals
is it's especially social mammals have larger brains and um those brains take a long time to
wire up our our secret power we don't have sharp teeth or any other weapons our secret power is
culture we have the ability to innovate and then learn and we we are the beneficiaries of literally
millions of generations of human innovation and so childhood is a way to wire up the brain now that's
kind of dry and technical it sounds a little better once i say the main way that we do that
is through play um all mammals play play is a biological imperative play is a product of evolution
so we play play play play and um if you play if you have the right kind of play experiences and it
obviously it differs at different ages you know the first couple years you're probably fighting with
your daughter she's learning to use her hands and she puts things in her mouth and she's exploring
things not sending signals to her brain to wire up all the physical stuff next she's probably just
starting on language and this is gonna your world is just gonna light up when you can communicate
with her it it just it just gets all sparkly and and that's a whole nother set and so childhood is
this long uh this long process by which the brain wires up and of course if technology hijacks it so
you don't have those experiences you have different experiences the outcomes are not good and that's
what the book is about and how has childhood changed in the last 15 years so uh childhood certainly
changes across the centuries i don't i don't want to make it sound like oh there's a human childhood
and then recently everything changed but um even though the surrounding world changes a lot uh kids
were in the western world at least for the last since the you know early industrial revolution i don't
know what happened you know early part but kids are basically they're out in the street and if you've
traveled around the world wherever you go you see well it's often just boys but kids are outside
playing running around having adventures and a weird thing happened in the english-speaking
countries in the 1990s if it was just america then we could say oh americans freaked out about
child abduction because america has a lot of crime and we're a weird country and giant country and you
know crazy stuff comes out of america so if it's just america we'd say well it was response to the
crime wave i grew up during a huge crime wave in the 70s and 80s but we all played outside in the 90s
crime plummets but yet that's the decade when we lock up our kids and we say we no longer let them
out when they're seven or eight which is what it always was uh we now keep them in until they're 10
or 11. and even then we supervise them a lot more so if it was just america it would just be a weird
thing but the weirdest thing is that the same thing happened in canada and the uk not so much in
australia new zealand they're a few years behind us but it's happening there now didn't happen in
northern europe in northern europe they still let their kids out um but that is in a sense you could
say the book is a tragedy in two acts act one is the loss of the play-based childhood which happened
all across the anglosphere in the 1990s and into the 2000s um but the kids didn't get depressed then
it's not until the second phase 2010 to 2015 that's what i call the great rewiring of childhood that's when
everything really turns south so that's really interesting because a lot of the case that you
draw upon in the book are the anglophone countries uk us canada australia etc but it feels like the
conclusions are generalizable ones they are what places do you see which kind of deviate from some
of the conclusions we're going to talk about what countries have mass adoption of social media by young
people and yet we don't see any of these big downsides okay so in this first part of the
conversation we're just going to talk about mental illness as the outcome variable and which is
especially depression and anxiety it's what's called internalizing disorders so if we just keep
our focus on that we'll see some variation later i hope we'll get to what i think is actually the
bigger thing which is the destruction of the human ability to pay attention and that seems to be
universal okay but suppose suppose we're back where i was when i started the book i thought this was
going to be a book about social media making girls depressed and anxious because that's where the
evidence was clearest it wasn't so clear for boys it wasn't so easy to show that boys spend a lot of
time on social media they're a little more depressed that's true but it's not the big effect that you
get for girls um so um so if we just look at mental at the sudden plummeting of mental health the huge
sudden increases in anxiety depression and self-harm which is related to anxiety then what we see is a
very sharp elbow around 2012 2013 in the us uh uh and then in all the anglophone countries it's roughly
the same australia new zealand is a year or two later um but here's the interesting thing we see
very much the same pattern in northern europe um the one place we don't see it in terms of you know most
of the world we don't have data for we don't have long-running studies with good data from latin america
or from uh most of asia or africa but the countries that have tracked mental health for decades
we um there is a survey in that includes eastern europe i guess this goes back to the 90s there's
a survey in eastern europe that does not seem to show kids getting more depressed so that's the
exception is eastern europe and um and then the other thing i can tell you which is related is we're
able to go deep in the united states because we have the multiple large studies we can cut it by
gender and religiosity and all sorts of demographic variables what we find is that the curves are very
very sharp they're sharper for girls than boys they're sharper and and much bigger for kids for
high school students who say that their families are religious i'm sorry the sharper for sorry they're
sharper for families that uh where they say they are not religious if it's a religious family they don't
go up as much and interestingly it's sharpest for those who say that they are liberal and it's weaker
for those who say they're conservative and so the way we put this together and this is speculation but
this seems to make sense of these different patterns i just told you about is that children need to be
anchored rooted in a moral community with a constant sense of right and wrong and constraints
that they learn to live within and i'm a huge fan my favorite thinker of all time is the sociologist
emil durkheim who wrote about the need for constraint in his book suicide and he wrote about he gave us
the concept of anomie or normlessness and so if you look at all this together um the religious kids
the conservative kids uh they are much more rooted anchored constrained whereas if you're a secular
liberal like the way i grew up you know you have lots of freedom your parents aren't going to put a
lot of rules on you everything is open to question and so before 2012 um conservatives were a little
happier than liberals and religious people are a little happier than non-religious people that's been
true for a long time but at 2012 2013 that gap gets enormous because it's really the secular
liberal kids especially who get washed out to see and are deep in meaninglessness and enemy as all
they do is just consume social media content so this is really interesting so obviously durkheim's
writing what late 19th century 20th yeah yeah um and obviously there were huge debates at that
time around degeneration decline of the west etc it sounds kind of familiar today with spengler and
max nordow and whatnot um but the point you made there about anime and normlessness obviously not
new but the data you draw upon in the book is fascinating for one thing which is that teenagers
and young adults actually see incidents of anxiety falling in the early 2000s ever so slightly that's
right that's right before it rockets up again and i i'm looking at that data it's quite funny for me
because i was you know i was 20 25 or something around then and so i'm thinking this was probably
the the best time in the last 50 years to to be entering adulthood so we have anime we have
normlessness at the turn of the 21st century and yet it shifts up so the the sort of critique you've
got i think you can tell me if i'm wrong is secular capitalist civilization plus smartphones create
something really unique and quite destructive fundamentally but perhaps you're underweighting
the secular capitalist civilization bit and you're overweighting the mobile phone bit i mean that's
the criticism you tend to yeah find no this is great i'm so i'm a political centrist i i was
always on the left when i was growing up i was sort of a bill clinton democrat um and once
i wrote the righteous mind i became a centrist and not just because i think the answer is in the
middle but because i feel like you have to listen to the critiques from both sides in order to
understand anything and so i really appreciate what you just said because you know here i teach
in a business school i have a i have a generally positive view of capitalism but i'm very aware of
the extraordinary destructiveness it can make and if we'd had this talk a few years ago or four or five
years ago you know i probably would have been more on the like pro-capitalism with all kinds of
constraints and problems but as i hope will come out in in the rest of this conversation i feel like we
are looking at something so gigantic something so almost impossible to conceive of what might be
happening to young people around the world um that if it is if it is the business model of these three
or four giant companies that is wrecking childhood then that really does change that really does change
what i would think and say about the role of capitalism um in the 21st century uh we have
to figure this out but right now it's looking it's looking pretty frightening
i often think actually that these big firms you talk about meta alphabet etc um what they're doing to
concentration kind of undermines the rest of the capacity um of the economy to generate returns and
generate revenue and i think there's probably a pro-capitalist argument to be curbing the influence
and the reach and the expanse of these of these businesses you said that you've changed your mind
in the last three or four years maybe what triggered that well so okay so um uh as i said when when we first
met um knowing that i was going to be talking to you and and talking about capitalism which i haven't
talked about in a while but yet i got a contract to write a book on it in 2014 and i you know i moved
to nyu stern from the university of virginia i was really fascinated i didn't know anything about
capitalism because i was a very well-educated american so you never learn anything about capitalism
or economics not much about economics um and so um so i got so i was observing how we have this
the culture war that i wrote about in the righteous mind the same culture war was sort of applying to
the economic domain left and right had different views of austerity versus stimulus uh uh different
views of on regulation different beliefs about economics um so so i spent a couple years really
learning about capitalism and and you know as a centrist i'm going to listen to both sides and
understand the strengths and the weaknesses um and there's there's one key quote that i got from a
speaker philosopher who spoke at nyu in my first year or two david schmitz was his name and
he said something like um a good free market society is one in which you can only get rich by
making other people better off and i think that's the central insight that's the invisible hand that's
all sorts of things and that really has stuck with me uh because to the extent to the extent that you
have a system where that's true then i think business is it generates most of the of the the the
surplus value the comfort the wealth uh and and societies that don't have free markets tend not
to be very nice places to live so when uh when you can only get rich by making other people better
off you have the foundation of a very good society a lot more work needs to be done but that's going to
be the the engine that drives prosperity but then the question is to what extent is it easy in any
given country to get rich while making other people worse off and with technology early on we thought
these were gifts from the gods and they unquestionably created massive amounts of value and our lives are
better off in so many ways and you know i i love technology and the tech industry is mostly companies
that are making our lives better but what i'm beginning to see is that the the net benefit or surplus
conveyed on society by especially instagram by meta i should say by meta snapchat and tick tock those
are the three big ones that are harming kids um those companies i think are making huge amounts of money
while they are making some people better off but in terms of kids they are causing harm at such a level
that it swamps everything else and the key thing to keep your mind your eye on here is what is their
business model a normal business model is you have a you have a good or a service and you sell it to
people who want it and if they don't think it's good for them they won't buy it now they're addictive
substances that's a different that's a different area of markets and exploitation but the weird business
model operating here which is i think what's wrecking the world in a way is the advertising based
business model where what you're trying to do is maximize engagement and that's what the problems
mostly flow from so it's uh you know it's not it's not every tech company at all there are some tech
companies that aren't hurting kids at all um but meta snap and tick tock seem to have mastered the art
of taking all of children's attention half of our kids in the united states i think it's the same brin
half of our kids say they're online almost constantly almost all the time they always have the phone in
their hand if they if they're talking to you they're thinking about what's going on in the phone
so these three companies plus a few others and video game companies i should say have basically
extracted almost all human attention now what is the value of that it's not just the trillions
that these companies are worth it's the future ability of humanity to focus do anything control
your own lives so i'm still trying to wrap my head around this and i could be wrong but what i'm
beginning to see is is that this the mental health crisis is only the tip of the iceberg that what's
happening to human attention i think is much bigger than the than the destruction of mental health
yeah so just to synthesize everything you said there because i think this is a really important
point we tend to lump in the technology companies together what you're saying is okay amazon may have
a ton of negative externalities for mom and pop shops but there's a net benefit to society in your view
probably alphabet too but with the these particular firms tick tock and um meta instagram right you think
those are net negative for society quite significantly yes that's right i do very much so and there's
two reasons to say it the first is when we look okay so obviously google and apple are the other
gigantic ones and there's netflix and there are a few others in the in the giant um we don't see people
coming out of google saying okay i've got all these secret recordings from google look look at the
terrible things they're doing now obviously you know they play hardball and when they need to is but
but i i don't get google started with an ethical culture long ago um and i think you can still see
it google i don't see signs that it's a predatory company again i can't vouch for all their business
practices but you know google makes my life better makes your life better um so i don't think google and
apple are you know are to blame in the same way they're obviously part of the ecosystem but but meta in
particular is the one where we have repeated whistleblowers coming out saying we have evidence of
vast harms to children here's what we could do to abet them here are the things we could do arturo
behar brought out uh the extraordinary rates by which children teenagers are sexually harassed or
at least approached by strangers on instagram as he put it this is the largest scale sexual harassment
to have ever happened um and he came to leadership with a solution here if we just make it easy for
people to report then when we get multiple reports we can find the people who do this
and over and over again they don't do it so i think and um uh my my group we uh uh at anxious
generation we have a a sub stack called after babble we've put out major documents on tick tock and
snapchat just quoting their own employees what the lawyers you know because there are thousands of
dead kids and their parents are suing these companies and there are 50 attorneys general they're
almost all suing these companies so what i'm saying is those three companies seem to be predatory
they are the ones that get all the lawsuits from parents they are the ones that the kids point to
as breaking their attention and interestingly um they are the ones where it appears if you ask the
question the right way you you get a huge net negative value let me just explain that one thing
economists do is they ask like you know suppose suppose you could never have uh tea again how much
would we have to pay you to never have tea okay and then you you know you would say uh you know a
thousand dollars a thousand pounds and we add that all up we owe the net value of tea is you know
x trillion dollars to society um so that's a common way of doing things and if you do that uh so this
economist uh leonardo burstin at the university of chicago he and his colleagues they did this
uh i think students at chicago um and they said how much would we have to pay you if you know do
you use instagram do you use tick tock they use those two how much we have to pay you to go off for
a month and and there was some amount of money that they paid let's say it was fifty dollars on
average so you know they would they would have to be paid to go off but then they said okay now
we're trying to do an experiment we're going to try to get almost everybody to go off for a month
how much would we have to pay you to go off if everybody else goes off and the answer is
negative 50 or something i don't know the exact number but the point is oh oh you everyone i would
pay you i would love to get off of tick tock my students feel trapped by it they know it wastes
their time they know it's stupid they know it it it's degrading in a lot of ways but they say they
have to stay on because otherwise they won't know the memes they won't know what people are talking about
they have to stay in the loop so these three companies have created a trap and therefore the
net value to society is negative and possibly trillions of dollars worth of negative it's
really interesting you say that because when elon musk was buying then twitter now x i was thinking
about the kinds of functionality i'd be willing to pay for one of them was to limit my tweets
interesting interesting i would pay i would absolutely pay for a premium service where i could only
tweet five times a day because sometimes it becomes compulsive and you're you're writing so
many tweets because you might be replying to other people the economy of the tweets is just you know
it's it's crazy right so that's really really um interesting you mentioned instagram meta as
being maybe the the primary antagonist here have you spoken about this stuff personally to mark
zuckerberg obviously you're a very prominent individual in this space now yeah no i have but first
i just want to build on your idea you're that was such a cool idea let me do you one better
suppose there was a competitor to x and part of their whole thing was you can only post five a
day everybody can only post five a day that's going to mean the quality is much higher oh and suppose
they said oh and we do identity authentication you don't have to post with your real name nobody's
going to know who you are but just prove to us that you were a real person in in a real country
this wouldn't be a law mandating it but suppose there was a competitor that had these constraints that
was only real people and these real people um had a limit on how much they could post and now imagine
the ecosystem that would emerge there like wow i would love to be on that yeah okay now back to to
meta um so i think i mentioned at least one or one or maybe both of my two encounters with mark
zuckerberg in the anxious generation uh in august of 2019 mark zuckerberg's office reached out to me and
asked if they could arrange a talk between me and mark a video a video call and this was a time when
zuckerberg was like traveling around the us and talking to all kinds of people so i was very
pleased i was flattered by that and you know i think he knew i was a critic of social media's role
back then it was social media and democracy in 2019 i was just beginning to get the evidence
on mental health i wasn't as confident at first um so i said okay great let's you know let's talk and so we
had a zoom you know or a you know whatever their platform was uh for 30 or 40 minutes i think uh and
we talked about the what it's doing to democracy and when we had a bit of a debate it was friendly
he knows a lot of the academic research and then then i raised the topic of of kids of teen mental
health because i'd written the coddling american mind we speculated there that the timing is right
but we don't have evidence but by august of 2019 i was collecting the evidence with gene twangy
that actually it's not just correlations there are experiments there's testimony there's all sorts
of things this is looking like this is hurting a lot of kids so i told him about that and again we
had a kind of a you know friendly debate you know there are a couple of academic articles that he
often cites uh uh andrew shibilsky is a researcher here at at oxford um so you know he cited work by
shibilsky i cited you know other work and and we sort of went around like that it was very friendly
and we had a follow-up email correspondence um uh and then um and then i was invited to uh his
house for dinner because his wife had read the read the calling american mind and had liked it and so
i was very pleased his office invited me um to their house for dinner it was really nice dinner and they
were friendly um but we sort of continued like mark and i continued the same sort of thing it was like
you know an engaged you know an engaged disagreement between knowledgeable people so that was all that
was all great that was all very interesting but i did tell him i said look there is emerging evidence
there was growing evidence certainly of the correlation uh there's a lot of evidence that
girls who use are heavy users of social media and especially instagram there are a few studies that show
it's especially instagram um that girls are particularly at risk for increased depression anxiety self-harm
eating disorders things like that um so you know the academics are debating it uh but i i laid out
what i thought was the evidence at the time did he seem like a good person to you because you talk
in the book about the need for a sort of moral framework and so on and lots of these companies
overtly haven't really been put with that in mind yeah how did he come across to you as an individual
well you know as an individual he you know he was friendly and and so i can't you know i don't want
to comment on his personal demeanor he it was you know it was a very nice evening so i'm grateful for
that um i mean sorry let me rephrase sorry to interrupt i don't mean a good person did he seem
like a moral person with a strong firm sense of right and wrong well there so i'm not going to
comment based on my two interactions because there wasn't much to go on there like it really was like
you know both of us i think are very much like you know high systemizers heads in the data so i mean
that's you know that was that was enjoyable but that um but what i'm where i would be critical is based on
so many things i've read um based on you know from uh you know there's like talking back to facebook
long ago there are oh there's a book the ugly truth there's the whistle what the whistleblowers
brought out and now the new book uh careless people all of these paint a similar portrait um
which seems to be of a man who is so focused on the success of his company i do not think he's
motivated by money i didn't get i don't ever get that sense i but i think he's a very competitive man
who who loves his company it's his baby he has you know the corporate structure or the stock
owning structure is unusual that he has almost complete control over what happens so i think
he's very focused on the victory or the success of of his companies of his company and its subsidiaries
and based on what the whistleblowers say and what the books say it seems as though whenever people
have brought him evidence of harm and told him here's how he could fix it if there would be a cost
to engagement he says no and i don't know that it's always him they talk about bringing up to
leadership so there may be you know i don't know what role others played but that is what i mostly
fault him for that he's known for a long time that at least there is evidence even if he's not sure
it's conclusive there is evidence that it is harming children i've been saying at an industrial scale
we're not talking about a few victims we're talking about possibly millions and millions and easy
fixes have been proposed and he hasn't done them so i think he is morally responsible for that
what are those easy fixes that have been proposed yeah so uh so the the uh the clearest one
so there are two main whistleblowers there's francis haugen who had all kinds of suggestions
now hers were more about democracy um like uh toning down the super virality things like uh you know
limit like limit the number of of invitations one can send out to groups but limit it so that you
have to be you're in what would be like the bottom 98 because most of the garbage is sent out by the
one percent that are sending out you know thousands and thousands so she had all kinds of design change
and this is very important all most of us who are in this world of trying to get reform on social media
we're not focused on content moderation we are not saying oh you know they should clamp down on this
or that we're focused on design as malcolm as um marshall mcleughan said um the medium is the message
don't focus on the content focus on the design so francis haugen brought out all kinds of design
changes that could have made it much less toxic to democracy and they did one of them in i think 2016
they did one where they turned they've you know there's something they can turn down or up essentially
you know as though it was a lever um i can't remember whether it has to do with the virality or
whatever but it it means that either more extreme content gets more grip or less grip so they can
control it but they don't um so that so she had a lot of ideas especially on democracy she also brought
out a lot of stuff about their own studies about how it's harming girls mental health but the specific
one where uh the specific one where they could act on it they could solve a problem very quickly
um is making it easy to report um when especially for minors making it easy to report um behavior
that does not reach the threshold of harassment but is creepy and so especially instagram and snapchat are
the main ways that men around the world reach children um sextortion begins usually on those two
platforms um it's it's insane that we you know any nine-year-old can lie about her age and suddenly be
talking to a 40 year old sex criminal around the world um they could easily put a stop to that not
with content moderation but by giving uh giving everyone an easy button to say something about this
feels off that wouldn't be a reason to kick the person off the platform but if there are a thousand
of those reports boom they're gone so they could do things like that and arturo behar his point was they
weren't and so he actually put it all in a message that he sent by email to all the leadership as i
understand it so they couldn't deny that they got it so they all got this message and i believe to
date they still have not done what he called for back in 2017 18 something like that why is instagram
in particular seemingly and social media generally again you put on a ton of data here why is it so
much more damaging when we look at a bunch of metrics um hospitalizations self-reported feelings of
depression anxiety etc why is it so much worse for young girls than young boys yeah yeah so we'll
do the boys in a moment because what i didn't realize i i thought that this whole thing was
worse for girls than boys and if we just look at mental health at age 14 it is uh and so we'll get
to the boys in a minute because there the story is addiction but for the girls one way to think about
it is um if you were a business that was your goal was to trap girls and suck out all of their attention
if your business is dependent on just grabbing them and keeping them you know you know strapped down to a
to a gurney and you know with their eyes open and sucking out their their attention um if that was
your goal what would you how would you trap them what would you use as bait and the definition of a
trap is is a is a mechanism by which when the the animals attracted there's bait there's the animals
attracted to something and then once they grab it they can't get out that's what a trap is and so for
girls the trap is social information um girls and boys differ on average in terms of what interests
them differences in ability are not that large differences of interest are very large and very
consistent girls have a more elaborate mental map they're more interested in who's in who's out who's
who knows who's secrets who's dating whom who's fighting with whom whereas the male brain is
literally shifted over a little bit towards autism this is the work of simon barron cohen just higher
systemizing lower empathizing so so when instagram says uh you know they ping you do you want to
know what so and so said about so and so or what so and so said about you or what did they said they
tagged you in a photo so this is irresistible to to girls to teenage girls and so it uses that as a
that's the bait now they go in voluntarily you might say but once most of them are in then no one
can leave because if you leave you're cut off they're all communicating by direct message on on
instagram so that's why it's it's a trap it's a sink it's more addictive to girls um than to boys
and then what it does is it it ends up again not well i was going to say not by design but actually
it appears to be by design i have some quotes in the book um they understand girls insecurities they
understand the way that emotion gets ahead of the frontal cortex the self-control um and they
understand insecurities and so if you are comparing if you are making girls compare themselves
you know girls have always compared themselves to other girls but if it was just five or ten in
your town or 50 it's different than if it's thousands who are almost all more beautiful than
you because of careful editing and filters and all of that and in fact one of the most horrible
and just tip i suppose typical um things brought out by sarah wynne williams the recent book careless
people is that they can track exactly what's happening and when a girl deletes multiple selfies
that's the moment they hit her with an advertisement for beauty products because they figured and this
has to i don't i assume it was done consciously it must have been done consciously i don't know if ai
could have figured this out but somebody figured out if they're deleting multiple selfies they must be
not satisfied with how they look so let's give them beauty products and so again just playing on
girls insecurities and making them feel they have to spend their lives making themselves more beautiful
spend their money on more makeup products 10 year old girls are going to sephora to buy skin care
products it's insane it's because they're on instagram so in so many ways instagram in particular
is causing harm to girls oh and then there's i mean there's more sexual predation of girls than there is
of boys um um there's the perfectionism girls are more subject to perfectionism and instagram really
sort of encouraged you to be you know a perfect perfect selfie so each platform has a different
profile of harms instagram is the main one to focus on for girls mental health outcomes
snap and tick tock have different profiles of harms i mean that sounds like abuse if somebody was to
respond to a young woman doing that by then saying well actually maybe you want this you know that's
the the problem for me to say maybe you would like to be more beautiful we would say that's a nasty
thing to say certainly a bit of an actually but it's also borderline abusive well i would um i i would
say that if you are hosting children if you have taken over the social lives of children if you have
deliberately made yourself the place that young people that children are hanging out i would say that
you have a responsibility you have a duty of care and that's one of the great things that happened in
the uk was you have the age appropriate design code the first in the world that i know of to assert
that these platforms have a duty of care that is different you can exploit adults much more you know
adults we think oh you know caveat emptor adults can make up their own minds you can use sharp
practices on adults that are unethical but they're not illegal but children are a different story we all
agree about that left right and libertarian children are different and these platforms don't act that
way children are profit center just as with the tobacco companies they need to get them young because
if they don't get them young another their competitors will get them young and they'll keep them
so abuse isn't exactly the right word uh i think exploitation callousness um um and just a general lack
of of of a moral compass at these three companies i mean this gets to the heart of the book and it's
maybe something i slightly disagree with you on or maybe not is that you make this big distinction
between children and adults um and that this is deeply immoral conduct to be doing it with children
it's immoral to be doing it with adults as well or are you are you focusing on the on the issue with
children precisely because that's going to get buy-in from a wider coalition of people or do you also have
a critique of this stuff happening to adult women i mean i i find a 30 year old woman being subject to
those dynamics also disgusting frankly and i think they should be prohibited so so where do you sit on
that yeah so it's it's two big reasons the biggest reason um is as a psychologist writing this book
really focused me on puberty in fact i didn't plan to write a chapter on puberty i planned to just have
two or three two chapters on childhood but i had to add a whole chapter on puberty um the brain is
growing the brain is growing rapidly in the first few years and then it kind of is full size but then
there's so much tuning it's all about neural tuning from age six through the early 20s it's not growth
it's just which ones which things wire up and the key period of neural rewiring is puberty and especially
early puberty i was also very influenced by the cutoff between millennials and gen z because the
millennials got instagram too when they were in college um it comes out in 2012. that's the the
year 2012 is the year where uh for the first time most people in america have a smartphone in 2010
teens look at it this way so in 20 suppose you're born in 1995 you're the last year of the millennials
what year were you born if i'm 84 sadly okay so you're right the older end of the millennials um
so if you're born in 95 which is the last year of the millennials you turn 15 in 2010 which means that
you went through early puberty you're still in puberty but the early part which is the most sensitive
you went through that with a flip phone or a brick phone as you say here or a you know a basic
phone you did not have a smartphone um that's 2012 2013 you might have gotten a smart but you went
through early puberty with a with a basic phone no front facing camera no high-speed internet no
instagram and your mental health is probably fine the millennials mental health is fine it's a creative
generation they go out they travel the world they're starting companies so the millennials are doing fine
but now suppose we look at a member of gen z suppose let's take a girl who's born in the year 2000
and what that means is that she turns 15 in 2015 and what that means is that she went through early
puberty she probably got a smartphone with a front-facing camera
she probably got on on instagram when she was 12 or 13 that's when all the girls rush on
and so she went through early puberty on social media much less human contact much less shared
laughter much less time in person with friends much more social comparison and she is gen z which means
her mental health is probably not good for the girls we're talking 30 40 percent have an anxiety
disorder or depression so it's there's never been such a sharp cutoff between generations and my hypothesis in
the book is that it's early puberty the people who got this phone-based lifestyle where they're on
five ten hours a day if they got it when they were over 16 or so their mental health isn't they might
be scrambled but they're they're not anxious and depressed whereas the ones who got it early they're
the ones who are most damaged so i think there's a sensitive period in early puberty and there's actually
research by andrew shibilsky and amy orbin and these are two people are generally skeptical of
the link their own research they have a really interesting study where they're able to look at
at how tight is the correlation between the time you spend on social media and poor mental health
what they find is that for girls the correlation is highest between 11 and 13 years old so that seems
to be the sensitive period for girls boys hit puberty a bit later for them it's like 13 to 15 is the most
sensitive period for harm and so i take all of these things as a psychologist and i say we know puberty is
the most sensitive time of brain development i mean in utero in the first two years are obviously
also very important but in terms of forming your identity developing self-control uh telling a story
about yourself all of this stuff this is really happening in early puberty it's the most important
period to protect and what do we do that's exactly when we give kids smartphones and social media in
britain um you i guess you have a secondary school what's it called but basically at 9 10 and 11 by 11
almost all your kids have smartphones and social media this is insanity i mean unless we have you
know unless we have proof that it's safe and we sure don't this is complete insanity and so that's the
main reason that i'm focused on kids um then the secondary reason is especially as an american where we
have a much stronger libertarian threat in our society um if you know if an adult wants to smoke
marijuana every day and risk addiction i'm not going to say they can't do that if an adult wants
to gamble and blow their family's money i'm not going to say they can't do that obviously the
companies are predatory i'd like to stop that and in the same way if you know if an adult woman wants
to spend uh you know five hours a day on instagram and make herself depressed i'm not going to say she
can't do that but i sure as hell i'm going to say the companies can't do that to my kids and the way
things are set up now we can't stop them as long as our kids can get to a browser anywhere in the world
they can create as many accounts as they want fake accounts no verification no age verification
so that is what makes me mad as hell and that's what makes me think that these companies especially
those three are immoral they own childhood they have no care for it they are trashing it and they
just don't seem to care i i agree with all that and it's funny you say about 9 10 11 my niece has just
got her first smartphone and she's 10 years old um i mean i personally think that's an unwise decision but
i don't want to create a family frackle and our conversation here i have to say though as a as an
older millennial i actually had an anxiety attack for the first time in 2011 2012 and it was because
of social media and phones so i've always actually been a very mentally resilient person and i think
one of the sort of paradoxes of things like that is that when you're resilient and quite mentally tough
you then take that to the extreme and what is a self-perceived strength becomes a vulnerability
because you you exploit it and it you know it you take it too far fundamentally and um long story short
um i was just using social media quite extensively i was part of my phd um as well looking at social
media and social movements oh wow yeah um just using it a lot and i started to for the first time in my
life actually have like heart palpitations and tremors sleeplessness and in retrospect and i had
an anxiety attack at one point and in retrospect this was being caused by the technology and for me
i think a combination of that and the housing crisis so you can't afford rent you're having to move
constantly and also this is going to sound incredibly sort of esoteric high consumption of
caffeine okay now these are the three things that 40 50 years ago people in their early to mid 20s
probably weren't doing to the same extent in in london right coffees were much smaller there back
then right or tea you know as i now drink yeah um and that in combination yeah gave me really really
strong anxiety tell me more what was happening on social media were you being criticized was it
reputation yeah that's what i figured that happened precisely yeah and and it's something i want to talk
about in a moment this idea of um conformity and prestige bias and how young people learn but of course
it's not just young people that you know think prestigious is super important and using things
like twitter at the time um you build social networks with strangers fundamentally and you think
their opinions and their views on who you are as a person you think that matters yeah which is actually
crazy as an older person now who's 41 i think it's insane but when you're in your mid-20s you don't
think that actually if all these people are saying you're horrible and nasty you take it on board and
it's very additive right one day you don't notice one week one month but then after 18 months actually
it really is you know wearing you down as a yeah as a person so i think it i think it did hit
millennials in a slightly different way where i think millennials are different is we weren't digital
natives and we have that hinterland of okay well i know this isn't actually real you know
but knowing reality doesn't really doesn't really shield you knowing that something isn't real
doesn't really shield you because these things are really acting on us unconsciously um the most
important thing to us i mean we can say it's our children and that probably that is uh you know
unconsciously but vying with that is our reputation is what people think about us and uh that is
certainly in many cultures men will die or risk death to avoid any stain on their honor any any loss of
prestige um and so we all live we all live in a prestige economy honor cultures are incredibly
intense about it um uh modern secular cultures are a little less so we don't fight duels anymore
but i had the same experiences of you it's it's it was times when i've been you know when when you're
being attacked on social media because you know we have these evolved sensors to detect oh is it just
like one person who doesn't like me or is my reputation shot and if if it's growing and more people are
saying it there's a kind of an unconscious panic alarm that goes off and so um we're adults and i
thought i was tough too but you know what when i'm being attacked on social media it seems to be
growing i i also get you know palpitations and and some really intense anxiety um and so and we're
adults and we're pretty competent effective adults imagine a 12 year old whose you know body
is changing they don't know where they fit they might have no friends or very few friends
so again i the idea that the idea that we have let childhood migrate onto what should be adult
only spaces where literally men are stalking them and algorithms are hooking them i mean it's this
should not be close this should not be a difficult discussion to have just children should not be on
these platforms i just want to share the most astonishing stat i've ever found uh we just put out
a post on snapchat we we drew from various lawsuits in the united states where they in the process of
discovery they got all kinds of quotations from snapchat employees internal reports memos emails
things like that um so there was one internal there were several internal emails about the very high
volume of sextortion that happens on snapchat sextortion is of course where someone is tricked into
sending a photo it's usually a boy a teenage boy tricked into sending a photo of himself that
shows his penis and once he sends that out the sextortionist has him and then he reveals i'm not
a sexy girl flirting with you i'm a sextortion ring based in another country and unless you pay us 500
you know pounds dollars right now i'm gonna share this photo with everyone you know and i'm gonna
send it to your parents um how many well i want to ask how many you think the number is 10 000 and
that's not a year 10 000 reports of sextortion a month that's what snapchat was getting two or three
years ago and there are multiple other emails about dealing with this dealing with you know this this
it is difficult or annoying topic of sextortion snapchat is is the most perfect platform for
strangers to approach children because the messages disappear there's a quick ad feature so
you're not only talking to people you know it's constantly suggesting people that you should
connect to based on friends of friends so if someone penetrates a group of kids then he's in
he get friends of friends um i believe looking on their platform i believe they even use spatial so
if you hang out near a school i'm not sure this is true i should be careful saying it but
i believe you can be added just by physical proximity not by connections
my point is this is a platform that is designed for illegal activity or at least is designed in ways
that are really good for people who want to do something illegal and that is especially sex and
drugs most of the deaths as far as i can tell are uh from fentanyl poisoning from because it's now so
easy to buy drugs of course when i was a kid you could buy drugs too but it was difficult and scary and
and on snapchat it's just like you just you know it's very easy to find the drug pages they advertise
they they'll send to you they'll deliver to you and since a lot of the drugs are made in home
laboratories where they use fentanyl instead of whatever percocet or whatever they're supposed to
be selling and the blender isn't even so some kids get get you know a pill made with a lot of
fentanyl they die um that's what a number of the lawsuits are so um so again you know this is
snapchat owns childhood um and they let this happen and it's frictionless as well right i mean
pornography is another one pornography has always existed i don't think we should ban pornography but
i think there should be an amount of friction which is to say you have to go into a shop you
have to overcome the stigma you have to buy the magazine whereas now anybody can just click on a
url child or adult and they can see stuff which was just incomprehensible to my grandfather's
generation what impact is that having on young boys yeah so um uh so if you think about sexual
development you know you you're you're in an age seven eight nine where sex is kind of disgusting and
you know it's the what freud called the latency period and then gradually you find yourself getting
a little bit interested around 10 or 11 or 12 is usually when the first flashes of interest whether
you're straight or gay um seem to come out and you know i remember like noticing there was a model
cheryl teague she was a blonde model in the 70s like noticing that she was very beautiful and it
sort of gradually progresses and at some point i have no idea when oh my my best friend and we were
10 or 11. we found somebody thrown out a porno magazine it was like jugs or something was called
and we it was like this you know trophy and we hit it we divided up we hit it under our our mattresses
and things like that so you know we'd seen naked women but we never saw you know anal sex up close
we never saw a gangbang with you know and we never saw strangling and beating and you imagine
you know you imagine a 10 11 12 year old especially a girl so if we look at the in terms of boys what
do they think is normal what do they think they're supposed to do and we know that that young that boy
that young men are sometimes choking girls during sex because that's what they saw they think the
girls like it so much yeah so that's distorting them the boys sexual development um and think about
girls there's a huge decline in the number of girls who say they're heterosexual or who say they
want children well maybe it's because partly because there are many reasons but maybe it's
partly because their exposure to sex is disgusting like i you know why would you if you're a 12 year
old girl why would you aspire to this so i think in so many ways gen z is already the loneliest generation
in history and it's very hard for them to connect now the dating apps make it even harder
and i think pornography is clearly dip it's it's it's making it much easier for the boys to just
check out there was an article in atlantic recently about how how many young men are using porn not
because they can't get a woman but they actually prefer it they actually it's you know it's much
easier it's much more erotic um and so you know if sex and dating uh diminish enormously you know what
future do we have to say nothing of the happiness loss of people who are going to be having sex with
ai or you know masturbating with their ais so you would you would say that gen z having less sex than
millennials gen x which we know yeah which was indisputable you think that stands to pornography
primarily oh no no no i can't say that but no i'm just no i don't or it's a variable i'm just i'm
yeah i'm just saying it's a contributor i'm pretty confident that it's a contributor and again this
recent article in the atlantic also made that made that point it stands to reason um in all of these
things whether we're talking about you know the ease of buying drugs the ease of buying pornography
marrow everything part of what's happening there's a really great book oh my god there's a book that
you would love called the age of addiction by david courtright it's an analysis of the sort of the the
the social history of pleasure and you know originally it was sugar you know people you know
for millions of years humans wanted fruit and we pick fruit and then we discovered how to dry it and
then we discover the you know the you know europe discovers america you get sugarcane oh my god you've
caught you know so things get more and more concentrated and as it gets more and more
concentrated there's more of a market incentive to concentrate it and sell it and it becomes more
addictive um the marijuana that is smoked now um is so much is so much more powerful has nothing to
do with the marijuana that i smoked in the 70s with my friends and i just learned you have this
horrible thing here i can't believe this is legal these little uh nicotine pouches do you know what these
are the kids the kids can buy they're legal because they don't have any tobacco and your laws are
such that if there's no tobacco you can give it to kids so it's a nicotine pouch and some of them
have as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes so you know the concentrations go up and up and up the
addictive power goes up and up and up the availability goes up and up and up and before you know it
you have a country with addicted kids and so sorry to keep ranting here but this is really the
one of the things that i'm most upset about we talked about the girl story now let's shift to
the boy's story the boy's story the key thing i'm finding i didn't know this when i started the book
but the key thing is to keep your eyes on their dopamine circuits we all talk about dopamine this
dopamine that we all know dopamine is the neurotransmitter that's released when you get a
little bit of pleasure or i should say when you make a little progress towards an evolutionary goal you
get you know you you bite a potato chip you you master a stage in a video game so we get a little hit of
dopamine and that doesn't satisfy us it doesn't it's not like ah that felt great i'm going to stop
now it's more like oh that felt good i i want to do it again do it again and your daughter is soon
going to be saying that over and over again again again because something's exciting she went again
again and what the story is with boys i believe is the number and variety of companies that are now
making billions and trillions of dollars by addicting boys is is revolting to me so it begins
with the video games now video games are complicated i'm not saying don't ever let kids play it but the
number of parents i've talked to is boys are lost to video games that's all they do they can't get
them off they have no life they learn no skills they're they get angry when they're taken off
you know if we're losing five to ten percent of our boys just to video games these are boys who are not
going to be successful in life unless they can get off quickly um so it starts with the video games moves
on to porn and that's the most painful one you talk to parents whose boys are lost to porn because
they're so ashamed of it um but they're you know so a lot of boys get addicted to porn um and then
there's vaping tobacco nicotine zin um then there's marijuana pens you kids can you know and what they're
smoking is like so much more powerful um and this is just by the time they're 15. now they can also begin
to gamble not legal but there are all kinds of roundabout ways that you can begin gambling and a lot of
video games have gambling like features anna lemke one of the uh one of my country's most uh
most well-known addiction researchers at stanford um she says in her book dopamine nation that any
if you have one addiction if you develop one addiction you're more subject to all future
addictions your your dopamine circuits are down regulated that means that means you're more in a
state of withdrawal habitually if a boy is doing uh dopamine act uh dopamine related activities for
a third of his day then the other two-thirds are painfully boring and that includes school
so this i think is the boy's story it's not social media causing boys to be depressed we're not seeing
that what we're seeing is multiple platforms especially video games porn and then plus nicotine marijuana
plus i you know crypto investing and investing investing has been gamified young people especially
i think young men need to learn how to save invest become a provider someday um and instead we hand
them over to gambling companies and the more they bet you know the house always wins so the more they
spend time on on sports gambling platforms the more likely they are to go bankrupt so this is really
the boy's story if we look in at kids at 14 it looks like the girls are doing worse because
they're more depressed and anxious but gen z is now turning 30 and if we look in at the 28 year old
young men and women i think what we're seeing is that the girls are much more likely to have
gone to university graduated university gotten a job and be functional in the world and the boys
are substantially more likely to still be living at home playing video games what you're describing is
us building in addiction to childhood yes every single level every level from the age of two or three
because our two in the us have 40 of our two-year-olds have their own ipad i couldn't believe
that when i read it yeah two-year-olds yeah because look and you guys are no better i just i don't have
the ipad stats for the uk but we do have smartphone stats for the uk and i think it's something like
oh gosh what was it it was like was it 25 percent 25 of your six-year-olds have their own iphone have
their own smartphone so in both countries parents have discovered i'm busy i've got a lot to do
you're crying here just take take the phone just take the phone you're happy i'm happy i can do my
thing we've all discovered it's effective as a babysitter but again again so would be morphine
what you're describing is just so um it's evil frankly it is i mean i i feel bad when i'm with my
daughter and i'm just looking at my phone even quickly if i've got a notification i feel bad i know
that's bad parenting i know that's bad parenting i want to talk about television a little bit later
on uh get some some tips from you uh but before i do prestige bias conformity bias i just want to
nail this down to things really important you said that young people children learn through play
but also these these two particular biases are how they really structure learning and their entrance
into adulthood what are then why do they matter so much so this is something that was interesting
thinking to come out of evolutionary research um my friend and colleague joe henrich uh at harvard
and uh and his advisors had developed you know so the interesting thing is that of course darwinian
biological evolution shaped our genome there's really no doubt about that but once we became cultural
creatures you have this second strand of evolution which is culture and our cultural innovations like for
example cooking well that then feeds back and changes the way our guts evolve you don't need such a
long intestine if you're cooking your meat that was an early example but in all kinds of ways um we um
humans have become a species in which survival isn't to the fastest or even the strongest it's to the one
who learns the best and uh so so there's a lot of evolution to optimize brains to be the best learners
and so uh henrich and his and his team they identified several but the two that i thought
were most relevant here were one was conformity bias so um you shouldn't so first of all there's
no point in copying your parents i mean your your child is going to copy you for a few years but once
she's seven or eight she's not going to copy you she's going to copy other kids and um so when she goes
to school no matter what you say she's going to want to fit in and wear the clothing that fits in
because it's a pretty good rule when in rome do as the romans do you can't really go wrong with that
so we have a strong conformity bias especially when we're new in a place where we're insecure
and so when you put your kids on social media they're going to become little conformists and
all the girls are going to dress the same they're going to pose the same way sort of influenced by porn
and these are 10 year old girls who don't know they're doing porn poses but they'll be
you know you look at girls on instagram and the thousands of pictures they put of themselves on
instagram it's so sad um so they're gonna become conformists so that's bad um we should not encourage
them to be conformist to weirdos on the internet we should encourage them to fit into their local
environment but then more interesting is what they call prestige bias because you can do better than
copying the average why copy the average why not copy the person who's most prestigious and so we're
very very good at detecting coming to new situation we're all very good at detecting who's the one that
people look up to who's the one that people want to be near who's the one who is just regarded as
higher prestige and our our minds will just go right to that and we're much more like that's why
kids want to dress like celebrities that's why celebrity endorsements are worth money
and so prestige bias until very recently prestige was gained by actually doing something you had to
be a great basketball player you had to be a great actress you had to be a great hunter or or
basket weaver or storyteller and that's how you got prestige was actually doing something that
people respect and then younger people want to be like you but the guys who built these social media
platforms they hacked the system and they did it knowingly intentionally cleverly because they created
systems on which how do you get prestige all that matters is the number and so you know if you have
200 000 followers on instagram you are an influencer i don't know what the number is these days but the
point is they hacked it so that the number is always there the followers likes retweets all that's always
there and young people are just competing to get those numbers up i just had a conversation with a
wonderful you have a wonderful british british author uh young writer uh freya india she has a
sub stack called girls and she has a book out coming out called girls and she's been writing for my
sub stack also after about she's a fantastic writer about what gen z girls are going through so we just
had lunch today she lives here in london um and and she was telling me about the many gen z i was
asking her are there you know are there other gen z writers like what give me examples of gen z who are
like producing things writing being creative and she said she often comes across um young people
who say they they want they want to be a youtuber uh and they want to get uh have a big youtube uh you
know uh they want to have a lot of followers okay what are you going to talk about i don't know i don't
know you know you know they it's not like there's a thing that they're experts on that people like
that's just the goal is just get the followers and that's sad it's sad when young people are not
motivated to do anything they're just motivated to get followers and that's how they hacked the system
see neil postman would say all of that now you know deceased media critic he would say all of
that in regards to television 30 40 50 years ago he'd say something yeah you're right he would have
said in a in a literary culture abraham lincoln can become the president of the united states in a
culture with television no chance so a lot of this stuff necessarily isn't that new you're just saying
it's massively intensified or yes no that's a very good point um and the the main criticism leveled
against me is this is just another moral panic just like television and video games early video
games and comic books and history does rhyme um there are many similarities that's true and i think
i don't know who who coined the phrase famous for being famous but that came out of the television
era it's not new with in the 21st century so you're right a lot of this is true whenever you get
a technological revolution in communication you get big downstream changes so okay that's definitely
true but here are some of the differences that make this much more pernicious especially for young
people so television and here i'm drawing on um robert putnam's amazing work bowling alone the loss of
social capital uh and what putnam points out is that the combination of television and the automobile
had enormous effects in the united states people stopped being out on their front porch stopped
seeing their neighbors life comes inside on the sofa watching the television and then you're in
your car by yourself but at least watching a television is something that you did with your
family and friends i mean sometimes we watched alone but i have a lot of fond memories of watching
tv programs with my sisters and with my friends and we'd play we'd fight we'd talk we'd make jokes so it
still is sociable um second the tv was not portable so it could only it was a thing that you did
there was no way the tv could take up every moment of your day it couldn't take up the time you're
waiting for an elevator it couldn't take up the time you're sitting on the toilet it couldn't take
up lulls in conversation over lunch with a friend so tv was much more limited much more social and tv
told stories that were written by adults that had characters moving through a moral world so i grew up
watching all these little sitcoms that were kind of stupid now that i look back on them my kids say
dad you what this was stupid that's true but there was always it was it was not written by people in
my generation was not written by other 10 year olds it was written by adults from previous generation
and there was there are elements of good and bad and honesty and moral conflicts so it all of it
contributes to our story consumption humans are storytelling animals and television was actually
a pretty good way to convey long stories 25 minutes long for most shows and then you know an hour
or two for movies whereas what are our kids getting today um if you give them a smart device and this
is my main warning to you here with young kids distinguish between story time which is good
nothing until she's three or four no screens other than you know facetime no screens till she's three or
four at least and then later on if she wants to if you want to have her watch a movie with you or with
a friend or a sibling that's great there's nothing wrong with that screens are not automatically bad or
dangerous they can convey stories what's bad is fragmenting time do not give your daughter any
fragmenting time until she is 14 minimum and what i mean by that is if you give them a smart device
touchscreen device they're not just going to do one thing they're going to do multiple things and they
get very they get very very good a smart device teaches a child to be an exquisite judge of is this the
most interesting thing i could be doing right now i've been on this video for 10 seconds already
eh not so promising let me switch oh this one's better oh yeah this one's better so uh fragmenting
time is not social it's private it's not stories in a moral world it's little fragments 10 second
videos 20 second videos uh it mostly ends up with the short videos that includes youtube shorts
and television didn't customize what it showed for you versus your sister you both had to watch the
same programs whereas social media or a lot of anything with a feed is getting better and better
and better at hooking your child at hooking you as an individual so yes structurally some of the same
things are similar to television but again the dose makes the poison and if you take whatever the
changes were from television multiplying by 10 that changes a lot of parameters in human development
human society yeah so there was that similar image um at the inauguration where you had mark
zuckerberg jeff bezos elon musk spouses etc does that worry you that combination of extraordinary
political power um alongside big tech and and some of these firms which you weren't especially positive
about yes it terrifies me sometimes there are ways to get rich without making people better off there
are ways to get rich by harming people and that's what i think these companies have pioneered ways of
doing of extracting attention and information from people um and these companies as i've already
argued today and in the book i believe are severely damaging childhood across the western world we don't
have a lot of data from asia or africa but across the western world at an industrial scale and the
hopes for regulation were already slim in my country at the federal level although many states are acting
and when you have the leaders of the wealthiest most powerful companies on the stage with donald trump
who has shown that he will change his mind on tech regulation if one of his donors asks him to as he did
with tick tock it was his idea that tick tock should be banned because it's a national security threat
during his first term that was his idea and so the fact that i live in a in a country in which constraints
on power are increasingly being shaken off in which the u.s congress the republicans in congress seem
not capable of doing their job which is uh acting as a control on a president who's violating the the
constitutional order so what this means is that i think i think we are approaching something more like
the authoritarian countries that have always been our enemies an authoritarian country in which what
matters is loyalty not to the constitution or the law or the country but to the leader so it is extremely
frightening to watch my country descend into something that i do not recognize as america
people have used that word fascism and i'm not suggesting that that's right or wrong yeah that's
the wrong word but i i do wonder this disintegration of attention clearly attention the ability to reflect
on uh things properly the capacity of critical judgment that is key that's the cornerstone of effective
citizenship that's right so if you erode that and then you combine that with authoritarian tendencies it does
suggest that democracy won't really endure for for very long that's the fear that's my fear that's
right plato understood the weaknesses of democracy he said that it's the second worst form of government
because it always descends into tyranny because the people are passionate easily led astray a demagogue
comes along speaks to their fears their uh their their tribalism uh and the founding fathers read plato
they knew that and they designed a careful system to keep a check on that but they always knew
it's fragile and they were very clear those who wrote the constitution and then argued about it and
got enacted very clear that it can only work if the people have the corresponding virtues it doesn't run
itself it's like think about as a giant complicated clock and if you don't have any clock mechanics if
the people just take it for granted and even you know throw oranges at it or whatever you want to
say it's not going to work and i think that um as we've been losing social capital and trust as we've
been losing a sense of our history and our traditions as we've been losing a sense of anything that connects
us to the past i think we are becoming worse and worse clock mechanics and um um at least american
democracy i think is in a very very um dangerous state uh all that's left is the supreme court to act as
a check on power uh and someday maybe the the congress will do its job but there's not much sign of that
yet um so that is the great fear that at the moment of maximum peril for democracy
our people are getting certainly more fragmented less able to pay attention our information ecosystem
is becoming less able to find truth and this is in the first days of ai as ai makes it easy for
everybody to generate whatever they want we will have no idea what's true in a couple of years
so our people are in a sense getting stupider and this is not just true for young people the recent ft
article brought together study showing its adults too we're all getting less able to think to read
to learn new things so we're getting in a sense stupider at the same time as ai is getting smarter
and as powerful people are getting more powerful this to me is a very frightening combination of
trends so final question what is to be done as somebody once said you've got four proposals
specifically with regards to children and turning their ship around what are they
yeah so um i was originally going to write a book on what social media is doing to democracy and it
was going to be called life after babel adapting to a world we may never again share and i thought
a lot about what we can do to change the technological environment to make it more conducive to democracy
and that's really hard and i don't really know what we could do and if i did we wouldn't do it at
least not in america because everything would have been partisan and you know any anything here would
help one side so so fortunately uh or at least uh um kind of fortunately i didn't write that book
because i started that book with the chapter on what's happening to kids what technology is doing
to kids and once i saw once i saw the especially the graphs the international graphs once i saw this
is happening around the world i decided to put off the book on democracy and to just focus on the kids
and what i realized by the end of the book is that the reason this we we sunk so far so fast the reason
why almost all kids have a smartphone in the uk in the us and they're all on instagram and snapchat and
tick tock is because we're all stuck in a set of collective action problems every kid has to be on
because every other kid is on and so the way to break out of a collective action trap is collectively
is with collective action and so in the book i propose four norms that if we don't all have to do
them but if a lot of us do them we roll back the phone-based childhood so the first is no smartphone or
ipad no no smart no touchscreen device um until a kid is 14. um i don't mean they can never use yours
i'm just saying don't give them their own because it will move to the center of their lives and take
over for at least half the kids so delay that until he's 14. the second rule is no social media until 16.
really it should be 18 we should recognize these platforms are adult only they're not just not
appropriate to be putting children in contact with strangers but my goal was not to specify the best age
for an individual my goal as a social psychologist was to identify what could work as a norm something
that we could all agree to as a floor and that i think is 16 for social media the third norm is
phone-free schools and this is the one that is happening at lightning speed around the world
most schools said oh we don't allow phone use during class which as my kids told me means you
have to hide it in a book or under your desk or go to the bathroom um but schools but what we're urging
is that all schools must go phone free from the time the kids arrive at school they turn in anything
that can send or receive texts uh gets put in a locked pouch or in a phone locker they get it back
at the end of the day when schools do that they get miraculous results and they all say the same
thing we hear laughter in the hallways again the kids actually come to like it within a couple weeks
and then they're much more attentive and the fourth norm is far more independence free play and
responsibility in the real world because this is not really a book about social media my goal here
isn't let's all freak out about social media my goal is let's let's look at childhood and that was
your first question to me let's look at what makes a good childhood an enjoyable childhood a healthy
childhood childhood where you'll become a competent adult and so it's not just taking away the screens we
have to give our kids back outdoor play time with other kids let them get into an argument let them
settle it uh in america we're terrified that kids in a playground will get in an argument so we have
to have someone there to intervene no stop doing that um so in all the english-speaking countries we
have this problem northern europe not so much but they're moving that way from what i hear they're
moving towards the overprotection um so if we do those four things we restore human childhood and i
think we will then see if any community that does all four where your kids are don't have the phone
at all during the day and no one's on social media till they're 16 and many more kids are outside
having a great time and having adventures and exploring and going and getting pizza or ice
cream or whatever riding their bikes a world like that i believe is one in which we will start to see
those extraordinary graphs of mental illness and self-harm begin to come down i can't say they'll come
all the way back to where they were in 2010 but i think that these are the biggest things we can do
to bring down these alarming mental health stats and if you do all of them combined it costs about
zero dollars none of these cost anything you can even do phone free schools with just envelopes in
the front of the room so i think we need to at least try them there's no cost to doing these things
people who are experimenting with them are having great results let's do them
