all right i am now joined uh by two people who've both been on the show before uh matt brunig
and luke savage uh who have uh both written reviews of this book abundance by ezra klein
and uh derek thompson um and i think basically if you have you know if you've been on i guess a
certain kind of political twitter in uh in the last month uh this like discourse about this book
was pretty inescapable uh for for a while and uh for a long time i was i was kind of confused about
why right like if if this is like you know to the extent that this is like a sort of book about why
you know liberals should care more about zoning reform and stuff that that that doesn't seem like
it would necessarily inspire it but uh both of you wrote interesting things about this that i mean
kind of helped me see that there are like there's a broader set of interesting issues here so uh matt
wrote uh this one at the people's policy project called the abundance agenda and uh and luke wrote
one called the paucity of of abundance um and so i i guess just to sort of catch up anybody who
has managed to to escape this uh luke do you want to just kind of start us off with like a general sense
of like what this book is about like what the what the deal is what klein and thompson are trying to
get people to care about sure i mean part of the reason i wanted to write about it and and why i
actually took time to read the book is because i really could not discern from you know just what
was kind of floating around in the discourse uh what exactly people were getting so worked up about
in either direction um i couldn't understand why a book that seemed to be about uh yeah municipal
zoning reform and that kind of thing uh was generating so much discourse and i i decided
that i i needed to find out so i mean uh basically the you know the the sort of ambient uh impression
that you might have from what is uh you know from from what what you've seen floating around on twitter
and elsewhere is correct right the book's uh kind of basic thrusts are just that there are various
administrative and regular regulatory costs associated with uh housing especially but also
with other things like transportation infrastructure and energy and so on um there's a similar kind
of uh you know in the second half it gets into kind of similar ideas around uh there being too
much risk aversion in in how scientific research is conducted and and uh innovation and that sort
of thing um and there's sort of this uh i guess other narrative or this structuring narrative that
there is a scarcity mindset that has captured uh the the left of american politics and what they mean
by the left is itself kind of an interesting question to explore uh but also the right so this is a
ostensibly a supply side liberalism that they're offering us and uh the thing that makes the book
kind of strange is that it begins with this grand utopian sketch of the future um and so there's
for me there was just something inherently quite interesting about like how disparate these two
poles are on the one hand you've got the minimalism of zoning reform and such and you have
a story about american politics that sounds quite third way-ish and just sounds like you know we need
to deregulate things and and remove constraints from uh private economic actors and so on and then on the
other hand it's like but if we do that uh you know if cleveland has better zoning reform or zoning laws
or whatever we're gonna have like we're gonna live in the jetsons by 2050 so that's a that's a that's
a broad sketch of the book yeah so so matt uh you know you you said in your uh your review right that
uh you kind of talk about the sort of main policy argument being like luke was saying about
administrative burdens on construction and then there's the sort of secondary argument about
innovation and science research and you're right the authors seem to think these two arguments the
dozens of sub-arguments following them all fit together because they relate back to abundance
a word that just means growth and innovation um but you know lots of problems relate back to growth
and innovation but that does not mean they all avail themselves of similar analysis and solutions
of course if you treat various policy topics as separate issues requiring their own specifically
tailored technocratic solutions you don't really have a book you have a list of discrete proposals
that could make up one section of project 2029 white paper but don't amount to a political
manifesto yeah yeah and i think that's where um the kind of discourse in some ways uh clumsily
in other ways more you know cleverly that's really where people are jumping off that's where all the heat
is if you will uh the the specifics of the proposals are kind of here nor you know it's like okay fine you
know you you want to you want to make it to like one of the proposals is we want more early career
scientists to get grant funding yeah okay sure why not um so you know you but but when it then becomes this thing and
like like like luke was saying that um this is actually about uh the scarcity mindset of
people like bernie sanders and donald trump and we need to break through all of that then you start
asking yourself well wait a minute what do you mean break through all of that you know uh if you
if you don't like what bernie was doing what aspects of bernie do you not like and are we really
going to abandon those things and so what i've what i kind of read out of this it's kind of hard to pull
it out perfectly because it's not like they have a paragraph where they're where they're like here
are the all the agendas that we want to put to the side and really focus on growth and innovation
it's just sort of sprinkled throughout and um of course as i'm reading and i'm i'm always looking
at like what what about the welfare state what about the welfare state that's sort of one of the main
tent poles of all you know left liberal politics for forever and ever right going back hundred plus
years right uh so are we is that one of the things you think we're focused too much on and i think
that they basically suggest that it is um i have this quote in my piece where they say for decades
american liberalism has measured its successes and how near it could come to the social welfare system
of denmark and then you know dot dot dot we need a liberalism that builds um and i think it's a mistake
i think we should maintain our our interest in the welfare state and and and it's uh if not centrality
close to centrality uh to you know in our project yeah i mean this is this is something you you both
highlighted and i mean um you know luke you've you've sort of written extensively over the years about
like what the last few decades of american liberalism have been like so you know just uh
uh mother of all softball questions but i mean is is is it your impression that american liberalism
uh has has tended over the last few decades to measure its success by how closely it approximates
nordic social democracy i mean it's it's baffling right uh what's happening here is baffling and and
as with so much of the so many of the kind of narratives that structure this book they're quite evasive about
you know what it is they're actually saying both in the sense that uh you know matt just uh described
where you know there's no there's no paragraph where they say we we reject redistribution they do
have some negative language about uh redistribution where they sort of say like they describe it
and i think quite conservative terms as a parceling out of the present yeah um you know we can't
redistribute what we don't have etc etc which i think is an incorrect view of of of what
redistribution is but um because i i happen to think you know there are no panaceas in politics
but economic redistribution is about as close to a panacea solution for for many uh big political and
social questions as as exists um but uh no i mean this is baffling um and there are other places
where they you know i think there are similar sleights of hand um it seems to me it's quite the
opposite you know american liberalism has uh in some ways always been distinct from uh you know the kind of
uh welfarism that we've seen in uh you know that we've seen in like northern and central europe but
uh since the since 1980s and 90s right it seems to me that american liberalism has defined itself
precisely in opposition to uh like the the universality that's so central to um nordic social
democracy to uh decommodification right because so much of what the nordic model is about is taking
things out of the market entirely um and then but there's another very telling paragraph i'll just
quote from here where it seems to me when they're describing the welfare state either they are
deliberately and willfully misrepresenting what uh you know the social democratic welfare model is or
they just don't they just literally don't understand it i'm curious what matt thinks about that but
they write progressives promises and policies for decades were built around giving people money or
money like vouchers to go out and buy something that the market was producing but that the poor
could not afford the aca subsidizes insurance that people can use to pay for health care food stamps
give people money for food you know housing vouchers tax credits for child care social security and so
on the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit give them more money for uh anything they want
etc etc again that's not nordic welfarism and it seems to me that in sort of conflating and seeming to
conflate uh scandinavian social democracy with what is essentially the clinton slash obama you know
approach of means testing everything and uh subsidizing the private market rather than replacing it with
public goods and universal programs uh it seems i my reading of that was that they're just uh sort of
you know there's a sleight of hand going on here where they've just found an oblique way to make the
normal uh you know the the the familiar centrist critique of uh of social democracy yeah i agree
and i think you know uh it's funny i it's it's true of course that the other pillars of uh what goes
into sort of nordic welfare uh politics they are missing entirely right they it is redistributive yes
but then it does a b and c as well it creates you know like you said these universal programs it pulls
things out of the market it creates certain entitlements that are separate from the market
it gives people power in the workplace because they have alternative income options all this is
whatever they don't they miss all that and it's just sort of like what literally is happening some
money is getting moved around we kind of did that too but i think the other thing that's going on here
is they really want to try to draw a distinction between you know increasing supply and changing
distribution um and to sort of view those things as at odds with one another um and so or another way
to put it is um because i think that section you're talking about they kind of go on to say that um
you know this is sort of just kind of stoking demand stoking demand right so the the the libs
and the left they're so focused on giving people money so that they can go do demand and but actually
what we need is supply because if you give people money to demand that you know a voucher to nowhere
if you don't have supply and like they're kind of playing with supply and demand supply and demand
right and you know i would rephrase it as like production and distribution and that might be a
cleaner way to think about it like you have certain ideas about how we should change production and
that's all well and good it's kind of different and separate altogether from the question of
distribution because the question of distribution is not just as they say parceling out the present
which in which we imagine like we have sort of like an existing set of widgets and trinkets
and we're all just kind of moving them around it's about structuring how distribution will occur
now and in the future right how is the production that you want to achieve how is it going to go
out to people in what proportion and what at what levels of inequality that's what the welfare state
and other you know institutions in you know this sort of egalitarian playbook does and so to present
that is like well all redistribution could be about is the present like no like we we have we have new
stuff to distribute all the time and your whole thing is you're going to create more new stuff to
distribute so there's still the question of to whom and in what quantities and to say that we can kind of
put that aside it's like well then what is even the point of the production let's say we produced all
the cool stuff you wanted to produce but only gave it to one person is that have we achieved something
you know not to reduce it all the way to like that kind of absurd thing but it starts to get your mind
going on why actually you know to achieve their own goals they need to think about distribution
yeah i mean i i think that um one thing that i was really um really surprised by right is there a
couple paragraphs where they're talking about uh karl marx uh getting into uh to my interests that they
say uh comparatively abundance is returned to an older tradition of leftist thought in the communist
manifesto karl marx and frederick ingalls acknowledge that capitalism was superior to its predecessor feudalism
in producing goods and wealth uh and they they quote the communist manifesto and the sort of
wonders that have been wrought by capitalism uh they did not want to end this revolution in
production they wanted to accelerate it just as feudalism blocked production that only capitalism
could unleash so did capitalism constrain an abundance that a new paradigm might really unleash i
think it's the only time i've ever heard that referred to as new paradigm i like it uh
according to this analysis of the economy was an idea that's come to be called the fed arena of
production marx observed that many companies obsession with profit kept the entire economy
from exploring ideas that threatened incumbent margins or failed to produce immediate returns
among capitalism's many sins marx wrote was that it prevented the most wondrous and useful
technology from being invented deployed in the first place an economy run amok with useless
federating serves the rich few at the expense of the poor many marx's aim was not to return the
abundance machine off but to direct its ends towards a shared abundance to unburden the four uh forces of
production and make possible what would have been impossible to imagine there's much he got wrong
but one need not be a communist to see the wisdom in this analysis and i've got to say this is just like
the strangest description of like what what marx sort of thinks about the the progressive uh you know
achievements of capitalism that i've ever heard because other than that one word shared that's
that's that's sort of smuggled in there right like that's like it's it's like even carl marx of this
telling like it's it's like they presented as if his only objection to capitalism was was that it didn't
produce enough stuff right like like not you know not that like oh look you know on the one hand
capitalism has this created this tremendous productive capacity you know and on the other hand um
you know the working class majority you know does doesn't uh you know doesn't benefit from it in the
way that they should because you know because of the the way property relations you know are are
structured i mean it's it's like um you know it it is it is sort of remarkably strange because i think
usually that the sort of uh like uh sort of simplification of marks would be the other way
around right that that's that's like all he cares about is distribution yeah yeah but uh but in you
know but it's like look i mean so clearly marx does care quite a bit about distribution i think they're
conf they they're conflating i mean oh my god what they're not to be too obvious here but they're
conflating the sort of like uh dialectical materialists like predictions about how this
is going to go with a sort of his nor like normative politics which i mean i know like that's kind of
sort of the whole thing the marxists get very touchy about is that you don't complete those two things
but i i did i kind of blipped over that part of the book i was actually at the playground with my
child when it was reading and i was like oh whatever uh we're at the end here let's just power
through but it is funny because there is a way in which you could say hey uh you know what is mark's
pointing out here he's pointing out that capitalism contains within it certain kinds of contradictory
institutions that will end up fettering production and you know you could start from there and be like
how would i write a book that is about this topic from that perspective and some of it might be
overlapping you could be like very interesting so we create this uh personal private asset in
ownership of land and space and structures and lo and behold people because of the creation of that
institution with a uniquely capitalist kind of concept um and and and it becomes fully marketized
not just i live in my house i worry about the number the dollar amount that you know the house moves
or i can actually now go on zillow and see a chart of my house's value as if it's like a stock ticker
um and the people in that situation now are like don't build the new rail line by my house don't build
the new uh energy facility in fact don't build an apartment because they're trying to defend the
property institutions and so yes like there's such an inherent you know problem here and then of course
be like so and then marx will say well you know then that's going to have to give away to a more
socialized approach right where we and you know you could go there and like they but they don't
obviously the the fact that hey we're gonna have to figure out what are we gonna do with the fact
that our property relations is what is fettering and in their own telling the creation of all this extra
production um and will are we getting we may need to tackle that move in a whole other different way to
think about property and homes and whatever it's like no just tweak that zoning reform and that's
and then we solve the thing that marx didn't like which was the fettering of production
this this this flourish about marx i mean this is like this is intellectually lazy uh to an extent that
if you put this on an undergraduate essay i feel like you'd be you'd be called out by a ta or prof who
was marking it because what they're essentially saying here is is oh you know you lefties you
know in the tradition of karl marx think that marx and engels were against the production of more
stuff and we're here to tell you that we're the true you know heirs to marks and angles because
we like stuff unlike you like you people afflicted with the scarcity mindset like this is so stupid it
makes me think of it's like those things from like billionaire magazine where it'll be a meme with
i don't know martin luther king or i don't know if they've done deb's yet but then it'll have a quote
that's just like a success win quote that could just as easily have come from andrew carnegie or
something yeah that's kind of the level of analysis we're dealing with over a super yacht yeah exactly
like it's worthy of a this is worthy of a tom friedman column or something it's it's it's ridiculous
yeah so i i like i think as silly again as silly as that marks flourish is i mean it's it's it's kind
of worth pointing out because it might say something about their the sort of like monomaniacal focus on
on you know production as as the only thing that matters because like matt something you you pointed
out in the in your review i like this i like this point is that normally you'd be very unsympathetic
to somebody who was like mad at a book because of what wasn't in it right that like it's it's like
uh you know somebody you know somebody writes a book about zoning reform you're like oh why aren't
you talking about medicare for all it's like like normally that'd be a very silly criticism right
because it's like wow that's just a different book right like what are you complaining about
um but in this case the way that they frame it actually does make that a legitimate criticism
because uh because it it is you know very explicitly not just like oh here are some interesting problems
and here are some solutions you know to to the sort of particular problems that we're concerned with but
it is very explicitly framed as a sort of manifesto for you know what kind of liberalism uh you know we
need you know what that liberalism should be focused on you know and so so so given that i mean it's like
look if you if you uh if you're if you're making this grand argument about you know priorities then then
suddenly all that stuff is actually on the table right that it's like no it's it's if you you know
if if you're you know if you're deprioritizing you know redistribution of wealth for example um
because that's just you know the parceling out of the uh the present and we should be focusing
on on an abundant future right then like then it actually does become a relevant criticism it's like no
no actually you know parceling out the present or future is actually really important yeah absolutely yeah
i mean another way to think about it is almost like you know different levels of analysis um you
know so you think about you know people have kind of like a philosophical framework world view maybe
under there you could think of like an intermediate thing that involves the population of certain
policy goals that like relate back to the philosophical framework and then you've got like
policy particulars like how do we go at those goals so you can kind of think about those three levels
and when i actually when i when i when i started to read the book it seems like i read it for the
same reason luke did because i saw all this stuff and i was like what's going on here is this because
it just seems like okay some policy particulars you know here's how we achieve the uh here's
here's how we achieve the carbon-free future okay well whatever you've got your view on it someone
else has some other view whatever that that could be interesting that could be fun i don't know why
everyone's so pissed off about it um but then you see oh no no no they're they're not just operating on the
policy particular level they're uh at least on the policy goal level and at times at the like
philosophical framework level and uh but but very poorly very poorly uh and so you know if you're
starting to dip your toe in those levels then now that opens up the whole terrain for people to be like
well no no no no no no if this is you're going to be your philosophical outlook that's wrong it's got
to be this one and if this is going to be the policy goal the set of policy goals that are uh you
know supreme over all others well now we need to talk about all these other goals that are implicitly
not supreme and so they you know uh you know in a sort of lawyer sense open the door um and now you
know everyone is coming in and so once i read the book i was like okay okay i get it i see where where
where people are headed with it um and yeah you know i think it's um i don't think they do a very
good job on that part but like like you said at the very beginning it's kind of like the book is really
only interesting if you bring in that part if you don't bring in that part it's almost not even a
book you know it's like a white paper yeah there's a there's a writer on substack uh joe uh joe joe mile
who uh you know he he has he kind of speculates and i think this is pretty reasonable speculation that
you know this book a lot of which is cribbed directly from you know columns that thompson and
klein wrote i've been writing i think since 2021 or 2022 um you know that they kind of wrote it
assuming that there was going to be another democratic presidency so either another biden
term or a kamala harris one and so you know they may have had to kind of quite uh suddenly uh affix
this much grander story to it uh both in terms of uh you know positioning it as an agenda as like a new
agenda for the democratic party like this is how we win back power um you know uh and you know of
course they're now doing that at a time when the populist left not the kind of centrist wonks are
leading the you know the resistance to donald trump you know there's they're you know positioning the
book and they do do this exclusive or explicitly in the conclusion right they position it as both an
alternative to uh the the trumpian right and to the populist uh left but also in in kind of the
second portion or or you know in how the book opens as well in the introduction with all the
stuff about with the sort of quasi-futurist gloss they give to everything um you know that also kind
of seems to me or one way of reading it certainly is that uh you know that's an attempt to get you
know win back the sort of uh you know the silicon valley types who've who've kind of moved to the
right or who've moved from the democratic party to the republican party um you know it might have been
uh one of you who said this actually but that you know there's a sort of uh it's designed to capture
refugees from the effect of altruist movement um so i think yeah like as as you said matt like there's
it's there's not really a like a book except in this kind of meta sense that they've like
stitched all these disparate things together and i guess you know to their credit i'm sure
this will be a very successful airport book i think it's on the new york times bestseller list
um but it is not uh any kind of cohesive whole and it's not very intellectually coherent so you
really have no choice but to read around it uh and to read into the blank space and i really think
most of what's up for debate about this book has to do with just how how cynical do we ultimately
think they're being um i think there are certain places where uh the the book's omissions seem
so glaring that they have to be deliberate like they're there's a calculus to them that i think is
quite cynical um and there's other places i mean i'm genuinely puzzled by their attitude towards the
welfare state and i i am open to the idea uh you know that that that perhaps like they just they're
so immersed in sort of like centrist wonk discourse that they really think the welfare state is just
giving people money i don't know the uh one other thing i'd add here is um and this is uh i guess goes
to the sort of like reading uh through the blanks and the omissions and and like what what is what is
structuring this and what could be could be upsetting people about this because i saw this when i read all
the reviews that i could i read like 12 of them before i wrote my piece and you know i stumble
upon oh this this is like not just a book it's apparently a whole it's a whole thing with like
i mean literally oh i mean one of them i saw was over a hundred million uh open philanthropy which is a
like effective altruist kind of entity announcing a 120 million dollar abundance fund and there's like
five or six new ngos that have like abundance in their name and now i'm seeing like abundance
conferences i think there's an abundance conference in dc i got an email about recently it's a whole
thing like it's not just you know these two guys have kind of we're writing some articles that were
kind of similar overlapped in some ways and we're like why don't we do a book you know make some money
uh it's like this would be like this is a legit movement if you will i guess you would call like
an astroturf or capital g groups style movement but it's it's definitely a thing that's uh that's moving
and and they're trying to make an impact and jared polis is is is endorsing it and you know they're
they're they're racking up if you will kind of political wins in the way that like a think tank
or or other kind of ngo funded style like uh movement might be you know trying to to move and
operate through the system yeah i mean i guess i am i'm slightly curious about this i mean what does
an abundance ngo do right i mean like like well you fund white papers and conferences and you have
experts that can give quotes in media hits and will help because all remember no politician has
staff that can actually do anything you know i love their staff but like they're so overloaded
and they don't have any money so all that's outsourced you know i think about it from a think tank
perspective and the amount of like bills and whatever that i've had to help write and stuff over
the years like all that gets pushed out to someone or other who's you know and if you can get your money
lined up behind it you know it's it's it's how the the what do they say how the sausage is made kind
of kind of thing yeah so so much of it seems to be about uh crafting a lexicon crafting you know a
message box that uh i don't know democratic uh you know members of congress who want to align themselves
with the abundance agenda and perhaps it's about creating incentives for those reps to align themselves
with it as well but it's about crafting a message box for them to to use so you know people like
richie torres have started talking about the abundance agenda um so i guess he you know he has
a second interest now um beyond his his kind of his kind of main thing he focuses on um but uh there was
that interview before i'd read abundance you know there was that interview that as recline did
and it was transcribed in the new york times with that guy jake aussen sloss
um who's a congressman from massachusetts and uh i mean i guess i don't know what austin sloss is like
when he's going door knocking but it's pretty amazing if you read that interview which is the
most convoluted just soup of like just arbitrary like labyrinthine detail uh you know like but he's
but the point is he's learned all the you know he's he's he's already learned all of the terms and
there's an infrastructure now as as you were saying matt that like exists to uh train a congressman to
to talk that way uh it's nonetheless pretty funny to imagine trying to sell that political style as
any kind of popular agenda because you know he's saying stuff the whole time like oh we need an
economy of legos instead of an economy of monopolies and we you know uh like we should have an attention
tax which i read his about an attention tax which i is supposed to fund local journalism i read those
paragraphs like five times and i still have no idea what he's talking about i assume that's like a levy
on facebook or tick tock or something to fund press well you read it and see if you can figure it out
it's it's inscrutable yeah i mean so so i guess uh one thing that does strike me even about some of the
proposals and i i i do think like every sort of left or leftish critic i've seen of of this book
i mean you guys are like from the sort of anti-monopoly end of things like zephyr teach out or
whatever like like everybody at some point will sort of say yeah look a lot of these proposals are like
fine right like that that's that's uh and you know and and i can see that a lot of them are i you know
i do think maybe this touches on some of the question about redistribution because it does seem
like even some of the zoning reform stuff which is which is what people you know i i think will most
often sort of say yeah sure sure right gonna do that right uh like even some of that kind of feels
like oh you know uh maybe we can like let you know maybe it's like okay to like have you know we can
like restrict get rid of some of the restrictions on like building like apartments that like don't have
windows or air filters or stuff you know stuff and it's like um and and i think it's it's a small
example but it might say something about this sort of uh lack of interest in parceling out the present
or future because it's like well hold on is is that abundance i mean it's it's kind of like you're
you're saying like you uh i mean that that's actually like oh um they're like sort of individual
pieces we're parceling out to people are actually going to be smaller right but like you know don't
worry you know but like you're just going to make it easier to parcel out right i mean that that seems
very unabundant for the people at the bottom yeah i saw the have a really funny example of this
one of the things they fixate on the book is this housing development in san francisco i think it was
and they spent a lot of time on it and you know what was kind of clever about it or interesting
about it is it was very affordable or or you know the amount of money it took per unit was a lot lower
like i don't know 200 grand a unit or 300 or something it was a lot lower than normal and the
only way they were able to accomplish that was because they did all private money and they were they
did all these things to avoid the state being involved at all therefore not triggering all these
rules that you had to you know follow and forms and reviews and all this kind of stuff and i was
like okay that's a compelling example certainly of administrative burden okay yeah and it is kind of
sad that like you'd have to use all private money to do that like shouldn't the state you know be able
to be more efficient once it's involved because it's both the funder and the approver and all that
and then i went on twitter and i just saw someone share and they were like this is the thing they're
talking about and they showed it and it was like this the units were like look like prison cells they
were so tiny and they were like these studios i don't know it just was like it was like a micro
apartment you know and hey i'm not against it whatever you know but it's better than living on the
street and all that but it's like that's again like you said i was like does that is that abundance
is that i don't know it seems like uh these people are not getting a whole lot um well and also it's
it's a far cry from this from the actual portrait of abundance they offer the future yeah right because
they're talking about oh well there's all this new space for housing because we built these skyscraper
high like eggplant farms these greenhouses that reach up to the heavens and like uh we have orbital
platforms that are you know shipping free prescription drugs to people via drone all the
time and stuff like that and like yeah that is a pretty far cry from like single staircase apartment
buildings with like that lead to little microscopic like 250 square foot units like abundance is not
the term that i would i would use for that yeah i i mean even if you think like it's one thing to say
all right we're going to make like utilitarian calculation here that we can like build a bunch
of these like tiny cell apartments and like it'll it'll that'll still be better right you know than than
having less housing overall it's like okay fine right like i i i mean i honestly to me that kind of
seems like scarcity thinking it's like like like i think maybe we could like find ways to like build
things that are more livable than that but like uh but like whatever that's like an argument you could
have right but like sort of calling that abundance does maybe say something about the sort of core
conflation here that's like when you know that that you know as you said matt i mean like in your
your review i mean what they really seem to mean by abundance is you know is is uh you know growth
and innovation right uh that and you know that's like sure those are good things right i know you know
no denying that but like if you're going to have this this grand vision of you know like the the
implication of a lot of the way they talk about it seems like you know when we think about abundance
we're thinking about sort of like unleashed you know flourishing of uh of life and and you know i
and i think one you know maybe going back to you know this is uh this is something you hit on a lot
in your your review luke i mean like this is that um that it's like look sort of wanting a more
uninhibited flourish in a human life is precisely why the left has always cared about equality
yeah i in fact uh yeah i agree with that so hard i'm not sure i have anything to add there
well and and i also think it you know yeah i mean like you were saying with equality but you know
that that example is also such a beautiful you know uh link back to the whole issue with
distribution right because the case you would you make for those like micro apartments is you're like well
if you look at like the fifth percentile like it's either the for the fifth percentile as it
you know exists in our society what they are allotted their sort of aggregate resource allotment
like they're they're in a tent under the underpass or they could live here and you're like this is
definitely a huge improvement like don't get me wrong but that kind of gets to the point right which
is like if in the future the fifth percentile is still you know at 10 of the average it's gonna be
not abundant for them certainly it's gonna be gonna be kind of ugly uh uh for them so you know it
the fact that they never mentioned in the piece i guess in the book that uh that these are like little
micro apartments this is really really tickled me in retrospect it's just really undermines so much
whether it's the utopian vision whether it's a general sense of abundance whether it's about
the irrelevancy of redistribution like all that really it comes to the fore when you're like oh
you're just putting these people in little shoe boxes well and we'd be remiss to not bring in the
example that ryan grimm uh raised which you've probably both seen um you know in response to uh the
story that klein told in in a viral clip from john stewart's show where you know he's talking about the
biden administration you know passed this uh legislation to build rural broadband and you
know they spent all this money and it and nothing nothing happened and as ryan pointed out um what
actually happened is there were carve outs in the bill um and you know the people can easily find the
clip if if you want to uh get get the details but i'm you know i'm just kind of uh truncating it here
but i mean essentially uh you know companies like comcast big telecom monopolies got a bunch of
carve outs built into the bill because they didn't want to have to compete with public infrastructure
so what what they tell is this story of the scarcity mindset in action and of you know uh the cumbersome
bureaucratic uh administrative state you know just throwing money at the wall and nothing happening
um even to get something very basic done like build rural broadband it's just actually a very familiar
story of monopolism and corporate capture and i suspect that's true of a of a bunch of the anecdotes
uh and and case studies they provide in this book so you know this book is intellectually sloppy at
the sort of macro conceptual level for all the ways we've been saying but it also seems like they're
quite sloppy at the level of wonk detail which like if if ezra klein can't get that right that's
kind of supposed to be his yeah what's the point um yeah exactly no and i mean i think there's a
there's a there's a broader issue here right which is like okay so we've been talking about the
you know vision of the book and and what might be left out of that right you know but like there's
there's also the question of what they see as the obstacles to to that vision right you know so so i i
did see that ryan grim clip you're talking about luke uh and that's that's like a nice striking example
because it seems like you know i mean they i don't want to oversimplify like they they kind of name a few
villains you know over the course of the book but like you know one of the big villains they name
is like ralph nader that uh in this sort of really strange way because like you know usually if you
you know usually if you hear that guy's name invoked in a negative way people are talking about like the
2000 election uh and and like a lot a lot of liberals would be like yeah sure before that right
that's like uh the you know seatbelts airbags right you know it's like nader's great right uh
but uh but like the thing that they're mad about ralph nader for like is in fact all that stuff right
the the the sort of consumer you know consumer safety advocacy and lawsuits and all of that stuff
which which they take as sort of emblematic of um of the sort of liberal do-gooder obstacles to
you know abundant growth yeah i mean can can i just i just would like to table for discussion like
the paragraph here where they they offer sort of a backstory to this because it's not just ralph nader
i mean it's again they're very they're very evasive about what it is they're actually saying here and
and they seem to be saying simultaneously that there's a you know there's this nimbyist uh ethos
that sort of comes out of the the new left and it comes out of nader and and you know this kind of
uh yeah there's this individualist selfish ethos but then also there's this kind of uh centralizing
overly bureaucratizing one as well which there's to me there's a bit of a tension there but i mean
this backstory they provide i mean they're this is just this is pop sociology you know it's uh it's
like they're very they're very uh unclear and evasive about what it is they're actually saying
they say in the 1970s the new deal order collapsed beneath the weight of crises it could not contain
stagflation the vietnam war most notably but there was more to it than that abroad the horrors and
absurdities of communism became clearer at home millions of oppressed americans marched sat in and
organized for rights a change in values took hold the promise of collective action lost its lesser
lustre nurturing the dignity and genius of the individual in the face of regimes that seemed to
squelch both became the reigning ethos so uh that's how they're accounting for the decline of uh kind of
the you know more communitarian style of of liberalism and kind of the the fall of the new deal and uh the
great society um which there's all kinds of problems with with that because those things were
undone as part of a concerted political project right it's not like uh there wasn't just some
sort of like uh diaphanous spiritual transformation that happened where people became more uh you know
individualistic so again this just seems like a clear case of the book that like there's there's
no political economy in this book so it has to resort to stuff like this instead um but also yeah i
just i just i mean this is such a convoluted story they're telling here and again they're being very
evasive about uh who the actual uh like like who's actually responsible who who are the antagonists
of this project and i mean there's different ways of uh of reading that but i suppose one of them is
just centrist liberals have long had a kind of like reflexive aversion to the idea that there are
antagonists in politics right like they don't like politics to be structured around conflicts one of the
many things they disliked about bernie sanders so uh yeah i don't know a lot a lot could be said here
but it's just all all of this is very convoluted to me yeah and it's it's a weird paragraph too right
because the the one you started out with because it's pairing the sort of uh like you know like the
problems with you know soviet style communism and sort of you know people's reactions to that
with um it kind of sounded like the civil rights movement is like uh because like oh that was sort
of asserting rights against depression and like this this this all sort of leads to this individualist
ethos which is you know it just i mean maybe this is obvious but i mean it just seems like well there's
a lot that's been shoved together there i mean like if it's not uh like that like the actual civil
rights movement you know um like one of their you know one of their big demands was like government
job programs right like so that's that's not um you know the march on washington for jobs and freedom
right like that's um so it's it's it's like uh just sort of said oh yeah well people were concerned
about like their rights in this situation and you know they were concerned with people's rights in the
soviet union and that all kind of led to this ethos of individualism yeah i mean and i i this isn't
what i was getting at at this in this part of my review but there's you don't always you don't have
to do this historical attempt you know you really don't and i feel like maybe they felt like they had to
and then they were like oh my god what do we do you know it was it was some combination of ralph nader
and the consumer movement the environmentalist movement i think uh what was it silent stream
right yeah rachel carson rachel carson is that her name yeah um yeah she she was also did it the new
left did it um also but i think maybe just like rich societies get a little bit more like deliberate
in their decision making you know a little more you know people have more to lose things become more
developed externalities become more clear state capacity kind of develops more so it becomes a
little bit easier to kind of deliberate over these things i included in my review matto glacius theory
which is that you know because the left has become more kind of educated and more high-end than it used
to be um that they've taken on the attitudes of the english gentry and like that's the cause and like all
these are all efforts to point you know to try to somehow explain like this historical shift and
um to me i'm just like why even do that just just say look these rules are bad we're gonna fix them you
know uh otherwise because you just open yourself up to people like luke just being like what the what is
this this is so unclear i don't know what's going on you know and just being lampooned because
like if you were to try to actually answer this question you know as a historian right just i mean
years years of work presumably and then even then the book's probably like god i don't know you know
it's like it's 500 pages of a lot of hedging you know it it occurs to me like one way of reading this
book you could do a straussian reading right you could you could read this book as like they're writing
thompson and klein are writing esoterically so all of the kind of evasions and the blank space
is sort of deliberate and i mean if we if we consider again the passage that i just read
i mean if you changed a few of the words around in that passage if you you know they describe the
you know the the various like 1960s uh you know the movements for rights of various kinds i mean they
don't say it but when they say millions of oppressed americans marched and sat in etc i mean they're
talking about you know the anti-war movement they're talking about the feminist movement they're
talking about the civil rights movement and if you kind of like read between the lines a little bit
and we're being perhaps a tad ungenerous to them they are getting awfully close in that paragraph to
what has long been one of the the dominant right-wing narratives about the 1960s right which is that in
the 1960s a series of these kind of uh irrational enthusiasms among the liberal class feminism you
know uh black liberation civil rights uh etc etc you know that uh realizes itself by the 1970s by
interest groups making demands on the state making demands for resources that kind of thing and so that's
why we need you know uh neoliberalism that's why we have to dismantle the regulatory state uh and the
administrative state because otherwise we're just gonna have like a state that just funnels money
because it's been captured by all these different interest groups and we need a society of individuals
not groups etc etc i mean this is like getting close to something that jordan peterson uh could have
said if you read it a certain way which would be unfair to do if they were a little more precise but
they're so imprecise uh you know it's it's certainly tempting to uh to read it like that well i mean
i think that uh the you know certainly the thing that actually does feel and i think this is fair uh
jordan peterson asked is the sort of idea that it's like look what we should again you know what really
matters is is growth right you know uh not not the not the parceling right i mean this is like i think of
jordan peterson and in his uh uh uh in in his uh debate with the slavo zizek where he says you know
like sort of says the beginning hey i i you know flip through the communist manifesto and and i i saw
at the beginning that marx like admits that capitalism does a really good job of you know of of developing
you know the forces of society uh productive forces so so why not just keep with that right you know
like like like because because that's what that's what matters and and i mean i think a lot of the
discussion is has kind of floated around like okay they like some of the stuff we were talking
about earlier about that bizarre line about the nordics right it's it is almost like you know what
you often hear from from libertarians or conservatives where they're they just not really making a
distinction between like obamacare and universal public health insurance uh or you know whatever
i mean you know between uh between the the kinds of social benefits that you know that like you know
exist in a place like sweden and you know sort of means tested you know public assistance programs of
various kinds um and say yeah whatever it's it's all kind of the same thing now to be fair to them
the difference between them and people on the right who would do that are the people on the right would
be like yeah yeah that's all the same thing and it's like socialism and it's dangerous and it's bad
right whereas they're like yeah we've basically been doing all that and sure whatever that's good
right like that that's that's that's you know we're all for that whatever it's fine right but um
but you know then the whole thrust of the argument seems to be like systematically like de-emphasizing
that saying like like like yeah we've sort of like uh liberalism has suffered from from too great an
emphasis on on uh on on on redistribution which which again you know in the way a lot of luke's uh work
has uh uh you know over the years as as documented is is sort of very unlike how how how we tend to
perceive the last few decades of american liberalism but but i think it also gets back
to the question matt was raising a second ago right which is like okay why are we interested
in historical narrative in the first place because because sure i mean like if all you're doing is
sort of making policy proposals right you you you can't like leave out the historical narrative you
know it's like you know it's like okay whatever like regardless of how the problem arose here's the
problem and like here's the policy you know i think would would fix the problem
but like the one reason it might be important is if you think that like not just like oh in the past
this is how it's arose but like it might be relevant to your story about what kind of forces stand in
your way right now and and you know matt i i thought one of the most striking things in your review was
where you sort of said hey um it's really strange to read ezra klein sort of promoting you know what
he at least sees as this like you know very ambitious agenda there actually are ambitious things about
it i mean that there are things about what's been suggested that like you know uh that that there
would be a lot of resistance to right that um and you know and you're thinking back to this conversation
you have a client in like 2019 or something about uh about about medicare for all and in that
conversation like it seemed like his his big objection to medicare for all was that it's like
not politically practical because there'd be a lot of opposition yeah yeah yeah no um you know
because klein was a health care guy for so long um that's part of how he got to be such a big
player was during the obamacare debates and and all that so you know he knows a lot about health care
the health health insurance system without a doubt that was a great podcast i had with him but uh but
it was it was i didn't find it frustrating because i knew from the get-go that that's that was what was
going to be his move you know when you're dealing with other kinds of people on health care you don't
necessarily know like they might believe something like medicare for all will bankrupt america and
you'll have to like wait through like that it's like ezra's been doing this a long time he's smart
enough to know that like the move here is not medicare for all bad i can't do that certainly
they're probably not against matt um so we gotta go politics we gotta go politics and it's like all
right that's fine uh but yeah when i was reading the book i just remember that so much because i'm just
sitting here like oh man like the politics of this are rough like so your main if to the extent that
they identify a villain and and they are careful about just kind of being real wishy-washy about it
it's got to be the american homeowner the american homeowner has got to be the big main like uh person
who's holding back progress in the country like okay fine so let's let's look up them that's two
thirds of american adults disproportionately older disproportionately wealthier you know like as a
share of voters i don't even know i'm sure you could find this it's probably like 75 of voters or
something just because the way it's skews demographically um and so that's we got this
whole book and we're going to take on 75 of the pop of the voting population and strip them of all
this power they have to protect their assets and to determine you know what kinds of things exist
around them and you know affect their quality of life and and whatever and that's my policy thing and
i i'm just remembering back where he was when he asks me so what are you going to do about like
employer opposition to this and like well we're going to have to take them on and i'm like that's
like less than one percent of the population you know it's like an employer like theoretically yes i
think a mass movement could take on a small percentage of the population that employees people as like a
business owner or whatever um and you're wanting to take on like the bed all the whole voting populace
essentially uh it just seems at odds you know but i think it you know i don't know i don't know how
much you want to read into it but it's just people are very selective and they tend to be very blind you
know they see the political obstacles of things they don't really care that much about and they if they're
really interested in it they're maybe less prone to see the politics of it you know like the political
practicality argument is very selectively applied and and certainly in this case you you see this in
all kinds of debates today and not just uh not about not just about social programs and redistribution
because there is like on the one hand we're constantly confronted in political discourse with the
assertion that essentially nothing is possible like the united states which is the richest
you know society in the history of civilization cannot realize you know universal health insurance
even though canada where i live has had it since the 1960s and is a much poorer country you know
um so we're told like nothing is possible in you know the public sphere um programs that
quite literally exist in the world they have been realized united states cannot american politics cannot
achieve those things but then in the private sphere right uh particularly out of silicon valley
uh we're constantly told that uh we're gonna have like sentient computers that are gonna do
everything very soon uh elon musk has been claiming for like nigh on two decades now that he's going to
like establish a martian colony and he's always like two or three years away from launching the project
uh you know there's so many there's so many things like this uh or you know i think back to one of the
democratic debates in 2020 when you know biden i i think uh could be misremembering but i think right
after dismissing medicare for all is improbable he just said well you know uh i'm gonna find a cure for
cancer in my first term you know so we're like you know i think that's that's operating uh here as well
like there's this kind of uh this this this this dissonance for yeah like as you said matt like certain
certain things based on people's subjective preferences are just deemed or or in some cases
like who's bankrolling them or other more material factors like that like uh people are very selective
about what they decide is intractable political opposition or not and i mean i think the point
you just made about you know they're taking on the american homeowner with this agenda is is worth
considering because i they might even be aware of that but i don't think you know i don't get the sense
when you read the sections of this book that gesture at the idea that this is going to be a
political agenda that they really care about that sort of opposition i think uh you know i don't know
i'm not as familiar with derek thompson's work but i it seems to me as recline is someone who largely
well i mean it kind of considers politics as you know to be an elite concern and he imagines this is
something that's played out uh in kind of elite think tanks and and in in kind of other elite spaces
and so if you're taking on 75 percent of the electorate you know that's not a problem but
taking on you know the health insurance industry uh is because that's those aren't the kinds of people
you go up against i mean they do quote this political scientist uh is it gary gary gursel who
talks about how uh you know the things you need for a successful uh you know a successful agenda is um
you need it you need to make advances across a broad front you need deep pocketed donors think
tanks policy networks candidates and inspiring moral message um and they they you know they mention uh
both reagan and fdr as kind of examples of doing this but there's nothing about you know you need a
mass movement you need to mobilize people you need to uh you you need to uh organize popular pressure to
exert uh you know to make demands on political institutions or anything like that um so yeah
once again i think there's a lot that one can kind of learn about the world view of this book just from
looking at the the blank space and the things that they don't address yeah they definitely do have a
like uh grass tops uh uh theory of change uh which i mean if you've been in dc your whole life i'm sure
that's what you think of it but yeah i guess you're that is a very good point when he when he said how
do you overcome the employers he really meant the chamber of commerce and the you know various like
lobbying organizations and i don't know that is there a homeowner version of that i have no i'd probably
not you know it's like those are just people but i'm talking about the institutions that determine
uh you know what policy is viable or not um that's a funny and the utopian thing is is um i i you know
i don't know why i thought of this just now but there's a um one of the things i really like about
the early socialists is they really do this thing where they're like one of their arguments against
clearly like they're dealing with people who are saying you can't do this you can't achieve socialism
and one of the things they'll point to is like scientific progress and they'll be like if we can
do this yeah this is nothing you know and it's funny because they're writing like 18 you know 30 or
whatever and so what they think of is like scientific progress is like it's impressive don't get me wrong
but like you know there's no like uh well if we can land a man on the moon then we yeah it's so much
lower to your stuff but they're obviously it's very impressive to them in that moment
and i think about this in the context of this book where it's like okay so you know and and then that
discussion with ezra it's like so ezra is like we can have orbital pharmacies that shoot like zimpic
down to homes but if you're like can we get everyone on a single public health insurance plan he's like
absolutely not it's like a full inversion and you can you know it's like wait a minute surely if we can
have orbital pharmacies which is a medical thing we can make sure everyone like has health insurance
right it's like no it's too much um but yeah it does go to show you it's sort of like but i mean
that gets to the point of like i don't know like how much is technology the thing that holds us back
and growth the thing that holds us back it's uh it's this other constellation of things that you
know ideology philosophies um you know like like again the parceling out does seem very relevant like
i think like there's this thing that was going around a few weeks ago about like bill gates saying
that by whatever year in the future we won't need humans to do most things and then he was like oh so
we'll have like therefore we'll have a 25-hour work week it's like well that's a really weird
therefore because like work week hasn't gone down since the fair labor standards act in 1938 and there's
been a lot of technological progress since 1938 right that's clearly not the holdup um but i i really like
your point about about strategy and and the contrast to employer opposition uh to medicare for all and and
uh you know homeowner opposition to a lot of the sort of you know ymbia stuff that uh that that they're
focused on big you know because you know in a way i mean it's it's like okay look i don't want to i
certainly don't want to like understate how hard it is to to overcome you know uh employer opposition
because it's you know one might be one percent of the population but it's like uh you know one percent of
the population with like an enormous amount of political power but like also if you're going to
have ambitious goals that require you to overcome that you know all sorts of vested political opposition
uh then it seems like you you need to be able to have a you know popular movement that can can gain you
know um majority support right i mean like as as kind of the as kind of the baseline you know in uh
you know in a democracy uh or or at the very least if that's not part of the plan right like like like
i want to know what the plan b is and and and so like in a certain sense and it sort of reminds me of
like the you know adolf reid argument about uh reparations where it'll be like okay you know it's
like uh if we're just doing a normative thing you know would be nice to have reparations sure
right but like if um but like if you're trying to achieve any sort of you know major redistribution of
wealth right like then you have to overcome all those vested interests you're gonna be able to
do that much more easily if you're doing it in a way that's going to benefit you know um a majority
of the population right you know rather than only benefiting a you know minority of the population
and the problem with like homeowner opposition to zoning reform or to like you know even stuff that's
like i mean i i think like even the sort of most unambiguously positive uh aspects of of the
abundance agenda like i love high-speed rail all over the place that'd be amazing right uh that um
they like it you have to be able to do it in a way presumably that would clearly benefit right the uh the
majority of the population and so there's a there's a line mat in your your review where you're sort of
spelling out kind of some of what you were saying earlier right you say you know uh that many of
the anxieties that stoke opposition to the kinds of construction projects and rapid technological
innovations favored by the author downstream of economic inegalitarianism people block housing
construction because they fear living next to the people that our economic system uh provides so little
income to they uh block nearby transportation and energy infrastructure because they don't want to
tumble down the economic ladder by impairing the value of their personal real estate assets they
resist productivity enhancing technology because they fear job loss and permanent income loss the uh
reservation or deepening of economic inegalitarianism could easily turn the author's utopian vision of 2050
into a dystopian nightmare but like even before that last line i mean what what i like about this
is that it seems at least somewhat suggestive to me that it's like okay like let's let's just say you
know i mean i i kind of mentioned some reservations that i have about some of the zoning stuff they're
they're into earlier but it's like put all that aside right like let's just assume that like a sort of
hundred percent of the making construction easier uh you know nurturing scientific innovation you know making big
you know sort of public construction product all that stuff right all that stuff they're talking
about it that like let's assume for the sake of argument that a hundred percent of that is like
benevolent and desirable and stuff we want to happen right so then you know we could sort of say all
right we have you know we have two goals at least right you know uh that you know we want to do
we want to do redistribution you know we want to have a more economically equal society and we also want to
want to do all their stuff and it seems like that passage that i just read from your review is suggestive
of a strategic argument that if anything the order of operations might have to be create a more equal
society first so that you eliminate a lot of the incentives that people have to block the stuff that
they want right yeah yeah no yeah that that move was designed as a you know to couple with the other
move that you know hey distribution is important not just because it parcels the present but because
it will parcel your future um but then secondarily you know you can't put it to the side because
these two things actually relate uh interact with one another they're not separate we just produce
produce produce and we don't tend to distribution um you know we would call this political economy
and in other contexts right you have to think about wait how do our economic proposals
generate the political feedback that you know creates and reproduces the system and you know
how is that all going to go um in fact if they start from there they might understand that mark's
uh quote a little bit better because he's also speaking of political economy in part there um
but yes i mean we have the political economy of if you create a really unequal society people become
afraid of change and i actually subsequently i did a calculation let me see if i can pull it up that i
that i posted on twitter that was actually about this but i kind of just um i kind of just tossed it
off and didn't go anywhere with it um but let's see yes per capita distribution um basically yeah here we go
um so what i wanted to do not to make this a math thing is i wanted to see okay if there would be a
way to demonstrate why people might be afraid of technological innovation if we assume that if you
insert new technology it's going to be disruptive in a way that some people are going to lose their job
and they'll get reallocated into a different job but like some people are definitely going to kind of
fall down the ladder a little bit right like i used to have this job and then it new tech kind
of made it redundant and so now i had to go to do this other job but this new the old job was like
a 70th percentile job and this is more like a 60th percentile job and whatever like that's the kind
of thing that happens when you introduce uh new technology and so how much income would you stand to
lose if you were to drop just 10 percentiles in the income distribution so imagine you're at the 60th
percentile and some shock occurs you don't lose everything but you know your job is gone you got
to get re-employed and so you go down to the 50th and if you were to do just that go from the 60th to
the 50th your income would decline 20 and that's true kind of like across the board as you get towards
the tails the percentages go way up well like basically 25 to 30 that's how much you're standing
to lose if you just fall 10 points in the distribution and so what are we looking at when
we're thinking about explosive growth well you know we get kind of like two percent a year of growth
you know for doing doing pretty good so let's say you could increase up to three percent a year which
is like a 50 percent increase of quite a radical change well you know it's going to take you for
that extra percent would take you like 18 years to make up for the fact that you tumbled just 10 points
in the distribution so like of course you're telling me hey man in 18 years you could be as well off as
you were like that's not going to go but think about this again mathematically if you squeeze the
differences between the percentiles so that it's not the case that you lose 20 percent of your income
if you tumble 10 points but you just lose like a two percent or three percent well now the calculus
changes and you're much more now you're much more invested in what is the average income of the society
right so a more kind of less mathy way to put it is the more unequal the society is the more you
rationally are invested in holding on to your spot
because you don't want to fall whereas the more equal the society is the more rational it is for
you to think about what is the best way to maximize the average outcome because you're much closer
to the averaging outcome and the average outcome is going to be much more important to you than
whether you're at the 40th percentile or the 60th percentile this is what you see in the nordic
countries as well is that their wage distribution is hugely compressed like the gap between the 90th and
10th percentile is so much smaller than it is here just like in the wage distribution so
in a way like who cares if i lose my job because i'll get on good unemployment benefits i'll get
another job and guess what it's basically going to pay the same thing that i was already making because
all the jobs kind of pay the same you know especially when you add in that a good chunk of
your income is not even coming from your job it's coming from the free health care it's coming from the
free child care it's coming from the free college it's coming from the child allowance it's coming
from all these social benefits anyways so it's you know once everything is kind of all the same
you're invested in wanting to improve average outcomes and so you know it's a long way around
of saying that inequality makes people afraid of change because change could mean that you go down
the ladder and when the gaps in the ladder are big that's a very scary proposition and the other thing
is on the flip side you know i use the example of elon musk right uh musk was made rich by exactly the
kind of things that they want to promote in the on the innovation part of the book right let's subsidize
these growth industries uh uh electric vehicles solar panels uh he's got his satellite spacex right and
they made him the richest man in the world doing doing all that through government uh programs and then
he's you know he's got he he accumulated so much power through that wealth that he essentially became
like a shadow president who is in the process of like destroying state capacity and cutting the kind
of things that they actually like you know like national institutes of health grants they're kind of
destroying academic research and stim yeah i mean like i i i mean i'm not even particularly in a world where
i know a lot of these people but even i like you know well like know people or know people know
people and hear all this stuff and i was like oh this or that person is like a scientist and they're
like oh should i get a job in another country now because like all this stuff is uh is going away uh yeah
right so i'm really glad you brought up elon musk because this kind of gets into like the last
you know thing that i i really wanted to take you guys brain about which is that like
the you know luke sort of alluded to this earlier right like that the the context of the book that
you know maybe when they were first starting to write it they assumed that you know we'd be under
our due to you know democratic administration but you know um it's like as it is now it is this part
it is kind of this intervention in debates about you know what sort of i mean you know some of us would
like something better than liberalism but whatever right you know like let's just say to use their
framing right what sort of liberalism you know should should be sort of counterposed to trumpism
if like the you know if if you know progressives democrats whatever like are gonna like get their
groove back and like take take take power again uh and you know one of the things luke that i i i think
you like kind of brought out nicely in any review is is like look so much of this stuff seems like a
really like sort of small bore concern that it's like you know that's like a lot of what's driving
this is yeah some of these like big blue cities are are run terribly right which look i live in los
angeles nobody needs to convince me that that premise is true right like that's clearly true right that they
have a that they're like all sorts of horrible and dysfunctional things about the way that la for
example is is run but like sort of treating that as as this as this grand like utopian like thing
that it's like oh this is the this is the key that we need to unlock to like get everything it's like
well i don't know man it's like there are a lot of cities in the u.s that aren't actually run by by
democrats there there are a lot of you know uh or certainly at least like you know that have um you
know like you know big cities in texas you know that like like like have um that have like a zoning
regime that like actually doesn't seem far off from from what they want right like and and that's
that that's kind of not that inspiring a vision right that like we'll we'll sort of implement that
you know implement that nationally and then also related to this right and it's like look uh like
they actually say both of you guys quote this in your reviews right uh there's this line i understand
it's not the only thing they say about musk it is also a more negative thing later but they say uh
musk has become a lightning rod in debates over whether technological progress comes from public
policy or private ingenuity um but he is a walking advertisement for what public will and private
genius can unlock when they put together i mean luke do you think do you think musk is a uh is a
compelling advertisement for that well as i mean as matt just said um you know he's he's he's an
advertisement for the the exact opposite i mean he's an advertisement for the dangers of pursuing
precisely this approach um and it's very funny because this has been said already i mean this is
already the approach that so many of america's political leaders have taken it's like yeah let's just
subsidize these like you know mercurial uh tech barons and that's how uh you know that's how
innovation happens that's how we get you know that is the font of social and economic progress
and you know that's i think that's absurd and actually to tie together this and and and the the
prior uh conversation i mean i think this relates back to the the bigger point here about redistribution
i mean it seems to me that like if we want to adopt uh you know at least in the abstract the
thrust of of you know the the conceptual thrust of the abundance agenda and say okay well yeah sure
we agree we want we want abundance you know fostering innovation is the most important thing you
know this is kind of what the second half of the book is about uh i i again think that uh having
a more egalitarian society is uh is one of the ways you can do that right because it seems to me
people are a lot less likely to be creative and to innovate and to be disposed of the kinds of
things that are precursors to creativity and innovation if they're suffering you know if
they're spending 12 hours a day in shitty alienating jobs or if they're having to spend most of their
mental and emotional and psychological bandwidth uh just earning the bare necessities
of life you know it seems to me that uh the context in which people flourish uh you know in
bra in a broad sense is is one where they it's more likely to be one where people have to worry
less about those kinds of things um and so again i i feel like there's you know there's there's an
argument here that the the sort of you know the current the current regime um you know in the current
approach to innovation that this book embraces which you know is the current one basically um
that's what's hampering innovation you know in a in a in a big way i mean although i guess just to
to make a further point and sorry matt and then i'll you could come in but to make a further point
i guess i also think it's maybe just a mistake to construe innovation is something that you can
sort of like there's like a perfect regulatory framework uh perfect incentive structures to have
maximum innovation i think it's a much more you know particularly when it comes to scientific
discovery it's a much more like nebulous process i don't think it's as easily quantifiable and like
that's why we've seen technological innovations come out of all kinds of different contexts and
there's a lot of luck involved and you know it's it's just it's it's it's not something that you can
like wonk your way into i don't think yeah i i a hundred percent agree with that um and i think i may
have made that point on the choppo podcast when i was on it but i think the because that's a huge
question that comes up in a lot of policy i remember for many years i was having to fight this argument
where people would say well the the nordic countries they sure are equal but they're not innovative and i
wrote so much stuff on it and as part of that you actually you know you're kind of forced to ask the
question so what causes innovation what and then you start looking and it's like oh man they kind of it
kind of just comes you know this sort of lightning bolt and you got to be able to capture and innovate
it and or capture it and implement it that is something that is institutionally important but
um where it comes i mean i think about like finland you know because that would be one of
the countries and it's like well what is this what is something finland contributed they finn
it they contributed the linux operating system which is just this guy linus torvalds whose dad by the
the way is a communist um and um i don't know like he's just a guy he was like a coder he was at the
university of helsinki he made this thing it kind of took off and now like the vast majority of computers
in the world are run on it and including i'm sure this server that we're on right now and you know it's
like that's did that come because anything finland did i i don't know um but i but i do think there
are definitely some like intuitive things that you can look at where you can start thinking about
it's at least plausible that inequality in our country might push against innovation um for the
reasons you gave luke but also for reasons related to just horrible allocation of talent like if you
think one of the things that drives innovation is there are some people who are kind of smart kind of
like tinkery kind of interested you know who in that where do we put those people they go and they
go work at mckenzie right exactly no the the the smartest kid i knew in high school i went to a huge
high school at 4 000 kids in north texas and um he like won every science competition there's like state
science competitions he whatever like he went to an ivy league school he was like really really smart
clever guy i met up with him a few years after i don't know maybe five six years later and i was
like what are you up to and he worked on wall street of course but what did he do and he was like so i
follow the monster energy stock and like we trade we trade like on monster energy stock movements i'm
like oh that's good all right but like when in high school he's like i'm gonna do physics i'm like he was
this all into that stuff and i'm like that guy probably could have come up with something or
people like him in aggregate may have come up with something and now he's sitting there writing reports
on the price movement of monster energy securities it's like that's that can't be good for innovation
let me let me just say one more thing here to add to that because yeah like insofar as i can envision
any kind of institutional institutionally specific way to to foster innovation like it seems to me that
uh again like the the the silicon valley model for you know technological and scientific progress
for invention where it's like okay we're gonna have this really really high risk environment where
huge amounts of capital are are are wasted on you know you name it you know we work
cryptocurrency uh juicer juicero like all these kind of things but then for every like 100 of those
we're gonna get you know probably not even an iphone but i don't know some consumer product that
people actually uh people actually like it seems to me that uh a lot of the most important innovations
that have happened uh at least you know since the you know the 20th century have come out of public
and you know public investment or or you know public universities or or uh publicly subsidized scientific
research and i think one of the reasons for that is because uh that type of research that type of
scientific inquiry uh it's not really happening in a competitive environment in the same way right if
you if you are a brilliant scientist say and you work or you know a a brilliant guy who works who watches
the monster energy stock you know if you are working for a private company that company has a a market
incentive not to share information not to share expertise that kind of thing because they're they're
they're trying to compete um you know and that's like you know you see that with like pharmaceutical
companies all the time right um that's that's just one example uh when you're doing public research
there's also like uh you know it's also harder to do i think certain kinds of basic research you know
that like might or might not bear any kind of useful fruit anytime soon right i mean like you even
you know you even mentioned like when you were sort of trying to give the dude you know private
innovation you even mentioned the iphone it's like when people watch the show seem to say this many
times but it's like the uh it's all public all the technologies came out of public research yeah the
only you know i mean the only ted talk ever tell people to watch is the mariana mazucato one where she's
talking about like how like everything in this thing that like actually makes a smartphone instead of a
dumb phone you know came from like the defense department or public universities or you know
whatever right like uh and you know i i don't want to overstate what you can learn from that because
like i i do agree with you that i mean like the the you know like sort of trying to figure out exactly
what the causes of innovation you know innovation are is is hard but i mean like it does seem at least
suggestive that like the secret sauce is not having a private company do it i did i there was uh it is
important to note for in fairness to the authors that uh uh and i think this was derek's part of
the book at this at the end of this part of the book he does on some level kind of acknowledge that
he doesn't they don't really know and then but says like we can fund a meta science to figure it out
right oh so if we do but then i thought oh my god we're gonna have so many debates about which
scientists to fund to do the meta science and should it be early career ones and what should
the regulatory we're just recreating this problem this is a return to like the most ridiculous tendencies
of like the of like the enlightenment like i think it was it was francis bacon who started writing this
text called the novum organum where the point of it was just it was going to be a perfectly like
streamlined rationalized method for every form of inquiry so whatever your question was this was
going to be like you know like this kind of almost i guess metaphysically or rationally grounded way of
like doing all forms of inquiry no matter like what they what they were so this is like a menu that
any person could use regardless of their level of expertise to find the truth about something and
this didn't just apply to science it applied to like philosophical and moral inquiries uh as well
and so when you i'd forgotten about that passage but it's really fascinating like there there's this
concession that like yeah we don't know how innovation happens but then they think that
that problem itself is one that you can like technocratically resolve it's like well we're
gonna have a meta science like because fundamentally everything is just a puzzle and if you apply enough
wonk expertise you can solve every problem and it's like can we just give poor people money and
have universal social programs instead like what are we doing here yeah i mean and again i i think
that they you know the point maybe like kind of the critique of of the whole thing that i find the
most you know compelling because uh you know and i don't with the stuff we've been talking about for
the last few minutes i don't want to give anybody the wrong impression right like i don't want to talk
about these guys like they're libertarians like they do want you know like stay involved in a lot of
this stuff although there's some ambiguity but um but you know is is just that it's like look the idea
that we should like focus on you know innovation and growth and making it easier to do ambitious
strong you know uh construction progress and you know technological change and maybe like de-emphasize
this redistributive you know redistributive stuff that you know the liberals been far too concerned about
because you know bernie sanders has been running the democratic party for the last you know 40 years
right uh that uh we you know we and we should de-emphasize a lot of this stuff it's like beyond
the sort of normative critique of it that that i think is like correct like i do actually think
equality matters in and of itself but like you know is just like yeah look uh the the um you know the two
you know this the sort of point matt was making like it's like look the two can't be the two can't
be separated that uh you know that they you know you have on the one hand uh by how you know like by
creating a very unequal society you know you give people lots of rational incentives to resist a lot of
this stuff uh and and by just sort of focusing on like funneling state support into anything that looks
innovation uh uh without worrying about the distribution right you know you make elon musk
the richest man in the world and then he like dismantles all the parts of the state that uh
ezra klein and derek thompson you know um care the most about right you know which is like
seems really suggestive to me that like uh that that this is this is not you know that like the sort of
like innovation and construction first approach right is is not going to be you know long-term
viable uh even on its own terms but i think we can keep going forever but uh you guys both been
really generous with your time uh matt luke thank you guys so much uh uh luke where uh where can people
find your stuff well i got on substack recently uh along with you know uh lots of writers i'm sure your
