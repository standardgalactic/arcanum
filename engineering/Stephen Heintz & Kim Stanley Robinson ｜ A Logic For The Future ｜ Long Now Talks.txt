good evening and welcome to the long now foundation my name is patrick dowd and i'm
board president here at the long now foundation i'm very excited to introduce our speakers for
this evening public policy expert stephen heinz president of the rockefeller brothers fund and
science fiction author and long time long now member kim stanley robinson stephen and stan are
going to be speaking this evening about a logic for the future of international governance but
the conversation as you'll see and i hope your questions will guide is really about imagination
how can we imagine a better world and make it possible through new forms of governance
stephen and stan welcome to the stage
stan stephen welcome to the long now foundation how does it feel to be back and be here for the first
time nice to be back hometown sort of i'm from the provinces of my hometown so i love it more than
even the people here
and for me it's a great a great pleasure and um and a great honor and thank you all for coming
this is great and i have to say it's a particular honor to be here with stan somebody i admire and
respect so profoundly so it's really a delight tonight is going to be a journey of imagination
and we're going to start far out looking on a planetary even multi-planetary level and come
in closer towards the national and international into the local in this moment where we are now
and then we're going to zoom back out further and further so beginning at this level of the planetary
stan you explored this both in the mars trilogy and ministry for the future
steven you've looked at global governance futures through a planetary lens could you share with us how
how is it that you came to have the imagination that you did for these possible futures and what are
you finding in the real world well i am a science fiction writer and when i began the viking missions
and voyager were going out in the 70s and the viking gave us mars in a way it never existed before
except for mariner a little bit and then voyager showed us the rest of the solar system in ways we'd
never seen before and so for a young science fiction writer it was about planets and science fiction is
the literature where you can actually use the word planet without boggling people's minds it's really
one of the topics that what science fiction is about the the planetary romance you go to another planet
it's new it's interesting it's exotic it's hiding jack vance or frank herbert or ursula leguyen these the
planetary romance was big and so i naturally got an interest in mars because it had just been handed
to us on a platter millions of times more information about that planet than we had had before and
nobody had written it up yet so that was an obvious project that took a long a big chunk of my life and
then the other bodies in the solar system equally beautiful and interesting so it was a kind of a story
space i guess you would say then you look back at earth and a it's the greatest planet for human
beings duh having evolved here co-evolved with it and rather remarkable in the sweet slot and the golden
zone of liquid water etc etc look at it and it it's obvious from that perspective which is an excellent
perspective it's one space it's one biosphere it's one species it ought to be governed as such if we
want to be in a good relationship with the rest of the biosphere very obvious very not the case
so there's more stories to be told and stephen how did you come to the planetary as a frame for
governance features well uh i would say it's largely through uh the study of history and the study of
political history in particular international relations and the recognition that in the 21st
century increasingly we are living in an age of enormous turbulence that is unprecedented we all think
well history is always about turbulence you know it's wars it's plagues it's you know
catastrophe and that's true but we are living in a period when there are multiple sources of
turbulence causing multiple planetary consequences and the risks of three simultaneous existential threats
the climate crisis obviously but a new nuclear arms race which is beginning and also the advent of
technologies that we can't really yet imagine how they will be managed so that we get maximum benefit and
avoid potential deep risk and so we're at an inflection point in planetary survival and unless we start
thinking at the planetary level and adjust our current systems to that frame of reference we might experience
not just the age of turbulence but the age of catastrophe and in this planetary frame
stan you're approaching it through the lens of science fiction based on deep research into the
current realities and future possibilities of technology and governance while being in dialogue with
people who are leading and shaping governance systems around the world and steven you are
in that milieu of the governance systems and academia and philanthropy and think tank world and you're getting
inspiration from the fictional genre so could you both speak about how in terms of cultivating imagination
about what can be possible in the future you're both inspired by both fiction and non-fiction
well for me if you're going to tell a story of the future you've left the realm of realism and there's
reason for the readers to question everything you say why this is kind of a fantasy the sets seem to be cardboard like
the star trek bridge trying to make it more real than realism has been an aesthetic goal so then you have to
learn some stuff to make your story feel solid in the reader's mind so then very quickly you come to this
realization that the nation state system is a historical artifact that is not fit for purpose for planetary
governance this is a zero-sum game and really a cause of enormous misunderstandings and strife and then
uh given my background it becomes equally obvious that capitalism as practiced is a kind of predatory
parasitic uh social system that creates inequality creates environmental destruction as a part of its
system in san francisco you get applause for that line you gotta go and thank god thank god for that so this
is what i'm interested in stephen is that you have actually been there and seen the nation state
systems trying to get along like with the nuclear deal with iran and um the the the sheer awkwardness
and badness the the potential for misunderstanding conflict and but you have seen a role for yourself and for
your organization like yours to serve as a kind of a clutch between an engine and a motor or some
lubricant to make the gears work better and not just freeze up you've had experiences that few people have
had of that kind and i'm interested to hear more the iran deal yeah well that's a thank you stan
it's a very interesting case study um and it's a it's kind of a long story which i'm going to really
work hard to truncate but after 9 11 literally as i had an office on madison avenue that looked straight
down to the twin towers and the next morning uh i showed up for work and the towers were no longer
there and the smoke was rising from the site and like everybody we began to ask questions about why did
this happen what is it telling us what do we need to think differently and everybody was focused on
the arab world because of course the terrorists who who conducted that terrible event were sunni arabs
and i kept looking at the map and i said yes i understand that and that's obviously something we
need people need to work on need to understand need to figure out but then i kept saying but you know
iran which is a shia muslim country is a geo strategically located very large and totally
not understood by americans because we have not had any diplomatic relations with them since the 1979
revolution and they i had this feeling that iran was going to loom very large in the coming years
and so i just started talking to people about this i didn't know anything about iran either
um and through the kind of networking that people in my profession are very privileged to be able to do
i was introduced to iran's ambassador at the united nations and we started having this conversation
and he said you know we need to find a way for americans and iranians to actually talk to each other
about the issues that divide us because otherwise we are headed into some kind of collision course
and so we organize what is known in the field as a track two diplomatic effort so non-official but
with people who are serious practitioners of diplomacy the u.s team that we assembled were all
former american diplomats highly distinguished and regarded diplomats who had served in both republican
and democratic administrations some for their entire careers and at very high levels including
a former ambassador of the un etc and the iranians ultimately also brought together a team and it
was very complicated as you can imagine just getting started the point i think you're asking me to address
is that the governments couldn't do this because of the zero-sum logic that pervaded international
relations and the fact that the 1979 revolution happened we had the hostage crisis we carried that grievance
deeply in the american psyche they had the assassination or the overthrow rather of mosaddegh the
democratically elected prime minister of iran in 1953 because he nationalized the oil industry
they carry that grievance deeply in their psyche and there was no possible way for the two governments
to talk to each other in fact they were american diplomats this is how stupid it gets american diplomats if
they went to an embassy reception at the united nations they were not allowed to even
greet the iranian diplomats in the room so we became the alternative uh and it was it was a very very
difficult process it's still ongoing uh in this moment but we did to your point have once we started
building trust between these two teams and we met dozens and dozens of times in the woods outside of
stockholm because we were then able once we had the level of trust to start putting ideas on the table
well how could we solve this nuclear problem what what are things that might work what what are things
that might be acceptable to your side and the other side and then we would go back to our capitals we
would go to the white house we would go to the state department and we would you know describe
what we were learning and they would give us their perceptions so we'd go back and meet six weeks later
and this was an iterative process that ultimately generated ideas that helped and i don't want to
overstate the case but john kerry would say if you were here and even president obama that this helped
create the possibility for the two governments to actually begin to negotiate directly and then when
they started the negotiations we were a place that was able to keep transmitting ideas into the formal the
track one negotiations from this track two process so it is a good example of how civil society
organizations of which we are one at the rockefeller brothers fund working with other civil society
organizations can actually be a kind of constructive intermediary in solving
planetary significant problems like the iran nuclear question both in ministry for the future
and in your monograph stephen a logic for the future you imagine a world in which things work out
for planetary governance and i want to invite you to share that with our audience perhaps people who
might not have already read either of your works what does it look like things working out over what kind
of time frame what are some of the elements of a planetary program that could get us from where we are to
a more sustainable future well i define myself as a utopian science fiction writer so that is a
unusual and interesting and new stories come out of it the the i've said this before perhaps on this very
stage the utopias are like blueprints and novels are like soap operas and so combining blueprints and soap
operas is not automatically a key to aesthetic success but we have ursula k leguin and the dispossessed as
an example of how it can be done and i've always held that up to myself if it can be done once it uh it
could be done again the the to the human story of trying to make a better world as long as you don't think
of utopia as an end case then but rather as a process a name for positive history that's utopian
then a you've got stories you've got to create it you've got to protect it after and and keep it good
after it's been established in fact i would like to quote the greatest american utopian science fiction
story ever written as a example of how it works the government of the people by the people and for the
people shall not perish from the earth this is in the future tense the future imperative it's an
injunction we are required to do it we are enjoined to do it it's a almost a legal term shall not and that
is a utopian story that we have to keep keeping alive so stories are there it was it was a mistake
to think that it was utopias and or blueprints and soap operas it was actually a matter of writing about
history and then just i will just finish by saying for our moment in history avoiding a mass extinction
event is a utopian science fiction story because we are so scarily close and we've begun it it'll be
hard to pull out of it it takes it's going to take a lot of international cooperation of the kind
you're describing to make it work and so now with the bar that low all kinds of fictions that are
interesting could be called utopian science fiction and so i'm thinking now here of the scale in your
logic four um there's scale up and and then scale in and i'll i'll mention them but you'll have to talk
about them one at a time maybe the scaling up for national sovereignty this the zero-sum game
that's wrecking things you mentioned the eu as the most important development of the second half of
the 20th century and i already had been taught that by my beloved and late teacher frederick jameson
to go from nation state to member state is crucial um legally financially and psychologically so that's
the scale up and then the scale down would i want to talk later about human sovereignty as a phrase and
an idea but tell tell us more about why you describe the eu that way you know what can i just say as i as
i get ready to answer that question that i i think in this conversation about the importance of imagination
patrick which you started this with and i i remember andrew wyeth saying about his paintings that
that they were dreaming in the presence of reality and i think that's what your novels do you are dreaming
about a future based on science of today and science that people are developing so it is a it is a dream
based on scientific realities and my own work in this regard is about dreaming of a better system for
this century not as far into the future perhaps as some of the work that you've done also in the
presence of the realities of international relations and history and politics so when we think about
people who had dreams the founders of the european union were doing exactly that they were dreaming in
the presence of the reality of the end of the second world war on a continent where they had fought two
world wars back to back basically largely you know between france and germany and the the dreamers
who created the european union decided they had they had to create they had to invent something that
would prevent that from ever happening again and they started out small with something called the european
coal and steel community to create a common market for those products and from there they kept building
and building and building and building out to create a peace project essentially we think of the european
union as a as a political entity as a market as a you know a very very important uh economy in the world
now more or less equivalent in gdp to the u.s economy but it was a peace project and it has worked really well
ever since it was founded but the real lesson in this is that 27 european countries have given up some
of their sovereignties because they see the benefit of pooling that sovereignty expanding the zone
and working on environmental economic political social and now security problems collectively as
opposed to trying to do it individually and to me this is probably the most successful political
development of the 20th century certainly the second half and it is a model for the future it has
its flaws and they know it the europeans know it and they're trying to work through those flaws
they have the same problem that we have in this country and that the united nations has
and you and i were talking about this earlier which is their founding documents
constitutions of the united states the maastricht treaty or the treaty of rome to the two founding
documents of the european union and the u.n charter are all flawed in the most fundamental ways
that they are almost unamendable at this point and yet we need to amend them in order to make these
institutions relevant to the world we're facing but the eu to me is is the best example we've got so far
because of this notion of actually giving up some sovereignty then they also created another
innovation that that gets to a point patrick that you were talking about they they created the concept
of subsidiarity which is that problems ought to be delegated to the unit of government best able to
provide a solution to that problem so if it's better handled by the city government of san francisco to
manage let's say regular building code regulations for you know better earthquake sustainability
that's obviously where that should happen if the problem is a planetary problem like climate change
we ought to be creating institutions that can manage that problem as a planetary problem and
regional organizations like the european union or the african union or asean in in southeast asia
are beginning to play another intermediary role and the nation state is not going to be irrelevant
but it needs to become less dominant because who fights wars it's nation states right you know who
who violates the paris climate agreement it's nation states who withdraws from the paris climate agreement a
nation state um so i i think the nation state which by the way is a 17th century invention
in the treaty of westphalia which ended the 30 years war in 1638 and we're still living with this
concept and it's not that we need to eliminate it but it's part of the logic of the past that needs to
be really rethought and redesigned as part of a logic for the future something occurs to me from what you
said that um that there's too high of a bar for amending the u.s constitution even the youngest person here
will probably never see an amendment to the u.s constitution even though there's 27 of them and
it used to work but two-thirds of the state legislators voting for something it just seems very unlikely at
this point the uh changing the u.n charter has a similar two-thirds bar um the the cop process for
the paris agreement requires unanimity for each cop statement at the end of the year which is impossible
and so they're talking about unanimity minus one or minus five european union has the problem of
luckily they have some tools to beat on um if there's one country like say hungary being recalcitrant
they can beat on that country and override it but mostly these are too high of bars so in california
if you're a member of a of a hippie commune that is actually a homeowner's association
you have a ccnrs that have a two-thirds of all of the residents have to vote yes before you can
change anything in it it's much the same yeah i just want to say the world needs what california has
which is called the lazy voter act if you make a legitimate attempt and you don't get to two-thirds
but you get to something like 50 percent you can take it to a judge who will look at it and say okay
you did the best you can these are lazy voters i'm passing it so now we need a world court in
hdwell style some and we have a world court although it doesn't really function as such but
someone to say that if you've gotten to 60 but not 67 you could still make institutional changes
yes we're somewhat frozen yeah in older formulations that are not flexible enough and not fit for purpose
that's right so we are in a scary situation in that regard and there is no such thing as a lazy voter act
although the people running the paris agreement for cop 30 and bel-em brazil by the time they get there
will have proposals to change that process so it doesn't become completely irrelevant by being so
so damn slow you know the the term that i uh like for for this concept of moving away from unanimity or
moving away from these very high bars is sufficient consensus not unanimity but sufficient consensus do we
have do we have enough consensus that it means this is the direction we should go it's the lazy voter
concept but with a different kind of twist although consensus in english it either means everybody or it
means most and that's not unusual for a word to have two meanings that cross cut each other but in this
case a little unfortunate it is it is confusing what kind of consensus do you mean well we don't know until we
hash it out yeah it's so helpful for you both to call to attention how the government of the place
where we are having this conversation was once an act of great imagination the major governance structures
that organize other parts of the world and actors were once acts of great imagination
stephen your logic for the future was and you yourself were instrumental in shaping the u.n
summit for the future and the resulting pact for the future which was a serious collaborative attempt at
active imagination within the u.n context and i'm really curious what did you observe there
how are you seeing these ideas that you're advocating for finding purchase in the real world well the summit
of the future was um an idea put forward by the secretary general guterres who has framed it i think
really quite elegantly he said um the the international system designed by our grandparents is not fit for the
future our grandchildren deserve and that's exactly the problem so he decided that while he was secretary
general he was going to organize a process to actually think about the u.n we need as opposed to the u.n
we have and that became the summit for the future which was a heads of state summit but with two years of
negotiations among the 193 member states around iteration after iteration of this pact the outcome
document that was finally adopted and both stan and i and this i think is a wonderful little coincidence
you know that mary murphy the minister for the future and stan's novel was an irish diplomat and
politician and by complete coincidence the woman that secretary guterres tasked with organizing the
summit of the future was an irish diplomat named michelle griffin and we both got to know her and
she's an extraordinary global public servant and it was an audacious idea to have a summit of the future
i mean it was really an audacious idea and a lot of people in the beginning didn't take it very seriously
because it was utopian and so the the real challenge is how do you take a utopian idea and begin the
the iterative process of actually getting to something meaningful and when you're negotiating
with 193 sovereign states that is a messy process at the very best and it had to be a consensus document
not a not of the sufficient consensus type but of the unanimous consensus type and it almost got lost
at the very end literally at the 11th hour there was a motion put forward by russia that would have
derailed the entire thing and it was the african group of nations in the general assembly that pushed back the
hardest and they managed to get this thing adopted with only five countries voting for russia's amendment which failed
so it was a pretty remarkable story and and the document if you read it it's not fun reading like
stan's books um it's pretty turgid but it's a it's a very important benchmark written in un language but it
has 56 commitments that the nation states make the 193 members to building the un of the future that we need
now it falls short in a lot of areas but it's the first major statement about un security council
reform that the un has adopted since 1963. it has a remarkable statement or annex document which is
called the global pa the global digital compact which is especially for this audience something i really
commend you to read and then there's a further annex called the compact for future generations
and one of the things that came out of this is that the secretary general is now going to appoint an
envoy for future generations not just youth not today's youth but literally the unborn and what
are their rights in this world of the future so it was a utopian concept very audacious a lot of people were
very skeptical but you know what was so inspiring was that these diplomats just you know normal regular human
beings who happened to be diplomats worked really hard at this and compromised and there was a lot of
give and take and they've now put out this kind of baseline and now it's up to to get to our earlier
conversation who's going to hold them accountable yeah and that's going to have to happen through global
civil society through movements through think tanks through investigative journalism through all the means
that we've been holding countries accountable for their climate commitments and all of the things
we've done to hold people accountable for their human rights commitments and we're going to have to
do the same and up the ambition because this this pact even as good as it is is not going to solve this
global problem but it's a start and we need to build on it and make it something really really meaningful
how would you invite people in the audience in the community in the global community of long-term thinkers
into this process of imagination that they can see a role for themselves in shaping
something along the lines of the planetary governance features that you've been speaking about
i was in germany when a group of women came up to me and said we we run a ministry for the future
um it's a kindergarten so we all can do stuff yeah that was a great moment yeah we all can do stuff we
already know it already and for sure and there's a this is a moment to speak to the glory and comfort
of being a californian i mean san francisco is the cultural leader of the world and then also it's
the obvious cultural center of california and so being here or near it around it you you can feel the
the buzz of the the shadow of the future the making of the future by the collective action of people here
you don't have to fight or be a tiny minority it's actually just san francisco culture the leading
the world into what diversity equity and inclusion yeah so arrest this man yeah and i will say that
there are some people in washington dc who i would say you know there's genocide there's ecocide there is
attempted future side to kill the future which you cannot do so this is a fantasy of people sticking
their head in the sand and hoping that they could go back to the past various kinds of bad fantasy
and as a science fiction writer i hate fantasy of course but these people you cannot kill the future
it comes and it comes no matter what a few reactionaries do in a momentary seizure of power
it's coming anyway they can't stop it i also want to say that stan's book this is not san francisco but
it's another important intellectual and creative community called oxford university and a group of
scientists and scholars at oxford were so inspired by stan's book that they've created the ministry for
the future and maybe you should say a word about that yes it's a beautiful thing oxford
university hartford college and a couple of the business schools there's an oxford ministry
for the future and i am instantly emeritus and advisory it's better to be instantly emeritus than
actually have to do the work but i asked them to follow one topic or another at the end of april it
will be about the health of wild animals and things like interspecies money or various kinds of
debt for nature trades how can we um introduce into a political economy our fellow citizens that
happen to be the other creatures our cousin creatures what you're called our horizontal brothers and
sisters yeah so that will be just one topic at oxford ministry for the future and they'll have two or
three meetings a year to talk about these things and oxford does have a immense crowd of interesting
thinkers gathered there to talk to each other it's a complicated ecology but it's actually quite
productive and and fruitful they they're excited to be there they're having a good time they're
talking their heads up it's amazing how long the days go uh i i'm i'm i've been stunned in the most
literal sense days there so i'm happy that it's working i'm really happy at all these things i think
there's a some i mean as an english major of course you believe in sentences but even the phrases
like it couldn't be uh ministry of the future it needed to be ministry for the future and the
the book could have had about there were about 20 titles and i actually for once said no i've got
the right title here don't change it and the ministry for the future as a phrase seems to be
a kind of a spark or a turning of a key in people's imaginations so i'm very happy of course and
and they're doing good things that i'll continue to stay involved in yeah patrick can i just say
one thing about san francisco is you know i i i was thinking about this since you asked me this
question earlier and because of the origins of the u.n in the city i think this is a remarkably
interesting year for this community to think about its role in the future of international relations of
the international system and the kind of creative talent in this ecosystem that is entrepreneurial
imagination and technological imagination and political imagination and societal imagination
are all the things we need to bring into this conversation about an international system that will
actually help us get through this planetary crisis that we're facing and this is a place that can really
contribute enormously to that not to mention the erotic imagination i wasn't going to mention it san
francisco after all you mean that in the creative sense world leader god bless san francisco what can i
say yeah a question from audience member ansh juneija it's clear the u.s is retreating rather than building
global coalitions in this new age of international relations how do you see this going over the next
few years if things continue in this direction and would you adjust your hope for the next decade
considering the current state well i'll just jump in if it's okay yeah yeah so i originally wrote my
monograph in um 2023 and it was published in 2024 before the election and it was before the summit of
the future had actually taken place so at at the end of last year with the summit having taken place and
with the results of the election that we got i went back through the paper to say what should i
what should i change here to make this paper more relevant to the new and i hardly changed a word
because i actually think and this is you know pride of authorship probably taken to extremes but i
actually think the ideas in the paper are more relevant because of what's happening in washington
right now than maybe they were before because one of the one of the most important sub chapters in this
work is that the united states itself needs to completely transform the way it behaves in the world
if we're going to get to the global system that we really need and that is more apparent now
because of the way the united states has been behaving in the last 55 or whatever days it is
and we need to be we need to give up on the notion of great power dominance we need to give up on the
notion that the united states is the indispensable nation a phrase that a very good friend of mine
madeline albright coined and we used to argue about we need to move to the notion that the united
states needs to be an indispensable partner we need to be more humble on the world stage we need
to be more honest on the world stage and not hypocritical we need to back up the international
court of justice and not walk away from it and those things are more apparent now because of what
is happening in washington today so in some ways we have to get through this very very challenging
and potentially very dark period and then you know this is a community that that talks a lot about
creative destruction what we're getting right now is all destruction and no creativity but that gives
us all the opportunity for the creativity which gets back to the imagination theme that we've been
talking about so we got to we got to defend what needs defending we got to protect what needs to be
protected but we then got to use the destruction that's occurred and make something out of it for
the future steven just on this point and i and i want to invite your answer as well stand but steven you
were mentioning backstage about the atlantic charter and what was the environment in which that came to be
yeah i found that inspiring would you share that story so and you will remember this from your own
study of history but in august of 1941 after hitler had literally swept across the european continent
great britain was literally hanging on by a thread the united states was not yet in the war because
pearl harbor didn't occur until december winston churchill and franklin roosevelt met on a destroyer
off the coast of newfoundland and they together drafted a very short beautifully written document
called the atlantic charter which lays out actually a utopian vision for the post-war post-war world
that said the major powers eschew the use of force to settle their differences
there will be freedom from want and freedom from need we will work to solve problems cooperatively and
we will create the mechanisms so that we never have a war like this again they didn't even have
the confidence that they were going to win the war and yet they were able to think through that
darkness pierce the darkness and offer literally a vision a bold ray of light that became a part of the
inspiration for the united nations here in san francisco in 1945 so in in one of the darkest moments in human history
people of moral and political imagination were able to pierce that darkness and and move to something that was
you know just an extraordinary accomplishment and that's what we need to do in this period
it's exactly what we need to do and they married it so this is the last point i'm sorry i'm probably
going on too long here but uh it was it was this marriage of political and moral imagination
and political will they not only had the vision they were determined to make it happen
and that's what we're going to need to build yeah hopefully we can i'm thinking about this
subsidiarity a san francisco the cultural capital of california california the great the great state the
great um world space between the the gold rush hollywood and silicon valley some kind of
magical catastrophe um that is our state so then subsidiary america well it is a dispensable country
as an idea of everybody getting along together from all over the world like in california the 115
languages and the the sense that everybody could come here and make something new in history the
utopian dream of america also the horrible empire the manifest destiny the genocide of the native americans
the two stories are tied together like conjoined twins they can't be separated they can only be
improved by clear sight and by acknowledging both parts of it so that while you have to fight
a bad vision of america that's still being inflicted on us five percent of the world's population about
seven percent of the world's land surface and about 70 percent of the world's capital and also the u.s
dollar the benchmark currency so a fiscal empire of immense power but empires fall yeah and when they
fall apart people who are devoted to the idea of that empire get very upset but there's some huge
advantages to not being an empire because an empire is always oppressive a form of master slave
relationship that isn't good so the bad part of america if if there are suddenly people in power who
are proclaiming it as the greatest possible value what it is is give an opportunity for saying no that's
not the right part of america there's another right part of america and a lot of that is illustrated
in california but it needs to be done at the federal level and then i want to add a little story i just
saw maybe it was yesterday stanford economist actually said oxford now and dolan farmer a a map
of all the things it needs to make your laptop and it was a map of the world and there were like i don't
know 60 dots on the map and therefore about 300 lines between the dots on the map and this is just to make
one laptop for you and not to mention the expertise etc etc you can't do terrorists you can't raise a
fortress america this whole thing is again a fantasy it's a stupid fantasy and there's a certain viciousness
to it but it can't be enacted because you can't even make a a laptop without engaging the entire world
globalization for better and worse it worked we are in a global economy and we're in a global
technology in the terms of the supply chains which he doan taught me it's not really chains it's more
networks and loops it's a it's an ecology that we've created for ourselves that is our economy
to think that one nation even the one that holds the dollar could uh dominate and bully around all the
other parts of the network really no this is what i think is that this fantasy will crash and then
we will have to pick up pieces damage is being done i want to say this that hammering national institute
of health is particularly stupid and vicious because it's a murder suicide in that everybody suffers when
there isn't medical research everybody so then you have to ask why do it now there are people struggling
mightily in washington and new york and around the world thinking well there must be some rational urge
behind it no i'm going to say it's simply the goethe dammerung it's if i have to go down the world's going
down with me it's the god damning the world it's the twilight of the gods this is a kind of malignant
narcissism there is not an economic plan behind it there's various smoke screens but behind underneath
it is an urge to destroy because every time 10 billion dollars of medical research is devoted to
medical research say 10 billion the average lifespan of all humans on earth goes up by about a month
you can too social scientists do this uh cost benefit analysis so i was i've been talking to
college students in the last couple weeks and i'd like to shock them a little bit with the idea that
them being young they are going to suffer the most loss of lifetime that the last 55 days or whatever
has shortened their life by months to years and sometimes of course you know they're 25 they're
thinking well i'm never going to die anyway much less get old but nevertheless if you talk
about it as actual tables and say let's get real for a while and what's real well death is real that's
the incontrovertible reality and when you begin to shorten humans lifespans in order to pursue a cause
that doesn't even have a rationale to it then you're in a destructo derby type mentality then and these
people need to be resisted and hopefully stopped and reversed and and that will be hard i mean you can
break something in six months that it'll take 10 years to fix but some things you can just overturn
immediately say no that's wrong let's fix it back to right so we are in a in a wicked political battle
now but i think reality bites they call it reality because you can't escape it with a fantasy you stick
your head in the ground and then you drown so reality will win in the end and therefore the people
who are the party of reality will win in the end this is a question from kevin kelly
describe how a representative government for eight billion people might work does it scale
well this might be a kevin kelly idea in which case it's very recursive but i just heard this
um in taiwan you gather together assist a group of citizens like in a jury system come on down and
we'll host you you got your food you get maybe a per diem and a time off from work we're going to give
you a political problem we want you to brainstorm about it so they do that and we've all been in
brainstorming sessions syfu it's a brainstorming sessions you know what they're like mostly you walk
away and think well that was kind of a waste of a day but what they do here in this program is they
give it to a large language model and they say turn today's brainstorming post-it notes into two
pieces of legislative language bills to be enacted that the taiwanese legislature has already agreed to
consider as legislation suddenly you've got crowdsource legislation that it bypasses the gatekeepers
and the bot lobbyists etc and it would scale you would actually have it's still representative and
for once there's ai assistance that looks to be quite useful because they do summarize quite you
know they could do something in about 30 seconds that might take two months for a human to do and
then the human's bias would bias it anyway so there's something quite interesting going on in this
crowdsourced legislation that might scale yeah i agree with that there are all kinds of experiments with
various forms of citizens assemblies that are kind of facilitated and moderated citizens gatherings for
deliberation that then are actually utilized by legislative bodies and you could you know with
technology you can scale these things quite remarkably now and i think that's the way we have to get at
this um and you know i'm i'm not yet an advocate for world government i think that's an idea that you know is
scary for people and also is not adequate i think it's more complicated than thinking about a kind of a name
but i do think these ways of aggregating citizen opinion and citizen contribution
is a really good way to start this process this is a question from peter schwartz in
writing in from hawaii oh never mind peter yeah in a number of your books stand for example in aurora
uh complexity defeats human's ability to control it why
it will control so aren't those two kind of um
those those words come from different complexity is emergence out of from bottom up from earlier simpler
systems and then suddenly there's a break if i understand it right complexity theory up to an
emergent level to something unexpected that in the earlier iteration couldn't predict and so
lots of things are complex life weather um the universe and everything and then control
well this is a word from a completely different universe of sort of um engineering
and even the engineering schools would say look we're not about control we're about coping
so i think it's always important to make these points i don't know that aurora aurora is a starship
novel where people go out to another planet and realize that we only willy will thrive on this planet
and they try to get back home maybe that's an attempt at control let's control our environment
completely and move somewhere else and then the complexity of the situation drives them back to
the place that they co-evolved with that i think is one story to tell i have a beautifully short
question here from don means who writes china question mark
right exactly
uh well fortunately um i've been going to china since 1976 when i was just recently out of college
and have been working there on and off pretty much ever since and we are still working there at the
foundation i have an office in beijing and i serve on kind of to my own surprise the government the
chinese government appointed me to a high level international advisory body on environment and
development which they take extremely seriously you you wouldn't see anything like this in washington
by the way i have really come to appreciate the complexity of china and also the extraordinary
progress that china is making in a lot of fields and
and we are actually moving more and more to a world where there are two really important major powers
china and the united states economically technologically environmentally militarily this is you know to
simplify one could argue this is becoming a g2 world not a g20 world so the future of u.s china relations
is absolutely the most consequential relationship of the 21st century and if we get it wrong
we're going to have planetary catastrophe and that's why we have to change the thinking about
china dramatically and people who are trying to get us to think oh we're now in a new cold war
and the war is with china are pulling us back into the logic of the past which is are these binaries
of us versus them and a bipolar kind of world and it won't work and we have to recognize the the
complexity of the subtleties of the nuances and compete with china where we must cooperate with china
where we must and avoid confrontation with china for the benefit of the planet and that is not an easy
matter but we are not going about it in a very thoughtful way so the one proposal that i put in
my monograph was that because this relationship is so important it shouldn't be left to episodic meetings
of top level officials the summits of the of the presidents or even meetings of the secretary of the
treasury and the finance minister of china where the foreign affairs ministers or the environment
ministers etc that's all very important and necessary but it's not sufficient for managing this
relationship in a constructive manner and i propose creating an actual joint entity in some neutral place
like geneva or singapore where high level civil servants in the key ministries of both countries are
literally seconded to work together on a day-to-day basis
a day-to-day basis and argue with each other and debate each other and produce new ideas and write
papers and send them back to their capitals and work on this relationship so that we get it right
because china question mark is the question of the 21st century
lovely
a great long now question here from gideon
how do you stoke interest in long-term utopian thinking right now when people are so focused on
short-term catastrophism
i think it's harder than hell especially people are stressed and in the precariat which means almost
everybody on the other hand it's a natural thing or it's a cultural thing you you care intensely about
your kids and then about your grandkids and you only have to take one more step to
think your grandkids are going to have grandkids and it won't take very long for that to happen
and you get to the kind of indigenous notion of the seven generations and the seven generations
that came to you that gave you what you are and then what you give to the seven generations along
that's not a very hard notion to talk to people about and then if they can clear any kind of a space in
their heads from the daily pressure to make ends meet um it's it's as natural as being human
yeah isn't there something liberating in a way about thinking about the future
instead of focusing on your problem today focusing on something that is longer term and offers the
possibility of something very optimistic i think can also be reinvigorating in how we address the
problems we face on a day-to-day basis completely long-term thinking i like to say is the polar opposite
of being in a constant crisis mindset i want to close this evening's conversation this journey of
imagination from the planetary to the international to the local with zooming out into the future and
asking each of you to inspire us with a vision of what it would feel like for imagination to really
blossom in our future stephen you had a front row seat to the fall of the berlin wall
stand in your novels when you get to the end of them you can feel sometimes this resolution and
imagination working how might that feel for us in the future in very unexpected ways i suspect
and you mentioned the berlin wall i i happened to be in berlin one month before the wall fell
and i went through checkpoint charlie from west to east spent the day in the east went back through
checkpoint charlie in the evening and i left berlin after that visit thinking this divided city is a
as an abomination and it's not going to change in my lifetime one month later
so the point is we can get ourselves convinced that things won't change and then they will change
and the question is are we prepared at that moment to make the best of it and so to me the future is
going to be about those unexpected moments and how we as a human society react to them and the more we
think about that the better prepared we will be not for the thing we can't imagine which is in that
instance the fall of the berlin wall but for the things we can imagine that we can then say oh now
that this has happened we can do some things to get closer to that you know just to end on this because
i think it's quite relevant i would say that period from 1989 when the berlin wall came down to
the end of 1991 when the soviet union collapsed was a moment of missed creativity we especially in
america treated it as a triumphal moment the end of communism the victory of capitalism and democracy
and it was the unique polar moment that we could feel so comfortable in but we did not exercise our
imagination and realized that that was going to be gone like that and it did it evaporated very quickly
and because we weren't able to exercise imagination in that moment we have gotten stuck in the logic of
the past and we are doing things again that are only going to lead us into more international and global
difficulties so thinking ahead and being ready when those unexpected moments happen to pivot
is to me the thing that um we all have to prepare ourselves for yeah thank you
well i thought when i finished ministry for the future that the most unrealistic and utopian part of
it was the idea of eo wilson's idea of half earth that we would uh confine humanity's impact on the earth to
about half of the earth's surface and the oceans and um they would wild animals and um the the biosphere
at large the living cousins would prosper and then we'd be healthier oh that's a beautiful dream
so i put it in that novel but now we can think 50 years out there's um 30 by 30 program in california
and in the world at large 30 percent of the land surface and of the ocean left to the wild
creatures this is so fast that turning point the the first the idea of it and it wasn't wilson's
idea there were precursors in various space cadets in early american history in early 20th century history
imagining these things and then wilson codifying it up into a system and now we've got a state program
i met jennifer norris the head of california's 30 by 30 program she tells me that in california
we're at about 25 percent and we need to get to 30 and we're going to get there and everybody in
her program talks about 50 by 50 that by 2050 we have half the earth well this implies regenerative
agriculture and it implies a health for our fellow creatures it implies dodging the mass extinction
event so not only can you imagine out to a utopian space but you can see the the roots of it and the
first shoots of it since we're in springtime you know the rapid growth of spring and this is unstoppable
even by negative forces out there it's there's a there's a certain kind of a momentum in world history
right now that those things and i've just spent the last five years traveling the world talking to
people about these very issues and um it's been intense and it's been super interesting it's kind of
like the way steward and kelly have lived the last 50 years and i'm amazed it's it's quite a uh an effort
but it's interesting right it's interesting because you learn a lot and i you also get a sense that
humans as a group are realizing that eight billion people on the planet is intensely dangerous situation
it's a technological achievement it's unstable as hell and we got to work to make it more stable so
that everybody has that adequacy of of life means and and the opportunity this is very san francisco to
become more like themselves than ever before which i think is a great definition of utopian space it's it's
there's a there's a role towards it that if we can thread the needle or the needles in this next few
decades that we can get to a space that is really quite astonishing in terms of its potential yeah
so let's hold the hold the line here and um you know keep our nerve and hang together in fact this
is another great american short story we must all hang together or else we will all hang separately
and stuff right so let's hang together here here thank you thank you steven thank you stan for inspiring
us to think long term thank you for calling us to imagination and for being here with us this evening
thank you so much thank you thank you thank you all
you
