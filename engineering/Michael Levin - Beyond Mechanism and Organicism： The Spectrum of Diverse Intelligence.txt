is that perfect we see them and i think uh spirit on yes i'm going to introduce michael hi michael
so michael levine is the van vannevar bush distinguished professor of biology at tafts
university an associate faculty at harvard's weiss institute and the director of the allen
discovery center at tafts thank you so much um so i'm going to uh try to uh talk about some ideas
today in fairly a brief format given the time constraint so if anybody is interested in the
the full data sets the software the the videos everything is at this at the site here and then
this is my own personal blog as to uh what i think all of these things mean so uh one of the things
that we are interested in is uh augmenting this idea of the search for uh extraterrestrial intelligence
with what i call suti which is the search for unconventional terrestrial intelligence i'm
going to tell you that i think that uh there are minds all around us which we are currently very
bad at recognizing and you know this uh this there are two two key things one is one is to have the
right perspective and i will try to widen our perspective today this is a pile of forks and
knives and and spoons that if you have the right perspective you actually see a pattern that is not
at all obvious from from first first glance and the other issue is that i'm going to claim that uh any
kind of a cognitive assessment of a system whether we think it's intelligent what degree of intelligence
it has or cognition or or whatever it's really an iq test for us too it's a it's a bi-directional
interaction that requires the observer namely us but also parasites conspecifics and so on to uh have
the ability to detect the agency of other systems so if we don't if we don't see it it may be the
problem may be with us and so what i would like uh to do is to um contribute to a kind of unification
so this is this is the electromagnetic spectrum and uh prior to having a proper theory of electromagnetism
we thought that there were many diverse phenomena there was light and magnets and static electricity
and lightning we thought all of these were different things and there were huge areas of that spectrum
to which we were completely blind because our own evolutionary history does not allow us uh the
default access to it and then what the what the theory of electromagnetism allowed us to do is to first
of all unify all those phenomena and realize that even though they seem different and uh they look like
they belong in different uh categories they're actually all the same thing and um different
aspects of the same thing and it enabled technology that lets us now access other parts of that spectrum
so go beyond our own limitations and uh do things that improve the quality of life and i think this
is a very good metaphor for where we currently stand in our ability to recognize um things that we're
interested in in the cognitive sphere when they come in unfamiliar embodiments and i think this is a
kind of mind blindness and and what i think is important is to develop uh conceptual frameworks
that help us get around it and the technology that helps us to engage with that in a very practical way
so what i try to do is among many other things is to develop a framework that allows us to think about
very uh diverse kinds of minds uh all all at the same time so yes uh apes and birds and things that
we're familiar with and maybe an octopus or a whale but also some very strange creatures colonial
organisms and swarms and then very importantly engineered new life forms so synthetic biology
also uh potential ais whether software or robotic someday maybe exobiological agents and then
something else that's quite interesting that i probably won't have time to get to today which
is erasing the distinction between patterns and uh and objects and so there are many interesting
patterns that i actually think have agency that are very hard for us to recognize
so um i'm certainly not the first person to try to do this uh here's wiener um uh rosenbluth and
bigelow uh back in 1943 trying for a scale now now they were working with certain phase transitions
they thought but but basically a cybernetic scale that goes all the way from passive matter all the way
up to second order metacognitive humans and whatever is beyond that so so what i would like to do is to
develop this kind of framework with with uh the idea that first of all it is not uh just uh philosophy
i think philosophy is very important but it is not only philosophy it is good to the extent that uh
that framework will move uh progress forward in other words i i i want to see it drive new science
uh new a new new engineering and better ethics in other words it has to be practical these things have
to be um they have to uh demonstrate their utility at the bench they can't just be just be ideas and
the details of much of it at least the first version is is all here so uh what i'm interested
in is um a a a view of of the spectrum of uh of cognition that i call the axis of persuadability and
i and i say persuadability because i would like to cash out cognitive claims as interaction protocols in
other words when you tell me that a system has a certain degree or kind of cognitive capacity what
i what i hear is you are telling you are announcing what is the interaction protocol that you will have
with it you will use tools of physical rewiring or perhaps cybernetics and control theory or perhaps
behavior science or perhaps a psycho a psychoanalysis and friendship and love and whatever else is up here
so what you're saying is i'm going to make a hypothesis i'm going to use a particular set of tools
and then we are all going to find out how how that went for us for both sides which means that
uh this kind of thing is to be decided empirically not by trying to hew to ancient philosophical
categories or uh ideas about what kinds of substrates are have some sort of a monopoly or is substrates
and origin stories such as evolution would have a monopoly on making minds we can't decide this out
of an armchair we have to do experiments and this is this is what we've been trying to develop another
way of looking at this actually is uh what happened to the notion of numbers so you know people started
with net with counting numbers and then somebody came up with zero and then eventually negative uh
integers and eventually uh fractions and then and then you know irrationals and so on and what happens
every time you do this is several things first of all you have to make a conceptual leap you have to
break the old category that that demarcated the kinds of things that um you were uh you you you thought you
were dealing with um and uh and it's actually quite painful i mean people died over over you know
irrational numbers and things like this so all of these are are disruptive and so what i uh what i
would like to talk about and i'm only going to get to a portion of this today is learning to recognize
minds in uh increasingly more um unfamiliar embodiments that uh that are that are weirder and weirder
and and more unconventional but i think that's exactly the journey that that we've been on in
science and and in mathematics and so um uh you know i'll probably i'll probably only get to here
but but let's do some of this um the the the one one thing that uh that actually frames a lot of these
kinds of discussions is this ancient uh pre-scientific vision which is this this is called uh adam names
the animals in the garden of eden and the idea here is is very simple there are discrete natural kinds
we all know what these animals are uh and they all they're all you know brainy sorts of sorts of things
and and adam of course is different from them but the most interesting part for me is that it was his
in this biblical story it was his job to name the animals now the god couldn't do it the angels couldn't
do it adam had to do it and that was uh because first of all in those ancient traditions naming something
means that you've discovered its true inner nature right that's the the deep meaning of naming
something and also because adam was the one that was going to be living with them and he had to be
the one to discover their inner nature and name that that's what i take away from this story so i
think that's um the the part of this that's completely wrong is is these these very um a focus
on on these uh discrete brainy kinds but what's i think deeply right about this is that we are all
going to have to name in this sense a very wide and very strange um set of uh set of beings so
first of all let's just let's just start with brains uh pretty pretty easy we see something like this
so so this one uh this this little creature is going to uh set up a little accident scene
uh here like this he puts the thing uh puts the thing on his uh on his neck uh in a minute he's
going to check to see if his uh his parents are watching he has a very good theory of mind he
understands uh you know what the reaction is going to be and so so this kind of stuff is obvious medium
sized objects uh moving at medium speeds they're similar to us we have it's pretty easy for us to
detect minds in in animals that do that do this kind of stuff actually even that story is not very
simple um there are numerous cases which uh we reviewed karina kaufman and i reviewed recently
where uh the mapping between uh the brain and cognitive performance is is completely broken so
there are patients with very little brain tissue like this and actually normal or above normal
cognitive performance so even even in brainy animals the story is not at all simple as to as to
what's going on and this is a theme that's going to come up towards the end is that um in in certain
cases you actually get a lot more performance than the hardware seems to warrant and that raises some
interesting questions about why the current models of neuroscience don't predict this it's not that
this can't be hammered in like epicycles into the current model but the model certainly doesn't
predict that anything like this is going to happen so so there's a problem and and this is this is
the this is the problem that you often get more performance than um than you can account for
with with its history or or with the hardware let's let's let's leave that aside for a second
and uh what we're going to talk about is a model system that we've been studying which is uh cells
as a collective intelligence living in anatomical morphospace it's a it's a kind of an intermediate
stepping stone to some of the much stranger kinds of things that i want to talk about because uh to
some extent it is uh similar to us and in many ways it's it's very different so we're going to look at
this as a model system uh first of all let's let's remember that we are all composed of an agential
material in other words at many scales we are not made of passive matter we are made of components
that have their own agendas so this is a single cell this is a single cell it's a it's it's called a
lacrimaria uh which is a free living organism but you get the idea our cells like this one there's no
brain there's no nervous system uh but there's there's uh extreme competence in its tiny little
agendas you know it has a small cognitive light cone of time and space that it cares about and uh and
it's and it's very good at handling things in that um in that in that scenario now it turns out that
even even uh within the cell that that thing already is made of a material that has some competencies
itself so just molecular networks never mind uh the cell never mind nuclei or synapses or any of
that stuff just small molecular networks by themselves can do six different kinds of learning
including pavlovian conditioning they can do habituation sensitization associative learning and
so on in fact if you train them you will find out that uh that training increases the causal emergence
so phi d for example uh will increase over the network so actually uh a training within an
environment and forming associative memories actually reifies the nature as the the the nature of this
of this system as something distinct from the sum of its parts as quantified by recent advances in
causal information theory so so even the material of which the cells are made themselves already has
certain uh cognitive capacities we in the lab are taking advantage of this to train the the networks
and to do things like drug conditioning and so on it's a very practical um kind of thing this is um
this is not just not just theory it's very uh very it has many implications for biomedicine
and so on and you can you can see all of that here so uh what we what we uh what we have actually and
i could spend um hours uh talking about each level but but fundamentally we have this thing uh that i
call a multi-scale competency architecture that basically all the way from from the molecular networks to
uh large groups of organisms at each level what you have are problem solving agents that have uh specific uh
ability to uh to pursue goals with various degrees of ingenuity uh each each of these levels solves
problems in different spaces however they don't all live in three-dimensional space the way that
conventional behavior does they live in some other spaces for example uh the space of gene i think they
navigate using the the familiar loop of sensing uh decisions make making decisions and then taking
actions they do they deploy that loop in transcriptional space so high dimensional space
of gene expression anatomical morpheus space the space of possible uh three-dimensional organizations
physiological state spaces metabolic state spaces and so on biology does this in many spaces and it was
doing this long before nerve and muscle came on the scene by which a conventional behavior that we're
we're all you know pretty obsessed with the three-dimensional world and we think embodiment especially
for ais if it doesn't have a robot that's uh bumping around the 3d world we say well that thing's not
embodied i think this is this is a fundamental mistake and that's true also of organoids and things
like this just because it's not rolling around our three-dimensional world uh and and in fact it may
be navigating these other spaces that are very difficult for us to visualize but we're making tools
to uh to to help us do that so let's just talk about this anatomical morpheus space um for for for a
little bit uh with the hypothesis here is that basically uh and and we've we've i used to do
that i used to have my students as do this by hand as a as an exercise and then we made a we made a tool
that you can you can play with here called field shift basically you can take almost any neuroscience
paper in other words uh in the field of neuroscience where we study the the sort of uncontroversial
example of cognition meaning you know brainy brainy humans and animals um it turns out that all of
those concepts are actually very well mapped onto some very different problem spaces so if you take
a a neuroscience paper and you basically change all the scales for minute from milliseconds to minutes
and uh you basically instead of every time it says neuron you just say cell you actually get yourself a
very nice uh developmental biology paper because the same kinds of things that are happening in your
brain to underlie your cognition meaning the the cognitive glue that that electrophysiology
uh enables those same exact processes were were functioning because they're they're ancient
evolutionary precursors to brains were functioning to to act as the cognitive glue to cellular swarms
in morphogenesis that is where our brain gets all these um these amazing tricks so i just wanted to
show you a couple of a couple of examples again we could we could spend hours on some of these amazing
things but but just very simply just to remember that you know uh embryonic development so you start
here as a as an egg and then you get to to this it's very reliable but that is not why i'm going
to argue this is this phenomenon involves the behavior of a collective intelligence it's not
because it's reliable it's not because uh there's emergent complexity that increases here those are cheap
and easy that's it's very easy to get those what i'm talking about specifically is problem solving in
terms of intelligent navigation of anatomical amorphous space um one thing you see immediately is that uh
if you if you cut this thing in half it does not do what uh context insensitive mechanisms do which
is they do the same hardwired thing no actually if you cut it into pieces you don't get half bodies
you get perfectly normal monozygotic twins triplets because all of these things can navigate the morpheus
space to this ensemble of goal states that we call a normal human target morphology from different
starting positions avoiding various local maxima um uh that that process is actually much more general i think
development is actually just a special case of regeneration uh it's extreme regeneration where
you have to repair uh the entire body from just one cell um and and again navigating anatomical space
you start at where the single cell is and then you you end up at the space of a at the configuration of
whatever kind of creature you are but but some some creatures do this in in adulthood so again
this uh this axolotl if you amputate the limb anywhere the cells immediately can tell that they're that
they've been deviated from their correct position they they act really quickly to reduce the error
and then they stop and this is the most amazing thing about regeneration is that it knows when to
stop when does it stop it stops when the correct salamander limb has been completed meaning they
stop when they are back at the same position in that in that morpheus space meaning this is a homeostatic
process it's a process of error reduction and it's a process of pursuing a specific goal now now who has
this goal the individual cells do not no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers
you're supposed to have but the collective absolutely knows in the only sense that matters
which is the practical question if we try to deviate it from its goal is it going to try to get back and
if so with what degree of ingenuity that is that is the question and and i'm using uh william james's
definition of intelligence here which is the ability to produce pursue the same goal by different
meat and some some degree of that ability in fact uh it's important to note this is this is is in no
way about simply repairing damage this is something much more interesting because uh if you take for
example a tail and you graft it onto the flank of this animal it becomes it it remodels itself into a
limb okay and the most interesting part of this is that the cells at the end of the tail here they
become fingers now locally there's nothing wrong with these cells they're tail tip cells sitting at the
tip of the tail why do they change why do they become their fingers uh why do they become fingers
and that is because this whole this whole system again the at the scale of the whole animal is a an
error minimizing goal-seeking system that tries to maintain a specific state in anatomical space and in
order to do that it does something that all good cognitive systems do which is that it harnesses
molecular mechanisms towards these high level goals so when you and i wake up in the morning and we have
very abstract uh scientific social the financial goals whatever ultimately all of those in order
for us to get up and walk and execute on those goals they have to end up changing the chemistry of
our muscle cells so that the ions flow across the membrane and we can we can get up and walk voluntary
motion is an example of where high level goals that belong to the collective not to the individual
cells are able to harness the biochemistry in in towards those goals the exact same thing is happening
here what the system uh here has ascertained is that what goes at this position is not a tail it's
a limb and so what it does is it harnesses all of the downstream molecular biology needed to tell these
cells to start turning on and off different genes to start migrating around and so on to create fingers
so top-down control of the molecular biology in line with abstract high-level goals that that neither
the molecular circuits understand nor the cells it is a multi-scale control system where the high levels
bend the option space for the lower levels and then they do the thing they do but but the local order
obeys the global plan that's the whole point of this of the system and so so how does this work well
in the brain uh we at least know know the beginnings of how it works we understand that there's hardware
that looks like this so uh electrical uh activity across the muscle membrane sets up voltage gradients
which then do or do not propagate across these electrical synapses and that uh underlies a bunch of
electrophysiological dynamics in the brain that neuroscientists hope to read out in the project
of neural decoding uh and uh and and the idea is that these electrophysiological dynamics uh in some
way uh hold and support all of the cognitive uh processes that need to go on when this creature
navigates three-dimensional space so what do what does this electrical network do it sends signals to
muscles to move you through three-dimensional space where did this amazing trick come from well it
turns out that uh evolution uh discovered this long long before neurons and muscles appeared
and every cell in your body has ion channels most cells have electrical synapses to your neighbors
and all of this kind of stuff the electrical communication that forms networks networks are
very good at integrating information storing memories making decisions uh context sensitive behavior
this was all discovered by evolution around the time of bacterial biofilms it is absolutely ancient
and what happened later once nerve and muscle came on the scene is that it got pivoted into 3d space
instead of anatomical space and uh it got sped up quite a bit so that animals could run around
and try to try to eat each other but basically it's the same scheme where this electrical network
gives signals not to muscles but to all of the cells of your body during embryonic development
during regenerative repair during cancer suppression and then we could talk about all those things
and uh and tries to to to control the navigation of this group of cells through anatomical space
that's what it is thinking about the electrical networks in brains in animal brains think about
movement the electrical networks in uh in your body long before you had a brain thought about moving
your configuration through anatomical space and once um when when uh when when we wanted to pursue this
uh almost 20 years ago now we developed the first molecular tools to read and write the electrical
processes in non-neural cells so basically take the tools of neuroscience and apply them outside the
body to see if we can do the same thing and so for the what i'm showing you here is one example these
are voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes that allow us to without having to poke every cell with an
electrode it allows us to catch all the electrical um uh conversations that these cells are having these
are cells in the early frog embryo these are explanted cells making some decisions about crawling off on
their own versus joining this this morphogenetic event and so so we can read these events we can we
we've made all kinds of simulators so that we can have multi-scale uh simulation of what the information
is that's being processed in these networks we can connect them to uh ideas in dynamical systems theory
and connectionist machine learning such as um a pattern a completion that you just saw in in the
regeneration example and and so on but uh this is just just to show you some some examples of what
that actually looks like so so here's an early frog embryo putting its uh putting its face together
this is a time lapse and if you take one frame from this video you you see very clear you can catch
a memory of what the frog face is supposed to look like so long before this tissue is regionalized by
gene expression you see here's where the eye is going to go here are the placodes here's the where
the mouth is going to be in this this voltage pattern controls the morphogenesis of the face
if i change this pattern the the face changes i'm going to show you that momentarily this is a
this is a snapshot of the kind of thing you would do in a human brain if you wanted to uh catch uh
specific uh correlates of uh of cognitive states that are remembering uh goals or sensing sensing uh
visual inputs and and things like that um you know these these these things are not just a cognitive
glue whoops uh not just a cognitive glue um within within a single uh embryo they are also the kind
of thing that binds together groups of embryos so you can see each one of these things is a separate
embryo uh you can see you can see these waves propagating you know propagating between them
it works on it works on multiple multiple levels and in fact groups of embryos uh have their own
identity they resist teratogens for example much better than individual embryos and you know we have
some understanding now of how that works the collective knows things that individual individual
animals don't know and this is what i think neuroscience is about i don't think it's about
neurons at all i think it's about cognitive glue and different uh policies and mechanisms that can
be used to bind competent subunits into higher units now um track you know of tracking and measuring
these things is all well and good but you actually have to the important thing of course then is
to do functional perturbation experiments so so how do we change this we don't use any applied fields
there are no waves no magnets no frequencies nothing like that what we do is we hack the
interface that the cells are normally using to control each other and that means the electrical
synapses and the ion channels and we have optogenetics and pharmacology and you know all the all
the tools of uh neuroscience that we that we use in non-neural cells to hack this and when we do i'm
going to show you a couple of specific examples one quick thing i want to show you is the takeover
of a cell by a particular very convincing pattern so each so the color here is voltage states uh these
are two frames and then i'm going to play the movie so uh this this cell is is red and what in the next
frame you see that as soon as it touches the rest of these it changes its voltage to be just like them
it only takes a tiny bit of just just a single touch so so here watch so this thing has its own
different voltage it's going to come over here this guy reaches out to touch it bang that's it now now
now it has changed it's got the same bioelectric state as the rest and now it joins into this into
this thing you know these messages are it only takes a tiny bit for specific messages to uh to
radically change the electrical state and this is the kind of thing we take advantage of when we
uh take an early embryo and we use potassium for example potassium channel rna to establish that
little little voltage spot that i showed you in the electric face a few minutes ago we will put that
for example uh in cells that normally would be gut and what it does is it tells those cells no instead
of that an eye goes here and sure enough they build the eye they do all the downstream steps they turn
all the genes you know all the stem cell stuff happens we don't control any of that we don't need to
lens retina optic nerve everything will be there because we gave it a high level prompt just like i'm
giving you now as i'm talking to you i'm not worried about arranging your synapse synaptic proteins so that
you can understand me you will do that yourself i'm using this thin language interface and that's
exactly what's happening here we provide a top level signal that says you should be an eye not
only do they make this eye if there's not enough of them there's only a few here these blue cells are
the ones we injected they will actually recruit all their neighbors just like other collective
intelligences do which ants and termites they recruit their neighbors to solve a bigger pro a bigger
task these guys will do the same we don't need to teach them to do that they already do it okay so so
the material this this this this material is actually has many interesting uh competencies and
what we're learning to do with these bioelectrical uh stimuli is to talk to the material that literally
to communicate messages that have meaning to the cells there's nothing about that voltage spot that
is essential to being an eye it is a completely arbitrary symbol and it only works because um
um they uh uh because they uh they they interpret the rest of the cells interpret this the signal in
a particular um particular way which we now are beginning to understand i want to point out that
that what's happening here is is actually quite interesting you know the conventional molecular biology
story would would be a set of a set of well-known events that lead from a voltage change to the
transduction machinery to the identity of the cells but that's that's actually the same thing as trying to
describe a conversation between between two people in the uh at the at the level of physics of uh well
some air you know some air molecules moved around it miss it misses the whole point what actually
happened here it's not false i mean those molecular processes did take place but what's much more
interesting than that is that at a higher level what's happening here is actually a battle of uh a goal
state and i'll i'll point out this this thing here when we when we inject uh our let's say let's say the eye
inducing signal we injected here when you look at an early embryo looking at the blue color here
indicates which cells are turning on this gene called rix1 it's a very early step of eye development
so so who is on their way to sort of sort of uh beginning eye development what you see here is that
you look you see here okay there's going to be one two three four four you know maybe five there's
going to be all kinds of ectopic eyes fantastic but if you wait eventually there will be maybe only
one or maybe none and if you track it try track it down what actually is happening here is that
okay these cells are saying to their neighbors we should make an eye we should all we should all make
an eye and and but but the rest of the neighbors actually as a part of a cancer suppression mechanism
they resist and they say no we should be gut or skin or whatever they are because it is an ancient
mechanism for cells to look at their neighbors and if the neighbors have some kind of weird voltage you
assume it's a it's an incipient uh tumor and you try to normalize them by equalizing the voltage
so the cells resist so there are two goal states here there are two patterns one one is the eye
pattern one is the let's say let's say skin or gut pattern and uh what's actually happening here is a
competition of those two patterns for the attention of the cells sometimes the eye wins sometimes uh
sometimes the the default wins but you can watch this you can watch these patterns as i just showed
you in those two cells in that in that case the the single cell was taken over in some cases it's not
and so we are now on the search for uh ways to manipulate those decisions because that's the the
key to a lot of regenerative medicine where you can get the cells to buy into your goals not to resist
not to try to adjust elsewhere as many of our drugs cause side effects uh but to actually convince the
cells that that this new goal state is what they should be doing because they do not simply take it up
they they often um resist and it's very much all of these are very much um uh these kinds of uh
cognitive processes so um what i've shown you up until now is uh a way to um change the more and
again i could show you show you many for hours but but i showed you one example to provide uh specific
prompts to the um to the to the network of cells to get them to build something that they already know
how to build for example an eye and i want to show you uh something completely different which
is which is this this this little creature if you look at it uh you might think that i got this out
of uh you know from the bottom of a pond somewhere uh but if you were to uh sequence it you would find
that it's a hundred percent homo sapiens okay it has it is a hundred percent normal human genome these
are cells that were taken from an adult human tracheal epithelium they when liberated from the rest of
the body they form these little things called um called anthrobots uh they don't look like any
stay they don't act like any stage of normal human development they uh first of all they have 9 000
genes expressed differently than the tissue that they came from in other words their transcriptome
is radically different about half the genome is now completely different we did not change the genome we
did not put in any synthetic biology circuits we did not put any uh uh you know uh reprogramming
factors there are no yamanaka factors here uh even though anthrobots are younger than actually younger
than the cells they come from we didn't do any of that what uh what they do is express new genes
based on their new lifestyle their lifestyle has four different behavioral patterns that you can draw
ethograms of and they can do many weird things one of the things they can do is gather together into
this superbot cluster and heal neural wounds this is a big scratch that we made in a neural tissue here if
you lift them up you can see what they're doing they're healing this now whoever thought that your
tracheal cells you know that sit there quietly uh dealing with the with the mucus and things like
that could form a self-motile little creature that uh that can do stuff like this so so this is this
is another uh place where this idea of getting more out than you put in comes from because we know where
uh where you paid for the computation to design a human it was on all of the evolutionary interactions
going back you know a billion years against the environment but there was no selection to be a good
anthrobot there haven't been any anthrobots when when when did we pay for the computation needed to
to know to to have this gene expression these behaviors this kind of capacity um just just
beginning to be studied their memory properties and so on it's uh you know uh there's some there's
some very interesting issues here and so the last thing i'm going to say is this uh we're going to
we're going to take one one step further and we're going to talk about this this issue of uh you
know the plasticity of uh of of life and and so-called machines this is where where i tend to lose a lot
of people you know a lot of audiences are with me up until now you know amazing plasticity of life and
things that weren't directly selected for um you know lots of people like that here's here's the uh
here's the here's the next part uh because uh we know that that this this thing that that we call a
this this this feature is very prominently in in uh lots of discussions of uh of philosophy of mind and
so on the human you know the human mind okay this this is at the center of a smooth and continuous
gradient uh leading up from a single cell in evolution of course from a single cell in
development uh but there's also another gradient which is that again through slow and gradual
changes both technological and biological you know it it becomes really pretty impossible we already
knew it was really hard um here but but it becomes pretty impossible to say when this actually
ends and something else that we want to call with a different name begins this is the this this whole
this whole thing is not about machines and ai it's about this kind of thing it's about the
inevitable um uh symbiosis between um uh human uh evolved in design material and this idea that
we're going to try to be looking at these things and fight and you know and trying to classify them
in these ancient categories that that uh basically come from a time when when nobody thought that this
was possible so so we need to think hard about what is it that we actually mean when we're trying
to give given these continua what is it that we actually mean when we try to put names to these
things and what do we want these names to do for us and i don't have time to go into this in detail
but i i recommend uh i recommend this this paper if anybody's interested basically what we found
is and i and i did this on purpose i i wanted to for sort of maximum shock value to take the simplest
dumbest uh exam most most minimal example that we could and i chose sorting algorithms um if any of
you have done coding this is like bubble sort things like that uh we've they've been known for i
don't know 60 70 years every computer science student studies them the important thing is that
they're completely transparent unlike biology where there's always some kind of hidden mechanism to be
discovered these things are like six lines of code they're completely deterministic you can see exactly
what they're doing uh there's no there's no magic and yet what we found out is that if you look at
them the right way and this was my claim at the very first slide you know you need to know how to
look if you look at them the right way you see two things you see the thing you force them to do the
thing you force them to do which is what's in the actual algorithm which is to sort the numbers
and then and they do that now they have some some competencies you didn't you didn't actually teach
them for example delayed gratification it's nowhere in the algorithm but but they do that but but
that's you know that's that's um delayed gratification navigating a space is an important cognitive
property um so that's that's something but but what you'll notice is that they also do something else
this is and it's called clustering which again is nowhere in the algorithm okay uh they do this
as a kind of uh the way the way that i think about this now is in terms of uh intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation in other words there are the things you forced it to do with the algorithm because they do
follow the algorithm but at the same time they do some other things they have these weird side quests
that are neither forbidden nor prescribed by the physics of the world that they're in so i'm going to
claim and and there's a lot more that could be said about this but it doesn't take life it doesn't
take cells it doesn't take huge complexity to have emergent uh capacities that we would recognize as
uh elements of of what cognitive science is supposed to study including problem-solving competencies and
also a kind of intrinsic motivation so that so that when people say uh when people say uh uh you know uh
uh these ais uh they only do what the algorithm tells them to do they're not like you know they're not
like us we have we have you know we have freedom they they just do what the algorithms say i i my
point is not even bubble sort does only what the algorithm says it should do okay nothing only does
what the algorithm says it should do so we need to we need to really rethink um rethink some of this
stuff and uh my point is is just this you know just like um magritte was telling us that that our
our representation of things is not the thing itself this is uh i i you know our graphic artist i had him
draw this thing which basically says this is not a turing machine because not because my point is
that our formal models of these of computation so turing machines algorithms those kinds of things
do not properly describe uh quote-unquote machines any more than the laws of chemistry describe what our
minds are capable of it is exactly the same the same problem we we we do not understand um uh uh you
know uh the the cop the capabilities of matter and it's because we we somehow assume that uh for for
living and and and conventional beings that that the molecular facts don't tell the whole story but
when it comes to these simple things we we've somehow decided that that those formal models are good
enough to tell you everything you need to know and they're not in in no case are they are they good
enough and so i think that um and so i'm just going to stop here and and say that i think the future
garden of being is going to be a very weird uh and very different place with all kinds of uh uh beings
and radically different embodiments and uh just as a last uh as a last uh um kind of uh topic for
provocation i will just say this that in biology we love two sources of information because you might
want to ask uh where where do where do the um behavioral and anatomical patterns come from the typical
biological answer is two two things physics so so physics uh require certain things and a history
of selection there's a there's a long history that tells you why this creature is exactly the
way it is i just want to remind us all that there is a third uh there's a third option there are facts
of mathematics for example this particular shape that is encoded this is a halley plot that it comes
from this little little tiny seed in complex numbers this is what that looks like this has a very
particular pattern if you wanted to explain why that pattern you could not use any fact of physics
to explain it you could not use any facts of history to explain it there are mathematical
structures that have patterns that are not explained by anything in the physic in the physical world
um some of them are very organic so that that's kind of fun but but the bottom line is that uh it is
not just about uh physics and and and selection i don't think uh you know the physical world is closed
and uh this has a precedent there's a lot of mathematicians so platonist mathematicians
excuse me michael you have 10 minutes 10 minutes left okay i'm almost done i'm i'm almost done one one
couple more slides and i'm done uh so so so there is a precedent for this which is uh this this idea
that that mathematicians are not not not just inventing but actually discovering uh a space of of
structures and uh my point is about all of this stuff is that the reason that in in biology but also
in in in even simple things like sorting algorithms the reason you get more out than you seem to have
put in is very simple because all of the things we build whether they be machines uh embryos biobots
or whatever you know ais whatever it is what we're actually making are interfaces or pointers into a
pre-existing space of patterns and this is not just a random grab bag of uh uh emergent surprises that
we can catalog in our big book of emergence but actually a structured space that can be
investigated the way that the mathematicians investigate their region of that space
we can use these biobots to investigate uh regions of that space that ingress into our
physical world and so in the future because of the the plasticity of biology pretty much any combination
of evolved material engineered material software and these patterns which do not come from the same
places these others uh will make some kind of embodied mind and everything we're used to
is a tiny little corner of this uh option space and we better um get get uh um significantly more
sophisticated in being able to relate uh ethically and productively with beings who are nowhere on the
tree of life with us and uh and and and have radically different uh embodiments and views and so so
i'll stop here and just and just say this um i think that the sharp categories that people like
around life machine and so on have as a matter of empirical fact have not enabled they've constrained
new discovery okay i've yet to understand what any of these distinctions have helped us discover
but dissolving these boundaries by applying tools across disciplines have now led to many many practical
advances i think that uh intelligence in the broad sense is pretty much everywhere uh again can't we we can't
just say it's there we have to do experiments uh perturbational experiments but learning to detect
it is actually essential for progress in biomedicine and uh and ethics and so we now have a research
agenda that that is paying off nicely and the last thing i want to say is this putting living things
on machines on one spectrum does not mean that i am equating life with the kind of simple machine
metaphors that that people like to use my claim is the exact opposite i say that those kinds of metaphors
so so the basic computationalist metaphors are they are inadequate to understand to to deal with what
we mean by life and mind but they are equally inadequate to understand even simple machines
these ingressions from from the space uh occur very early on and uh but basically basically these
these we have to understand that our formal models are not good even at the very low end of that
spectrum so i am not trying to mechanize biology quite the opposite i'm trying to point out that the the
the special and and semi-magical things that we see about life and mind actually extend pretty
much all the way um all the way down and so um i'll just stand here if anybody's interested but lots
of lots of papers that go into this stuff in detail and i want to thank uh the postdocs and the students
who did the work lots of lots of amazing collaborators that work with us i have to do three disclosures these
are companies that have spun out of the work of our lab so some of these philosophical ideas give rise to
very practical uh you know practical applications and medicine environment and so on and um and most
of all um i thank the model systems that we work with because they do all the heavy lifting parts
so i'll stop there thank you
so thank you michael for this fascinating talk we have actually only four minutes left um okay josh
great thank you um uh first of all i really enjoy your work been following it for a little bit um um
i'd i'd love to have where you started and where you ended but as you already sort of prefaced it's
it's that interesting sort of middle part that i have a question about um specifically um well local
field potential for example i understand that your work as you clearly stated doesn't apply any field
or but you wouldn't i suppose you wouldn't necessarily or would you deny that local field
potential as as a uh shared phenomenon amongst um cells whether neural or not um that it could that
it could not be at this higher order causal um aspect of your model and that furthermore to one of your
final conclusions about machinic approaches um wouldn't something like local field potential um not be
available to uh turing equivalent um state-based uh computation thank you thank you so much uh
first first of all yeah absolutely uh local field potentials are are are important i i love for example
earl miller's work looking at those kinds of things uh in in brain cognition i mean great all of that is
great um i i agree with you that uh the standard turing pattern paradigm is insufficient for continuous
field based type of phenomena but i will also point out that you don't need to get that exotic to to
to find out that is that it is insufficient it is it we already we can already see it as insufficient
when you pull together a six-line algorithm for sorting numbers you already find out that even there
uh the we we um our understanding of algorithms and what they do in the way they run uh simple machines
already there there is something going on that is not captured by that so yeah i'm right i'm i'm not
at all arguing that the touring paradigm captures any of this it captures some useful things for sure
but like all models it hides some very important stuff and we are now in a position to uh to investigate
it okay so we have time for one more question timothy eastman
yes greetings and thank you for a great presentation i understand that wet chemistry is often just simply
presumed to be mappable to uh classical physics framework and understanding without remainder and yet
clearly uh that's simply an approximation and all systems at multiple levels are really quantum
systems we live in a quantum world and so some of these effects you're describing may really be so
to speak tapping into fundamental quantum process or quantum substratum any comments yeah um they might
and i'm sure and by the way i will preface this by saying i'm no expert on on quantum anything but but i
will just point out the following uh i'm i'm sure that there are quantum phenomena that biology in
particular uh makes use of uh perhaps some of the some of the non some of the abiotic phenomena does
well but it does as well but i will just say this the kind of uh lack of closure of the physical world
meaning meaning the falsity of physicalism was already true in newton's boring deterministic classical
universe we already have this you don't need quantum um you know uh indeterminacy and all this kind
i'm sure it adds some cool bells and whistles but already in the in the classical world
and and i mean you know pythagoras and plato already already saw this they they understood
very clearly long before we knew anything anything about cool uh you know quantum physics that uh there
are there are facts that matter for the physical world that do not themselves originate in the
physical world they cannot be changed by anything you do in the physical world there are mathematical
structures that already ingress even into newton's boring uh classical universe so so maybe there's new
stuff um happening with uh with quantum mechanics quite possibly but but but physicalism was was lost
long before we got there i think thank you thank you so much and thank you everybody great questions
and uh thank you for uh for being here yeah if anybody has more questions please email me michael.levin
at tufts.edu i'm happy to talk about this stuff as much as you want thanks so much mike
okay so we have to move to the next to the next speaker yeah all right so those of you who still
had questions like i said save them for the afternoon um so catherine do you want to try sharing
your screen and we can see what's working and what's not make sure you unmute hold on
yeah i'm sorry about this i have a setup so i can do presenter mode but i need a second screen i think
and it's not working today but let's let's just try it and see sure you try it first and if you need
me to run the slides i'm happy to yeah this is what i need to see but i'd rather have you guys just see
the slides can what you're seeing right now uh i don't think you're sharing your screen yet oh duh
sorry a little frazzled this morning i was up all night changing things around to honor everybody's talk
so bear with me here let's see so i see him and i'll try to change
