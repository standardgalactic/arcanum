have you ever wondered why societies sometimes seem to lose their collective minds why seemingly
rational people can suddenly embrace irrational beliefs in masses these phenomena have puzzled
thinkers and historians for centuries this dangerous social phenomenon is called mass psychosis
but before we discuss this consider this quote from the renowned psychologist gustave lebon
the masses have never thirsted after truth they turn aside from evidence that is not to their
taste preferring to deify error if error seduce them whoever can supply them with illusions is
easily their master whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim this sobering
observation sets the stage for our exploration of how entire societies can descend into madness
you probably think that surely the greatest threats to civilization are natural disasters
diseases or external conflicts but what if i told you that according to the famous psychologist
carl jung the greatest danger lies within our own minds jung argued that our inability to deal with
the forces of our own psyche poses the most significant threat to our civilization it's as
if we're our own worst enemies or as the latin proverb puts it man is wolf to man jung considered this
a sad yet eternal truism but when does this wolf-like nature come to the forefront jung observed that it's
most prominent during those dark periods of history when mental illness becomes the norm rather than the
exception in a society he termed this disturbing phenomenon a psychic epidemic in his work the symbolic
life jung writes indeed it is becoming ever more obvious that it is not famine not earthquakes not
microbes not cancer but man himself who is man's greatest danger to man for the simple reason that
there is no adequate protection against psychic epidemics which are infinitely more devastating than
the worst of natural catastrophes it's a chilling thought isn't it so what exactly is a mass psychosis
simply put it's an epidemic of madness it occurs when a large portion of society loses touch with reality
and descends into delusions now you might be tempted to dismiss this as mere fiction but history provides
us with all two real examples consider the witch hunts that swept through america and europe in the 16th
and 17th centuries during this period thousands of individuals mostly women were killed not for any
crimes they actually committed but because they became scapegoats in societies gripped by collective
madness frances hill in her book a delusion of satan writes that in some swiss villages there were
scarcely any women left alive after the frenzy had finally burned itself out or think about the rise of
totalitarianism in the 20th century millions of people embraced ideologies that in hindsight seem
obviously destructive and delusional yet at the time entire nations fell under their spell the results
of a mass psychosis are nothing short of devastating jung studied this phenomenon extensively
and observed that when a society succumbs to madness its members become morally and spiritually inferior
they sink unconsciously to an inferior intellectual level becoming more unreasonable irresponsible
emotional erratic and unreliable but perhaps most terrifying of all jung noted that crimes the
individual alone could never stand are freely committed by the group this explains how ordinarily moral
people can participate in atrocities during times of mass psychosis what makes this phenomenon even more
insidious is that those caught in its grip are often unaware of what's happening just as an individual
experiencing psychosis can't step outside their own mind to recognize their delusions there's no archimedean
point from which those living through a mass psychosis can observe their collective madness so what causes a mass
psychosis to answer this we need to first understand what drives an individual to madness while there are
many potential triggers such as drug abuse brain injuries or other physical ailments we are particularly
interested in psychological or psychogenic causes these are the most common culprits behind mass psychosis
the most prevalent psychogenic cause of psychosis is a flood of negative emotions particularly fear or
anxiety that drives an individual into a state of panic now imagine this panic spreading through a
population like a contagious disease that's the starting point of a mass psychosis when in a state
of panic it's natural to seek relief it's mentally and physically exhausting to remain in such a hyper
emotional state while there are healthy ways to cope with panic such as facing and overcoming the fear
inducing threat another escape route is a psychotic break now contrary to popular belief a
psychotic break isn't a descent into greater disorder instead it's a reordering of one's experiential
world it blends fact and fiction reality and delusions in a way that helps alleviate the feelings of
panic it's a coping mechanism albeit a maladaptive one silvano arietty one of the 20th century's
foremost authorities on schizophrenia outlined the psychogenic steps that lead to madness first there's
the phase of panic where the individual starts perceiving things differently becomes frightened
appears confused and can't explain the strange occurrences they're experiencing this is followed
by what arietty calls the phase of psychotic insight during this phase the individual succeeds in putting
things together by creating a pathological way of seeing reality this allows them to explain their
abnormal experiences arietty calls it insight because the patient finally sees meaning in their experiences
but it's psychotic because it's based on delusions rather than a realistic understanding of the situation
in essence the delusions allow the panic-stricken individual to escape from the flood of negative
emotions but at the cost of losing touch with reality as arietty puts it a psychotic break can
be viewed as an abnormal way of dealing with an extreme state of anxiety now let's scale this up to
a societal level if a flood of negative emotions can trigger a psychotic break in a vulnerable individual
then a mass psychosis can result when a population of vulnerable individuals is driven into a state of
panic by threats real imagined or fabricated but here's where it gets interesting because delusions
can take many forms and madness can manifest in countless ways the specific manner in which a mass
psychosis unfolds will differ based on the historical and cultural context of the affected society
in our modern era one form of mass psychosis stands out as particularly threatening the psychosis of
totalitarianism arthur verse lewis defines totalitarianism as the modern phenomenon of total
centralized state power coupled with the obliteration of individual human rights in the totalized state
there are those in power and there the objectified masses the victims in a totalitarian society a disturbing
transformation occurs the population is divided into two groups the rulers and the ruled both groups undergo a
pathological change the rulers are elevated to an almost godlike status which stands in stark contrast
to our nature as imperfect beings who are easily corrupted by power the masses on the other hand are
reduced to dependent subjects of these pathological rulers taking on a psychologically regressed childlike
status hannah arendt one of the 20th century's preeminent scholars of totalitarianism describe it as an
attempted transformation of human nature itself but this transformation doesn't create a utopia it turns sound
minds into sick ones as a dutch medical doctor who studied the mental effects of totalitarianism observed
there is in fact much that is comparable between the strange reactions of the citizens of totalitarianism
and their culture as a whole on the one hand and the reactions of the sick schizophrenic on the other
the social transformation that unfolds under totalitarianism is built upon and sustained by delusions
think about it only deluded individuals would regress to the childlike status of obedient and submissive
subjects handing over complete control of their lives to politicians and bureaucrats only a deluded
ruling class would believe they possess the knowledge wisdom and acumen to completely control society in
a top-down manner and only under the spell of delusions would anyone believe that a society composed of
power-hungry rulers and a psychologically regressed population could lead to anything other than mass
suffering and social ruin the mass psychosis of totalitarianism has been induced many times
throughout history as juiced mereloo explains in his book the rape of the mind it is simply a question
of reorganizing and manipulating collective feelings in the proper way the method by which the ruling elite
accomplishes this is called menticide which literally means killing of the mind mereloo describes it as
an organized system of psychological intervention and judicial perversion through which a ruling class
can imprint their own opportunistic thoughts upon the minds of those they plan to use and destroy so
how does this process of menticide unfold it begins with the sowing of fear placing the population in
a state of panic that primes them for a descent into delusionary beliefs one particularly effective
technique is the use of waves of terror under this method periods of intense fear mongering are
interspersed with periods of calm but each period of calm is followed by an even more intense spell of
fear and on and on the process goes mereloo explains the psychological impact each wave of terrorizing
creates its effects more easily after a breathing spell than the one that preceded it because people are still
disturbed by their previous experience morality becomes lower and lower and the psychological
effects of each new propaganda campaign become stronger it reaches a public already softened up
while fear primes a population for menticide the use of propaganda to spread misinformation and promote
confusion regarding the source of threats and the nature of the crisis helps break down the minds of
the masses government officials and their lackeys in the media can use contradictory reports
nonsensical information and even blatant lies the more they confuse the less capable a population
becomes of coping with the crisis and diminishing their fear in a rational and adaptive manner
confusion in other words heightens the susceptibility to descend into the delusions
of totalitarianism as mereloo puts it logic can be met with logic while illogic cannot it confuses
those who think straight the big lie and monotonously repeated nonsense have more emotional appeal than
logic and reason while the people are still searching for a reasonable counter-argument to the first lie
the totalitarians can assault them with another in our modern world the means to manipulate society
into the psychosis of totalitarianism have never been more effective smartphones and social media
television and the internet all in conjunction with bots that spread propaganda and algorithms that
quickly censor unwanted information allow those in power to easily assault the minds of the masses
what's more the addictive nature of these technologies means that many people voluntarily
subject themselves to the ruling elites propaganda with alarming frequency mir lu observed this trend even
in the early days of modern technology modern technology teaches man to take for granted the world he is
looking at he takes no time to retreat and reflect technology lures him on dropping him into its wheels and
movements no rest no meditation no reflection no conversation the senses are continually overloaded with stimuli
man doesn't learn to question his world anymore the screen offers him answers ready-made but there's
a further step that would-be totalitarian rulers can take to increase the chance of a totalitarian psychosis
isolating the victims and disrupting normal social interactions when alone and lacking normal interactions with
friends family and co-workers an individual becomes far more susceptible to delusions for several reasons
firstly they lose contact with the corrective force of positive examples not everyone is tricked by the
machinations of the ruling elite and individuals who see through the propaganda can help free others
from the menticidal assault if however isolation is enforced the power of these positive examples greatly
diminishes another reason isolation increases the efficacy of menticide is that human beings like many other
species are more easily conditioned into new patterns of thought and behavior when isolated mirloo
explains this in relation to the work of physiologist ivan pavlov on behavioral conditioning pavlov made
another significant discovery the conditioned reflex could be developed most easily in a quiet laboratory with
a minimum of disturbing stimuli every trainer of animals knows this from his own experience isolation and the
patient repetition of stimuli are required to tame wild animals the totalitarians have followed
this rule they know that they can condition their political victims most quickly if they are kept in
isolation alone confused and battered by waves of terror a population under an attack of menticide descends into a
hopeless and vulnerable state the never-ending stream of propaganda turns minds once
capable of rational thought into playhouses of irrational forces with chaos swirling around
them and within them the masses crave a return to a more ordered world this is when the would-be
totalitarians can take the decisive step they can offer a way out a return to order in a world that seems to
be moving rapidly in the opposite direction but all this comes at a price the masses must give up their freedom
and cede control of all aspects of life to the ruling elite they must relinquish their capacity to be
self-reliant individuals responsible for their own lives and become submissive and obedient subjects
in other words the masses must descend into the delusions of the totalitarian psychosis
mirlu describes this descent vividly the totalitarian systems of the 20th century represent a kind of
collective psychosis whether gradually or suddenly reason and common human decency are no longer
possible in such a system there is only a pervasive atmosphere of terror and a projection of the
enemy imagined to be in our midst thus society turns on itself urged on by the ruling authorities
but the order promised by a totalitarian world is a pathological order by enforcing strict conformity
and requiring blind obedience from the citizenry totalitarianism rides the world of the spontaneity
that produces many of life's joys and the creativity that drives society forward the total control of
this form of rule no matter under what name it is branded be it ruled by scientists and doctors
politicians and bureaucrats or a dictator breeds stagnation destruction and death on a mass scale
so perhaps the most important question facing our world is how can totalitarianism be prevented
and if a society has been induced into the early stages of this mass psychosis can the effects be
reversed while one can never be sure of the prognosis of collective madness there are steps that can be
taken to help effect a cure this task however necessitates many different approaches from many
different people just as the menticidal attack is multi-pronged so must be the counter-attack
according to carl jung for those of us who wish to help return sanity to an insane world
the first step is to bring order to our own minds and to live in a way that provides inspiration for
others to follow it is not for nothing that our age cries out for the redeemer personality for the
one who can emancipate himself from the grip of the collective psychosis and save at least his own soul
who lights a beacon of hope for others proclaiming that here is at least one man who has succeeded in
extricating himself from the fatal identity with the group psyche but assuming one is living in a
manner free of the grip of the psychosis there are further steps that can be taken firstly information
that counters the propaganda should be spread as far and as wide as possible the truth is more powerful
than the fiction and falsities peddled by would-be totalitarian rulers so their success is in part
contingent on their ability to censor the free flow of information another tactic is to use humor and
ridicule to delegitimize the ruling elite as mirlu explains we must learn to treat the demagogue and
aspirant dictators in our midst with the weapon of ridicule the demagogue himself is almost incapable of
humor of any sort and if we treat him with humor he will begin to collapse a tactic recommended by vachlav
havel a political dissident under soviet communist rule who later became president of czechoslovakia
is the construction of what are called parallel structures a parallel structure is any form of
organization business institution technology or creative pursuit that exists physically within a
totalitarian society yet morally outside of it in communist czechoslovakia hovel noted that these
parallel structures were more effective at combating totalitarianism than political action furthermore when
enough parallel structures are created a second culture or parallel society spontaneously forms and
functions as an enclave of freedom and sanity within a totalitarian world hovel explains in his book the
power of the powerless what else are parallel structures than an area where a different life can be lived
a life that is in harmony with its own aims and which in turn structures itself in harmony with those
aims what else are those initial attempts at social self-organization than the efforts of a certain part
of society to rid itself of the self-sustaining aspects of totalitarianism and thus to extricate
itself radically from its involvement in the totalitarian system but above all else what is
required to prevent a full descent into the madness of totalitarianism is action by as many people as
possible just as the ruling elite do not sit around passively but instead take deliberate steps to
increase their power so too must an active and concerted effort be made to move the world back
in the direction of freedom this can be an immense challenge in a world falling prey to the delusions
of totalitarianism but as thomas payne noted during another dark period of history tyranny like hell is
not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious
the triumph it's important to remember that the battle against totalitarianism is not just a physical
or political one but a psychological one the ruling elite understand this which is why they focus so
heavily on controlling the narrative and manipulating emotions to combat this we must become aware of our
own psychological vulnerabilities and work to strengthen our minds against manipulation one way
to do this is through education not just formal education but self-education we must cultivate critical
thinking skills learn to question authority and develop the ability to recognize propaganda and
manipulation when we see it this includes understanding logical fallacies being able to fact check
information and maintaining a healthy skepticism without falling into paranoia another crucial aspect
is maintaining our humanity and connections with others totalitarian systems thrive on dehumanization
and isolation by fostering genuine human connections practicing empathy and refusing to see others as mere
abstractions or enemies we resist the totalitarian mindset we must also be vigilant about protecting our
privacy and personal autonomy as technology advances it becomes easier for those in power to monitor and
control the population by being conscious of our digital footprint supporting privacy protecting
technologies and resisting the urge to trade privacy for convenience we can make it harder for would-be
totalitarians to exert control it's also crucial to support and protect free speech and freedom of the press
these are often the first casualties in a totalitarian takeover even if we disagree with what's being said
defending the right to say it is crucial for maintaining a free society this includes supporting
independent journalism and alternative media outlets that challenge the official narrative furthermore we
must be wary of the creep of authoritarianism totalitarianism rarely appears overnight it often
creeps in gradually each small step making the next seem less outrageous we must be willing to draw
lines in the sand and say no further to encroachments on our freedoms even when they're presented as
being for our own good it's worth noting that art and culture play a significant role in this struggle
totalitarian regimes often seek to control art and suppress creativity because they recognize its power
to inspire and unite people by creating and supporting art that celebrates freedom individuality and human
dignity we can help keep the flame of liberty alive even in dark times in conclusion the struggle against the
mass psychosis of totalitarianism is one of the most crucial battles of our time it's a battle fought
not just in the halls of power or on the streets but in the minds and hearts of every individual the path
is not easy and the outcome is never guaranteed but as long as there are those who value freedom who think
critically who maintain their humanity in the face of dehumanizing forces there is hope in the words of the
philosopher albert camus the only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that
your very existence is an act of rebellion let us then commit ourselves to this rebellion of freedom
let us be the beacon of sanity in an increasingly insane world the choice as always lies with each of us
will we succumb to the comfortable delusions offered by would-be totalitarians or will we embrace the
sometimes difficult but ultimately liberating path of freedom and individual responsibility
the future of our societies and indeed of human civilization itself may well depend on how we
answer this question
