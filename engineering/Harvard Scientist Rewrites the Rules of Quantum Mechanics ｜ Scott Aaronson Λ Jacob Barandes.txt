It is not every day that I see a claim
for a new formulation of quantum mechanics.
That's exciting.
For almost 100 years,
quantum mechanics has splintered physics
into competing interpretations,
each with a different consequence for reality.
In this theolocution, Harvard's Jacob Barendes,
co-director of the graduate studies department,
has developed a revolutionary framework
called indivisible stochastic processes
that suggest there is no fundamental wave function.
He's joined with Scott Aronson
as they dispute other interpretations
like many worlds and Bohm,
as well as discussing,
do quantum computers get their power from other universes?
If so, why don't quantum computers provide speedups
for all problems instead of just a specialized subclass?
In Jacob's view, what actually gives quantum computers
their power over classical computers is indivisibility.
And that's because the class of indivisible processes
is simply larger than the class
of all the kinds of processes used by classical computers.
My name's Kurt J. Mungle,
and I use my background in mathematical physics
to analyze various theories of everything.
Can we finally understand quantum mechanics
without invoking mysterious wave functions,
or are we forever bound to a world
of mathematical abstractions
divorced from physical intuition?
The audience is in for a huge treat.
I've had a preview of the questions you have for one another,
and I'm excited to be hosting you both.
Thank you.
Welcome, Scott Aronson and Jacob Barendes.
Great to be here.
It's lovely to be here.
Thanks for the invitation.
Nice to see you, Scott.
Yeah, good to see you too, Jacob.
Does the benefit of quantum computing
provide evidence for many worlds?
Scott.
I would say that there is a philosophical argument
that, for example, David Deutsch has made, right,
that says that, and this was very closely related
to why he invented the idea of quantum computing
in the first place, in the early 1980s, right,
that says, well, look, suppose that you use
a quantum computer to factor a 2,000-digit number, right?
You know, and Deutsch said this very explicitly,
you know, in the 90s, right?
Suppose you run Shor's factoring algorithm,
and it factors the number, you know,
just vastly more efficiently than we think
it can be done with any classical algorithm.
And he says, you know, if you don't believe
that quantum reality is, in some sense,
it's a vastly larger thing than classical reality,
then where did the computation happen?
You know, where was it done, right?
And so, you know, I think that that does get at,
you know, why quantum computing is so interesting
to many of us in the first place, right,
that it seems like this really, really hard-to-fake test
that, yes, there is some kind of reality
to these abstractions that we're talking about
that do involve these vectors
and this exponentially large space, right?
But now, I would say the philosophical part,
the part where people can reasonably disagree
with each other, is should you describe that
in terms of parallel universes or not?
You know, is that the right language to use
for talking about this vast thing, right?
The problem is that, you know,
what do we mean by something being a different universe, right?
Usually, you know, we mean that it is evolving independently
from us, right?
It is, you know, its own separate thing.
I mean, in the TV shows, in the movies,
there's always some portal or some wormhole
by which you can visit the other universe
because, you know, if there weren't,
then what would be the plot, right?
But somehow, it is separated from our universe, okay?
But the trouble is, if it's separated,
then for that very reason,
we don't see the evidence of it.
You know, like if we do a quantum computation,
then, you know, at the point when two branches,
you know, are really separated,
then, you know, we don't see the interference between them.
We only see, you know, our branch.
And to the extent that you do see the interference,
you know, as you do in Shor's factoring algorithm,
for example, you know,
or other algorithms for quantum computers,
then you could say the very fact
that these things could interfere
means that they never really established
separate identities as parallel universes at all.
They were all just part of one giant
interfering quantum mechanical blob, right?
So I think that that's a philosophical objection.
But I do agree that, you know,
a quantum computation would be dramatic evidence
that, you know, the state of the universe,
you know, is this vastly bigger thing,
in some sense,
than what classical physics posits for it, right?
And that is a huge deal.
Now, you know, I get annoyed
when, you know, people will take
the latest quantum computing experiment,
like what Google did, you know,
with its willow chip this past December.
And they'll say,
oh, you know, this is new, you know,
evidence for the reality of parallel universes.
It's like, no, you know, no, it's not.
It's just evidence that quantum computing works,
like the theory said.
And, you know, if you agreed
with the philosophical argument
that that can only be explained by many worlds,
then you should have believed that
way before this experiment, right?
And if you didn't believe it,
then you still shouldn't believe it.
So it's not like, you know,
these experiments are changing things that much.
But, you know, there is this philosophical argument
that I think is at the heart
of why we care about quantum computing,
why Deutsch invented it in the first place.
Briefly before you respond, Jacob,
I want to know, well,
what would David Deutsch say to your response
about that the universes must be independent,
so how would it manifest in this universe?
Oh, what would he say?
I mean, Deutsch would say that
you don't even need quantum computing
to see the obvious truth
of the many worlds interpretation.
He would say that even the two-slit experiment,
you know, from more than 100 years ago,
you know, where you see interference
between two paths that a photon can take,
even that clinches the case
and can only be explained
by, you know, the many worlds interpretation
and everyone else is just in denial about it.
And then he would say,
okay, but for those who are too dense to see that,
you know, building a quantum computer
may help them psychologically, right?
It may, you know, make it even more undeniable,
but he thinks you don't even need it.
There's some very interesting history here,
and Scott, I'm sure you're aware of this,
but many of the people who are watching may not know.
But Deutsch's development of quantum computing
is really a fantastic example
of how thinking philosophically and foundationally
about physics in general
and quantum mechanics in particular
has borne tremendous fruit.
I agree.
My understanding is the story
is that Wheeler had him sit down at a dinner
with Hugh Everett
when Hugh Everett sort of came back
out of retirement in the 70s.
Yeah, I can almost see the building
where that happened.
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And they sat next to each other.
And at the beginning,
apparently, Deutsch was skeptical or whatever,
but by the end of the dinner,
he was quite convinced.
And just like Scott said,
I mean, it's in the papers.
It's kind of amazing, right?
There's this foundational paper
in quantum computing from 1985.
It's quantum theory,
the Church-Turing principle,
and the universal quantum computer.
And Deutsch is not shy
about citing the Everett interpretation.
It's like in the abstract.
And throughout the paper,
he's like,
and this only makes sense
under the Everett picture.
And he says very clearly
that one of his motivations
for developing quantum computing
is to make just completely clear
that the Everett approach
has to be correct.
What's interesting,
and Scott, you mentioned this,
and this is exactly on point,
the sort of modern ideology
that is dominant among people
who think about
and work on the Everett approach,
and this is typified by books
like David Wallace's 2012 book,
The Emergent Multiverse,
is that you really need decoherence,
meaning the gradual disappearance
of interference effects
between the branches
in order for macro world branches
and distinct universes to emerge.
And that precisely doesn't happen
in the middle of a good quantum computation.
Yes, that's what I'm going to say.
Right, exactly.
But my point is just that
what Scott's saying
is really the standard way
that most Everettians think about it.
So the Everett approach
doesn't really help you
so much with quantum computing
because those other universes,
they don't exist precisely
in the case when they're being used,
so to speak,
for a good quantum computation.
And I'll just say
a couple of things about this.
One is there are a lot of situations
in quantum mechanics
where if you take seriously
a particular philosophical perspective,
at first glance,
it may seem a little bit,
you know, helpful, revealing,
oh, you know,
quantum computers
in some circumstances
can do things more efficiently
than we believe is possible
with classical computers.
And the actual existence
of multiple universes
seems like maybe this is
what gives these systems
their advantage.
But then on further reflection,
it gets kind of strange
because if these universes
are just really there
in some sense,
whether in the microscopic case
where, again,
there's not agreement
that we should be even thinking that way
or in the macroscopic case,
you might think that you can
get speed-ups
in far more circumstances,
that speed-ups
would be far more generic.
As Scott has at the top
of his blog,
right, his tagline,
if you take one thing
away from this blog,
it's that quantum computers
don't get speed-ups
because they're trying out
all the possibilities at once.
And that's very confusing
because if you think
those universes are there,
you might just think
you can get speed-ups
all the time.
It's actually kind of amazing
that you only seem
to be able to get speed-ups
in very special circumstances.
And if those,
so for me,
this is almost evidence
that we shouldn't be thinking
that way.
And Scott,
you put this really beautifully.
I forget when you said this,
but you had this lovely quotation
where you're like,
these other universes
are not quite as real
as actual universes.
They're not quite as,
they live in some sort of,
you know,
intermediate regime
between being real
and being not real.
Horace Terrelson,
who said that.
But yeah,
I mean,
I've been,
you know,
banging my head
against the pedagogical problem
of how to explain
quantum speed-up
for 25 years.
Right.
And,
and,
you know,
I like to say that
like quantum computing
is a weirder resource
than any science fiction writer
would have had
the imagination to invent.
Right.
Right.
It's not just classical
exponential parallelism.
Right.
But,
you know,
it's related.
I mean,
you know,
in order to explain it to people,
usually we say like,
yes,
you can create
this superposition
over exponentially
many possible answers,
but then you get
only this tiny portal
for observing something.
about it.
Right.
You have to make a measurement.
Measurement is a destructive thing
in quantum mechanics.
It collapses the state.
And then your only hope
of getting a speed-up
is to exploit the way
that amplitudes
in quantum mechanics,
being complex numbers,
work differently
from the probabilities
that we're used to,
in particular,
that they can interfere
with each other.
So with every quantum algorithm,
you are trying
to choreograph
a pattern
of interference
where the contributions
to the amplitude
of each wrong answer
are canceling each other out.
They're interfering destructively.
Whereas the contributions
to the amplitude
of the right answer
are all adding up.
They're constructively interfering.
Right.
So that's not a thing
that is,
I mean,
I can say that
if you give me a few minutes.
Right.
But that's not a thing
that is easy to translate
into any pithy English phrase
that we had beforehand.
Right, right.
Well, let me just say
a couple of things about this.
One is,
the use of branching tree-like
graphical structures
is not unique
to quantum computing.
That's right.
If you're teaching a course
in probability theory,
we draw, like,
outcome trees,
probability trees,
decision trees,
all the time
to explain things.
So, I mean,
I completely grant
that drawing, you know,
trees of branches
is a pedagogically
useful exercise.
So I want to then
jump on the point
that you made,
which is that
the key to quantum computing
is the ability
to exploit the fact
that these amplitudes
are complex
and that the different
possibilities interfere
and you can use them
to sort of cancel
each other out.
Interference is this,
you know,
very important property
in getting quantum computing
to work.
So, and actually,
I think that's kind of key
because if you think
it's all about
parallel universes,
you might think
you get speed-ups
all the time
when you realize
that it actually requires
this very delicate use
of interference
then you realize
the class of problems
you're going to be able
to get speed-ups for
is actually not going
to be totally obvious
and will require
a lot of careful thought.
We've been working
on it for 30 years
trying to figure out
what exactly is that class.
Right, right.
You know,
but, yeah.
I mean,
I kind of like
the analogy
between the Everett
interpretation
and just, you know,
Darwinian evolution
where you have,
you know,
these populations
of species
that can interfere
with each other,
you know,
namely,
reproduce sexually,
right,
but, you know,
that's only when
the population
remains, you know,
relatively close
to each other
in its DNA sequence,
right?
Once you have
two isolated
subpopulations
that get far enough
apart from each other,
then they're never
again going to merge,
right?
Then they really
have branched off
into two separate
branches,
what, you know,
biologists would call
two different species
and what in quantum mechanics
we would just call
separate Everett branches.
Yeah, yeah,
it's a lovely metaphor
and very helpful,
especially pedagogically.
Of course,
then the question is
what is interference
and how do you explain
interference to students
if you're not,
you know,
and if these aren't
really worlds,
if they're not really
macro worlds yet
because if they were
well-defined macroscopic
realities,
they would have decohered
and then we can't do
quantum computation
with them.
So, like,
what are these things
we're dealing with?
And there's a kind
of quietism
that one practices.
Let's just not talk
about what they mean,
let's just draw them
on paper and work with them.
And I think
we can do better.
I mean,
we don't have to do better.
If the goal
for somebody
is just to build
better and more
efficient quantum algorithms,
to build quantum algorithms
that can do more things,
I think this is probably fine.
But, of course,
we all come into
thinking about
quantum theory,
quantum foundations,
and philosophy of physics
for a variety of reasons.
And I think
there are definitely
a lot of people
who would like
a more physical picture
that underlies this.
and this is where
my approach
sort of comes in.
And I'm happy to say
a little bit
for those who
may be unfamiliar
with my work
and how it connects
with this power
of quantum computing.
But let me...
Totally on board
with wanting to
understand the world.
Yeah.
And not just
predict the outcomes
of experiments.
Right.
Yeah, yeah.
And then we can talk
about how to do that.
So, Jacob,
before you go on
explaining
your new formulation,
I want to hear
Scott Aronson's
rendition of it.
Yes.
But first,
before Scott Aronson,
before you speak
about Jacob's theory,
in order for Jacob
to say yes or no
to you,
I want you to
tell the audience
then where do you
think this efficiency
comes from
in quantum computing
or where does
the interference occur?
If it's not
these many worlds,
if you're not a believer
in many worlds,
then where do you
personally, Scott,
think the efficiencies
come from?
I mean,
a quantum speed-up,
you know,
really,
if you think about it,
just means
classical slowdown.
Right?
It means that
our quantum computer
can do something
that cannot be done
efficiently
by any classical algorithm.
Right?
And so,
what it really means
is just that
of all of the different ways
that you might have imagined
that a classical computer
could efficiently
simulate this quantum computation,
none of them work.
Right?
And so,
by its nature,
you know,
there's not going to be
just one explanation
for that.
Right?
There might be
a different explanation
for every possible,
you know,
way of simulating
the thing classically.
Right?
It's fundamental.
Quantum speed-up
is a negative statement
at its core.
Right?
None of the classical
approaches work.
And so,
so I think that
the exponential size
of quantum states,
you know,
when we write them down
in the usual way
is part of the story.
The entanglement,
you know,
of the qubits
is part of the story.
If there were an entanglement,
then there would be
a fast classical simulation
because I could just
keep track of the state
of each particle separately
in my classical computer.
The interference
is a huge part
of the story
because if it weren't
for interference,
then I could just use
a classical computer
with a random number generator
and that would do
the simulation.
Right?
So it's really
the combination
of all of these elements,
the, you know,
exponentially large
Hilbert space,
as we call it,
the entanglement,
the interference
that is ruling out
all of the different ways
that you could simulate
this thing efficiently
with a classical computer.
Actually,
you even need
more than that.
There are examples
of quantum computations,
for example,
what we call
stabilizer quantum computations
that have all of those elements
and yet still
they can be efficiently
simulated by a classical computer
for another reason.
Right?
So,
so it's,
but,
but you're,
you know,
if you combine
all of those elements,
exponentially large
Hilbert space,
entanglement,
interference,
then at least
there's a chance
that you're going
to evade
any way of simulating
what you're doing
efficiently
using a classical computer.
And I think
that's really
what's going on.
Okay,
now let's hear
your recapitulation
of Jacob's theory.
And just for
a background
for the audience,
Jacob has
a theory on
or a formulation
of quantum theory,
a reformulation
of quantum theory
that gives an
ontological account
as to what's occurring.
And it's been covered
on Theories of Everything
this channel
at least three times.
And I'll put each
part on screen right now
and the links
will be in the description.

Just so you know,
if you're listening,
it's C-U-R-T-J-A-I-M-U-N-G-A-L.org,
KurtJaymungle.org.
Yeah, so it is not
every day
that I see a claim
for a new formulation
or interpretation
of quantum mechanics.
So, you know,
that's exciting.
You know,
I mean,
I tend to think
that, you know,
the basic options
on the table,
you know,
like Copenhagen
or, you know,
many worlds interpretation,
Bohmian mechanics,
you know,
have pretty much
been around
since the 1950s
with, you know,
minor rebrandings,
combinations,
elaborations since then.
And Jacob is,
you know,
saying he has
something different.
Actually,
when I talked
to physicists
about this,
they said,
oh, yeah,
Jacob Berandes,
isn't he the guy
who has something
that's kind of
like Bohmian mechanics?
But I think
it's not,
I think I understand
better than I did
a month ago
what is going on
and that it's
not quite that.
So basically,
just to back up
a little bit,
you know,
I would say
what Jacob wants
is to,
you know,
give a new account
that reproduces
all of the
empirical predictions
of quantum mechanics.
So he's not going
to change
the experimental
predictions, right?
That's what it means
for something
to be an interpretation
or, you know,
formulation
instead of,
you know,
a new physical theory,
right?
But he wants
to do it
with, you know,
using something
that looks more
like classical mechanics
where you have
particles
that will have,
you know,
or some objects
that will have
just definite
classical configurations,
you know,
such as just
the positions
of particles
in three-dimensional space.
Okay?
And, you know,
and that puts him
in a long tradition
with people
who have tried that,
including Bohmian mechanics.
Okay?
But the difference is
in Bohmian mechanics,
you maintain
the wave function,
the quantum wave function
in your ontology.
So you still have
this, you know,
gigantic wave
of amplitudes,
you know,
just like many worlds does.
Okay?
But then you use
that wave
to guide
the particles
along trajectories,
right?
So you have,
let's say,
particles
that have
some actual positions
in three-dimensional space,
and then those particles
are guided,
they're nudged around
by the wave function
in a way
that's been
precisely constructed
to reproduce
the predictions
of standard quantum mechanics
for what would you see
when you measure
those particles.
Right?
Okay, so that's
Bohmian mechanics.
Now, Jacob,
a kind of interest,
is going to get rid
of the wave function
and not have the wave function
in his ontology,
and he's not going to have
the trajectories
for the particles either.
Not in general,
anyway.
Okay?
What he's going to have
is just, you know,
like in Bohmian mechanics,
you pick a basis,
you know,
so you have
what we call
a preferred basis,
which could mean,
like, positions
of particles
in three-dimensional space
or something like that.
And then at any given time,
you know,
he wants to say
the particles,
you know,
have a real position,
you know,
or, you know,
the system
has a real configuration,
a real state,
in that basis,
even if you don't look.
Okay?
But now,
what he's going to give up on
is trajectories
for these configurations.
Okay?
So in general,
we're not going to be allowed
to ask,
given that the particles
were in this configuration
at time t,
you know,
what is the probability
that they will be
in this other configuration
at time t plus one?
Right?
Or, you know,
sort of,
we're only going to be allowed
to ask that question,
you know,
in the cases
where it would,
you know,
where it would normally
make sense,
right?
When, you know,
in quantum mechanics,
you know,
we would say
that it's in superposition,
Jacob would just say,
well,
you're allowed to ask
at any,
you know,
individual time,
right?
You know,
what is the probability
that the particles
are here
or that they're there,
but you're not allowed
to ask,
given that they're here now,
what is the probability
that they are there then,
right?
And so,
this is what he means
in talking about
indivisible stochastic dynamics.
So,
he wants to reformulate,
say,
you know,
what in the standard picture
would be the Schrodinger equation,
you know,
that governs the evolution
of the wave function
as a differential equation
that is governing
the stochastic evolution
of these,
you know,
this,
this,
this,
this,
what we might call
a hidden variable,
except it's not really hidden,
right?
The,
the,
the,
the classical positions
of these particles.
So,
so he's going to give you
an evolution equation
for that,
but it's not divisible.
In the cases where,
in the standard account,
we would say that
quantum interference
is happening,
you know,
you're not allowed
to ask for
transition probabilities.
You're not allowed
to ask for
the,
the,
the,
the whole path
that is followed
by these particles
or like,
you know,
given that they're here now,
then what's the chance
that they're there then?
It's just all one,
uh,
indivisible,
uh,
uh,
stochastic evolution.
So,
that's my understanding of it
and now Jacob can tell me
what I got wrong.
Thanks,
yeah,
um,
so,
let me just say a couple
of things about this.
The first is,
um,
there is a,
kind of a paradigm
that we all work under.
Uh,
it's a paradigm that,
uh,
I grew up learning about
when I took my university
courses in quantum mechanics.
Um,
you know,
I ended up doing a PhD
in theoretical physics
and we used quantum theory
all the time.
I used a tremendous amount
of,
of quantum theory
applied to fields
and so we learned
quantum field theory
and so,
there's a certain way
of thinking about
quantum mechanics
and thinking about,
uh,
how it's supposed to work
starting from
the textbook axioms,
the so-called Dirac
for Paul Dirac,
von Neumann
from John von Neumann
axioms that you get
from respectively
1930 and 1932,
um,
that's written
in all the textbooks
and these axioms
are,
you know,
quick to summarize.
Every quantum system
has a Hilbert space.
The,
you know,
every system has
a quantum state
defined in some
mathematical terms
either as a state vector
or a density,
some object that lives
in this Hilbert space,
uh,
this object
when the system
is evolving
through time
in a way
where it's not
mutually exchanging
interactions
or information
with any other systems
evolves according to,
uh,
a rule called
smooth unitary
time evolution
which can usually be,
uh,
for some systems
expressed as
a differential equation
that's the Schrodinger equation
and then you have
all these measurement axioms,
all these axioms
about,
you know,
what are the mathematical
objects that represent
the things that we can
observe about the system?
How do we get
probabilities out of
the theory
for those measurement outcomes
that's called the Born rule
and then we're supposed
to collapse the quantum state
uh,
to reflect the result
of the measurement
and give robust
reliable predictions
um,
for,
for subsequent measurements.
That's,
those are the standard picture
and,
and this picture
is built around
the idea of the quantum state.
You know,
there's this paradigm
I call it
the wave function paradigm
that quantum theory
begins by talking
about wave functions
or some suitable
generalization of wave functions
that live in Hilbert spaces
and then we're supposed
to sort of figure out
what we're supposed
to do from there.
When you start
from this picture,
it sounds very complicated
to construct
a different picture
because you start
with all these
Hilbert space ingredients
or like,
well,
we've got a Hilbert space.
Hilbert space
is a kind of vector space.
Vector spaces
can be,
uh,
described using
what are called
different orthonormal bases.
So what you have to do
is you have to pick
an orthonormal basis
for some reason
and then from that
orthonormal basis
you have to do this
and do this
and you have interference
and,
and you have Hilbert space
and,
you know,
and,
and you have the
Schrodinger equation
which has to be
translated back.
I mean,
when you start
from this paradigm
it makes everything
sound very complicated
and you see this
all the time
when you're talking
about,
you know,
different paradigms
for a theory
that from
maybe a newer paradigm,
you know,
a newer paradigm
can look very complicated
when one attempts
to express it
in terms of an older one
or even very difficult
to understand
and there's this whole theory,
this whole story
in the history
and philosophy
of science
about,
uh,
about the incommensurability
of different paradigms.
So let me just,
let me just start
from the beginning,
okay?
I don't believe
that paradigms
really are incommensurable
but,
you know,
that's a separate discussion.
That's fine.
I won't take a stand on this.
I'm not ideological about this.
I'm only saying
that there,
there is in the history
and philosophy of science
this idea
that paradigms
can be incommensurable.
I,
I won't take a stand on it.
Yeah.
What I would say,
Jacob,
is that,
you know,
if you say that,
that this is,
you know,
a new paradigm
for quantum mechanics
and that,
uh,
you know,
uh,
we shouldn't try
to express it
in terms of the old paradigm,
then the task for you,
the next task
would be to explain,
you know,
take all the successes
of quantum mechanics,
you know,
uh,
all the phenomena
that we know about,
you know,
including,
you know,
Shor's algorithm,
Grover's algorithm,
you know,
quantum teleportation
and,
and,
and show how
they have simpler
explanations
in terms of
indivisible
stochastic dynamics,
right?
And what you won't
be allowed to do
when you do that
is say,
well,
just translate it back
into the usual,
you know,
uh,
cat notation,
the usual
Hilbert space picture
and then,
you know,
just,
uh,
invoke this theorem
that says that it has
an equivalent representation
in my picture
because,
you know,
if,
if that's,
you're going to be
your answer,
then,
you know,
you're telling me
that in practice
I should just continue
using the standard picture,
right?
And,
and I should continue
to think in terms of it,
right?
If you want me to switch
to thinking in,
in,
in terms of a different picture,
then you have to show me
how all the,
the specific successes
of quantum mechanics
that I care about
actually are simpler
to explain,
present in terms
of that new picture.
So let me say a couple
of things about that first
and then I'll get to,
yeah.
So one of the things
I'm going to do
is explain what this approach
is on its own terms.
Um,
but of course,
one of the,
the,
the important things
about this approach
is that it leads to
an ability to reconstruct
the standard axioms
and the Hilbert space picture
in its regime of validity
and say a little bit
about why it has
this sort of limited
regime of validity
and how,
how one might extend that.
But I'm not saying
to be super clear,
right?
I'm not saying
that we should stop
using the Hilbert space picture
any more than,
um,
you know,
if you want to,
uh,
you know,
study a problem
in classical physics
using the action angles
formulation,
or you want to do
Hamlet-Jacobi theory,
or you want to help
yourself to canonical
transformations
or canonical perturbation theory,
um,
or one of a million
other things
that you might want to do,
visualize trajectories
in phase space,
you're going to use
the Hamiltonian phase space
reformulation
of classical physics.
So if someone comes along
and says,
oh,
you know about Hamiltonian,
the Hamiltonian phase space
formulation,
you've got Qs
representing positions
or some generalization
of positions
and Ps representing
some generalized notion
of momenta,
the so-called canonical momenta,
and you have this
phase space picture
and you've got
the dynamics,
the equations
that describe how things
evolve according to
Hamilton's equations of motion,
and you have these
beautiful symmetries,
you have this,
like,
ability to do changes
of canonical variables,
these so-called
canonical transformations
that can scramble
what the whole picture
looks like,
you know,
and someone comes along
and says,
actually,
I think that there's
a physical picture here.
The thing you're describing
is an object moving around,
you know,
maybe it's stuck to a spring
or at a pendulum,
you know,
and the person says,
well,
okay,
that's a useful picture
that's helpful,
but will it help me do
canonical perturbation theory?
Will it help me
do action angle variables?
I would say,
well,
no,
we have this beautiful
Hamiltonian framework
for doing that,
you should use that still.
Or another example is,
we have general relativity,
so general relativity,
this is,
I've been teaching
general relativity
for 10 years,
but when we do
orbital calculations
in, like,
you know,
sending spacecraft around,
we still use
the Newtonian paradigm,
it's still very useful.
I understand the point,
Jacob,
I mean,
but general relativity,
at least,
you know,
there is some class
of situations
where,
you know,
this new language
is better,
right?
So I think,
in this case,
you at least have to show
that there is some class
of problems,
of quantum mechanics problems,
that are better treated
using your new formulation
than using the old one.
Or else,
other people could justly say,
then what is the point
of learning it?
Or even can only be treated
using your formulation.
Right.
Right, right.
So,
let me start with that,
that quick,
I want to get to
explaining what it is,
but let me just quickly
jump to that,
okay?
Okay.
So,
if what you're doing is,
again,
developing algorithms
for quantum computing,
I don't think,
there's no obvious sense
in which this gives you
the ability to do anything
differently from what
you would do
in the old paradigm.
The tools that we have
are extremely good
for these situations.
You're studying
tabletop kinds of systems
where the Dirac-Vind-Emmen
axioms work really great,
but those are not
the only kinds of systems
that physicists
are interested in.
So,
physicists are interested
in applying quantum mechanics
in astrophysical situations
to early universe cosmology,
and people are trying
to apply quantum mechanics
in the context
of quantum gravity.
They're trying to do
quantum mechanics
applied to black holes.
They're trying to do
quantum,
you know,
and now you're in situations
where the Dirac-Vind-Emmen
axioms are very ambiguous
about what you're supposed
to be able to say.
And this is where
I sort of cut my teeth.
I mean,
again,
I did my PhD here at Harvard
in high-energy
theoretical physics.
These are the kinds
of problems that I studied,
and I was often very confused
about,
you know,
when we were legitimated
in using the textbook version
of quantum theory.
And again,
I wasn't the only one.
I mean,
we would routinely run
into situations
in which people would say,
well,
can we do this particular thing?
Does this make sense?
We have the sort of
nonlinear dependence
on this or that,
and what's going on
with black holes?
And people were genuinely
confused about how to apply
quantum theory
to these situations.
But these are situations
that are different
from what you'd find
in tabletop experiments.
It'd be like saying,
why do I need
general relativity on Earth?
Newtonian gravity
works fantastically.
Well,
there are systems
that are beyond Earth
where we may need
a better theory
because things get
more extreme.
Let's agree
that if you could
say something new
about quantum gravity,
that would be great.
Right?
No argument there.
Now,
if we think of you
as, you know,
you are sort of
hawking a new product
at the foundations
of quantum mechanics
bazaar,
right?
Well,
okay,
the quantum gravity
theorists
are potential customers,
right?
I am also
a potential customer,
right?
I am in the market
for even just
a reformulation
of existing
quantum mechanics
that would help
in coming up
with new
quantum algorithms,
right?
Or understanding
for which problems
quantum computers
will give us speed up
and for which they won't.
If someone can give me that,
that's great.
I'll buy it.
Right.
But,
so,
there's like a lot of things
that one might want to do
with reformulating
quantum theory.
One is,
you know,
the existing approaches
that we have,
the existing,
if you want,
formulations,
interpretations.
I honestly,
I know that the terms
don't exactly mean
the same thing
and there are some people
who really like to
be very precise
about what they mean,
but I'm happy
to call this
a formulation interpretation
that doesn't,
that doesn't bother me.
Okay,
but that,
at some point,
that might actually
be the crux.
Like,
are you making
a new ontological claim
or are you just giving
a new mathematical
reformulation?
But both.
So,
it'll be very clear
for everybody,
it's both.
There's both
an ontological statement
about what is actually
out there
and also,
sort of a new
mathematical formulation.
And,
you know,
to be clear,
like,
when Paul Dirac
introduced the path
integral in,
you know,
his paper in 1932,
Lagrangians and quantum mechanics,
he was just curious
how Lagrangians show up
in quantum mechanics,
this classic idea
of Lagrangians,
because the theory
at that point
had been developed
only in the Hamiltonian
formulation.
And it took 10 years
before Richard Feynman
came along
and incorporated this idea
into his PhD thesis,
then six more years
in 1948
in reviews of modern physics,
and when he spelled out
the idea for a broader
physics audience.
And even then,
he said in the paper,
there's nothing you can do here
that you can't do
using ordinary methods.
It took decades
for people to realize
that there are situations
in which you would never
want to do things
in the canonical
Hamiltonian formulation,
in particular,
things like Yang-Mills theories,
right?
And the standard model
is formulated in the Lagrangian
path integral formulation
for very good reasons.
Sometimes ideas do take a while
to come to fruition.
And another good example
is David Bohm's work.
So decoherence goes back
to David Bohm's work
in 1951.
He was doing foundational,
trying to understand
foundational questions
of the measurement process
in his textbook,
Quantum Theory,
from 1951.
And in chapter 22,
he studies the measurement process
and famously
in section 22.8,
Destruction of Interference
in the Process of Measurement,
he introduces this idea
of how decoherence works.
You know,
and it takes decades
for that eventually
to become a major part
of how we think
about quantum computing,
right?
I mean, decoherence timescales
are now a thing
that people just talk
about constantly.
Things do take time,
but you have to begin
with a new idea.
And I think it's just interesting
when you have a new idea
that isn't obviously
wrong or inconsistent.
So the first thing
I'll just say is,
like, certainly if there
are any inconsistencies
or problems
with this new formulation,
that's, you know,
fair game.
But if the only thing
is to say, well,
I don't know what
to use it for yet,
I think that's actually
pretty good.
We don't always know
what to use things
for initially.
In that case,
let's delve into the idea.
So I still want to know,
did I get anything
importantly wrong
in my summary
of what you are asserting?
So, okay.
One, you made a comment earlier,
does this thing
make any new predictions?
Yes.
I'm going to come
to that point.
Okay.
Another, you talked about
whether this thing
has any trajectories in it.
I'm going to come
to that point again.
All right.
And, but broadly speaking,
I think that if you're
starting from the
Hilbert space picture
and trying to explain
like backward
how to go from
the Hilbert space paradigm
if you want
to this paradigm,
I think broadly speaking
your picture is right.
But I think for people
who are hearing this
for the first time
it sounds very complicated.
So let me just explain.
I mean, I'm just thinking
of someone who already
knows quantum mechanics
and what is the quickest route
to get them to understand
what you were asserting.
Right, right, right.
But again, it'd be like
starting with a Hamiltonian
phase space formulation
and saying we're going
to pick a canonical frame.
I mean, what choice do we have?
We have to meet people
where they are.
Right, absolutely.
Well, the choice is,
you know, to, you know,
for new people coming
to quantum theory, right,
who aren't, you know, yeah.
But, okay, so let me,
let me just start
from the beginning.
I listed all the
Dirac von Ohm and axioms.
They involve all these
exotic ingredients.
We're not going to do that.
Here are the starting assumptions.
Here are the axioms.
The first is that a physical system
has a configuration
and that configuration
comes from some menu
of configurations
that we like to call,
if it's a nice continuous
set of possible configurations,
a configuration space,
not a physical space.
And this is,
this is,
we call this the kinematical
part of the theory
and it's very similar
to what you would do
in a classical theory.
Classical theory,
you begin by picking
an appropriate set of
or space of configurations
that you want to use
to model the system
in question.
If you want to study particles,
you would pick arrangements
of particles in space.
If you want to do fields,
you would,
you know,
consider,
you know,
configurations of field intensities
localized at places in space
or,
you know,
a discrete system
like in a computer,
you would pick,
you know,
arrangements or patterns
of on and off switches
and memory registers
or whatever.
So that's,
that's model dependent.
You pick what you need
for the model you want to do
and that's the first axiom.
We just pick a set
of configurations.
Okay.
The second is the dynamics.
The dynamics means
the dynamical laws,
the mathematical laws
that describe how configurations
are supposed to change.
And,
you know,
in,
you know,
physical theories up till now,
you know,
under this sort of
Laplacian paradigm,
the idea is we have
some kind of differential equation
that takes our present configuration
and then tells us
later configurations
in some smooth way,
usually in the language
of some giant differential equation.
We don't do that.
The,
the new dynamical postulate
is there's just this
family of conditional probabilities,
right?
This collection
of conditional probabilities
of the form,
given that the system
is in such and such configuration
at this conditioning time,
this is the conditional probability
the system will be
in such and such configuration
at a particular target time.
Conditioning time
has to be a special time,
right?
We'll talk about,
yeah,
that's what we'll talk about.
So this is a sparse set
of conditional probabilities.
Yeah.
They're not,
they're not completely comprehensive.
They're not,
you know,
they don't exist
for all conceivable,
you know,
things you might,
you know,
pick for target
and conditioning times.
In particular,
the conditioning times
are a little bit special.
That's what makes these
a sparse set
of conditional probabilities.
And because they're special,
these processes
are called indivisible processes.
And indivisibility
just means
that there's like
a failure of iterativeness.
You can't just
take some process
over some amount of time
and just
act repeatedly
with some map
or rule
that then gives you
for each success of time
because that would assume
that every single time
is a time
at which you can
restart and condition on.
If you give up
that assumption,
you have
a simpler collection
of conditional probabilities.
These
processes
entered the research
literature
in 2020
in a preprint
by Simon Mills
and Kevin Modi
in just sort of
a throwaway comment
in figure six
in their paper,
which was a beautiful
review article
on classical
and quantum stochastic
processes
that I highly recommend.
It's on PRX quantum.
It's,
you know,
available for everyone.
It's,
you can also get
the archive version
of you or whatever.
But,
you know,
and then ultimately
it was published,
like I said,
in PRX quantum.
That was next year.
So 2021,
this is like
a relatively new idea.
It hasn't been explored
by people who work
in statistics
and in the theory
of stochastic processes.
These processes
are not Markovian.
So Markov processes
are processes
that have this nice
iterative behavior.
Broadly speaking,
I mean,
it's a little bit
more subtle than that.
But,
but,
but even,
you know,
when people have considered
traditional
non-Markovian processes,
like in the textbooks,
when people think
about non-Markovian processes,
they imagine
these very,
very intricate structures
with these towers
of higher and higher
order conditional probabilities
that are all
different from
each other.
They get very,
very complicated.
They're very difficult
to formulate and specify.
And that's why people,
when they can,
typically try to write down
Markov processes.
These indivisible processes
are even simpler
than Markov processes.
They fail to be Markovian,
not because they're so,
they're more complicated
than Markov processes,
but because they're
actually simpler than them.
They're so simple
that people just kind of
stumbled over them
and didn't realize
that they were,
that they existed.
And I'm,
you're talking right now
with people who work
in the theory
of stochastic processes
and they're like,
oh yeah,
well,
that's actually
like a new idea.
And new ideas
are always exciting,
right?
I mean,
when you realize
there's something
pretty simple
that's been sitting around
and people didn't notice it,
that,
I mean,
there's new mathematics
to be done,
there's new ways
to think about things.
And remarkably,
you know,
so you might have just thought,
well,
if there's this new
kind of process
that's simpler
and more general
than the processes
we've been dealing with,
can it do anything?
Does it have any applications?
And it turns out
it appears to be
exactly right
to give you back
quantum theory.
So again,
the two assumptions
are configurations
and configuration spaces
and the dynamical laws
are these,
these sparse
conditional probabilities
that generically
will fail to be
indivisible.
Sorry,
will generically fail
to be divisible.
They're called
indivisible processes.
And then there's
the mathematical correspondence,
a map,
that's very analogous
to the map
between a classical
Newtonian system
and the Hamiltonian
phase space formulation,
which is this very
mathematically
abstract formulation
with all these symmetries
and all these
calculational tools.
And that correspondence
is called
the stochastic
quantum correspondence
and it lets you go
between the two pictures.
So,
you know,
once you avail yourself
of this map,
you can just systematically
reconstruct all the axioms.
But now you know
where they sort of come from
and you get these
very beautiful
ways to understand
where some of the weirdnesses
of quantum theory
come from.
So let me take
for example,
the complex numbers.
When you want to use
this to cast
a quantum correspondence,
what you find generically
is that it only works
when the complex numbers
are introduced
at this step.
So,
or some algebraic structure
that is algebraically
equivalent
or isomorphic
to what we call
the complex numbers.
and that's actually
really nice.
It's really close.
Like,
you need
some negative numbers.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Right,
right.
But you could imagine,
for example,
representing the complex numbers
with like two by two matrices
or something.
Sure.
But my point is
the stochastic process
you start with
doesn't have
any complex numbers
in it.
It's written
in the language
of just ordinary
old-fashioned
probability theory,
right?
There's no Hilbert spaces.
It's just systems
moving around
and the probabilities
are old-fashioned probabilities
that have all the usual rules
of old-fashioned probabilities.
And when you want to write it
in this Hilbert space picture
what you find
is that
in most cases
the complex numbers
are necessary
to write down
that description.
And so this gives
a very satisfying explanation
of why we need
the complex numbers
in quantum theory.
I do think
there's something nice
that is going on there
like in
the axiomatic
reconstruction
of quantum mechanics
which is another thing
that people have,
you know,
Lucy and Hardy
and many others
of,
you know,
Giulio Chirabella
have tried
for many years
you know,
which I would think
of as a somewhat
different game
from interpretation
of quantum mechanics.
Yes, yes.
I should say
that those approaches
for example
Hardy's approach,
right?
He has this
and I recommend
this to everybody
who's listening
because it's
a beautiful paper.
It's quantum mechanics
from five reasonable axioms.
But these approaches
are explicitly
instrumentalist.
They're part
of this larger idea
called
generalized
probability theories.
The other GPT,
the original GPT,
which is just
to treat quantum theory
as kind of
an instrumentalist device
in which agents
or observers
do measurements
on things.
So these are not
intended to be
physical interpretations.
So this,
to be super clear,
this is a very different
kind of a picture.
But let me go further,
right?
One question people have
is like,
you know,
why interference?
Why linear?
Where do these features
come from?
And interference
is this very bizarre,
as we were talking
about earlier
in this conversation,
it's something about,
if you take kind of
a many worlds-ish
kind of attitude,
we've got different realities,
but they're not really
different realities yet
because they're not
macroscopic
and they haven't
decohered yet.
You know,
and somehow
they're complex numbers
and they can cancel
each other out,
right?
But like,
what is going on physically?
There's kind of no
like clear physical picture
here.
But because you have
this correspondence now
between Hilbert space,
this Hilbert space story
and this stochastic story,
you can translate
back and forth
to get a physical picture.
And if you translate
interference back
to this picture,
what you find
is that it's literally
just the indivisibility.
If you take a process
and you start
from some conditioning time
and go to some target time,
you'll get some statement
about the conditional probabilities
the system will end up
where it does.
If you,
by hand,
just demand
that we can slice
this process up
and write down
the kind of nearest
approximate divisible
counterpart to this process,
you just divide it
by fiat
at this intermediate time
and then try to treat it
as a process
with a division in the middle,
you'll get the wrong answer.
But what's fascinating
is that when you compare
the correct answer
with indivisible dynamics
to the wrong answer,
you just subtract the two,
subtract the predictions
of the one from the other.
The formula that pops out
is exactly
the formula for interference.
So interference
now has an interpretation.
It's just
if you want to go
to a formalism,
not an indivisible
formalism
with laws
that are sort of
hard to apply,
but you want to go
to this nice,
beautiful,
clean,
smooth Hilbert space
formalism
in which you can
do time evolution
in steps,
you use unitary
time evolution,
it's nice and divisible,
it looks Markovian,
then the cost you pay,
the indivisibility
doesn't go away,
it manifests
as this very abstract,
very confusing
kind of interference.
But now the interference
has like a physical meaning
that it didn't have before.
I mean,
that had better
be the case,
right?
Oh yeah,
of course,
it better be the case.
Reproduced quantum mechanics.
Absolutely.
But let me get to
your question about-
I think we're pretty much
on the same page
about what is being asserted,
you know?
Right.
And if we are,
then I can now explain,
I think,
very crisply
why,
you know,
as an interpretation
of quantum mechanics,
why I am not
buying this product.
I have two points
to make first
that may change
your view on this.
So let me get to these.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
So the first thing
before I,
let me just say,
because you're reconstructing
the axioms of quantum theory,
you don't have to go through
one at a time
and check that
every single thing comes,
oh, you can,
and some people do that.
So you've made a couple of things.
One is this question
about there are no trajectories.
I want to be a little more
precise about this.
Okay.
The statement here
is that there are,
it's not that we're saying
that there's no trajectories.
What we're saying
is the theory
doesn't supply you
with a precise description
about what trajectories
are taken.
So, you know,
the system at any given moment,
there is a probability distribution
for the configuration
of the system.
And these probabilities,
these distributions are,
where the system is,
is changing.
In some circumstances,
you can make
conditional probabilistic statements
about where the system will be.
In other cases,
you can't.
But this isn't to say
that the trajectories
aren't there,
just that we don't have
the tools from the theory
to tell us what they're doing.
Now, you could say
this makes them unobservable,
and then we can run
into a discussion about
should a theory
have unobservables in it.
Let me pass this over to Scott.
Yeah.
Stay on this.
Are you committed
to the existence of trajectories
even if you can't calculate
their probabilities?
Yes.
You are?
Yes.
Okay, so you say
that there really are trajectories.
Yeah, the system
is really doing things.
It's just that your theory
doesn't tell you
their distribution.
Correct.
Yep.
Okay.
That is different
from what I thought.
Excellent.
I thought that you were
denying the existence
of the trajectories.
No, no, no, no, no.
There are trajectories.
The system is following
some path,
but we just don't know
what it is.
If you had a God's eye view
and could see
the entire universe unfolding,
you'd see all these
zany trajectories.
You wouldn't need probabilities.
You wouldn't need quantum theory.
But we are limited,
epistemic limited beings.
Okay, but it's not just
that your theory
doesn't tell us
the trajectories.
It's that within
the empirical framework
of quantum mechanics,
it would seem
we cannot know them,
even in principle.
Yep.
You know,
literally only God
can know them.
That's right.
I take the experiments.
Experiments seem to indicate
that when you do a measurement,
you get one result.
The result is obtained
probabilistically,
and there are certain things
that we cannot know,
like trajectories of systems.
And my approach just says,
nature says that.
Why don't we just believe nature?
As you know,
on Theories of Everything,
we delve into some
of the most reality-spiraling concepts
from theoretical physics
and consciousness
to AI and emerging technologies.

Thanks for tuning in
and now back to our explorations
of the mysteries
of the universe.
Nature says that?
Why don't we just believe nature?
Okay, so then that is
a very key difference
from Bohmian mechanics,
let's say, right?
Where Bohmian mechanics
will just say,
you know,
among all the choices
that we could possibly make
for distributions
over trajectories
that would reproduce
the predictions
of quantum mechanics,
we are going to make
this one particular choice,
right?
Right.
So Bohmian mechanics
means, you know,
you're committing
to a specific choice.
And one of the central objections
that I have always had
to Bohmian mechanics
is, well, why that choice?
Why not a thousand
other equations
that I could have also
written down
would have been
empirically indistinguishable
from that one, right?
Agreed.
And so, you know,
you're saying,
okay, well,
there is some,
you know,
distribution over trajectories,
right?
There is some,
you know,
as there would be
in Bohmian mechanics,
and you're just going to be
completely agnostic
about which.
Right.
So to be clear,
we're not providing
a probability distribution
over trajectories.
That's kind of the thing.
You're not.
You're not.
I understand that.
Excellent.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, but this isn't,
I mean,
so one objection
one can always raise
if you're not supplying
individual trajectories.
And I did a lot of early work
in the modal interpretations.
Okay.
In the modal interpretations,
the failure to provide
trajectory information
can lead to
ontological instabilities
that are very severe,
where like macroscopic systems
can fluctuate between
like cat alive,
cat dead,
cat alive again,
in ways that are
sort of uncontrollable.
And, you know,
so what you don't want
is for the inability
to specify trajectories
to bleed into
macroscopic systems.
But what you can show
is precisely because
as systems get bigger
and bigger,
they have more and more
and more of these
division events
that just arise
from the interactions
of the environment
that for macroscopic systems,
you get a really nice,
clean evolution.
You know,
when you work in terms
of collective variables
and appropriately coarse-grained
degrees of freedom,
you find that macroscopic systems,
they do move
in very predictable ways,
even though way down deep
their individual
elementary particles
or elementary constituents,
whatever they are,
are behaving in ways
that can't be assigned
within the theory
specific trajectory.
So it's very important
that we close the gap
between kind of
the unpredictability
of the trajectories
for microscopic things
and the emergence
of nicer trajectories
for big things.
And this is something
I'm very sensitive to,
again,
because of my early work
in the modal interpretation.
So I just wanted to say
something quickly
about the trajectories
and I'm glad
we touched on that.
The other thing
I wanted to say
was this question
about does this
make different predictions?
So the Dirac-Vein-Alman axioms
are ambiguous
about what should happen
when you've got
very large systems
that you want to treat
quantum mechanically, right?
This is the heart of-
Systems include us.
They include us,
but Schrodinger's cat,
Wigner's friend experiment,
right.
And so there's just
an ambiguity
and a particular-
I mean, in some sense,
as long as the cat
or the friend
or whatever
is external to you,
right,
as long as you are willing
to treat it
as just a collection
of atoms,
you know,
even an enormous one,
you know,
evolving by Schrodinger evolution,
then it is unambiguous
what to do.
But if you yourself
are part of the system,
I mean,
I think that is when
the empirical problem arises.
I mean,
you know,
I think a way to put it,
and I have this flowchart
that maybe Kurt
can attach,
but I call it
the Wigner's friend flowchart.
And it's just basically like
in the Wigner's friend
thought experiment,
which again,
if people haven't heard about,
the super quick summary
is there's now two observers.
Very important,
there's now two.
Hugh Everett,
who first introduced it
in the literature
in his long-form thesis
in 1956,
he phrased it as two observers.
You know,
in the simplest case,
one observer,
Wigner,
is outside of a box
that is sufficiently sealed
for the duration
of the experiment
that we can pretend
that nothing leaks
out of the box
or goes in.
And then Wigner's friend
is a second observer
inside this perfectly sealed box
along with some quantum system
and some kind of superposition
that this Wigner's friend
is going to measure
or do a measurement process on.
And the question is,
now that we have two observers,
there's this ambiguity.
Do we activate the collapse
or the measurement axioms?
Do we not activate them?
Do we activate them
for everybody or for nobody?
And you can just construct a detail.
When I have this conversation
with Wigner's friend,
people tend to dodge and weave,
right?
I'll say one thing
and then they'll go one way.
I'll say that.
But if you just draw
a whole flowchart
and just say,
here's the flowchart.
Here are all of your options.
You have to pick one.
Yes or no to this.
Yes or no to that.
Yes or no to this.
Yes or that.
And all of them end
at some kind of either problem
or they end
at some kind of interpretive sense.
If you believe
that Wigner's friend
on the inside,
in fact,
really does collapse
the quantum state
by this measurement,
then you run into
the measurement problem,
right?
Head on into
what counts as measurements,
what doesn't count as measurements.
If you,
you know,
believe that collapse happened
but it wasn't because
of the measurement,
then you're talking about
a dynamical collapse
or some other theory
about why collapses happen.
If you don't believe
that the overall wave function
is collapsed,
then either
Wigner's friend
did in fact have a result.
There was in fact a result
despite the fact
that it's not reflected
in the overall wave function
and that is by definition
a hidden variables approach.
And a lot of physicists
implicitly take this approach
if they don't want to be
men and welders.
They're like,
well,
we just have to be perspectival.
There are different perspectives.
You know,
Wigner on the outside
assigns one wave function.
Wigner's friend on the inside
has a definite result
but this is literally
a hidden variables approach.
Or you deny
that there was in fact
a definite outcome
and you're either embracing
that more than one outcome
has ever happened
and that's kind of
a many worlds type ontology
or that nothing happened.
That without,
that Wigner's friend on the inside
somehow didn't yield
anything at all.
And then you're embracing
some kind of anti-realism
which is going to be
radically self-undermining.
And those are your options.
You have to pick something.
And I know that,
you know,
you can sort of try to not
but it's just sort of
staring you right there.
I am explicitly embracing
the option
that the overall
well on the Hilbert space side
we would say
the overall wave function
and the stochastic side
we would just say
that there's just
ongoing indivisible
stochastic process happening
that isn't broken.
That's what's going on
for the overall system.
And at the same time
Wigner's friend
did have a definite result.
So you can think of this
if you want
as a hidden variables approach
although as Scott pointed out
these variables
are certainly not hidden
to Wigner's friend
and they're not extra
or additional variables
because the wave function
is not a physical object.
These variables
are the only things there are.
So I'm explicitly embracing
that part of the flowchart
and that makes a prediction
different from the Dirac-Venomen
axioms
which just either
run into the measurement problem
or are ambiguous
about what's supposed to come out.
For the benefit of listeners
I think we should say
that the trouble
with using the Wigner's friend
thought experiment
to get predictions
is that at the end
of the experiment
Wigner's friend
doesn't actually have a memory
of what happened
which we could use
to test this prediction.
So by the time
it comes to
we ask the friend
at the end
what did you experience
and then we write it down
and we publish it
in a journal
then we all know
how to do the calculation
for what the friend
is going to say
is it going to follow
the usual Born rule
of quantum mechanics
unless there's
some dynamical collapse
thing going on
or something of that kind
but otherwise
you're just going to see
the same
quantum mechanics
that we've known
for a hundred years.
If there's any
empirical difference
it can only be
in what Wigner's friend
is experiencing
while the experiment
is underway.
But once it's done
they've got no memory of it.
Just for the benefits
of the viewer
I'm going to place
the image that Jacob
was referencing on screen
and then I also want
to bring up that
I asked you Jacob
the last time
hey what's the difference
between Wigner's friend
experiment
or thought experiment
and Schrodinger's cat
except the cat
is now a friend.
Yeah they're basically
the same thing.
It's just a question
of like is this
are we worried
about just a large
system being
placed in superposition
are we worried
about the fact
that it's alive
or are we worried
about the fact
that it's conscious
and that like
in some sense
we could be it.
It sounds like
it's just that cats
can't usually report
experimental findings
is the trick.
You can just sort
of heighten
the dramatic stakes
by going from
like just a really
large object
to a cat
that's meowing
you know
to a friend
who you could
actually talk to.
A cat that can
take data and report
it would be
Wigner's friend
basically.
Someone wrote
a hilarious comment
which said
no Kurt you're wrong
because cats are
never a person's
friend.
Well that's
clearly wrong.
Yeah I don't think
that's true at all.
I think we can agree
on that.
I don't think that's true
or that cats
never treat humans
as their friend
something like that.
Well I mean
that's like
I guess how we know.
I mean
cats can be friendly
but on their own terms
that's the difference
from dogs.
Right.
Let me just quickly
say about this comment
about we all know
it would happen
actually we don't
know it would happen
and the reason
I say that is
according to the
Drak von Omen
axioms
if you read
the axioms
one way
then there in fact
is overall
unitary evolution
the whole apparatus
evolves
as far as
Wigner on the
outside is concerned
there's no loss
of coherence
and we can do
in principle
interference experiments
or even do
reverse unitary
and reverse the
system to where
it started
but the Drak von Omen
axioms
they say that
when a measurement
is done
then things collapse
and if you take
that seriously
then you can't
do those operations
you can't do
interference experiments
on Wigner's
on the box
you can't undo
the procedure
unitarily
and so this is
the ambiguity
and I think
what you're
basically saying
is
which is what
most physicists
do is
we're going
to resolve
that ambiguity
in favor
of maintaining
unitary evolution
but that
strictly speaking
goes outside
the Drak von Omen
axiom
so when a physicist
says this to me
they're like
we don't need
all this philosophy
we don't need
quantum foundations
you know
but in the Wigner's
friend thought experiment
we're going to take
this prong
of the fork
they're explicitly
saying that
they're now
outside of the
boundaries
of the Drak von Omen
axiom
they're making
a claim
that goes beyond
the axioms
and then as far
as I'm concerned
they're already
halfway there
right
like once you
agree that the
Drak von axioms
are ambiguous
or incomplete
or insufficient
for this experiment
well then
then you're
you're on my
you're on my
playing field
this is
now we just have
to give
an account
that's consistent
of when we're
allowed to do this
and when we're
not supposed to do
this
or justify it
if the Drak von
axioms are not
available anymore
if we've gone
beyond them
then we need
new axioms
right
because if you're
outside of your
axiomatic framework
you're just
flying around
in the void
you need somewhere
else to stand
and all I'm saying
is that we should
have another set
of axioms
that would allow
us legitimately
and honestly
to be able to
make the statement
that you just made
so the audience
is here
and has been
watching since
the beginning
and knows
Scott is in
the market
Scott is a
working quantum
mechanic
who actually
wants to buy
from you
Jacob
he just wants
to make sure
that you have
something that's
worth buying
but he wants it
so now Scott
probably has
some objections
like I would
buy from you
Jacob
but A, B, and C
so what is it?
Yeah so at some
point in this podcast
I did want to say
you know why
I think I am not
currently buying
this product
you know
I might revisit
it in the future
if it
you know
and I'm very
happy for Jacob
to hook this
product to other
people
but I can explain
why you have not
closed the sale
with me today
okay
and the reason
is you know
if you are telling
me that you
know there are
you know
particles that
you know have
real positions
in space
and now you're
also telling me
that those particles
have trajectories
right
but the trajectories
are unknowable
by us
right
you know
you can only
from quantum theory
you can only get
this indivisible
stochastic dynamics
right
that just
sort of tells you
you know
you know
we're not allowed
to ask
right
so for example
if I am Wigner's
friend in the experiment
I cannot use this
to predict
you know
given that I am
having this one
experience at one
time
then what is the
probability
that I will have
a different experience
two seconds
from now
right
I can't actually
use it for that
you know
it is unknowable
by me
right
well
guess what
that's what
standard quantum mechanics
told me
it told me
it is unknowable
by us
you know
and
I feel like
at that point
I might as well
just say
that you know
what is knowable
what is within
the ambit
of physics
to talk about
is the wave function
which is what
you know
what
most views
of quantum mechanics
have been saying
for a hundred years
right
like I haven't
sufficiently improved
over that
right
you know
for me
you know
to say
for let's say
in the double slit experiment
to say that
you know
we can improve
over
you know
the
just having a wave function
where there's some
amplitude
for the photon
to go through
the first slit
and some amplitude
to go through
the second slit
you know
it means
saying something like
okay
well
really the photon
goes through
one slit
or the other slit
and I can tell you
the path
that the photon
will take
right
which is exactly
what the Bohmians
you know
claim to do
right
if you're not
going to say that
if you're just
going to tell me
well these
indivisible
stochastic dynamics
give you the
probability distribution
over where
you'll find
the photon
if you were
to measure it
at any
intermediate time
right
but you know
if you don't measure it
at the intermediate times
then you know
it could be
jumping around
in some way
that's only known
to God
well I feel like
you know
that's what
standard quantum mechanics
already told me
right
it already told me
how to calculate
the probabilities
if I measure the photon
at any specific time
and it told me
that you know
if I don't make
the measurement
then I don't get
transition probabilities
right
so you know
just sort of
metaphysically asserting
that you know
there is this basis
in which transition
probabilities exist
and I can't know
what those transition
probabilities are
you know
I can't know
what the distribution
over trajectories is
it just
it just feels like
an ontological
commitment
that is not
paying rent for me
you know
it is not
sufficiently improving
you know
I have a very
strong belief
like I do want
to know
what is really
out there
in the world
you know
I am not
an instrumentalist
right
but I want
to fit
my ontology
as tightly
as possible
to what is
actually observable
or what is
at least
in principle
observable
right
because I think
the history
of physics
has given us
so many examples
where people
confuse themselves
by you know
let's say
you know
reifying
you know
things like
in general
relativity
the coordinates
right
or the choice
of gauge
you know
things that
don't actually
make a physical
difference
you know
the global
phase of the
wave function
right
and you know
and again
and again
the right answer
has been
try to
just cut out
from your ontology
things that are
not observable
even in principle
right
have an ontology
that is as
you know
tightly fit
as possible
to the set
of all things
that could
in principle
be observed
and you know
whatever my
reservations
about the
many worlds
interpretation
and I do
have reservations
about it
but at least
it tries very
hard to do
that
right
it tries to
say look
you know
the wave function
is the encoding
of everything
in principle
that's observable
so that's what
we're going to
take as our
ontology
full stop
it is the
wave function
and if we
don't have to
add anything
additional to that
then we're not
going to do that
you know
and Bohmian
mechanics of course
does try to add
something additional
you know
and it makes
it tells a very
specific story
right
and of course
you know
one can then
object
well why that
story
as opposed to
a hundred other
stories
but at least
it is a story
right
at least
you know
there's a
there's a clear
story that we
can stare at
and poke at
and see if we
like it
right
now I feel
like we are
adding additional
ontology
without adding
a story
that goes
that goes
with it
in Jacob's
view
and you know
like that
is a thing
that you can
do
but you know
I don't see
that I'm going
to get something
from that
that is worth
the price
of admission
at least
at least
not for me
not right
now
but you know
I would say
go in peace
you know
if this
helps
for quantum
gravity
that would be
awesome
and that would
certainly
be one reason
to take
another look
if this
gives new
insight
into you know
quantum information
protocols
or quantum
computing
that would
certainly be
another reason
for me
personally
to take a
look
and I feel
like you know
until something
like that
happens
that I'm just
going to say
you know
I pass on
this product
go in peace
so I have
a couple
of points
to make
about that
so just
first a couple
of like
technical
asides
at one point
you said
well
Wigner's friend
on the inside
knows the result
but then doesn't
know what he's
going to be doing
in two seconds
from now
that's actually
not right
because
you know
the whole
the measurement
that Wigner's friend
does generates
a division event
and the division
event is a place
at which you can
then make
conditional
probabilistic
predictions
from that moment
so the
scenario
that I had
in mind
implicitly
is that
let's say
Wigner's friend
is in a
superposition
of two
mental states
and then
we do
a Hadamard
operation
on that
you know
so we do
some
interfering
operation
or in your
terms
some
indivisible
operation
that maps
us from
one superposition
to a different
one
and then
the issue
is that
you know
in normal
quantum mechanics
we would not
get transition
probabilities
that's the
scenario
that I would
that's fine
right
exactly
but for
you know
Wigner
or you
or anyone
doing
measurements
like
regular life
you're gonna
be able
to make
those predictions
and those
comport with
what we see
okay
so
I understand
that
I mean
let me
let me
get to a couple
real life
is pretty
decoherent
yeah exactly
but let me
let me now
get to a couple
a couple
of the
of the
items you
brought up
yeah
and let me
just say
first of all
before we
even get
started
not everybody
has to agree
that this is
the way to go
I'm not
selling this to
you personally
Scott
although it would
be lovely
if you
if you liked
it
we're all
looking for
different things
right
like I said
and you know
when you're
teaching quantum
mechanics
and we just
sort of
snow over
students
we stupefy
them by saying
here are the
axioms
and the students
look on
gawking
and they're just
like Hilbert
spaces
linear algebra
density
matrices
self adjoint
linear operators
you know
POVMs
and you know
you render them
in a state
where they can't
even like
even be able
to ask questions
about why
I only introduce
those things
as needed
but you know
I mean
so of course
I'm also in the
market for better
pedagogical ways
of teaching
quantum information
you know
to students
I would love that
but it sounds like
even if I believed
in your
you know
philosophical commitments
it sounds to me
like I would still
have to teach
the students
about Hilbert spaces
and unitary
transformations
and all those things
because how else
are they going to
you know
do the calculations
agreed
but there's a difference
between saying
I've got forces
in Newtonian mechanics
that push on things
and then through
like a sequence
of mathematical
transformations
I can turn that
into the Hamilton
equations of motion
or the principle
of least action
and then
by contrast
showing up
the first day
and just saying
Hamilton's equations
of motion
or a principle
of least action
with Hamiltonian
I mean
like there's a total
pedagogical difference
there but
let me put all that aside
so
let me
also
so let me
add
add one other
point
which I think
is important
you know
this old joke
right
that
these two
campers
and they hear
a bear
and one of them
starts running
and the other one
starts putting
their shoes on
and the person
is like
what are you doing
you can't outrun a bear
and the person
is like
I just have to
outrun you
I'm not proposing
here
that this
interpretation
or formulation
is going to
satisfy everybody
and I'm not saying
that it's necessarily
the final word
but we don't even
know if quantum theory
is the final word
right
I mean
if we're trying
to develop a theory
of quantum gravity
it's possible
that quantum theory
will have to be
modified in some
even more profound way
than is
that is specified
by this approach
but the question is
is this at least
an improvement
over the other
interpretive or
formulations
that we have
and I have a clear
set of reasons
why I think
that is the case
so if someone
is coming to me
and saying
we've got enough
interpretations already
why do we need
another one
I'm just gonna
sit back
and sit on many worlds
or I'm gonna
recline on
Bohmian mechanics
or I'm gonna
recline on
Copenhagen
or whatever
what I'm telling you
is that those are
not true safe harbors
right
they're giving us
a false sense
of security
here is a list
of criteria
that I would argue
are required
of any good
theoretical framework
in physics
or formulation
and certainly
for quantum mechanics
even apart
from any aesthetic
judgments
or preferences
one is the thing
has to be
empirically adequate
right
it has to
make predictions
the predictions
have to agree
with what we're seeing
that's just the first item
for you know
all the kinds of systems
that we're interested
in quantum mechanics
so empirical adequacy
is the first
the second is
it shouldn't be vague
you know
if someone asks you
a question
and they just sort of
dodge and weave
and they're vague
and you know
I don't know
what we could say
but we kind of know
when we see it
we'll use our expert intuition
like that's
that's vagueness
the third is
it shouldn't make
it shouldn't be
unambiguous
in making predictions
for certain kinds
of systems
that while maybe
practically difficult
to study
in principle
one could study
and this is again
like macroscopic
type systems
like the Wigner's
friend set up
there should be
at least a schematic
in principle
story to be told
about how the classical
world is supposed
to emerge
it doesn't have to
I mean obviously
getting all the precise
details is going to
be very difficult
it's very difficult
to you know
do all the details
and explain how
even classically
you know
classical deterministic
kinds of dynamics
emerge from
classical
Cisco mechanics
but there's at least
like a schematic
story about how
that's supposed
to work
and the final thing
is it shouldn't
depend on a long
list of what I call
SMHs
speculative metaphysical
hypotheses
or ad hoc
extra empirical
axioms
in order to get it
off the ground
a long list
of epicycles
like those are the
things that I think
we should reasonably
require
and my view
is that none
of the interpretive
approaches we have
meet those minimal
requirements
right
and I can explain
in detail
why each of them
doesn't
Bomi mechanics
has proved
very very hard
to generalize
beyond systems
of fixed numbers
of finitely many
non-relativistic particles
so it's proved
very difficult
to use it
to understand
how quantum field
theories are supposed
to work
in the standard
model
our best
theory of
the fundamental
interactions
is written
in terms of
quantum field
theory
in particular
Bomi mechanics
has a great deal
of difficulty
handling what
are called
fermionic
quantum field
theories
which don't
have traditional
configuration spaces
of the kind
that Bomi mechanics
would want to
help itself to
Bomi mechanics
pick up a new
evolution rule
even if it's
a stochastic one
you may have to
pick a preferred
reference frame
or things like that
that's what people
do
here's maybe
the core
of my objection
right
I feel like
Bomi and mechanics
has all these
problems
because it tries
to make a
concrete commitment
right
and you're avoiding
that just by not
making a commitment
to what are the
trajectories
right
as soon as you
made that commitment
then you would have
the same problems
as Bomi and mechanics
yeah
which but
so you're right
Bomi mechanics
attempts to
write down
like very carefully
written down
complicated
some would argue
gerrymandered
stochastic dynamics
in these sorts of
situations
this is the work
of people like
Sheldon Goldstein
and so forth
who've tried to
generalize this
when they need
preferred reference
it turns out to be
super duper duper
complicated
and it looks very
sort of
frankly ham-fisted
right
yeah I agree
I agree
they have a clear
target
to replicate it
that is not the
product for me
either
right
but I mean
look
Jacob
once you
have told me
now that you
are committed
to the existence
of trajectories
you know
even if
we can't
you know
know their
distribution
in principle
you know
now
actually
your view
sounds
more similar
to Bomi and
mechanics
than I thought
going into
this conversation
but it feels
to me
like BOM
minus minus
you know
it is
you know
it is BOM
except you're
taking away
this specific
commitment
about the
guiding equation
and you're
saying you know
who knows
which you know
yes you can
do that
but you know
you know
like I even
would have
you know
would have
known before
that that was
an interpretive
option
that was on
the table
even though
I wouldn't
have phrased
it in terms
of indivisible
stochastic
dynamics
yeah
so let me
just say
earlier on
when you
mentioned
BOM
mechanics
you talked
about the
physicality
of the
pilot wave
I should
just note
that when
BOM introduced
BOMian mechanics
in 1952
he did take
the pilot wave
to be a
physical object
he's very
clear about
that in
his papers
but
and there
are still
BOMians
who take
that view
but
I mentioned
Shelley Goldstein
but Goldstein
Durr
Zange
you know
they've
they've
embraced
since the
90s
a view
of BOMian
mechanics
in which
the wave
function
is not
a physical
object
but it's
an expression
of what's
called
nomology
it's a
it's a law
like expression
which actually
brings quantum
mechanics
in some ways
back to its roots
when Schrodinger
introduced his
undulatory
or wave
mechanics picture
he built
his wave
function
out of
Hamilton's
principal functions
which are
an expression
of a certain
kind of law
like thing
basically
he took
the Hamilton
Jacoby
function
stuck it
into the
phase
of a
function
he called
that his
wave
function
and so
in a way
that's
sort of
bringing it
full circle
there is
a sense
in which
what I'm
doing
like the
nearest
the least
squares
approximation
I'm doing
from existing
interpretive
frameworks
is that
it's most
similar in
some ways
to this
nomological
view
of
Bohmian
mechanics
but without
the preferred
foliation
of space
time
without a
particularly
gerrymandered
set of
laws
the laws
are simpler
without the
kiling equation
specific commitment
of what are
the trajectories
which to me
was the
sort of
distinctive
feature of
Bohmian
mechanics
that you
make this
commitment
you're just
taking that
out
and saying
there are
some
trajectories
it is
unknowable
what they
are
okay
okay
what this
gives you
is simpler
laws
and also
greater
generalizability
because now
you can
apply this
to basically
any kind
of a
system
so the
ability to
generalize
it is
useful
but let me
actually
say something
else here
so you
have this
paper
from 2004
is quantum
theory
an island
in theory
space
but in this
paper
you're like
could we
have modified
any of the
features of
quantum theory
to look for
a different
theory
could we
have for
example
written down
a quantum
theory that
didn't use
the complex
numbers
could we
do a quantum
theory where
we modify
this feature
or that
feature
or this
feature
and what
I love
about that
paper
is
you know
you're
you're not
taking for
granted
that nature
has bequeathed
unto us
this particularly
you're imagining
maybe there
could be a
different kind
of a theory
out there
and it's
worth
trying to
see where
we can
generalize
quantum theory
in anticipation
of the
possibility
that maybe
we'll have
an experimental
result that
will require
generalization
of quantum
theory
there are only
so many
things you
can do
when you
begin
from the
Hilbert space
formulation
if you
do too
much
or you do
something
that's
because the
problem is
the Hilbert space
formulation has
this very
delicate
connection
to empirical
measurement
probabilities
you have to
go through
a sequence
of steps
and through
the Born
rule and you
get probabilities
out and if
you just
say I'm
just going
to take
a hatchet
to the
axioms
the Hilbert
space the
direct
von
axioms
just play
around with
them you
get almost
immediately
nonsense
right you
get probabilities
that don't add
up to one
or negative
stuff that
doesn't make
any sense
because you're
risking damaging
this very
delicate bridge
or link to
probability
theory if you
start from a
different axiomatic
place arguably
simpler and fewer
axioms that are
more straightforward
to explain to
the newcomer that
phrase an old
fashioned probability
theory there's no
longer a link you
need to get to
probability theory and
you could imagine
generalizing the
theory in ways that
would have been
difficult to imagine
starting from the
Hilbert space
formulation and you
know I agree very
much with the spirit of
what you were doing in
that paper I I
believe in it one
advantage to
reformulating a
theory in terms of
different axioms
especially axioms
that are that are
less abstract and
fewer in number and
little less delicate
with less delicate
connections to things
like probability
theory is that we
have greater
flexibility to
consider varying
them and and
constructing more
general theories and
I think that's an
interesting thing to
do if you're a
student watching this
and wondering I'm
maybe I'll work on
some interesting
project what can I
do here's an
interesting thing to
do how can we
generalize starting
from this new
starting place I
was I was about to
ask you I mean can
you make good on
that on that idea I
mean yes I can
imagine it but can
you starting from
stochastic dynamics
give me any example
of something that
looks like quantum
mechanics but is not
quantum mechanics
yes yes okay
here's one example
I'll give you a
couple but tell me
yeah one example is
these uh dynamic
these sparse
conditional
probabilities um
you know are only
conditioned on one
time right they're
conditioned on one
time one of these
division times
one generalization
would be is there a
theory in which we
can condition on two
times is there a
theory in which can
condition on three or
more times these are
now describing theories
that where the it's
not clear the
stochastic quantum
correspondence works
the same way you
don't necessarily get
the standard Hilbert
space picture now
arguably you can do
tricks there's all
these like tricks where
you can take a non
Markovian model with
conditioning on multiple
times and write it in
some bigger way um so
it's possible that
there's some way to
write this still in the
usual Hilbert space
formulation but you
might not so so
you're just putting
this out as an open
question yeah open
question okay this is a
thing we work on and
there are a lot of these
open questions right you
could I wouldn't even
know how to ask this
question the Hilbert
space point of view
right um and uh yeah
so that's that's you
know one example I
want to say a couple a
couple of quick other
uh notes from what you
said um so one is this
question about should the
theory be phrased in
terms of things that uh
you know are uh uh
object more objective
you know should we have
ingredients that we
can't like know what
they are there's this
long-running question
about the role in place
of unobservables in a
physical theory should a
physical theory contain
unobservable things um
and I I know you
don't subscribe to
crass operationalism here
which is the statement
that you know the only
things that are
physically meaningful
right are the things
that we can have some
procedure or operation
to go and implement or
measure or work with um
all of our physical
theories at some place
or other contain
unobservables that play
some important role I
would like to believe
that the moon is there
even when right yeah I
would also and and it
would be nice to have a
justification for
believing that even even
if you know because
again from drach von
neumann there's no it's
ambiguous but the moon is
there which is like a
problem on the other
hand you know the global
phase of the wave
function of the universe
you know uh if I have an
account where it's not
there then um I'm not
sorry to see it go right
yeah but it's because it
wasn't observable even in
principle but Scott it's
worse it's worse than that
so um now I I know that
if I if I were to ask you
this you'd probably you
know uh not you know
commit to this but there
are a lot of people who
are committed to the idea
that the objects in the
Hilbert space picture uh
wave functions maybe apart
from global phase um you
know and and and you know
these sorts of ingredients
are like physical things in
some sense that we should
ascribe some notion of
physicality or ontology to
them um but the the problem
is there's actually this
larger set of of uh of of
gauge transformations in
quantum mechanics that
actually as far as I can
tell only goes back to
1999 in a philosophy paper
by Harvey Brand he's at
University of Oxford um and
uh it's called aspects of
objectivity in quantum
mechanics and Kurt you can
link to it because he does
this on the very first page
sure he's a philosopher and
he identifies on the first
page a large set of gauge
transformations that hold
for all quantum systems you
can think of these gauge
transformations as a
generalization of a change
a unitary change of basis
these are gauge
transformations in which
you're changing the basis
differently at different
times so in the
differential geometric
language which maybe not
everybody watching this
will be familiar with but
those of you some of you
may know you can think of
a quantum mechanical system
evolving in time as a
bunch of Hilbert spaces
strung together like you
know when you're stringing
together uh um you know
popcorn on a string or
something like that right
each each Hilbert spaces is
a fiber stuck to the string
and this string is time
is just we call it a zero
plus one dimensional
manifold it's just time
and there's a Hilbert
space stuck to all the
strings and we can imagine
doing an independent
unitary rotation on each of
the different Hilbert
spaces this corresponds in
somewhat more conventional
language to doing what's
called the time dependent
unitary transformation we we
act with a completely
arbitrary time independent
unitary transformation on
the quantum system and you
might go well but that's
not that doesn't keep things
invariant in quantum
mechanics what are you
talking about but it
actually turns out that um
that it does so you can
look at the beginning of
this of this paper um it as
long as all of your self
adjoint operators that
represent observables
transform in a particular
way just a so-called
similarity transformation under
the unitary and the
Hamiltonian transforms as
what's called a flat gauge
connection um and again
this is all actually written
out in in in in harvey's
paper although he doesn't
use all this terminology
but that's what it is
anyone who works in
non-abealing gauge theories
would immediately see that
the Hamiltonian transforms in
this very characteristic way
the theory is exactly
invariant now what's weird
about this and i know this
is getting very technical
but but this is a technical
objection to try to take
Hilbert space object
seriously is that it means
that state vectors can be
infinitely remapped
however you want and any
trajectory in a Hilbert space
that you thought was
encoding some kind of
invariant information about
the system can be mapped to
literally any other
trajectory by these these
time-dependent unitaries
well it's clear that we
can't we can't reify the
actual numbers you know in
some particular
representation which is
tied to our choice of
basis and so forth but i
don't take any many
worlder for example or
anyone who believes in the
reality of the wave
function to be saying
anything quite that naive
right well but it's it's
tricky then because then
you have to get into the
details of exactly what's
being proposed so when i
talked to some of the
yeah okay kurt i'm sorry
kurt you wanted to yeah
let me make this simpler
for everyone yeah so
jacob you're in the
showroom you came here
with some some clunker
card that you you want to
trade in okay and you're
looking at the options and
someone's coming up to you
his name is jacob and
he's this also jacob okay
yeah got it sexy gentleman
with this great shirt and
you're like i'm not just
gonna be wooed by your
smile jacob so okay let
me hear about the
benefits and then jacob's
trying to sell you and i
also want the audience to
not take anything away from
if scott you you don't end
up buying from jacob by the
end of this podcast i mean
that'd be foolish most
people have to look at a
car or whatever seven times
before they make a
purchase yeah yeah no i
mean i look look i've
already decided i'm not
buying at this point i'm
happy i'm happy to chit
chat some more but okay the
point is that there are
two ways to go about
selling one is to talk
about your own benefits so
jacob of your car the
other is to talk about the
detriments of the
opponents so scott you've
come in with a car you've
also said you're not an
instrumentalist you're not
just caring about going from
point a to b you want to
know what's going on under
the hood so jacob is is
saying that okay whichever
car all the other cars here
will give you some accounts
as to what's going on under
the hood some actually won't
but the ones that you're
interested will give an
account they're giving a
false account or an
account that when you look
actually under the hood it
it disappears into dust so
firstly scott what is the
car that you're going to
drive away from here what is
it that you're committed to so
that jacob can then say okay
well let me compare my
approach to that directly i
should actually say i stopped
driving years ago i didn't
like it i i just i walk or i
take ubers my wife is a good
driver right so you know so
you know so it's all the it's
it's it's it's different cars on
different days right and it's
and it's and it's similar in
quantum mechanics i would say
right i mean i i i know i know
how to think like a many
worlder uh you know i and and
if you wanted me to like you
know have a uh uh an and and
an ontology that you know would
just you know uh uh uh uh the
uh uh uh that was as simple as
possible then i would say you
know uh uh it's going to look
like a wave function that is
evolving by unitary
transformation and you know the
the hard part of course is how
do i get out of that you know my
subjective experience right which
is you know related to uh how do
i get probabilities you know out
of this uh deterministic picture
uh but you know at that point i
feel like that's going to be
entangled with uh you know haha
entangled no pun intended yes
yeah yeah yeah with with like uh
you
