a specter is haunting europe and the united states the specter of judith butler um judith butler is
one of the great public intellectuals um of our age you'll see where i'm going with that uh one
of the great public intellectuals of our age who has inspired uh particularly i guess younger
generations i don't know if we can still throw millennials in there uh millennials go up to about
43 now i mean i'm a geriatric millennial the recent respect of judith butler is we're talking
you know we obviously talk a lot on this channel about the rise of the far right of fascism
and judith butler has become one of the great better of the far right movements in europe
and the united states which i would say something to be pretty proud of um
last time i interviewed you was four years ago and a fair bit has happened since then
um i want to say a fair bit i think the general descent into hell um has been pretty steep
um and has particularly you know in the last two years become acute i would say
we're gonna talk later on we'll talk about palestine and we'll talk about trumpism in general
you're you've written who's afraid of gender really brilliant book is now on paperback everyone do go
and get yourself a copy we'll talk about that um but the reason you know you've been at the forefront
of talking about questions of gender for so long and i think when we talk about say trumpism 2.0 and
trumpism 1.0 if that's possible what's definitely shifted is transphobia the anti-trans backlash has
become particularly fervent i was in the us for the elections and sitting i go i went from state to
state in the rust belt and you would hear these from a british perspective quite jarring political
ads because we don't have them here where they would just often go in hard on transphobia you know
i'd be in pennsylvania i'd be in north carolina i'd be in michigan wisconsin what do you think's
happened there why has this become it was already there don't get me wrong it was there
what has happened why do you think this has become it's it's on steroids now yes um well i think
there are maybe two points one is um it's been a very live issue at the world congress of the families
and various international church conferences for a very long time in fact um the uh anti-trans but
also anti-gender movement and they are just they're overlapping but not always the same um started off in
the uh 90s with the vatican uh making various uh pronouncements against gender gender theory gender
ideology and it moved through latin america so you know if i am a problem for the right i was a problem
for the christian right in latin america way before i i became a problem um uh in in europe or indeed in in
the u.s um and when i say i'm a problem it's not really me it's whatever i stand for with and numerous
other people um uh namely the study of gender or the theory or various theories of gender or gender studies
or whatever is meant by gender um i want i wanted just to say that um in uh 2017 and 18 trump made
efforts to uh say have his health and human services department say that um uh um one's gender has to
be the sex that one is assigned at birth and he failed at that point because there was too much
conflicting legislation there were um judicial decisions that allowed for gender especially in
relationship to sex discrimination and that um you know his his own department said we can't make this
happen and in fact uh the supreme court in a uh relatively um uh uh unadvertised decision um clayton v bostock
decided that well sex when we talk about sex and sex discrimination we might mean the sex assigned at birth
but we might also mean a sex assumed in time by an individual um and whether one is discriminated
against on the basis of the first or the second sense of sex it's still discrimination and it's sex
discrimination and that allowed at least potentially for trans people who are discriminated against
in employment or elsewhere in life um to make claims under the current sex discrimination law in the
u.s that they have suffered sex discrimination so interestingly enough the ca the legal category of sex
expanded to accept gender meaning whatever the the lived experience uh uh of of sex might be um uh as a
legitimate part of sex and so um uh trump now has a problem because uh his supreme court and indeed um neil
gorsuch who is one of his appointees uh authored this decision which is much more open-minded and um accepting of
of of of of new sex assignments than trump himself so even in the anti-gender ideology extremism executive
order that was issued on january 2nd there is a little proviso like the government must guard against
misapplications of that particular supreme court decision so he's seeking to undermine his own supreme
court appointees maybe we can see the beginning of a certain kind of vision i think many people from
their church communities especially right-wing christian ones i'd guess predominantly evangelical
in the u.s but also some right-wing catholic um congregations have been learning for some time that
gender is an ideology a false way of seeing things that's dangerous for children their children are either
being indoctrinated or they're being seduced or they're being converted so social contagion yes or
you send your kid to school and they come back trans or you you know you spent a huge amount of money
in the u.s to send your kid to college and then they come back trans and this is what education is
doing so it's anti-education it's anti-gender but it also has a massive fantasy that people who teach
gender or think about gender are imposing uh a doctrine that they're doctrinaire they're indoctrinating
or that they're seducing or converting or seeking to um interfere with children in ways that are
radically unacceptable and both of those are clearly lies but they are lies that are extremely um believable
by uh people who have anxieties about well what is this gender thing and are they taking my sex away
and what are they doing to my children so all their fears some of them quite intimate and some of them
quite political about the future of the world get condensed into this thing called gender or sometimes
migrant right which is another you know conflated idea that point that point about children i mean in in
in the 1970s this was the i guess the key attack line when it came to the backlash against the gay
rights movement people obviously feel very visceral about their children you can see why this becomes
the point of attack but anita bryant who recently died who was i guess very much one of the leaders of
the anti-gay rights movement of that era at the time one of the most popular women in the united states
um and the name of her campaign was save our children and she she said when in response to
gay right she said what about children's rights we're like we're a children's rights movement
and so it's interesting because history doesn't always repeat itself but as the cliche goes it does
often arrive yes it does and of course the paradox is that the trump administration is now um
and and the british uh government are denying children the right to gender-affirming care
so who's harming the children and you know which church has been uh molesting children for decades
um and being exonerated for having done so i mean who's hurting the children if we really want to
to try to figure out who's denying them the capacity to read books taking books out of
libraries no you may not learn about gay and lesbian lives you may not understand
what trans is you may not even read to come up with a viewpoint of your own um anything on gender
because gender is being defunded or gender books being taken out of libraries um that are that are
publicly funded whose whose health care is being denied whose education is being denied
who's being denied a loving and supportive environment to figure out who they want to
be in life and you know that's that's the right wing what they say to us to both you and i i suppose
on this is um we look we are trying to save children for the likes of you and this is expert i mean when
i in fact was in the united states a commentator said this to me quite passionately to say the least you
you know that you supported what is an experiment on children this is uh um mutilating children
obviously buying into various myths about um gender affirming care i mean in in britain you're you're
on in practice waiting lists for for many many years you don't have the sorts of medical procedures
they're talking about before the age of 18 anyway and and normally you're you're years and years and
years and years on a waiting list until you get any form of gender forming care nonetheless that's what they
say how do you respond to that which is you you have brought this terrible experiment on children
and we're protecting children from these extreme ideological um you know threats to our kids well
first of all i don't know mutilation is a very strong word but if i were to use it and let's see if
i can i would say that denying health care and uh a capacious education to children is a form of
harming them or possibly even mutilating them um so uh or insisting that they remain in the gender
assigned at birth or insisting that they grow up heterosexual or insisting that their sexuality take the
form of form of heterosexual marriage and then and only then reproduce i mean all of these constraining
and repressive norms um are are are mutilating to to children to young people who are trying to find
their way and whose whose lives depend on departing from those norms right who who are gay or lesbian or
non-binary or bisexual or um who are who are intersex and don't fit into the binary categories never did
or or or maybe do on their own accord and in their own way um but um to deny health care to pathologize
sexuality to threaten to de-ratify gay lesbian marriages or parenting rights as maloney is trying to do
i mean all all of this is a mutilation of other people whether they're children young adults or um
or adults themselves this is a a mutilate mutilating exercise of state power on the bodies of people who
should be free to experiment as they need right it's the freedom to experiment that we're actually
trying to safeguard we're not experimenting on them i mean i don't know anybody in a gender
studies class who says okay everybody in here you have to be gay everybody in here you have to be
trans or everybody in here you have to read this book and agree with every proposition that's not
what happens people rise up and argue there's huge conflicts and they storm out and they come back and
you know this paradigm that paradigm this is like a raucous exercise of open inquiry this is not um
indoctrination during the presidential election of the united states um a prominent individual had
a pop at both of us let's put it that way i resent having to talk about them i normally just ignore
um because i resent um in britain in particular discussion about an entire minority becomes a
psychodrama about children's book author and but basically during the during the election in on the on
the election night itself i was in new york uh i wrote one tweet in which i said the u.s secondary
models boss wages for most working people are stagnating for decades you either have an answer
that someone else will but the best kamala harris could muster was i'm not trump that didn't work
and then i said i'd go back to my hotel in new york with a muslim pakistani american cab driver who
voted for donald trump because in quotes the prices were too high under biden that was their
misrepresented because that tweet was taken in isolation as though i was sneering at the cab driver which
obviously wasn't but jk rowling in response uh which is the children's author i'm referring to
um quote treated uh sorry it had a picture of an image about how uh um how the guardian will stand
up to four more years of donald trump which she took off the garden website and she said oh let me
guess emotive long-form pieces from owen jones complaining that american taxi drivers aren't
reading enough judith butler yeah you saw that i saw you asked about it the there was an advert in
america which was um kamala um come out sorry donald trump is for you uh kamala harris is for they them
and it's like that's what this is tapping into what's your response to that
um well i'll tell you one thing um i'm worried that at least some part of the democratic party the
centrist part that's unwilling to really understand their failure as a failure of a connection to the
working class okay that part of the democratic party
it says various things that indicate that gosh we should have been harder on trans people we should
have expressed more pathologizing hatred for them or we should have had stronger military presence at the
border or um shut out more people or started to deport more than we did um so one one i'm changing
the topic just a little to say that one response to comments like jk rowling's is to say oh my god
what were we do what were we thinking to support trans kids or to think um that trans people have a
right to live and breathe without fear of violence or discrimination and that they're entitled to legal
recognition and proper health care oh my god you know why why would we think such a thing we should
they should be deprived of all those basic rights and their autonomy should be undermined and we should
in fact be denying their very existence then we'll win then we'll win and it's like but who who would we
be if we were to win on that basis we would have lost all principle and all commitment to equality justice
autonomy basic values that um that any decent political party should be adhering to so i mean
rowling in my mind um and maybe i'm right maybe i'm not but uh she imagines that trans issues or gender
issues are elite issues that come out of left-leaning uh journalism or urban elite left-leaning
educational institutions so um and even though she doesn't dissociate herself from certain aspects
of the left she thinks that there's a kind of elitism and what would i say uh fraudulence or
insensitivity on the part of those of us um who would point out trans people are also part of the
working class and in fact they are increasingly part of the working class as they lose jobs or get
disavowed by their own families and don't have access to whatever intergenerational wealth there
may be trans people denied health care are also on the street among those at least in the u.s who are
have no chance of health care or who are dependent on services that are woefully inadequate
um in other words all of these anti-trans bills are having massive economic and social effects on
trans people and gender non-conforming people and non-binary people on intersex people like
stripping them of their rights that i mean that is what we're talking about we're talking about rights
stripping which is happening in relation to trans people especially trans youth migrants international
students who arrive at a public protest for principled reasons right those those researchers who are
trying to reverse climate catastrophe or figure out ways of regenerating this earth i mean to to strip
these folks of their rights or their capacities to do their job is um is to um it's not only to
undermine democracy but it's to augment state power so the real question is why would jk rowling
put herself on the side of those who are increasingly authoritarian who are against freedom who are
against autonomy who are against equality and who believe that rights stripping is the way to restore
a proper social order now her proper social order is you know two sexes only two sexes everything else is
fraudulent everything else is made up or nefarious well why not accept the complexity of human life why
would jk rowling rather augment state power clinging to the idea of binary sex
even when it means that she is actively supporting authoritarians putin loves her trump is effectively
citing her and her group of trans exclusionary feminists in the anti-gender ideology extremism
executive order right he's saying that gender ideology is something that threatens women and that the state
now intervenes to protect women against gender ideology she she want that protection she wants to augment
state powers telling us what our sex must be what our sexuality must be what our intimate associations
must look like in order to get legal recognition it's anti-feminist it's anti-lgbtq i plus it is um
and and it is in favor of even if it doesn't even if she doesn't say explicitly i'm pro-authoritarianist
a pro-authoritarian there's a reason why putin cites her there's a reason why trump has effectively
cited her or her group in in this um hideous uh executive order so what i don't understand is how
they sleep i mean how do these folks sleep i don't understand i mean yeah just just in terms of so
people know the reference jk rowling was referenced in the speech by vladimir putin and when he cited it in
um in a speech criticizing cancel culture like a some sort of fox news pundit i mean just quickly
on that jake i mean the idea of something now jk jk rowling's official spokesperson not something
um obviously people are accustomed to but i mean what she says in response to people like us there
well actually that's not fair that's outrageous how dare both of you um because the real issue is the
left gave up this territory i'm i'm yeah i've been on the ivy i've supported labor all my life that kind
of you know that's what she'd say but the left went off into this um extreme um territory and what
you expect the right then have come in and taken it as the issue and that's your that's our fault
well it's not extreme territory but right-wing extremists have been enormously inflammatory about
it right so they've stoked fears that now makes people feel that oh gender trans all these issues they
they're going to destroy my family they're going to destroy my sex they're going to destroy the
earth society as we know it i mean massively hyperbolic fears so who has taken a legitimate
civil rights issue and made it so inflammatory and we've seen this in the history of civil rights in
the u.s like if black people were to have civil rights said many right-wing racists in the united
states in the 50s and the 60s and deep into the 70s if they were to have equality that would be the
end of society as we know it that would be chaos that would be the end of the law that would be the
end of the family of community of church it's like no none of those things happen none of those things
happened just talking about the white supremacist idea of family church and society yes i'm sorry
you know they had to grieve that loss that's right but i mean i'm interested in how will your thoughts on
how rights rise and fall together and actually how this cuts across the claim that for example trans
rights and women's rights on a collision course which has become so much part of the discourse in
this country and when if you look at for example ireland or spain uh they've had in the last few
years you've had and in ireland for example uh equal marriage and the right to abortion limited
compared to other countries but still the right to abortion and as well as trans rights legislation
passed in spain equally you've had legislation uh taking on male violence against girls and women
and as well as uh support for uh the rights of lesbian mothers and you've had trans rights legislation
and whereas if you look at italy for example you've had um a government which is anti-trans and also
taking lesbian mothers off birth certificates and of course in the united states you have seen
across the board if you have an and the assault on trans rights and the stronger that is in in any
given state normally the stronger the stronger the backlash is against women's reproductive rights the
right to choose and this reflected you think you know with trump's executive orders as well what do you
think about that actually this is a very clear you can see there that rights rise and fall that
women's rights in all in in an inclusive sense uh trans rights and lgbtq rights they rise they they
actually rise and fall together and that's the tendency we can see today yes but you see i think
look i mean you're right to say that in the uk there's a movement to pit women's rights understood as
within a radical feminist frame a contemporary radical feminist claim frame not the traditional
radical feminist claim um of andrea dworkin or someone like her who would have nothing to do
with contemporary radical feminism but okay there is an effort to pit so-called women's rights meaning
uh assigned female at birth women against trans rights in order to discount uh or refuse the claim
that trans women are women and um and that's their way of drawing that line but in fact um if we take the
more capacious idea of sex discrimination that i was just describing like women are discriminated
against because they're assumed to be a certain way they can't do that job or they should be doing
another job or i don't take them seriously because they are women right trans people are discriminated
against because they there are caricatures and prejudicial understandings of who they are and what
they're about including the idea that they're all actually rapists or men who have nefarious designs
on women which i find to be enormously offensive and not at all um uh supported by evidence i mean we
could find the example but if we make the example into the paradigm for understanding trans life then
that's incredibly transphobic it's not happening to gay people it's probably to gay people as well
right i mean it's like well here's a gay person did something wrong well all gay people do that
here's a jewish person nefarious financial transaction oh all jewish people we don't do that
right like we don't do that um uh unless we are openly interested in discrimination but but look these
are common concerns like anti-violence anti-discrimination freedom to live our lives as we must autonomy as a
feminist value in relationship to reproductive rights as a trans value in relationship to sex
assignment why wouldn't those be enormous bonds of solidarity but also working conditions who who is
who's denied employment who's treated badly in the workplace who doesn't get the job because of a
prejudicial understanding of who they are on the basis of their sex and you know sex discrimination
is discrimination on the basis of a perception of sex like oh this person because they are that
sex cannot do x and y or this person on the basis of their sex cannot possibly be a member of our
community cannot fit in to our academic department it's it's a prejudicial understanding of sex so
what's actually being corrected is the prejudice and the prejudice happens against trans people it
happens against non-binary and happens against all women with in an inclusive way and so-called effeminate
men who don't comport with certain ideas of masculinity right we can we can have a capacious idea of gender
that brings all of those things together and shows us that these are issues of employment and hence class
right and hence inequality social inequality these are not elite issues these are life and death issues
for people who are trying to live and work and love freely in this world why wouldn't why wouldn't we
all come together in wishing for that world well it's not certainly not the world we have at the moment
and on that let me just say this it's worse in the uk than anywhere else yeah i know that pitting of
feminism against trans that most feminists in the u.s do not feel this way and throughout latin america
the major feminist movements in chile and argentina are all trans inclusive in south africa they are
trans inclusive they understand these to be massively important coalitions they are anti-violence they're
anti-extractivist they work within anti-colonial frameworks they they're not having these these you know
identitarian struggles of this kind they are trying to build large forms of solidarity to fight enormous
forms of power and i should say of course there are lots of trans inclusive feminist thing because
in britain yeah obviously they live in this neighborhood for some reason yeah yeah you're
currently in stone yungton there's a there's a there's certainly a lot of uh it's it's not a transphobic
hotbed i don't think um the let's just just in terms of the world we're currently in as is uh the
united states where you're visiting from has fascism come to the united states do you think is that
hyperbolic it is not hyperbolic um i guess i make a distinction uh between a fascist state a set of
fascist trends that are operating within a particular society and fascist passions
which can be stoked and amplified by usually um uh autocratic or overtly authoritarian powers
so i think what we're actually seeing right now is um an increasingly authoritarian state which is
challenging uh principles of democracy including the separation of powers and the constant and
constitutional democracy as such um but it is supported by stoking fascist passions which are
passions for elimination like vulnerable groups that are identifiable by uh autocratic regimes like
migrants like international students like trans people like non-gender conforming people these folks and
all those who are involved in diversity equity and inclusion which is just another way of saying
racialized right racialized people so the to deny them rights to eliminate their rights and in some cases
to deny their very existence or to deport them uh detain them incarcerate them uh in an effort to uh undermine
their capacity to exercise rights or to strip them of rights altogether so these are to a certain degree um
eliminationist strategies where you're trying forcibly to deport a group of people at the border you're
trying or to the border you're trying to purify the society of dissident elements i mean all of these are
eliminationist and i would say that the fascist dimension is surely um uh bound up with the desire uh to
eliminate certain populations from the broader community and to target them to strip them of rights to deport them
now this is not very far i'm afraid to say from a foreign policy that basically says um the gazans
should be subject to forcible displacement clear the land they don't belong to that land they have no
rights to that land so forcible displacement or continuing bombardment which actually takes their lives
and destroys the infrastructures of life i mean i think we need to think about this how how often is
forcible uh displacement now being invoked as the way to so-called solve a perceived social problem like
migration or rights stripping which i take to be an excited form of of fascist practice but which
involves or implies the augmentation the strengthening of a state apparatus that is more and more skeptical
of democratic principles and willing to override constitutional democracy as we know it before i
ask you i want to talk about palestine um what i'm interested in and i i don't i don't think i've had
a satisfactory answer to this is with trumpism why now and by that the reason i'm asking is exactly 90
years ago a very famous book sinclair lewis it can't happen here which look which obviously at the
time you had fascism on the march in in germany and italy in particular but also elsewhere it was
just before the spanish civil war um and obviously what that looked at is the potential actually what
if it did happen in the united states it looks at the rise of a dictator and actually there was quite
disturbing echoes with donald trump actually the reason i ask why now is you know if you look at
fascism in the 1930s um capitalism was in an extremely acute crisis at that particular time
and there was also an insurgent left you'd have the russian revolution the threat of so-called
bolshevism you know terrified elites across the you know they're going to come for us so fascism then
became you know something which became seen as a a a crude vulgar last resort for many business elites
essentially and you had a lower middle class being forced to be proletarianized i guess driven into the
working class and in the 1970s the us was in real crisis in lots of ways defeated in vietnam
stagflation racist backlash to the civil rights movement riots across the united states and and
a mass actually a genuine increase in violent crime which is much bigger than it is today
i could go on but you know you had george wallace at the time but he didn't get away he got 12 13
he got 13 in 68 yeah and he was the alabama segregationist for those who don't know yes i
certainly remember but why why now why i mean i'm not saying the economic model is in crisis i get
that and this is obviously a big part of it but why did it happen why does this happen now and not in
the 1970s for example well i think we have to remember um uh that the neoliberal consensus in the
democratic party which includes biden and harris um has uh implied for many people a um degradation or
absence of basic social services as um as basic social services are no longer provided by the
state and they become increasingly privatized um people don't know if they can afford basic things
and let's also remember we've seen the decimation of unions in the u.s which means that work the
conditions of work have changed people are on temporary contracts if they're on contracts they
don't have proper representation they are they risk health issues on the workplace or massive sense of
insecurity about the future the farmers don't know whether their farms are going to um uh be able to
produce a lot of people can't make a living wage they're they're working over time some of the taxi
drivers i talked to are working over time they they need to send money back to their parents in
another country and they don't have enough and they're they keep working and i can't tell you
what their hours are it's absolutely horrible but we um i think more and more people are either in debt
or can't make ends meet or live in fear that there's no future there's no future perhaps for their
children or for them or for a way of life that they remember or that they wish for
so the strong state apparatus and the fascist zeal to eliminate populations or strip them of their
rights um you know that comes along with a sense of oh then an order will be restored oh then things
will go back to being the way they are and i'll have a more secure sense of family of community of
church of of order in the world and i'll be able to project a future in which i thrive and my my
children thrive i mean i think people are terrified about the future now there are all kinds of reasons
why they are and i think we can look at the neoliberal permutation of capitalism which is huge and the
democrats have extended that we can look at the ways in which people have been forcibly displaced the
terror that is that accompanies consciously or unconsciously climate catastrophe especially
for people in agrarian businesses or living on in coastal or river regions you know there's a lot
that's unpredictable and totally frightening also open-ended wars you know waged and sustained for
reasons that are either completely unjust or unclear um i i think people have a lot of reasons to be
afraid um and some of them have to do with their their own capacity to reproduce the conditions of
their own life and some of them have to do with an intimate sense of who they are and their family
and their place in the world and you can stoke fears more fears from that state of fear or you know
and you could say it's gender it's trans it's migrants that's what's really happening and then
all the systemic issues the militarism the borders the climate issue the capitalism and its neoliberal
variant all of these things are exonerated right attention is deflected from them all so the left
really actually needs to to say this is the reason why you're feeling frightened and insecure and this
is the world that we want to realize together right but if we don't do that we're we're failing
in some fundamental way it's interesting you mentioned war because when i went to the trump
rallies in various states um they came across a lot of those attending as kind of anti-migrant peace
nicks because they talked about the wars generally a lot so that came up it was generally inflation
migrants wars but the other point is that what you just said i think this is that's my thesis about
the donald trump cares about you kamala harris cares about they then which isn't actually
about people who are obsessed with trans people because most people just aren't actually it's not
on people's radar generally at all it's more a sense of if the democrats don't have a transformative
agenda for working class people which meets their needs and directs anger at elites and at the same
time they have a kind of a liberal identity politics check box approach but it's all rhetorical it's easy
for the right to say they have nothing to say for you but they only care about these minorities and
that's what they have the right i've always tried to do and obviously you know steve ballad
talks about flood the zone with if the democrats don't have a coherent answer to the
problems of americans of all of working class americans of all types yeah then it's easy to go
they only care about these minorities and we want people to care about do you see what i mean
that's that's how they maybe maybe i mean i do i do fault the centrist democratic party um for it's
for some of its failure but i also think we have to take into account the the media blitz which you
yourself documented quite well by the right wing and some of their robo calls i was in i was in um
michigan the week of the election and people were saying everybody they knew got a robo call
where a man said kamala harris will authorize trans surgeries on illegal migrants right and i just
thought oh god how perfect they put together two fears that people have and then they stoke them they
but and amalgamate them so that it's all going to happen at the same time but also involved in that
is kamala harris what did you know we have to ask whether people in the united states could really
handle having a woman of color who is educated and liberal um in the non-financial sense but um uh
could they handle that or was there the the a racist aversion to the elite black president which
we also saw in a certain kind of rancorous uh reaction against the obamas which was amazing full of
kind of wild hatred right you know you can have your critique of obama i have my critique of obama
the wild hatred for the obamas and the caricatures you know that that's a form of racism in the u.s
that most of the pollsters didn't take into account because who's going to admit to that
people don't admit to that even though it's totally operative in the ways in which they identify or or
indeed hate um so it produces her as an elite you know san francisco black brown woman who's going to
impose this agenda that has nothing to do with you and she's going to abandon you and she's going to
undermine your way of life and you know that was clever on their part it was massively unjust
and you know i would like to see a certain kind of a socialism in the u.s can only mean kind of basic
social democracy of the bernie kind but even that you know like that's we do need a kind of resurgence
of that in a new way and i'm hoping that another generation of politicians will be able to take that up
yeah there's certainly an inspiring signs in that regard i just want to finally talk about
palestine i just want to talk about that finally with you um i mean first i just in terms i mean
look the west has facilitated being complicit in all sorts of heinous crimes throughout history
i just wonder what you think in terms of this is a crime which is so confessed to
and uh by its perpetrators in a way which is i mean when i you know um interviewed
um an israeli um american um associate professor holocaust genocide study towards the beginning
he said it's actually very rare states normally go to great lengths to cover up their intent
and but but also uh evidence does it happen partly thanks to social media mobile phones that kind of
thing i'm just interested in the impact of that actually in terms of because it kind of normalizes
i mean there are lots of obviously those who are fighting very strongly against this genocide
but it has kind of normalized a form of just extraordinary barbarism um which people obviously
can see with their own eyes and hit but i mean it's it's do you know what do you do you see what i'm
getting at yeah it's this kind of normalization of but i don't believe in the whiggish view of history
that but we put towards enlightenment liberty and you know as as the years go on things improve
obviously that that was buried in auschwitz-birkenau and before that the somme but there is there was
something quite disturbing about this level of depravity and how it can be tolerated and in in full
broad daylight and i just what's your thoughts about the consequences yes well um look i think
uh if you if you listen carefully to the um to what some of the the right-wing uh members of knesset
say or the internal members of um netanyahu's government or the the generals very often you do hear
um the idea that these people palestinians if they're even called that um deserve what they got
they're all hamas they committed atrocities we as long as they are still on that land we will be
threatened existentially any act of bombardment or killing is therefore justified um and indeed
the killing becomes a kind of joyous celebration of self-defense and um where self-defense means um
is defined by this idea that israel will only be defended if it uh obliterates this other people so
annihilation and eliminationism becomes a condition of being truly self-defended being truly safe
um i had an israeli friend many years a friend who wrote to me how can you sign this petition for a
ceasefire don't you know that the minute there's a ceasefire they will come into tel aviv and kill us
they will kill me and this belief is um it's it's more prevalent than um people realize uh there's obviously
a number of israelis who don't hold to this view and who are critical and who are on the left and are
just an enormously um underrepresented minority at this moment um but i think that that is operative the
other um the other um the other point i think is that the hatred and the anti-palestinian racism
is advertised um and is promoted as part of the war effort but also as part of a um toxic nationalism
um that um is trying to to continue to get support for its not just its war against palestinian life
but its own power right so so again stoking enormous fear and hatred for the purposes of
celebrating a military vanquishing which is genocidal in its actions um becomes uh the way
a to basically say israel will not suffer another genocide because we are annihilating those who
would annihilate us and we're doing it in advance this time and it doesn't understand its own
annihilation practices as genocidal it cannot it saves that word for its own history but it will not accept
a comparative genocide framework or understand its own actions as technically genocidal
according to the genocide convention which which it is which is i mean that genocidal mentality is
it's often forgotten this is i mean it's one of the most common genocidal tropes in the random
genocide the utah extremists said that if we don't kill them they will kill us i can't tell you how
often it is said to me by israelis who challenge me up for my views i i and and again i'm not making
a generalization about israelis i don't actually believe there is one point of view there but there
is a point a pro-war point of view that is deeply committed to that notion in terms of just a couple
of final things on on palestine in terms of free speech because donald trump and jd vance have wrapped
themselves in the guards of free speech and now are obviously throttling funding to education institutions
including columbia uh basically for not cracking down enough on uh and pro-palestine demonstrations
which is ludicrous because columbia really victimized its students but also deporting
uh you know they're beginning to deport green card holders uh he's been involved in this process
well i mean what just the again trumpism authoritarian ideology turned reality on its head that's what they
always do but just what's your thoughts on that well first of all um i think there's a question um
of um whether um the trump administration wants to make an example of some key protesters in order
to frighten people or whether it really has a systematic detention and deportation plan for um uh
uh uh non-citizens who protest uh the israeli um actions in gaza um and i um i'm not sure it does
it has now published um not just the 10 primary universities where they suspect they they claim
there is anti-semitic um um protest going on um not a protest against anti-semitism
but a a protest that is itself anti-semitic but another 60 or so institutions have recently been
named and of course it shoots fear into those institutions all of which are to one degree or
another dependent on federal funding and which trump is claiming he can withdraw or suspend if they don't
comply with his with his detention and deportation efforts so this puts all of these universities in a
in a situation where they have to decide whether they're going to be complicit and hand over their
students or their community members or whether they're going to refuse to implement and interestingly
enough i mean there there's a lot of discussion about what non-implementation would imply um or
how to appear to comply without complying i mean we will see all kinds of strategies going on here
but i think what i um what worries me most and one can see this in the so-called
project esther document um that was published by the heritage foundation
um let's remember the heritage foundation is the one that produced project 2025 which has which laid out
many of the uh items that needed to happen which are now um happening with this flurry of executive
orders okay but this is what i want to say about project esther and i'm saying it on the eve of purim
i think it's almost purim i'm a i'm a quasi good jew
um project esther claims that um all tonight tonight yeah it is tonight okay so a good moment to remember
that esther was actually in favor of a liberation that um is in no way uh expressed by the heritage
foundation their claim is that there is a hamas support network that's their phrase and that all of
these protests on college campuses are undertaken protests against israel are undertaken by hamas
supporters so if you engage in a protest against israeli bombardment tactical starvation forcible
displacement um annihilation if you protest against those on principled reasons you will be understood
according to this framework as a hamas supporter right and it's very hard to get untarred by that
charge i can i can tell you i've never supported hamas right but if you say oh look folks this is a
resistance movement people will say oh why are you using that word rather than terrorists it's like
not because i support it but because it's descriptive right if this is not actually even controversially
descriptive but you can't describe using certain language because you will then be hamas like oh
only a hamas supporter would say that like oh what happened to judith butler now she's you know all of
this but what having been tarred in that way and having never supported him i'm now seeing everybody's
being tarred um that every form of protest is eligible to be tarred with the allegation that you
support hamas you're part of a hamas support network so for instance the young man khanil who
is now detained in louisiana he's never said anything about hamas there's no evidence at all
that he actually supported hamas no uh right he led a student protest or one of the leaders of a student
protest um and it's the protest itself which is now being construed as pro hamas so once that happens
and this is really important to underscore even full citizens he had a green card right which gives him
nearly all the same rights and obligations of citizens but even citizens who are underscored
tarred or branded as pro hamas can be labeled as domestic enemies of the u.s they can be detained they
can be imprisoned and that is on the horizon i'm not saying it will happen but it can happen under this
new aegis supplied by the heritage foundation and adopted by the trump administration and we need to
become extremely alert not because citizens are the lives of citizens are more valuable than non-citizens
but because everybody has who is protesting may well find that their legitimate constitutional rights
or human rights as the case may be can be suspended and eliminated and just very finally i mean what's
your thoughts on trump uh posing or wrapping this up general trump with all his associations all his
rhetoric all his history as protect about jewish safety he's protecting jewish safety and um fighting
anti-semitism and fighting racism that's that's his approach that's what he's claiming well you
know a number of jewish scholars and activists have openly objected to this there's a great petition by
um um not in our name if not now jewish voice for peace um you know scholars like mariana hirsch and
others have written compelling pieces to say jewish values are not linked with the trump administration
they don't need his paternalistic protection that um that uh that knocking on somebody's door at five
in the morning and detaining them for having exercised a legitimate right of protest i mean that's
that's that's that's that's an echo of a state intrusion that takes us back to nazism and the
persecution of the jews it's part of the jewish population a good part of the jewish population
in the us it's always been in favor of of of civil rights of basic um free speech and freedom of
assembly and you know jews were also disproportionately um persecuted under the mccarthy era era where they
were suspected of being un-american right which is an anti-semitic trope like oh if you're jewish you
you you have a loyalty to another place you don't really belong you're not really american you have
to provide your credentials you're probably a communist looking to undermine so we've suffered
you know we've suffered that kind of persecution what would it mean for us to line up behind that
kind of persecution that would be to undermine some of the most important ethical and political
principles of of jewish life in the 20th and 21st century it's been such an honor to speak to again
and hopefully um the next time i speak to you there won't be an ever deeper descent into darkness
although who can who can say we have to expand our solidarities and get our vision together right
there's exactly yeah quickly exactly very quickly i think i think quick i think speed is definitely
um but do everyone who's afraid of gender is now out in paperback and yes do make sure you get a copy
everyone and do share the video press like and subscribe leave comments good for the algorithm
more people listen to judith with a huge last time people are still watching the interview we did
uh from years ago but um judith as ever it's such an honor thank you so much for your moral clarity and
your insights oh well it's my it's my honor owen thank you
