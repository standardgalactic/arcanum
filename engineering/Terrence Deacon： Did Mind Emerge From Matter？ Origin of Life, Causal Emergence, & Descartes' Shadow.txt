Life is something interesting.
Life has to use self-organizing processes to generate its order.
This is the way that work, like heat, can generate order.
It forces things to become regularized.
It constrains the movement of molecules.
It constrains the chemistry of molecules.
Life has to depend upon self-organizing processes, or what I call morphodynamic processes.
But it also has to stabilize, promote those self-organizing processes, and keep them from running to their end.
So I'm a process.
I'm continually, actively doing stuff, dumping energy in in the form of oxygen and food, and doing work, chemical work, to keep things going.
I've got to keep it going.
But in fact, I can now adjust to how much food, how much oxygen, how much work I'm doing, all kinds of ways, because the system has found ways to stabilize this.
The question is, how do you stabilize these self-destructive processes?
And the answer is, you have to pit them against each other.
Terence, thanks for joining me.
It's such a great privilege to have you with me.
I've been reading, watching you for over decades at this point.
And my first question to you is, what is your conceptual understanding of the mind-body problem?
How do you think of this from a historic perspective?
When you think of the mind-body problem, what comes to your mind over time?
Well, first of all, it's a deep confusion.
And it's a deep confusion that goes all the way back to Plato.
And that has to do with the fact that we think about the material world and the formal or abstract world is like they're separate things.
Aristotle, I think, initially tried to resolve this by this concept called hylomorphism.
Hylo, referring at the time to, you know, just substrate or substance.
It really means, effectively, it's a word for wood.
But hylomorphism, basically, for Aristotle was that there's no such thing as form without matter.
And there's no such thing with matter that has no form.
That is, they're always one and the same thing.
And I've seen that as ultimately the problem that raises its head with Descartes.
And then follows us into the present.
And I think we're still living deeply in what I call deeply the shadow of Descartes in this respect.
And then we can't even seem to think outside of that box.
But I think Aristotle's hint is the right hint.
And that is, there is nothing like information or mind or representation or semiosis without a substrate.
It's something that's always substrate.
But there is no substrate, no electricity, no neural activity that is not somehow formed, has not formed.
I think one of the problems is that we have this sense of form that is, you know, it's based upon our instincts about things like triangles and circles and things that are these abstract relationships.
When, in fact, form is really just, you know, a little bit less than chaotic.
So any chaotic process that has a little repetitiveness to it, a little bit of redundancy, a little bit of regularity is formed to some extent.
It's constrained so that not all of its possibilities are taken into account.
And so I would say that also about mental processes, living processes, and so on.
But I think the real challenge is this.
And this is something that Aristotle does not have, which is necessary for understanding both life and mind, I think.
And that is that the formal activity that a living process or a mental process is generating is about its substrate, about its necessary substrate.
And the substrate is such that it makes possible the constraint of the future form of that substrate.
And so that it's what Doug Hostet would call a strange loop.
But here what I mean is a different kind.
It's not just a strange loop like feedback is.
It's a strange loop in which the form or the constraint determines the substrate.
And the substrate determines the form in this complicated relationship.
And so that everything, I think, is ultimately about my substance and about how my substance is part of the world, is part of the physical world, as is the constraint.
But the issue is that the constraint is not something there in the sense that an atom is there.
It's there in the absence to some extent.
That's why a constraint is important.
A constraint is just simply those things which are prevented, that don't tend to happen.
And as a result, it's why we seem to have this sense that there's a dualistic aspect to the world, because it's the presence and the absence.
But the key is you can't have presence without absence, and you can't have absence without presence.
But in life, they have this weird, strange loop causal effect in which one is determining the other, playing a role in constraining the other.
Each is constraining the other.
So it's constraints that make themselves possible.
It's materials that make the constraints possible.
And that's the real challenge.
What that means is we've got to get out from under the shadow.
And I think we are impressed by this, in part because of the success of the computational world.
In the computational world, if you think about what a computer is, it's Descartes incarnate to some extent.
Even though Descartes himself said that the computation should not be possible in one sense.
He didn't think of it in those terms, but he basically makes that claim in part of his reasoning.
But the issue is very simple.
What we've done with computing is, of course, we've created these devices.
We've given them energy and embodiment.
And we let them run form, but the form has nothing to do with the embodiment.
It plays no role in what kind of transistors, what kind of material is there.
There is no strange loop.
We have systematically created this Cartesian separation of the hardware and the software.
And so we can now think about thought processes as software.
And we've only become more and more confused now that we've got these things like large language models
that make it look like the machine is thinking, you know.
No, it's not alive.
It's Descartes.
And we're getting fooled by Descartes again.
And so a lot of my work has been an attempt to sort of undo that.
I spoke to Keith Frankish about a week ago.
He gave me, well, he spoke for the entire Sunday for about three hours in a normal podcast.
And then he gave me a lecture for about two and a half hours.
So it was almost six hours of my entire Sunday.
Worth it.
But the main topic of that was escaping Descartes' prison.
So.
Yeah, good.
I don't know his work.
So it would be, I'm glad you mentioned it.
So Keith and Daniel Dennett worked on what is known as illusionism.
And their focus is on illusionism as a theory.
Oh, yes.
I know Dan, Dan, I knew him very well.
We were in Boston for 20 years at the same time interacting.
And over the years, we continued to interact, even though we were on opposite sides of many of these questions.
So, and Dan, of course, was trying to make that escape as well.
And yet, I think he fell right into it.
And we continued to have this argument until he passed.
Karens, why do you think he fell into it?
Rest in peace, Dan.
I mean, he's an icon that we all miss and love.
It was great to have him in this conversation, conversation, consciousness conversation, sorry.
Yes.
No, he's one of the most fun thinkers that I know of.
You know, we parried back and forth over the years.
That he became enthralled with Dawkins' notion of memes at some point.
Memes, I think, are a misunderstanding of genes.
Because I think Dawkins misunderstands genes as well.
And this is why it really, it requires us to go back and talk about the nature of life itself.
But Dawkins' idea was that things that just get copied, get replicated, are enough to make something alive.
But in fact, there is no strange loop in this story.
There is just patterns that get copied.
And so when you translate this idea to cultural and informational processes, again, it has this Cartesian sense.
So what it does is it tends to force you to say, well, that maybe that's just illusionary.
There's nothing really there.
It's just this material stuff.
That's all we have to pay attention to.
And the aboutness relationship is not really something unique.
It's just an illusion.
I mean, the obvious question is, well, who's having this illusion?
And what would it mean to have an illusion in this story?
I think it's self-contradictory, ultimately.
For the same reason.
It's the reason that we fall in this reductionistic trend.
We've said, well, maybe if dualism is a problem, let's just get rid of half of the story.
Let's just ignore the constraints.
Let's just ignore the form.
Let's just ignore the aboutness relationship.
Because aboutness, of course, is this relationship between something present and something absent.
And that can't be real from this perspective.
Because absences disappear.
So, in any case, the good news is that Dan and I agreed and yet disagreed.
And it was great for that reason.
He's not the only person.
You've studied under Noam Chomsky and have had major disagreements with him.
How's that been like over the years?
Well, so, my interaction with him is, of course, when I was a young graduate student, I was in the Boston area of Harvard.
And I took a course with him and interacted with him on and off over that time.
And we never really spent a lot of time working, quote, together.
So, I want to be clear that, you know, yes, I took a course or two with him.
And, in fact, I took this one course with he and, it was an advanced graduate course with he and Jerry Fodor, the philosopher.
Who at the time...
To me, that sounds like the most amazing lecture to be a part of.
It wasn't crazy.
It was crazy.
But, of course, I was studying at the same time I was studying neuroscience.
And so, here I am, you know, interested in neuroscience.
I actually came to Harvard initially as a young graduate student to study the work of Charles Sanders Peirce, the philosopher.
And found out that I was having trouble getting to his work, which was there, but it was inaccessible to me.
And I began to sort of shift over.
Now, what I brought to that conversation with Chomsky and Fodor, of course, as this kid.
You know, here I am a graduate student.
You're these famous guys.
It was this idea that, first of all, this idea of an innate universal grammar capacity.
This is just biologically implausible to me.
You know, I knew, you know, this is not the kind of thing you can think about in a biological sense.
Yes, maybe philosophical, yes.
But, you know, biologically, how could it possibly come to be?
And, of course, Chomsky had this view that it couldn't have evolved.
That it was just sort of this magic bullet that, you know, a mutation that changed the brain and gave us this computational device.
Well, first of all, I don't think the brain's compute, so I think there's a problem, a deep problem there.
But it's compacted with this view that Jerry had at the time that you can't even evolve this stuff.
That is, you can't derive a more complex system from a simpler system.
Well, of course, evolution is all about differentiating from less complex to more complex.
So these views, to me, were just so weird.
And so I was constantly in this battle.
And we finally had a conversation.
I had a conversation with Norman, which I said, let's talk about purse.
At least maybe we can talk about this together.
And I said, isn't the problem of acquiring language a little bit like abduction for purse?
Abduction is this theory.
So abduction is contrasted with deduction and induction.
We can talk about that distinction at some point.
But I said, isn't there a logic?
Can we not talk about this sort of process logic of how we might be, you know, in each generation acquiring language without having to have some special computational device?
And he said, oh, sure.
But, you know, purse's idea of abduction, that's just instinct.
And I said, no, no, it's a totally different story.
We couldn't come to an agreement about this.
So over the years, it's gone back and forth.
In my book, in the mid-90s, Symbolic Species, I sort of argued against the innate grammar device kind of argument.
And in a chapter I called Chomsky's handstand.
He hated that, obviously.
But his response to my work has always been, it's incomprehensible.
It doesn't make any sense at all.
And my response in return is, of course, that his idea is biologically implausible.
So where do you go from there?
Interestingly enough, now, decades and decades later, I've come to believe that there is universal grammar.
Although I argued against universal grammar at the time.
And I still argue against the way Noam Chomsky would think about it.
That is, that universal grammar is somehow biologically built in.
I don't think so at all.
In fact, I think it should have a capital U at the front of it.
Universal grammar.
In the sense that we think of mathematics as universal.
That is, we expect that if sometime in the far, far distant future in a galaxy far, far away,
there's a set of creatures that develop mathematics,
they will eventually, if they keep working at it, discover something like prime numbers.
Even though prime numbers are the exception to a rule.
You know, they're not, they're not the rule.
They're the exception to this notion of recursive subtraction, division.
They'll discover it not because, not because it's in the universe.
Not because it's in their biology.
Not because it is something that a culture could come up with.
But because it's necessitated by the semiotic nature of quantity, of working with quantity.
It's there.
So my argument about grammar is that there's universal features that we share, that all languages share.
But it's neither nature nor nurture.
So one of the problems we've had, and this is a, it's kind of parallel with the dualism story.
And we think there's only two possibilities.
You know, well, the nature-nurture story is the same one.
We think there's only two possibilities.
Either it's there because of nature, or it's there because of nurture.
No, but there's another third possibility.
It's necessitated by the semiotic structure of the process we're engaged in.
And the semiotic structure, like a mathematical structure, has certain things.
If you make certain moves, you're required to make other moves.
If you eliminate certain things, you're required to eliminate and add certain other things.
It's just, you know, to be internally consistent, that's what's necessary.
I think you could say that about language.
I think a lot of features of language are that way.
So I've tried to basically lay out some of them and to pursue that question in some detail to say,
look, we should be able to see these features in children as they acquire language.
We should be able to see how they're not easily accessible to other species,
like chimpanzees, that we're trying to teach language to.
We should be able to, these are empirical questions,
even though they're not nature nor nurture questions.
Terence, there's something, I've got so many questions prepped for you,
but while we're on this topic, I asked, no, I think twice I asked him this question.
How does he feel about the fact that linguistic capabilities might hinder us
from explaining phenomena that are beyond the human comprehension, for example?
Let's say we're trying to understand a certain concept.
We only have a certain amount of vocabulary, concepts, viewpoints.
How can we articulate what we believe consciousness is?
Do you think this is something that might hinder us from understanding the heart problem
or the mind-body problem?
No.
To be very clear, I think that actually our symbolic capacities will allow us to deal with it.
And there's a reason for that.
And that is that they're, in a sense, our symbolic referential systems are detached.
In an interesting way, they're kind of ungrounded, so that they are not limited by our capacities.
Now, that doesn't mean that, you know, we have the capacity to hold all the details in mind.
And one of the reasons we use computers to do a lot of things is they can handle a lot of the details
that we just don't have enough memory space to hang on to.
But using these kind of prostheses, the prostheses of writing, of conversation, of accumulating
knowledge, of using tools to expand this access, to give us a vision into areas we could not
see otherwise, and to hold on to regularities and properties and laws that we are unable to
see because they're just too complex statistically to hold into our heads.
But once we have and develop these prostheses, these things that are progressively displaced
from our own limitations, I think we have the ability to go there.
So it's not like the argument where we would say that a dog will never understand the theory
of relativity.
That's not the claim I'm making.
It's that once we have this mode of cognition and this mode of shared cognition, and that's
the important thing.
This is not just limited to my head.
You and I have to share this in order for it to work.
I and my computing devices have to have an interface that allows us to sort of work together,
even though the computing device is not a machine, it's just a machine, it's not a being in that
sense.
Nevertheless, it's a prosthetic, you know, like we're using right now to interact with each
other, and it expands its capacity.
But that means that I don't think it's impossible.
Even more interestingly, I don't think it's impossible for us to actually build it.
Now, I don't think we're anywhere near that, and I think computing, as I said, is lost in
Descartes' shadow.
So we're not going to do it by expanding our computing capacities.
But the fact that you and I have these experiences, that you and I are able to express these ideas,
I mean, ideas, you know, about the paradox of a strange loop, about infinities, you know,
about universal grammar, that kind of stuff, the fact that we can do that, it's just such
a remarkable capacity, precisely because it's not in anybody's head, it's between us.
And as a result, there's endless possibilities here.
Now, here's the problem.
We do get stuck.
You know, the Cartesian story is a story about being stuck for hundreds and hundreds of years.
In fact, if we carry it back to Plato, thousands of years.
It's a hard one to think.
You know, the reality of the world is very counterintuitive in many respects.
And we just get stuck on parts of it.
But if we can keep doing this kind of thing for another few centuries, that's exciting.
It is.
I often feel like we're living in this new age of consciousness research.
It's like a revolution at this point.
So many minds getting together.
This community online is allowing people to discuss concepts that were otherwise very separate entities.
Someone would be sitting in one lab in the middle of Boston, while the other person in the middle of Cape Town, where I am, doing their own form of research.
But now we're able to talk about this.
I'm able to bring work from Mark Solms from Cape Town to Michael Levin.
And these types of people who are bringing up different work, yet very similar in so many different aspects.
And that's, by the way, one of the questions I came across quite often online is,
it would be epic to see Terence Deacon speak with Michael Levin.
Are you familiar with Michael Levin's work, Terence?
Michael Levin and I actually were at a conference together.
He was online.
I was in person in Notre Dame this last fall.
And actually, it was last February, I guess.
He and I come from, in some respects, very similar backgrounds.
In that, you know, I as a neuroscientist, an evolutionary biologist, and someone who, as I said, has this strong sort of Persean angle driving my thinking.
Although I don't consider myself a Persean either.
Michael, of course, comes from a background of evolutionary biology as well.
I mean, I spent all the 1990s, pretty much, doing cross-species fetal neural transplantation to ask the question, you know,
how do developmental processes in the nervous system sort of build nervous systems that are different in different species?
And he, of course, is working at a different kind of developmental range, particularly his early work with the planaria flatworms,
in which he was looking at how, you know, the structure of the body gets built.
And yet, we look at these two processes from, to some extent, very different angles.
And I find it just remarkable that that's the case.
We have never actually directly, the two of us, sort of tried to sort out these differences.
I suspect that he has a bias towards what I call pre-formationism.
Pre-formationism says that there's somehow a sort of a map there for how bodies or brains should be built.
And that map gets generated.
I am much more of a self-organizer, organizing thinker, that I think that these things emerge.
That is, that they have to do with the particular kinds of interactions, and there's not really a sort of advanced plan behind this.
But I'm probably caricaturing his work, and I want to be careful.
He calls it teleodynamics at this point.
Sorry, no, you call it teleodynamics.
He calls it teleonomy.
And the work's very similar.
And by the way, he's one of the few guests who've been on the show more than three times.
It would be great, I wish, if I could get the both of you on together, it would be great to hear your views in one room.
It would be a real challenge.
So, yeah, I think it would be fun.
I think that's exactly what the people want.
Yeah, and, of course, he worked with Dan for a long period of time at Tuts.
And so they have a lot in common.
And I'm sure that he at least knows a little of my work as I know a little of his.
But that's another feature of this.
We, you know, as all of us, there's so much to know.
You know, he should be reading a lot of my work.
I should be reading a lot of his work before we ever, you know, ever put the same room together.
He's such a wonderful person.
I swear to you, he probably has read your work and has a great deal of respect for it.
That's the type of person he is.
That's terrific.
Well, similarly, I think, you know, his work is so creative.
I love the creativity of it.
I interpret it differently.
But that doesn't mean I don't really respect the creativity of it.
Because it's very out of the box, so to speak.
And that is, he's taking a view of these same kind of processes that are not mainstream.
And that's a problem with the way people perceive these conversations nowadays,
is that if two philosophers or scientists disagree with one topic,
it means that they just don't like each other.
And that's not the case.
This is, these are two people who have firmly dense beliefs in certain scientific views
that they've accumulated over time.
It's not that they just read one paper and decided to make us a firm, fixed, false belief on this.
It's that you've spent a vast majority of your life working on a specific project.
And this is why you've come to believe what you believe.
It's not to say you're wrong or right,
but it's quite cool to see you disagree or agree with someone who's also quite accomplished.
Exactly.
No, and I think that's, you know,
why the interaction between Noam Chomsky and myself has been an interesting one.
But again, there's also this sort of intellectual hierarchy.
You know, I came to interact with him as this graduate student from another background, you know.
And so that will never change.
Do you think that might happen when you speak to Mike?
No, not at all.
Not at all.
We both, we're both roughly of the same range.
I'm a little older than him, but not by that much.
I mean, when it comes to intellectual history.
To us, I mean, in terms of intellectual history,
you're a lot higher in the intellectual history hierarchy.
So...
I appreciate your thoughts.
It's a little harder for us to look at it from a very,
from that objective standpoint.
It's quite tough to see you as equals.
Even though Michael is amazing.
He's wonderful.
Amazing guy.
Yeah.
No, I agree with you.
And I should say in this, in this conference we were in,
it was actually a conference about teleology.
And I'm quite a critic of what people have called teleonomy.
My logic of teleodynamics, as I call it, is an attempt as,
and I should say there's a recent paper that just came out with another philosopher
that just came out in Synthese, that basically,
and I can send it to you if you'd like,
that's basically an argument that says,
now it's time to get teleology back into biology,
to recognize that it's real teleology,
that teleology is not unrelated to,
and necessarily related to, representationalism.
That is, teleology is about accomplishing a represented future.
But a represented future is, doesn't exist yet.
So the question is, you have to have a theory of representation.
You have to have a semiotic theory,
to have a teleological theory.
And to have a semiotic theory, you need a teleological theory.
They're necessarily,
because they're both about this relationship of presence to absence.
And so teleonomy was an attempt to sort of escape that aspect of teleology
that, you know, developed in the 1940s and 50s,
that basically said,
let's look at this stuff just like thermostats.
Thermostats look like they have an end.
You know, they're organized so that they'll achieve some sort of end stage.
It's as though they've got a tendency to go there.
I think that's radically different than the fact that you and I had planned
and thought about having this conversation,
and eventually made it happen.
This conversation that we're having now
didn't determine what happened in the past.
It's not the future causing the past.
You know, it's not backwards causation.
It's something else.
It's representation causing something to come into being.
But a representation is not exactly something present.
And that's the challenge.
So what was really necessary, I think,
is this is why I begin from Peirce,
even though I say I disagree with Peirce in many respects,
that in effect, this is a really basic question.
How is it that representation relationships come into the world?
And they don't exist without life, as far as I can tell.
I think you need something like life precisely because it has this strange loop,
epistemological, ontological entanglement that allows,
not just allows, but forces the future to be an issue.
I haven't even touched on the questions I've prepped for this.
But while you're on that topic, Terence,
when you looked at people, when you looked up to people like Dan,
Douglas Hofstadter, when they were writing their book,
Strange Loops,
Gertelage and Bach,
what were your thoughts?
Were you looking at this bacteria to Bach and Bach versus Gertelage and Bach,
thinking, OK, these two are on different parts,
but one person's more right than the other?
What are your thoughts on that?
Well, I think that I ought to be clear.
I don't think that Doug Hofstadter,
and I don't know him personally at all.
And so what I'm about to say,
you can take with a grain of salt in that respect.
But he's thinking of it in the purely formal sense.
I like to make a distinction between what I like to call
Gertelian logic and Escherian logic for M.C. Escher.
Now, he puts M.C. Escher and Gertel together, right?
Gertel's logic is a logic that's within logic.
That is, there's no materiality to Gertel's story.
OK, he shows that self-referential relationships,
ultimately what would have been called in those days
logical-type relationships can't fully be separated,
that you always get this sort of self-referential problem.
And what Gertel proved that Russell tried to escape
in the early part of the 20th century
was that you can't actually ever rule out this possibility
in any formal system that's well-developed.
You can't rule out this sort of self-referential
liar's paradox-like logic that undermines consistency
or completeness, as we'll probably get to
when we talk about incompleteness
in the incomplete nature sense.
But that's a logical argument that says that
in a formal system, just a formal system,
you're stuck with this problem.
M.C. Escher played with these kinds of relationships as well.
And, of course, Doug Hofstadter plays with them as well.
But M.C. Escher has only one piece of artwork
that actually captures what I would call the Asherian paradox.
It's not a Gerdelian paradox.
It's more troublesome than a Gerdelian paradox.
So M.C. Escher has this one image,
and you may know of it,
and if not, I'll consent it to you so you can notice it,
where this guy is standing, looking out a window at a scene.
And I think it's in maybe Barcelona or something like that,
looking at a scene.
And if you look at the way the picture is organized,
it's twisted around so that he's actually looking
at the scene in which he's a part.
Now, that's what we're doing, right?
And that's this entanglement of the epistemological,
what I know, what I see, what I experience,
with the ontological, what I am.
They're entangled in a way that can't be disentangled.
That's what I call an Asherian paradox.
It's one step more complex than the Gerdelian story.
It's more complex because it involves the very medium itself
that the formal relationships are laid out in.
Kurt Gödel didn't have to worry about that.
He's just worried about mathematics.
But we living creatures are in this Asherian world.
It's an Asherian paradox.
It's this paradox that Descartes tried to separate off
because paradox is so troublesome.
You know, it undermines itself.
It forces incompleteness.
So that's, in a sense, the difference.
And so what I would say is I think that both Doug,
even in his discussions of this in his later works
and certainly in the stuff that he did with Dan early on,
it was all at this level of logic.
And as a result, I think, still under the shadow of Descartes.
Yeah, it's quite difficult to escape Descartes' prison,
as Keith calls it.
Terence, I've got so many questions prepared for you
just to briefly outline the first three.
One's about absence as causal power.
The other one is about thermodynamics and self-organization.
And the other is about teleodynamics and normativity.
Let's start with the first one.
How do you actualize the causal power of absential features
in the emergence of mind and consciousness?
And how does this differ from traditional materialistic causation?
Well, so the issue is that representational relationships,
no matter how we think about them,
are about something present in relation to something that's not present.
But in a deeper sense,
that is, what's present to my thoughts in our conversation
are not part of the materiality.
They're not directly embodied in any of it.
And if my words have affected your thinking,
they're also not embodied in the neurological activity.
The meaning is not in the neurological activity.
The neurological activity is just another physical process,
like my sounds,
like the electrons that are connecting us
through the web, through the World Wide Web here.
It's not what it's about either.
The meaning is not in my head,
not in your head.
And it's not necessarily between us,
but it's in all the things
that are constrained from happening,
in all the absent features.
So, think about my,
I begin, I think the second chapter,
it's actually chapter one,
in Incomplete Nature,
with this little bit of the Tao Te Ching,
the number 11 in the standard version.
And I tried to translate it in a number of ways,
looking at lots of people.
I'm not anyone that knows Chinese.
But I just simply looked at lots of Chinese examples
and came up with my own translation.
But it basically runs this way.
He says, you know, it begins with,
he says, 30 spokes converge to the wheel's hub.
But it's the emptiness that allows the wheel to turn.
We carve, no, we shape,
the flame of vessels.
What's that?
The absence has a causal power in itself.
Yeah, but notice it's a special kind of causal power.
And this is why I think it's important to see.
So, we shape vessels out of clay,
but it's the empty space
that they surround
that is why we create these.
We carve doors and windows
into our buildings
in order to gain access
in order to gain access
to the emptiness that they protect.
And he ends with this really interesting statement.
He says,
we profit
from what is there,
but we gain use from what is not there.
Now,
so the point of this is
use is not something that's there.
The function of my car
is not in my engine.
It's not even in the movement of the car.
It's the use of the car
and the engine
and all that together
to accomplish something else.
There's none of those things.
The essence of the use
is something that's absent,
but it's that precisely that absence
which has shaped the design of cars.
It's precisely the absence
that has shaped the structure of a wheel
with an empty space in its hub.
And
the point there
is that
the constraints
or the things that are not there
are the way that we talk about
the shape
or the form
of what is there.
But it's
the what is not there
that determines
what is there
in an interesting way.
But we have,
but what is there
has to be made somehow.
And this is again
where teleodynamics,
where thermodynamics
is going to come into the role
because to make something
physically happen,
to constrain something
from happening
takes work,
takes effort.
Sorry to interrupt you,
but my next question
literally is
can you elaborate
on how
you linked
thermodynamic processes
to emergence of life,
mind,
through concepts
like morphodynamics
and teleodynamics?
So I think this would be
a great way for you.
Huge concept.
But let's talk about it.
I mean,
first of all,
one of the insights
behind this
we all know this
even though
we've never put it
into words.
Stu Kaufman,
one of my friends
Stu Kaufman
came up with
this phrase
in a piece
that he wrote
with a bunch of friends
a number of years ago.
He said that,
you know,
to do work
we need to constrain
the release of energy.
But to produce constraints
we need to do work.
What's really
is a thermodynamic
assessment
of the concept
of work.
The constraints
to keep something
from happening
takes work.
You've got to resist
something.
But it's precisely
because you're resisting
something
that work
can make something
else happen.
So the fact
that the pistons
in your internal
combustion engine
don't allow
the expansion
of gases
to go
in any direction
just one direction
you can use
that constraint
to move
something else
against the
second law
of thermodynamics
to drive your car
uphill
for example.
You can use
the thermodynamics
in one level
to reverse
the thermodynamics
in another system.
We use
in a sense
the increase
of entropy
in one system
to decrease
the entropy
in another system
oftentimes.
This is what we call
thermodynamic work.
but
to decrease
the entropy
to add form
to regularize
or to push
something
against this tendency
takes work.
And so
what this says
is that
if
it takes
constraints
on the release
of energy
to do work
and it takes
work to generate
constraints
those constraints
can now be used
to do other work.
the point
I want to make
here is
this is this
relationship
between constraints
and energy
and the release
of energy
and what work
is
that if you
can generate
constraints
with work
since work
takes constraints
to do something
the new constraints
that are generated
might be able
to do a new
kind of work.
work.
So the key
to evolution
to life
to thinking
to all of this
is just this
very trivial
idea
that
if you can
generate
work
to produce
some kinds
of constraints
if those
are slightly
different
or have
some other
features
than the
constraints
that were
originally
necessary
you can now
use those
constraints
to do work.
In each step
there's a loss
of capacity
to do work.
We know
that
you know
continual
non-loss
motion
is impossible
so that
there's always
some loss
in the capacity
to do work
but think
about driving
your car
up the hill
now
I can attach
it
to
a stump
that I want
to remove
and use
the weight
of my car
rolling downhill
to pull
the stump
out of the ground.
You know
I can do work
on one system
to create
constraints
this potential
energy
that the car
has now
to do work
on another
system
and so on
and so forth
and so forth
but what that
means is
that constraints
can not only
be created
one after the
other after the
other by doing
work
but they can
produce new
kinds of work
continuously
produce new
kinds of work
new kinds
of work
can come
from previous
work
and if we
recognize
that information
is always
contained
in constraint
in the form
then we
realize
that this
is the key
to information
too
when I talk
about evolution
and how
genes
pass on
something
in the future
what are they
passing on
not chemistry
not work
but they're
passing on
constraints
certain things
that can't
happen
life works
by virtue
of the
things
that are
not allowed
so
this guy
I once heard
you mention
the fact
that you
don't
you mentioned
Dawkins
earlier
but you
don't see
it as the
selfish gene
but rather
you see
it as the
lazy gene
this is
yes
that's a great
way to
conceptualize
this whole
process
of this
absence
of constraint
this constraint
absence
is important
to
properly
in fact
my current
work is
all about
that
in a totally
different domain
I'm interested
in what amounts
to the
complement
to natural
selection
natural selection
is a subtractive
process
it removes
things
you gotta
add things
now it was
thought for a long
time
all you're adding
is new
variation
the problem
that was
captured in
what we were
just talking
about
is variations
are always
variations
of something
something
has to be
generated
those variations
are constraints
or loss
of constraints
that are
passed on
as work
is done
so there's
a whole
side of
natural
selection
that we
tend to
ignore
we only
think about
it again
in the
cartesian
sense
blind
variation
and
retention
of something
you eliminate
things
that you've
created
blindly
no
yes
blindly
to their
form
but work
had to be
done
you know
this is a
thermodynamic
process
natural
selection
is ultimately
a thermodynamic
process
life has
to generate
excess
in order
to be able
to eliminate
something
we tend
to think
of natural
selection
without
actually
paying
attention
to the
work
and what's
the work
doing
it's generating
constraints
I'm an
organism
that is far
from equilibrium
very unstable
situation
in the natural
world
precisely because
all these
systems that
make me up
are constraining
the possible
chemistry that
can go on
so that
a vast
vast majority
of the things
that could
happen
with the
chemical
features of
my body
don't happen
they're kept
from interacting
with each other
in certain ways
or certain
things are made
very probable
that would have
been improbable
otherwise
the work
of staying
alive
is the work
of constraining
things
of keeping
things from
happening
when I
stop living
when my
organism
ceases
to do
all of
this stuff
all those
constraints
are being
released
loss of
chemistry
can now
happen
that couldn't
have happened
when I was
alive
or in which
my body
is preventing
from happening
in some
respects
it's not
that I've
lost
life
but that
the chemistry
has gained
freedom
that it
didn't have
life
is this
process
of generating
constraints
and maintaining
constraints
sorry
for interrupting
you there
Terrence
no no
it's alright
one of my
questions
further down
the line
was the
role of
constraints
it was
could you
elaborate
how constraints
which are
inherently
absences
can lead
to creation
of complex
goal-directed
systems
and how
this differs
from more
reductionist
explanations
of life
and consciousness
I thought
I'd just
bring that
up now
since you've
already
sort of
touched
on that
alright
well
interesting
if you
think
about
constraint
and
reductionism
there's
an interesting
problem
if there's
stuff
if something
is made
up of
multiple
things
that are
stuck
together
you can
now say
okay
now let me
go down
to look
at the
parts
look at
the parts
to those
parts
look at
the parts
to those
parts
okay
so
stuff
you know
has parts
constraints
don't have
parts
things that
are absent
don't have
smaller absences
that they're
made of
those constraints
are always
at a particular
level
and so
and so
when you
go down
a step
a reductionistic
step
you basically
throw away
those constraints
at the upper
level
and you say
okay
irrespective
of those
constraints
what's going
on down
here
oh wait
I can go
down one
more
let me throw
those constraints
away and go
down one
more level
now I've
got you know
atoms
interacting
now I've
got particles
interacting
now I've
got quarks
and gluons
interacting
what's missing
from all
of that
well all
the constraints
on all
those levels
up above
those constraints
aren't doing
something to
change what's
going on down
below
they're not
acting in
an efficient
sense to
say okay
I've got
constraints on
top and
they're making
the things
down on
the bottom
do what
they need
to do
no no
they just
emerge at
that level
by virtue
of the fact
that some
things stop
happening
some things
become less
and less
likely at
a lower
level and
as a result
at this
next level
up things
are constrained
so I'm
not an
advocate of
what people
call top
down causality
I don't
think there's
such a thing
as top
down causality
but I also
don't think
there's an
easy way to
think about
bottom up
causality
I think
causality
happens at
levels
differently
because
different kinds
of constraints
different kinds
of
absences
become
available
become
possible
at different
levels
and they
cannot be
reduced
to each
other
so
emergence
is not
about
the bottom
producing
something
above it
it's about
again
this idea
that
this stuff
just falls
into place
I think
at this
point
it's important
to recognize
the fact
that
emergent
properties
and physicalism
in general
your framework
is slightly
different
in the sense
that you
talk about
what is
called
causal
emergence
do you
want to
perhaps
define
what that
is
and how
it
differentiates
from
everyone's
day-to-day
understanding
what emergence
is as a
phenomenon
so first
of all
my view
of emergence
is like
the term
characterizes
it's a
process
you've got
to do
something
and doing
something
is important
it's not
just that
consciousness
is this
higher order
thing
no it's
done
it's produced
there's work
involved
so my
story is
all about
work
in fact
in my
book
Incomplete
Nature
I think
the most
important
chapter
and the
least
well
developed
from my
perspective
is a
chapter
I call
work
because we
take it
for granted
and we
don't recognize
how absolutely
crucial it
is
when I want
to talk
about
causality
I'm almost
always talking
about work
okay
and what
that means
is if I'm
talking about
semiotic
causality
causality
by representation
work has
to be
involved
it's
it's not
something
that lacks
work
this is
why
it escapes
the
Cartesian
problem
if you
bring work
into the
story
you have
to bring
constraint
into the
story
and
if
representations
are always
captured
by constraints
by the
form
that's
determined
by what's
by the
degrees of
freedom
that are
not
evident
that are
absent
then
that's
why a
representation
can be
causal
because it
constrains
work
it's a
constraint
on work
if a
representation
is
constraint
if the
transfer
of constraint
from
one substrate
to another
substrate
to another
substrate
is what
information
about
something
actually
is
then of
course
it can
do work
to have
an effect
in the
world
because it's
in the
world
it's the
absence
side of
what's
in the
world
but it's
in the
world
presence
and absence
are necessary
parts of
each other
let me
give you
my favorite
example of
this
I was just
going to
say I
think the
best way
to do
this is
actually
for you
to give
one of
those
examples
because I
know you
have quite
a few
that
explain
so beautifully
so this
is one
that you
know
working in
the laboratory
has been
the case
for my
work for
years
which has
to do
with genetic
information
we now
have tools
where we can
analyze the
structure of a
gene
so I
analyze the
structure of
a particular
gene for
a particular
substrate
one that I've
been very much
interested in
is the gene
that produces
the enzyme
that converts
glucose to
ascorbic acid
in a lot of
creatures
that was
originally
sequenced by
a group in
Japan in
the mid 90s
they published
this sequence
in a bunch
of research
papers
and it's
been of course
copied in
other research
papers
and how's
it been
copied
well the
sequence of
nucleotides
is captured
in A's
G's
C's
and T's
in a long
list of A's
G's
C's
and T's
in a
particular
order
and it's
been published
in other words
this thing
that was
originally
nucleotides
actual
molecules
in some
animal's
body
in some
cell's
DNA
is now
in print
as A's
G's
C's
and T's
and one
article
produces it
another guy
looks at it
picks it up
and says
I'm going to
put that
into my
paper
so 10
years goes
by
it's passed
from paper
to paper
I pick it
up and I
say oh
here's a nice
sequence
this is really
interesting
and you know
we've learned
a lot about
why it's not
there in humans
why it's
messed up
in humans
but I
can now
take this
sequence
and use
now my
gene
sequencer
my machine
and I
can take
the A's
G's
C's
and T's
that were
in typographics
ink on
paper
you know
and eventually
transmitted by
electronic media
that I picked
it up
by downloading
the paper
and now put
it into my
sequencer
produce the
gene
and stick
the gene
in an
organism
by
now
what's
happened
here
what have
I transferred
have I
transferred
A's G's
C's
and T's
have I
transferred
actual
molecules
no
just
constraint
the key
is that
constraint
so long
as I
can
encode
and decode
it
back to
where it
was
reground
it
so long
as those
constraints
are passed
on
without
error
I've
produced
the same
gene
and the
gene
will
produce
ascorbic
acid
in this
animal's
body
that I've
inserted
it into
now it's
not been
done
nobody could
do that
at this
point in
time
but it's
feasible
with the
tools we
have now
and we've
now done
this with
many many
genes
and many
organisms
oftentimes
just single
celled
organisms
but we're
really good
at taking
genes from
one place
now
getting the
sequence
and then
using that
sequence to
reproduce the
molecule and
put that
molecule somewhere
else and let
it do its
work
so this
shows you
that the
information
the information
is in the
constraints
the only thing
that's been
maintained
across here
are those
constraints
and the
interpretation
of those
constraints
so we're
using in a
sense
it's this
idea of
you might
say
encryption
you've got
to have
the right
decryption
system
to get it
back
literally
but that's
what these
two machines
are doing
encryption
and decryption
so to
speak
but that
tells us
that information
that aboutness
what it's
aboutness
is and
therefore
what its
causality
is
is captured
in the
constraints
it's also
similar to
the
you have
you have
one tell
where you
talk about
for example
different ape
species in
our brains
evolution of
our brains
and you
also talk
about
different
species
how
all the
information
is there
they've
got all
the access
to all
the data
that's
needed
to have
these
experiences
however
it's what
we don't
do
that make
us
different
from what
they don't
do
which is
pretty cool
when you
think about
it
yeah
yeah
yeah
and of
course
my early
work
in comparing
brains
anatomy
of brains
was to
recognize
early on
in the
1980s
in my
PhD work
I
couldn't
actually
we didn't
have the
tools to
find this
out
but I
couldn't
actually
identify
except for
how big
things were
what's
different
about the
connectivity
in a monkey's
brain
and a human
brain
in precisely
the areas
that we
thought
we were
fairly sure
at the
time
were involved
in producing
language
you know
these areas
in the left
hemisphere
named for
their
discoverers
Broca
and Wernicke
I was looking
at the
connections
between them
we finally
had the
ability
to use
tracer
molecules
to find
the
connections
and I
was sure
I was
going to
be able
to find
the
anatomical
reasons
why humans
could do
what they
could do
and monkeys
couldn't
do this
well
no
no
I didn't
find that
and in
fact
it wasn't
until
now
15 years
later
20 years
later
that
I'd done
this work
in monkeys
that people
finally had
the tools
using
what we
call
tractography
using
fMRI
in which
you could
actually get
a rough
idea of
what the
connections
actually
were
in the
human
brain
and by
golly
the monkey
brain
predicted
it
so it
was a
conundrum
you know
why the
human brain
was not
was able
to do
this
and the
monkey
brain
wasn't
they had
the same
connections
in fact
the genetics
are almost
identical
so genetics
won't help
us out
here
either
in fact
yeah
it's one
of these
things where
there's new
information
emerging
somehow
in this
process
but it's
not in a
trivial sense
as you say
it has more
to do with
what's not
there than
what is
there
exactly
so for
like anyone
listening
who's not
completely
understanding
what we're
saying
or what
Terence
is talking
about
is that
all the
information
is there
but it's
what we're
holding back
on
or what
we're
stopping
and putting
constraints
on
that is
making us
as smart
as we
are
because
otherwise
the neurochemistry
the neurobiology
it's all
very similar
it's not like
you can look
at a
chimp's brain
and think
okay
a human's brain
has this
much more
that's going
to predict
better behavior
or thought
processes
it's actually
now that
we have
a better
system
that constrains
our variables
that allow
us to have
these experiences
which is
very different
from what we
often think
about
when we
think
complexity
complexity
to us
is give
more
therefore
you have
more
whereas here
we're saying
actually
control more
and you have
more
right
and control
is of course
constraining
so that's
the challenge
in all this
and it's
a kind
of interesting
sort of
mental reversal
that you
have to do
it's not
easy
very
counterintuitive
and so
we often
and I would
say that
you know
I've mostly
in my career
not been able
to think
this
it takes
a lot
of effort
to say
now wait
a minute
let me
look at
the other
side
of this
before I
jump
to
conclusions
and this
is one
of the
reasons
why I
said a
few
minutes
ago
that I
think
we've
had this
problem
with the
theory of
evolution
itself
we have
not been
able to
look at
the
absential
side
of it
or rather
in terms
of natural
selection
we've only
seen the
subtractive
side
of it
and not
actually
understood
that you
know
there's
this
emergent
side
something
needs
to be
generated
and once
you have
it
generated
how is
it
generated
the
interesting
thing
is
variation
it's
just
an
expression
of the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
things
that are
not
preserved
by
natural
selection
just
tend
to
degenerate
they tend
to
but it
turns out
that the
degenerative
process
is what's
driving
complexity
it's almost
like a
complexity
is merely
the constraints
of simplicity
okay
does that
fit what
you're talking
about in a
sense
well
yeah
I'm not
sure
I have to
think about
what you
just said
okay
but
nevertheless
telodynamics
and normativity
your theory
your overall
research
posits that
telodynamics
give rise to
normative
properties
like purpose
and function
so how do we
reconcile this
with the fact
that
very good
question
traditionally
seen as
beyond the
scope of
physical
science
so
so
what I
tried to
do
in my
book
incomplete
nature
and it's
really right
in the
middle of
the book
it's where
I tried
to get
to
and then
from the
middle
I tried
to say
what are
the implications
of this
in the
last half
of the
book
the middle
of the
book
is about
how do
you
generate
life
I think
we've been
distracted
by a number
of things
but one
of the
things
that's
distracted
us a lot
has to
do
with the
fact
that
life
seems
to
reverse
what we
think
is
the
necessary
structure
of the
universe
the second
law of
thermodynamics
things tend
to get
more mixed
up over
time
and
constraints
tend to
get lost
over time
they get
eliminated
just
a spontaneous
tendency
of the
universe
so
when we
look at
living
processes
that are
not only
in our
own
lives
but
certainly
across
the
whole
history
of
evolution
been
generating
new
constraint
new
complexity
new
organization
it seems
to be
going
against
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
so
this
was a
conundrum
and in
fact
it was
I think
really
brought
out
intensely
in
the
early
1940s
by
the
quantum
theorist
Irving
Schrodinger
in his
What is
Life
pointing out
that
well
you know
living
things
do
something
weird
they
produce
what
he used
the term
neg
entropy
I've
never
liked
the
term
there's
no
entropy
is
just
a
measure
of
something
you
can't
have
a
negative
measure
of
something
but
anyway
it's
the
idea
of
something
that's
the
opposite
of
the
sort
of
tendency
to
go
towards
mess
as a
result
when we
began
to
get
excited
and
some
of
the
work
was
done
by
a
guy
named
Ilya
Prigogine
about
non-equilibrium
thermodynamics
seeing
that there
are some
processes
that
actually
can
produce
more
and
more
order
over
time
my
favorite
example
actually
since I
was a
youngster
were snow
crystals
snow
crystals
grow
spontaneously
and they
have
incredibly
symmetric
hexagonal
form
and they
have an
almost
infinite
variety
of these
it's not
infinite
not infinite
not every
snow
crystal
is
absolutely
different
than every
other one
but there
are themes
and variations
in snow
crystals
but in
any
case
these
are
processes
that
spontaneously
generate
order
and how
do they
generate
order
well of
course
they're
causing
water
molecules
that are
sort of
in
brownian
motion
in the
air
to
attach
to
this
lattice
form
and to
grow
and they
growing
by virtue
of
giving
up
heat
you know
when these
molecules
attach
to the
growing
crystal
lattice
they
spread
their
heat
into the
system
they lose
their
heat
and it
gets
radiated
into
the
world
it's
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
process
but
because
of
the
changes
in
pressure
humidity
and
temperature
you get
slightly
different
patterns
of
crystalline
attachment
but of
course
the
snow
crystal
disperses
the
heat
evenly
in all
directions
that's
number
one
and so
it's
radially
symmetric
it
it's
got a
number
of
other
features
and that
is
at
certain
temperatures
and
humidities
and
pressures
you'll
grow
sheets
or
spires
or
prisms
in the
system
and so
that as
the snow
crystal
falls
through
different
temperature
humidity
and
pressure
zones
it
accumulates
new
molecules
in a
different
pattern
so
it's
basically
a
memory
of how
it was
formed
this
is a
process
that's
far
from
equilibrium
what's
happening
is it's
far from
equilibrium
becoming
regularized
because
it's
dumping
its heat
of acquiring
molecules
as fast
as possible
the most
efficient way
it can
dump
the heat
is
the most
direct
route
out
and so
whenever you
see something
organizing
itself
it's doing
so in
in order
to dump
thermodynamics
to dump
the heat
or you
know
reduce
the entropy
out into
the world
as fast
as possible
and the
way to
do that
is to
take the
straightest
possible
route
the most
direct
possible
route
well if
you're a
crystal
that route
may be
you know
following
branches
or it
may be
following
sheets
or something
like that
if you're
a whirlpool
it's molecules
not bumping
into each
other
molecules
that are
moving
in laminar
flow
so if
you're
emptying
your
bathtub
and you
see a
whirlpool
forming
if you
reach your
hand down
there and
you stir
it up
and you
mess
it up
you never
allow it
to form
the bathtub
will drain
slower
because the
whirlpool
is the
most efficient
way
the most
straightforward
way for
water
molecules
to leave
the bathtub
following
the draw
of gravity
self-organizing
processes
like this
are processes
that are
always in
the process
of dissipating
energy
in the
most direct
way possible
typically
they form
almost
exclusively
in very
high
gradient
conditions
in which
there's a
tendency for
things to
flow very
rapidly
my other
favorite
example are
what we
call
bernard
convection
cells
these
little
hexagonal
convection
cells that
develop in
thin oil
typically
if heated
from below
if you
heat oil
a little
bit
the heat
gets dissipated
into the air
by what we
call conduction
that is
molecules
bumping into
each other
and of course
heat is
a reflection
of the
velocity of
molecular
movement
but at
some point
if you
really heat
it up
to a high
heat
bumping
into each
other
at random
is just
not
an easy
way to
dump
that heat
out
the heat
is going
to accumulate
faster
and you're
getting rid
of it
so what
happens
is that
the hotter
molecules
that are
bumping
into each
other
laterally
don't move
much
so heat
stays there
those that
are moving
vertically
move the
heat out
of the
system
more rapidly
more efficiently
so that
as the
gradient of
heat
builds up
what you
get is
convection
cells that
form these
hexagonal
cells of
upward
dwelling
hot
molecules
and
downward
flowing
cooler
molecules
downward
flowing
because they're
heavier
because they're
more dense
than the
ones that
are going
up
and you
get this
regularization
incredible
regularization
it's getting
rid of the
heat as
fast as
possible
to keep
it going
you need
to continually
heat it
because it's
dumping the
heat as
fast as
possible
like the
bathtub is
dumping the
water as
fast as
possible
under those
constraints
now what's
interesting is
that each of
those processes
because they
generate order
have been
looked at to
say well
life generates
order
life is
like this
maybe we
can say
life is
just self
organization
the problem
is maybe
in part the
word self
organization
because there's
no self
there
there's no
self that's
saying do
it this way
we're using
the term to
say it's
just not
externally
imposed
the form
yeah
so
so I
I said
let's
let's change
the term
let's call
it morphodynamic
it's a
dynamical process
that tends
towards form
but to tend
towards form
it's got to be
thermodynamically
unstable
and how do
you make a
thermodynamically
unstable system
well the
the convection
cell story
that I just
told is a
good one
you've got to
have something
flowing in
and something
flowing out
whether it's
water in your
bathtub or
the heat
in these
systems
something coming
in something
going out
and in fact
once it's
pushed me on
a certain
level
to move
what's coming
in out
as fast as
possible
you need to
regularize
the flow
regularizing
it means
taking the
straightest
possible
path
the simplest
possible
path
the most
direct
possible
path
that turns
to be
regular
that's
orderly
we consider
it orderly
so when we
see something
that spontaneously
generates order
we go
wow that's
unusual
that's a
surprise
that's something
exciting
and we look
at life
and we say
well life
is all about
that
so life
must just
be self
organization
here's the
problem
self-organizing
processes
destroy
the very
conditions
that produce
them
as fast
as possible
as soon
as the
water is
drained
from the
tub
it's
gone
you know
as soon
as the
snow crystal
falls to
the ground
or can't
go any
further
or goes
into
a warm
area
it no
longer
continues
it's
these are
processes
that
dispose
of their
boundary
conditions
as fast
as possible
that's
precisely
why they
become
ordered
but it's
precisely
the problem
with life
these are
processes
that like
the second
law of
thermodynamics
I like
to call
terminal
processes
they run
until they
maximize
some value
yes
okay
you call
it that
maximum
entropy
production
yes
in fact
this has
been the
standard way
they call
it the
maximum
entropy
production
principle
it's not
about
just
increasing
and producing
entropy
it's about
producing
it as
fast as
possible
it's a
slight
misnomer
because what's
actually happening
is you've got
to generate
an offload
entropy
as fast
as you're
unloading
a reduction
of entropy
so
reduction
and you know
calling it
entropy
is confusing
gets people
confusing
think about
it as
heat
so we're
dumping
heat
into the
system
pumping
heat
into the
system
and the
system
is offloading
heat
as fast
as it
can
okay
the key
is that
it will
not go
faster
than a
certain
level
once
the amount
of input
and the amount
of output
are equalized
it's stable
it will
continually
look that
way
so long
as you're
dumping
heat
into the
system
and dumping
heat
out into
the
environment
it'll be
organized
as much
as it
can
to sort
of
equalize
the input
output
relationship
it's not
closed
it's a
completely
open
system
in this
respect
both
open
to input
and open
to output
but that's
what gets
it regularized
the problem
is as soon
as the heat
is gone
or as soon
as it uses
up the
heat
the process
will stop
life is
something
interesting
life has
to use
self-organizing
processes
to generate
its order
this is the
way that
that work
like heat
can generate
order
it
forces things
to become
regularized
it constrains
the movement
of molecules
it constrains
the chemistry
of molecules
as a result
life has
to depend
upon
self-organizing
processes
or what I
call
morphodynamic
processes
but it also
has to
stabilize
promote
those self-organizing
processes
and keep
them
from running
to their
end
so I'm
a process
I'm continually
actively doing
stuff
dumping energy
in in the
form of
oxygen
and food
and doing
work
chemical work
to keep
things going
I've got to
keep it going
but in fact
I can now
adjust
to how much
food
how much
oxygen
how much
work I'm
doing
all kinds
of ways
because the
system
has found
ways to
stabilize
this
the question
is how
do you
stabilize
these
self-destructive
processes
and the
answer is
you have
to pit
them against
each other
the answer
is the
only way
to do
that
is to
have
one
self-organizing
process
that
creates
the
constraints
that make
the other
self-organizing
process
possible
but also
keep it
from running
to the
end
so
one thing
I've
tried to
do
is to
is to
say
okay
what that
means
is
no
if
morphodynamics
is the
result
of
two
competing
thermodynamic
processes
heat going
in
heat going
out
then
maybe
life
is like
pitting
two
or more
morphodynamic
processes
against each
other
so
how would
that look
so I
came up
with a
fairly simple
model
system
and I've
elaborated
over the
years
since I
wrote
Incomplete
Nature
into a
much more
complicated
story
but
basically
I said
let's
just take
the two
most
common
chemical
processes
in living
systems
one is
called
catalysis
how
molecules
can make
other
chemical
processes
more
probable
these are
processes
that could
have
happened
but they're
very
improbable
how do
we make
them more
probable
catalysts do
this
molecules
that
themselves
don't get
modified
but they
aid the
others
in happening
a number
of decades
ago
Stuart Kaufman
sort of
pioneered this
idea that
you can
have
what were
considered
autocatalytic
sets
catalysts that
catalyze each
other and
produce each
other
I like to
call this
reciprocal
catalysis
there's
catalysts that
reciprocate
to produce
other
catalysts
they all
need
substrates
but they're
all in a
sense that
A produces
B which
produces A
which produces
B and so
on and so
forth
that's a
self-organizing
process
it's a
self-organizing
process
because by
doing that
you'll use
up the
substrates
faster and
faster and
faster until
they're all
gone and
no catalysis
can take
place and
so all the
catalysts will
diffuse away
from each
other all
the potential
substrates
will diffuse
away from
each other
it's a
self-organizing
process
the other
self-organizing
process that
we find
throughout
life
is what
sometimes
called
self-assembly
self-assembly
is basically
just
crystallization
molecules that
have particular
shape and
electrostatic
affinities with
each other
typically hydrogen
bond affinities
tend to form
stick together
and they stick
together in
clusters
crystals are
like that
they form
lattices
but you can
also form
sheets
snow crystals
are nice
sheets in
this respect
so crystals
can form
into sheets
and of course
to some
extent
all cells
are sheets
but I became
interested in a
much simpler
kind of
structure
the shell
of a virus
shells of
viruses are
mostly made
up of
proteins
and proteins
have interesting
three-dimensional
shapes that
are semi-regular
and the
regularity of
it means that
you can
stick a bunch
of them
together
and they
form sheets
that we
call
tessellations
it's like
taking a
bunch of
hexagons
and sticking
them next
to each
other
you can
fill space
with it
well it
turns out
that the
vast majority
of viruses
are made
up of
proteins
that stick
together
to form
polyhedrons
basically
containers
now it
turns out
that all
you need
to do
to produce
those
is of course
produce lots
of these
molecules
we call
these molecules
capsids
proteins
or capsids
they form
these little
capsules
so when a
virus invades
a cell
it does
two things
it takes
its DNA
or RNA
and it
uses it
to produce
more DNA
and more RNA
and it
uses some
of it to
produce more
of the
capsid
molecules
now the
capsids
tend to
form
into these
enclosures
and if you
produce lots
of RNA
and DNA
molecules
that are
viral
molecules
the capsules
will tend
to capture
these
and the
cell
will break
open
and spit
out these
capsules
full of
their DNA
and RNA
and they'll
go and
find another
cell
but what I
realized is
that you
could replace
the DNA
RNA
which makes
viruses
parasites
on cells
with
autocatalytic
processes
with reciprocal
catalysis
and that
reciprocal
catalysis
which makes
more
catalytic
molecules
if it
has a
side
product
if it
produces
yet one
of the
molecules
it produces
is not
just a
catalyst
but is
a capsid
molecule
then capsules
will form
where there's
the most
rapid
catalysis
happening
and will
tend to
capture
and close
the catalysts
that make
the capsule
possible
but which
also make
the catalysts
possible of
making each
other
what that
means is
the
catalytic
process
creates
the
permissive
conditions
for crystal
growth to
happen
what are
those permissive
conditions
as crystals
growth
grow or as
capsids form
capsules form
they use
up the
molecules
as a
crystal
grows
it will
grow to
the point
where the
concentration
of molecules
in the
surrounding
fluid
is such
that
it's as
likely that
they'll
attach
to the
structure
as will
detach
and so
it'll stop
growing
it reaches
an equilibrium
point
that's in a
sense the
termination
process of
this self
organizing
process of
any crystal
growth
it goes
to a
point
where
the
concentration
has been
reduced
every time
you suck
a molecule
away
stick it
into the
polyhedral
shell
the
concentration
decreases
but if
you've got
a catalytic
process
going on
that's
generating
new
molecules
to replace
the ones
that are
taken up
that process
will continue
to grow
until the
capsule
closes
until the
capsule
is now
a fully
enclosed
structure
at that
point in
time
there's no
new
catalysis
that's going
to go on
because
it'll now
use up
all of
the
substrates
but all
the
catalysts
that are
necessary
to interact
with each
other
will be
trapped
together
similarly
if you
have an
autocatalytic
process
like this
a reciprocal
catalytic
process
if it's
not
enclosed
as I
mentioned
before
it'll
eventually
use up
all of
its
local
substrates
and all
the catalysts
that need
each other
that depend
on each
other
will diffuse
away
and you'll
no longer
have this
process
to run
but by
enclosing
them
in the
container
now you've
also produced
the both
permissive
conditions
and the
termination
blocking
conditions
the constraints
on ending
so to speak
that are
necessary to
keep the
catalysts
together
but now
if you break
open one of
these structures
if it
you know
for whatever
reason
for heat
or for
collision
breaks open
if it breaks
open in a
context where
there's new
substrates
catalysis will
pick up again
and capsid
formation will
pick up again
and it'll
repair itself
now you have
a system
that is in
a sense
self-repairing
it will change
molecules
it'll take in
new molecules
but it'll have
the same
capacity
what's maintained
over cycle
upon cycle
getting broken
open
reforming
broken open
reforming
is new
molecules will
be taken in
and all
molecules will
be dispersed
after a few
cycles of
this there's
no molecules
in common
and yet the
same structure
which I call
an autogenic
or self-reproducing
virus is still
there
the only thing
that's in common
is the constraints
that's all that's
been passed on
no molecules
no energy
is in common
but this is a
system that in a
sense creates
constraints that
balance each other
constraints or
boundary conditions
on these two
processes
two morphodynamic
processes
two processes
that by themselves
would terminate
themselves
what they've
created now
is a system
that is in a
sense got
termination
prevention
it keeps itself
from being
terminated
by keeping
its component
processes
from being
terminated
but to say
that is to say
that there's
now a target
it represents
itself
so to speak
in these
constraints
and therefore
it can reproduce
those constraints
in new
substrates
what this says
is that
replication
is not
at base
what's base
at base
is self
repair
it's capable
of in a sense
to some extent
remembering what
it was
before it was
damaged
even while
it's damaged
it has a
memory of it
but that memory
is not in any
individual molecules
it's in the
system of
constraints
that holds
all the system
together
so now I
realize that
in effect
when we see
that thing
being passed
on
repaired
and broken
repaired
and broken
passing on
constraints
that's effectively
like passing
on DNA
that a
molecule
could now
have actually
carried that
same information
in subsequent
work
I've shown
actually
how you
can go
from
a system
as simple
as this
it's a simple
thought experiment
interestingly enough
it's a
an empirical
thought experiment
we could do
this in the lab
nobody has done
this
I don't have
the facility
to do it
not only that
I think we'll
probably find
these eventually
I think there's
going to be
places on earth
and certainly
possibly on other
planets
where we're
going to
find what
I call
autogenic
viral structures
they're not
viruses
they're not
parasitic
because they
don't use
RNA or DNA
but they're
like viruses
because they
have the
structure of
a virus
I think we'll
find them
for example
deep in the
earth
where they're
not competing
against life
we'll find
them
I think we're
going to
find them
in petroleum
deposits
where there's
lots of
organic molecules
lots of
heat
we don't
know what
to look for
yet
so at the
lowest level
almost on the
planet
as deep down
as you can
get
yeah
when you talk
about this
concept of
autogenesis
it involves
self-catalyzing
systems that
give rise to
life
so what
are these
what are the
implications
on theories
of life in
general
when you think
about this
process
and what we
all discuss
every day
regarding the
origin
so I think
we've been
hoodwinked
by the
Darwinian
story here
Darwin
recognized
the last
line
of the
origin of
species
Darwin
recognizes
that
natural
selection
the theory
of natural
selection
cannot
explain
the origins
of life
he begins
this last
line by
saying
probably won't
get it right
here
but there's
oh shoot
there's
majesty
or something
I'm not
getting it
right
in this
this theory
of life
with its
several
powers
being breathed
into one
form into
many
and after
which the
earth goes
circling around
the sun
and that
natural
selection
produces
everything
most most
beautiful
and most
wonderful
have been
and will
be evolved
you know
that kind
of thing
but it
begins that
by saying
you know
these special
powers
these special
powers are
the powers
of self
repair
and ultimately
self
replication
but the
story that
I've just
told is
one that
says that
self
replication
is secondary
things that
just copy
themselves
eventually
get noisy
the second
law of
thermodynamics
wins
catastrophe
happens and
they stop
repair
just copying
is not
enough
you've got
to make
repairs
you've got
to remember
something
and so you
have to have
a system
that even
when damaged
even when
challenged
in a sense
has some
kind of a
representation
the key
is that
this is a
system
in which
the representation
is in the
form of
constraint
it's a
constraint
of the
relationships
between
these
constraint
generating
processes
it's a
system of
constraints
but
this is
why you
need this
third step
why it's
why life
is not
just
self
organization
life is
self
organization
organized
such that
it
keeps
itself
from
terminating
you might
say it's
termination
prevention
self
organization
is
termination
life is
termination
prevention
I'm spending
my whole
life doing
that
so to
speak
but
what that
says is
that this
story that
we have
today
that's
the
common
story
that we
think that
life begins
with replicating
molecules like
DNA or
RNA
can't be the
whole story
because replication
is first of
all not about
anything
it's not about
the new ones
that are going to
be created
the new ones
are not about
the old ones
they're just
copies of it
like a
molecule
in a chemical
reaction is like
the last molecule
produced in that
chemical reaction
eventually
even though it
uses a kind
of a template
copying mechanism
that template
process will
accumulate noise
and eventually
will not be
able to copy
you've got to
have this
kind of
termination
prevention
you've got to
have constraint
maintenance
and constraint
regeneration
as a possibility
here
what this
says is that
RNA and DNA
are late
processes
are late
accumulations
in the evolution
of life
they're not
what begins
it
you've got to
begin it
in this
systematic
constraint
relationship
it's a
thermodynamic
question
the thermodynamics
comes first
because there's
work involved
the thermodynamics
is the first
part of the
story
then
if thermodynamics
is organized
in the right
way
constraints
result
and those
constraints
can be
passed
from
substrate
to
substrate
to
substrate
if you've
got a
system
that
protects
and
reconstitutes
constraints
a memory
system
effectively
before we
take this
back to the
mind
so do you
then think
that this
thermodynamic
process
occurs
throughout
the universe
and is
not just
isolated
to earth
absolutely
but here's
the interesting
thing
to do
this you
need
pretty
complicated
molecules
small
molecules
probably
can't
do it
so well
I don't
know how
small
would be
a problem
but I
would say
that you
know
we know
that
viruses
on earth
are all
done
with
proteins
now part
of it
is probably
because
proteins
are made
by cells
and
DNA
or RNA
and ribosomes
and so on
to do
this whole
process
it may
be that
it's possible
with much
simpler
molecules
but not
too
simple
they have
to have
the geometry
to form
capsules
they have
to have
the geometry
to form
catalytic
processes
the question
is
to take
this
perspective
I'm not
starting
with anything
complicated
like a DNA
or RNA
molecule
this long
string
of very
unstable
nucleotides
how do you
generate nucleotides
is another
problem
but
the key
is that
this is a
process
that's
generic
any
fairly
complex
three-dimensional
kind of
molecule
that tends
to interact
in these
ways
with other
molecules
should be
able to
do this
the question
is
where do
large
complicated
molecules
like this
show up
polymers
how do
they get
generated
well we know
on earth
most polymers
are generated
by organic
processes
but are there
polymers
elsewhere
in the
solar system
yes
but it
turns out
that in
water
polymers
break down
pretty fast
water is a
bad place
to start
with polymers
where are
polymers being
produced
then
well it
turns out
that we
think that
probably
there's lots
of polymers
being produced
in the
outer
solar system
where
well think
about Titan
with its
methane
seas
methane
is a great
solvent
an organic
solvent
and one
of the
kind of
things
that can
be
dissolved
in it
is
hydrogen
cyanide
but hydrogen
cyanide
can form
interesting
polymers
complicated
structures
in which
HCN
stacks on
HCN
stacks on
HCN
and we
get this
sort of
CCN
CCN
CCN
backbone
of a
molecule
with
side chains
that are
also hydrogen
cyanide
like
but it
will now
have the
possibility
of folding
into an
interesting
and complicated
structure
that could
have
I don't
know that
it has
this
catalytic
and
self
assembling
capacities
but what
this says
is that
in context
where there's
no water
it may be
possible to
generate
fairly complicated
polymers
interestingly
enough
these very
cold
conditions
water is
like
like rock
effectively
and
nevertheless
it gets
captured
on
comets
that
grab
some
of the
materials
from
these
outer
planets
and
flying
into
the
inner
solar
system
and
they
dump
their
features
their
ice
and
their
molecules
on
the
inner
rocky
planets
that
are
warmer
what
happens
is
well
the
rock
the
ice
turns
to
liquid
containing
lots
of
these
complicated
polymers
I
actually
think
that
the
process
has
to
start
in
the
outer
solar
system
but
that
means
that
throughout
the
universe
I
think
the
raw
materials
for
autogenic
viral
like
structures
which
I
think
are
the
earliest
you
might
call
them
proto-life
structures
are
probably
pretty
widespread
in the
cosmos
because
I
think
there's
going
to
be
lots
of
ways
to
do
it
lots
of
kind
of
organic
molecules
that
can
do
this
but
only
when
they
come
into
inner
rocky
planets
that
are
much
warmer
where
chemical
reactions
can
go
much
faster
are
they
going
to
have
the
possibility
to
get
much
more
complicated
so
I
think
there's
going
to
be
lots
of
proto-life
in
the
cosmos
and
a
little
bit
of
life
you
know
it's
one
of
these
probability
issues
there's
going
to
be
you
know
hundreds
of
thousands
of
times
more
proto-life
out
there
and
once
in a
while
in
some
solar
systems
there's
going
to
be
life
now
the
life
will
be
a
little
different
in
each
case
I
think
there's
a
lot
of
constraints
on
why
it
can't
be
too
different
and
we
can
go
into
that
a
little
later
but
but
basically
my
argument
here
is
that
we're
not
so much
seeded
by
life
we're
seeded
by
this
sort
of
proto-life
that
then
can
begin
this
process
of
complexifying
it
complexifies
because
it
remembers
itself
and
that
when
things
change
they
get
modified
it
still
remembers
where
it
was
with
now
this
little
modification
remembers
that
modification
now
it's
an
it's
an
accretive
process
information
constraints
can
be
accreted
if
you
got
a
system
that
remembers
when
you
think
of
this
so
the
genetic
hierarchy
going
upward
or
downward
depending
on how
you
perceive
this
do
you
think
that
still
this
comes
down
to
one
fundamental
let's
say
atom
molecular
group
of
structures
that
have
come
together
or
you
think
this
is
just
happening
at
multiple
layers
different
parts
of the
cosmos
continuously
so
there
is
no
one
single
ancestor
there's
just
various
different
ones
that
will
get
so
I
think
clearly
on
earth
we're
going
to
find
that
at
least
at
some
point
we
can
go
back
to
Luca
a
last
universal
common
ancestor
interestingly
enough
Luca
we conceive
of today
as a
cell
that does
all the
things
that
cells
do
today
has
this
RNA
molecules
has
DNA
molecules
has
ribosomes
has
tRNA
messenger
RNA
all
this
stuff
no
there
had
to
be
a
lot
of
evolution
before
that
ever
happened
however
all
the
other
alternative
forms
got
replaced
you know
they didn't
do so
well
and
Luca
particular
way
of
doing
this
took
over
because
it's
the
most
efficient
way
it's
very
effective
I've
been
spending
a lot
of
time
on
what
I
call
the
pre
Luca
evolution
problem
that
is
how
do
you
get
this
complicated
system
where
you
got
you
know
so
for
example
to
produce
20
amino
acids
in
sequence
to
produce
a
protein
you
got
to
have
corresponding
transfer
RNA
molecules
for
each
one
of
them
you
got
to
have
a
molecule
that
attaches
the
amino
acid
to
a
particular
tRNA
molecule
by
virtue
of
its
antisense
end
these
are
called
amino
acyl
tRNA
synthetases
so
each
one
of
these
has
to
have
a
synthetase
that's
relevant
to
it
and
has
to
recognize
it
and
attach
a
protein
to
it
the
ribosome
itself
is
made
up
of
large
number
of
proteins
and
a
backbone
an
internal
backbone
of
RNA
molecules
that
are
specifically
organized
to
organize
the
proteins
of
the
ribosome
so
that
they
can
accept
tRNA
molecules
in
sequence
that
have
been
charged
with
these
amino
acyl
tRNA
synthetases
with
incredibly
complicated
process
how did
this come
about
and so
I've spent
a lot
of time
struggling
with this
if the
RNA
world
story
is not
a good
starting
point
how do
you get
there
how do
you get
to
how do
you get
to
LUCA
and I
think
one of
the stories
is you
have to
give up
the cell
story
you have
to go
back
to
something
simpler
like
a
virus
the
problem
is
we
think
of
viruses
not
as
alive
but
they
evolve
we
think
of
viruses
as
parasites
yes
my argument
is that
you don't
have to
think
of it
in those
terms
they don't
have to
be
parasites
they've
become
parasites
because
LUCA
this
LUCA
form
was
really
great
at
producing
stuff
so
take
advantage
of
it
and
so
now
the
only
place
we're
going
to
find
these
autogenic
viruses
is
places
where
there's
no
daughters
of
LUCA
so
where's
that
going
to
be
well
as
I
say
deep
in
the
earth
somewhere
maybe
you're
on
Mars
possibly
in the
atmospheres
of Jupiter
who knows
there's a
personality trait
there are
parasites
but
inherently
they were
never
considered
parasites
to
begin
with
that's
right
that's
right
so
the issue
is
that
we've
treated
viruses
poorly
even
us
as
doctors
when
I'm
treating
patients
and we're
talking
about
viruses
we still
define
it as
we don't
know
is this
life
we're not
sure
and there's
probably
vastly more
viruses
in the
world
than there
is any
kind of
cellular
creature
we know
that just
by the
statistics
when we
look down
the
bacteria
just
outnumber
us
so
vastly
and
viruses
almost
certainly
the
parasitized
bacteria
outnumber
bacteria
vastly
but they're
so hard
to detect
what are
your thoughts
on fungi
Terrence
fungi
whatever
people call
it
fungi
fungi
fungi
yeah
we're all
fungi
but
the issue
is of course
fungi
are one
of the
three
major
classes
of
multicellular
eukaryotic
organisms
so
I mean
there's a
lot of
interesting
stories to
be told
here
but
so
one
of my
favorite
books
from the
1980s
was by
a guy
named
Leo
Buss
I don't
know if
you know
this
he called
it
it was
the
evolution
of
individuality
and he
was interested
in
why
is it
that
there
are only
sort of
three
major
groups
of
what I
would
call
addicted
multicellular
organisms
now
by addicted
what do I
mean
they can't
any longer
be
unicellular
now
it turns
out that
there are
unicellular
fungi
they're
unicellular
animals
they're
unicellular
plants
algae
for example
or
or
hydra
but
paramecia
that sort
of thing
you know
animals and
plants are
single cell
but
multicell
creatures
multicellularity
has evolved
multiple
times
but it's
but it
mostly
is
what I
call
facultative
multicellularity
that is
in some
part of
the life
cycle
they're
a complex
like a
volvox
alga
and then
at other
parts of
the life
cycle
a single
cell
could be
on its
own
swimming
around
until it
finds
others
or until
it reproduces
into a
ball
but animals
like you
and I
we can't
do that
any longer
although we
have single
cell phases
of our
life cycle
you know
fertilized
ova
and plants
have
fertilized
ova
and fungi
have
fertilized
ova
in this
process
we do
it
differently
but the
reason
but the
question is
why do
we become
addicted
to have
we have
to have
a multicellular
part
in fact
you can
say that
our single
cellular
life cycle
is always
parasitic
on the
multicellular
part of
the life
cycle
that's
not true
for
volvox
for example
so in
effect
we got
stuck
we got
kind of
ratcheted
into this
situation
where we
can't go
back
what
leo
bus
conjectured
in the
mid 80s
well that
maybe
there's
sort of
a
do you
know
this
story
about
the
theory
of
justice
by
john
rawls
no
he called
it the
veil of
ignorance
problem
and he
said if
you want
to create
a
just
society
create it
so that
when people
come into
the world
they don't
have
knowledge
about
where
they're
going
to
show
up
that
is
what
if
you
know
that
you're
going
to be
part
of
the
royalty
you know
then
you've
got
a
bias
you can
always
take
advantage
of
that
bias
but
if
you
come
into
the
world
and
you
have
to
be
self
made
then
in a
sense
everybody's
got
an
equal
chance
so
to
produce
ignorance
he says
it's
an
abstract
idea
but
the
key
is
there's
a
kind
of
veil
of
ignorant
story
to
explain
how
these
groups
got
stuck
so
first
of all
the
key
is
that
where
is
the
self
interest
in
each
of
these
cells
well
it's
of course
in the
constraint
maintaining
part
the
DNA
and
RNA
of
these
systems
it
says
okay
here's
where
I've
got
this
where
I'm
going
to
be
how
I'm
going
to
adapt
to
the
world
and
so
on
all
of
my
information
is
here
the
key
is
how
do
you
keep
it
from
being
selfish
so
that
one
individual
cell
in the
population
can
take
advantage
of
the
others
you've
got
to
have
a
veil
of
ignorance
so
how
does
this
work
and
he
said
well
there's
there's
three
ways
that
it
can
work
and
they
seem
to
be
displayed
in
animals
plants
and
fungi
so
let's
look
at
plants
first
so
now
I've
got
one
cell
and
it
begins
to
produce
other
cells
the
problem
is
how
can
that
cell
determine
that
my
DNA
mine
alone
and
not
any
that's
been
varied
in
this
process
of
generating
other
cells
will
become
the
DNA
that
gets
passed
on
to
the
next
generation
well
for
a
plant
a
vascular
plant
like
a tree
or
bush
the
only
cells
that
can
reproduce
are
going
to
be
the
ends
of
branches
the
meristems
but
in a
plant
cells
can't
move
they
have
a
cell
membrane
that
has
a
cell
wall
around
it
that
gets
stuck
to
neighboring
cells
so
that
cell
that
starts
the
process
can't
decide
I'm
going
to
move
out
to
the
meristem
and
become
the
one
that
reproduces
so
wherever
a
cell
is
produced
it's
stuck
can't
determine
that
its
DNA
are
going
to
be
the
stuff
that
gets
passed
on
so
now
you're
required
to
cooperate
you
have
to
be
egalitarianism
here
we can
take
advantage
of that
by
grafting
some
plants
on top
of
other
plants
for
example
because
we
know
that
the
root
stock
won't
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
fruits
that's
produced
that
sort
of
thing
so
we
can
undermine
what
the
plant
has
got
stuck
here
this
is
why
the
plant
stuck
this
way
why
it
is
now
forced
to be
cooperative
with
each
other
all the
cells
have to
cooperate
to
produce
a
larger
integrated
organism
but now
let's
go to
fungi
what's
the story
with
fungi
fungi
have
very
leaky
cell
membranes
and
some
don't
even
have
cell
membranes
so
the
only
real
serious
membranes
are
the
membranes
around
the
nuclei
but
that
means
that
nuclei
can
move
around
oftentimes
in
this
sort
of
larger
pseudo
cell
as a
result
what you
see in
fungi
is very
little
tissue
differentiation
take a
mushroom
if I
eat the
veins
of a
mushroom
eat the
stem
of a
mushroom
eat the
cap
of the
mushroom
the
cells
are
effectively
the
same
cells
they all
taste
the
same
although
there's
some
differentiation
for the
most part
fungi
don't have
this capacity
to differentiate
their cells
very much
and as a
result
they're
fairly
morphologically
contiguous
each cell
is like
each other's
cell
but
this process
means
that
no set
of genes
because
the gene
products
get now
dispersed
among
everybody
else
I can't
determine
that locally
my little
group
are going
to be
the ones
that make
it
so that
when I
produce
a fruiting
body
like a
mushroom
that pops
up out
of the
ground
it's
whoever
was there
at the
time
it's
like
the
meristem
story
but in
this
case
it's
because
nobody
can
determine
the
local
environment
you know
it's
all
messed
up
so he
said
that's
another
way
to
produce
it
so
what's
the
story
with
animals
well
the
story
with
animals
is
you
do
it
a
third
way
and
that
is
the
and in
the
ovum
she
has
its
genes
producing
and her
genes
producing
a lot
of the
RNA
and protein
in that
system
it's already
there
it's already
doing its
work
now
the sperm
comes in
and fertilizes
this egg
now you've
got two
sets of
genes
its
individuality
is now
this
combination
of genes
but that
combination
is going
to take
a time
to produce
its own
proteins
its own
ribosomes
its own
RNA
so that
actually for
the first
many cell
divisions
of an
animal
embryo
it's
mother's
DNA
that has
determined
what's
happening
so now
the
individual
cells
it can't
determine
it
mom's
determined
it
so in
effect
mom has
said
now
you're
going to
you know
I'm going
to determine
who's
going to
be
a heart
cell
who's
going to
be a
nerve
cell
who's
going to
be
a gamete
cell
that can
reproduce
into the
future
that's
going to
be
determined
simply
by where
you are
when all
the cells
divide
is it
biological
let's
say
is there
pro to
this
is there
some
sort of
advantageous
theme
to this
occurring
or
does it
not matter
because
when you
look at
bacteria
and
viruses
they still
propagate
as much
if not
more
than
us
that's
right
that's
right
so what
I would
say
is that
this
is
just
a
kind
of
addiction
a kind
of ratchet
problem
once we
moved in
this
direction
you can't
go back
once your
single cell
phase
becomes
always
parasitic
on the
multi-celled
phase
you basically
can't go
back
and this
is actually
the theme
to the
book I'm
working on
now
which is
called
falling
up
but
basically
the theme
is this
that
once you
become
dependent
on somebody
else
you tend
to degrade
your own
capacities
to be
autonomous
once you've
got something
to rely
on that's
reliably
out there
why do
it myself
you know
it's
the lazy
gene
story
that if
there's no
selection
to maintain
it
let it
go
but if
you let
it go
you become
dependent
it's a
ratchet
it's a
one-way
street
and it's
the result
of
degradation
loss of
autonomy
loss of
autonomy
nevertheless
forces you
to be
more
complex
because
now you've
got to
rely on
something
else
and they
will
that
that will
then rely
on you
so the
multi-celled
part relies
on the
single-celled
part to
reproduce
if you think
about it
for us
I can't
reproduce
without
sperm
and eggs
is there
a subheading
to falling
up
have you
thought of
yes
the
subtitle
is
how
inverse
darwinism
catalyzes
evolution
okay
I like
just making
a note
yeah
so
obviously
I'd have
to explain
inverse
darwinism
yes
the idea
here is
as I've
described
and it's
a recognition
that we
talked about
at the
beginning
which is
that you
have to
produce
something
that life
always has
to produce
excess
in order
to stay
ahead of
the second
law of
thermodynamics
but in
producing
excess
you're
producing
duplicates
of things
but
what we've
learned from
information
theory
is that
duplicates
or redundancy
is a way
to deal
with noise
so
if you're
having
trouble
understanding
what I'm
saying
I can
repeat
it
again
or I can
give you
another
example
of it
or something
like that
or if we're
talking to each
other across
a noisy room
I have to
repeat myself
many times
or you know
wave my hands
or whatever
redundancy
we know
is a way
to deal
with noise
so that's
that's great
so noise
is happening
of course
all the time
but there's
another side
to redundancy
here
and particularly
in life
if you always
have to produce
more of things
you have to
redundantly
produce genes
maybe
then one of
the things
that happens
is that
that allows
you to also
tolerate noise
so if you
have a redundant
system
already
you can
tolerate noise
so if I've
got a system
in which
like in the
English language
there's a lot
of redundancy
in what letters
can show up
next to each
other
a lot of
redundancy
and constraint
become part
of each other
here
in the story
redundancy
is about
the same
constraint
about the
possible
variety
being
constrained
so in a
signal
that's got
redundancy
there's a lot
of constraint
not a lot
of things
can happen
it holds
less possible
information
with more
redundancy
but with
redundancy
we can
tolerate
noise
so with
living systems
if you
produce
redundant
parts
you now
have sort
of a
backup
we
learned
this
initially
all the
way
back
in
1970
and
it's
only
really
been
brought
to the
fore
in the
last
two
decades
and I
think
only
very
recently
have we
begun
to
realize
how
important
it
is
in
1970
a
Japanese
geneticist
named
Susumu
Ono
wrote a
book
called
Evolution
by
Gene
Duplication
and what
he was
talking about
was not
reproduction
but how
when you
looked in
the genome
we're just
beginning to
get a sense
to look
in the
genome
in 1970
what you
see
is that
sometimes
the same
gene
gets copied
right next
to itself
these things
called
transposons
there's
various ways
this can
happen
can grab
a chunk
of DNA
and stick
it on
next to
itself
or stick
it somewhere
else in
the system
or
retrotransposons
can take
an RNA
molecule
and
transpose
it back
into a
DNA
sequence
and stick
it somewhere
else
well it
turns out
that the
human genome
is full
of transposons
full of
duplicate
genes
they're just
copies of
each other
all over
the place
now the
question is
what's going
on under
these circumstances
well a couple
of interesting
things
is that if
you have
copies of
it
there's a couple
of things
possible
so one of
the set
of genes
that we have
lots of
copies for
are for
example
tRNA
transfer
RNA
molecules
we have
over 500
genes
that are
really good
copies
of the
20 different
tRNA
molecules
they're
dispersed
all over
the genome
the reason
for this
is we
have
in each
cell
tens of
thousands
of ribosomes
constantly
at work
producing
proteins
using
tRNA
we've got
to produce
a lot
of tRNA
so best
to have
a lot
of them
to do
it
but the
problem
with a lot
of molecules
a lot
of genes
is that
the body
is set up
so that
you've got
to have
just the
right number
just the
right
concentrations
of proteins
a good
bad
example
of this
one
is
what we
get with
trisomy
21
down
syndrome
the
smallest
one of the
smallest
except for
the y
chromosome
simplest
chromosome
simplest
autosomes
the 21st
chromosome
in trisomy
just simply
doesn't get
separated off
during meiosis
and so you
get three
of them
but that
means you
get
not twice
as much
protein
produced
but two
and a half
times as
much protein
produced
you get a
little bit
more protein
produced
but it
turns out
that having
extra amounts
of protein
produced
produces all
kinds of
problems
it's a dosage
problem
you're just
producing too
much protein
and so all
the effects
we see in
down syndrome
are the result
of this
including early
onset
alzheimer's
and things
like that
so not
everything can
work by just
producing lots
more genes
but what happens
is oftentimes
when you have
multiple genes
produced
you now have
a backup
so if
something goes
wrong with
one of the
copies
the function
is still
there
and so that
copy can
degenerate
and degenerate
and degenerate
and we have
a lot of
what we call
pseudogenes
that are the
result of this
one of my
two of my
favorite examples
one is
three color
vision in
primates
it's the
result of
the gene
that produces
the color
receptor molecule
that we call
an opsin
or rhodopsin
that we see
in the cones
of the retina
it turns out
that a gene
we have three
genes for producing
three different
opsins
one for the blue
one for the green
one for the red
and receptors
well it turns out
that most mammals
only have two
one for the blue
and one for the green
they're called
dichromats
as a result
we're trichromats
and about
somewhere around
50 or 60
million years
ago
primates
as they came
into sunlight
interestingly enough
developed a third
copy
and they did
so by
the green
opsin gene
was copied
right next to
itself
so we now
got two of them
they're redundant
of each other
so
one of the
things that
happened
is
one of the
redundant ones
began to
degrade
because
you've got
the function
you're producing
color vision
you're producing
light
perception
just let it
degrade
you've got
one already
there
how did it
degrade
well it
degrade
and then it
couldn't take
on as much
high frequency
light
became redder
and redder
and redder
in its
sensitivity
but now we
have the
possibility
of something
that is
picking up
the low end
of the
greenish
spectrum
now the
green one
doesn't have
to pick up
as much
red
it can be
more shifted
in the
bluer
direction
so now
we have
three
not quite
evenly spaced
rhodopsin
proteins
that are
produced
and luckily
each cone
gets a
different
rhodopsin
a different
gene gets
expressed in
each cone
so now we
have a cone
for red
green and
blue
and they're
sending us
information back
to the nervous
system
now getting
different information
and their
combinatorial
interactions
produce this
capacity we have
to see in
color
so here you
see gene
duplication
and degeneration
because of
redundancy
because of
error
you might
say
error
protection
the loss
of function
was not a
problem
it was
it was
tolerated
but this
tolerance
allowed it
to degrade
but degrade
into a
likely
potentially
usefully
synergistically
interacting
molecule
with the
one that
was already
there
why
because
it already
had the
function
of taking
on light
just degraded
a little bit
and now
its function
is slightly
different
but the
probability
of interacting
with the
other one
synergistically
producing
something
novel
is much
much higher
precisely
because they
came from
a common
background
well this
turns out
to be the
case all
over the
place
in the
genome
that's why
I call it
falling up
that is
the new
function
the more
complex
function
was the
result of
actually
redundancy
duplication
and degradation
but what
that degradation
did is it
produced
the opportunity
for interesting
interactions
and those
interactions
if they become
useful
now natural
selection can
maintain them
it won't
just degrade
into nothing
now it
turns out
that a
similar thing
happened with
us and
vitamin C
with us and
vitamin C
as I said
way back
I've mentioned
this before
way back
in the
mid 90s
a group
of Japanese
researchers
went to
the rat
genome
and they
looked for
a gene
that might
be associated
with a
protein
that converted
glucose
to ascorbic
acid vitamin
C
it does
so endogenously
rats don't
need to
eat fruit
in fact
very few
animals need
to eat
fruit
a few
birds do
a few
bats do
and monkeys
and apes
all do
that's because
we have
the gene
a fossil
of the gene
that produces
this last
enzyme
that produces
vitamin C
endogenously
but ours
is full
of noise
it's
accumulated
so much
damage
that it's
become a
pseudogene
it looks
like a
gene
it's got
some of
the same
features
but it's
got all
kinds of
problems
and it's
got stop
codons
in it
it's got
a frame
shift
which makes
it all
nonsense
and so on
and it's
slightly
different
in each
primate
lineage
but they've
all had
this one
degraded
it's degraded
because of
somewhere between
50 and 60
million years
ago
primates
stopped
mostly eating
insects
and started
eating fruit
and to eat
fruit
you better
look at it
and discern
you know
whether it's
edible or not
well fruit
has always
been
had its
seeds
dispersed
by birds
which always
could see
in three
colors
birds are
always
trichromates
some more
more so
in fact
than even
primates
but how
did fruit
advertise
to birds
that now
is a good
time to
eat me
well there's
a couple
things
the fruit
had to
produce
something
that birds
want
kind of
sugar
right
so sugar
is a great
thing for
an animal
that has
a high
metabolism
needs to
fly around
but having
them flying
around is a
great way
to disperse
seeds
so take
advantage
of birds
but now
the key
is my
seeds are
not going
to be
ready
and my
the food
that I've
got for
the birds
is not
going to
be ready
for a
while
it's got
to mature
a bit
how do I
advertise
to the
birds
that now
is a good
time to
eat me
and to
take my
seeds and
poop them
out somewhere
else
the answer
is
color
change
undergo
color
change
stay
green
to be
like
leaves
indistinguishable
and then
suddenly
change to
blue or
orange or
red
that contrasts
but if
you're a
dichromat
you can't
see this
now why
does this
link to
the vitamin
c story
if you
ever cut
open an
apple and
leave it
out on
the table
it turns
brown
right
that's
because the
sugar gets
oxidized
the way to
keep sugar
from becoming
oxidized is
to have
ascorbic acid
so fruiting
plants had
to dump
ascorbic acid
in with
their sugar
have lots
of ascorbic
acid
but now
as primates
begin eating
fruit
they're getting
lots of
ascorbic acid
which is
redundant
with the
ability to
produce it
themselves
and so
it masked
natural
selection
and allowed
this gene
to degrade
but now
we're addicted
to fruit
we get
scurvy if
we don't
eat it
you know
Magellan lost
half of his
crew sailing
around the
world because
of scurvy
because they
weren't eating
fruit
we're addicted
but now we
have a bunch
of other
things
I like sweet
I like sour
I can see
in three
colors
I have a
transporter
molecule in
my blood
that carries
ascorbic acid
from cell to
cell to
cell more
effectively
I have
other
antioxidant
capacities
as well
so
this changes
in a sense
now
there's this
higher order
relationship
between us
and fruit
but this
is the same
kind of
relationship
that produces
addiction
to other
things
this is the
kind of
addiction
I talked
about the
addiction
of single
celled
organisms
to their
multi-celled
life cycle
it's an
addiction
of the same
sort
you've lost
some capacity
and now
you're stuck
with this
other capacity
so I call
this inverse
Darwinism
because what's
happening is
these results
are the result
of relaxing
natural selection
of tolerating
noise
duplication
processes
make this
more likely
and make
synergies
more likely
to show up
complexity
more likely
to develop
it's a
totally different
kind of logic
it's inverse
Darwinism
not because
there's not
reproduction
not because
there's not
variation
those are all
there
duplication
is like
reproduction
variation
is degeneration
it's the second
law of
thermodynamics
it's just
that this
happens in
a context
of error
tolerance
no longer
competing
for resources
resources
are always
there
two genes
okay
they're both
there
doesn't take
a lot
of extra
work
there's not
a cost
not a
significant
cost
so it's
the inverse
of natural
selection
because
there's
no
selection
the third
part
of the
Darwinian
story
selection
competition
is irrelevant
it's not
about
cooperation
though things
may end up
cooperating
because they're
forced to
because they're
addicted to
each other
it's not
about
cooperation
it's simply
about the
relaxation
of natural
selection
there's no
selection
under the
lack of
selection
you over
produce
more
combinations
are possible
possible
synergies
can show
up
possible
interactions
and therefore
more
degradation
can take
place
and things
can become
more
codependent
more addicted
to each
other so to
speak
that's a big
part of the
evolution story
that we've
missed it all
along
from a
teleological
perspective
since that's a
big part of
the work
where do you
see this
sort of
heading toward
if you had
to propagate
moving forward
where are we
here
so first of all
I see
these two
logics
I see that
we have to
think of
these two
aspects of
the evolutionary
process
it's the
you might
say
inverse
Darwinism
is the
yin
of Darwin's
yang
selective
yang
you need
both
you need
an additive
process
a complexifying
process
and a
simplifying
subtracting
process
they both
have to
work together
in the same
sense
that the
two
self-organizing
processes
I talked
about
originally
in the
autogenic
virus
story
have to
be
counters
to each
other
they have
to
become
both
the
boundary
conditions
for each
other
and the
limiting
conditions
for each
other
you've got
to have
both
you've got
this
interaction
well this
kind of
dynamic
is what
evolution
is about
evolution
is not
just
natural
selection
it's
this
combination
and that
means
processes
that are
evolutionary
wherever we
find them
are going
to have
this logic
this two
part logic
this yin
and yang
logic
that includes
the kind
of evolutionary
process
that thinking
involves
that social
development
involves
that the
addiction
we have
to a
shared
form of
communication
language
how it
evolved
we became
addicted
to it
my book
the symbolic
species
is about
how we
became
addicted
to this
shared
distributed
thing
that we
need each
other for
language
can't be
maintained
by a single
individual
it's not
innate
in the
sense
there's not
an autonomous
language device
built into
us
it's something
that self
organizes
selectively
in a social
process
it has
its
collection
we're
addicted
to it
in the
sense
that single
cells are
addicted to
the multi-celled
organisms that
they need to
gestate in
we need to
gestate in
this social
soup that
we call a
symbolic
world
right
we're addicted
to it
and what I
would say
is our brains
don't even
work normally
if we don't
get raised
in this
environment
our brains
expect
this
this is part
of the
condition
of normal
human
development
but this
had to
evolve
by the
same
kind of
mechanism
and it
has to
work
neurologically
by the
same
kind of
mechanism
there's so
many different
aspects of
your work
that's so
fascinating
it's so
it's
I wish
we could
literally
speak for
hours
but because
of the
fact that
we started
with the
mind
we went
into life
before we
head towards
the rest
of the
questions
I want
to take
us back
into the
mind
what I
would love
to do
Terence
is in
the future
obviously
take a
specific
aspect of
your work
maybe a
paper
a specific
part of
your book
and we
can go
into great
detail about
that specific
component
because I
think it
allows us
to explore
and expand
on that
a lot
more
for now
I want
everyone to
understand
your work
in a very
general
perspective
even though
that's pretty
much impossible
but when
you wrote
Incompleteness
of Nature
when you
talk about
that factor
can you
clarify for
everyone who's
watching or
listening I'll
put a link
to the book
in the
description
it's a
wonderful book
I read it
a few years
ago and then
again recently
how does it
relate to your
broader argument
about the
mind's
emergence
very good
question
so first
of all
go back to
what we
talked about
early on
in this
process
the
hylomorphism
that strange
loop between
the
constraints
the
information
and the
substrates
that that
information is
carried by
that is
living processes
create that
kind of a
strange loop
so the
question of
consciousness
I think
has to do
with the
fact that
we are
physical
that everything
about what
brains evolved
to do
is to
maintain that
physical
relationship
but
neurologically
you can say
that our
neurological
processes
are a
strange loop
within a
strange loop
that is
our bodies
are what
I call
vegetatively
sentient
they respond
irrespective
of my
nervous system
to the
world
in a variety
of ways
and we see
this even
after a
person dies
you know
their fingernails
keep growing
their hair
keeps growing
and that
sort of
thing
because
biology
itself
has this
strange
loop
of
information
of
replication
of
repair
of
continuation
but
animals
have this
interesting
problem
animals
unlike
plants
are not
rooted to
the ground
they don't
have to
just respond
to us
immediately
around
they can
actually
change
the context
by moving
from here
to there
by following
resources
by you know
all the
things that
we do
but to
do that
you've got
to do
predictive
work
you've got
to sort
of
you've got
to represent
something
that's not
here now
and then
move
towards it
even if
it's as
simple as
you know
anticipating
what's
50 feet
in front
of you
maybe it's
just a
smell
gradient
that you're
going to
follow
you've got
to have
something
that
predicts
and so
we have
this whole
system
that does
so
I think
that the
nervous
system
has its
own
teleodynamics
so I like
to distinguish
these two
by saying
that there's
vegetative
the teleodynamics
produces
vegetative
sentience
sentience
meaning
simply
self-repair
responding
to the
world
plants
do this
bacteria
do this
there's
this sense
of
that
they're
responsive
to the
world
with respect
to their
needs
so to
speak
but in
a very
simple
direct
way
animals
have added
an extra
you might
say an
extra
cycle
upon this
that is
a self
organizing
strange
loop
teleodynamic
cycle
within the
teleodynamic
system
because it's
got to do
this prediction
stuff
but it's
got to do
prediction
with respect
to my
body
needs
so it's
doing
it's
prediction
with respect
to what
the
teleodynamics
of the rest
of my
body
is doing
whether I'm
a really
simple
animal
or a
complex
animal
and in
this
process
there's
got to
be
within
the
nervous
system
its own
teleodynamics
the key
to teleodynamics
it's about
the generation
of self
the term
self
organization
is a
misnomer
but I think
a teleodynamic
system
has self
this is why
it can
repair
itself
it can
reproduce
itself
it's not
just
pattern
it's
in a
sense
it's
its own
embodiment
well the
key is
the nervous
system
has to
be doing
this as
well
so I
have a
body
sentience
what I
call the
vegetative
sentience
of my
body
and then
there's
the
vegetative
sentience
of the
nervous
system
I think
the
nervous
system
itself
has a
kind
of
vegetative
sentience
it's a
kind
of a
closure
so that
it has
this
process
that involves
metabolism
and so
on
that's
also
physical
substrate
neurons
are trying
to stay
alive
they're
getting
perturbed
by
information
coming
from
other
nervous
systems
from
other
neurons
and
they're
just
trying
to
stay
alive
in
this
maelstrom
of signals
coming in
and causing
their
metabolism
to go
up and
down
but now
since the
one is
inside the
other
is part of
the other
is maintaining
the other
we've got a
teleodynamic
process about
a teleodynamic
process
a process
that's a
strange loop
about itself
as well
because the
body is
keeping the
nervous system
as well
so there's
a strange
loop
linking
strange loops
so to
speak
in this
respect
that's what
I think
animal
nervous
systems
provide
now
what that
means
is that
we're not
only
aware of
our body
of the
substrate
that we
are
but it's
the very
substrate
that is
linked to
the world
that is
structuring
that is the
constraint
on the
dynamics of
the brain
and the
dynamics of
the brain
of course
are moving
us around
to the
world
changing
the substrates
on our
body
so it's
what you
might call
a strange
loop
between
two
strange
loop
systems
it's
that
complex
but that's
why we
are in
the world
physically
why I
have a
self
I have a
self
precisely
because that
self is
physically
grounded
because all
the constraints
are physically
grounded
and they're
about
themselves
and they're
about the
substrate
of themselves
so I've
recently become
very much
involved in
looking at
the metabolism
of brain
function
recognizing
that I
think
that emotion
that feeling
the dry
feeling
the feeling
of need
the feeling
of something
has to happen
or the feeling
of resistance
that we feel
the feel
of being
is about
this relationship
between the
information
and the
physicality
and the
fact that
we're doing
work
that everything
that a neuron
is doing
is work
and that
work
is resisted
can be
promoted
and resisted
and I feel
that
we're thinking
now forget
the thinking
part of it
thinking feels
like something
you know
this is because
there's work
involved
and work
feels like
something
because
there's
resistance
work is
always against
something
that's resisting
and what's
it resisting
there's
constraints
and the
information
itself
is
constraints
strange
loops
about
the
relationship
between
strange
loops
this is
I think
the problem
of consciousness
and why it's
so difficult
to get to
it
once we
have
taken
taken
the
cartesian
pill
we drunk
the cartesian
kool-aid
and we think
that
that information
is somehow
this disembodied
separate stuff
we lose
the possibility
of even
doing this
if we
begin to
look for
the
neural
constraints
of consciousness
trying to
find it
somewhere
it's not
going to
be there
it's in
this
complicated
relationship
so
I have
to say
that I
think we're
still fairly
primitive in
asking the
question about
what consciousness
is for
precisely this
reason
we are
still in
the shadow
of Descartes
we haven't
really
recognized
the
Asherian
paradox
here
what a lot
of people
like to
bring up
the
aboutness
of experience
when they
talk about
qualia
or the
subjective
phenomenal
experience
of reality
and you
have two
specific
definitions
and words
that you
use in
your work
absential
and
intentional
now for
all of us
listening
this is
different
from
intentionality
which also
I'll allow
you to
define
Terence
but you've
now spoken
about what
is called
intentionality
so what
role does
absential and
intentional
properties
have when
it comes to
understanding
the framework
of mind
and life
perhaps
well again
the story
of absential
is very
straightforward
when you
think about
it
that all
representational
relationships
are
structured
by virtue
of something
that they're
not
but we
could say
the same
thing
about all
living
processes
they're
structured
by virtue
of something
that they're
not
but they're
structured in
a way that
maintains
that relationship
to something
that they're
not
and they
do so
by virtue
of the
constraints
but the
constraints
are about
what's
prevented
that's
something
that's
not
there
so
that
relationship
is the
key
to that
story
and that's
what's
going to
get us
to the
strange
loop
what I
call
the
Escherian
Paradox
the fact
that we're
hylomorphic
in a much
more complex
and interesting
way
so in
that respect
what that
says is
why is there
a feel
to things
why does
it feel
like something
what does
it feel
like to
be a
bad
that kind
of question
it's the
qualia
question
but it's
not that
qualia
are things
out there
or this
other stuff
qualia
is this
the result
of this
entanglement
of information
with physicality
it can't
be disentangled
and because
of this
there's
always
something
incomplete
about this
why
because
there's
something
absent
always
involved
the
structure
of things
present
are there
because
of what's
not
there
again
go back
to the
Taoist
statement
things are
structured
by virtue
of use
but use
is about
the future
use is
about
what's
possible
what's
potential
it's not
about
what is
alone
it's
just
that
what
is
is
now
in
some
cases
going
to
be
constrained
by
what's
possible
what's
made
possible
so
that's
that's
why
I see
these
linked
and
it's
going
it requires
us to
rethink
how brains
work
in a
fundamental
way
it requires
us to
to stop
thinking
about
brains
as doing
computation
brains
are not
doing
computation
they're doing
something
more like
life
in fact
it's
why
living
information
processes
feel like
something
machines
don't feel
this
why
because
the
information
that's
coursing
through
them
has
nothing
to do
with
their
physicality
yes
it's
physically
embodied
but it
plays
no role
in the
structure
of the
system
it
plays
no role
in what
it's
made
of
or what
will
happen
if it
begins
to
break
down
it's
got no
skin
in the
game
so to
speak
would you
would you
compare
this to
what
4e
cog
side
call
like
inactivism
would you
would this
be a
similar
concept
in that
regard
I think
it's
similar
the
problem
with
inactivism
is I
think
it's
still
I think
it's
still
Cartesian
you'll
notice
that
we
enact
things
but
to
enact
something
you gotta
do
work
if you
leave the
work story
out of it
and how
enacting
comes to
be
you know
you're still
in this
Cartesian
world
you think
it's more
of a
property
dualism
at that
point
less
completely
dualistic
but more
kind of
assuming
a property
dualism
I think
I'm not
sure I
would say
it that
way
but I
think
it's
leaning
in that
direction
what I'm
trying to
get rid
of
is
this
property
dualism
what I
want to
say
is that
Descartes
Cogito
is the
constraint
absence
side
of
Descartes
res
extensa
physical
stuff
that is
Descartes
simply
separated
the absence
and the
presence
that can't
be
separated
so it's
not
dual
properties
has to
be one
yeah
how does
your approach
address the
traditional
mind-body
problem
we started
by asking
for your
philosophical
history of
it
but what
insights
does your
work
or what
would it
offer
regarding the
relationship
between
mental and
physical
states
so first
of all
it would
make that
question
foolish
there is
no
right
there is
no
difference
they are
the same
thing
but we
got to
recognize
that they're
aspects of
the same
thing
it's not
dual
properties
it's
aspects
of the
physical
world
I always
love
I always
love asking
that question
because the
podcast is
called
mind-body
solution
because
technically
it's
nullified
there is
no
mind-body
solution
because
it's
just
a
mind
that's
right
they're
not
separate
exactly
so
but
another
way
to
think
of
this
is
I
see
this
all
the
time
particularly
in
more
philosophical
writings
about
the
brain
they
talk
about
the
mind
slash
brain
the
mind
slash
brain
is
just
a
way
to
say
I'm
not
a
dualist
but
I'm
a
dualist
I'm
really
not
a
dualist
even
though
I'm
saying
something
totally
dualistic
I
recognize
that
you
got to
have
a
mind
and
the
brain
has
to
have
a
mind
and
the
mind
has
to
have
a
brain
but
I'm
still
talking
about
them
as
though
they're
separate
stuff
have you
seen
Robert Lawrence
coons
landscape
in
fact
before
he
produced
it
I
had
him
give
a
talk
in
a
conference
I
was
running
in
which
he
laid
out
the
story
what
I
should
say
the
story
is
just
a
list
it's
just
a
list
of
ways
to
come
at
it
I
think
it's
a
great
value
but
I
think
the
value
of
it
is
that
we
can
now
say
let's
throw
away
99%
of it
tomorrow
he
told me
to
email
him
tomorrow
just
to
remind
him
we're
going
to
have
a
conversation
soon
what are
your
thoughts
on the
taxonomy
in general
I
think
it's
a
great
way
to
do
it
taxonomies
drive
me
crazy
because
they
don't
explain
anything
yes
it's
just
to
show
you
what's
out
there
twice
in
that
one
I
listed
twice
in
two
different
topics
I
think
I
saw
that
and
I
wondered
whether
it was
on
purpose
or
it
was
not
an
accident
he
told me
I'm
doing it
on purpose
look at
these
I like
it a lot
I think
it's
great
and I
think
it
needed
to
be
done
we
needed
to
have
something
like
that
where
somebody
put
it
all
together
said
this
is
the
whole
collection
it
beat
me
similar
but
slightly
different
but
he
really
got
there
before
me
right
right
so
part
of
the
issue
is
what
I
call
a
meta
analysis
of
his
meta
analysis
the
question
is
how
did
he
come
up
with
the
categories
yes
what's
the
logic
of
the
categories
I'm
going
to
make
notes
now
because
this
is
going
to
be
my
approach
okay
is
the
logic
of
the
categories
simply
created
by
the
properties
they're
out
there
in
each
of
these
categories
but
if
that's
true
it
reifies
all
their
properties
right
so
the
question
is
is
there
an
urologic
that
is
behind
this
that's
philosophical
his
is a
philosophical
one
it
breaks
up
in
terms
of
mostly
philosophical
taxonomy
categories
I
would
like
to
see
a
more
constructive
theory
that
says
okay
these
are
this
set
of
theories
are
assumed
in
that
set
of
theories
and
this
set
of
theories
are
assumed
in
this
other
set
of
theories
and
there's
a
hierarchic
relationship
in which
they're
nested
within
each
other
or
contrasted
to
each
other
by
you
know
inclusion
or
exclusion
relationships
are
there
a
set
of
principles
to
construct
this
taxonomy
because
he
did
construct
a
taxonomy
but
like
most
taxonomies
it's
you
know
it
can
sometimes
be
just
as
critics
of
this
have
described
it
in
biology
as
butterfly
collection
I
got a lot
of
different
butterflies
and I
look at
them
these
are
like
each
other
these
are
like
each
other
these
are
different
I
just
organize
them
in
front
of
me
he's
done
that
that
has
to
be
done
first
so
I
think
his
task
is
one
that
has
to
be
done
first
I
think
there
were
people
who
disagreed
with
their
placement
in
the
oh
absolutely
absolutely
and I
would say
that
the reason
I'm in
more than
one
place
is that
I'm not
in any
of those
places
yeah
and I
think
that's
true
for a
number
of these
theories
but again
overlap
in many
different
ways
and a
lot
of them
are
way
more
different
than
we
think
they
are
in
different
ways
yes
exactly
even
those
in the
same
category
yes
exactly
and so
so yeah
I think
this is the
first step
the next
step
is to
do
what you
might call
the meta
taxonomy
of the
taxonomies
how is the
taxonomy
generated
it's a
project
I'm going
to put
that's going
to be
literally
I'm going
to work
on that
good
good
I think
that's a
great
one
try my
best
but you
as a
materialist
when you
think about
your
view
you propose
that
consciousness
is
is
not
simply
an epiphenomenon
of
brain
activity
but has
a unique
causal
role
so
absolutely
because it
can be
separated
how do you
substantiate this
with the
materialist
ontology
just for those
who assume
that that's
impossible
to
conceptualize
together
because the
materialist
ontology
is not
complete
that's the
incompleteness
problem here
you've got to
recognize that the
materialist
ontology
ignores the
absential
relationships
once you
get over
that
then it's
fine
so
i don't
consider
myself
a quote
materialist
or a
physicalist
whatever those
mean
because
we've already
defined those
in ways
that exclude
the possibility
that exclude
the possibility
that
absential features
are structuring
what's there
i recently
well for the
most part
was told that
physicalism and
materialism are
different
this was by
professor john joe
mcfadden when he
spoke to me about
his electromagnetic
theory of
consciousness
when he spoke
about semi-field
theory
and it didn't
really occur to
me until that
moment when he
said like
if you think
about this
electromagnetism
waves functioning
he's very much
materialist but
not necessarily
a physicalist
because you can't
think of waves
and electromagnetism
as physical
entities
and that's when
i kind of
thought okay
these are
actually quite
different
yet similar
they are
and yet of
course as
einstein showed
us that
one is the
other
yes exactly
it's not that
they're separable
they're just
different phases
of
many people
consider them
synonyms to
just mean the
same thing
yeah yeah
and they're not
of course
but again
these are
philosophical
theories that
have specific
definitions
and you'll
notice that
they that
neither of
them have a
place for
representation
so there's
you know
representational
perspectives
mostly are
thought of
as
non-materialist
perspectives
non-physicalist
perspectives
and so
the very
taxonomy
of these
systems
has made
it impossible
to make
sense of
it
when you
think of
the broader
philosophical
implications
of your
teleodynamic
framework
particularly in
terms of
how we
understand
intentionality
and consciousness
what comes
to mind
I'm not
sure of the
question
I'm saying
so
what are
the broader
philosophical
implications
that come
out of your
work on
teleodynamics
and your
view on
consciousness
in general
and the
mind
from this
teleodynamic
perspective
does that
make any
sense
big question
you know
the metaphysical
implications
to some
extent
I actually
wrote a
paper
some years
ago
with a
colleague
called
steps to
a metaphysics
of
what's it
called
steps to
a
shoot
but basically
it's about
what are the
metaphysical
assumptions
of the
teleodynamic
approach
and one
of them
is that
we have
to embrace
paradox
that
that the
strange
loop
that I'm
talking
about
is the
most
basic
aspect
of what
existence
is about
and it's
effectively
paradoxical
because it's
necessarily
self-reflective
and self-undermining
at the same
time
this is the
Asherian
Gerdelian
kind of
problem
why my
book was
called
Incomplete
Nature
the Gerdelian
story says
that things
are
incompletable
that reality
is necessarily
incomplete
and that
means
time
incomplete
means that
what is
here now
is
incomplete
it can't
be enough
time is
necessary
the problem
with
with
the metaphysical
implications
here
and this is
the metaphysical
implications of
emergence as
well
the concept
of emergence
emergence is
about
incompleteness
it's about
it's not
enough
it can
always be
more
it can
always be
different
you can
go all the
way back
to the
Greeks
to find
out that
the concept
of change
itself
is
inconceivable
and yet
it's necessary
why is
that the
case
well
because
change
is that
what is
is not
what is
will become
what is
not
self
undermining
the present
undermines
itself
to become
the future
that's
that's
this strange
loop
paradox
but
what it
means about
time is
something
very
interesting
it seems
to me
I think
of time
as
incompletable
dimensionality
hard to
make sense
of that
but
but think
about this
way
I was
a real
fan
of
Einsteinian
theory
I still
am
Einstein
just blows
my mind
his
thinking
and yet
we deeply
disagree about
how he thinks
about time
yet time
was this
sense
the essential
idea
in his
series
and this
Lorentzian
collapsing
of space
and time
together
into
quote
space
time
this
four
dimensional
manifold
that becomes
the real
basis of
his work
especially
in general
relativity
I think
is fundamentally
wrong
and it's
wrong in
the following
sense
when somebody
initially tried
to explain
the
Einsteinian
theory
about time
he said
well you know
just thinking
about what
they call
light cones
and things
like that
he said
imagine
that the
world is
a two
dimensional
world
and that
time
is how
one
two
dimensional
plane
becomes
another
two
dimensional
plane
becomes
another
two
dimensional
plane
that time
is the
third
dimension
in which
these
spaces
these two
dimensional
spaces
come one
after the
other
after the
other
after the
other
this creates
what some
people have
called a
block
universe
that we've
got a
three
dimensional
block
made up
of
two
dimensional
universes
and time
is following
a line
through
this set
of this
block
from two
dimension
from dimension
to dimension
to dimension
I thought
about this
and then I
asked myself
the following
question
okay
I know
why we're
not everywhere
but I
don't know
why we're
not everywhere
being a
point on
one of
these
tells me
that's why
I'm not
everywhere
but the
line
why am I
not everywhere
well
this can be
answered
because the
real issue
is here
no I'm
only in
this
when
this
point
this
space
at this
time
but why
how can I
explain
how I go
from this
point to
this point
to this
point to
this point
on the
timeline
in my
block
universe
the answer
is well
I have to
have another
dimension
I have to
have time
because if
I'm if I'm
not everywhere
at this
point in
time
I have an
extra dimension
that keeps
track of
why I'm
only here
and why I'm
only here
I need that
dimension to
say now I'm
there now I'm
there now I'm
there to
not be
everywhere
I have to
have another
dimension
but I
can now
say the
same thing
with that
dimension
infinite
regress
yeah it's
an infinite
regress
I think
time is
incompletable
dimensionality
that is
we always
have to
have to
not explain
why I'm
not every
when
I need
to have
that piece
now in
that piece
I do a
complicated
construction
of what I
think time
is about
and I
think it
has to
do with
understanding
paradox
and this
strange
loop-like
relationship
but that
means that
if the
universe
is
incompletable
incompletable
not just
in time
but incompletable
in dimensionality
then emergence
is
a given
newness
is always
there
you can't
have
a world
without
newness
things emerge
things are
different than
they were
and they will
always be
different than
they were
because
it's incompletable
because even
dimensionality
even
building a
more complicated
you know
ten dimensional
space time
continuum
is not going
to do it
yes
like
novelty
is the
norm
yeah
you can't
it's
it's because
of incomplete
nature
nature
is fundamentally
incomplete
and it's
very root
based on
based on
this work
what do
you see
as the
most promising
directions
future research
or cognitive
scientists
or philosophers
of mind
can take
this
and go
with it
I'm
mostly
in an
area
I mean
I know
neuroscience
pretty well
that's my
training
I know
evolutionary
biology
and I'm
getting better
and better
at understanding
molecular
biology
and
evolutionary
theory
there's a lot
to learn
so I'm
not sure
I have a lot
to offer
in this
respect
and yet
I do
think
this will
help us
rethink
what we
call
computation
we know
how minds
work
but we
know also
that they're
about their
own embodiment
they're about
their own
physicality
we have
built
these
devices
to be
tools
that don't
have that
feature
and that's
why they're
reliable
tools
but this
does mean
that the
physicality
can be
brought back
into it
in a more
and more
complete way
I'm not
suggesting
that's a
good thing
but it
means that
we can
understand
the difference
between
computing
and thinking
this way
but we
can ultimately
probably
generate
devices
that think
and feel
and know
when you
speak
you speak
of the
mind
as a
process
and
I see
it very
much
similarly
in that
regard
it's
this
dynamic
process
rather than
a static
entity
just existing
as this
Ian Vittal
type of
phenomenon
how does
this
perspective
influence
cognitive
science
or cognitive
functions
like memory
decision making
perception
because
I mean
it's an
important way
to conceive
of this
problem
and then
thereafter
apply to
AI
well
and I
think
the two
realms
are
very
different
than where
we'll go
with the
two
realms
but
because
my
interest
in the
nervous
system
I'm
beginning
to pay
much
more
attention
about
how
metabolism
plays a
role
in thinking
and how
thinking
changes
metabolism
of the
brain
and so
a lot
of our
recent research
has been
looking at
to what
extent
changes
in blood
flow
and oxygenation
are
changing
thinking
and attention
when it's
actually
metabolism
that's the
initial
driver
and that
neural
activity
are
secondary
I think
this will
help us
understand
disturbances
of the
nervous
system
particularly
things like
schizophrenia
and depression
and so
on
why
because
these are
also
metabolic
problems
and I
think
understanding
that is
an important
issue
and to
recognize
that
when I
change
my
attention
it's
not just
that there's
sort of
a change
in information
going on
but
blood flows
changing
all over
the brain
and
to learn
how that's
controlled
I think
gives us
a hint
as to
why
there is
such a
thing
as feeling
as emotion
as the
sense
of doing
something
of being
something
of being
here
and not
being
in a
sense
in a
coma
and that
is because
the feeling
is the
resistance
that's the
dissonance
between
the information
that's being
processed
and the
metabolism
that's
necessary
to support
it
and is
being
resisted
by it
so
we
recognize
that when
I feel
something
it's because
there's
resistance
pushing
against
something
or something
is pushing
against me
and there's
a kind
of inertia
it's not
a surprise
that we
think of
the term
about
feeling
as we
use the
term
emotion
it's got
inertia
attached to
it
when I've
got a
strong
emotion
it's got
a kind
of inertia
to it
I can't
stop it
and in part
that's because
there's
metabolism
behind it
there's
work being
done
work requires
oxygen
and glucose
we've got
to spend
a lot more
time
understanding
the nervous
system
at that
level
and understanding
this
entanglement
between the
metabolism
and what
neurons are
doing
but to
flip this
around
to the
computer
world
one of the
things that
we know
about
I was
talking to
people
about
supercomputers
many years
ago
and the
one I was
interested in
is one
they were
explaining
it's in
this big
refrigerated
room
it's got
these big
massive
refrigeration
systems
to keep
it cool
because
the
thousands
and thousands
of CPUs
it's using
because it's
so distributed
they heat up
as they
run their
flops
and their
transistors
are turning
over
they're generating
heat
the process
of computing
is a
thermodynamic
process
they need
to cool
it because
you know
if they get
hot
and as they
get hot
they get
noisy
they don't
they don't
do so
well
you lose
signal
I said
well that's
interesting
you've got
these huge
refrigerators
running
using lots
of energy
and you've
got these
huge computing
systems
using lots
of energy
and generating
heat
could you
just put
a thermistor
on each
of the CPUs
and take
that information
about heat
about the
work it's
doing
and sending
it back
to a central
processor
and say
this is part
of the signal
part of the
work of
computing
is heat
and this
is information
about the
work you're
doing
and therefore
could you
use this
to sort
of redistribute
the work
to say
make that
one a little
quieter
and turn
this one
up a little
bit
instead of
just thinking
of the
heat
as waste
the heat
is actually
information
it's about
the physiology
of computing
now it's a
trivial part
of this
strange loop
but it's a
part of
recognizing
the non-cartesian
nature of this
process
that it's a
physical process
and it's got
physical correlates
and those
physical correlates
also can be
constraints
and can be
used to do
work
and can be
used to
produce new
constraints
that are
new
computing
features
now to
my knowledge
I don't know
if anybody's
ever used
this logic
but it's
the kind
of logic
that this
would suggest
once you
recognize
the
hylomorphic
nature
of all
of this
that's an
obvious next
step
it is
are you
familiar
with the
work done
by Mark
Psalms
Terrence
a little
bit
he and
I
communicated
back in
the 90s
in my
symbolic
species
days when
he was in
New York
and I'm
not
and we
have not
been
I don't
I haven't
followed his
work since
then and
I'm not
sure that
he's followed
my work
what you're
talking about
right now
at this
point
towards the
end of
this
conversation
is very
similar to
the work
he does
he focuses
on homeostasis
and affect
being a very
important part
of feeling
being a
fundamental
feature of
consciousness
and reality
and the way
we perceive
the world
so the focus
is fundamentally
on that
homeostatic
evolutionary
on almost
the ancient
part of
the way we
got to where
we are
it's less
cortical
he's less
concerned about
this cortical
fallacy
is what he
calls it
but rather
this has been
happening for
a longer
period over
time
and
I agree
with that
yeah
we've merely
put the
cortex now
and that's
because we
think reason
and intelligence
is the biggest
fundamental
aspect of
consciousness
all right
brains have been
around long
before cortex
but here's the
interesting thing
that if we're
talking about it
in information
terms alone
I don't think
there's any such
thing as feeling
there
I think
it's always
about work
and resistance
and I love
the way
you've managed
to make
that physical
in terms
of a
legitimate
equation
at that
point
it's like
when you
bring in
maths and
physics
into this
it's a lot
harder to
just dismiss
it
yeah
exactly
love it
when you
were
when I
remember
reading your
work
it's years
ago
and then
often read
throughout the
years
when you were
growing up
who were the
people you
looked up to
you mentioned
a few people
already in your
journey
Noam Chomsky
Foda
a lot of people
who've been
part of this
well not
this
mostly the
the absential
the negative
part the part
that I've
worked against
but no
I would say
that
there are a
bunch of
early ones
one of the
early effects
was reading
Arthur Kessler's
book The
Act of
Creation
he wrote
it in
64
Kessler
was a
novelist
and an
essayist
became
very much
interested
in
anti-reductionism
later in
his life
but his
book
Act of
Creation
was something
he started
in the
late 40s
and I guess
took him
like 10
12 years
15 years
to write
because
sort of
like my
problem
you think
about one
thing and it
leads to
something else
and leads to
something else
and leads to
he wrote
it initially
because he
wanted to
explain
why
jokes
discovery
and art
are like
each other
these are
all involved
in the
act of
creation
and the
experience
this sort
of
the
haha
experience
with
jokes
the
aha
experience
with
discovery
and the
aha
experience
with art
and he
said
you know
where do
they come
from
and he
came up
with this
idea
of what
he called
bisociation
it's
this juxtaposition
of opposites
and incompatibilities
in a way
that resolves
in three
possible ways
and he
then went
on to say
but that
tells us
something about
the cognitive
process
of the
creative
process
and he
then begins
to look
at how
various
artists
and scientists
and humorists
create
and then he
begins thinking
about what
does that mean
about thought
processes
and how
is that
related to
biology
and is this
a little bit
like the
regrowth of
limbs on
salamanders
that have
lost their
limbs
and it's
all about
these creative
processes
these generative
processes
so I
read this
as a
young teenager
and I
went
this is
so wild
interestingly
enough this
book was
required
reading at
Harvard
in the
late
60s
I don't
know that
anybody
remembers
it
but it
got me
going in
this
direction
what got
me going
after this
is coming
in contact
with a
man named
Gregory
Bateson
and Gregory
Bateson
I first
of all
read his
stuff
reading about
complex
systems
theory
what's
that
his dad
not
William
Bateson
yes
his dad
is William
Bateson
the geneticist
Gregory
Bateson
was once
the husband
to Margaret
Mead
the anthropologist
he and
Margaret
split up
but they
both
attended
this series
of conferences
called the
Macy
conferences
in the
40s and
50s
this is
Josiah
Macy
and whose
I guess
it was his
son put
this together
was to
talk about
what was
what was
then called
teleonomy
information
theory
and complex
systems
theory
in the
beginning
of
computation
stuff
that was
beginning
in the
late
40s
and early
50s
and they
were trying
to put
it together
with theories
of culture
of mind
of biology
and that
sort of
thing
really a
productive
group
so you
can find
the
information
about the
Macy's
conferences
online
but it's
it's
where
I would
say
systems
theory
thinking
got into
all these
other
domains
so
Margaret Mead
and Gregory
Bates
and Gregory
was initially
an anthropologist
himself
but then
became much
more interested
in information
theory
and stuff
and
I came
in contact
with him
initially
by picking
up his
book
Steps
to an
Ecology
of Mind
his idea
that
mental
processes
were like
ecological
processes
that we
had to
think
about
biology
and ecology
and economy
and mentality
with the
same
tools
and it
was just
a collection
of his
essays
but they
were so
mind-blowing
that I
became
immediately
interested
and I
eventually
found a
guy
who was
one of
his
students
a fellow
who was
at the
time
in British
Columbia
and wrote
a book
called
System
and Structure
based upon
Bateson's
ideas
and in
the early
70s
taking in
structuralism
and Marxism
and economic
theory
and trying
to figure
out if
they all
fit together
his name
was Anthony
Wildem
and Wildem
then introduced
me to Bateson
eventually
and I
became
a total
acolyte
in this
area
but then
and this
is what's
weird
this has
to do
with
one of
these
strange
moments
in history
that happens
to many
of us
as a
college
student
I was
poor
supporting
myself
couldn't
buy
books
and
so
to read
the latest
things that
are out
there
I couldn't
find them
in the
library
because of
course
they were
just
published
so what I
have to do
is I have to
go and sit
in the
bookstore
take a book
off the shelf
and read it
while I'm
sitting there
in the
bookstore
so this
became
my study
area
and I
remember
going to
the bookstore
and I was
reading
books about
the other
person who was
really influential
at the time
was W. Ross
Ashby
and his
introduction to
cybernetics
and his
design of a
brain
and that
kind of
stuff
taking
cybernetic
theory
and trying
to make
it sensible
link it up
with information
theory
and so on
all this
stuff
and complex
systems
theory
and starting
to read
the beginnings
of genetics
that were
developing
in the
70s
and so on
all this
was exciting
so I was
sitting in the
bookstore
reading these
things
and the
guy was
stacking books
in the
bookstore
who I think
was sort of
on the
spectrum
not a very
good communicator
but really
apparently
really knew
what he was
doing
I would
find him
suddenly he
would be
behind me
looking over
my shoulder
and he
would say
oh you're
reading that
you should
read
purse
and I
went
what do
you mean
purse
and he
said
well
purse
is a
philosopher
and I
said
well at
the time
I don't
read
philosophy
you know
I'm into
science here
none of that
stuff
and so I
would go on
with my
reading
and I'd pick
up another
book
and again
and again
you know
week after
week
there'd be a
time he'd
show up
and he said
no you're
reading this
one now
but you know
you should
look at
purse
he's almost
like a
google ad
yeah
yeah exactly
stop bothering
me
you're a
weird guy
you couldn't
possibly know
what's going
on
and finally
I picked up
a book
that was
by a
neuroscientist
Warren McCulloch
called
Embodiments of
Mind
and as I was
reading through
it I came
into the
later chapter
and it was
all about
purse
I went
oh my
god
and so
he comes
around me
again
and I
said okay
I get it
give me
something to
read about
purse
and so he
picked it
he went over
to the
philosophy
section
he pulls
out this
book
he said
here's a
collection
of some
of
purse's
work
take a
look at
this
I started
to read
it
and I
went
oh my
god
this is
all the
stuff that
all these
guys thought
they were
talking about
and that
they were
ignoring
and that
this guy
75 years
ago
was writing
about
and it
seemed
through
these
problems
and I
went
oh
yeah
I learned
purse
so I
dropped
out
I was
in college
I dropped
out
and I
took
all the
money
I had
and I
bought
the only
set
of books
of all
of
purse's
writings
it's
collected
volumes
produced
by Harvard
University
Press
and I
spent
I don't
know if
it was
a full
year
but a
long
time
just
sort of
struggling
through
it
it was
a mess
it was
terrible
this guy
is a
horrible
writer
and
brilliant
and
a
despicable
guy
nobody
liked
him
and so
most of
his work
was never
published
interestingly
enough
I've never
read purse
personally
I'm looking
forward to
checking this
out afterwards
so
here's
what I
did
after this
I went
back to
school
and I
wrote a
senior
thesis
on
purse's
philosophy
particularly
his
semiotic
theory
and its
relationship
to
cybernetic
theory
it's called
semiotic
it's called
cybernetics
and semiotics
the relevance
of CS
purse
I'm gonna
start
I'll send
it to
you
because
although I
disagree with
many of
some of
purse's
thinking
particularly
his
metaphysical
thinking
I find it
troublesome
in some
respects
but the
semiotic
theory just
blew me
away
and
so
I as
a young
now just
recently
graduated
I did my
senior work
I graduated
I got
out of
there
I applied
to Harvard
and I
sent this
off
and I
said
I want
to work
with somebody
that knows
purse's
work
and this
philosopher
named
Israel
Scheffler
said
okay
come into
my program
and so
here I am
this nobody
from the
northwest
a small
little college
out of the
way
goes to
Harvard
drives
across
country
with my
newborn
daughter
and my
wife
in an
old VW
band
weird
story
and what
I was
going to
Harvard
to do
was to
study
with somebody
about this
and I
had just
learned
that all
of
purse's
unpublished
work
was in
a library
at Harvard
called the
Houghton
Library
in just
manuscript
copies of
handwritten
material
I thought
wow
this is
where I
want to
be
I got
there
studying
with this
guy
spending
time with
the other
philosophers
that were
there
brilliant
people
there was
Willard
Van
Roman
Quine
the
logician
who I
studied
with
briefly
there was
Hilary
Putnam
who I
studied
with
briefly
took a
seminar
from
these
guys
never
worked
out
and it
didn't
work out
in the
field
it's
amazing
but that's
the power
of being
in a place
like that
you get
to rub
elbows
with these
guys
that blow
your socks
off
one of
Quine's
quotes
I remember
was
studying
the human
mind
without
studying
abnormal
mental
phenomena
is
basically
scratching
the surface
of nothing
you're
literally
looking into
nowhere
that's
right
it's
an
n of
one
yeah
yeah
of course
but anyway
the long
and short
of this
is that
I was
unable
to get
to
purses
unpublished
papers
I was
a nobody
I can't
put my
hands
on this
valuable
stuff
so I
gave up
and I
shifted
were the
people
who were
allowed
to
actually
touch
it
so
eventually
yes
now
and a lot
of stuff
has moved
to Indiana
where they've
been trying
to put it
together
the other
problem
with the
early
purse
work
that I
read
is it
was
organized
topically
not
historically
not in
terms of
how he
was thinking
in time
not his
so
stuff that
he was
thinking
early in
his life
is next
to stuff
that he
was thinking
at the
end
of his
life
and
he had
to sort
read
the notes
at the
bottom
to find
out when
it
was
and so
I had
to also
reconstruct
how he
reconstructed
his thinking
with this
luckily
there was
one
author
that tried
to come
up with
the history
of Peirce's
thoughts
at the
time
that helped
me a little
bit
but I was
unable to
do that
and so
I jumped
ship
philosophy
is not
where I'm
going to
go
I'm going
to do
evolution
and evolution
of the
brain
so I'm
going to
take courses
in neuroscience
I'm going
to take
courses in
evolutionary
biology
and
this is
when I
also
left
taking
courses
from
people
like
Chomsky
and
Fodor
this is
just
philosophy
I'm going
to leave
that behind
but the
Persean
influence
has been
with me
ever since
and then
when you
enter the
new realm
of evolutionary
biology
who became
your new
heroes
and icons
in the
field
I was
very very
lucky
at the
time
so
at the
time
at Harvard
this is
when the
big
arguments
around
sociobiology
were brewing
so I
got to
work
briefly
with
Steve
Gould
with
Dick
Lewenton
with
Edward
Wilson
with
and for
a year
Bill
Hamilton
came to
give a
set of
talks
I had
this
great
class
with
a lecture
class
with
William
Hamilton
and
Robert
Trivers
I don't
know if
you know
who
Trivers
is
Trivers
as far
as I
could tell
never gave
a lecture
unstoned
and
I'll
see if
I can
describe
this
scene
here
we
are
in
this
big
lecture
hall
and
there's
a
stage
and
all
these
black
boards
over
the
back
of
the
stage
Bill
Hamilton
comes up
and he
says
a few
words
turns to
the
black
board
and
starts
writing
equations
talking
and
that's
the
rest
of
the
hour
lecture
Bob
Trivers
comes
up
in
the
next
lecture
sits
down
on
the
front
of
the
stage
with
his
legs
hanging
over
with
his
sandals
and
starts
free
associating
about
evolutionary
theory
and
about
Hamilton's
theory
of
kin
selection
and
so
on
and
what
it
means
and
so
on
totally
weird
juxtaposition
but
incredible
at the
same
time
I'm
starting
to
make
friends
with
Steve
Gould
and
Dick
Lewenton
who
hate
this
stuff
Steve
Gould
definitely
hated
those
I
remember
him
and
yet
Steve
Gould
was
himself
brilliant
yes
wonderful
Dick
Lewenton
brilliant
and so
here you've
got
brilliant
ideas
warring
with
each
other
people
that
don't
like
each
other
and
you
know
and yet
they're
all doing
great
stuff
so
I
was
in
the
camp
with
the
evolutionary
biologists
so
Gould
was
sort
of
not
in
my
camp
but
I
had
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about
and
I
got
a lot
from
him
and
I
would
say
that
I
you
know
after
he
passed
rediscovered
a whole
lot
of
stuff
that
I
now
realized
was
there
that
I
hadn't
paid
attention
to
but
he
was
sort
of
the
outs
among
the
Harvard
biologists
they
didn't
like
him
because
he
didn't
get
grants
he
didn't
do
lab
research
he
didn't
do
field
research
he
was
just
writing
these
popularized
things
and
his
students
even
got
support
mostly
from
his
popularization
so
you
know
it
wasn't
and
yet
he
had
this
incredible
mind
this
incredible
sort
of
crossover
from
the
philosophical
the
historical
put all
this stuff
together
in just
a wonderful
way
and so
I
gained
a lot
from
that
but
so
I
was
in
the
middle
of
this
it was
a great
place
to
be
because
I
got
to
listen
to
all
these
people
talking
to
me
like
trying
to
convince
me
about
why
I
should
not
think
that
it
was
a
terrific
place
to
be
and
of
course
they
went
through
that
rise
and
fall
of
behaviorism
at the
same
time
oh
exactly
so
behaviorism
was
just
collapsing
this
is
the
end
of
the
70s
beginning
of
the
80s
behaviorism
was
on
its
way
out
and
so
I
also
got
to
study
with
developmental
psychologists
in fact
one
of
my
I
would
say
the
closest
confidant
was
a
guy
named
the
historical
development
of
developmental
psychology
and
sort
of
recognizing
how
we
were
changing
our
thinking
about
how
minds
developed
at the
same
time
Piagetian
psychology
was
all the
rage
at
Harvard
and
so
I
took
classes
from
Piagetian
psychologists
and
from
linguists
who
were
interested
in
child
development
of
language
so
it
was
a
great
time
to
be
in
the
middle
of
all
of
this
so
and
that's
why
I
did
my
research
tracing
connections
in
monkey
brains
because
I
thought
well
now
you
could
do
something
empirical
to
sort
of
pursue
this
I
became
very
disappointed
in
the
developmental
psychologists
in
part
because
they
were
treating
the
brain
of
a
child
as
the
brain
of
an
adult
that
just
didn't
have
enough
input
yet
and
so
now
Piagetian
says
well
you develop
these
ideas
and these
ideas
follow
then
these
ideas
follow
these
stages
follow
one
after
the
other
and
that's
because
of
you know
the
ideas
the
knowledge
that's
being
accumulated
by
assimilation
and
accommodation
and so
on
but in
fact
children's
brains
are very
different
than
adult
brains
and
two
two
two
two
year
old
brains
are
radically
different
and so
as I
began
studying
brain
evolution
I
realized
you know
evolution
doesn't go
from adult
brain
to adult
brain
to adult
brain
it goes
from adult
brain
to a
child
brain
to
maturing
differentiating
to an
adult
brain
to produce
another
child
brain
to
differentiate
and
the
brains
of
youngsters
are
very
different
and the
developmental
process
constrains how
evolution
can actually
work
what can
actually
evolve
so in
my
PhD
work
which
eventually
contributed
years and
years later
to the
symbolic
species
was recognizing
that you
can't
understand
evolution
unless you
understand
development
you can't
understand
how
brains
evolve
unless you
understand
how brains
develop
because the
developmental
process
will determine
and constrain
how the
evolutionary
process
can take
place
the
evo-devo
perspective
you know
I was thinking
evo-devo
at a time
when you know
the term
wasn't there
but it
was a
necessary
part
there was
a bunch
of us
all over
the world
of course
being hit
by this
evo-devo
problem
that was
that Steve
Gould
had already
talked about
that Steve
Gould
was already
aware of
as a
problem
but just
historically
you know
going back
to heckle
and going
back to
his problems
of
neoteny
and so
on
which I
think were
dead ends
ultimately
but nevertheless
he recognized
that this
was a
problem
so that's
what I'm
saying
it was a
terrific
time to
be there
I got
this
off
it's almost
like this
Mount Rushmore
era of
philosophy
and science
coming together
would that
gives you
this unique
perspective
and I think
like a nice
closing question
would be
what's your
thoughts on
this relationship
between philosophy
and science
at this point
how do you
see these
two fields
coming together
or moving
away from
each other
which they're
both doing
sadly
so there's
a lot of
good philosophy
of science
out there
and one of
things that's
happening in
the field
is a lot
of philosophers
young philosophers
are going
to study
with scientists
going to
hang out
in labs
and trying
to figure
out how
it's done
I'm not
sure that's
the way
it should
go
the real
problem
with science
as I see
it
the technical
sciences
is that we
know
we often
know so
little of
the philosophy
and as a
result
we
how should I
say we
reinvent the
wheel again
and again
and again
and again
ideas or
thought
100 years
ago
come back
again and
again
because we
haven't
realized
that no
you can
think yourself
outside of
that box
if you're
careful
so I think
the sciences
lack that
and philosophy
of course
gets to be
too preoccupied
with itself
and not
looking
so that
I have not
really a
sense
that the two
will come
together
I think
they're separate
planes
they'll run
separately
but there
will be
interaction
I mean
I'm somebody
who I would
say that
I can't
not be in
both realms
in my
thinking
and
and that's
probably because
of my
background
but probably
because
I flirt
between all
these areas
I think
deep down
you still
love the
philosophy
even though
you are
more of a
scientist
I would say
and I think
people have
often times
they look at
people like
me and say
oh he's
a scientist
that's gone
into
philosophies
you know
he's no
longer
you can't
trust him
because he's
just thinking
philosophical
things
a lot
of us
you know
who have
a scientific
background
that begin
to sort
of ask
the questions
that we
never asked
when we
were younger
I thought
of you know
okay they're
getting older
doddering
forget what
they're
thinking
I think
that's a
mistake
but I
realize I'm
probably in
that ballpark
as well
now I agree
with you
I mean that
even happens
to me
as a doctor
when I talk
about philosophical
even if I
speak about
idealist
theories of
consciousness
with other
guests
when I go
back to
work
I have
friends
who just
think I'm
completely
out of my
mind
just because
of
it's got
nothing to
do with
medicine
so they
just think
I'm
crazy
which is
pretty cool
to see
how
the other
thing that
happens
and this
happened
in my
career
that most
people who
fetal
neurotransplantation
work
or my
developmental
brain
research
or my
comparative
brain
anatomy
work
don't know
that I
think
any of
these
philosophical
thoughts
people that
have read
incomplete
nature
have no
idea
that I
actually
spent
decades
doing
laboratory
research
with
neurons
fetal
neurons
and
measuring
the structure
of that
structure
in the
brain
or
doing
tracer
work
nobody
knows
about
that
work
and
then
in the
90s
I was
doing
all this
work
in
transplantation
and part
of it
was medical
of course
a lot
of it
was about
hunting
disease
and Parkinson's
disease
and maybe
we could
use cell
transplantation
methods
to deal
with these
diseases
so people
know of my
work in
that realm
and then
they wonder
why I left
it
why am I
not still
doing this
stuff
that's the
problem
if you've
got too
many lives
people don't
know that
you've had
all these
lives
but all
of these
lives have
influenced
my thinking
in each
of these
realms
yeah
thanks
Terrence
thank you
so much
this was
an absolutely
wonderful
conversation
you've been
such an
amazing guest
I really
appreciate
your time
all right
well we'll get
back to it
at some point
I will
definitely
and I look
forward to
our round
too
I can't
wait for
it
thanks so
much
I'll send
you a couple
of papers
to your
appetite for
the next
cycle
I can't
wait
I'm excited
okay
as soon
as possible
cheers
Terrence
all right
