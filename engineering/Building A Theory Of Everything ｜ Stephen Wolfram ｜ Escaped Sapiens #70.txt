we think we understand the very low-level machine code of the universe but getting to stuff that we
recognize and even that has been analyzed in existing mathematical physics that's a big long
you know effort where do the fundamental laws of nature come from that's what this conversation is
about i speak with mathematician computer scientist and theoretical physicist stephen
wolfram about his attempt to derive the laws of nature starting with almost nothing now these
ideas are outside of mainstream physics and they're not fully fleshed out but the claim is
that some real progress has been made so that's what this discussion is about it's an overview of
some of the main ideas for a candidate theory of everything i'm shane farnsworth and this is the

so let's start with a few definitions that will pop up again and again in the conversation
what is computational irreducibility and why should people care about it right actually it turns out
it is almost exactly 40 years old as of later today the very first time i wrote the words computational
irreducibility happened 40 years ago later today so to speak so what is it so when we think about how
we figure out how a system behaves we we can say we may know the rules by which the system operates
for example we may know some rules for some program we know the rules by which it operates the question
is how do we find out what the system will do so let's say we want to know what will happen after a
million steps of running these rules well one possibility is that we can just work out a formula
and say okay we know after a million steps we just fill in the number a million into some formula we get the
answer immediately that's kind of the the concept that has been typical in kind of mathematical
approaches to science that it's kind of like you can solve it and get a formula for what will happen
what computational irreducibility is about is the fact that in many systems you can't actually jump
ahead and see what's going to happen the only way you can work out what's going to happen is to follow
each step and just see see what will will happen so why is that important the essentially the if you
look at kind of the the the big arc of sort of history of science the um the sort of the the thing
that really launched a lot of modern science was the idea of introducing mathematics into into science
and sort of the concept there was we'll just work out a formula for what's going to happen we'll use
calculus or something we'll say this is you know this is the formula at a time t we can work out the
result and that's been kind of a dominant theme in sort of the exact sciences for the last 300 years
and it's led people to believe that oh you know if you're doing epidemiology you've got these formulas
and you can just work out what will happen kind of the assumption is with mathematical science we can
always jump ahead and see what the answer will be computational irreducibility kind of denies that
computational irreducibility tells one there are systems where there is no way to kind of jump ahead
and just say what the answer will be it's something where to know what the system will do you essentially
have to follow every step just as the system itself behaves and so that that's a that's a pretty
important idea it turns out because it kind of gives one from within science it kind of shows one a
fundamental limitation of science it also has some very positive aspects for example you know we lead
our lives we you know we progress through time and so on if the if we could always say oh we know what's
going to happen in the end in the end the answer is going to be 42 or something there will be nothing
achieved by that by the leading of our lives and the passage of time but what computational irreducibility
tells us is that actually there is something irreducible that's achieved by the passage of time
by kind of the progression of of of things that happen through the course of of time in our lives
and so on so it's kind of a a um on the one hand it tells you that the bad news is it tells you you
can't always know what will happen the good news is it tells you there's something that that that you
can't always know what will happen and that there's sort of a thing achieved by actually progressing
through that time now you know there are many many places where computational irreducibility shows up
like for example if you're interested in ai and you're interested in can we set it up so that ai's
will only do what we want them to do well if you have computational irreducibility you'll never succeed
in doing that because there will always be a way that the ai as it actually progresses and does what
it does will surprise you and so i think one of the things that for example will be a big kind of societal
debate is to what extent do we allow computational irreducibility for ai type systems if we say
no they've always got to be predictable well fine then they'll only do what we want them to do but
they won't be able to do a lot of the powerful things that they would computationally be able to
do so it's kind of like do you want computational irreducibility or do you want to sort of fit everything
into this reducible box where you can know what's going to happen so you know you might ask i mean
that there are computational irreducibility has many consequences and you know at some level it has
very banal kinds of consequences like saying you know why are there bugs in programs well because
most you know it is hard to foresee what programs will do that's a that's a kind of computational
irreducibility symptom a thing when i was inventing computational irreducibility uh you know i thought i
thought of it as kind of a limitation on science but for example one of the things i absolutely never
imagined is the idea of proof of work in blockchain for example which is essentially a computational
irreducibility idea and um it's uh you know and that because that's a thing where one is one is taking
irreducible effort and one is kind of to you know do bitcoin mining or whatever else and that's so
there's again there's something is being done and that's something is sort of this irreducible
computation something i certainly didn't imagine when i when i came up with computational irreducibility
another another aspect of it is i mean it just has many many consequences but another one that i've
studied uh quite a bit is trying to understand things like the second law of thermodynamics
the fact that when you start systems off in a kind of orderly way like gas molecules
sort of arranged in an orderly fashion they tend to become more disordered over time and the question
is why why does that happen and what's happening is that they are effectively the the collisions of
these gas molecules are implementing an irreducible computation and that means that when we look at it
because we are bounded in the sort of computational work that we can do in perceiving what's going on
we can't decode kind of this irreducible computation that happened and so we just say oh it looks random
to us and that's kind of the essence of the second law is that there's this mismatch between the
irreducible computation that's happening in these actual molecules computing where they're going to go
and the bounded computation that we are able to do as observers of that system and it turns out this
this interplay between the computational irreducibility of underlying systems and our computational
boundedness as observers of those systems that seems to be the key thing that basically leads us to the laws
of physics that we have this is something i absolutely did not see coming and it's i think it's a very
remarkable thing that the the sort of the three key theories of 20th century physics statistical
mechanics second law of thermodynamics is one of them general activity the theory of gravity and space
time another one and quantum mechanics the third one it turns out to my great surprise i think all three of
those theories are derivable not just things that happen to be the way they are but they are derivable
from sort of the underlying computational uh character of the universe effectively of of
it's sort of an inevitable computational structure combined with the fact that there is computational
irreducibility interacting with essentially our boundedness and other characteristics of us as observers
so in other words for observers like us it becomes inevitable that we must perceive the laws of physics
that we that we know so to speak and that that that the fact that that works is one of the important
components of that is computational irreducibility computational irreducibility is what leads us to
believe in things like the law the gas laws to not have to say we're going to look at every individual
molecule we have to know what every individual molecule does we are only able to look at this
kind of aggregated view of a gas and we're only able to do that because what's underneath is
computationally irreducible and the same thing seems to be true for space-time that the fact that we
believe in the continuity of space for example is a consequence of the fact that sort of underneath
there's computational irreducibility and because we are computationally bounded we can't kind of get
to see all those details and we just have to summarize things by saying there's there's continuous
space and it's the same type of story with quantum mechanics we can talk about talk about in more
detail but so so that's that's kind of the the key idea of computational irreducibility is that even
though you may know the rules by which a system operates that may not tell you what will the system
will do you may have to just explicitly follow those rules in a sense you have to do the same amount
of computational work that the system itself has to do to figure out what it will do and so the
way that sort of what's why is why why is there computational irreducibility well the answer i think
is you can see it as a consequence of this thing i call the principle of computational equivalence
and what the principle of computational equivalence says if you look at all these different possible
systems then above some very low threshold all these different possible systems will be equivalent
in the sophistication of computations that they can do so in other words we can imagine a
microprocessor in a computer we can imagine a human brain we can imagine a bunch of molecules bouncing
around we can imagine some simple computational system some little program that you can you can
specify with black and white squares or something like this any one of those things will be able to do
the same level of sophistication of computation and that's closely related to the fact the idea of
universal computation it's also closely related to things like goethe's theorem um it's a uh but it's a
it's a slightly tighter version of those kinds of things okay so if one has this principle of
computational equivalence what does it mean well what does it what what does predicting a system consist of
the system is doing what it does it's computing what it's going to do and you as the predictor of
the system are going to be smarter than the system the system is doing what it does it goes through a
million steps or something you're somehow going to be able to do some smarter thing and conclude in
five steps this is what the system is going to do well the principle of computational equivalence says that
that isn't going to work because it says that whatever means you have to do the prediction whether it's
your brain or mathematics or a computer or whatever else it is computationally equivalent to that little
system that you're looking at and so you can't expect to kind of jump ahead and predict what it's
going to do you basically are stuck having to follow every step and and just do the same computation
that it does so it's kind of a the the the reason why computational irreducibility happens is because
there is this one sort of uniform level of computational ability that exists and at least in in things like
our universe so to speak and and that's uh sort of embodied in this principle of computational equivalence
so that that's that's uh it's uh you know i i have to say in the in the 40 years since i originally
kind of came up with i i actually the idea of computational irreducibility was a few years older than that
but the term computational irreducibility is almost exactly 40 years ago um today um but um you know
it's been it's been interesting the extent to which sort of that way of thinking about things has
affected uh kind of has has found its way into all these different domains and all these different
issues and i mean they're you know they're just there's so many of these things like for example
another one is is to ask the question kind of um things like will there be will there be an end
to science will there be an end to mathematics uh will there be will it come to be the case that
sort of uh ais can do everything and there's sort of no place for the humans type thing these are all
questions that are deeply informed by this idea of computational irreducibility
and if you don't if you don't know about that you kind of might conclude for example that uh you
know you'll you'll finish science and you'll be able to answer every question so to speak
and another one that's come up very recently is the question of you know with with ais can you just
solve all of science you just find an ai that's you know a million times smarter than us humans and
some definition of smartness and it'll just say to any science question you might ask it to say i know the
answer um and computational irreducibility basically tells you that that won't happen
um there's a small footnote to that was quite interesting which is it won't happen if you
imagine considering sort of all possible science questions if you restrict that to science questions
humans care about it's a slightly different there could be a different answer but um in the so yeah i
i mean the the i think this this notion of i mean i i in a sense as i was mentioning one can see
computational irreducibility as kind of the one of the key pieces of sort of a a different paradigm
for thinking about the world and about science than we've had for the last few hundred years i mean
in in before uh it's kind of this question of how much can we understand about the world
and you know if you've gone back 500 years many people were like well there's a lot of things
we'll never understand about the world it just happened to be that way and then there was no
we've got all these mathematical ideas we're going to crush it we're going to understand everything and
by understand what tended to be meant was we'll be able to predict everything about what will happen
and that got sort of enshrined in various people's ideas of what science fundamentally is
about prediction and so on it's not applicable to all areas of science but an area like physics for
example that's a that's a typical kind of if you know what you're talking about then you will be able
to predict what will happen in the world so to speak and computational irreducibility is kind of
i think sort of the next step in that in that journey because it tells one yes there are things
you can predict there are slices of reducibility they're actually an infinite collection of slices
of reducibility but there's also kind of a a kind of a background of things that you cannot predict
and and that's sort of the the you know so that that that gives one a different view of what science
is about what science is capable of doing and it has well both an intellectual implication and also at
some level a kind of a societal implication because in a sense there's you know there's a
there's a kind of people have often believed oh you know if we could solve society we could make
the world a better place so to speak what computational irreducibility tells you is you'll
never be able to quote solve society the concept of a kind of a a controlled system it just is never
going to work because when you think you have this controlled system something because there's
computational irreducibility there will be an infinite collection of surprises and you'll never
be able to get this kind of closed we know whatever how everything is going to work kind of system
so one of the main points that you bring up with the you brought up is that the laws of nature that
we develop they really depend on who the observer is right and so how do you how do you know what is
fundamental so you mentioned for example um in your writings you mentioned that even the three-dimensional
space that we live in might be emergent and there's some underlying computational structure that
from which it develops right so how do you know what is fundamental if if if everyone is if we're just
observers right all we have is the perspective that we have how do you how do you know that
space for instance is not fundamental if that's the thing that we really see
well it's a reasonable question i mean it's kind of the it's it's kind of what is the ultimate
abstraction what is the you know what is the thing that is you know is there an ultimate abstraction
and i think the answer is that you know i i think we can computation at some level the following of
rules is the closest i think i can come to giving you kind of an ultimate notion of abstraction that if
you say if if you if you imagine that things follow definite rules we're not saying what those rules are
we're just saying things follow definite rules at some level things follow definite rules now actually
it's it's more complicated than that because what i actually believe now is that things follow all
possible definite rules it's not like you can hold one up and say this is the rule for the universe
instead in this concept that i call the rule ad it's this kind of object that essentially runs all
possible rules and what your the rule ad consists of kind of the entangled limit of the running of all
possible computational rules so in a sense there's there is still you know in even defining that i'm
kind of using as a basis for what i'm talking about concepts like rules and computation and there
might very well be a different way to formulate the same object using a completely different way of
kind of presenting it but the thing that you know the thing that i have believe is kind of the
ultimate fundamental thing is this rule ad object which i i at least think of as this entangled limit
of all possible computations and the you know by the way just to make it even more complicated
that's the rule ad there's also one can imagine the hyper rule ad one can imagine a thing which in our
view of computation we could say let's figure out what's going to happen after an infinite number
of steps of this computation okay we can't determine that in any finite number of steps but we can
imagine as actually alan turing did at one point we can imagine that we have an oracle which just
tells us the answer and we add that on to our computer so what we end up then with is a sort of
hyper computation in addition to the the standard computation that we do where we follow every step in the rules
we're also saying and we're adding on this black box that will just tell us the answer to what
happens after an infinite number of steps and so we can go in addition to the rule ad which is this
thing that's the entangled limit of all possible computations we can imagine a whole hierarchy of
hyper rule ads that that embody the the entangled limits of these hyper computations and so you say
well well why you know why do we get the rule ad and not one of these hyper rule ads it turns out
that for example it's just a matter of kind of science and computation theory and so on that there's
sort of an event horizon between our rule ad and any hyper rule ad so there was no there's no connection
there can be no causation that goes from the rule ad into the hyper rule ad or vice versa and in fact
it's probably the case although this isn't something we've completely figured out that there is a kind
of rule real relativity that as an observer in any level of hyper rule ad it will look the same to you
in other words what what's tricky is you have this rule ad which is supposed to represent sort of
everything that's possible and everything that in some sense happens but we as observers are embedded
inside the rule ad and so it's this it's this elaborate question of how does an observer within
the rule ad perceive the rule ad and the answer is it depends what that observer is like
if we didn't say anything about what that observer is like we wouldn't be able to make any statements
because the rule ad contains all possible computations and we just say we don't know what's
you know everything is happening but the fact is that because we are observers of the kind we are
that that forces us to perceive certain things about the rule ad so simple example of this we talked
about the second law of thermodynamics the fact that we are observers who are computationally bounded
means that we don't get to follow every individual gas molecule and we believe in the second law of
thermodynamics we believe that what tends to happen is that we will get this computationally irreducible
process which we can't decode and it'll look random to us if we were a different kind of observer if we
were an observer who traced every molecule who was very small and had lots of computational ability
we wouldn't particularly believe in the second law of thermodynamics it would be something which
somebody would tell us oh you know if you looked at all these molecules in the aggregate this is
what you'd see and we'd say well okay we you know that's not something we notice i mean by the way
it's it's it's really kind of notable how much of the way that we perceive the world depends on our
means of perception so for example space which we think of as a very you know it's obvious space
exists we might say and it's obvious that as we look around us that we see kind of a slice of
at a particular we see a region of space at a particular time and then you know time passes and we see
a region of space at a different time but that depends a lot on a bunch of scales so for example if
we look around you know if you're in a room you might see 10 meters away well it takes light you
know microsecond to get to our eyes from that distance away and it takes us milliseconds to
process what we've seen so for us in the in the environment that we're looking at it's as if we see
instantaneously we see this lump of space and then we see that changing over time we kind of see this
every movie frame we see a complete movie frame and then we see it progressing through time but if
we thought a million times faster than we do you know digital electronics runs a million times faster
than our brains do um if we thought a million times faster we wouldn't have that perception because
light travel time from the distances we're looking at would be significant and we would be seeing
you know this cascade of photons arriving and if somebody tells us oh by the way you can think of
that as slices of of of space progressing through time we'd be like oh that's kind of interesting
but it's not the way that we perceive things so you know there is a a great this it's it's not
surprising that the way we perceive the the kinds of things that we talk about and the kinds of laws
that we ascribe to the universe depend on kind of the way in which we're perceiving things and what uh you know
what seems to be the case is that for the three sort of key laws of physics that uh that we kind of
learned in the 20th century that two attributes of us as observers seem to be critical one is that we
are computationally bounded that we can't decode all that computational irreducibility and the other
one is that we believe we are persistent in time so in other words even though at every moment we're made of
different atoms of space in our models we still believe that it's the same us and we have the
single thread of experience going through time and it turns out those two characteristics allow one to
derive in precise form these three core kind of laws of physics that arose in the 20th century
which is really surprising yeah can i ask you about that when you're building your models
models how do you introduce those assumptions so how how do you introduce so you start with
the rouliad in some way um which is the space of all computations or yes and so then you somehow
introduce this notion that there's an observer that's completely bound that's not completely
bounded that is bounded in some sense and then from that assumption plus some other assumptions you can
derive for instance that space is three-dimensional or that no we cannot we don't know how to derive that
we can derive that space satisfies uh general relativity satisfies the einstein equations including
lorenzian signature yeah yeah yeah yes you get the signature as well absolutely because in our models
so one thing not uncommon in the history of science you kind of have to go back before you go forward the
fact that people concluded in 1919 that uh that no actually earlier than that it was 1909 maybe that
space and time could be bundled together i mean that wasn't an original idea of einstein's that wasn't
in the 1905 kind of special arts of a day package that was a subsequent kind of mathematical
gloss on that introduced by minkowski actually um that kind of you could think of space and time
as sort of both facets of the same kind of thing in our models they're absolutely not facets of the
same kind of thing space and time are completely different space is associated with well time i
already described time is kind of this this progression of computation the passage of time
is the doing of computation so what's space well i mean that's a slightly longer story so so the
beginning of that story kind of starts in antiquity when everybody was arguing about you know
is the world discrete or continuous and you know were there atoms was there just a flow
how was the world made of what was the world made of and wasn't known for a long time finally by the
end of the 19th century it became clear that matter is discrete there are molecules and atoms and so on
and then pretty close to that time it became clear one could think of light as being discrete as well
made of photons or whatever at that time in the early 20th century as i've come to really understand
this history better in the last couple of years most people believed that space was discrete most
people thought that just as matter was discrete so space would turn out to be discrete but nobody could
make the mathematics work out in fact um you know people like einstein made statements like you know
in the end it will turn out space is discrete but we don't currently have the tools to see how to make
this work well 100 years later we finally do and that's sort of a an underlying idea in these kind of
computational models that that that we built and so the idea is what is the universe made of well one
view of what the universe is made of probably not the only possible way to think about it but one that
i found convenient is you just imagine there are these atoms of space just these elements that are
discrete points just a big collection of discrete points they're not in space they they're what
makes space how do they make space well these points have relations to other points it's as if
they have a giant friend network of the atoms of space and you can represent that friend network as
a graph a network actually formally it's convenient to have it be a hypergraph where instead of just
saying that that to that there are a pairs of things that are related by being connected by an
edge that you can have any number of things related by a hyper edge but so so what one imagines is what
is the universe made of the universe is just a giant hypergraph and every feature of the universe is a
feature of that hypergraph so it's kind of like if you were looking at i don't know fluid like water
and you say and you and you see an eddy going through the water that eddy is just made of those
molecules of the water it is a a feature of kind of the the collective motion of those molecules that
there is this thing that we identify as an eddy and so similarly our belief is that for example particles
like electrons quarks whatever else they are things like eddies but in this hypergraph we actually
know how that works for black holes we kind of know how black holes can can exist in this hypergraph
and we can and the the thing to say is so there's this hypergraph and it has features that correspond
to we think particles we don't know how that works yet we kind of know how black holes work there
and then what happens to this hypergraph well this hypergraph is constantly being rewritten so there
are these rules that are applied to the hypergraph and the rules basically say if you have a little tiny
piece of hypergraph that looks like this it will be rewritten to one that looks like this and the
passage of time is the application of all these little rules and so that um and so then the question
is well if you have all these little rules being applied what is the kind of aggregate effect of that
could i ask just quickly is the idea that the the the smallest units here all obey the same rule or is it
that different universes correspond to different rules okay this is complicated okay so in the in
the in the sort of the first way of thinking about this everything obeys the same rule by the time you
get to the rule we add and that's another conceptual step one is dealing with all possible rules but
let's let's say there is a way of describing our universe in which every update is by the same rule
or by the same small collection of rules um it's um so so the question is if in the case of a fluid
again you've got these molecules bouncing around and they obey certain laws of mechanics and so on
and you can ask the question what will be the large-scale behavior of the fluid at the small scale you've
just got a bunch of billiard balls bouncing around but what does that mean when you have a trillion of
those or a trillion trillion of those what is the aggregate effect well the mathematics has never
been precisely filled in and in fact some things i've done recently fill in a bit more of it but
what we know is that the limit the large-scale limit of molecular dynamics of molecules just bouncing
around is fluid dynamics the large-scale limit is the this sort of continuous fluid that obeys certain
fluid equations and so on well you can ask for the same kind of derivation of the continuum limit
for this hypergraph that's being rewritten and the first thing that i i kind of knew in the 1990s
that um uh the first sort of big fact is the continuum limit of all that rewriting with certain
footnotes and so on added in which we can talk about but essentially the continuum limit of all that
rewriting is not the equations of fluid mechanics but einstein's equations for the structure of space-time
so that's a it's a really quite remarkable fact that from this kind of underlying microscopic
kind of very simple structure the the limit of that is is is the equations that we know
govern space-time now there are many many issues that come up so for example you say well the universe
seems three-dimensional to us but this hypergraph has no notion of dimension all it has is a bunch of
points and you know there's the question how do we figure out even what effective dimension the thing
has and the answer that is it's a pretty simple kind of mathematical construction you say you've
got this big graph and you've got a particular point in the graph a particular node of the in the
graph you can say well that node is connected to some number of other nodes a distance one you just
follow one edge to get to those other nodes then you then you do it again and you follow two two edges and
so on and if you say if you go r steps from that given node you ask the question of how many nodes
do you get to after you went r steps and so if you if you just think about a grid for example a
two-dimensional grid then as you go out you know r steps you'll get some kind of diamond shape
of where you got to and the number of nodes that you get to goes up like r squared just the the area
of the of the of that diamond shape so and in three dimensions it will be r cubed and so on and so what
you realize is that the effective dimension of this hypergraph is the growth rate is that is that
exponent of the growth rate of the number of nodes that you get in a ball effectively of a given radius
so that's an example of how you deduce from this hypergraph if you've got a big hypergraph you can
generate one in a computer um you get a big hypergraph you can deduce the effective dimension of
that hypergraph now that that and then you go on and uh actually if you look at that growth rate of
that that volume of that ball um there's a correction term the correction term is proportional to the
curvature of the effective space the rishi scalar curvature um and that happens to be the thing that
shows up in the einstein equations interestingly enough and so that's sort of the beginning of how things
how things develop now actually the thing i said it's a bit more complicated than that because
you're dealing with kind of growth rates not of balls and purely in space but of cones in space time
and so it's just a little bit more ornate but the idea is the same and that's kind of how you start to
derive the equations of general relativity the einstein equations from this underlying structure but it
doesn't tell you it it it simply tells you that well you if you assume that things are finite
dimensional not infinite dimensional that's one of the footnote assumptions that you have to make
to derive the einstein equations um but one of the things that is a very interesting consequence of all of
this is because dimension is now a dynamical parameter you can have dimension change in the universe
so we think that the universe is three-dimensional but actually we're pretty sure in our models that
the universe started infinite dimensional and just gradually became something that was about
three-dimensional and so one of the things that's of great interest is to try and find dimension
fluctuations and if we're lucky they will have survived to the time of the cosmic microwave background
and we'll actually be able to see the effect of dimension fluctuations in cosmological measurements and so
on and so that that's an example of um but but you know not so in our models there's this the the idea
that space uh sort of is three-dimensional is an emergent phenomenon and i think that it gets a little bit
more we don't know how to derive the number three um the three dimensions of space and and and in fact my
guess is maybe i you you asked is it one definite rule okay so i have to explain that a little bit
more so the next thing to realize is that when you're updating this hypergraph there are many
different places where updates can occur and there isn't a single kind of thread of time where you say
oh this is the next state of the hypergraph this is going to be the next state of the hypergraph
because there are all these different places where updates could occur and that that fact is what
leads to kind of the the way that relativity works that fact also leads to quantum mechanics
because the essence of quantum mechanics is that that it isn't the case that definite things happen
you know in classical mechanics you throw something it goes in a definite trajectory in quantum mechanics
kind of the idea is there are many parts that are followed and we just get to be aware of certain
probabilities in the aggregate of these parts well in these models there's it's very explicit that
there are different parts of history because there are different ways in which this updating can occur
so and and sort of then there's a whole story of quantum mechanics about how we as observers who are
ourselves branching to many parts of history observe a universe which is its which is also branching
through many parts of history but setting that aside for a second so kind of the concept is that there are
many different places where a particular rule could be applied many different orders in which the rule
could be applied but then when we get to this whole rule ad object we're not looking at a particular rule
being applied in many different places and ways we're looking at all possible rules being applied
in all possible places and ways and so there's and then there's the question of what you know from
out of this rule ad how does uh you know what what slice of the rule ad are we perceiving
as observers like us so to speak and any observer who is computationally bounded and believes they're
persistent in time will observe with some footnotes the einstein equations for space time but we don't
know how many dimensions that'll be in so my guess is that there is another aspect of us as observers
that's probably something unbelievably obvious to us um that we effectively implicitly assume that leads
us to have our perception of this rule ad object be the one that corresponds to a three-dimensional space
so you know there are many aspects of of the way that we perceive the universe that seem totally obvious to
us but actually are not so obvious here's an example one example is we can do any experiment we choose
we are not constrained we we have free will to do experiments that's not at all obvious it could be the case
that the reason we see what we see is because we are forced to do just this experiment then this one
then this one and we're not free to make a choice about what experiments we do that's an example of another
assumption that we make about how we exist in the universe so to speak another one is that we
believe in objects we believe that there are things that have some unchanging character to them so for
example we believe in pure motion we believe you can pick up a thing and move it and it's still the same
thing which is not obvious and and for example even in traditional general relativity if you're close to a
space-time singularity things don't stay as things they get sort of arbitrarily ripped apart but the
fact that we believe in pure motion we believe that there are objects is another one of these implicit
assumptions about the world that has consequences for the laws of physics that we perceive from this
rouliad from the slice that we're taking of this rouliad object i don't know you know it's one of my
my current things to think about is kind of what what are those implicit assumptions that we're making
that end up feeding into our perception of the world so to speak and and what things are as i say
given even very coarse knowledge about our assumptions we can already derive quite precise facts
about the kinds of laws that we will perceive but you know it's a question of what what other things are
we assuming that lead to other aspects of of what we perceive in the universe so one thing that i'm
rather curious about here in terms of your setup is so in in a in a geometry in a geometric space
the points are coherent in the sense that i can derive what the distance between various points will
be if i know enough information about other points in the system let's say like if i know two angles
of a triangle i can work out the other angle and so on yep um in your initial setup is there
initially a coherence that you put in or the coherence is derivable through this computational
development yeah it has to be derived i mean one of my projects right now is what we're calling
infra geometry can we build a version of geometry that doesn't start from an assumption of the existence
of space so all of these things that you're talking about like angles angles are a pretty non-trivial
thing in our in our setup uh points we know what they are lines are shortest paths in this graph gd6
in this in this graph we kind of know what lines are if we say are two lines parallel we can we can
actually give a definition of that which is this kind of operational definition that's based on
distances from every point on one of these lines to every point on the other line and so on it's a
just a little ladder type thing you can you can make you can start so that the goal is can you
build up you know this is this is our goal is to build up differential geometry basically from a new
basis because usually in you know in in kind of when you when you think about manifolds for example
kind of the idea is when you look with a powerful enough microscope you see euclidean space you see
standard standard geometrical space but in our models that isn't true what you see when us in a
in a you know in a good enough microscope you'll just see a hypergraph down there which doesn't
have any reason to look like you could in space and so the question is what does what what is how
does how do you build up geometry from that and and this question of of sort of how how yeah this
question of how why is space coherent why is there sort of why is there a space there at all that's an
interesting question and it has i think deep sort of roots so in our models the hypergraph
is effectively knitted together by events that occur so actually when i say there is this hypergraph
and it is the universe that's kind of a that's kind of a simplification because what what we really
think of there being as we can we can think about there being sort of a substrate of this hypergraph
but the reality of things is mostly the update events that occur in this hypergraph can i just
stop you for a second and for people who don't know what a hypergraph is is this do you view the
picture of this uh these steps of computation and the different directions that computation can go in
is that what you mean by the hypergraph right the the series of steps what do you mean exactly okay so so
okay it a graph is something we have a bunch of points they might be people for example and you
have relations between those points so those relations are lines that join those points so for
example you have might have a friend network and the friend network might be uh uh might be would just
be something which is just this graph it's not laid out in physical space it's just a graph
a network of relations between these points that correspond to people so the only the the hyper
part of this whole thing is only that instead of there being a relation between two entities there can
be a relation between any number of entities so for example you can have a a three-way friendness
so to speak rather than just a as a friend of b it's like a b and c are all friends together
and that's a single hyper edge that the it's not that important that this is a i mean it is
technically very important because the kind of the the it's a much more flexible structure that allows
all kinds of things that otherwise have to be distinguished to not have to be distinguished it's
technically important but conceptually it's not that important that we're talking about a hypergraph
rather than a an ordinary graph just so so essentially what one's thinking about is that
everything about the universe is determined by the relations between the atoms of space that the
only thing we can say about an atom of space is that it is unique this atom of space is distinct from
that atom of space and the only and then we're saying that we are defining relations between these atoms
of space which we can draw as this graph and we can potentially lay that graph out if we were making
a picture of it on a computer screen for example we lay that graph out in a certain way and that that
corresponds to you know that that's that's how we get sort of a perceivable thing from this underlying
kind of thing that is just a bunch of relations between atoms of space so and and so
what um uh what i was saying is that that one can think about this this hypergraph as it is
progressively being updated and every update takes a certain number of hyper edges and kind of grinds
them up and produces another set of hyper edges and that that there's an event that occurs which is that
updating event and in the end the only thing that we can perceive is the causal network of connection
between those events so what i mean by that is some event happens and the output of that event
becomes the input to another event and so that defines a kind of time-like sequence
of one event has to occur before another event in time so that because it is producing the input that
will be used in that other event and so what you end up with is this is this giant kind of causal graph
that is you can think about it as coming from the the updating of the hypergraph it is a a graph of
all the causal relations between every event that happened in the universe so for example when you get
to a black hole there is an event horizon which means there is no causal connection between what's
happening inside the black hole and what happens outside there are no causal edges that cross the event
horizon in that direction and that's that's kind of the the defining feature of a black hole in in in
our models but so this causal graph in a sense is more real than the hypergraph it is the thing that
we are really capable of perceiving to get the hypergraph what we do is we take this big causal graph
and we have to define what counts as a particular moment of time for this causal graph and there are
all these events happening and they happen all over or you know all over this causal graph what we have
to do is say this is a set of events that we will say are simultaneous in time and this is a setup very
similar to the the way that special relativity is set up um it's you are defining a simultaneity surface
of the events that you say are happening at a particular time then another set of events happen
at a later time and we can know that that there's a certain ordering a partial ordering of these events
where some events have to be after other events and so on in some events we don't know what their relative
ordering is they're space-like separated in the language of relativity and so so we build up these
space-like slices of this is what could be the current moment of time this could be the structure
of space at the current moment of time that thing that we get from slicing this causal graph is the
hypergraph so we can we can think of it that the real thing is this causal graph and the hypergraph is the
is a thing derived by saying we choose to say that this is what counts as now across all those
different events so the way to think about it in terms of the structure how where space emerges from
is the fact that space is coherent is a consequence of all of these events occurring in other words if
you if you stop the events from occurring you would you could for example you can you can you can
break off a piece of space if there are no events that knit together two pieces of space those pieces
of space are not causally connected they are effectively independent so in effect in in you know
in our perception of the universe and of space the vast majority of everything that's happening in the
universe is the knitting together of the structure of space so probably we don't we don't know but in
some vague estimates of parameter values there's really only one parameter in our models but
which is the the size of the elementary length the size of the elementary time um they're all
related um but with some very vague estimates of these things maybe one part in 10 to the 120 of
the activity of the universe is real is not just the knitting together with the structure of space
so most of the activity of the universe is knitting together space making space coherent making it be the
case that there is a causal connection for example between one part of space and another part of
space making effectively space in some sense come to equilibrium just like the molecules in a gas will
come to equilibrium and have a certain uniformity to them the fact that space has an apparent uniformity
is a consequence of the fact that there's a sort of causal connections between different parts of space
it's effectively sort of this knitting together process in space is what leads to things like the apparent
homogeneity of space and so this this phenomenon so it is an incredibly non-trivial thing that space is
coherent in other words that that there is a um and that um uh and and that breaks down for example when
you have an event horizon you no longer have causal connections between well in the case of a black hole
event horizon between what's going on inside the black hole and what happens outside i mean there are
different kinds of event horizons where you can have sort of a separation going in both directions
and so on do you resolve the singularity at the center of a black hole in your framework there is
no singularity it's just that's sort of what i mean so yeah it's discrete space and so so that means that
for example in traditional general relativity one of the mysteries is there has to be essentially
topology change in space time because a black hole with a quote singularity ends up being space time
with a hole punched in it and how do you get from space time without a hole punched in it to space time
with a hole punched in it well that's not something you can discuss in the context of standard general
activity in our models it's that's easy to get because everything is discrete and so there is no
discontinuity between kind of the thing with with you know with the the formation of an event horizon
for example and the formation of a singularity is something that is it just you can you can get there
because you're not trying to take a continuous space and change its topology you've got a a graph
you can think about a topology of a graph if you want to but the the effective you know the the
emergent continuum topology can in the limit can change discontinuously because you're taking the
limit of an infinite sized graph but when you look at the in at the graph itself you just see well it
tangled itself up in a particular way so yes it resolves that issue um as well as others i mean it's
you know in the simplest kind of black hole in our models time just stops i mean that that you see
that in general relativity as well that you know every every path every geodesic is a is a finite
length in a in a non-rotating black hole for example and so in our models the way you see that is there
are these update rules and at the center of a black hole it will just turn out there's no update you can
apply so time stops i mean it's it's it's very interesting how a lot of things that one thought
about as mathematical become in a sense mechanical so for example time dilation standard phenomenon
relatively that things that are moving quickly uh effectively have time running slower for them
in our models that becomes a very mechanical fact because if you have a thing like a particle for
example that is sort of uh that is at a particular place in space and it is kind of progressing through
time it's being rewritten its structure is being rewritten but it's staying having the same overall
characteristics but it's using the it's sort of computation budget is used to rewrite itself through
time if the thing is also moving it has to do two kinds of computation it has to it has to recreate
itself at a different place in space and it has to update its internal structure in time and so when
it's using its computation budget to move in space it doesn't have as much computation budget left over
to change with time and so effectively time goes slower for it i mean that that all turns into a bunch
of mathematics but that's the intuition behind how time dilation works in our models and and there
are other things like how gravity works for example is another very lovely thing well actually before
before we go into gravity can i just stop you for a second because i'm curious about something else
which is when you're doing this update is the fact that you're looking at all possible
updates is that what gets you around having for example a hidden model uh hidden variable model
the fact that you're yeah i mean the structure of these models is so different from the traditional
setup of few particle quantum mechanics that it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that kind of
gets you around kind of you know violation of bells inequality issues and things like this
but the end result is yes you get around those things but it's it's i mean but you must be able
to show that right you must be able to prove that so so when you follow that proof what what what what's
what are the characteristics of that proof what does it look like well okay so i would say that the
the um this is still it's still kind of complicated and it's not i would say we haven't got the cleanest
version of this we haven't got as clean a version of this as i would like to have okay i can give you
some intuition and i can tell you some mathematics but the intuition would be great yeah yeah they
don't quite meet in the middle okay so so um so essentially one one question is you might say
is our model a deterministic model and the answer is yes the whole what we call multi-way graph
of all possible parts of history there's just one of it but the question of what we experience
is a question of sort of where we are in that multi-way graph so to explain that in physical
space we experience the universe in a particular way because we are at a particular place in the
physical universe oh we think it's the same laws of physics in another galaxy but we're not actually
seeing what happens in another galaxy well turns out there's an analog of physical space that is
the thing that's relevant for quantum mechanics we call it branchial space here's how it works so we
talked about how kind of you get these multiple threads of history you're rewriting these hypergraphs
you get these different possible rewriting paths so what can happen is there's one form of hypergraph
and there are two possible rewritings that can happen so you get to get two different hypergraphs
it could turn out that those two different hypergraphs the rewritings two different rewritings of
those end up converging to a single hypergraph offer in the next step so you end up with this kind of
branching merging set of paths of history so that you think about that whole structure that's branching and
merging successively over time now you say let me take a slice of that at a particular moment in time
what you'll end up with is all these different branches of history they're sort of poking through
that slice all the kind of loose ends of this thing that was branching and merging with different parts
of history so you can then ask the question how are the different parts of history knitted together
and it's actually the same story as with causal connections in space-time but played out in a
different situation where if you say two different branches of history are next to each other if
they came from a single common ancestor one step before so you've got these branchial connections
so to speak these connections between branches and you can kind of make a map of all these connections
between branches and what that does is it builds up essentially a space that we call branchial space
and if you ask what is that what is the structure of that branchial space we wish we knew more about
that it's some kind of hilbert space thing but we don't completely know how that limit works but so
qualitatively what happens is there is you you are kind of moving to different parts of different
parts in history as you move through branchial space you're moving to different parts of history
different different possible parts of history now where it gets tricky is
is we as observers of the universe also exist in branchial space we're extended objects actually
in branchial space our minds do not experience a single thread of history our minds experience
a clump of threads of history just as we're not used to experiencing individual atoms of space
we experience these big lumps of atoms of space that correspond to what we can perceive at the scale that
we're at and so it's the same thing in in this branchial space that we are sort of experiencing
this kind of lump of branchial space and so then the the there are a bunch of different issues one is
that it is a non-trivial fact that we believe that there is a single thread of history that we experience
because because actually what what's happening is that we are conflating all the branches in this lump of
branchial space we're conflating them all to say there is a definite thread of things that happen
and that's so when and that's for example imagine that we have a quantum computer
that is what a quantum computer is doing is it's following multiple threads of history
but then what has to happen at the end of doing that quantum part of the computation is you have to
knit together all those threads of history to uh to get an answer that we humans will say yes that's the
answer it's no good to say oh well the answer is the superposition of all these different threads
of history it's that we want to know did the computer say one or zero and so we have to knit
those threads of history together and that's what in the standard formalism of quantum mechanics people
talk about as a measurement process but nobody says what happens what the mechanism for that is
they just say and then measurement happens and we get a definite answer and so in our models we get to
say something about sort of the mechanism by which we knit together those different threads of history
and it's not not obvious you know the amount of effort that it takes to knit together those threads of
history might actually be quite large so but but now you can ask questions like okay so so one key
question is in this branchial space what is the interpretation of kind of motion in branchial space
what is what what changes as you move around branchial space and what seems to be true is that motion
in branchial space is like a change of quantum phase so you know a key feature of quantum
mechanics and the usual formalism is that you describe things in terms of complex numbers
and that you describe quantum amplitudes in terms of complex numbers that's not actually necessary
there's an alternative formalism of quantum mechanics where you describe everything in terms
of positive and negative probabilities and so on but in the simplest way of doing it in the usual way
that it's treated in quantum mechanics you have these complex numbers and they have a magnitude and a phase
well what seems to be the case is that the position in branchial space is related to quantum phase
and the reason that's important is oh we didn't really talk much about gravity but in physical space
gravity is all about the deflection of shortest paths and when there's no gravity a shortest path is kind
of a straight line when there is gravity when there is a a mass somewhere a lump of mass that that deforms
shortest paths to not be straight lines that's what leads to gravity and general relativity and so on
in our models what happens is the the presence of energy okay so what what is energy in our models turns
out to be something much simpler than i ever thought it would be energy is basically the density of activity in
this network so if you look at how many events are happening per unit region of this hypergraph
that basically is giving you the energy density and that in that region of the hypergraph
it's a little bit more complicated than that in the in the mathematics but that's the the intuition is
the activity in the network corresponds to density of energy in the network and so what is being said
then is that the presence of activity deflects the parts of of of shortest paths deflects
shortest paths to no longer be straight lines and that's what leads to gravity in physical space
and so it turns out the same thing happens in branchial space that the presence of energy momentum
ends up deflecting paths in branchial space and that deflection of paths corresponds to a change of quantum phase
and there's this lovely thing the Feynman path integral which tells you that the way quantum amplitudes
work out is according to something which is a change of phase as you have a density of well lagrangian
density essentially an energy density and so what what turns out to be the case is that our models
what in physical space is gravity and the einstein equations and and uh and kind of the deflection of
things by by gravity in branchial space that same thing turns out to be the Feynman path integral
so in other words you've got in both cases the presence of activity in the network presence of energy
um deflects paths in one case that deflection of paths is a physical deflection of paths where we can just see
the thing is turning going into orbit whatever else in the other case that deflection of paths
is a change of quantum phase so when when we're talking about things like um
it's you know it's it's frustrating because i i think we're really close to having a very clean
few sentence version of here's how bells inequality works but we're not quite there yet and so i'm kind of
circling around kind of uh explaining pieces of this and it's um it's sort of frustrating because
because in the end what we're looking at in quantum mechanics is sort of how does a branching mind
perceive a branching universe and the the question of whether and one of the things is you know okay so
there's supposed to be probabilities in quantum mechanics where do those where do those different
possibilities come from in our models and the answer i think is it's really simple they just
come from the fact that we can be at different places in branch hill space
so we the fact that we observe this happening rather than that happening is because we are at this
place in branch hill space now that has little to do with so the whole sort of entanglement
and uh you know we have these multiple states and they're related and they're related in a way that doesn't
correspond to what happens in physical space and so on that's all rather trivial in our models because
there's this whole notion of branch hill space it's easy to have these these uh
sort of pieces of reality different threads of reality coexisting and so on that's a straightforward
thing how that relates to for example oh i don't know some experiment that you might do
uh that involves some interference pattern or something like this um that's another interesting
thing so again i can give you some intuition the mathematics is only partially done for this case
but you know one of the mystery mysterious things is you've got two slits and you use your you know you
say which slit did the photon go through if we um what seems what we observe happening is that we have
destructive interference for example where even though you know on its own the photon could have
gone through one slit or the other somehow we end up getting destructive interference and it's as if it
went through neither slit and how does that happen well in our models what probably happens is that the
photons corresponding to the going through the different slits wind up at different ends of branch hill
space they end up far away in branch hill space those two possibilities it went through one
slit it went through the other slit end up being far separated in branch hill space so what well if we
are an observer who has a limited extent in branch hill space then what will happen as far as we're
concerned is because these photons wind up at these different possibilities wind up at different ends of
branch hill space we'll never be able to to have a coherent view of that we'll never be able to say
yes we know what happened and so it's it's if we could if we're we're only sensitive to this small
part of branch hill space so as far as we're concerned the photons just disappeared because
there's no there's no place we can be in branch of space where we'd see both of them given that we're
of limited extent so in a sense destructive interference which is a very bizarre phenomenon in some ways
is a consequence in that picture of the fact that we have a limited extent in branch hill space
and so this the photons didn't disappear they're they're alive and well but they're sufficiently the
the the possibilities are sufficiently far separated in branch hill space that we can never perceive them
so that's that's kind of another another sort of indication of what happens but you know it's a
little frustrating because at a mathematical level we can very beautifully reproduce quantum
circuits and things using our formalism in fact it's actually now probably the most efficient way
anybody knows to optimize quantum circuits is to turn them into these multi-way systems do a bunch of
theorem proving technology at the level of multi-way systems and turn them back into quantum circuits
so we kind of know that the formalism you know reproduces at least quantum circuits
quantum circuits are not all of quantum field theory but we have pretty good reason to believe
that that will get sort of all of quantum field theory but you know when you ask about some uh you
know each of these different things that are typically identified in in quantum mechanics and you say
how does that how in detail does that work we don't quite know yet i mean in fact this is a literally
last few weeks um somebody i'm working with has been very actively working on trying to untangle
this um and we seem to be making progress so in another a little while we may have a nice crisp
this is exactly how it works um it's it's it's you know one of the things about these about this whole
activity is you know we think we understand the very low level machine code of the universe
but getting to stuff that we recognize and even that has been analyzed in existing mathematical
physics that's a big long you know effort and you know it is exciting that a lot of things people
have studied in mathematical physics seem to plug in as limits of our models so you know people have
studied you know some particular mathematical structure and yes you can find that structure
as a limit of our models our models are in a sense very flexible and but nevertheless have definite
structure um but you know various limits of them seem to seem to connect with these other kinds of
things but it's it's a it's just um uh it's hard work um kind of connecting all these things together
and um uh when when typically it's very satisfying because when you actually see one of these connections
it's like oh wow that's how that works you know i didn't i didn't understand that works in fact i
just had that earlier today about some things to do with machine learning which one can think about
using some of the methods from uh from our physics project and i just i finally understood something
that i've wondered about for like decades um about uh about why machine learning works um and uh so
that's it's it's it's very satisfying but it's hard work can i ask you you mentioned so i understand
because i understand sort of how gravity might emerge in your models right because you start off
with the assumption that you have some distances between these sort of uh smallest units within the
computational model but you mentioned about photons right so how does a photon appear in your model
do you do you have charge is also something you input it isn't we don't know we don't know how
photons show up i mean so so what we do know is how black holes work um and we can simulate you know
black hole mergers and things like that and we get nice little ring downs of of merged black holes
and so on and get little gravitational waves coming out that stuff we can we can look at and we can see
it obeys you know it's it follows what the einstein equations seem to say actually it turns out to be
a really good numerical model for doing general relativity so it's actually something which people have
started using as a kind of build up from the microscopic structure rather than build down
from the continuum equations but um in terms of what a photon is and how it works we don't know
i mean in fact my increasing guess is that particles are very much like black holes and one of the things
that's been kind of a uh uh you know our expectation slightly more technically is that particles are
certain kinds of topological defects in this uh in this hypergraph so it's as if you know you have a
it's like you have these sort of topologically stable things like an eddy in a fluid for example
once you have that fluid going around and you know having that the other spots in the middle which
which is you know in which things are going around different directions on different sides of that spot
it's it's hard to untangle that eddy and so it has a certain stability through through time
and our our our guess is that that's how particles work but we haven't figured out the details of of
what you know what are those topological defects i mean just to give you a sense of why this is hard
okay a few years ago i was talking to sort of one of the world's sort of leading graph theorists okay
and i'm asking about you know how do we understand how these topological defects work in graphs and so
on because there's some sort of elementary versions of this that are understood for planar graphs and
such like he looks thinks about it for a minute he says come back in a hundred years we may know a
little bit more by then so in other words it's you know there's a lot of mathematics that is not known
um and we're having to try and build that and that's part of the reason it's hard work i mean
you know when it comes to general relativity for example you know one understands how tensors work
in integer dimensions one understands how calculus works in integer dimensions you know people learn
univariate calculus you've got one variable they learn multivariate calculus you've got two variables
three variables whatever what does calculus look like when you have two and a quarter variables
nobody knows but we need to figure that out and that's what this infra geometry thing that i was
was mentioning earlier that's kind of that's what that story starts to be about is how do we define
the the whole structure of mathematics starting from things that are very different from space as we
normally think of it but um uh let's see you were just asking about um um i mean i i think i was mostly
making an excuse excuse for why we don't know what photons are but i'll mention make another comment
which is one feature of black holes is from the outside black holes pretty much all look the same black
holes they have a certain mass they have a certain analog of spin um but you know any black hole of a given
mass and spin like thing kind of looks the same even though different black holes might have different
crushed civilizations inside them but from the outside they look the same so one of the long time
mysteries of physics has been why do all electrons look the same and the you know it is i think far from
impossible that they only look the same from the outside and in other words that there is in a sense
there's an inside that might not be the same and but like black holes from the outside they all look
the same you know i don't know whether it will turn out to be that way but my guess is that there is a
very close connection between black holes and particles and that's something that is not nearly as
obvious in continuum models of space in continuum models of space black holes i mean you know particles
generally are thought of as as as infinitesimal geometric points in in continuum theories you know
the electron is just a point and quarks are just points and there isn't really a a a way of you know
taking them apart in our models there is we don't know exactly what they're like inside now you asked
about things like electromagnetism and so on um and the the idea of well local gauge invariance the idea
that there are um that you know it's kind of like you have an electric charge and it produces an
electric field and the electric field you know goes out like a you know like a hedgehog or something
actually real hedgehogs don't really look this way but it has spines going out in all directions
um you know it has it has pieces of field going out in all directions and then always the question is
if you move that electron how does if you go far away from the electron how does the moving the
electron affect the electric field and what we know is that that that what has to happen is that
there has to be this wave that goes out that sort of resets the each of these directions of the electric
field and that's what corresponds to an electromagnetic wave that's what and and it's kind of this this sort of
uh communicating the information about where the charge was is something for which you need
photons for which you need electromagnetism and so there's an analog of that in our models where
again we don't know the details of how this works but where there's essentially what um
this this idea of sort of here's now let's see how to put this so you know when we think about
this hypergraph space is an emergent feature of this hypergraph when we look at it in the aggregate
even though we've got all these details about all these little pieces of hypergraph when we look at
it you know zoomed out it's it it seems like continuum space but there are potentially
aspects of this hypergraph that are not like ordinary physical space there are sort of details of
the hypergraph inside which we can think of as being like some other kind of internal space
the kind of thing that is the standard model of electromagnetism for example where there is
kind of a an internal degree of freedom that is associated with every point in physical space
that is the thing that corresponds to the gauge field for for electromagnetism well this idea of of
this notion of sort of a a a way of picking a direction in this kind of internal space this
idea that you have to make a connection between the directions that have been picked in different
places in physical space shows up in a very concrete way in our models and that that kind of shows us
sort of how the whole structure of of gauge and very local gauge invariance and gauge fields and
connections and so on seems to work again we don't know as you know the details hopefully as time goes
by will be pinned down in in in uh more precisely but the qualitative picture is as you try and figure
out these sort of internal directions internal degrees of freedom that we that correspond to aspects of
this hypergraph you have this issue of how do you align what you consider to be the you know the zero
direction or something in this hypergraph at different places in physical space and that's that alignment
the need to have that alignment is what leads to connections and and the whole structure of local
gauge gauge gauge theories and so on i mean you know this this whole issue of um uh um
of kind of what um um you know i think you we were talking earlier about inevitable about sort of
geometry the emergence of geometry i make the comment that um this really ad object one of the different
ways it plugs into existing thinking about mathematics is it's closely related to this
incredibly abstracting the infinity groupoid of gross and deke and so on which i thought i would
never care about in my life i thought it was just one of those things that floated off into the far
reaches of pure mathematics and would never be of relevance to me but actually it turns out it is
mathematically very similar to the the structure of this really ad thing and it has i mean roughly what happens
is uh oh i know this gets this gets i mean this is it's basically yeah i mean there's just a very
elaborate piece of pure mathematics that uh that also has as a hypothesis the sort of inevitable emergence
of geometry and that hypothesis is is basically closely related to the to the emergence of kind of
something like continuum space in our models it's kind of the same it has it has it comes from the
same mathematical place as this growth and deep hypothesis about inevitable well inevitable topology
in that case but in the end inevitable geometry from these um uh from these kinds of setups you mentioned
so this idea that particles might be defects right it's quite interesting because you might ask the question
you know when when i produce a defect in my network uh how does it arise is it is does it pair produce
right for instance what does it what does a um what does a defect actually mean so i imagine the picture
i have in my mind is that you you can update at each step in different parts of the network and over here
you do some local update and over here you do some local update and you go forward a few steps and at some
point you realize that those were incompatible with one another the changes that you made down
here is that what you mean specifically by a defect or no that that's yet a different issue i mean so
in a simple case imagine that you have a a planar graph a graph where everything can be laid out so no
two no two lines are crossing okay you have such a graph now you put into that graph something that is
that is oh a particular there's a theorem in graph theory that says every graph gets to be non-planar
by having a particular subgraph present or two actually one of two particular subgraphs present
in that graph so there's a graph if you have um like you have three points and you have another three
points and you're joining each each point to every one of the three points on the other side of k33
subgraph then then sort of that's a a a lump of non-planarity that can can exist now once you have one
of those lumps of non-planarity you never get to get rid of it if you are rewriting this graph but always
preserve in planarity that lump of non-planarity is essentially a defect you can't get rid of if
you have two such lumps they can wander around and eventually they can cancel each other out
but if you just have one it's stuck so that's that's kind of the the junior version of uh of
how you might have sort of topological defects in a graph what the more senior version of that is
that's what the graph theorist i mentioned earlier said come back in 100 years and we may
know more about it um more or less um the uh uh but that's something for which we have toy models of
this but it's i mean it's just one of these things that you have to you know by by doing a bunch of
computer experiments and by thinking carefully about them i fully expect that we will know a lot more
about this we don't right now but that's the that's the rough picture of what what can happen now in in
the case of um uh in the case of well a black hole you really have to think not about this hypergraph
but about the causal graph because the black hole is kind of this this um uh lump of of um uh this kind
of causally disconnected region inside the causal graph so it's yet a different level of kind of of
defect that you're looking for there but i think um i mean in terms of of okay so how should you think
about for example pair production um okay so in our our physical space is knitted together by all these
little update events happening and so the usual picture in quantum field theory which is rather
confused is that in the vacuum there is an infinite amount of production of virtual particle antiparticle
pairs and so on um and uh the um um actually here's an interesting thing i just just thought about
this recently so first time i mentioned this um the uh when you think about a particle an ordinary
particle like a photon electron whatever in standard particle physics it has a certain mass it can move
around it can move with a certain momentum it's just it's a real particle it is you know has its definite
mass and it moves around and so on but there's this notion of virtual particles that's a feature of
quantum field theory that's been thought about since the 1920s where a particle like a photon can exist
for a short period of time you know usually photons have zero mass but a virtual photon can have any mass
it wants but it can exist only for a very short time and it is the the what one has in in the vacuum of
physical space is lots of virtual particle antiparticle pairs generated for very short amounts of time
that then sort of you know disappear the vacuum will produce a particle antiparticle pair it will
exist for a very short time then they will annihilate again so the thing that um uh well essentially the
the the um there's a question in physical space a particle is a lump of reality that can undergo pure
motion that can move around in physical space without changing its character okay that's sort of the
defining feature of a particle so it um okay so the question is what is a virtual particle and i think a
virtual particle is the direct analog of that in branchial space that is that a thing that can move
around without change in branchial space is effectively a virtual particle i i don't know for sure yet but i
think that's i think that's how it's going to work out um and so what why is that well so so the picture of
the vacuum by the way in uh most of the time there's all this activity in the vacuum and that activity
is most of the time in our models not readily decomposable into saying oh there's a virtual
photon anti you know there's a virtual electron anti-positron pair or something like this it's it's
just there's activity in the network and it's not oh we can decompose that into oh there's this particular
lump that corresponds to an electron here and we can distinguish it from this particular lump that's
a positron here um it's something where most of the time most of that activity is much more jumbled
up than that if you insisted if you said i've got to make a decomposition of all these all this all
these details into something as you do in quantum field theory into definite modes like you know you've
got your string wiggling around and you say well actually it's a superposition of you know the
fundamental notes that's a single uh you know a single sine curve and and the and the first harmonic
that's a thing that wiggles once and the second one that wiggles twice and so on you can describe
any shape of of curve you know by that Fourier series of a sum of sine curves and that's what's done in
quantum field theory to describe the vacuum as this infinite sum of different particle excitations
but the fact that you can really identify say this really is a particle excitation in our models
you're at a much lower level and most of the time you can't sort of you it is not useful to say oh it
actually this this just random update here can be thought of as a little piece of this very complicated
electron you know structure that existed there so it's kind of um you know what we're what we're seeing
is something below the level of these particle antiparticle pairs um and as i say my my my recent
guess is that uh you know i've been wondering what is motion in branch hill space what is it what and
what corresponds to a particle what what is a what is a thing that maintains its identity through
through branch hill space and my guess is that it is effectively a virtual particle but that's a that's a
future a piece of a future future science so to speak because i really haven't haven't figured that
out in detail so one question i have is as you mentioned particles are coherent through time right
you can update with any rule possible right at any at any point in any step of the process right
so how does coherence arrives in your models well okay so look the thing is each it's complicated
because with a given rule you you have you know if you have a let's say you you're dealing with a
given rule then there will be certain kinds of for example let's say it's a rule that preserved
plenarity of graphs then that rule will never be able to destroy the k33 subgraph
it's it's stuck with that a different rule will be able to destroy that but in our perception of
the universe we are localized in rural space just as we are localized in physical space so for us we're
mostly looking at this bundle of rules that are sort of nearby in the real space and so for us there
are certain things that will you know that will be coherently the case because we are localized in
rural space now that's because we're observers like we are if we were just like in physical space if we
were observers who were you know where the parts of our minds were scattered over the surface of the
earth for example we would have a different perception of the world than we do i mean you know if we were
uh and that's a you know the fact that we perceive the world we perceive definite objects in the world
and so on is a consequence of the of the fact that we are localized perceivers of the world by by that you
mean there's like a weighting on which rules can be taken in each update sort of like in quantum mechanics
well no i mean in in you know it's like saying we are at a particular place in rural space we might be
at a different place in rural space but just like we might live in a different galaxy but we happen to
live in the galaxy in which we live and given that there is certain perception of what happens in the
universe that we get you know we because we live in the galaxy we live you know it's central black holes
of a certain size and so certain things happen in our galaxy if we live in a different galaxy we you know
even though the laws of physics are the same we would perceive different things to be going on
and so i think it is in in rural space that because we are at a particular place in rural space the
universe we perceive the universe to operate in a particular way in fact my my view of that is every
mind we can think of as being at a different place in rural space and minds that are closely aligned
are nearby in rural space you know the the humans with similar educational backgrounds are nearby in
rural space and by the way you can ask the question what is the analog of particles in rural space and
that one i think i know i think the analog of particles in rural space is very bizarre thing is
concepts so for example in one brain there are all these neuron firings that happen but somehow we
package up those neuron firings into this thing that we can transmit to another brain you know as i
try and yak about things you know maybe i am communicating some of what's going on in those
neural firings in my brain and i'm communicating them by packaging them up into something that can be
transported to a different part of rural space without much change a concept a word whatever else that
you can then unpack in your brain and get something like the same concept so to speak get you know get
a corresponding set of neuron firings and as we you know as we look sort of further away in rural space
you know we get to the cats and dogs they have only certain kinds of things that we can successfully
communicate we get further away to other kinds of systems it becomes very hard to understand the
alignment between the way we think about the things and the way other systems think about things
i suppose one distinction would be so in the real world there's sort of nothing that we see in
between an electron and a muon right there's not sort of some i know that in your writing you talk
about this sort of inter-concept space right and so if if concepts in the space are particles
this sort of that's a good question yeah right this this uh i i suppose the idea would be that you
would want these to be discrete things where you can't through some continuous process go from one
to a different concept that's an interesting issue i mean so this whole idea of inter-concept space
inter-concept space is something that uh i think sort of maps into this ideas about the rouliad
but the place where i kind of came to that is in thinking about generative ai and thinking about
if you train up an ai on kind of a bunch of a billion human images and you say inside the ai all the
kind of the the the kind of the essence of those billion images has been ground up into this underlying
model and then you say well what's in that underlying model other than those those existing
images and what you can say is you can identify in this kind of space of possible meanings so to
speak you can identify this island that corresponds to cats another island that corresponds to dogs
and you say well what's in between those well if you have a generative ai that's producing images it
produces images happily in the space between cats and dogs and they look like things you don't recognize
they look like kinds of things that there could be you know you could have a name for that kind of pattern
but we don't right now and some of those patterns maybe in the future there'll be some
art movement that's very keen on this particular kind of pattern and then there'll be a name for it
but right now there isn't so right now we just have these little islands in the space of possible
concepts but space of possible images we have these little islands that we have names for
and then we have these vast spaces where we don't have names so i think the thing you're asking which
is interesting is is um uh yeah in insofar as when we think about that more dynamically when we think about
kind of let me think about this for a second um let's see
the question is the things that we identify as transportable concepts like cats and dogs
as compared to the things in interconcept space for which we have not formed kind of a coherent
way of describing them how does that relate to yeah yeah i think it's the i think it's the following
thing okay so when we have a particle like an electron it has a definite momentum there's a
thing we can measure about it that's pretty definite or it has a definite mass but the vast amount of
stuff that's happening in the vacuum in physical space we don't have that way of identifying we don't
have a way of picking it up and saying i can talk about this it has a certain mass
and i think that's the analog i think that the analog is that the things we consider as particles
in physical space are the things for which a certain measurement that we can make on them a certain
way of characterizing them is definite like we say it has a certain mass which i think is similar to
saying we can call those cluster of images a cat whereas you know so in other words that that's how
you know what is it well it has a word associated with it what is that lump of activity in the network
in in space well it has a definite mass it has a momentum so we can characterize it as a particle
i hadn't thought about it that way before thank you for asking about that i mean that that's a i think
that the um um so you know i think i think that's right i think that the the question of of what um
sort of we call it a particle because we have a definite thing we can measure about it see see to
know that that thing was the same as it moved through space we have to say well what aspect of it is
the same as it moves through space because if we say let's identify what atoms of space it's made of
it's going to lose every time it's going to be different as it moves but we have to say you know
the thing that moves you know the the glass that moves from here to there you know it's made of
different atoms of space but yet we say look it's the same glass but imagine this was really close to
a space-time singularity this glass would not maintain its shape as it as it moves through space
the fact that it maintains its shape i mean in in actuality the earth's gravitational field will
be just a little tiny bit different here versus there and this glass that we think of as circular
here it won't really be circular in a sense when we if it was perfectly circular in one place as we
change the gravitational field we change the curvature of space it won't be perfectly circular
anymore but the fact that we say yes it's the same glass as we move it from here to there
that's a consequence of the fact that the measurements we're doing on the thing make
us agree when it's in one place versus another and i think that's it's the same that's that same idea
of the thing we are the thing we're identifying is it's cat-like so to speak and that's and you know
that's the aspect of this of this in in concept space so to speak that we're identifying i think that's
kind of the analog of this i think that's that's a um so the fact that we think it's the same electron
is because the things we're measuring about that electron are things that will be the same even
though if we were to get inside that electron and ask what atoms of space is it made of or some other
detail then it would be different this is a little bit out of left field but do you think
that it was in some in hindsight was obvious that llms were going to work absolutely not no absolutely
not no it was not obvious at all it was and and the you know the fact that llms work is a scientific
fact about humans and human language i mean in other words nobody knew what uh i should just say i mean
large language models for people yes yes we're talking so chat gpt this sort of thing from from
physics into uh um and uh no i mean you know i had followed these things for years i mean i started
working on i worked on your own that's back around 1981 and i could never get them through anything
interesting and i sort of gave up and it was the big surprise happened in 2011 when it turned out that
if you kept training a neural net long enough if you kept giving it enough examples and saying you
know adjust yourself to follow these examples and you kept on doing that for long enough the neural net
would learn things it was completely not obvious that that would work nobody knew in fact many people
including myself sort of guessed that the right thing to do is to try using simple neural nets to do
simple things and that turns out to be much harder than to use complicated neural nets to do complicated
things and i finally have understood this in fact it's something i've been working on recently
kind of the fundamental reason that machine learning works it's not at all obvious it will work
it's not at all obvious that you can and by the way the reason that something like chat gpt works
is that well okay so what is chat gpt doing it's basically trying to continue sentences trying to
continue pieces of text and it's trying to do that by using the example of what's on the web
so we have a sentence like i don't know uh i don't know why i always use this one you know the cat sat
on thee and you know if you look on the web you'll find a bunch of web pages where the next word is mat
and so it's a pretty good guess if you saw the cat sat on thee that the next word should be mat
but what's happening is the fact that you can go on and make a big long essay you won't find explicit
examples on the web of this 20 word sequence that you have to give the 21st word for you won't find
that so what has to happen is somehow the neural net has to take the examples from the web and make a
model whose extrapolation agrees with what a human brain does and the fact that that can be done using
these neural net models is completely non-obvious because it's you know and the fact that it works
i think is a consequence of the fact that those models are similar enough to the way that brains are
set up that they generalize in more or less the same way that brains generalize but the fact that
that even can be done for language is not obvious and in fact i think what it really reveals is that
there are regularities in language that we didn't know were there so for example we're very familiar
with the fact that you know in a language like english you know sentences tend to go noun verb noun
but there are many sentences that go noun verb noun that we would say that sentence is just nonsense
but it turns out that there is more structure there's kind of a semantic grammar i think of what
sentences can make sense and effectively what was done in these neural nets is they learnt that semantic
grammar they learnt the construction kit of how you can put sentences together and they've done it
in a very roundabout and complicated way but the end result is a kind of scientific fact about how
you put sentences together and that's that's what you know that's the that's the sort of miraculous
seeming thing is they're successfully able to spin out lots of text that kind of makes sense because
it's following this construction kit that they have effectively correctly extrapolated from a trillion
words deduced from the web or something so it's um but now you know i just recently was working on
the problem of why does biological evolution work you know why is it the case that you can uh why why do
you when you change the genome just a little bit why do you not just always get stuck why are you not
always in a situation where you can never get better where you can never get you know the longer
neck giraffe or whatever else and this is it's quite an interesting thing because it's actually
relates to our friend computational irreducibility that we started out with if it wasn't the
computational irreducibility neither biological evolution nor machine learning would work
and and the reason is that you're in this in biological evolution you've got some genome
it produces an organism so to speak that has some particular form and the question is as you make
the small changes as you make a bunch of small changes to that genome what happens how how you
know there are all these different directions you can go in this kind of space of possible organisms
and the issue is do you get stuck and the point is because of computational irreducibility there's
enough effective randomness in what happens in all those different directions that with overwhelming
probability there is a way to improve it could be the case that what you'd see in all these
different directions was similar enough that if there if one direction didn't let you improve no
other direction would let you improve either but because of computational irreducibility there's there's
this that you will tend to be in a situation you're with overwhelming probability you'll be in a
situation where there's enough difference between these different directions that one of them will be a way to
get better so to speak and it's kind of an interesting thing because i found this very
minimal model for biological evolution in which you're generating these computational patterns and
what you see happening is you say i want a pattern that lives as long as possible for example and what
you'll see happen is it has some underlying rule which lets it live for 10 steps let's say and then
you say well mutated a bit mutated a bit it will have a way to get better because some it won't there'll be
enough effective randomness produced by computational irreducibility that it will have a path to
improvement and as it gets better you get these bigger and bigger patterns and they get more and
more complicated more and more ornate and it kind of looks like the fossil record because it's kind of
like first it had one little idea then it built on that idea then it kept building on that idea and
eventually made this very complicated thing and by the way there was a different original idea it could
have had that would have been sort of a different branch in the tree of life and so what you see
but what you see is these very ornate solutions to the problem of living for a long time let's say or
generating a particular output and i think the same thing is happening in neural nets and i think what's
happening is that the what you're doing by doing all this training and so on is you're producing these
incredibly ornate patterns of what happens inside and so when you say well what's it really doing why does it
work well it's it it is not there isn't just some simple mechanical kind of engineering explainable
type thing that's going on instead and you have to see the pictures to to really appreciate this
that you know instead it's this very elaborate kind of pattern of behavior that happens to achieve
some particular objective and that's my guess about what you know when we nobody's been able to really
unpeel you know that's a pretty complicated mathematical structures and it's been very hard
to kind of get to the essence of what's really going on in these systems you know i tried back
in the beginning of the 80s and i i i got some distance and then i decided neural nets were too
complicated and i simplified them to get to these cellular automaton things that i've studied a lot
and you know then for the next 40 years that's what i've been using as my sort of go-to model
for very simple systems and now i finally got some kind of merger of those two kinds of things
which i think will allow one to kind of get a more intuitive sense of what's happening
inside a neural net and why why that actually works it's funny when we started our conversation
you talked about how we we are now entering a new era of physics right so for the past 300 400 years
analytics and uh calculus and you know this sort of thing were really where you'd go to if you wanted
to make progress in physics but uh now in the last few years we have ai coming on board as well not
just computation but ai can ai really be creative in in in the sense that can can it really extrapolate
or can it only interpolate and within that context will ai be able to help us solve science solve
physics at the end of the day okay so several different things i mean first of all in the solve
science you know we run right into computational irreducibility here because if you are asking the
question can a neural net you know what we can't figure out by you know we haven't been able to find
a formula or something for such and such a thing will the ai be able to do that well the problem
is there just isn't any way to find such a formula we're stuck so the ai is not going to do any better
and in fact what we will be best off doing is just doing the computation so to speak so i think that's
that's the clear answer to that now in the question of sort of the creativity of ai being creative is
easy the question is whether what you get is something you care about in other words you can get
some random collection of pixels it's very easy to get in and never seen before random collection of
pixels the question is will that random collection of pixels or what you might think of as a random
collection of pixels will that collection of pixels be something that we humans care about
and that's i think a you know the way that ais have been trained is on things that we humans have
decided we care about and so this question of whether whether you'll be able to find things that
whether they're sort of putting just sort of randomly choosing things will we get to things
we care about you know i've spent a lot of my life studying the kind of computational universe of
what all possible programs do and what you discover there is there are these programs that
do these amazing things you would never have thought of and when you first see them you say that's
really neat i don't know why i care other than i can see it's a very intricate pattern and it's very neat
but various times in my life at least i realized oh my gosh that pattern that i just thought was neat
turns out has some big technological consequence or some big scientific consequence and it wasn't just
neat so to speak it connected to something that i care about we see the same thing in mathematics you
know you can go off and you can enumerate all possible theorems but most of the theorems you can enumerate
will be ones that you know we don't have a reason to care about we build up this kind of sort of social
structure of the paths and mathematics that we care about and it's the same thing i think in in uh
you know in this question about will we be able to find sort of theories that we didn't think of
by by sort of rattling around in a sense my whole physics project is about doing that i mean it's about
starting from kind of not starting from the universe as we know it and trying to reverse
engineer what's happening it's instead about starting from all possibilities sort of the the
the creative effort of coming up with all possibilities and then seeing what the consequences of that are
so i think you know as a practical matter uh you know a lot of the technology i've spent a lot of
time building is the things that human brains are not very good at doing it's building these big towers
of computation that are something that we can do with computers that human brains don't do very well
what what sort of the current round of ai and neural nets have given us is a way of doing things
that human brains do do fairly well but now we can do them in some some kind of automatic way that's a
very useful kind of linguistic interface to these kind of deep computational kinds of things it isn't
it isn't removing the deep computational kinds of things and it never will because of this
phenomenon of computational irreducibility but it is still and in terms of knowing for example what
you know being able to make sort of analogies between different human things that we've thought
about yes there can be very useful things done done kind of with with the current round of sort of
neural net ai but i think it is it is an interesting point that in a sense the the whole enterprise that
we've been talking about about our physics project and so on is precisely making use of the kind of
creativity of computation to say we're starting off from the infinitely creative thing that is the ruley ad
and we're kind of deciding which slices of it we humans care about because because of the fact that
we're observers of the kind that we are and that and that sort of slicing of the set of infinitely
creative things is giving us the physics that we are currently familiar with were we to change the
way that we are we would perceive different physics and we would end up with kind of a different being
caring about a different part of that kind of creative space well steven it's been absolute pleasure
thank you for coming on the podcast thank you yeah and uh some very interesting questions and you made
me think about some things i hadn't thought about before so thank you very much
um
