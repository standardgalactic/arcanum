now let's get to something controversial unlike this yeah so speaking of john john the first
part of john the greek is often rendered in the beginning was the logos or the word and the logos
was with god and the logos was god now i just brought up this cup here there's an event that
i went to called o'shaughnessy ventures they fortunately gave me a grant to work on something
and over there someone else was given a grant his name is jonathan b i'll put a link to his
channel on screen and in the description as well he was telling me kurt in that verse there's in
the greek there's something called pros p-r-o-s prostatheon yeah yes right right and it implies
that it implies a moving toward or a facing yeah and that connotes something that's distinct
so most christians think of jesus as god not just an aspect of god but as god and sometimes
they'll even pray to jesus but this to me suggests that jesus is not god now in your translation again
i'll put the link on screen to your work you do a similar translation except god is in capitals and
then at one point god is in lowercase so walk us through john 1 1. well uh not he in logos keologos
prostatheonin uh ke logos theos in or in yeah i'm trying to remember the order there but it's actually
uh theos logos in come to think of it it's it's a god the word was or something but it's not the
word there and i say a god because the actual distinction in the verse that or at least that the
verse seems to honor although again structures of predication have ambiguities in greek so but
otheos or ho theos as you'd say in erasmian greek the god is generally the privileged term for god most
high in the ancient world and this is a con a convention in pagan and jewish and christian
thought and for christians uh i mean i honestly believe in the new testament otheos is always always
means god in the sense of father right but this is the logos when it says the logos was god or god
was logos the article is missing there's no there's no article and that's and this was the word god had
a much greater elasticity uh in the antique world that uh it could be used you'll find even say
church fathers using the term when they're speaking of saints john of damascus will speak of saints as
they you know god and of course angels became angels were originally gods within a pantheon within an
israelitic pantheon you know there's just and uh so here what you're having is an assertion not of
necessarily co-equal identity but of continuity it's still saying the logos is god but uh it's not
equating it there equating the logos there with god most high still here here the issues begin to arise
uh and this is quite common right up through the fourth century and christian thought that's still
a very strong what's considered an orthodox strain of thought smaller especially in the east up until
the council of nicaea and after for a long time afterwards as a kind of what would be called a
subordination assumption that god most high is god in the propers of the fathers and then the logos is
defteros fails and you find this say in a jewish thinker like philo but also christian thing if you can
read say eusebius before nicaea gives you a pretty clear notion of what uh what what many believe to
be orthodox christianity which there's not a co-equality there's a continuity but it's vague
it can even in the case of say arianism be you know the the sun can be seen as created and there's
a kind of ambiguity between the notion of creation and generation genema and genema spelled slightly
differently differently that said um and and the reason for this notion of a secondary god is that
god properly so transcendent that he can't enter into direct contact with finite reality therefore
he generates his word you know or his secondary god that the angel of mighty council the king
the chief of the angels to govern creation and to deal with the lower world and then the spirit would be
maybe god too but you know and and but there's a reticence about this right up till very late
several centuries along ever to use the term otheos for anyone other than the father okay and yet in the
gospel of john though you have that in the prologue in chapter 20 the apostle thomas when he
speaks to the risen christ doesn't people think he actually touches christ rather christ invites him
to touch but he doesn't instead he falls to his knees and says oh here is okay of the asmo oh that
you know my lord and my god and there he seems to be addressing jesus as otheos as god most high now this is
extraordinary the gospel of john also is full of statements like he has seen me has seen the father
of i and the father are one so so while the prologue of john seems to maintain this distinction
this distinction in other ways is breaking down and then climactically in chapter 20 which is probably
the original ending of the gospel before that beautiful dream like chapter 21 was added uh
goes so far as to address jesus as otheosimo god most high and this is the debate going into the fourth
century is this an honorific is he saying this to proclaim that just how high jesus has been raised
in the esteem of the heavenly powers due to what he has accomplished or is it a statement
of who he is eternally and i could go on a great length of what happened at nicaea and after i mean of
course there is the issue of imperial pressure the new the newly christianized emperor constantine
wanting some sort of uniformity of confession but it's also the case that there's a very real
line of reasoning going on there that what had happened in christ and what happens in the spirit
is real union with god god the father and such union is possible impossible is something that can't
be accomplished by a lesser agency by spirit so if we believe this if we believe
otheos really is present in jesus and now jesus is really present in the holy spirit in
sanctification and sacrament then there has to be inequality that in some sense you're always
dealing with god himself you know and that's how the later confession finally coalesced for finally
reached its convictions about what the proper language of the trinity is still it would be
wrong to falsify the new testament to pretend that there's a fully developed trinitarian theology there
there simply isn't and um you know uh in the prologue you're still very much in the world of late
antiquity in which there's god most high and then a secondary a defteros who is in some sense the
reflection of god most high but who is turned toward the father as the priest leading the liturgy of
creation did i hear you earlier say that you could read it as saying jesus which is the logos even
though it says the logos but so the logos was a god instead of the logos was the god yeah because
there's a missing article you said yeah interesting but i i i think but i mean the thing is again
we can't think about that polytheistically though it would be a divine being a divine but it's saying
more at the same time well you also mentioned angels could be thought of as gods from before but
not in well i mean the the earliest dominant christology is what scholars call angelomorphic i
mean it was thought to be and and this remains part of the discourse very late in the christian
tradition that jesus is also the uh captain of the angel so to speak the leader of the heavenly hosts
and there was this notion of the defteros as the core fails the uh the one who leads the heavenly choirs
and their liturgy of praise and so he's turned he's the one alone who's because a priest
well except in the novus ordo but generally speaking a priest
is has his back to the people because he's leading the liturgy all everyone turns towards the mystery
of god right and this is certainly how a lot of the early how the christians well into the fourth
century and after we're thinking that that uh you know he uniquely is the highest of heavenly beings
the angel of mighty council the highest of the angels and also the unique son of the father and
is leading the heavenly liturgy this language falls away later as it becomes very much um well i can say
superseded by the the uh the formal language of trinitarian dogma
it this is controversial not because the scholarship is controversial though i want to point out even
you know people of impeccable orthodoxy scholars have known this i mean they've known that arius was
not some strange curious anomaly that he was simply an extreme expression of what was regarded by many as
the orthodoxy of centuries and there's a reason why after the arian controversy
the controversy continued with the anomians and others over you know bishops and priests still
committed to this older view that they thought was the correct view that it was the nicene party that
was proposing a new grammar you know even a new word amausius consubstantial it's not in scripture and
it wasn't in previous christian usage but to this day you say the people even theologians or people
who do christian philosophy but who don't study christian history very closely and don't know
late antiquity very well think that you're saying something you know that's that's just an opinion
it's not i mean it's it's it is the hard and fast data of the time and again as i say you can read
you can see the change occurring in in uh eusebius you just read him before the nicene council on on
who jesus is and then read him after and there's been a change you know yeah i also don't see it as
so straightforward that jesus himself identifies as god now in these examples there's john which is
the first part is just some narrator saying that jesus is god and then there's thomas who says my god
as well as my lord but also when you see anything majestic you go my god to me it's just not so
obvious and also oh oh yeah well it it could be a fervent expression of of praise of god i mean that
was one of the arguments of of the past yeah that was among those who said well you know that he's
not addressing jesus and how can you tell because it's not in the vocative he doesn't say kiri amu k
you know so it could be it it could be um either i love that i'm speaking with you that you know
the greek inside and out well you kind of need to uh if you if you do some of what i do um you need to
know some greek uh it helps yeah and also jesus said when you pray you go to your room you shut the
door so you do so in private you pray to the father and our father who art in heaven right and another
another point he said you're still in matthew now yeah and another point someone said who is good
no someone said called jesus good he's like no one is good but the father and if you ask for anything
in my father and in my name which it seems to me like he's pointing out a distinction between
himself and the father yeah there's one who is good there are two different versions of that verse
there's the majority text and the critical text but anyway yes the point is it seems to be saying
uh in john however again you do have statements that again i don't attribute to the historical
jesus one way or the other i'm just saying in john you have theological statements already emerging which
i and the father are one now again what is that oneness what is that unity that he you know when
he's praying in gethsemane that he had with the father before the ages well you're not going to
get a single and the early church didn't have a single answer and you've got to remember that when
nicaea was the council of nicaea was convened as yet there was no notion of church councils as having
some preeminent and indisputable doctrinal power authority that that too is an emergent
uh phenomenon in in christian history it's not it's not something it's okay well we better call
our first infallible council you know that that that's not what was going on but uh definitely
constantine wanted a clear single voice emerging from what was becoming an institutional support of the
empire if you enjoyed this toe clipping then the full video is linked in the description don't forget
