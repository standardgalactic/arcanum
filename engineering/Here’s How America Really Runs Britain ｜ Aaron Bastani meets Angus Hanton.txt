This process of selling off companies is happening right now.
There are companies that are being taken over.
I mean, two big defence companies, Ultra and Megit,
were sold in the last three or four years.
It's not just that we gave up what industry we had,
we're still giving it up.
It's a process that's going on right now,
and it ought to be a big issue in the current general election.
You'll sometimes hear the phrase that Britain is the 51st state,
and it's inarguable that the United Kingdom does have
a very profound, strong, historic relationship with the US,
not least because we share a language.
When that term 51st state is appealed to,
it often means military alliances or culture,
film, books, music.
But what if Britain increasingly was subordinated to,
shaped by the United States when it comes to business and the economy?
And what if that subordination had intensified
to an extraordinary extent over recent decades?
Of course, the baton of power was passed across the Atlantic
after the Second World War.
That's nothing new.
But the arrival of the internet and the tech giants we take for granted
from meta to alphabet seemingly compound at US power around the world,
but nowhere more so than right here in the UK.
Today's guest has written a brilliant book
about Britain's economic and business dependence on the United States
and how, more importantly,
that shapes the political decisions we make here right at home.
Angus Hanson, welcome to Downstream.
Thank you.
I often say at the start of an interview,
I really enjoyed the book.
It was so informative.
I have to say this was surprisingly informative.
I think it's one of the best books I'll read this year.
Certainly one of the most important.
Before we get onto it, though,
to establish some of your authority, your credentials,
a moment ago we were talking about
a very shrewd investment you made a long time ago
in a gentleman called Warren Buffett.
Can you illuminate that?
Well, it actually wasn't a shrewd investment.
It just turned out to look like that.
I bought one share in Berkshire Hathaway,
Warren Buffett's company,
and it cost £2,000 at the time in the late 1980s,
and it's now worth £630,000,
or $1,000 actually,
so half a million pounds.
And I did it just to get hold of the annual reports.
In those days, you couldn't look them up on the internet,
so you needed to get them sent to you so you could read them.
And I get them once a year still.
So it's worked out well.
But I think Berkshire Hathaway is a bit of a symbol of American capitalism.
It's been an operator in the UK.
It's been the operator of businesses in the US,
but it's also been an investor,
and it's very much focused on how it allocates its capital,
and it's very much focused on going for businesses with high margins
that have what Warren Buffett calls moats that are defensible.
And that's probably typical of many American businesses.
So this book, Vassal State, How America Runs Britain,
we've got a hard copy here, immaculate hard copy.
I thought we'd share my well-thumbed one instead.
All my notes.
It really is sensational.
It's got so many great facts and vignettes in it.
And the essential hypothesis is that the business relationship,
and of course that percolates through to politics
and geopolitics and military and whatnot,
but the business relationship between the UK and the US
is quite unique,
particularly when you compare it to, say,
the US's relationships to other European countries.
So what is so spectacular about America's business presence
in the United Kingdom?
It's mostly its scale.
They have just got so many businesses
that they've owned for a long time and that have expanded,
but there've been these two great prongs of American expansion
in the last 15 years.
The tech businesses, so the big five or six,
whoever you want to count,
Apple, Google, Microsoft, and so on,
but also private equity.
So private equity is a much more under-the-radar activity,
but it's dominated by US companies,
Apollo, KKR, Silver Lake,
and these come, Blackstone, of course,
and these companies have really taken over
huge swathes of the British economy.
And so that's the kind of scale of domination,
but it's also the type of control that the American businesses have.
What I've found in my research is that they've not just bought up assets like property,
but they've bought the, what I call the bridges and the pipes of our economy.
So in medieval times, the thing that you wanted to own was a bridge
where you could charge people a toll and where it was the only way from one side of the river to another.
And that's exactly what the Americans have done in so many areas.
So for example, if you do dating through Bumble or Tinder,
you're maybe dating a British person,
but you're paying an American for the privilege.
Or if you book, if you sell something secondhand on eBay,
you're again selling to a British person,
but paying a royalty to the Americans for crossing their bridge.
The same goes for using Airbnb.
You book to stay in a cottage in Wales from a Welsh person maybe,
and you're paying the Americans 15% for doing so.
But even businesses that we think of as selling are actually often those bridges.
So for example, Amazon, two thirds of its, almost two thirds of its sales
are not things that they store in their warehouses and send out,
but they're things where they're effectively organising the logistics
and a British person is buying from a British supplier,
but paying the Americans on the way.
And of course, there's AWS, their web services, which it's out there,
but when it's all sort of in black and white that we have MI5, MI6,
they base their internet properties off web services,
which are provided by Amazon.
So this is the cloud.
The cloud is American owned,
and it's either Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle,
a little bit of Apple, a little bit of IBM,
but they're all US companies.
And we store all our critical data,
our government stores all its critical data there,
and so do our businesses.
And we pay for the privilege.
Salesforce is another one where software is stored there.
So we're very much beholden to them.
And in the process,
we're paying them for the opportunity to do business at all.
And again, I'm on the left,
and I've thought about these things for a long time,
but there's a few pages where you sort of basically illuminate
lists and lists and lists,
reams of all these firms and these bridges,
these metaphorical bridges in the UK economy
that have been purchased by the US.
And after reading the book,
I went to a retail park.
I live in Hampshire.
And, you know, it's full of SUVs.
It's basically how the UK economy's moved
in the last 20 years, encapsulate so much.
One of which was these stores,
and I'm looking at all of them,
and I'm thinking, who owns that?
Who owns that?
Who owns that?
So much of it's US private equity,
or they're actually just US chains.
And it really made me rethink quite a lot.
You've talked about some of the examples,
you know, from the perspective of Novara.
We operate obviously on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,
but even the tools to edit this interview will be Adobe,
which again is a software service, cloud-based product.
Yep.
Every company you've mentioned is American.
Every company you've mentioned is highly profitable.
And every company you've mentioned
is pretty well indispensable for British production
of podcasts and another media,
and indeed for our day-to-day lives.
But so much so that even when you want to submit tax returns,
you're forced to use American software.
So this is extraordinary,
the extent to which the British state
has adopted American software without question.
And we've had opportunities to make a different choice.
I mean, there was a company, and I illustrated in the book,
there was a company in Manchester
that was offering cloud services
and that could have been a competitor,
a local competitor to AWS and to Microsoft's Azure.
And the government made the decision,
short-term decision,
to go for the cheapest supplier with the biggest capacity.
And then that local company went out of business.
And what government was this?
What year was this?
Well, it's actually been,
that was 15 years ago,
probably 18 now.
And, but, so that was,
as it happens, that was a Labour government,
but it's been consistent between political parties.
And in a way, that's the big,
we're currently in a general election period,
and that's the striking thing,
that neither of the main parties,
in fact, none of the parties,
are highlighting this as an issue.
And nobody's saying,
oh, we've reduced the amount of foreign ownership,
or we'll do something about promoting British enterprise,
or we'll change the tax system
to make it more attractive
for entrepreneurs to hold onto their businesses,
rather than to sell out.
Well, to the contrary,
you had this ridiculous story,
I think only the FT talked about it,
because it was comments made to the FT.
I think only the Telegraph covered it,
in addition to the FT,
of Jeremy Hunt saying that the UK
can have a trillion dollar company,
homegrown,
grows through UK capital markets,
which, for people watching,
they might think,
okay, a trillion's a lot of money,
but maybe Europe's most valuable companies
around half a trillion,
I think, right now.
It's a race between LVMH and Noro Nordisk,
these weight loss drug people.
But also, I think the FTSE itself
is worth about two trillion.
So, 50% of the FTSE through one company.
So, if anything,
rather than actually addressing
some of the points in the book,
which we'll get onto,
the default is still very much denial,
that this is an issue.
Absolutely.
I mean, that's a fantasy on Jeremy Hunt's part.
To get a company of that size in the UK,
with current government policies,
is so unlikely to happen.
I mean, you talked about the scale
of some of these bigger companies.
I mean, if you take the FTSE 100
and add to it the next 250 biggest quoted companies,
so the FTSE 350,
that is smaller now,
all added together,
including our Shell and BP
and Glaxo and everything.
That's smaller now than just Microsoft.
It's also smaller than Apple, separately.
And it's, the FTSE 100
is now smaller than NVIDIA,
a US chip company
that most people haven't heard of.
But that indicates what a tiny player we've become.
So Jeremy Hunt's ambitions
to have a trillion pound company
or trillion dollar company, for that matter,
are really fantasy.
And they're not consistent
with his policies on tax and innovation.
We'll get onto the policies in a minute.
But, you know,
I just about remember
sort of the economy of the 2000s.
You know, for a brief moment,
I think Vodafone was more valuable than Intel.
You know,
its market capitalization was higher than Intel.
And you could look at these stats
and say 2006, 2007,
which is really the high watermark
of that UK services-based
Southeast England model.
And, you know,
the top 20 biggest companies in the world,
of course, BP, Shell, RBS, HSBC.
And, you know,
the UK was a really major economic player.
But actually, today, I think,
I looked yesterday,
even France has three companies
by market capitalization,
bigger than any UK firm.
And that, I don't think,
really registers in the conversation
in this country.
The political class sort of seem to think
we're still operating 20 years ago.
Yes, the political class
don't want to think about numbers.
As we know,
we're run by arts graduates.
And numbers actually,
it turns out, rather matter.
And Britain has shrunk.
Its place in the world has shrunk.
But it's not just shrunk
in relation to everyone.
It's been very much taken over by the US.
I mean, to give an illustration of that,
the US has a lot of foreign investments
around the world.
But on my calculations,
about 30%,
almost a third of those investments
of the US,
all around the world.
About 30% are in the UK.
It's hugely focused on the UK.
And that's because we've welcomed them so much.
And they've done very well here.
Of course, we represent a bridgehead to Europe.
But we also represent in ourselves
an important profit center
for many big US corporations.
So a Tory minister watching this
would be saying,
fantastic,
that's great news.
Your point is that actually
there's an exploitative nature to that.
Absolutely.
I mean,
many Americans listening to it
would say,
this is a great success story.
And of course,
many Tory ministers would.
And culturally,
they are very,
not just Tory,
but Labour ministers
have been very close
to the Americans.
I did a quick study
of Prime Ministers
and Chancellors
and found out
that almost all of them,
without exception,
in fact,
without exception,
over the last 20 years,
have either worked
for American companies
before they came into office
or after they left office.
And I'm including there
doing speaking tours
for American companies.
But yeah,
you're right.
Some politicians would say
this is a success story.
But I think they're wrong.
I think they're fundamentally wrong.
When you're sending
about $100 billion
of profits
back to America every year
inevitably it leads
to the impoverishment
of the country.
And we can see that
because if we look
at the average income
per household,
it's now about the same
as Mississippi,
the poorest of the US states
and notoriously poor.
So we have become
impoverished by it.
But also our taxes
are partly higher,
are higher partly
as a result of this
because if the American
corporations are paying
very little tax,
individuals have to pay more.
So it's meant that we're poorer,
we're paying higher taxes.
But it's done other things too.
It's reduced our community.
One thing I came across
in this study
was how much many towns
depend on a key employer.
And we've lost that
in cities like Birmingham
in Bourneville
and many in street
in Somerset
with Clark's shoes going.
But many cities and towns,
we've lost our,
what you might call
hometown advantage,
the advantage of having
a local employer,
maybe with the owners
living there as well,
but where they'll create
apprenticeships
and they'll pay
for community resources
and leisure centers
and so on.
We've lost that.
By contrast,
you see that all across America
that towns are expanding
and have done very well
on the basis
of this hometown advantage.
And great,
if you've got a company
like Dow Chemical
in Midland
where they've got,
not only is the company
very profitable
and has been generous
towards the local community,
but the owners of the business,
the Dow family,
have been giving lots
of resources to the city.
So we've lost that.
But it's not just that
we lose people.
I think I'd say
to your Tory minister,
I'd say,
what do you say
about the capable young people
who go out to the states
because they're offered
more attractive jobs?
You can't blame them,
but what it means
is the more powerful country
can pick and choose
to some extent
who it takes
in academia and science.
But we also lose treasure.
I mean,
the amount of artworks
going across the Atlantic
each year
is about £4 billion worth.
That works of art often going-
£4 billion?
£4 billion, yeah.
Often going to the Getty Museum
or other American institutions.
I mean,
that's the nature
of a successful empire,
isn't it?
That they have a lot
of wealthy individuals,
a lot of wealthy companies,
and they want to have,
they want treasure.
And they're free to buy it
and they buy it from Europe
and particularly from Britain.
The point about art
is fascinating to me.
I didn't know
it was £4 billion a year.
In the book,
you talk about the example
of my favourite artist,
Joseph Wright of Derby.
Amazing.
You know,
you see just what it must have been like
the sort of early decades
of the Industrial Revolution.
And you talk about a painting
that was sold across the Atlantic,
I think £3.5 million,
Joseph Wright of Derby,
two boys with a bladder,
whatever I can't remember.
That's it, yes.
He's very famous
for the bell jar one
and people are wondering
who the hell is Aaron talking about.
They are sensational paintings.
And it really got me thinking
that on the one hand,
we talk about returning
the Parthenon marbles
back to Greece,
which I support,
quite right.
But it's interesting
at the very moment
refusing to, you know,
send that stuff over there,
we're also sending
a really important heritage
of this country,
the Industrial Revolution.
We're sending that
across the Atlantic.
Yes, we're repatriating treasure
at the same time
as being plundered.
Yeah, it's a paradox
and very little noticed
or commented on.
I mean, the best
that the British government
have done is they've said,
well, we'll have a period
of pause when something
wants to be,
when someone wants to export
a work of art,
they must put a notice
out to the museums
to say,
would you like to buy it?
Well, that's all very well
in a world where
we had enough money
to do so.
But again and again,
the British Museums,
British Museum itself
and other museums
in Britain say,
actually,
we can't afford it.
We've spent our budget
for acquisitions this year
or we're in a divesting mode.
I mean, it seems
like a fair trade to me.
Give the Parthenon marbles back,
give the Benin bronzes back
and we'll get Joseph
from Rift Arby.
I quite like that.
But anyway,
yeah, that was a real shock
to me,
that four billion figure.
And like you say,
you use the words there,
an empire.
And often,
and it's very important to say,
you use the words,
this is a book about business,
not politics.
It's mostly about business
and it's very much pro-British
rather than anti-American.
Yes.
I'm not anti-American in it.
But I think the business
spills over to the politics
in many important ways.
It's,
the Americans don't just have
a business interest abroad,
they have business interests
that they support.
And in the last few years,
the number of people,
for example,
in the American embassy
has gone up by 50%.
They're not diplomats.
They're not concentrating on,
some of them are,
but the extra ones
aren't concentrating
on more diplomatic activity.
They're concentrating
on supporting their businesses.
And there are many situations
where there are questions
about regulations,
where the American government
lobby very heavily
in favor of US companies.
And of course,
they want to,
they want to retain control.
Elon Musk says that
Twitter is our town square,
which was a reasonable
description of it.
Our town square is,
in that case,
is controlled from California.
But that's true of
Facebook meta as well.
So we've allowed,
and I think that relates
to politics too,
because these are places
where our political discussions
take place.
But I mean,
fundamentally,
if we want to make
a political decision
that the Americans
don't agree with,
we will hear about it
and it will change.
Often it's behind closed doors,
but there was a case
a few years ago
with, under Boris Johnson
with Huawei,
where the Americans
didn't want us to have
Huawei kit
in our telecoms equipment.
And they said so.
And we said,
oh, well, we'll look at it.
And the British government
consulted the experts
in the intelligence community.
And the experts said,
no, it's fine.
There are one or two places
where we shouldn't have it,
but it's fine in telecoms towers.
And the Americans,
oh, no, it's not.
And there's huge public
spat where Donald Trump said,
you better not have it
or there'll be no trade deal.
By the way,
there still isn't a trade deal.
And the British said,
well, okay then.
And they climbed down.
So most of the time,
our interests are aligned enough
that you don't get this
sort of dispute.
But if we step out of line,
the Americans will make sure
that we conform
with what they think is important.
And we're having a debate right now
about nuclear,
not nuclear power.
That's the Chinese and the French,
but nuclear submarines
or more specifically,
Trident missiles,
which of course are manufactured
and serviced in the United States.
Yes.
And so when people talk about
trying independent nuclear deterrent,
we can, you know,
some people would say
it's not a deterrent.
We don't have to go there today.
It's very questionable
whether or not it's independent.
Because if you have something
which is being serviced
in a foreign country,
it strikes me
that's arguably not the case.
In the political debate,
I've not heard it called independent
for some years now.
I think the reality is
that government and civil servants
are stopping using that expression
because they know
that that's a sham,
that there's no situation
politically or technically
where it could be used
independently of the Americans.
Well, technically is the one
I find interesting, right?
I mean, politically that's fine
because you're in a,
well, I don't think it's fine,
but you're in a political alliance,
you have collective security.
I sort of grasp that.
But technically is the one
I find fascinating.
Because I haven't got
especially strong views
on nuclear weapons.
I think we should have,
fewer countries should have them.
I think we should ideally
have a world without nuclear weapons.
But I understand the arguments about,
well, why would you want
to get rid of them
when you're allowing Iran
to have them, et cetera, et cetera?
I think wealthier countries
should have as few as possible.
I think that's a sensible way to go.
What I find fascinating
is that there aren't
centre-right politicians
in this country saying,
we want nuclear weapons,
but it should be a homegrown version
like the French.
That's what I find fascinating.
And I think sometimes
the argument of for or against
misses that broader point actually,
because you care so much about this.
You're saying the literal defence
of the realm is impossible
without this technology.
And yet we depend on it
from elsewhere.
Yes.
We've got some very weird thinking
going on in government
when it comes to our relations
with the US.
And one of the things is
we say we wouldn't allow,
I don't know,
say the telegraph
to be taken over
by a foreign owner.
But it depends
what you mean by foreign.
If it's from the Middle East,
no, definitely not.
If it's from America,
well, maybe they're not
so foreign after all.
But for me,
foreign is foreign.
And the British ought to
and should be able
to control their own destiny
and their own assets.
Well, I mean,
Rupert Murdoch at News & National,
he is a US citizen.
He is.
And he's effectively sold Sky TV,
so that's now American.
Again, many people think of it.
What we find is that
when corporations
are taken over by Americans,
they often don't rebrand
as American.
They allow people,
consciously,
they allow people
to carry on thinking of them
as British organisations.
So Boots, the chemist,
still uses all the reference
to Nottingham
and 19th century.
But, I mean,
Boots is owned
by Walgreens in America.
The same goes
for recent takeovers
when Hotel Chocolat
was taken over
by Mars Corporation
a few months ago.
They carried on
referring it
to a British chocolate maker.
So they're quite sensible
in keeping the local branding.
And the result is
that many ordinary people
and indeed many people
in the policy community
don't realise
just how many
of our companies,
of the companies
with which they trade,
are US owned.
I mean,
it goes down to everything.
I mean, coffee shops,
people think Costa
is owned by Whipbread.
Well, it was,
but now it's owned
by Coca-Cola.
And Caffe Nero
as well as owned by...
Caffe Nero is owned
by an American
who lives in London,
an American individual.
Right.
And Starbucks, obviously.
Starbucks is obviously
from Seattle.
A lot of coffee
is sold by McDonald's.
So, yeah,
pretty well the coffee markets,
the retail coffee markets
sewn up.
High margin market
and one where
it's increasingly hard
for people to compete.
Do your patriotic duty.
Go to Wetherspoons.
I wouldn't say that.
It's not,
it's not,
it's illy.
It's not bad coffee,
but before people
have a go at me,
I'm not suggesting
that for a moment.
But that does hit
on an interesting problem.
If you're unhappy
about so much
being owned by the Americans,
is the right thing
to do to start acting
in a sort of
hair-shirted way
and say,
I'm not going to order
anything from Amazon,
I'm not going to go
to Starbucks?
It seems to me
that that is not a formula
that works
in terms of the long term.
It's policy change we need.
We need the government
to have a buy British policy.
Americans have a buy British policy.
Most European countries
have a buy,
sorry,
Americans have a buy American policy
and most Europeans
have a buy local policy,
but British don't.
The thing you said
about Boots
as well is fascinating.
I mean,
we made a TikTok
about the history of Boots
a few months ago.
Obviously,
Florence Boot,
Jessie Boot,
and this is still capitalism.
This is still private firms.
Nobody's suggesting
it's radical or revolutionary.
I don't want people
to think that for a moment.
But it really,
that story
of the Boots firm
and what it became,
what it's become,
I think really shows you
an extraordinary trajectory
for British capitalism
over the last 100 years.
People don't know this,
but I think,
is it Nottingham University?
A lot of their estates
were given to them,
bequeathed to them
by Florence Boot.
At one point,
it was the most popular
working class library
in the country,
Boots.
And what it's become instead
is effectively
a tax dodging,
exploitative company,
which rips off the NHS
through prescriptions
and whatnot.
and it's effectively
a means of sending
large amounts of money
from this country
to the United States.
And that shows you
how much has changed.
And your book
just gives example
after example.
You said Bourneville
a moment ago
and Clark's.
I've not heard
the Clark's one.
Can you go into that?
Well, Bourneville
was Cadbury's.
So Cadbury's
was taken over
by Kraft,
wasn't it?
With the RBS funding it?
With RBS funding it
and with various
undertakings
about what factories
they keep open,
which were not able
to be delivered.
Well,
Street in Somerset
is a town
that used to be
dependent on one
business,
Clark's shoes.
And it was
a very successful
company
and a very prosperous town.
And when Clark's
effectively declined
with the growth
of Far Eastern
manufacturing,
the town
lost its heart
and lost
a lot of its wealth
and certainly
lost the apprenticeships.
And so that's
been typical
of the decline
of the UK.
But in many cases
that's because
companies have been
taken over by US.
So that sounds
more like
a post-industrial story
whereas Bourneville
arguably boots
with Nottingham
less so.
I mean you could
you can point
to an inflection
point of a takeover
by a US company.
Are there any other
sort of major examples?
I mean Kraft
is not US
but are there
any other major examples?
No, Kraft is US.
Is it?
Is it not Swiss?
Or it's Swiss?
No, no, you're thinking
of Nestle.
No, Kraft is US.
That is, isn't it?
Absolutely.
And so
there are quite a lot
where the takeovers
have happened recently.
So something like
Arm in Cambridge.
Yeah.
And as you
with a company like that
of course they like
having the research
facility there
but ultimately
the big decisions
for that company
are going to be made
where the headquarters are
and where the listing is.
So that's owned
partly by American corporations,
partly by Japanese
and it's listed
in New York now.
So I think
that there's a whole question
about the relisting
of companies
where because of
CRH,
the Builders Merchant
recently moved
to have an American listing,
Flutter,
the gambling company,
but even huge companies
like Shell
have seriously considered
relisting from London
to New York
and you can see why
with higher valuations there
it's going to be better
for the executives
but also
it's going to be better
for the shareholders.
So there are reasons
why people want
to relist there
but it seems to me
that that's quite damaging
to London
but it's also
it's a first step
in a company
becoming,
changing its nationality.
So what are the major,
you said,
that are undervalued
and it's something
I've always,
I've heard in circulation
a lot,
you know,
FTSE companies
are undervalued.
Explain why that is.
I think it's partly
because American institutions
are better funded
and take a longer term view.
It's partly because
they'll,
it's thought
that they will prosper
more in the US environment,
lower regulations,
more scope for expansion.
So it's about creating
an environment
in which they'll do well.
But we could,
we could take the view,
the British government
could take the view
that it doesn't allow
takeovers
in the same way
that it's done so
in the last 20 or 30 years.
At the moment,
we've got a real,
real jumble sale going on.
All sorts of businesses
are being taken over
and the government
show no concern about it.
There's a big
computer software,
cyber security company
in Cambridge
called Dark Trace.
That's just being taken over
by Tom Bravo,
which is a specialist in,
US,
Chicago-based specialist
in software companies.
And they know what to do.
It's so predictable
what they'll do.
They'll gear up to buy it.
Nothing wrong with that.
Well, perhaps there is
because that gearing
will reduce their tax
significantly
and perhaps increase risk.
They'll gear up to buy it.
They'll tend to increase prices
if they're other businesses
or anything to go by.
They'll tend to reduce costs
and they'll achieve
what they call synergies,
which means sort of cross-selling
and buying collectively.
So it's a well-worn path
and the British government
and policymakers
are doing very little
if anything about it.
The Cadbury example is great
because I think Peter Mandelton
at that time
was the trade czar.
And you have the loan,
I think it was a £7 billion loan
from RBS to Kraft
to buy Cadbury.
So at that point,
it was a taxpayer-owned bank,
all the more remarkable.
And ultimately,
I think it re-domiciles
in Switzerland.
I think the tax domicile changes.
They lay off workers
and they increase the amount,
I think temporarily
because now it's changed,
and I think they increase
the amount of sugar
in the chocolates.
The quality of the chocolate
deteriorated,
including famously
the cream eggs.
Yes.
So it's quite remarkable
that a publicly owned
taxpayer-backed bank
is financing
this crazy set of outcomes
and politicians
aren't really aware
of it being,
you know,
a bad idea.
One of the reasons
these takeovers
are so attractive
to the US multinationals
and indeed
other multinationals
is because they can
to some extent,
to a large extent,
eliminate tax
and that makes
a company more attractive
if you can,
and there are so many
legitimate legal ways
they can do that,
but particularly,
it's around
what's called
transfer pricing
so that you put your trademarks
in an offshore location
such as Cayman Islands
and then your local UK subsidiary
pays these,
for the use of these trademarks,
pays large sums
to the tax haven
and it reduces the local taxes,
local profits,
and almost,
it sometimes eliminates
the local tax
while the real profit
is taken into the tax haven
where it's tax-free.
So this is something
we could do something about,
but it's actually
quite difficult
for the British
in some ways
to act on it
because of the ten
major tax havens,
the British control eight.
So we would have
to be quite radical
and there has been
talk about it
by chancellors,
but it's only been talk.
We'd have to be quite radical
in what we do
with our tax havens.
So far,
all they've gone for
is more transparency,
saying,
well, you've got to say
who owns what,
but that doesn't deal
with the core issue
of allowing them
to operate in that way.
All the things
you're talking about,
I mean,
they're coded as left-wing.
You know,
it's coded tax avoidance,
tax evasion,
taking on the tax havens.
I genuinely don't understand,
Angus,
how over the last ten years
these haven't become
mainstream demands
among centre-right politicians,
centre-right party activists,
voters.
I find it absolutely crazy.
The thing you said
about the trademark,
what's the deal
with Starbucks
in the Netherlands?
So how does that work?
Because I've heard
something like that.
They route certain taxes
through certain jurisdictions.
I'm a bit confused.
So if you can clarify that,
I'd be grateful.
Well,
I have to be careful
what I say
about an individual corporation
because these companies
can be litigious.
But from what Reuters
have researched,
it seems clear
that Starbucks
have got a long record
of minimising their tax
within the law,
but certainly not
within the spirit of the law.
So that they've put
their trademarks
I think in the Cayman Islands
and they can do their,
have subsidiaries
owned in Amsterdam
and they can do their,
I think things like
trading in coffee,
if it goes through
in commodities,
profits on that
are very lowly taxed
in places like Switzerland.
So anyway,
it's not,
it's not about
one particular corporation.
It's,
it's,
it's a pattern of behaviour
that they show.
And actually,
one of the biggest tax havens
is Ireland.
So Apple
and Ancestry.com
and lots of the big
tech companies,
Facebook
and lots of the big
pharma companies,
US pharma companies,
they trade,
trade through Ireland.
So they're selling
into the UK
through Ireland
with a much lower tax rate,
typically 12.5%
if they're paying
the official rate
or if they've got
a special deal,
far lower,
sometimes almost zero,
not much above zero.
But it's been great for Ireland
because they've got a,
they get about
almost 20% of their budget,
government budget,
paid for by the taxes
that they do collect
at these lower rates.
On this topic of Ireland,
you also mention in the book
about how multinationals
kind of cook the books.
I don't mean that
in a sort of accusatory way.
They,
they can,
they can confuse
perhaps GDP figures
and what they're meant
to express.
So often when we think
of GDP,
we think of quality of life,
we think of,
you know,
prosperity,
GDP per capita
is obviously a very good
way of judging that.
Ireland's GDP per capita
is about twice that now.
It's getting there.
Twice that of the UK.
And if you go to Ireland,
it's not,
it doesn't look twice
as wealthy
as much of the UK.
And presumably
that's because of these,
tax dodging multinationals.
Absolutely.
The scale of movements
through the tax havens
is such that it distorts
the position
in the world tables
of GDP.
And so companies,
countries that look
as if they're quite highly,
quite important
in GDP terms
like Switzerland
and Ireland
and Singapore,
once you take out
what are effectively
tax-driven transactions,
their position
in the tables
drops right down.
So yes,
what I found
was that
the British
were very reluctant
to produce any figures
on this.
They don't collect them.
Some of what they do collect,
they don't make public.
But the Americans
are much more open
and much more systematic
in their collecting
of numbers.
And I struck a rich seam
with the
Internal Revenue Service.
There's an obscure page.
It's absolutely
not advertised anywhere
and you have to search
quite hard to find it.
And when you do,
you can't just cut
and paste it
because it's a directory
to various PDFs.
Anyway,
one of those
is a set of PDFs
of a spreadsheet
of all the countries
that American corporations
trade with,
the big multinationals,
and how much profit
they make
and how much tax
they pay on it,
how many people
they employ.
It is two or three years
out of date
because it takes them time
to collect
and collate
the information.
But it's an absolute
treasure trove
and it ought to be looked
at far more
by the British.
I mean,
here we are,
the country is deeply
penetrated
by a foreign
economic power
and we're not even watching,
we're not even measuring.
And that economic power
is telling us
what they're doing.
If only we'd read
their numbers.
So, for example,
the US
multinationals
annual turnover
in the UK
is now
$800 billion.
Put that into Sterling,
divide by 28 million
homes in this country
and that's equivalent
to £23,000
per household
is the equivalent
of how much
US sales
there are in the UK.
So, it's big.
But they're willing
to give these numbers
and we're just
not reading them.
I mean,
I spoke to,
I did an interview
with Philip Hammond
who was very good actually
and very helpful.
Former Chancellor.
Former Chancellor.
But he was under
the misapprehension
that the Americans
employ just a million Brits
and these figures
reveal that it's
well over
one and a half million
and actually
if you include
indirect employees
people like Uber
and Amazon Flex drivers
it's probably
two million Brits
working for American
corporations.
So, about twice
what the British
think it is.
So, the penetration
is far deeper
and wider
than the establishment
are willing to accept
and they're just
not looking at the numbers.
Yeah, you have a stat here
which is that
US corporations
have more employees
in the UK
than France,
Germany,
Portugal,
Italy and Sweden
combined.
Absolutely
and that's of course
authoritative
because that comes
from the Americans
own figures
from the IRS.
Yeah, I mean
those aren't small countries
France, Germany,
Italy
they're G7 economies.
No, so France is
Germany is a bigger
country than ours
and while we've got
two million
well two million
British employees
work for Americans
the Germans
only have
450,000
but in Southern Europe
in Spain
and Italy
each of those countries
only have 200,000
working for American
corporations.
Nothing wrong
with working
for American
corporations
but it's a good
way of measuring
the extent
to which
they've taken
control of the economy.
There's a great quote
here as well
in the book
before we move on
amazing quote
from Denny Ludwell
from 1930
America conquers Britain
we were Britain's
colony once
she will be our
colony
before she's done
well we're not done yet
I mean the Scots
might have something
to say that
in the next few years
but we're not there yet
not in name
but in fact
but we shan't make
Britain's mistake
too wise to govern
the world
we shall merely
own it
nothing can stop us
nothing
what chance
has Britain got
against America?
Absolutely
very prescient writer
and he was talking
he did a lot
of analysis
of how well
the Americans
were doing
industrially
in the early
20th century
but he could
he could see
the future
and of course
the real turning point
was the
was the second world war
when Britain emerged
basically bankrupt
and the Americans
had extracted
such a price
to help
with the
the sort of
gunboats for bases
deal
which Churchill
said he had no choice
but to do
and
and perhaps he was right
but
from then on
the American
economic machine
was moving
across Britain
but I think
nothing compared
to the last 15 years
this is
this is I think
where people
people say
oh we've always had
Ford
at Dagenham
we've always had
American companies here
but it's about
the scale of it
and as we've moved
to a digital world
that's a digital world
which is owned
by Americans
and as we've moved
to a
from quoted companies
an economy dominated
by quoted
stock market companies
to a world
a bigger
more private
companies
the private equity world
that's where
the Americans
have really
really cleaned up
I mean that is key
because if we had
Peter Hitchens in here
he would say that
the British Empire
dies in 1940
1941
Dunkirk
fall of Singapore
and after that
we become effectively
some sort of dependency
on the United States
and I think that's
that's right
you know
the Second World War
is started
or involves
two European colonial powers
it's ended by
these two
non-European
if you don't include
the USSR
you know
hyperpowers
which they form
the two rivals
of the Cold War
I think that's true
but like you say
with this book
actually
we don't need to
we don't need to
sort of
dig and look back
80 years
this is really
since the arrival
of the World Wide Web
and the early 2000s
yes
and it doesn't have
to be like this
it's not as if
I mean some people say
oh well
this is happening
all over the world
but I mean
we represent
a third of American
foreign investments
we've been
we've been taken over
to an extent
that France
and Germany
haven't
and yet
they are still
under the NATO umbrella
so it's not like
we have to sell
all our businesses
in order to get
to have a
mutual pact
for military protection
it's
they're different things
and
it's one thing
to believe in
free trade
which the British
and the Americans
and most of the Europeans
do
but it's not the same
as believing in free trade
in our companies
we don't have to allow
everything to be taken over
I mean
what the French
did famously
when Pepsi Cola
wanted to take over
their big milk
and yogurt company
Danone
is they
labeled it as
a strategic asset
and they said
our strategic assets
are protected from
takeover
back off
and now Danone
is still French owned
and in a way
it was a strategic asset
because one of its roles
was to
was to support
local communities
to buy milk
from small farmers
and to support
yogurt makers
locally
and
so
yes it's industrial
but it's
the French
recognize the importance
of keeping it
keeping it within
their control
and it's not just
a matter of pride
but it's
it's much more than that
it's about where the profits go
and it's about
who regulates the companies
so the danger
once you've got a
a business that's
that's owned in
in America
is
an anonymous head office
there
across the Atlantic
on another continent
can be making
big decisions
about layoffs
and priorities
and regulation
whether even the
they want that branch
of the company
to exist
I suppose
somebody might be
watching this
and there might be
sort of
you know
ultra liberal person
they say
oh
two bigots
they're talking about
you know
putting Britain first
British
there's a very material
I mean
as I'm a socialist
you do not want
to be
siphoning off profits
to somewhere else
you want your workers
to enjoy high labour standards
you want to be able
to collect taxes
from the companies
operating and selling
goods and services
in this country
and I think
that's
there's a very
important
left wing
I think there's also
you know
it's not entirely
left wing
but I think
over the last
20-25 years
people from the left
have thought
well particularly
the centre left
people like
the Mandelson wing
of the labour party
if they're centre left
centre
you know
they would say
well this is just
you know
it doesn't matter
where they're from
you know
it's unimportant
actually
it's very important
if you want to provide
a well resourced
public sector
absolutely
I mean
my favourite question
in the last three years
has been
who owns that
and of course
I've been using
my Apple
American computer
or phone
and I've been using
Google
American owned
but it doesn't matter
they provide good
information on this
and when I search
who owns that company
it's amazing
how often
the answer is
an American corporation
and just to give
an example
we thought of
during the
Covid pandemic
the British
with AstraZeneca
were the first
to develop
a vaccine
and yet
at the end
of the time
two thirds
of the vaccines
were being bought
almost exactly
two thirds
were bought
from American companies
so
Beyond Tech
and
Pfizer
which we just thought
oh these are
kind of familiar names
these weren't just any names
these are names
of American corporations
so I think it does matter
who owns them
and I think we can easily
find out
using Google
and
Google
and our phone
yeah
and the point about France
I think is key
I like
I think France
does so many things
better than the UK
so many things
and people say
well it's GDP
is lower than ours
it's because they work less
they choose to literally
work less
they retire earlier
they have a shorter
working week
their GDP
per capita
if they work the same
as us
would be higher
because their
productivity is higher
but besides all the
you know
high speed rail
the fact that they've got
I think 90% of the
electricity
comes from nuclear
which they build
their nuclear capability
in terms of
warheads
and what not
entirely domestic
they have a
you know
a domestic
I mean to be fair
we're also
with aviation
we share that
with them somewhat
they have a
domestic industrial
manufacturing sector
which we basically
gave up
I mean that's
that's prior to a lot
of this stuff
and that's about
political choices
in the 80s
and the 90s
Aaron I would say
it's worse than that
it's not that we gave it up
we're still giving it up
this process of
selling off companies
is happening
right now
there are companies
that are being taken over
I mean two big
defence companies
Ultra and Megit
were sold in the last
three or four years
but there are companies
now that are subject
to take over
Dark Trace
in Cambridge
but Wincanton's
just been sold
a big haulage company
with 20,000 staff
so what I'm saying is
that it's not just
that we gave up
what industry we had
we're still giving it up
it's a process
that's going on
right now
and it ought to be
a big issue
in the current
general election
well maybe this will be
the game changer interview
but maybe we'll have to
wait a little bit for that
there is a great stat
in the book
about tech firms
and this is another one
that you know
it's another touchstone
of modern politics
all the politicians
love to say
we're innovative
we're new
we're you know
technologically
in touch
again going back
to Jeremy Hunt
he said that
that trillion dollar company
would of course
be a tech giant
and you say
the FTSE 100
when it was launched
in 1984
had more tech firms
than it does today
just to be clear
the FTSE 100
is the 100
most valuable
listed companies
in the UK
that's a remarkable
statistic
so how did you
work that out
and what are you
what are you
classifying there
as a technology company
well it's interesting
because if you look
at the very few
tech companies
we've got left
they aren't really
tech companies
so I think
probably right move
and auto trader
are the only two
and really
they're using tech
but really
they're marketplaces
aren't they
and so
in terms of
pure tech companies
we've probably
got the accounting
firm in
Newcastle
that's about it
really
so we basically
lost them all
but in many cases
I mean
Deep Mind
was a classic case
which was a very
promising tech company
which Google took over
very cheaply
as it turns out
but I'm sure Google
knew it was a bargain
at the time
so
we've
we've allowed
these takeovers
to happen
in fact we've even
encouraged them
a friend of mine
had a tech company
which he sold
and he said to me
by selling it now
I've got my
entrepreneur's relief allowance
I'll pay maximum
of 10% tax
if I carry on trading
I'll pay 40%
or more tax
on the trading profits
so it pays me
to sell
so we've set up
a tax system
where entrepreneurs
want to sell
but we could find
other ways
of encouraging
people who build up
businesses
to hold on to them
that's what the Germans
have done
with their Mittelstadt
so they've got
a lot of companies
very often specialised
in a particular niche
very often exporters
very often set up
soon after the war
family businesses
but with a kind of
extended family
and community
around them
and they
they wouldn't sell
even for a profit
because it'd be
socially unacceptable
they're embedded
in their community
they provide jobs
they wouldn't be able
to face their community
if they turned round
and said
we sold out
to a foreigner
so it's not just
about the tax
it's also about
the culture
the culture
of keeping hold
of your companies
and building them up
owning companies
to grow them
rather than
to sell them
in fact it's one
rather depressing thing
about British business
advice these days
they always talk about
what's your exit strategy
anyone who's been
in a business discussion
will have been involved
in these discussions
well maybe there isn't
an exit strategy
maybe it's a
stay in the room strategy
maybe it's a
grow the room strategy
so it's
there's a cultural issue
as well as
as well as a tax issue
so you say culture
that's fascinating
because
maybe you don't know Angus
I'm a Marxist
okay
don't hold it against me
and you know
Karl Marx would say
that capital
capital is
money which makes money
it's value and emotion
and
you're always seeking
a higher rate of return
you're in competition
with other capitalists
and that
that's the asset management
private equity model
globalised
core periphery relations
with the US
and the rest of the world
you can map all of that
onto that sort of
Marxist framework
and it makes perfect sense
there's a higher rate of return
by boots being bought
by these people
and effectively
you buy low
and you sell high
or you reduce your cost
you keep on to it
you move your tax base
you do all these things
that can all be explained
through Marx
essentially saying
that's how business operates
then you're making
you say the cultural argument
and this is empirically
what happens right
in Germany, France, Italy
there are very large
family owned companies
that wouldn't do this
and they sort of
fly in the face
of that ultra capitalist
argument of
maximising revenues
shareholder returns
blah blah blah
so
what would be your
sort of political response
then
because I've given the critique
that is the direction
of a purely capitalist society
we don't
you never really live
in a purely capitalist society
sorry to bore you
but you know
when Marx writes
Capital
it's called
Capital a Critique
of Political Economy
he's criticising
ideas of political economy
rather than the
actually existing economy
but it's an abstract
set of values
that we seem to be
moving further towards
in the Anglo-American
countries
and it's a slightly
less developed
set of things
in a set of relations
rather in
continental Europe
so what are you saying
we should be more
like continental Europe
you say it's a cultural thing
how does that work
that would have to be
necessarily
sort of like
nationalist I suppose
or social democratic
or is there
not necessarily
I mean there are
lots of things
we could do
to tweak our
to tweak our business rules
to get closer
to having family
or locally owned
or even cooperatively owned
businesses
but we've actually
moved them the other way
so one of the things
that large businesses
have
is advantages of scale
well we can count
that can be counted
in various ways
but a big advantage
that they have
is the advantage
of this borrowing
using other people's capital
and that has the advantage
for them
that they can
they can take over
bigger targets
but it also
has the advantage
that interest payments
on that capital
are tax deductible
so one of the things
that private equity does
is it typically
borrows so much
that it doesn't
that it doesn't actually
need to pay tax
in the short term
and very often
when they sell out
they've got mechanisms
to be able to do
that very
what they call tax efficiently
or what you would probably say
tax avoidingly
so we can tweak the rules
to move nearer
nearer to your model
I don't think we're
I don't think
these changes will
create a Marxist
way of working
but it will be
it will be less capitalist
I think in a way
what Britain needs to do
is develop its own
form of capitalism
closer to the European model
rather than adopting
the US model
lock, stock and barrel
and also by adopting
the American model
as we've done
we've made ourselves
very open
to this wave of takeovers
The book's called
Vassal State
so I suppose
if you're trying
to condense it down then
by adopting that
US variant of capitalism
we have effectively
made ourselves
open to
sort of predatory takeover
by US business
I think we're a vassal state
in that way
yes
that we've made ourselves
more open
but I mean
a vassal state
a vassal is someone
who works
at the direction
of someone else
and I think
the British largely do
and I think
a vassal is someone
who works
in order to enrich
someone else
and I think in that sense
the British do
but there's another
there's another meaning
of vassal
within the British economy
that we've created
as a sort of
vassal class
a group of people
who work
really
very much
at the margin
they can't afford
to get ill
I'm thinking of people
like Amazon workers
and it's not
a particular
criticism
of the way
Amazon does something
it's a criticism
of the whole
the whole system
of having
employees
who are working
at the minimum wage
having to get
having to live
in places
where it's expensive
to live
having to get to work
without costs
not having
adequate
insurance cover
for
when things
don't go right
so I mentioned
in the book
James Bloodworth's
book
which is an
excellent
analysis
of how
in the real world
American capitalism
works for Uber drivers
and for Amazon workers
and because he went
underground
for six months
with each of
each of four
very low paid jobs
to experience
what it was like
and what he says
is that
it's all right
as long as it's all right
but then if you get
an injury
there's no one
there to support you
and I think
the British model
after the war
and right through
the 60s
and into the 70s
the British model
was and still should be
that we're there
to support each other
and that we don't want
to have people
who are
who are made destitute
because things don't
work out for them
so effectively
a social democratic
model is what
you're talking about here
certainly something
less brutal
than we've got
with the workers
in many of these companies
so when Labour
in the last election
talked about
a national investment bank
and also regional
investment banks
is that a policy
that you think
okay if we're trying
to build an ecology
a bit like Germany
that's something
we should try
well it depends
it depends how
those would work
there's been constant
talk of new banks
and then they're
typically not funded
by people
very well
and not funded
not run by people
who've got a clear
vision of what
they're trying to do
but yeah
finance is important
and I think
we probably should
have banks
that support
certain sorts
of enterprise
that are socially
desirable
what you've got
at the moment
is banks
who are motivated
to support
businesses
that are
they're not worried
about what the business
does
they're amoral
in a sense
so they're
motivated
to support
customers
who have a lot
of collateral
and can make
the interest payments
well that's natural
for a banker
but so yeah
I think we should
have a better
banking system
for enterprise
well particularly
for co-ops
right
I mean co-ops
often are very
they can compete
perfectly well
with private firms
the problem is
during a crisis
they struggle
to access finance
during an economic
downturn
because of course
I'll spell it out
if you're a large
bank
and somebody says
one firm says
I need 500,000
or 10 firms
say we need 50,000
the 500,000
is a better bet
if it's a good
customer obviously
so that's
I mean something
when I was writing
my book
I found really
fascinating
that access to
credit during a crisis
is the real
pinch point
for co-ops
historically
but actually
crises are at the
heart of capitalism
yes
I mean it's a sort
of punctuated
equilibrium sort
of issue
that it's not
just about
what happens
you know
when things
are running
smoothly
it is very much
as you say
about what happens
in the crisis
and my reading
of it is that
with private equity
in particular
this is a kind
of a mechanized
industry
of people
who are looking
for a crisis
they're not looking
for a crisis
in the economy
or their own
they're looking
for a crisis
in a particular
industry
and when that
happens
they're ready
to take over
at rock bottom
prices
and so
we're talking
about the
constant churn
of businesses
and we've now
got this group
of people
who some
people have
described as
being like
vultures
but I mean
they're business
people
but they're
looking for
opportunity
and so
if you're
a private
company
and you're
in trouble
you may get
taken over
but at a
very low price
have you read
Brett Christopher's
on asset
management
I think you'd
really like it
well yeah
asset management
and wealth
management
and another
book as well
when I'm reading
this and I'm
thinking it's
good for our
audience
you can go
on and watch
this on
YouTube
it's
techno-feudalism
by Yans
Farah Fakir
are you familiar
with that
yes
very much
and I thought
I actually
thought reading
this
I thought
this
Brett Christopher's
and Yanis
it's kind of
all
it's a similar
story
you're all
sort of telling
on the
techno-feudalism
point
and again
you talk about
all the different
firms
from you know
oh just
everything
it's crazy
that we depend
on
with the US
and then you go
on to payment
services
Apple Pay
Visa
Mastercard
obviously
Google Pay
I mean
when I
when I swiped in
coming from
London Waterloo
to Bermondsey
I use Apple Pay
and obviously
a tiny fragment
of that payment
goes across the Atlantic
yeah not necessarily
that tiny
yeah what's happened
is we
the US payment
companies have killed
cash
they wanted it to die
we're now at a point
where of our transactions
in the high street
14%
so only one in seven
are done with cash
and many shops
and industry
businesses
refuse to take
refuse to take cash
but it's not
what consumers
often think
is oh well
this is happening
all over the world
it's not
in Germany
58% of transactions
are with cash
they've chosen cash
because
it's
very cheap
much cheaper
for the shopkeeper
it's very easy
to handle
it has some other
advantages too
you're more aware
of what you've spent
if you use cash
whereas
as they say
the credit card
anesthetizes
the pain of spending
so that's of course
very good
for the credit card companies
but there's another thing
about cash
if you're thinking of
normal
ordinary people
that cash allows you
to budget
and many people
still use cash
in jam jars
to work out their
to work out their budget
and why shouldn't they
it's a good way to do it
but it's a bit pointless
if you worked out
your budget
you've got your cash
to spend on something
you can't use it
so
the credit card companies
took the view
that cash
wasn't doing them
any good
whereas
in credit card payments
they're always getting something
it's not just
the front companies
as well
it's the processing companies
that are American owned
companies like WorldPay
which pops up
on the screen
when you've touched it
with your phone
or with your card
so yeah
this is another example
of sort of
almost where we started
of bridges and pipes
it's a
it's something
it's a pipe
you have to go through
to make your payment
and they're taking
a royalty on the way
it's incredible really
because we spoke
to a guy called
Brett Scott
and he talked about cashless
and you know
he said
you have to at least keep
a certain amount
of your monetary infrastructure
should be
physical cash
has to be
and he sets
you know
sets out the reasons why
and so far
the people defending cash
have been
people like Nigel Farage
who are you know
the sort of
the
the tribunes
of the petty bourgeois
in this country
and it's really interesting
if you look at
a sociological difference
if you go
I live in Portsmouth
if you go and hang out
if I hang out
with the partner
of my sister-in-law
Wardrof Cash
she's a tradesman
right
carpet fitters
builders
cash
cash
cash
if you were with
a young
if I'm with my colleagues
here at Navarro Media
London graduates
it's all cashless
it's a really
notable
sociological divide
between the petty bourgeois
and you might say
graduate of the future
or graduate class
and
politically
actually
I had never thought
about it again
until reading the book
the big takeaway
actually
is if we're looking
at this
through the prism
of US imperial relations
you absolutely
want to keep cash
you absolutely want it
or if you're going to
have a cashless system
it should be publicly owned
it should be based
in the UK
yes exactly
we could have
our own credit card system
we did do
we had a company
called Access
and we quietly allowed
it to be taken over
by Mastercard
there could have been
a strategy by government
to say this is
a strategic asset
we want to have
a nationally based
credit card
and when was that
taken over
oh that was a while ago
I feel like I remember
Access
but maybe I'm just
sort of
maybe that's in my
like you know
25 or 30 years ago
right okay
probably not then
but they could have
they could have
chosen not to do it
but there is no
drive towards
protecting national assets
in that way
it's just
there seems to be
just a big hole
in our policy making
well you had
that funny scenario
a few months ago
of Nigel Farage
being debanked
and then him saying
I want a bank
of last resort
and it should be
totally owned
it should be the post
the post office
used to be publicly owned
and they would give you
a bank account
you're thinking
Nigel Farage is coming out
for a public ownership
of financial infrastructure
strange world we live in
yes
and the post office
has just been taken over
by a check buyer
after 500 years
of independence
I'm not saying
for it or against it
but it doesn't seem
to have been
considered
as a strategic asset
and there don't seem
to be enough
protections
for ordinary consumers
and ordinary workers
for that matter
on Amazon
you said about
cashless
great statistic
on Amazon
I think 30%
of online retail
in this country
goes for Amazon
30%
which is crazy
should we just
close it down
should we just say
no that's it
no more
what's the
what's the
what's the ideal solution
really
I know you'd say
we should have
alternatives based in the UK
paying tax here
but in the short term
what to do about
all this is a big question
and it's not an easy question
we've got to start
by recognising a problem
and that's sort of
what Vassal State
tries to do
to recognise
the extent
to which we're
American owned
secondly
we've got to start
measuring
it's an absurd thing
to be trying
to deal with
an illness
when you know
there's an illness
there but you haven't
properly diagnosed it
what it is
so we need to
have a proper measure
so that all
government departments
should measure
what
how much of their
expenditure is made
with companies
of each nationality
it's not an overly
nationalistic thing to do
it's what other countries do
so start by recognising
then measure
then I think we need
to have a buy British policy
as other countries do
so conscious policy there
then we need to
adjust the tax system
so that it's not
so friendly towards debt
and it's not so friendly
towards foreign ownership
we need to make sure
that tax
is charged fully
on companies
from whatever country
they come
and reduce
or eliminate
transfer pricing
in terms of
how we get there
from problems
that are already
entrenched
well that's difficult
we need a very powerful
markets authority
mergers and markets group
and at the moment
they're trying
but they're too weak
and yes
that could allow
that could insist
that people
operate
companies operating here
demerge
different operations
so you could say
for example
that Amazon has to
but this is
to some extent
actually a department
of a US issue
that Amazon
should be broken
down into different
size companies
I think the main thing
is to reduce
further takeovers
but yeah
it's also difficult
Aaron
because Amazon are good
great product
they do deliver
things the next day
they do
have a great
customer service
and
it's very convenient
and they have a huge
range of products
pretty well
anything you can buy
anywhere
not quite
but it's a very
wide range
and
so
it's
we should be careful
not to
not to knock
good service
but
we've had our
competitors
and they should be
encouraged
and incentivized
to fill spaces
in the market
it is very good
I'm not going to lie
I've bought so many
things off
you know
I've got a prime
membership
it is very good
but also
I look at
I look at the
British high street
over the last 25 years
and it's just been
it's been smashed to bits
I mean if you
if you
I like to call it
London Okio
if you sort of
this you know
if you're within
an hour of London
you're fine
if you go to
Winchester
you've got two
Waterstones bookstores
you go a few hours
west to Paul
25 years ago
comparable wealth
comparable high streets
no bookshops
because the point is
the people with those
jobs need to live
in London
you have this
wholly different
when it comes to
offline commerce
there are some
exceptions
you can go
Hay-on-Wye
or Totnes
you know
or other major
cities like Edinburgh
broadly speaking
it's about the
south east
and how close
you are to London
absolutely
yes
so we're a bit
of an island
of wealth
and convenience
and so on
but I mean
Waterstones
is an interesting
example
somebody said
I'm not going
to buy your book
Angus
on Amazon
because I want
to support British
companies
so I'm going
to go to Waterstones
and I said
well I'm sorry
to disappoint you
but Waterstones
is owned by
US private equity
so I said
well I'll go
to my local
bookshop
well I said
good
but I mean
in terms of
Prime
you give that
as an example
where you've got
membership of it
you've got that
because presumably
you get
free delivery
on most things
and you get
a certain number
of free films
and you get
quite a lot
of things
bundled together
now this
bundling
is
of goods
together
by the big
companies
is something
that really
should be challenged
because what it
does is it
prevents small
companies getting
into each
of those sectors
it's a form
of monopoly power
to bundle
stuff together
and very attractive
to you and me
as consumers
to pay our 80
or 100 quid
a year
to be
benefiting
from that
but it's
very anti-competitive
and bundling
occurs all over
the economy
so maybe we don't
ban Amazon
we just ban
Amazon Prime
well no
you could have
Amazon Prime
but you could
say you could
that has to be
it has to be
only doing
free delivery
you have to have
a different service
that people buy
for their
videos and for
their music
interesting
because in France
as I understand it
I think there's
a minimum price
on books
I might be getting
this completely wrong
I think they've got
three times as many
sort of independent
book shops as we do
because basically
you're not really
saving that much
by buying it online
is the point
so there are
things like that
and I mean
I'm totally in favour
of that
I think that's
a very good thing
to do
but my point
I was saying
about what
what Amazon
and what these
big tech companies
have redone
to the UK high
straight over the
last 25 years
it's terrifying
it's very bad
I actually think
it's a big reason
why we had Brexit
I think lots of
people in lots
of parts of the UK
outside of the
South East
walked around
they thought
where I live
looks crap
looks awful
and my worry
is with AI
applications
that really
the changes
over the last 25
years
are just going to
go stratospheric
with AI
and it's going to
be US owned AI
and all the stuff
you're talking about
here is just going
to go to a whole
other level
absolutely
you know AI
is American owned
and to use
chat GPT
I pay my $20 a month
and I'm thinking
there it is
another
but I need to
because it's a good
service
but I would
be happier
to pay £20 a month
to a UK
AI company
but all the things
that I've mentioned
the tax incentives
and the structure
of industry
and the attitude
of ministers
and the way
that government
buys
often
buying from US
companies
all those things
have meant
that it's unlikely
that a British
AI company
can succeed
and prosper
in the general market
so there are
some good
British AI companies
in certain niches
but at the moment
as things stand
if they're successful
they will be bought up
by Google
and Facebook
and others
Final question
is this all the legacy
of Margaret Thatcher?
she changed
the political dial
in this country
in a certain direction
and trying to embrace
a more American
style capitalism
I think it's one
of those things
isn't it
that any discussion
of British economy
always ends up
with concluding
that it was Thatcher
that got us off
to the wrong
on the wrong foot
I think she did
have a very strong
relationship with Reagan
and with the Americans
and she was very admiring
of American capitalism
but I think we've gone
to a different scale
I think she would be horrified
by the situation
we're in now
she was quite analytical
and she would have seen
the extent to which
the Americans
have taken over
so in her
when she was in power
3% of the US stock market
was owned
by Americans
it's now 30%
so even when we talk
of a British company
we're really at best
talking of a 70%
owned British company
although with other
foreign institutions
it's likely to be
a 50% British company
so I think she would
have been horrified by that
but I mean
there were examples
yes
when she fell out
with Michael Hesseltine
over the takeover
of Western helicopters
it was
she was supporting
the takeover
by Sikorsky
the American company
that bought it
in the end
so yeah
it wasn't just
a general
opening up
of capital markets
and welcoming
of the American model
there were specific
government policy decisions
which she made
to support
specific American companies
so I think
you're probably right
I think it did
it did start with
with a lot of it
started with Thatcher
but again
she was before
the internet age
she gave it
a completely different
different dimension
and obviously
well before the AI age
which as you say
will
move things further on
but I mean
perhaps I can ask you
do you think
your dream
in your book
of AI
and other technologies
creating more leisure time
is going to mean
that we won't worry
so much about
the American domination
well no
it's something that
you know
in that book
I couldn't really go into
obviously geopolitics
and
the relationships
between states
which is arguably
a state of anarchy
right
it's different to
I think humans
are inherently cooperative
but the evidence
of the last
several hundred years
is that not
nation states
are not inherently
cooperative
with other nation states
so that is something
that you know
it troubled me
in the book
and I
quite overtly say
I think in the final
two chapters
that really the path
from one to the other
because I do think
that you know
that economist headline
from a few years ago
what happens when
labour becomes capital
we're going to get there
we're going to see
the plummeting
price of human labour
because increasingly
uniquely human capabilities
will disappear
I think
I think the bridge
from one form
of political economy
to another
is going to be something
which looks like
a radical form
of social democracy
and so when you're
talking about
for instance
certain kinds of bank
that can finance
cooperative business
or a different kind
of British capitalism
I think in the short
of the next 20-25 years
yes certainly
I don't
you know
I don't
I don't see that as
and I know that
some people watching
or listening
might really strongly disagree
I don't disagree
with that at all
the trends I talk about
in that book
are really over a century
I mean who knows
right
so there's still
a place for markets
there's still a place
for private firms
in the short term
I just don't want those
anywhere near
things of fundamental
you know
importance to human beings
which would be
the universal basic services
if you want to be
a private enterprise
and make money
you know
make phones
I don't want you
anywhere near the water system
it's low margins anyway
it's quite hard to administer
I certainly don't want
private equity there
so
I think this analysis
can fit in with that
perfectly well
and it's interesting
you said that about Thatcher
if she saw this
she'd be aghast
because I think
she would be
that's what's fascinating
to me now
with contemporary
British conservatives
is that they've
they helped create
a model
a political economy
over the last 40 years
which they don't like
yes
they've encouraged
to be
they've encouraged
us to model ourselves
on the Americans
and instead of just
modeling ourselves
on the Americans
we've created a system
that's welcomed
the Americans in
so so much of
so much of
so many of the decisions
on regulation
and everything else
are made
in New York
and Washington
and in California
one of the extraordinary
things is just
the sheer success
of California
in dominating
not just online businesses
but all sorts of
all sorts of
reproduct
businesses
where you can get scale
by using the internet
and
yeah I think
she would be
she would have been
that model wasn't
in her
in her vision
at that time
in fact
it wasn't in anyone's
vision until about
2000
yeah
this has been
such a great conversation
I really enjoyed it
Angus
thanks Aaron
Vassal State
How America Runs Britain
I don't think
it's a very left wing book
but I think you might
have some left wing conclusions
maybe you don't like
me saying that
this has been
a real pleasure
thank you so much
thank you
thank you
it's been a great pleasure
thank you
