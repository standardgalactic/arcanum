okay so i wanted to talk a little bit about how i see the broader context of the debate that
you're about to watch both in terms of a few specific things that you're going to see me
discuss with walter uh and why i think debates like this are worth doing as as absurd as as some
of the conversation can get and tying into that the biggest point i wanted to make tonight which
is about how i think leftists often respond to libertarians in ways that are unhelpful because
we take too much of their framing on board so the debate you're about to watch is a follow-up to a
written debate that played out in the pages of marion west magazine it started with an article
that i wrote uh we should have the graphic called the case for democratic socialism and by the way
we've got links to all these in the description but this is one of the things i wrote last year
that i was happiest about because what it really is is me thinking through the normative foundations
of why i care about socialism in the first place in a way that i really don't get a chance to do
in most things that i write for most other places in the article i argue that for socialism as a
fulfillment of the basic values proclaimed by the revolutions at the end of the 18th century that gave
birth to the modern world you know the american revolution the french revolution the haitian
revolution what marxists call the bourgeois democratic revolutions so in the original french those values
would be liberte galate and fraternite roughly freedom equality and social solidarity uh i do a
pretty deep dive on all three in the essay and i even recap a little bit of in the recorded debate so
i'm going to try not to repeat too much of what i say there here but i'll just say a couple of things
about it certainly the equality part is easy enough to see in an era where the gap between the super rich
and the rest of us has metastasized to a level that would have been genuinely unimaginable when our
parents were the ages that we are now i just wrote an article for unheard about how absurd i think it is
uh that we call super rich people in russia oligarchs but we don't use the same word for the ultra rich
in this country uh even though the likes of jeff bezos and elon musk have both vastly more wealth and
vastly more political power than their brother oligarchs in moscow and st petersburg i think i'm
actually going to be talking about this uh tomorrow on this is revolution uh podcast uh but uh the
you know in the beginning of that article in unheard uh i quote my good friend rob larson's book uh master in
the universe uh where he talks about uh russian um uh this uh russian billionaire uh farkad uh akhmadov
who's also all you know who is often mentioned in the press as an oligarch and fair enough uh that guy
is so rich that he has the super yacht that features a pair of helipads uh a a small submarine and a pool
that goes across nine separate decks uh according to rob's book one of arkmedov's main concerns is
making sure that his ex-wife's lawyers don't get possession uh from him of his yacht which he calls
his beast so that's a really really rich guy right you know that's just uh that's just extremely rich
um so but if arkmedov lived in america instead of russia his net worth uh would not even put him in
the 400 richest americans never mind the kind of wealth that you have with jeff bezos or elon musk
both of whom are literally hundreds of times richer than far card arkmedov right now musk has literally
been empowered by donald trump through doge to do a kind of self-inflicted version of post-soviet
shock therapy slashing and burning through our already shriveled regulatory and welfare states
i just wrote about that for jacobin but even putting aside that extreme example in general when
you have this absurd level of wealth inequality the idea that you're going to have meaningful
political qualities it's a bad joke if a worker from one of jeff bezos's warehouses calls her senator
she's gonna be lucky to have a long conversation with an intern i guarantee you that if bezos calls
he gets to talk to the senator you know so that's the equality piece of this and social solidarity i
think is also pretty obvious it's certainly vivid to me since i divide my time between rosarito and los
angeles and in la like other major cities it's often hard to even take your dog on a walk without
having to steer past people sleeping in the streets and look i'm a well socialized citizen of a
grotesquely inegalitarian society so that's exactly what i do it's what we all do but i'm inclined to
think that in a more materially equal and decent future where we didn't all have those ingrained
habits if you were out and about and you saw someone sleeping above a grade or on a park bench
uh you'd see it as a crisis as an emergency your thought would be my god what can i do to help this
person the same way it would be if you saw somebody having a heart attack in the middle of the street
you don't you know you don't think that every time in the world we live in you can't think like that
every time the world we live in when living in the streets is quite this common you lose your mind
so we end up having a society where we're very deeply alienated from a sense of community
with all of our fellow citizens and the value of solidarity or what the
late great socialist thinker ga cohen called the socialist value of community
uh can be a little bit harder to pin down than those other values that i mentioned
uh can feel a little fuzzy but i generally don't trust anyone who doesn't think this is an important
value one way to parse it which i should say is a bit different from uh what how cohen would think
about it but i think it gets to much the same point is that just having a society you know like
solidarity means having a society where we design our institutions in such a way that we treat every
single person as if they were part of the community of who we actually give a shit about that we don't
just tell them best of luck but you're on your own unless anyone misunderstand this point i'm not saying
that we we all need to take fraternity you know so so literally that you know you're every bit as
invested in every random stranger on the street as you would be in like your own literal brother or
sister having a life crisis and ending up on the streets obviously that's not psychologically
possible and even on some level even desirable uh we're all naturally and inevitably somewhat
partial to particular people who are emotionally connected to that's as it should be but you know
we all as thomas nagel put it have our own lives to live but the point is that when we come together
as a society to construct social and economic and political institutions what we want to do is create
collective institutions that really are impartial that really aren't indifferent to the fate of
anyone in that society okay so like i said i think equality and solidarity are maybe straightforward
enough what i really want to talk about here is the third one which is the one libertarians are most
eager to claim for themselves which is of course libertarian right freedom in that case for democratic
socialism essay in marion west i quote a speech that abraham lincoln gave in 1861 when he was defending the
system of free labor in the north as morally superior to slavery which is of course correct
and in the course of that he was essentially touching on concerns that people had even then
that in even in capitalist free labor there are still potentially problematic relations of domination
and exploitation so lincoln says at one point in that speech that there is no such thing as a free
man being fixed for life in the condition of a higher laborer that line makes him sound like a socialist but
he wasn't his political vision was limited to replacing slave labor in the south with capitalist wage labor
lincoln acknowledged that the capitalist system wouldn't be a system of deep and genuine freedom
if workers had to spend their whole lives as workers but he insisted that this would not happen
instead the prudent pettiless beginner in the world would work as a hired laborer for a while then
he could save up a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself work on his own account for another
while and eventually hire another beginner to help him and as much as i revere abraham lincoln if we're
honest about this the idea that everyone who's sufficiently hard working and prudent can be upwardly
mobile through the class hierarchy was already wishful thinking in 1861 even then there were only so
many lifeboats out of the working class in 2024 i hope that it's obvious to everyone that things don't work
they can't work they can't work the way that lincoln hoped um they would work for the majority of the
population just the arithmetic doesn't work out we'd all starve to death without people picking up crops
people processing food uh people driving trucks from processing plants to grocery stores people stocking
shelves at grocery stores and the rest um you know those people can all become upper middle class
professionals in any tech you know even over the course of their lives in any technologically
advanced modern economy most of this labor just is going to be done by groups of people working
together the world of small farmers and independent craftsmen isn't coming back and while class mobility
you know certainly hasn't ceased to exist in the 163 years since president lincoln's speech again certainly
does exist it's just not structurally possible for most of us to be capitalists any more than the
laws of gravity would allow the majority of cheerleaders for them moving themselves into a pyramid to be on
the top level um our choices are that most people will work communally but be ruled by capitalists who
rule their little economic fiefdoms like uh little kings and queens or that we're going to continue to
work communally but extend democracy to the half of our waking lives that most adults spend at work
through some sort of collective ownership and democratic control of the means of production and
by the way it's only half because of the results of previous worker struggles by those people that
walter block calls parasites um so after that point in the essay i spent quite a bit of time talking
about what the logistics of an economically viable form of collective ownership might look like but what i
want to emphasize right now is that whether people work together but are subject to the whims of an
unelected boss or whether they collectively and democratically run the place and collectively and
democratically decide how the products of their collective labor will be divvied up at the end of
the process is to me ultimately a question about freedom from domination that's not the libertarian
notion of freedom which is non-interference which all you know i argue in the debate is totally vacuous that
it tells us nothing about what the distribution of wealth should be um that's the sort of basic
argument that i get from people like g.a cohen and matt bruning uh i won't repeat any of it here
but what i'm talking about is a much i think deeper and more important idea of freedom it's what
political theorists call the republican theory of freedom and of course that's republican with a small r like
republican not republican like the odious political organization in the contemporary united states
and that to me is the biggest and most important disagreement that's revealed in debates like this
the disagreement about freedom and part of the purpose of doing this kind of debate is to convince
anyone who might be watching in the audience who's persuadable i mean it wouldn't be psychologically
realistic for either walter i to hope to persuade one another we're both too dug in way too deep
on you know the sort of fundamental world view questions but the goal is always to persuade
whatever chunk of the potential audience is persuadable or at the very least to plant some
seeds that might help them be persuaded down the line and sometimes people say look why do you talk
to this lunatic who says well i'm not going to tell you what he says because you know no spoilers but he
says some pretty amazing things in this debate uh that we're going to watch tonight um but you know
so the idea is oh well anybody who takes this guy seriously is just unsalvageable but i think that
this fundamentally misses the point even that even the part of the point that's about persuasion
oftentimes people who nod along with libertarian rhetoric about freedom might have second thoughts
when they see where those libertarian principles actually lead you might agree with the premise when
it's a sort of floating abstraction uh and and it's like specific meaning isn't all that clear
but then when you get to the conclusions that are logically arrived at from that premise you
get off the bus uh and really reconsider i i see tremendous value in that like look to to list some to
name somebody who you know um i don't always agree with about things that are happening you know at the
moment in the left or whatever but uh who's been on the show before uh you know i think sam cedar is
a master of this uh when he argues with libertarians like uh when he did the debate with yaron brooke from
the ayn rand institute and they were talking at the end of it about the miami condo collapse and sam said
you don't see a role for government and safety and preventing things like that and yaron said no it
should be the responsibility of the tenants to do research on the uh the company's safety practices
that's a real you know deuteronomy 30 19 moment you know i've set before you on this day life and death
uh people who might nod along with the rhetoric about freedom might realize this is a theory of
what freedom is that's actually horrifying so that's that half of the reason to do these debates
about persuasion but the other half and this is something vivek chibber and i spoke to uh you know
vivek i should say not me right like i just kind of nodded and said yeah good point but vivek spoke
to in a really eloquent way last week on the show when he was talking about the value of free speech
and how part of that value has actually nothing to do with persuading anyone it's that it keeps us
intellectually honest by making us run through our paces us get clearer and sharper in our own heads
about what we think and why by dissecting the arguments that are made against us even some pretty
absurd arguments uh that to sort of see exactly what's wrong with that you have to dig pretty deep
right you can learn a lot that way about what you think about you know values that might be lodged so
deep you never actually take them out and expose them to the sunlight and you know think about um in
that more critical and reflective way again i see tremendous value in that so in that spirit let's talk
about two really specific things that came up in this debate uh about you know that are both in some
way or another about freedom and then wrap up with a more general point so the first has to do with
so-called economic freedom rankings that are put out by the libertarian uh fraser institute in canada
i actually wrote an article about these rankings for jacobin in 2021 um but i guess walter never read
that because in his reply to me and we're in marion west uh it's called uh rejoinder to ben burgess the
uh the case for laissez-faire capitalism um walter makes heavy use of the fraser institute numbers
to try to show that the more capitalist and the less socialist uh a country is the more of all the
good things it has and the less of all the bad things but the rankings themselves are just brutally
absurd uh as i say in the debate you're about to watch but i don't have time there to elaborate
the rankings don't measure a goddamn thing except how creative think tank hacks can be
when they need to put a bunch of numbers into a blender over and over again until they get the
results that they want in fact i would argue the results themselves prove without a shadow of a doubt
that these rankings don't measure how socialist or even how social democratic a country is since the
countries in the capitalist world that have the most of the things that socialists and social
democrats advocate as far as like short-term reforms go um and the least of the things that
libertarians want places like sweden and denmark and norway actually show up as very capitalist and
there are places like haiti that have almost none of those things that show up as very economically
unfree or the way that people like walter would put it in the way that i think even a lot of fraser's
own sort of promotion of these rankings would lead us to think about it would make them more socialist
um you know haiti uh has such a crazy degree of hyper exploitation that you know as recently as
uh barack obama's first term when hillary clinton was secretary of state wikileaks cables came out and
showed that hillary clinton's state department was uh lobbying the haitian government uh at the behest of
various american companies and subcontractors in haiti against raising the minimum wage in haiti to the
princely sum of five dollars a day so again where do the laws provide more protections for organizing a
union haiti or sweden um where is there a bigger welfare state haiti or sweden come on and in fact if
you you know if you do a little actually you know i i also i think i mentioned this one in the debate but
uh when i sort of first realized how like that there's something that must have gone completely
wrong here i was reading this peter leeson paper um where he makes heavy use of uh of the fraser rankings
uh and uh in that right you know he says okay like he actually mentions uh and this completely undermines
leeson's case but he mentions it anyway without seeming to realize it that he says okay only a
few countries have become he wrote this paper in 2005 less capitalist in the last 25 years and sure
lots of bad things have happened in those places and the three countries that he mentions one of them
is ukraine right so if you take the fraser ranking seriously between 1980 and 2005 ukraine became
less capitalist right so taken literally that would mean the so the ukrainian soviet socialist republic a
member state of the ussr was more capitalist than post-privatization post-shock therapy ukraine
in 2005. i mean this is just unspeakably silly and if you start looking be you know behind the curtain
at the methodology you know which you can find a lot of on fraser's website you start to get a sense
of how they're including just wacky like uh sound money and if you really look at what they mean by
that it's like if there's a lot of inflation then they count that as like less economically free or
less capitalist and they have a justification that oh we'll see um you know like inflation uh inflation
happening uh you know sort of takes away the benefits of economic freedom so we're gonna count
places as less free if they have lots of inflation uh which which again is is just uh totally absurd
it puts the cart before the horse you know you know like an argument you would expect a libertarian
or a conservative to make is oh look all these horrible socialist policies meddling with the market
will lead to lots of inflation uh that would be a a real uh anti-socialist argument but they're not
making that right they're saying oh you know we're just gonna count the bad things happening as
evidence of less capitalism and then um and then um and then we're gonna conclude oh see less
capitalism means more bad things happen it's it's completely unserious way to uh way to argue um and
you know in the jacobin article uh you know i said like you know a lot of the things that they count
like as their general categories for analysis don't even sound like they have anything to do with
economic freedom in any sense that might be in dispute between libertarians and neoliberals on
the one hand and social democrats and socialists on the other hand um you know and even one of the
ones that does sort of sound like it would be relevant uh that's uh the it's uh legal regime and
property right or it's a rule of law and property rights i think it is uh you know i kind of took the
time in the article to uh to break down the uh the criteria uh this is the uh the a through h graphic
um and uh if you look at uh if you look at those uh the criteria there right so the things that they
count for rule of law and property rights that already sounds very suspicious oh wait a second not
just property rights but rule of law and property rights right and so it's a judicial independence b
impartial courts c protection of property rights d military interference in rule of law and politics
e integrity of the legal system f legal enforcement of contracts g regulatory costs of the sale of real
property h reliability of police and of course you don't get a lot of um you know people with like
social democratic politics going out saying you know what the problem is with america uh police are
too reliable and the legal system has too much integrity uh and there's too little military interference
and rule of law and politics right so i guess when um augusto pinochet overthrew salvador allende in
chile in 1973 then chile lost economic freedom points right you know so it was counted as less
capitalist because of military interference in rule of law and politics right item d uh the only thing
right out of um these eight criteria that even sounds relevant is c protection of property rights and i
think that's almost certainly completely irrelevant because if property rights are being protected
against nationalization then i understand how they're relevant but in any other sense right and i'd
seriously doubt that almost any of these numbers have anything to do with uh with nationalization
all right uh so and you know you see similar things uh you know when you uh when you look at other
criteria so at the time uh tibor rutar who's also been a guest on the show and uh i'm actually you know very
very fond of him in many ways as an interlocutor uh but i find him very unconvincing on this point
uh so he did a uh he did a critique of uh the jackman article on uh chris freeman's uh uh substack
uh that uh we might or might not have the graphic of but uh in any case uh yes tibor response uh so uh so
it's called uh economic freedom indexes do seem to measure how capitalist country is response to ben
burgess and um i would say i don't know if tibor you know this was a guest post on somebody else's
blog i don't know if he wrote that title but if he did it's a very misleading title right because i think
even what he shows in there uh doesn't bear this out uh he does a lot of well if you recombine the
numbers to take out certain categories and subcategories you still get broadly similar
results although even at that when he's done messing with it some of the results don't look
that similar but i think the bigger point he's just kind of assuming that okay some of the fraser
categories are surely fine right so if we just take out the specific ones i criticize then the
criticism is irrelevant which i think misses the point of the criticism what the criticism shows
is that these are really dishonest hacks right they're just putting a bunch of different unrelated
factors in the blender to get the results that they want that oh see economic freedom leads to all the
good things and you know leads away from uh you know leads away from all the bad things and so they're
they're more than happy to just stuff the bad things resulting into the blender with everything else
right so if you look at the way that things are are mixed together there i mean even if you look like
even if you look at the details of some of what he talks about in the article about uh regulation
right there's all sorts of things that are factored into the like oh how much regulation is there
you know size of government part of the fraser rankings that have absolutely nothing to do with
issues in dispute between social democrats and socialists in one camp right people who in other
words either want sort of socialistic kind of reforms to capitalism or want to maybe start there but
go further and on the other hand neoliberals and libertarians um so a lot of that in fact matt brunick
has done great stuff about this a lot of that has to do with stuff like um how hard it is to start a
business which you know if you really look into the details it's like a lot of that's like how many forms
you need to fill out stuff like that and um and so people say ah ha norway and sweden you know have uh
actually have like pretty pretty uh pretty low regulatory oversights less in some ways than the
united states it's like yeah but a lot of that's because of american federalism that there are various
like state and federal things that you have to go through uh whereas uh they you you know some of these
other countries they're being compared to they're more centralized which is in fact not something
libertarians and conservatives have typically been fans of that they you know those guys typically like
federalism you know decentralization which leads you to more forms to fill out uh with uh with more
places and again it has absolutely nothing to do with stuff like how wages are set which in you know
the nordics has often been by sectoral bargaining which uh is um you know so you have like you know big
powerful unions that bargain for wages on behalf of entire sectors of the economy right including
non-members of uh of the unions and is you know every bit as intrusive capitalist property rights in
its own way as the minimum wage stuff uh so um so i i think the idea again if you wanted to show like i
think i think if the fraser people were serious people they would say they could argue for like specific
policies leading to more of the good things less of the bad things uh and just show you like clean
numbers for that but all the numbers even within the broad categories they're mixing and matching
all sorts of subcategories in a way that just make the whole thing meaningless and lush right i don't
see any reason to take any category or subcategory these people give us seriously uh the other thing
about freedom uh that i wanted to touch on because it comes up in the debate was about um something i
referred to a minute ago that was milton friedman and uh friedrich hayek who were two of the biggest
leading lights of libertarianism in the late 20th century who both uh supported you know were
apologists to one extent or another to for the military uh right-wing dictator augusto pinochet
after he overthrew the democratically elected chilean socialist president uh salvador allende and
initiated this reign of terror against the chilean left because he couldn't defeat them electorally um
and in the debate i say this and then walter says oh uh well people say that about milton friedman he
totally ignores the hayek part uh people say that about uh milton friedman uh but you know all he did
was go down to chile and give pinochet economic advice and he went to china and gave deng Xiaoping the same
economic advice so why is it the people are using you know the chili one to prove something and not
the deng Xiaoping one it's like okay well first of all uh i actually think criticizing libertarians for
being too buddy-buddy with the authoritarian leader of china is also definitely legitimate right um you
know but also i think some relevant differences between the two situations are that deng Xiaoping hadn't
just overthrown a democratically elected government and initiated a bloody reign of terror against
supporters of that government right you know china had already been authoritarian long before he
came on the scene and particularly if you look at the letter that milton friedman wrote to pinochet
after his visit you know warmly thanking him for his hospitality and saying he was happy to see
that chili was on the right track uh i think that does go beyond just oh he'll just give economic
advice to anybody if darth vader asked him for economic advice and give it say oh you know thank you so
much you're such a great host i'm so glad to see the countries on the right track that sounds to me
like actual pinochet apologism and that's just friedman the case is actually way way better for
uh hayek uh so if um the best thing to look at here uh back in 2013 uh corey robin wrote something in
his blog called the uh the hayek pinochet connection uh and uh in there he goes into uh into the details
and he says no no this is actually um uh this is actually not at all true right that uh that you know
oh all hayek did was say pinochet was better than i and then how bad is that it's like well first of all
that would actually be very very bad if hayek was saying that the bloody military dictatorship who
overthrew uh overthrew democracy in chile uh and initiated a reign of terror against the chilean
left was better than the democratically elected president who came before him right so so you know
even if that were true that'd be bad enough that's not true right so from the robin article hayek first
visited pinochet's chile in 1977 when he was 78 amnesty international had already provided him with
ample evidence of pinochet's crimes much to his annoyance but he went anyway he met with pinochet
and other government officials who he described as educated reasonable and insightful men according
to the chilean newspaper uh el mccario hayek told reporters that he talked to pinochet about the issue
of limited democracy and road and representative government he showed he said that in his writings he
showed that unlimited democracy does not work because it creates the forces that in the end
destroy democracy he said that the head of state listened carefully and he'd asked him to provide
him with the documents uh written on this issue hayek complied with the dictator's request he had his
secretary send a draft of what eventually became uh chapter 17 a model constitution in the third volume
of hayek's law legislation and liberty the chapter includes a section on emergency powers which defends
uh dictatorships uh dictatorships when the long-run preservation of a free society is threatened um
the uh so uh cori robin notes long run is an elastic phrase and by free society hayek didn't mean
liberal democracy he has something more particular and peculiar in mind quote that the coercive powers of
government are restricted to the enforcement of universal rules of just conduct and cannot be used for
for the achievement of particular purposes that phrase robin notes is doing a lot of the work
here hayek believed for example that the effort to secure a specific distribution of wealth constituted
uh the pursuit of a particular purposes so the threats to a free society might not simply come from
international civil war nor they must they be imminent in other words it's fine to have you know this is me not
queer robin uh it's fine to uh to have uh a uh temporary dictatorship uh in order to um in order to prevent
socialists from violating capitalist property rights because what they really mean when they talk about
freedom is capitalist property rights right so but what what is that right what we're talking about we
talk about capitalist property rights right property rights and the means of production is the freedom
of particular sort of miniature economic dictators to run their little miniature kingdoms as they
please right i mean this is the this is the freedom of a child who has trapped a bug in a jar uh to do
whatever he wants to with the bug except for in this analogy the bug is uh the working class majority of
society it's an absurd account of freedom and the reason i'm really emphasizing this point and this is the
last thing i want to say here uh is that this notion of of what freedom is right fundamentally does not
track what ordinary people care about when they think about freedom right and i think this goes from
everything from the sort of long-term goals about workers control the means of production that would
you know sort of end this domination of the majority of society by wealthy minority to very short-term
issues like uh are you going to stay in a job you hate right for fear of losing your health insurance
or can you take a year off to write that novel right uh these are the kinds of issues that impact how
free people are and i think there's a bad habit by some on the left to sort of seed the freedom framing to
the libertarians and if anything right to say oh those guys care too much about freedom as opposed
to these other values that that's where they go wrong that um that they have a sort of selfish
obsession with their own rights as opposed to the greater good and i think that's exactly exactly the
wrong way to argue with them right so i just saw this quote from naomi klein who's somebody who does
does good work but you know i think people know i have some disagreements with her um but somebody
quoted this in the that panel i was on that jason and i were on at uc irvine the other day uh where
klein is talking about um economic shock therapy and she says the neoliberals were carried it out she
accuses them of being utopians were obsessed with this long-term vision of economic freedom and said oh
we don't need grandiose visions of freedom or something like that right i think this is exactly the wrong way
to argue against neoliberalism we need to argue against this stuff on the basis of a much more
expansive view of human freedom as opposed to the privatized petty tyrannies that are being defended
