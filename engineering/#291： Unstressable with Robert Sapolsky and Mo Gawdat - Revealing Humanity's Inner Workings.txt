welcome back everyone uh my guest today uh is uh one of those that i call a sensei in my heart
even though i have never met them in person dr robert sapolsky is definitely one of my big
teachers robert is a neuroscientist he's a primatologist with countless numbers of books i
actually don't even know if i read all of them but i can always tell you that the ones i read i
absolutely love of course behave determined why zebras don't get ulcers fabulous piece of work
a primates memoir the trouble with testosterone i loved that idea so many of them truly truly
enlightening robert at at the bottom of my heart is the person that basically tells us how biology
makes you the human that you are so so that link between biology and and our behavior i don't think
has ever been summarized as well as it has been by my guest today dr robert sapolsky this is part of
our mini series on stress in preparation for unstressable to be released in the us 30th of
april and in international english in the uk on the 9th of may unstressable is a big effort on my side to
take a million people out of stress every year as part of the one billion happy mission uh so please
do give it a chance go do your pre-orders if you want if you do pre-order keep your pre-order
uh receipt go to unstressable.com and come to our uh opening seminar uh on 28th of april uh with no
further ado i have been looking for this for ever robert as i as i told you before we started the best
thing about having a podcast is those moments where you meet your heroes so thank you for being here
well thank you for having me on this is a very nice way to start off the morning so
much appreciated it is definitely a very good way for me to start uh you know next week so that's uh
that's how how important this is for me so robert i i'd like to start with um where where i where i
you know was wishing to to include you in this series was to start with the biology of stress and how
how stress actually works within um you know humans from a biological point of view stress seems to be
this very uh un understood thing for people who are feeling stressed it seems so unpredictable
but if we do if we truly understand the biology it's a lot more predictable than we think it is so
maybe start us there and then we we flow to the more interesting sides of it well i guess for me
the most critical thing in terms of making sense of humans and stress and stress-related disease
is of course just how bizarre of a species we are uh evolutionarily something i'm always struck by
is you know you go back a hundred million years and there was some sunny afternoon somewhere where some
tiny dinosaur was being chased by a predatory one and the little one was running for its life and the
big one was running for its meal and you know highly stressed moment and what astonishes me is the
certainty with which we know that both of those dinosaurs were secreting the exact same stress hormone
that we're still doing these days um or something very close structurally to it something like
cortisol or hydrocortisone um the fact that the stress response is this ancient piece of wiring in us
it's like the basic building blocks the same in us vertebrates mammals reptiles fish amphibians birds so
everybody out there has roughly the same one and it's been around forever and it's always solving the same
problem which is some emergency where you are running for your life and everything comes down to what
happens in the next two minutes and what did we evolve we evolved the capacity as smart primates
to secrete it in response to psychological stress and chronic psychological stress and thinking about
some horror going on on the other side of the planet
and we're using it in a way it didn't evolve for and that's where we get into trouble and and and we
call that smart i mean it's quite interesting when you really think about it because you know every every
other species in in you know on this planet would normally stress as an an escape mechanism a survival
mechanism right to a clear and present danger we we tend to to create threats uh that are not even
sensed by the amygdala if i understand that correctly they're really generated in the prefrontal cortex and
then affecting our stress response which is not smart at all when you really think about it no and would
make no sense at all to some other species i mean if you sit down a hippo and try to describe your fears
about the planet warming or whatever and that's causing you to secrete this particular stress hormone
it would make no sense at all or the fact that you're doing it when you're stuck in traffic or when
you're thinking about mortality or when you're any such psychologically it is just unprecedented in the
history of like animals running around on this planet to be smart enough to be able to make yourself
sick just by thinking or feeling or remembering so i i quoted you in the book actually my co-author alice
quoted you in the book uh you know uh from uh why zebras don't get ulcers uh and the idea that that
animals will just suspend the stress response as soon as the threat is gone right they'll shake their
bodies and they're done right uh we we keep we keep it going we keep we even increase it a little we add a
bit of drama and a bit of you know our previous trauma and as as you beautifully stated in so much
of your work we may even go back genetically to things that happened tens of thousands of years
ago and include that in our genetic makeup and and basically just create a massive problem out of
nothing that exists in the current moment at all yeah exactly in a way that is just bizarre and
unprecedented again my book i wrote about stress and why zebras don't get ulcers uh metaphor but
zebras is just your prototypical beast running around in the grasslands and such and it's sitting
there eating grass minding its own business a lion suddenly leaps out the zebra runs for its life like
crazy has a mass massive stress response and good luck for the zebra escapes and the lion gives up and
disappears and you go look at the zebra two minutes later and clearly the only thing in its brain at that
point is what to make of this blade of grass versus that blade of grass just it's gone it's gone the the
capacity for just anticipatory stress and especially stress anticipatory stress responses for things
that never really happen um yeah that's where our problems come from i mean it seems simple like
when you did think about it logically yeah if it hasn't happened i don't need to stress about it yet
but we're so bad at that so teach us how do we change this well we're very very smart and showing
where we could get into trouble is our smartness is not just purely cognitive it has big emotional
contents to it and we're the only species out there that could read a book and when the the protagonist dies
at the end you're devastated you're you're emotionally overwrought you could sit there and you could watch
a frightening movie and you can have a massive stress response despite the fact that you're sitting there
and wait those really are not they don't exist those are fictional characters those are actors playing them
they're computer-generated images you're getting upset about pixels it's wild that we're capable of doing
that um and it's wild that we can thus have a stress response as abstract as reading about something
that's happening to refugees on the other side of the planet and it's wild that as a species we can be smart enough
that we send a drone off and we kill somebody whose face we have never seen we have this capacity to
abstract our emotions over space and time like nothing else out there for better or worse
how do we stop that we're just another primate in some ways we've got the same blueprint going on in
our heads for how we feel empathy but if you're a baboon out in the savannah in east africa the empathy you
feel is maybe for a member of your group who's having a hard day um it depends on who they are
and whether you're friends with them and what's in it for you and that sort of thing and it's a very
good thing that we instead can feel empathy for somebody on the other side of the planet or somebody
whose life experiences are completely different from and we're able to see the commonality and we're able
to walk a mile in their shoes and that some of the time that enormous capacity to feel somebody else's
pain um thank god we're smart enough as a species to do that that could be a very good thing when it's
something we have no control over when it's something that's purely in our heads when it's something
that's driven by you know emotional needs on our part that are purely selfish or heartless or some
such thing you know then you're having emotional responses that are nothing but humans at their
worst what can we do you know in terms of stress management tell the difference between what you can
control and what you can't tell the difference between information about the world around you
that is actually actually useful rather than merely stress-inducing um tell the difference between
real sources of social support and people who turn out to be just acquaintances or worse than that you
know and recognize that all of those are difficult slow processes to get good at a lot of people will
say how how can i be calm when um when there is so much injustice in the world when there is a child
uh you know that fell in a well all the way in morocco but it's still a child anyway right i need to be
informed of that stuff mo i need to be you know aware of it i need to find my humanity and my heart
in relating to it well it's wonderful if that's the only way you could do that um it's counterproductive
if it leaves you in an ulcerated mess of anxiety depression things of that sort because those tend to
be disorders of incapacitation um it's not productive if the empathy you feel for somebody else is so
painful that all you can think about is how to reduce your own pain in that circumstance yeah
which empathy is not a virtue in and of itself empathy is a wonderful thing only insofar as it
moves you to act compassionately and if instead it causes you to flee this is not a very good thing i love
these studies that have shown the following okay so you're looking at somebody in trouble somebody in
pain somebody whatever and you were feeling empathy for them and the question becomes is this a predictor
of you're going to actually be able to reach out and help them or is it going to become too painful
for you and you have to pretend it's somebody else's job and oh i couldn't make a difference anyway
and there's two ways of predicting it on two very different levels of getting at how our brains work
that ultimately wind up being the exact same thing on the psychological level do you sit there and say
oh my god what if that were happening to me that would be so awful that's a predictor that's going to
get so painful for you that you're going to decide i need to look away on the other hand if you're sitting
there saying oh my god imagine how painful it is for that person experiencing it that's a predictor of
having enough detachment that you could actually act compassionately so interesting yes and then
physiologically it's the exact same thing you sit there and you look at this other person in pain
and if you have a massive increase in your heart rate and your blood pressure
that's a predictor that it's all going to be much too much and you've got too much of a stress response
and the pain you need to deal with at that point is the pain you were feeling if you could sit there
and physiologically be a little bit detached that's the predictor that you're going to be able to work
on their pain rather than your own this ability to get a little bit of distance
it's you know every time you have a pediatrician that could give a child a vaccine and the child is
screaming when pain over it and all of that and the pediatrician nonetheless has developed the skills
of detachment to know i'm actually saving this child's life by doing this you're seeing the principle
in action so the the this this is so eye-opening to be honest because in the last few you know the
last many months actually probably over two years now because of the nature of my work all over the
world uh you know you see that the current events in the world are leading to massive massive um
engagements on social media and you know anger and uh and comments and you know people believing
that if you're not commenting on one side then you're on the other side and so on and so forth which
interestingly i i tended to always tell people that which i think aligns with your first comment that
you know a comment you know is only valuable if it makes a difference and accordingly empathy should
lead you to engage in ways that make a difference but you're also but when when you're saying it now
i've actually noticed that a lot of the shouting is not about the victims a lot of the shouting is about
the screamer exactly so it's it's basically i am angry that this is happening in the world it is an
issue for me it's not that i have an empathy for the victim i am directing my anger at the world
because because i because it serves me to to to vent that anger right uh what you're saying is the
predictor is i am actively engaged to alleviate the suffering of the victim that's the kind of empathy
that we're looking for yeah and what that often requires is for us to do something that's very
difficult in terms of feeling empathy what are the easiest circumstances for somebody to feel empathy
and act compassionately if it's for somebody who is nearby psychologically or literally somebody who
seems like a me seems like a me seems like an us somebody who you can identify with and somebody
whose troubles is something you could imagine something that is comprehensible to you and thus we face our
toughest challenges which is to feel empathy for somebody who is very distant in some form or other
psychologically and way different than us and people who count as someone like me and who has a problem
that is way different from anything you've ever had to deal with and what we have here is a prescription
for why it is so much easier to feel the pains of in group members for people who count as an us
rather than a them and that's where the biggest challenge is because the world is full of people
where we have to work very hard to try to imagine the world from their perspective i've waited to meet
you for a long time so let me tell you why i find your work so intriguing because i often respond the first
time i hear some of your extreme comments with a no in my mind i go like no no that that doesn't make sense
like i i don't like this right or i don't want to align with this and then you listen to it again and
then you go like but there is so much almost brutal truth in it you know it's like i i feel that in
your work you're like i don't care how it's going to make you feel it's just what the science says
really right and and so you know you might as well take it from me get angry if you want but it is what
it is right and and when you when it when you when you remember your ted talks around five six years ago
uh the first one uh yeah it was so intriguing i don't recall it exactly now because it was a long
time ago but it was i think it was watched 20 million times or so and and you start to address violence
and and the idea that somehow for some of us some violence is good and some violence is horrible okay
and and it's the same person and you know you you you'd you'd it's almost like what you see in the
movies when when the bad guy is killed you're happy when the good guy is killed you're upset right or
you know you sort of almost at the end of the movie you want the bad guy to suffer before he dies
right and and that's so inhuman in an interesting way but it speaks to the
uh tricks that our biology play on us would you would you be would you care to mention that a little
bit well it's part of our enormous vast complexity um in that humans there's this paradoxical thing
about us without question we are the most miserably violent species on this planet and it's
horrifying and without question we are the most compassionate empathic cooperative altruistic
species on this planet and often it's the same person who's capable of those extremes often it's
the same behavior at the same time and it's in the eye of the beholder we have this enormous human
capacity to do good in some settings and bad in others and what is challenging for me is the
similarities underneath when we're looking at us at our best and at our worst we have moments where we
can act with strong emotions to stop someone from doing what they're doing and in one setting that's
an absolutely appalling act and in another setting it's a greatly humanitarian one and what that tells
us is for example we don't hate violence we hate the wrong kind of violence when it's the right kind we
love it we leap up we're excited we pay money to see it in a movie we give out medals for the person who
who has done it and saved innocent people or whatever and in the same way we approve of love
we don't do it in all cases because when it's the wrong kind we are appalled when it is someone who
loves the wrong person who brings them tremendous pain when there's someone who loves inflicting pain
we don't uniformly hate hatred and we don't uniformly love love because they're context dependent
damn we've got complicated brains going on and you and you go that layer deeper and suddenly
all of the all of the romantics realize that it's not you know uh one size fits all and all of the
you know of the violent ones realize it's not the one size fits all but i have to say the first time
i heard you say this it really took me a very long time because i i hate violence a lot more than i like
it i mean uh when when you're when you're speaking now you you always hit that thing that i cannot
disagree with right so you know if if someone saves an innocent life by using violence well i'm gonna have
to i'm gonna have to approve of that actually celebrate that right but but but i tend to to say
if we ever revert to violence it has to be the very very lost resource right however having said that
i think i think the reality of the matter is that the species in general i think since the gladiator
of years has has been quite celebratory of violence in in so many ways which again gets me back to the
to the biology right like why are we like that what why do humans approve of what empathetically they
wouldn't want for themselves because our capacity for empathy um comes with fine print comes with
conditions as to who we could feel before here's here's another study that i love showing you know
just how terrible things can be with us as a species um you take somebody there's a part of the brain
called the anterior cingulate cortex um and it's got a lot to do with empathy it's the part of the
brain you you put somebody in a brain scanner and you poke their finger with a pin and a whole bunch
of areas and your brain activate and one area is saying that's my finger that's not my toe and another
area is saying that's a sharp pain that's not an abrasive pain and an area like the anterior cingulate
is saying oh what does that pain mean to me what's the interpretation i'm giving to it and if it's a
very aversive interpretation it will activate it's i don't like this i am made to feel stressed unhappy
unsafe whatever okay so now you put somebody in a brain scanner and you don't poke their finger with a
pin make them watch their loved one have their finger poked with a pin and the part of the brain that says
oh that's your finger not your toe it doesn't activate because it's not your finger and it's not
your toe and it doesn't say it's not a sharp pain it's not it's not telling you anything like that
but the anterior cingulate activates because it's the part of the brain where you're also feeling
somebody else's pain wow that's there's neurons there that could not tell the difference between
your pain and somebody else's but now you look at a study where you put somebody in a brain scanner
and they're looking at a little film clip and they see somebody's hand and they're seeing a needle
poked into the hand and there's the needle goes in you just squinted you just exactly what oh my god i
can't even look at that and all of that and then you look at the experiment and if the hand has a skin
color that is not your own on the average the anterior cingulate doesn't activate as much in
your average test subject you don't feel their pain as much jeez you make the skin color purple
and it has no effect because you're saying oh for some reason yeah they're messing around with like
the computer graphics or something here but oh my god that would hurt so much but no make it realistic
and it depends on whose pain whose face whose skin whose circumstance and that's the thing with us
on a certain you know neurobiological level it's the most straightforward thing in the world ooh tell
me what the brain is doing when you pull the trigger and i can tell you the exact neurobiology of the
command going to these muscles calling causing it to what can contrast rather than extend or whatever
and it's it's always the same but if you're pulling that trigger doing something appalling or if you're
pulling that trigger doing something suicidally brave to draw fire on yourself to save a bunch of
other it's the exact same you know male and act it's the same and it's such different if you move
your hand to put it on top of somebody else's that could be a moment of great empathy and compassion
that could be a moment of enormous betrayal of a loved one and it's all context wow it's not the
it's not the action it's the meaning of the action and boy is that complicated when it comes to us us
humans at the end of the day though it is uh it's anterior cingulate that is basically telling me i i
can relate to another human and that also could be uh which i i don't remember which book you mentioned
that in uh can be altered with stress so if if two minutes before i was feeling stressed because i was
in the traffic jam i would actually have less uh empathy to another human's pain because of my stress
exactly which is thoroughly discouraging and totally familiar yeah when the world is horribly stressful
um your your sort of landscape your horizon as to who counts as someone whose pain you feel becomes
very local and very narrow and very parochial and very built around people who look like me or pray like
me or love like me or eat foods like me or or any such thing like that it becomes very very local and
what's research has shown sort of my lab about a decade ago we did a collaboration showing with this
that part of what goes on during stress when you feel less of a capacity for empathy is this class of
stress hormones cortisol glucocorticoids are working in the brain and part of it involves the anterior
cingulate and makes it more selfish and more focused on its own needs and you know translating out into
neurobiology it makes neurons they're less responsive to stimuli to somebody else's pain it makes the
threshold much much higher stress does that stress makes some people at their best and i think what we've
seen you know flagrantly since the start of the pandemic is it brings out the worst in an awful lot of
people and fear does that and anxiety and pain and insecurity and uncertainty and a sense of helplessness and
hopelessness it brings out the best in some of us but it does awful things to an awful lot of people and that's the
the neurobiology about why a brain that is very very stressed is a brain that has a whole lot of
trouble feeling the pain of somebody who counts as a them rather than as an us do you think this is from
an evolutionary biology point of view like sort of we we survived because of our tribal come together
somehow so i need to be closer i need to care more about those who are like me and i need to protect
them more and so on but those who are further away you know they could be the enemy or at least not
related to my survival yes but in such an interesting way when it gets to us okay this is this is like the
most depressing literature out there take volunteers you put them in a brain scanner once again it always
seems like these depressing stories the first sentence is always you put somebody in a brain
scanner so you got somebody in there and you're flashing up pictures of faces and you flash up the
face of somebody of a different race and in about 75 of people there's activation of the amygdala
the amygdala part of the brain having to do with fear and anxiety and aggression okay that's awful
what's even more awful is the amygdala activates in under one hundredth of a second in a fraction of a
second thought even begins before you even consciously know what you were looking at your visual processing
system has a shortcut that sends information to the amygdala the amygdala knows what you were
looking at if it's an emotionally arousing thing it knows it before you were even consciously aware of
it by about a half second or so oh my god that's the most depressing thing on earth because it activates
in response to the face of somebody who's at them oh my are we are we innately wired for racism for
example and the answer to that is that's the craziest thing on earth because you take a non-human
primate and you show them a picture of the face of them somebody from an out grouper and their amygdala
activates you show this has been around for millions and millions of years and races in so far as that's
even like a scientifically valid concept races are only about 30 000 and 40 000 years old or so like
nobody ever used to encounter somebody who looked very different from them we're hardwired to divide
the world between us and them but it's really really easy to manipulate us as to who counts as in us
and who counts as of them and this is shown in the follow-up studies now you take somebody you put them
in a brain scanner and you get somebody who is a sports fanatic they're a soccer fan and they have
their home team their soccer team that they would kill for and they would die for and they're a fan
of that team and all of that and there's the soccer team that's the hated enemy and the rival
and all of that and now you're flashing up faces once again for this person in the brain scanner
and each one of these faces is wearing a cap either with the logo of your home team or the logo of the
hated enemy team and now your amygdala is responding to is responding to the hat they're wearing the
amygdala doesn't care about skin color who is an us and who is it them it has changed in a fraction of a
second we're constantly changing our categories with that so is very very innate in us i think
exactly as you say along the lines of you know millions of years ago as to divide the world into
us into them and to not like the thems but who counts as of them we could change in a second's notice
with symbolic stuff with things like that oh my god i mean but what i would do to shadow you for
a day what what how do you come up with those experiments well no i i did not do those experiments
i i i mostly have just done things to rats and and monkeys and i have not done a whole lot to actual
humans but no this is reading astonishingly good work by lots and lots of colleagues out there but
they're amazing ones because they show but but then look at look at like the world around us somebody
calls you up on the phone and says hi i'm on the other side of the world and a kid has just fallen in a
river and i'm thinking about jumping and to save them but if i do that like i've got my airplane
ticket back home this is like ancient times where like it was actual piece of paper i've got my airplane
if i jump in the river it's going to disintegrate and it's going to be ruined and i'm going to need
money to buy a new plane ticket will you give me the money for that and you'll say oh you know that's
kind of scary yeah i i i would love to but here's the reason why yet if you were standing there in
that same moment on the edge of that river and you saw this kid whose face you have never seen before
and they've fallen in there and everyone's saying oh my god and there's a decent chance that you would
be the person who jumps into the river to save the child wait a second you were unwilling to like pay
for a plane ticket on the other side of the planet to in effect save this child's life but if it's
right there in front of you this child feels like you're and it's context it's this crazy sort of
thing where in the moment whose pain just rips us to shreds and very enormously and you'll never see
that child again and you would never see them before and that child may have belief systems that
are utterly alien to you but for that split second and for that split second the empathy overrides all
of that if you're one of the ones who has that capacity to do that and it depends on who you are and
who they are and if you've gotten a good night's sleep and how you were raised and if you were
raised the hate and yeah and it's very dependent on context i mean i can't help but think that this
is so magnified by our modern world though i mean when you really think about the idea of the hats and
how who you define as your tribe and who's the enemy uh and and look at social media and how social
media divides us into those you know if you look at if you look at that idea of the distant uh uh um
you know events in the world even if they're affecting many but they're not within your domain
or you within your neighborhood uh and and how you would feel differently about them and how mainstream
media is is playing that card in a in a very interesting way and and and you have to you have to
recognize how much more stressed we become because of the way the modern world is designed because of
our our connection to those kinds of magnifiers that are playing to our weaknesses our weaknesses that
sometimes have the potential to bring out wonderful things in us but our weaknesses that very readily can
do exactly the opposite and you know you've you you mentioned the word before tribalism which is
such an apt appropriate world for making sense of so much of what we're about um as a primate as a
ape as a human thing and often because of how complex we are um the signals we're building ourselves
around as to who counts as an us into them is remarkably arbitrary i mean this you can look okay
here's two people one of them is wearing a big cowboy hat and the other one is wearing a sari
and merely by looking at that you can tell one of them thinks that cows are good for eating and one of
them think that cows are good for worshiping yeah you can tell which one or you look at two men and merely
by the type of hat they're wearing you can tell who they think should be able to control access to the
wailing wall and the temple mount in jerusalem whether it should be someone muslim or someone jew
just by the hat just by the way they trim their beard like whoa we're doing some very interesting
stuff there in terms of how we could signal to strangers wow i've never met that person before
but i know i'm willing to kill for them or i'm willing to die for them because they've got the
same ideology or theology and i can tell just by one because they look like they've got the same they
you don't even know that they do yeah exactly because you can go on that showing how abstractive wow we're
a species that's willing to kill over the color of a flag like whose flag are you waving what gang
are you wearing the t-shirt colors of what you know any of those things and that is a very complicated
species that's going on there and it is very very very hard to sit somebody down and say hey you're
you're willing to kill that person because of their ideology or theology or all of that but you
want to know something amazing if you happen to have been born there you would think like one of
them you would be willing to kill one of your folks now you'd be a different it is totally arbitrary
that you have these beliefs because you would be a completely different and you would really think
and no no no but this is what makes sense to me people have a very very hard time understanding
just how arbitrary their hatreds and their loves and their loyalties and their obediences and their
things of that sort how arbitrary it is and yet we feel it our brains process it with an intensity
that it's unimaginable to us that have you could easily have been a very different person you didn't
pick that womb that you spent nine months in you didn't pick that mother you didn't pick that culture
you were born in and you would have been a very different person and the thing you're willing to
kill for or die for now would be incomprehensible to the same you if things had gone a little bit
differently for you yeah i want to i want to come to determinism but uh but i i'd like to keep that
a minute more because i think that's a very interesting part of the conversation uh you mentioned uh
you know cortisol and all of how how those hormones work on us and and i and i heard you
speak of dopamine once in a way that was so eye-opening once again you know dopamine being the
the reward hormone uh and uh and uh you know the idea that we we we chase that reward but that
dopamine is not actually triggered upon the reward would you would you so kindly explain that i thought
that was so eye-opening it's eye-opening and it explains so much of the misery on this planet
okay dopamine um it's usually functioning as a neurotransmitter but it is a hormone some of the time
dopamine it's about reward it's about pleasure cocaine works on the dopamine system all that's
what people used to know and then people figured out as you were saying dopamine usually it's not about
reward or pleasure it's about the anticipation of it you get somebody and you have trained them to do
some task they get a little signal saying okay this task has begun and if you press a lever 10 times now
you're going to get a reward and what everybody used to think in the past is when you get the reward
that's when the dopamine gets released from reward centers in your brain and what turns out instead is
whether you are a human or a monkey or a rat or whatever when do you get the dopamine when the
signal comes on saying it's one of these moments if you press the lever now you're going to get a reward
as soon as you realize it's one of those moments that's when the dopamine comes you're sitting there
and you're saying this is going to be fantastic this is great i know how to press levers i know exactly
how to do this sort of thing i'm on top of it this is going to be great it's about anticipation
it's about the motivation you then feel to press the lever and all of that it's that's what it's about
okay so that's great it's about the pursuit of pleasure rather than the pleasure itself it's about
the anticipation and we could do really amazing things as humans in terms of how much we can keep
dopamine going in anticipation it's what causes us to function along those lines i wanted to interrupt
because you you mentioned a quote at the time that was so uh profound you said it wasn't the pursuit
of happiness it's the happiness of the pursuit and that's exactly it yes yeah we're we're looking we're
looking for when when we're under the in the influence of dopamine if i could call it the
influence what you're doing is you're just it's not even about getting the thing that makes you feel
high it's about anticipating that you're going to get it yep and sometimes that's great because that
makes you work hard your entire life to bring about some massive project or whatever and sometimes it's
about things that are never going to happen sometimes we could do stuff that no other species
can we can have dopamine released in part of our brain for anticipation and motivation for entire
lifetime because we think there's going to be an amazing reward of some kind after we die what the
after life is what like that could be the version of it so that's one version of how bizarre it is
but i think the even more fundamental strange thing we do with dopamine is you know you look at a
chimpanzee and what counts as the sort of things it could anticipate maybe food or sex or safety or
getting to beat up somebody they're feeling vengeance about it that's a pretty small list of things that
could be a source of pleasure or anticipatory pleasure and what do we have as humans we can feel
anticipatory pleasure about food and sex and survival and all of that but we can we can feel that way
over reading poetry we can have a sense of pleasure over smelling a flower over solving a math problem if
you're the right type of crazy human you know any i am that guy for sure yes exactly like whoa we're a
species where you can have like a massive release of dopamine when you smell the first flowers of spring
and then 20 minutes later a massive release of dopamine because of an orgasm and the amazing is you
release the same amount of dopamine a lot in both cases whoa we're a species where we have a range of
a capacity of pleasure that's just thousand fold bigger than any other species out there how do we have
a brain that could do that the only way is some of the time the dopamine system going from zero to a
hundred a hundred a hundred is hearing a good line of poetry or solving a coding problem and some of the
time going from zero to a hundred is winning the lottery or whatever you have to constantly be resetting
the gain on your system correct on your dopamine system yeah and it needs to be able to an instant say
okay right now we're doing zero to a hundred for the smell of flowers oh no right now instead we're doing zero
to a hundred for doing a stock option uh an ipo or whatever and you're gonna and it needs to be able
to reset it needs to be able to habituate very quickly and out of that comes what i think is one of
like the deepest sources of human misery which is you get some amazing reward from out of nowhere
yesterday and it's wonderful you've got a massive release of dopamine and today the same reward
is going to feel like what you're entitled to yeah and tomorrow it's going to feel like it's not enough
because your system is constantly so we're always hungry and the more we eat the hungrier we get and
the more we want and the more we want because we're constantly saying oh now it's this big of a gain on
the system we have going from zero to a hundred it's the fact that we as humans can do dopamine for
both poetry and eating a meal when you're desperately hungry or if you're a certain type of human giving
food to somebody who's desperately hungry it's that range that what was amazing yesterday is what we feel
like we deserve today and it's not going to be good enough tomorrow and accordingly of course being aware
of that i think is the is the whole idea it's it's not clicking on amazon to buy a new thing every
minute to get yourself a little kick it's actually falling in love with the thing that you have or
actually finding the thing that would really give you joy before you click right and and it is it is
quite a challenge for most of us who are trained by the modern world to just want more and more and more and
we're a very vulnerable species because people who are very smart and very well trained understand
exactly how to make you feel that way for whatever the next new thing is whether it's a new car or a
new spouse or a new name or a new persona or a new whatever there there's a very well understood science
for making us feel hungrier and less satisfied with whatever it is we have right now the bit of
your work of last year uh indetermined that i'm still really struggling with to be honest
is that from an a biological point of view your view is that we have very little choice if any choice at
all like you know the the the the reason i like your work so much is not something that i had any
choice in you know the way i was raised the the you know the events that happened that conditioned me
the way my parents were before i was even born and so on determined where i am as a human which
i you know i i i have to say mathematically is very accurate right uh but but at the same time
i sort of recall times in my life where i really resisted my nature and and i really tried to you
know to do what i'm not biologically designed to do so you know indetermined uh you you're saying we
don't even have that which i think is a bit uh a bit disappointing that i have no i have no control
on what i choose at all well i i should emphasize like the the book is called determined the science
of life without free will and i don't think there's any free will whatsoever and my argument is when you
look at where a behavior comes from it's from your neurons that did something half a second ago but
it's also from the environmental stimuli in the last three minutes that triggered those neurons and
it's your hormone levels from this morning and it's whether you had this trauma or this wonderful
event a year ago and it's your childhood and your fetal life and your genes and the culture and all of
that and my argument of there being no free will is when you look at how all those pieces of
biology over which you had no control interacting with environment over which you had no control
there's no place in there to put in this sense of free will of a sense of there's a me that's
independent of all of that biological and environmental history okay so give me an example of a time where
you acted against your nature uh when my daughter was five years old and i was a very serious business
executive and you know she comes into my uh office at you know 10 a.m in the morning jumping up and
down on a saturday saying papa you know we're going mama said we're going to this place we're gonna
have popcorn and we're gonna have cotton candy and can we please pass by that ice cream place and i looked
at her and i said and i one of the determining moments of my life honestly you know being driven by all
of the conditioning i've had until that moment i looked at her and i said can we please be serious
for a moment okay i was busy with my email right and she burst crying she burst crying to the point
that i literally could see with my own eyes how my little daughter's heart broke and and i and that
moment maybe it's part of my conditioning again maybe it was determined but that moment flipped me upside down
changed my life i remember i closed my door and i started crying and i said i never want to be that
person again and i i started to act against my nature right in a very you know um attentive way a very
you know this a decision that i made to change right so i i agree with you that all of my life was
leading me to that moment but my daughter's action changed my behavior does that count as no free will
i i i i i want to tell myself i i made a choice to not break my daughter's heart again which is
heartbreaking hearing that story of the the the the pain that we can cause inadvertently by how much our
own hungers drive us yeah but no that's completely compatible with how nonetheless there was no free will
there for a very simple reason there's lots of other people who would have been sitting there other
silicon valley overachievers who having the exact same experience would have said i'm not kidding i
need to get some work done go go ask your mother and you would sit there afterward and say i'm trying
i've i told my partner that i need to get some work done why can't they sort of this or that or why oh my god
this this this child yeah yeah i guess i was like that but so irritating and and they would have a
completely different response how did you become the sort of person where that would be one of the
moments that would define your life it was not by chance because a zillion other people could have
been in that exact same moment and maybe they would have just gone back to work or maybe they would have
felt badly for a few minutes or maybe how did you become the sort of person where that was a
transformational moment in your life that was not by chance you know two people go to see a movie
some inspirational movie and one of them comes out of there changed by the experience they come out and
they choose to do something different they say oh my god i'm going to devote the rest of my life to this
like good cause i'm going to go give away all my money to doctors without borders and somebody else
comes in and sees the exact same movie and they're changed by it they come out and they choose to do
something different they say oh my god that was the most emotionally manipulative movie i've ever seen
in my life i hated that movie i am going to go and demand to get my money back right now
whoa same movie same moment same because life had made them into different people who experienced that
moment in that way and it is not by chance that even amid all the ways in which you were viewing the
world as a very different place up to that moment that that moment how did you become the sort of person
so that moment was a moment for you because it wouldn't have been for lots of other people
so i i'm i'm with you on that i mean remember my my the scientific mind of of the half of me
will will know that very well in physics right so in physics uh in classical physics we always assume
that if we knew every the location of every particle in the universe and its momentum and its speed and
it's you know mass and so on and so forth we can determine the next moment of the universe with
high accuracy right everything is just following the laws of physics basically those particles some
of them are in my eyeballs and some of them are in a tree but you know we know that the eyeball is going
to hit the tree it's you know it's very clear having said that there are those moments where
something changes and and i i'm asking the question because it relates to the bigger picture of our world
but but let's say at the micro level first you know because are we telling people look you are who
you are there's absolutely no no way you can influence that so if you're a depressive you're
going to end up being depressed the whole rest of your life if you're you know as a person who has
accepted the stress in their life you're going to be stressed for the rest of your life where where
is our agency in changing our own life well we don't have it but what we have is a capacity to act upon
our knowledge you've got somebody who's paying attention to this podcast and hearing that incredibly
moving story of yours and that may trigger their moment that may cause them to sit there and say oh my
god i once had a moment like that where a loved one and i didn't do that i just got irritated and
turned away and you by telling that story could have caused that moment in someone else let's turn that
into neurobiology you by telling that story you by having become the person you are so that in that
moment you told that story you by doing changed the brain of somebody else they didn't show free will
that changes and because we're a species that can have a metal level of knowledge about it
when they think about that and when they're transformed by this but tonight when they go to
bed they're thinking you know that's great but maybe i really shouldn't quit my job and devote the
rest of my life to this they have now figured out let me think again about how i felt when i heard
that story let me pull up some other examples in my mind of things where i could now have the same
emotional response let me go read a book tomorrow that will reaffirm that in me even more so how did
you become the sort of person who would have a respect for let me reflect on what happened to me today
how would you become the sort of person who would have respect for and a capacity for going out and
getting more experiences now that will reaffirm that yeah it is it's so interesting when you because i i
i sort of get it in my scientific mind i'm just not able to put it in word it's that every single
collision of two particles in physics will trigger a slightly different trajectory that you can capitalize on
right and and basically reconfigure your mind in the case of neuro neuroscience you can you can take
that one moment and and that one moment was not within your free will it just happened to you and
then you can choose to take that and reconfigure your entire life with a lot of neuroplasticity over
time to get to the right place um the the reason i ask this question and and i know by the way i with
with a ton of respect robert what i normally do is i make the most amazing conversations i have on that
podcast shorter because i encourage my listeners to go back and listen to them again so as much as i
would like to speak to you for six more hours i'd i'd i'd ask i'd ask your permission to perhaps maybe
grant me another opportunity to invite you and have another conversation and one more question and
we close this one um one of the things that really really really uh got to me is that if we take our
individual um you know the destiny if you want to call it but biological destiny you know the from the
womb to to a million years before to what happened three seconds ago determines our neural response to
something and you take that cumulatively to our world today and it seems to me that our world is
heading in the direction of more of the violence more of the competitiveness more of the us versus them
as a cumulative species species and and with that determinism in a in a very interesting way
it it sometimes feels like we can't even impact that anymore that you know there will be more wars
there will be more economic challenges that are creating gaps between the rich and the poor and
so on and so forth do you believe that to be true is that is there a way to change that at all
yes you can do it if you turned out to be the right sort of person by going and reading history
and realizing oh in a place like western europe 300 years ago would have seemed okay for a five-year-old
to be worked to death in a factory and just a different world now wow the world changed it we can
get it from historical evidence or if you're the sort of person where what does it for you is to read
about somebody else's amazing acts of compassion and making the world better or if you're the right
sort of person you can look at a point where you thought i wouldn't be able to do i can't do that
that's too but but i did that i succeeded i was able i have the power to do like and maybe you have
become the sort of person who could reflect enough to figure out which of those are the types of
experiences you should go try to experience because you know that's the sort of thing that makes me
feel more of this and makes me feel more empowered and makes me feel and like to go read about the how
they managed to get the good friday truce in northern ireland and ended violent conflict there that
seemed impossible to ever end and whoa like that's pop there's reasons to be out or the time you were
about to be a jerk and cut somebody off in traffic and you had this thought and you decided to you
know let them in to be wow think about how you felt figure out what it is that did that for you
because you could make a difference and i think what the underpinning is of that is like every other
living species out there we're just biological machines but we're the only ones who could know
that we are biological machines and learn where the buttons are and exactly read the manual and realize
if i press this button again i'm going to feel this way even more because i'm going to have more
examples to draw upon and go and do that go figure out what it is that gives you hope in a world in which
there's so many reasons not to and you know my guess is there's an awful lot of people who will use you
as an example for precisely that and thus their biological machines can work differently afterward and
feel a sense of efficacy um that they didn't before and thus their free will lacking biological machines
who could now go make the world a better place because of you that's wow i mean you see this is
this is why i always i never resist any of your views anymore i just investigate them a little more
you see this is the whole point we started at the com with a conversation that said this biological
machine can trigger amazing things can trigger empathy and can trigger evil it can trigger violence it can
trigger everything and that while the entire configuration of your machine is the result of a
million as a probably a gazillion little triggers that that you never had any control over you can
reconfigure that machine by actually finding out exactly how it's working right now and and then
finding out how it's behaving right now and then slowly using your strengths to to to basically become
a better contribution to this world and to yourself and to others and to me this is fascinating in every
possible way i mean uh i i have to say i i really want to end here if you if you allow me to say to do
this uh give you more time but also give our listeners the opportunity to listen to this twice instead of
listening to a longer conversation there were so many so many gold nuggets in this conversation that
i think would change lives so guys if you're listening please do uh go back and and take the
time to listen to this again uh robert what an honor thank you so much for your time for everything that
you contribute so uh simply uh you know even though it has a massive depth be you know underneath it so
i'm really grateful for your time and for you being here well thank you and you've just taken the
words out of my mouth of exactly what i would say to you so it's it's an honor it's an honor here you're
very very kind um i i hope you'd allow me the opportunity to host you again and maybe you have
another conversation i'd be delighted to and for all of you listening this has definitely been one of my
favorites you know me when i am really into a conversation i'd really urge you to go and listen
to this i'd really urge you to share it with a lot of people and i'd really urge you to read dr robert's
work it's just so eye-opening challenging to our our main ways of wanting to believe that we are at first
but so so deep and so valuable underneath uh at the end of the day we are a biological machine that is
highly affected by the stresses of this world but we can actually uh make a difference if we understand
how the machine really works uh part of that of course is what i always advocate every single week
to take a tiny bit of time to slow down and reflect and learn oh and yeah before i go uh i just want to
remind you to go pre-order unstressable it would really help me spread the message if you pre-order
pre-orders uh tend to count for the first week of sales and the book industry is quite interesting
because it's only the first week of sales that really matters to put you on a bestseller list
my mission uh with alice this time is a million people out of stress so your pre-order will make
a difference uh keep your pre-order receipt uh go to unstressable.com and register so that you can
uh come and join us in our uh launch webinar for two hours uh me and alice where we will explain the
main concepts and allow you uh to ask us as many questions as you want uh as i say always take a
few minutes to slow down reflect go back and listen uh to uh robert's uh conversation today i think you'll
find it very very useful i love you all for listening and i will see you next time
