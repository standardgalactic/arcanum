The house has really come together, it's cleaned, it's more functional.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
Do you want to see some now?
Paradiso, a little paradise.
Do you want to see some now?
Do you want to see some now?
Do you want to see some now?
You're from Brazilian heat.
Yeah.
Kind of four or three.
Let's see.
What is that?
Chorizo.
Chorizo, yes.
Chorizo for my friends.
Eme, are you finished with the stove or are you going to still use it?
Are you finished with the stove?
Are you still cooking?
I want to use this to make pancakes.
What do you say?
I'm so powerful in the planet.
I'm sharing amazing things in the world and peace in the world.
Do you want to be careful of the angle?
Which we are.
That's what I am.
You're so beautiful.
I want to listen to everything you like to say, a wise one.
You're playing with the essence of the universe again.
I've probably told you about that fire from a show that they did in Mexico.
About a month ago?
It's all face paint and stuff.
Oh, yeah.
Super fun.
So confidence building.
Oh, yeah.
People love it.
It brings so much pleasure.
That's the beauty of it.
It makes me so happy.
Yeah, all the smiling and happy faces.
It's so stoked.
And it's how much joy we got last night.
And just playing and having fun.
Like, it's pretty cool.
Pretty cool moments.
That's why I do what I do.
And I realize that wasn't really great.
Do you give me a humor to either of my flashlights out?
Uh, nope.
You have myth makers in AM.
What do you guys do?
Do people pay?
Do you like going to play?
No, we do.
No, we do auditions in the spring.
In the name of the workshop.
Yeah.
In the name of the workshop.
Get people after hanging out and stuff like that and seeing what the group dynamic is kind
of thing.
It's really good for me because then I can see who works energetically and doesn't.
Some people can be amazing performers.
But when they live in a community for like a week or two together, it's just like, obviously
you don't want that person on a bus with 12 other people, you know, for a month or two.
Because, you know, some people are doing it.
They don't wear black masks.
And both of them went missing yesterday from my area.
One of them is a headlamp and an energizer headlamp.
And the other one is a black metal flashlight with multicolored LED.
So if anybody, like, has any idea about where they are, please let me know.
That's it.
It's broken.
It needs to be cleaned.
Which I can do with like a two phase epoxy.
Wow, check out that little guy.
Little furball.
Looks like a lion.
That's so sweet.
Or a tiger.
We just washed their eyes, but they need to be washed, like, already.
Yeah.
I think there's lots of parts that kind of travel in that way, huh?
They just...
Mamacita.
Gatita.
Hola.
Que preciosa.
