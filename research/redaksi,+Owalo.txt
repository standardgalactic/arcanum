This work investigates the effects of Yoruba-English Code-
mixing on the Yoruba language. From a sociolinguistic 
perspective, it examines the reasons why people code-mix 
English with Yoruba and the effects of the code-mixing on the 
Yoruba language. The study is modeled after Crystal’s (2000) 
theory of language death. Data for the study was collected 
with the use of self-designed questionnaire which was 
administered to 100 respondents. The analysis of the 
responses shows that a number of lexical items of the Yoruba 
language have been lost by the native speakers as a result 
Yoruba-English code-mixing. It also reveals that this 
sociolinguistic phenomenon may hamper the growth and 
development of the Yoruba language as it has become more 
convenient for Yoruba speakers to code-mix than to coin new 
words for new concepts, items or ideas. The study, therefore, 
concludes that uncontrolled Yoruba-English code-mixing 
may render the use of the Yoruba language moribund, 
consequently leading to the death of the language. It is
recommended that the native speakers of Yoruba should make 
conscious efforts to use “pure” Yoruba, minimizing the use of 
code-mix.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Nigeria is a multilingual community with 
most of its citizens at least bilingual; the 
reason for this is the fact that the languages in 
Nigeria come in contact with one another on 
a regular basis. It is normal for there to be 
influence when speakers of two or more come 
in contact and interact. When languages come 
in contact, a lot of linguistic processes take 
place, such as the evolvement of pidgins, 
according to Adedimeji (2010:3) pidgin 
English is a combination of “[the] English 
language (the superstrate) and Nigerian 
languages (the substrate). A lot of borrowings 
also occur as well as code-mixing. Code-
mixing is simply the combination of 
languages in a speech event, mostly intra-
sentential. There are possibilities that one who 
is exposed to more than one language use 
them together at particular times during 
conversation. The reasons for this are 
countless but the utmost concern of this study 
is the effect of code-mixing on the languages 
that are involved.   
 
This study focuses on the effects of code-
mixing Yoruba with English. These two

languages co-exist side by side in Nigeria. 
English language is a world language. The 
English language is widely spread and this is 
due to the widespread of the first speakers of 
the language. The coming of Europeans to 
Nigeria in 1553 for commercial purposes 
accounts for the contact of Nigeria with the 
English language. On their arrival, there was 
a major gap in communication, and the need 
to bridge this gap became very necessary. 
There was the need to find a means of 
communication between the Europeans and 
the many ethnic nationalities, now referred to 
as Nigeria. Pidgin English was fashioned. 
 
The English language has played on the 
seeming inadequacies of the Nigeria’s 
national languages. It has risen so high, 
gained grounds and has thus become the 
language of prestige, desired by everyone. In 
fact, acceptance in the Nigerian society is 
based on how well and how fluent one’s use 
of English is. One cannot help but wonder 
what the lot of those who cannot speak it is. 
The implication of all this is that the country’s 
indigenous languages have been relegated and 
the users of them are seen as people who 
cannot properly fit into the society. Even 
though certain measures and attempts have 
been made by several bodies and the 
government to somewhat increase the value 
and usefulness of the indigenous languages, 
there has been little or no improvements 
because some of the policies made have been 
left unattended to.  
 
The contact of the Yoruba people with the 
English language has brought about code-
mixing which of course is one of the 
manifestations of language contact. People 
find it convenient to shuffle English words in 
the use of the Yoruba language and this has 
effects on the Yoruba language. These effects 
could be long term or short term, finding this 
out is the pre-occupation of this study.  
 
Bello (2007:18-19) observes that code-
mixing has adverse effects on semi-educated 
Yoruba/English bilinguals; the speakers end 
up not being competent in either languages, 
she gave the following examples: 
a. Mo mo nkan ti mo contain (I know my 
worth) 
b. O fabricate iro yen ni (he conceived the 
lie) 
c. Ile wa focus (our house is conspicuously 
positioned) 
d. Mo gazette e ki nto kan an (I positioned 
it before nailing it) 
e. Olopa yen gazette ori e (the policeman 
aimed at his head) 
One thing is evident from the examples above 
that the English words involved in the code-
mixing are not even properly used. The first 
example, ‘contain’ is used to mean ‘worth’, 
meanwhile in the contexts above they are not 
synonyms and cannot be used as substitutes.  
Therefore it could be said that code-mixing 
alternatives are not always correct, but 
context sheds more light on the meaning that 
is intended. Bello (2007:19) also observes that 
there is inappropriateness in code-mixing is 
both grammatical and semantics; this is 
because there is no meaningful relationship 
between what is said and what is meant. She 
further says that speakers seem to be 
incompetent in the use of both languages.  
 
Humaira (2012) looked at the importance of 
mixing/code-switching in classroom settings 
and discovered the following: 
a. When teachers code-mix, they do not do 
it consciously, they do not know 
functions and outcomes of this process 
b. Students on their own code-switch for 
equivalence 
c. Students also code-mix to hold the floor 
in a conversation or speech event 
d. In a classroom setting, code-mixing 
allows for message reinforcement, for 
emphasis or clarification of already sent 
message 
e. In a classroom setting, it is used or 
introduced for conflict control.  
Ayeomoni (2006) looks at code-mixing and 
code-switching in the childhood language of 
certain children in Nigeria, it was observed 
that most children are exposed to two 
languages right from primary school. And so

they begin to code-mix because they have not 
properly learnt the grammar of both 
languages, it is easy to take from here and 
there to make a complete sentence. According 
to him, code-mixing has both negative and 
positive effects on a child. The responsibility 
lies on the language teacher to ensure that the 
students take good advantage of the 
sociolinguistic phenomenon.  
 
Code-mixing is a sociolinguistic phenomenon 
that cannot be wished away, this is because it 
serves good purposes; but the problem lies 
where code-mixing begins to adversely affect 
the speaker and the language(s) involved. 
Bello (2007) noted that it affects indigenous 
languages and affects the competence of the 
speaker in the use of either language.  
 
II. METHODS 
This study is modeled after Crystal’s (2000) 
theory of language death. He observes that 
language death is harsh; an unwelcoming yet 
true, and it is just like the death of human 
beings. He states that languages die with the 
death of their speakers. He notes that  
“the people may live but the language 
may still die…the members of a 
community remain alive and well, often 
continuing to inhabit their traditional 
territory; but their language nonetheless 
goes into decline, and eventually 
disappears to be replaced by some other 
languages”. 
He further states that one culture can 
influence or dominate the other(s), and people 
start adopting the dominant culture, their 
mores and values. This dominance will 
gradually touch on the language of the 
subjugated and eventually swarm it. He points 
out that languages that lack prestige lose out 
to the prestigious ones as the speakers do not 
feel safe using the former but adores using the 
latter. The status of the indigenous languages 
becomes gradually eroded until nobody wants 
to use them again. 
 
The instrument used for data collection in this 
study is a questionnaire. The questionnaire 
has twenty nine (29) items divided into three 
sections. The first section comprises the 
biographical data. The second section 
comprises ten (10) items, they are close-ended 
questions aimed at surveying opinions of 
respondents on the rate and likely effects of 
code-mixing. The third section asked an open 
ended question on the reason why people 
code-mix. Respondents were asked to provide 
Yoruba words for some lexical items written 
in 
English. 
Respondents 
were 
Yoruba/English bilinguals in the University 
of Ilorin. They were 100 in number. 
 
III. 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
Many 
Nigerians 
cannot 
speak 
their 
indigenous 
languages 
without 
adding 
English words to it.

Table 1 shows that 44% of the respondents 
strongly agree that many Nigerians cannot 
speak their indigenous languages without 
adding English words to it, 46% agree, 6% 
strongly disagree, 3% disagree and 1% is 
indifferent. From the data obtained, it is clear 
that people aware that code-mixing has 
become part and parcel of Nigerian linguistic 
setting, this is due to the fact that Nigerians 
are exposed to many languages; Nigeria being 
a multi-lingual state. This exposure has made 
it almost impossible not to code-mix. The 
reasons for which people code-mix are so 
many but the negatives almost outweigh the 
positives. The effect of code-mixing on our 
indigenous languages has somewhat been 
adverse, it could be said that on the positive 
side it aids communication. 
 
Code-mixing Yoruba with English language 
can lead to the gradual death of Yoruba 
language

Table 2 reveals that 28% of the respondents 
strongly agree that Yoruba-English Code-
mixing have effects on the Yoruba language, 
36% agree, 14% strongly disagree and 22% 
disagree. This implies that code-mixing 
affects the indigenous languages in that 
gradually words are lost in the lexicon of the 
Nigeria’s indigenous languages because they 
are replaced by the English language 
representations 
of 
such 
senses. 
It 
is 
convenient to code-mix and so people do not 
bother to know the indigenous representations 
of certain words, and at the end of the day, 
English takes over since that is what is known. 
Imagine that this happens for most words in 
the Yoruba lexicon, then there is little or 
nothing left.  
 
It is not only the death of speakers, or their 
being swarm by larger and stronger languages 
that leads a language to death; speakers can 
kill their own languages. The death and decay 
of a language can start gradually, when 
speakers start replacing words in it with words 
from other languages. Words in Yoruba 
language are being replaced with their 
English counterparts,  and for such words, 
speakers may hardly remember they exist.  
Dorian (1998:1) says that “languages are 
seldom admired to death but are frequently 
despised to death”, indigenous languages in 
Nigeria has been treated as second fiddles 
even among the owners of the language. 
English is the language of prestige and has so 
much function accrue to it; it is the language 
of education, governance, basic interactions 
and so on. To a very large extent, English 
defines status in Nigeria, except of course if 
money redefines the status of an individual 
who is a bad user of the English language. 
 
Dorian (1988:1) further asserts that “it is 
fairly common for a language to become so 
exclusively associated with low-prestige 
people 
and 
their 
socially 
disfavoured 
identities that its own potential speakers 
prefer to distance themselves from it and 
adopt some other language”.  This is exactly 
the 
case 
with 
English 
and 
Nigerian 
indigenous languages. People want to be 
associated with English language; even 
illiterates want to be able to speak a word or 
two in English language when the opportunity 
for it arises. Parents are reluctant to transfer 
the ancestral language to their children, which 
lead to the gradual loss of the language.  
   
Many people code-mix to show a level of 
knowledge of the English language

Table 3 shows that 27% of the respondents 
strongly agree that code-mixing confers 
linguistic prestige on people, 50% agree, 19% 
strongly disagree while 4% disagree.  This 
affirms that many people code-mix to show 
that they have a level of understanding of the 
English language, even when it is unnecessary 
to do so. People love to how that they 
understand or know English and so they use it 
every now and then while speaking even in 
Yoruba. It becomes alarming that even 
illiterates and semi-literates will do the same 
at any given opportunity to show knowledge 
and feel recognised. This is due to the prestige 
given English language in Nigeria today. The 
truth is that code-mixing shows more of 
incompetence than competence. Inability to 
get lexical items in a language to express 
oneself will make someone code-mix, so 
rather than show knowledge, sometimes it 
may be a pointer to incompetence on the part 
of the speaker.

Yoruba-English Code-mixing causes under-
development of Yoruba language especially 
its ability to provide words for new concepts 
or foreign ideas.

Table 4 shows that 37% of respondents 
strongly agree that code-mixing can cause the 
underdevelopment of Yoruba language, 50% 
agree, 12% strongly disagree while just 1% 
disagrees.  Languages can live as much as 
they can die, they reproduce; this is why there 
are new words for new concepts around the 
world, languages have the ability to birth new 
names for new or foreign ideas. Languages 
develop and should not be static, if it is static 
it is only for a while; in less than no time, 
regression sets in. code-mixing will not allow 
for 
development 
of 
local 
languages; 
especially their ability to give names to new 
words, concepts or ideas (especially if they 
are foreign). It becomes very convenient to 
code-mix than to coin new words for such 
concepts. Even if there are new words, it will 
be easier for people to code-mix rather than 
look for those words. 
 
Yoruba-English Code-mixing may lead to 
incompetence in both languages involved

Table 5 shows that 47% of the respondents 
strongly agree that Code-mixing may result to 
incompetence in both languages involved 
especially if the speaker does not have a 
proper mastery of both languages. 40% agree, 
5% strongly disagree, 6% disagree while 2% 
are indifferent.  When speakers know only 
bits of this language and bits of that and just 
augment them to cover up for deficiency, 
he/she may not be able to master either 
languages properly. 
 
An average educated Yoruba speaker prefers 
speaking English to speaking Yoruba.

prefer to speak English than speak their 
indigenous language, 46% agree, 21 %

indifferent. This is exactly the case with 
English and Nigerian indigenous languages 
especially the Yoruba language. People want 
to be associated with the English language; 
even illiterates want to be able to speak a word 
or two in the English language when the 
opportunity for it arises. Parents are reluctant 
to transfer the ancestral language to their 
children, which lead to the gradual loss of the 
language. Educated Nigerians prefer to use 
English language for communication, it 
shows class and status; even illiterates or 
semi-literates who know only a couple of 
words want to use them at any given 
opportunity. 
 
People can control code-mixing.

Table 7 shows that 50% of the people who 
responded strongly agree that people can 
actually control the urge to code-mix, 34% 
agree, 11% strongly disagree, 4% disagree 
and 1% didn’t respond. The implication of 
this is that it may be difficult but code-mixing 
can be controlled and minimized so that it is 
only used when there is a genuine use for it 
such as to aid communication, for clarity of 
speech, to quote another person verbatim and 
so on. Consciously, speakers can minimize or 
control the rate of code-mixing. It should be 
noted that code-mixing is not an aberration to 
a sociolinguistic setting, but uncontrolled; it 
can damage a whole lot. 
 
Code-mixing aids communication

Table 8 shows that 30% strongly agree that 
code-mixing can aid communication, 40% 
agree, 21% strongly disagree and 9% 
disagree. In other words, at particular times, 
code-mixing makes communicating easier, 
especially when the interlocutors use different 
indigenous languages and one person doesn’t 
understand English well, code-mixing makes 
things easy. It is used for emphasis and also to 
exclude 
some 
other 
people 
from 
communication. 
 
If Yoruba-English code-mixing is not 
controlled it can affect the Yoruba language

Table 9 shows that 41% of respondents 
strongly agree that there is a need to control 
Yoruba-English code-mixing for the good of 
Yoruba language. 50% agree, 7% strongly 
disagree and 2% disagree. This means that if 
code-mixing is not controlled, and English 
remains a language of prestige and people feel 
safe using the English language because of its 
status, it will negatively affect the use and 
status of the Yoruba language. Words will 
gradually be lost and then gradual death may 
set in. 
  
The reasons given by respondents on why 
people code-mix 
a. Incompetence in one’s native language 
and more exposure to English leads to 
code-mixing. 
They 
cannot 
find 
appropriate words for an expression, they 
code-mix. This way there is clarity of 
expression 
b. People code-mix to show others that they 
are educated, and they know how to speak 
the English language 
c. It is fashionable to code-mix, it has 
become a custom 
d. People code-mix so that people who do 
not understand their indigenous language 
can have an idea of what is been said 
e. Some people code-mix to show they are 
educated and refined 
f. It has become a way of showing ‘levels’ 
or class among ‘big boys’ and ‘big girls’.  
g. Social and technological developments 
make people code-mix because there will 
be new terms in the foreign language that 
the local languages may not be able to 
provide words for.   
IV. CONCLUSION 
The effects of code-mixing on Yoruba 
language can be both negative and positive. 
Research has shown that uncontrolled code-
mixing is one slow killer of any language. It 
is very obvious that for reasons well known, 
Nigerians cannot do without code-mixing, 
especially when they are exposed to the two 
languages and can speak both fairly well. It is 
not only the death of the speakers of a 
language that or their being swarm by a larger 

OWOLOLA OLUWASEUN/ JURNAL ARBITRER - VOL. 5. NO. 1 (2018)  
 
 
29
or stronger language that can lead to language 
death, preference of one language over the 
other(s) can lead to the death of a language. 
  
Death and decay of a language starts 
gradually, when speakers of the language 
starts replacing words in it with words from 
other languages, when words in Yoruba are 
replaced with their English counterparts, for 
such words the speakers rarely remember they 
exist again and that word is gone. Languages 
should develop and should not be static, it 
should be able to make available new words 
for new items, but code-mixing will not allow 
this because it is an available alternative. The 
language will not grow; it comes to a point of 
standstill, retrogression sets in and then the 
process of decaying starts.  
Code-mixing 
should 
be 
consciously 
controlled and minimized, it is easier to 
deliberately decide to speak one language 
through a conversation; it helps, when 
mistakes are made, people notice and then 
correct, the process of learning continues. But 
when incompetence is covered up by code-
mixing, the inadequacies are not notices and 
it leads to incompetence. Conscious efforts 
should be made to control this. 
 
Language teachers should treat it as urgent, 
explaining the advantages and disadvantages 
of this phenomenon and helping students 
through correctly and efficiently using code-
mixing to their advantage and not allowing it 
affect their competence and performance.
