Is Nigerian Pidgin English English? 
Akinmade T. Akande 
Abstract 
The major aim of this paper is to demonstrate through the grammar of the verb 
phrase in Standard English (StdE) and Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) that NPE is 
a distinct language. The paper draws on data collected from 30 Nigerian Univer-
sity Graduates from three ethnolinguistic regions. Although many scholars have 
pointed out that NPE is a language (Agheyisi 1971; Elugbe and Omamor 1991), 
not many of them have examined the verb phrase in NPE with a view to showing 
that its grammar is distinctive. It has been shown in this paper that the NPE verb 
phrase is sharply different from StdE verb phrase, and because the verb is at the 
centre of the clause and can determine its argument, it can be argued that NPE 
whose verbal grammar is radically different from that of English is a separate lan-
guage. The pattern of clustering of NPE verb phrases with other NPE verb phrases 
or other crieterial features of NPE is also a demonstration that NPE is a distinct 
language. Finally, the subjects made sharp switches from StdE to NPE, speaking 
in blocks of first one code and then the other: this is like the behaviour of bilin-
guals moving from one language to another. 
1.0 Introduction 
This paper discusses the issue of language/dialect distinction with reference 
to the relationship of Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) to English. Most scho-
lars who have worked on NPE regarded it as a separate language from Eng-
lish (Agheyisi 1971, 1988; Deuber 2005; Elugbe and Omamor 1991; Oma-
mor 1982) although all of them, of course, recognise the close relationship 
that NPE has with English. There are, however, some scholars who claim 
that there is a continuum between Standard English (StdE) and NPE (e.g 
Brosnahan 1958; Todd 1994). Those who have considered the relationship 
between StdE and NPE as manifesting a continuum have actually extended 
the theory of Creole Continuum propounded by DeCamp (1971) to English-
based Pidgins in West Africa. As cited in Deuber (2005: 22), Todd (1974) 
opines that a continuum exists between English-based Creole and its lexifi-
er wherever both co-exist in the world. Two decades after this view, she 
(Todd 1994: 3181) again reiterates this continuum phenomenon in Nigeria. 
She uses the following example to illustrate the continuum between NPE 
and English:

Bickerton (1975), citing Guyana and Nigeria as examples, notes that there 
were no intermediate varieties between StdE and NPE before independence 
but that after independence, a continuum which is apparent in the novels of 
Achebe developed. Brosnahan (1958) classifies NPE as the lowest form of 
English in Nigeria and this suggests that, contrary to Bickerton’s (1975) 
view, a continuum had existed between NPE and StdE even before inde-
pendence. Peter and Wolf (2007: 5) also note that there is no strict barrier 
between varieties of West African English and their pidgins and creoles. 
Agheyisi is one of the scholars who have argued that NPE is a separate 
language (Agheyisi 1971, 1984, 1988). Agheyisi (1984: 230) argues that we 
can have educated speakers learner varieties of NPE with English interfer-
ence but states, as quoted in Deuber (2005: 23), that 
the relationship that exists between these varieties and NSE [Nigerian 
Standard English] cannot be described as that of a continuum, in the 
same sense that creole-speaking communities in the Caribbean region 
[…] have been shown to manifest this phenomenon. In other words, 
the NPE variety which has been designated here as interlanguage PE 
[Pidgin English] does not constitute a ‘mesolect’ in a possible conti-
nuum that might be said to have the Pidgin-proper variety as the ‘basi-
lect’ and NSE as the ‘acrolect’. 
Elugbe and Omamor (1991: 61) explain that the sentences in NPE cannot 
be accounted for in terms of the grammar of English and that the sound sys-
tem of NPE ‘clearly indicates that the system in NP is sufficiently different 
from the one which operates in English.” Jowitt (1991: 54) points out that 
both NPE and English ‘are fairly discontinuous.’ Deuber (2005: 51) says 
that the greatest advantage of NPE over English and the other ancestral lan-
guages is that “it is the most neutral language in Nigeria: it has neither the 
elitist connotations of English nor the ethnic connotations of the indigenous 
languages.” It is clear from the above views that these scholars agree that 
NPE is a language, mostly because its grammar is distinct from that of Eng-
lish or any other variety of English.  
This paper argues that NPE is a distinct language. It focuses in the main 
on the complex verb phrase in both StdE and NPE; and also examines the 
patterns of switches as well as the clustering of NPE features in order to 
demonstrate that NPE is an independent language. The paper concentrates on 
the verb because the verb (phrase) is at the centre of the clause since it is usu-

ally the only obligatory element within a clause (except in verbless clauses, 
such as in the first clause in (Although not very happy about it), he agreed to 
go). Allerton (1982: 1) notes that the “centrality of the verb in the sentence is 
that the kind of verb that is selected for a particular sentence determines the 
basic structure of that sentence.” This in turn implies that it is the verb that 
determines its argument(s). Allerton (1982) discusses this extensively and 
explains the problems associated with valency especially in English.  
When two codes do not share a common descent, identifying them as 
two separate languages is unproblematic. However, when two codes are 
historically-related and have the bulk of their lexis in common, as is the 
case between English and NPE, the issue is problematic. Since Standard 
English (StdE) is uncontroversially a dialect of English, I will not go into 
any debate as to what StdE is or what it is not. Rather, I focus here on NPE, 
whose status is somewhat controversial. The major question this paper ad-
dresses, therefore, is: Is it best to see NPE as a language separate from 
English or as a dialect of English? 
NPE is an English-lexifier contact variety which emerged due to contact 
between Nigerians and the British (and other Europeans) probably as far 
back as the seventeenth century. NPE is spoken by more than half of the 
total population of Nigeria today (Faraclas 2004: 828; Ihemere 2006: 297). 
NPE is also used in the media and many creative writers (e.g., Chinua 
Achebe, Wole Soyinka; Ken Saro-Wiwa) have used it in their literary 
works either to signal characters’ educational background or to express a 
character’s ideological stance towards English.  
An area which NPE has not permeated in any serious way is instruction in 
schools. This domain is considered strictly formal. NPE also has no official 
status in Nigeria and is not used in any governmental documentation. The 
relationship between NPE and StdE can thus be described as a case of diglos-
sia (Ferguson 1959). Deuber’s (2005: 52) noted that English dominates in all 
H domains and is formally acquired, while NPE is used in L domains and is 
informally acquired. In this paper, I start with the assumption that NPE is a 
dialect of English functioning as an L-variety (Ferguson 1959). 
2.0 Diglossia criteriality model 
Ferguson’s (1959: 325) definition entailed the co-existence of two varieties 
of a language in society. For the varieties to have a diglossic relationship; it 
must be the case that they are used in specified different domains and have 
specified different functions. The H-variety is considered more prestigious 
because of its mode of acquisition (formal). It is codified, it is the medium 
of instruction in schools and it might be designated as an official language.

The L-variety is seldom or never used to carry out any of these functions. 
English and NPE are two historically-related codes. While English is the H-
variety and functions not only as an official code but also as a medium of 
instruction in schools, NPE, the L-variety, is used mainly as a lingua franca 
and as a code for both intra and inter-ethnic communication in informal set-
tings especially. Also, English enjoys high prestige in Nigeria while NPE 
has low prestige. 
Gupta (1991; 1994) suggests that English in Singapore is in a diglossic re-
lationship. She describes Singapore Colloquial English (SCE, also known as 
Singlish) as an L-form which is spoken in informal settings (such as home) 
while Standard English is used as a medium of instruction in schools and in 
other formal situations (p. 324). As in Singapore, when someone is able to use 
the H-variety (StdE) as well as the L variety (NPE) in Nigeria, their choice 
between these codes is often determined by social context that are similar to 
the domains associated with H and L in Ferguson’s classic diglossia.  
In this essay, I apply Gupta’s (1994: 9–13) notion of criteriality in relation 
to the diglossic situation between StdE and NPE. The criteriality model is a 
contrastive method to test if diglossia holds. This method consists in focusing 
on the unique features of each of the varieties being compared. When there 
are two closely related codes, salient features are established that define each 
of the codes and mark each different from the other, and they are then quanti-
fied, allowing one text to be compared to another, and showing by their dis-
tribution, where switches from one code to another occur. 
Being an English-lexifier contact variety, NPE’s lexicon is almost en-
tirely drawn from English. Since NPE does not make use of inflections, 
there is no objective way of determining whether uninflected words are 
English or NPE words as the following examples show: 
1) I need money. 
2) I chop it. 
3) I show them. 
All the words in these three examples are shared by both English and NPE. 
The two codes are also structurally alike in many respects. In both codes: 
a)  the word order is SVO  
b)  adjectives precede nouns 
c)  all the pronouns in English are also present in NPE although there 
are two additional pronouns which are unique to NPE (am and una). 
d) auxiliary verbs precede lexical verbs. 
e) the ordering of auxiliaries in relation to lexical verbs is systematic 
and rule governed.

The major area where (Standard) English is grammatically different from 
NPE is in the area of inflectional morphology. While the use of 3rd person 
singular present tense, past tense and past participle requires verbal inflec-
tions in English, NPE verbs “do not take inflectional affixes to show tense, 
aspect or modality” (Faraclas 2004: 829) as the following examples show: 
4) He goes to school everyday. (Standard English) 
5) Hin go school everyday. (NPE) – (He goes to school everyday) 
6) He went to school yesterday. (Standard English) 
7) Hin go school yesterday. (NPE) – (He went to school yesterday) 
8) He has gone to school now. (Standard English) 
9) Hin don go school now. (NPE) – (He has gone to school now) 
One important criterial feature of NPE, which distinguishes it from Standard 
English, is the presence of TMA auxiliaries. These TMA auxiliaries (e.g. 
been, don, for, go, dey), which many scholars have described as preverbal 
markers (Deuber 2005; Faraclas 1996; 2004), are not found in Standard Eng-
lish. On the one hand, when the lexical verb in a verb phrase is preceded by 
any of the TMA auxiliaries, it is indisputably an NPE verb phrase and the 
clause or the sentence in which it appears is unarguably an NPE clause or 
sentence as in I don sell it where don sell is an NPE verb phrase. On the other 
hand, a verb phrase that contains any of the primary auxiliaries (i.e. be, have, 
do), modal auxiliaries (e.g. can, could, shall, may) or semi-modal auxiliaries 
(e.g. ought to, want to, need to) is uncontroversially a Standard English verb 
phrase and the sentence in which it occurs is a Standard English sentence 
(Akande 2008). An example of this is I can go tomorrow.  
Also, while inflectional suffixes are required on nouns to mark plurality 
and genitive in Standard English, such noun inflections are optional in NPE 
as in: 
10) They bought two pencils. (Standard English) 
11) Them buy two pencil. (NPE) – (They bought two pencils) 
12) This is Akin’s book. (Standard English)  
13) Na Akin book be that. (NPE) – (That is Akin’s book) 
Similarly, certain relative pronouns (e.g. wey and wetin) are found in NPE 
only as in: 
14) Na me go see the man wey go bring money. (NPE) – (It is me 
who will see the man who will bring the money) 
15) I don do wetin you say make I do. (NPE) – (I have don what you 
said I should do) 
It is also only in NPE that certain pronouns (like am and una) can be found, 
as in:

16) People don talk am plenty time. – (People have said it several 
times) 
17) Me I see una for town. – (I saw you in town) 
Also criterial of NPE is the occurrence of the pronoun them in the subject 
position. Them cannot occupy the subject position in Standard English whe-
reas, as example 8 indicates, it can occupy the subject position in NPE. As 
examples 4 to 17 show, there are some features which are unique to Stan-
dard English while there are others which are unique to NPE. Such features 
which distinguish one code from another are termed criterial features in 
this work. 
3.0 Language/dialect debates 
It is well-known that it is often difficult to differentiate a dialect from a lan-
guage (Chambers and Trudgill 1980: 4; Hudson 1980:3 7; Melchers and 
Shaw 2003: 11; Myers-Scotton 2006: 17). As Mesthrie (2000: 9) noted, 
“linguists are unable to offer a definition of what constitutes ‘a language’ in 
relation to overlapping entities like ‘dialects.’” Mutual intelligibility is one 
of the major criteria invoked for grouping two or more varieties as dialects 
of the same language (Chambers and Trudgill 1980: 3–4; Dixon 1980: 33; 
Hudson 1980: 35; Skutnabb-Kangas 1981: 60). 
Standard English is codified and standardised while NPE has not been 
codified or standardised. Standard English has a strict spelling convention 
with little choice and numerous grammar books. NPE, however, has multi-
ple spelling systems, as are reflected in the works of NPE scholars (Aghey-
isi 1971; Deuber 2005; Elugbe and Omamor 1991; Faraclas 1996; Mafeni 
1971). Standard English is linked to education by virtue of its codification 
and standardisation. It has social prestige whereas NPE does not enjoy this 
kind of social prestige as it “has no official recognition and is without any 
policy statement” (Igboanusi 2008: 69). The treatment it (NPE) receives 
from both the government and Nigerian populace is due largely to ambiva-
lent attitudes towards it. 
Another way of finding out whether a code is a dialect or a language is 
by considering what people say about it. There is no agreement on the way 
NPE is viewed by Nigerians generally. The lack of agreement is due to the 
status of NPE to individuals. What people say about their code can be prob-
lematic. For instance, for political reason, some people consider Scots as a 
distinct language from English while there are others who regard it as a va-
riety of English. The same applies to Xhosa and Zulu in South Africa. 
Xhosa and Zulu are not only similar in structure, they are mutually intelli-
gible. Also, the cultures of Xhosa and Zulu speakers in South Africa are

similar and the two are historically related; yet they are generally consid-
ered and treated as two separate languages by their speakers and are recog-
nised as such by the government (Mesthrie 2000: 9). 
The distinction between English and NPE as evident in the literature 
(Deuber 2005; Elugbe and Omamor 1991; Faraclas 1996) is problematic as 
it implies that there is no appreciable overlap in the way Nigerians speak 
both codes. In reality, most of the sounds that are used by Nigerians while 
speaking StdE are used even in NPE. For instance, many Nigerians neutral-
ise the distinctions between interdental fricatives (i.e. /θ, ð/) and alveolar 
plosives (i.e. /t, d/) in StdE and realise them as alveolar plosives in both 
StdE and NPE. The point being made here is that the status of NPE is not 
clear in Nigeria.  
4.0 Methodology 
The data used in this study was drawn from my PhD research. The subjects 
who constituted the source for the data consisted of 30 male Nigerian univer-
sity graduates (NUGs); 10 of whom were selected through a judgement sam-
pling technique (Chambers 2002) from Ife (representing the Southwest where 
Yoruba is mainly spoken), Kano (representing the North where Hausa is 
mainly spoken) and Nsukka (representing the East where Igbo is mainly spo-
ken). Sociolinguistic interview was conducted with them and each informant 
was interviewed for an average of one hour. The data was therefore from re-
cordings of natural face-to-face interviews. The 30 NUGs whose responses 
were used here were given 36 prompt sentences. They were asked to identify 
the sentences and classify them into groups. While some of the sentences 
were written in StdE and non-StdE, some were written in NPE and ‘incor-
rect’ NPE. These sentences served as a stimulus which enabled NUGs to talk 
about language generally and about StdE and NPE specifically (see Appen-
dix I). This approach is similar to the one used in the Survey of Regional 
English (Kerswill, Upton and Llamas 1999; Upton and Llamas 1999). The 
use of prompt sentences was especially successful as the subjects were trig-
gered to use both StdE and NPE during the interview.  
In the analysis of the spontaneous speech of NUGs, features criterial of 
StdE were tagged differently from features criterial of NPE. The StdE com-
plex verb phrases are italicised while the NPE complex verb phrases, in 
addition to being italicised, were also underlined. The tagging was done in 
order to enable me to find out if StdE features clustered with other StdE 
features and also if NPE features clustered with other NPE features. The 
subjects from Ife were tagged F1 to F10, those from Kano were labelled K1 
to K10 while Nsukka’s subjects were tagged N1 to N10. As an example, the

VPs in “I don buy<NPEVP> pen which I will use<StdEVP>” will be tagged 
as illustrated; where NPEVP and StdEVP stand for Nigerian Pidgin English 
verb phrase and Standard English verb phrase respectively. 
5.0 Data analysis and discussion 
5.1 NPE as a dialect 
As far as the simple verbs are concerned, the data demonstrated that NPE’s 
status is not yet clear. Many of the sentences containing simple verbs and 
other uninflected words cannot be categorically classified as either StdE or 
NPE. Here are examples to illustrate this. 
18) I think uh nineteen eighty nine. (F2) 
19) I understand Pidgin English. (F10) 
20) We believe God. (K1) 
21) I do my service last year. (K6) 
22) We call them cleaner messenger. (N5) 
There is no linguistic evidence to classify examples 18 to 22 as either StdE 
or NPE.  In fact, they can be classified as both. Apart from the fact that the 
verbs think, understand and believe in these examples are shared by both 
codes, all the other words in examples 18 to 22 are shared by both codes. 
For example, the pronouns I and we in the sentences belong to both codes 
just as the adverbial last year in 21 can be found in both StdE and NPE. 
Examples 21 and 22 are a bit different. As I have pointed out earlier, NPE 
does not make use of inflectional morphemes to mark tense or plurality. 
The absence of a past tense inflection in do in examples 21 and the absence 
of a noun inflection to mark plurality in messenger (example 22) are strong 
reasons to consider the examples as NPE sentences. However, it might also 
be the case that the sentences are attempts to use Standard English sen-
tences which have errors that render them non-standard. Like sentences 18 
to 20, therefore, sentences 21 and 22 cannot be categorically regarded as 
either StdE or NPE. Examples such as the ones in 18 to 22 abound in my 
data.  
The question here, however, is whether or not this evidence is enough to 
regard NPE as a dialect of English; especially when we can argue that sen-
tences like 21 and 22 are either non-standard English or educated learners’ 
varieties of NPE.

5.2 NPE as a language 
The judgements of NUGs about NPE prompt sentences, the clustering of 
verb phrases in their responses and the constellation of features criterial of 
either StdE or NPE suggest that NPE is best treated as a language. 
5.2.1 Judgements about NPE prompt sentences 
Out of the 30 NUGs, 23 grouped the prompt sentences given to them into 
different classes. These 23 subjects unanimously agreed that sentences 25 to 
30 (see Appendix I) are NPE sentences although some of them pointed out 
that there were other ways of saying some of them. Such labels as good 
Pidgin English (F1, F4, N1 and N9), correct Pidgin English (F6, K3, N7), 
real Pidgin English (F7) were used to describe these NPE sentences. Simi-
larly, they also classified some of the sentences as bad, incorrect or wrong 
Pidgin English. None of these 23 subjects classified sentences 1 to 24 as 
NPE sentences although they said some of the sentences (i.e. sentences 1 to 
24) are standard while some are ‘bad English’ or non-standard English 
(Appendix I). An example of this sort of judgement is found in excerpt 1:

Pidgin English. 
 
The subjects were not only able to separate English sentences from NPE 
ones, they were also able to distinguish between ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ 
NPE sentences. This is a pointer to the fact that NPE is seen as a separate 
language by these subjects. 
5.2.2 Clustering of NPE complex verb phrases 
In order to show the extent to which there are blocks of StdE complex verb 
phrases and blocks of NPE complex verb phrases, two steps were taken: (1) 
the first complex NPE verb phrase used by each subject in the data was ex-
amined and (2) the probability of runs of NPE complex verb phrases or runs

of StdE complex verb phrases occurring by chance was tested with a simple 
Runs Test, a non-parametric randomization test available on Minitab. The 
verb is at the centre of the clause and its pattern of clustering especially 
when two related codes are involved is crucial in arriving at how the codes 
could be treated. 
Presented in Table 1 is the pattern of the use of NPE and StdE complex 
verb phrases by the informants. All the interviewees begin with Standard 
English. Generally speaking, the first VP in NPE appears between the 6th 
VP and the 116th VP. The subjects differ in terms of when the first NPE 
verb phrase occurs in their responses (Table 1). While the first NPE verb 
phrase used by K4 is the 11th VP, the first used by K6 is the 116th VP. Simi-
larly, the first NPE verb phrase used by F6 is the 24th VP while the first 
NPE VP used by N10 is the 9th VP (Table 1).

Table 1: Rank order of first NPE 
A comparison of the three regions shows some variation in terms of when 
the first NPE VP was used in each region (Table 1). The first 23 complex 
verb phrases in the responses of all Ife subjects are StdE VPs. The first NPE 
VP in this region is the 24th VP used by F6. In Kano the first 10 complex 
VPs in the responses of all the subjects are StdE VPs while in Nsukka, the 
first 5 complex verb phrases of all the subjects are StdE verb phrases. The 
first NPE verb phrase in Nsukka is the 6th VP used by N8 (Tables 1). This 
means that Nsukka subjects started using NPE earlier in the interview than 
Ife and Kano subjects. This implies that Nsukka subjects are more comfort-
able and receptive towards the use of NPE.

The density of NPE demonstrated in the three regions also supports the 
clustering of NPE complex verb phrases. In all three places, the informants 
speak much more StdE in interviews than NPE (Table 2). However, more 
NPE VPs were used in Nsukka while the lowest number of NPE VPs was 
used in Kano. The rate of NPE verb phrases recorded in Nsukka was the 
highest of all the three regions with the lowest coming from Kano. While 
the rates of NPE verb phrases per thousand words in Ife and Kano are simi-
lar, the rate of use of NPE VPs in Nsukka is considerably higher, roughly 
double the rate in the other two locations (Table 2).

Table 2: Rate per 1000 words of StdE and NPE verb phrases 
 
The explanation for this is almost certainly historical. NPE is generally be-
lieved to have started in the Eastern part of the country and from there it 
spread to other parts of the country. Today, the majority of people who 
speak NPE as a mother tongue appear to be from this region and the highest 
proportion of literary works written in NPE come from this part of the 
country. 
I present below the results of the probability of runs of NPE complex 
verb phrases or runs of StdE complex verb phrases calculated. 
In the responses of 26 out of the 30 NUGs used, the probability of these 
runs occurring by chance is as close as possible to 0.0 There is no doubt, 
therefore, that these 26 speakers make sharp switches from StdE to NPE, 
rather than mixing the two codes at random. The probabilities of runs were 
not computed for the four informants (F2, K5, K8 and K10), who used al-
most no NPE during the interviews (Table 3).

StdE complex verb phrases cluster with other StdE complex verb phrases 
while NPE complex verb phrases cluster with NPE complex verb phrases. 
Here I present StdE extracts first and then NPE ones to illustrate this clus-
tering of complex verb phrases.

In Ife here, however, from em, you know, the – I don’t 
  1 
know – Ife should be the cradle of Yorubas like has popu- 
  2 
larly been said. It has turned to a cliché now, being the  
  3 
cradle of Yoruba land. But nevertheless, over time you 
  4 
discover that situations in Ife, the social life of Ife have  
  5 
been characterised with violence, you understand? And in 
  6 
An area where you have violence, protest here and there, 
  7 
people not willing to agree, people not willing to really 
  8 
dialogue, definitely you understand that progress, deve- 
  9 
lopment will be slowed down if not in ebb completely. 
10 
And that’s why Ibadan has continued to move from  
11 
strength to strength. If you were in Ibadan about two  
12 
years ago, and you now go back to Ibadan today, 
13 
definitely it might take a lot of time to locate where your  
14 
father’s house is and things like that because of so many 
15 
developments that has taken place. That is just it.

I foresee a situation whereby, in future, there could be  
 
some degrees of uniformity in the way we speak Nigerian 
 
Pidgin English because it looks like uh people are now 
 
Writing- I mean they are now committing it to writing.  
 
What can you say about that? 
 
N5 
In fact – In fact, I was going to argue, seriously, with you  
  1 
there. The greatest problem we will have with the 
  2 
Uniform Pidgin English, it is how do you write it?  
  3 
How do you write it? You see, the way you string 
  4 
your words, the grammar, the tenses, everything depends 
  5 
On the speaker. There are no rules and you know, written 
  6 
word, even Yoruba it has rules, Igbo has rules. There are  
  7 
places where you dot the ‘i’ on top of the ‘o’, places 
  8 
you dot the ‘i’ below the ‘o’. In Pidgin English, there are 
  9 
No rules. You make them up as you go along. Now, how 
10 
can you communicate with that kind of stuff? How 
11 
can a lawyer go to court and make a statement in 
12 
Pidgin English that the judge will understand that it means  
13 
a particular thing? You know, the way he stresses the  
14 
word, even the way he strings his words can completely 
15 
Change the meaning.

There are 9 complex StdE verb phrases in 2A and 8 in 2B and nothing 
marks these complex VPs as NPE. The pattern here is such that we have a 
constellation of StdE complex verb phrases without a single occurrence of 
NPE complex verb phrases. More importantly, in each of these excerpts 
there are other features criterial of StdE with which StdE complex verb 
phrases cluster. The first of these features is the use of inflectional markers 
by the subjects to show plurality or tense. For instance, there is a plural in-
flectional suffix –s in the words situations and developments in 2A (Lines 5 
and 16) and tenses and rules in 2B (Lines 5 and 7). Similarly, concord and 
possession were marked with inflectional markers in the examples. The 
marking of concord is another criterial feature of StdE which is common in 
the extract above. For instance, in 2B we have it means (L.13), he stresses 
(L.14) and he strings (L.15). Also, in 2A, we have he works. All these ex-
amples show that there is concord between the third person singular sub-
jects and the simple present form of the verb that follows them. The aux-
iliary BE is followed by the {en} form in the passive as in have been cha-
racterised in 2A (Lines 5–6). Lastly, the perfective auxiliary HAVE is fol-
lowed by the past participle form of the verb take in has taken (Line 16 of 
2A). All these are features criterial of StdE and their occurrences in the ex-
cerpts used indicate that they are clearly StdE. 
Just as there are responses which are completely in StdE, there are oth-
ers which are completely in NPE. I present below excerpts 3A and 3B in 
which the verb phrases are clearly NPE ones.

There are 16 complex NPE verb phrases in 3A while K2 used 5 NPE com-
plex verb phrases in 3B. In each of these two texts, there is no occurrence of 
a single StdE complex verb phrases. This pattern is similar to the way my 
subjects behaved in their responses (with the exception of F2, K1 and K10).  
Although many words in the excerpts are shared by both StdE and NPE, 
excerpts 3A and 3B demonstrate a clear use of NPE in that there are other 
criterial NPE features present in them. There is, for instance, the use of the 
pronoun am and the use of the particle na. Am as a third person singular 
pronoun in 3A is criterial of NPE and can occupy only the object position 
as it has no subject form in NPE. In NPE them can occupy either the subject 
or object position as we see in them dey spend so much time argue over so 
many thing (4C, L.6–7) where it functions as a subject. Thus, this clause is 
perfectly formed in NPE. In addition to the use of the particles na and o, 
such words as wetin, hin and wey which are criterial of NPE are common in 
their responses. These excerpts demonstrate that the criterial features of 
StdE tend to cluster with other StdE features, and the criterial features of 
NPE tend to cluster with the NPE features whenever they appear and they 
rarely mix up together. This clustering of grammatical features of NPE 
makes it distinguishable from StdE whenever such a cluster occurs.  
5.2.3 Focusing of code choice 
The pattern of switches NUGs make between StdE and NPE is also crucial 
and can provide insights on how NPE is treated by them. Here are three 
excerpts that illustrate the pattern of switches across all three regions.

So, it has played a major role. It allows you to communicate

anywhere you find yourself in Nigeria. In fact, there’s no place 
  2 
 
in Nigeria where you will get to and you and you will not see 
  3 
 
a single person who cannot understand English. So, I think it has 
  4 
 
served a great role in bridging the gap in communication. An

En, of course because I can’t really say that I am very fluent 
  1 
 
in speaking the language but for example, I live with people, 
  2 
 
I school with people that can speak the language. And I acquired 
  3 
 
a little bit knowledge about how to speak it. Yeah. For example, 
  4 
 
when somebody wants to go to markets. I dey waka…. Ha, my 
  5

we dey fit say we dey use our own this thing, our own em,

our own Pidgin English, no grammar, grammar per se, we 
   4 
 
are not doing better than they. So, Germany too, they don’t use 
   5 
 
this…that’s English language in teaching in their classes. They 
   6 
 
don’t use it. Not only them, even the em- There is another, 
   7 
 
country Japan, they don’t use it but these are world-class 
   8 
 
countries. That’s when you are talking about world power,  
   9 
 
they’ve gone far. So, they are able to pass this message to their 
 10 
 
people using their own dialects, what they can comprehend. To 
 11 
 
tell you the truth, if I were taught with Pidgin for my first 
 12 
 
degree, I for come have first class because all those, big big 
 13 
 
grammar wey them dey carry from US and uh London 
 14 
 
come dey give us here, them for break am to the level wey 
 15 
 
we oneself go comprehend.  
 16 
Excerpts 4 to 6 show that the subjects made clear switches between codes. 
The first 11 VPs in excerpt 4 are StdE complex verb phrases after which F6 
switched to NPE and used 4 NPE complex verb phrases without any StdE 
complex verb phrases between them. K6 also started with StdE in excerpt 5 
and used 3 StdE complex verb phrases and these verb phrases were fol-
lowed by 4 NPE complex verb phrases. N10 in excerpt 6 used 5 NPE com-
plex verb phrases after which he used 9 StdE complex verb phrases. After 
these 9 StdE complex verb phrases, N10 used 5 NPE complex verb phrases 
successively.

Apart from this pattern of sequence of VPs in both codes, NPE complex 
verb phrases appear with other features of NPE and StdE complex verb 
phrases appear with other features of StdE in the these excerpts. For in-
stance, there is a verb inflection -s in allows (line 2, excerpt 4) and this 
marks concord between the 3rd person singular pronoun it and the verb al-
lows in this excerpt. Similarly, them in line 2 of excerpt 6 is an NPE pro-
noun by virtue of occurring in the subject position in Them dey yan. Sharp 
switching matters. This is because when there is sharp switching; criterial 
features of a particular code tend to cluster and this clustering makes the 
code distinguishable from the other code. 
6.0 Conclusion 
The purpose of this paper was to explore whether NPE is best seen as a di-
alect of English or a distinct language. The two codes are sharply distinct and 
judgements favour NPE as a separate language. Also, their verbal grammars 
are quite different.  Thus, from structural and grammatical point of view, 
NPE is a separate language different from English. Although there are some 
sentences which can belong to both StdE and NPE in my data, many of such 
sentences can be regarded as educated speakers’ learner varieties of NPE. 
Two factors suggest that NPE is best seen as a separate language. Firstly, as 
noted above, the grammar is sharply different as seen in the difference in 
complex verb phrases. The complex VP is either a StdE complex verb phrase 
or an NPE complex verb phrase and there cannot be a mismatch between the 
two. Secondly, NPE complex verb phrases cluster not only with other NPE 
complex verb phrases but also with other features criterial of NPE. Similarly, 
StdE complex verb phrases cluster with other StdE complex verb phrases and 
other criterial features of StdE, and this enables one to observe a constellation 
of features of either StdE or NPE. In the responses of the subjects, either of 
these codes appeared in blocks such that it is possible for one to say a block 
is in NPE and another is in StdE; this is like the behaviour of bilinguals mov-
ing from one language to the other.
