Abstract 
 
 
The population of Nigeria is not only large, but is also expanding by the passage of time. It is therefore significant that 
many Nigerians speak Nigerian Pidgin English. This study examines how Nigerian Pidgin English contributes to the 
development of the country as it gains recognition and operates across facets of nation-hood. When language is used to 
impinge on the value-system of society through the transmission of information and consciousness, then nation-building 
is in operation. The literature is replete with critical perspectives on the position of Nigerian Pidgin English in 
multilingual Nigeria. Hinging on the Independent Parallel Development Theory and the Neutralist Perspective, this study 
concludes that Nigerian Pidgin English contributes to the building of Nigeria as it is used to convey useful information 
for national integration and sustainable development. 
Keywords: Nigerian Pidgin, nation-building, Independent Parallel Development Theory, Neutralist Perspective

INTRODUCTION 
The literature of sociolinguistics elucidates the 
significance of language to human existence. For 
example, Charles Chukwuma Montanya [1] notes that 
“one of the most important differences between man 
and animals is man‟s ability to speak and make others 
understand him. Language is the only means through 
which this is achieved in man‟s life. Language is the 
medium or vehicle for conveying ideas, a system of 
arbitrary vocal symbol based on social cooperation; the 
totality of meaningful utterances in a given society …” 
This study examines the roles of Nigerian Pidgin 
English in the building of the Nigerian nation. The 
study makes an overview of multilingual Nigeria to 
locate how Nigerian Pidgin English is placed in terms 
of recognition, acceptability and functions.  
 
Nigerian Pidgin in Multilingual Nigeria 
The Education Ordinance of 1882 entrenched 
English as the language of instruction in Nigeria, and in 
1896, the Certification System was introduced. Thus, 
Credit Pass in English became a compulsion in schools. 
The Article 114(1) of the Littleton Constitution 
legislated English as an Official Language. People had 
to obtain certificate in English to thrive in their careers. 
Although arguments for the use of Nigerian Pidgin 
English as Nigeria‟s National Language abound in the 
literature, English continues to dominate other 
languages in the country as far as significant spheres of 
nationhood is concerned. The use of Nigerian Pidgin 
English in different facets of life, is not a product of 
legislation. Rather, it is because of its communicative 
potentials in the Nigerian speech community where 
Nigerian Pidgin English is part of the socio-cultural 
nuances of the people.  
 
Attitudinal problems have for long bedeviled 
the prospects of Nigerian Pidgin English in terms of 
legislative positions on its functionality in nationhood.  
Since Nigerian Pidgin English can facilitate the 
integration needed for development, it is necessary for 
language planning in Nigeria to explore the language 
for nation-building by legislating roles for it in 
important 
spheres 
of 
nationhood: 
education, 
administration, media, etc. It is through sincere, goal-
driven language planning that the developmental 
potentials of Nigerian Pidgin English can be explored 
maximally for nation-building. This view corroborates 
Koul [2] who opines that language planning is “a 
deliberate 
attempt 
in 
resolving 
language-related 
problems necessary for the development of a particular 
language.” For Akindele and Adegbite cited in 
Egwuogu [3] language planning is “a set of deliberate 
activities systematically designed to select from, 

 
                                                             Acheoah John Emike et al.; Saudi J. Humanities Soc Sci, Nov. 2019; 4(11): 720-725

organize and develop the language resources of a 
community in order to enhance the utilization of such 
resources for development. Language planning is 
necessitated by the multilingual states … to integrate 
the region or country and promote encompassing 
development.” The present roles that Nigerian Pidgin 
English performs unconstitutionally in Nigeria implies 
that if the roles of the language is spelt out via 
legislation, and developed via corpus and status 
planning, it will play vital roles in nation-building. For 
Nigerian Pidgin English to perform extensive roles in 
nation-building, its corpora have to be developed and 
standardized. Commenting on corpus and status 
planning, Egwogu Chinyere [3] submits that “language 
planning can be done at two levels: status and corpus 
planning. While status planning deals with assignment 
of roles to either broaden or narrow their scope, corpus 
planning deals with language development. It ensures 
standardization and codification. Therefore, some 
features include:  
 
Graphization i.e. standization of the writing 
system; 
 
Modernization i.e. formation and inclusion of 
new vocabulary to keep pace with new 
discoveries, inventions and innovations.” 
 
According to David Esizimetor and Francis 
Egbokhare [4] “Nigeria has a population of more than 
162 million people (July 2011 United Nations estimate) 
scattered across its 923.768 square kilometers of 
swamps, forests and savannahs. The country is an 
amalgamation of ethnically diverse groups of people 
speaking well over 500 different languages.” David 
Esizimetor and Francis Egbokhare [4] also note that 
“The Portuguese were the first group of Europeans to 
visit and explore coastal Nigeria, especially around the 
area now known geographically as the Niger Delta. 
They started trading with the people of the region from 
as early as 1469 AD. They established strong 
diplomatic ties between some of the great kingdoms of 
the region and Portugal. They established schools and 
churches where they taught Portuguese and the 
doctrines of Christianity in the region. And this brought 
their language close to languages of the Niger Delta for 
an extended period of time. This, of course became 
crucial to the evolution of the Naija, which started out 
as a Portuguese-based pidgin in the Niger Delta” NP is 
so dominant in certain parts of Nigeria; it is creolized in 
some parts of the country. There are no evidences that 
less use of NP in certain parts of Nigeria has made such 
parts develop more than other parts. The use of 
Nigerian Pidgin English in different facets of life in 
Nigeria essentially makes communication easier and 
more effective. Nigerian Pidgin English is getting better 
recognition in Nigeria as noted by Jalaludeen Ibrahim 
[5] who posits that “in the past, NPE was regarded as 
“unruly jargon”. “Vulgar” and “broken English” mainly 
associated with a socio-economically deprived set of 
people. The reason for this negative perception was in 
connection to its origin as mainly a trade language 
which distanced its speakers from the speakers of 
language of the educated class, the lexifier English. 
This implies that the typical speakers of NPE were 
those who had little or no formal education.”  
 
Theoretical Anchorage 
This study hinges on bipartite theoretical 
frameworks in contending that Nigerian Pidgin English 
plays vital roles in the growth and development of the 
nation (nation-building): the Neutralist Perspective; and 
the 
Independent 
Parrallel 
Development 
Theory. 
According to the Neutralist Perspective, Nigerian 
Pidgin should be a National Language due to its 
neutrality, communicative potential in casual discourses 
and potency in national cohesion. The Independent 
Parallel Development Theory on the other hand, 
postulates that the common ancestry which languages 
have is a facilitator of their functions in terms of 
national 
cohesion 
and 
societal 
transformation. 
According to the theory, languages have common Indo-
European ancestry given their corpus similarities. The 
theory views the socio-cultural affinity of African 
countries as an evidence of the compatibility of 
Nigerian Pidgin among Africans [5].  
 
The Instrumentality of Nigerian Pidgin in Nation-
building 
Nation-building is essentially the development 
of a nation or country. It is a cross-facet (political, 
economic, 
technological, 
educational, 
etc.) 
growth/development, and it is informed by conscious 
efforts. But without national cohesion or integration, 
national development or nation-building cannot be 
sustained. Politically, the value-system is expected to 
develop before it can be said that a nation is making 
political progress. In this era of global insecurity, any 
language that unites the people of a country can be 
explored for peaceful co-existence of the country. 
Nigerian Pidgin English contributes to the building of 
Nigeria in different ways. Consider the following: 
 
National Cohesion 
Peace and security of life and property are 
prerequisites for nation-building. Governance cannot 
thrive in an atmosphere of chaos and insecurity. It is on 
record that West Africa is among the world‟s most 
unstable regions. Nigeria and other African nations 
have been plagued by so much insecurity that nation-
building has become elusive. Language has to be used 
to sensitize, educate, and unite war-torn nations. Within 
the context of this paper, Nigerian Pidgin English 
promotes national integration. In the different crisis that 
plague Nigeria, Nigerian Pidgin English is used to 
sustain brotherhood via different radio and television 
programmes. The Niger Delta crisis was not an 
exception. The crisis in the Niger Delta lingered until 
2009 when Presidential amnesty was granted to the 
militants in the Niger Delta. Through Nigerian Pidgin 
English Programmes in radio stations in Nigeria, 
physical, 
emotional, 
psychological and religious 

 
                                                             Acheoah John Emike et al.; Saudi J. Humanities Soc Sci, Nov. 2019; 4(11): 720-725

violence were curbed. This is essentially nation-
building. Nigerian Pidgin English provides the 
decorum, national cohesion, peace, justice, solidarity 
and brotherhood which Nigeria is in dire need of.  
 
Population of Speakers 
Many 
Nigerians 
contend 
for 
the 
institutionalization of Nigerian Pidgin English as 
National Language because its use across domains of 
national life is becoming widespread. It is not surprising 
that the language is becoming more and more 
communicatively potent in the Nigerian speech 
community; it is a product of inter-regional, mutual 
trade relations, and this empowers it with the potency to 
perform integrative functions in society. Indeed, 
integration is the source of sustainable development in 
any society. Temitope Abiodun Balogun [5] also 
submits that “a source had it that „Pidgin‟ (especially in 
West Africa) arose from the contact between the 
Chinese and the European traders and such was a 
mispronunciation of the word “business” by the 
Chinese [12]. Another account has it that it came from 
the Portuguese word „OCUPACIAO,‟ which means 
„occupation‟.  Pidgin is also said to resemble or closely 
related to a Hebrew word Pidjom which means „barter‟ 
[13]. It is of particular interest to note that Pidgin has to 
do with trade or business, contact or migration between 
two hitherto cultural sets of people.” Concerning the 
population of speakers of Nigerian Pidgin English, 
David Esizimetor and Francis Egbokhare [4] submit 
that “Current estimates show that around 5 million 
people speak Naija as first language while over 75 
million people use it as a second language in Nigeria 
and in Nigeria Diaspora communities in Europe, 
America and other parts of the world …” The 
implication of having very many speakers of Nigerian 
Pidgin English is that a large number of the productive 
age speak it and translate the use of the language into 
nation-building in their various endeavours. Temitope 
Abiodun Balogun [5] submits that “a research 
conducted by Okon [14] even shows that members of 
university tend to use it excitedly, for example: 
Femi, O boy which lecture we get now? 
Na ENG 309 
One no kuku sabi whether di man go come 
 
In English translation: 
Tunde: Are we having lectures now? 
Femi: Yes, we are having ENG 309. 
Tunde: Are you sure the lecturer will be 
coming? 
Femi: No, I am not sure.” 
 
A Linking Language 
The extrinsic features of Nigerian Pidgin 
English enables it to link the various ethnic groups in 
the country with the socio-cultural values that define 
their day-to-day lifestyle. We hold the view that 
Fishman‟s parameters for language classification [6] 
succinctly captures the extrinsic (socio-pragmatic) 
features of Nigeria Pidgin English: 
 
Vitality – seen in the existence of a living 
community of its speakers. This is a 
criterion often applied to distinguish 
languages that are alive as against some 
others that are described as dead …; 
 
Historicity – as seen in the existence of a 
group of people who, in addition to their 
social, political, religious or ethnic ties, 
also see their language as the bonding 
medium of their common ancestry …; 
 
Autonomy – the subjective feeling (when 
strongly assertive) by a people that their 
language is unique i.e. different from 
some other language whatever contrary 
scientific view a linguist may hold 
concerning their speech form …”   
 
Apart from deriving its vocabulary from 
English, Nigerian Pidgin English derives many of its 
vocabulary items from the major Nigerian languages 
(Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa) and from the Edoid group of 
languages. This makes it easy for it to function not only 
as a linking language, but also as a means of 
communication across domains in Nigeria. Indeed, 
Portuguese also contributes to the lexicon of Nigerian 
Pidgin. Consider the list below which shows Nigerian 
Pidgin English words and their sources [4]:

David Esizimetor and Francis Egbokhare [4] 
also note that “Naija always has many words from

forms. Among the most widely used are: 
-

- 
machis         „matches‟ 
- 
skul fis         „school fees‟ 
- 
soks             „socks‟ 
- 
twins            „twins‟.” 
 
 
Cross-Domain Function 
Although Nigerian Pidgin English is often 
stereotyped and described as „Pidgin English‟ or 
„Broken English‟, it is accepted by most people as a 
very 
useful 
language 
for 
public 
enlightenment 
campaigns, radio and television programs, inter-ethnic 
communication, 
commercial 
advertising, 
sitcoms, 
stand-up comedies, popular music, religious music and 
for conducting common everyday business transactions 
in many parts of the country … 
 
The fact that Nigerian Pidgin English is 
commonly used in radio programmes, is a positive 
development. Through the cross-domain functions of 
Nigerian Pidgin English, goods and services are 
enjoyed by Nigerians. For example, the language is 
used for presenting information for the use of medical 
and household products. Without such information, 
private and public lives will be in jeopardy. Many terms 
that are not understood in English are expressed in 
Nigerian Pidgin English to facilitate the dissemination 
of information for nation-building. Obi Edith Ifeyinwa 
[7] presents radio programmes in Nigerian Pidgin 
English:

LITERARY POTENTIALS 
Literature is an asset to society because its 
educative and corrective roles cannot be quantified. 
Nigerian Pidgin English is emerging in the literary 
canon. In this regard, it fosters nation-building; in the 
sense that committed art speaks to society for the good 
of society. While the status of the language has 
improved tremendously as a language that can be used 
for serious purposes, only a small body of literature 
exists in it. There are ongoing efforts among local 
linguists and writers to see that this aspect of the 
language is developed especially since 2009 when the 
Naija Languej Akedemi (NLA) proposed a harmonized 
orthography for writing the language and adopted Naija 
as the name for the language that was hitherto known as 
Nigerian Pidgin [8]. Jalaludeen Ibrahim [8] also submits 
that “the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) now 
recognize NPE in its members literary works as many 
books and poetry volumes have been published in NPE. 
Some of the notable works include: Eriata Oribhabor‟s 
If Yu Hie Se A De Prizin, Ezenwa-Ohaeto‟s I wan Bi 
President, Tunde Fatunde‟s No Country and Ola 
Rotimi‟s Grip Am.” It is obvious given the issues 
discussed in sections 4.1 to 4.5, that Nigerian Pidgin 
English cannot be isolated from nation-building in the 
Nigerian context.  
 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Although the roles which Nigerian Pidgin 
English plays in the cohesive building of Nigeria, are 
not entrenched via legislation, they are incredible and 
worthy of scholarly and legislative attention. This study 
views nation-building as a multi-facetted paradigm shift 
that is sustained for the good of the populace. Nigerian 
Pidgin English is so potent in conveying messages that

its relegation in certain spheres of nationhood, is 
unacceptable.  
 
It seems illogical to advocate for the use of 
Nigerian Pidgin English in education, administration, 
international diplomacy and other significant domains 
given the fact that literacy level in it is not satisfactory. 
However, it should be noted that the developmental 
potentials of Nigerian Pidgin English cannot be fully 
realized if literacy level in it is not enhanced. It takes 
adequate literacy (people‟s proficiency in reading, 
writing and speaking) in Nigerian Pidgin English to 
entrench it in nationhood. In Nigeria, literacy level in 
English is higher than literacy level in Nigerian Pidgin 
English, and this sociolinguistic situation gives English 
edge over Nigerian Pidgin English. It is not difficult to 
attain satisfactory literacy level in Nigerian Pidgin 
English because its internal structure is simple, as noted 
by scholars. For example, Obi Edith Ifeyinwa [7] cites 
Yule who listed the following as the common linguistic 
features of English-based Pidgins:  
1. 
Absence of any complex grammatical morphology 
and a limited vocabulary; 
2. 
Inflectional suffixes such as -s (plural) and -s 
(possessive) on nouns in Standard.    
3. 
English are rare in Pidgins, for example, „a lot of 
cars‟ is translated as „plenti plenty car‟. 
4. 
Functional morphemes often take the place of 
inflectional morphemes found in the source 
language. For example, instead of changing the 
form of „you‟ to „your‟ as in the English phrase, 
„your book‟, English-based Pidgin uses a form like 
„book bilong you‟… Again Pidgin language 
usually uses reduplication as intensifiers or 
modifying adverbs. For instance, in Standard 
English (SE) „The soup is very palatable‟ is 
translated in Nigerian Pidgin (NP) as „The supu 
swit well well (reduplication).”  
 
Nigerian Pidgin English, like languages in 
general, is important to society. Dada [9] submits that 
“language is a unique property that belongs to the 
human race. It is a means of communication between 
two or more people and to a very large extent, the 
development of man politically, socially, economically, 
etc., depends on the use of language. Indeed, language 
permeates all aspects of human endeavor. Language is 
an integral part of culture, a reflection of many features 
of a given culture thus, like culture itself, it is a leader 
of behavior, which can be enhanced through direct or 
indirect contact. The formal and functional complexity 
of language is such a distinctive human trait that many 
scholars think the designation “homo loquat” (man the 
speaking animal) to be a better way of identifying the 
species than any other simple criterion (Such as tool 
using) that has been suggested.” Some vital roles which 
Nigerian Pidgin English plays in Nigeria have been 
discussed in this paper. Therefore, negative attitudes 
towards the language should be discouraged. Scholars 
contend that language attitudes impinge on the status 
and functions of a language. For example, Adegbija 
[10] submits that “attitudes towards languages are 
motivated by several factors including their socio-
economic value, their status-raising potentials, their 
perceived instrumental value, their perceive esteem, 
their perceived functions or roles in the nation, their 
numerical strength, the perceived political and 
economic power of its speakers, their use in the official 
domains, their educational value, etc. Generally, 
positive attitudes, covert or overt, are developed 
towards a language that is perceived to have value in all 
these different areas … Conversely, negative attitudes, 
overt or covert, develop towards a language in 
proportion to its lack of function or narrowing or 
narrowing of its distribution in registers.”  
 
Nigerian 
Pidgin 
English 
fosters 
nation-
building because of its esteemed position in the psyche 
of many Nigerians – the natives of the environment 
where Nigerian Pidgin English originated. Language 
interacts with its environment. Thus, English cannot 
dislodge the functions which Nigerian Pidgin English 
performs in the country. This submission corroborates 
Einar Haugen‟s view cited by Leena Vanha‟s [11]. 
According to Einar Haugen, ecolinguistics or language 
ecology is “the study of interactions between any given 
language and its environments…”  For Leena Vanha 
“an ecological perspective asserts that the learner‟s 
environment is full of potential meanings that slowly 
become available for the learner through interaction 
with and within the environment.” Indeed, Nigerian 
Pidgin English embodies the speakers‟ routine. This 
being the case, the language is a credible candidate for 
building the nation in different ramifications.
