Abstract  
Every human interrelationship is surrounded with language. There is no activity of man 
that is devoid of language. Language and man are inseparable the same way life and fresh 
air are. Just like in every other aspect of human endeavours, the role of language in business 
cannot be overestimated. Business transaction is believed to thrive when appropriate 
language use is applied in its day to day activity.  This paper investigated the role language 
plays in business. This study explored how the appropriate use of language can make a 
business to blossom. The geographical location for the study was Ilorin Metropolis. The 
data for the study encompassed the conversation secretly recorded during a business 
transaction between some Igbo traders and their customers. Adding to the data for the study 
included the questionnaire distributed to selected Igbo business dealers and some 
customers at Agaka  and Ọja Tuntun markets, Ilorin Metropolis, Kwara State. The analysis 
of the data for the study engaged the Monogenetic or reflexification theory formulated by 
Hugo Schuchardt in the late 19th century and was popularized in the late 1950s and early 
1960s by Taylor (1961). The outcome of the study included that though language as a 
phenomenon plays vital role in all human existence, yet application of the appropriate 
language within the right context, time and place benefits absolutely. 
Key Words: Language, Pidgin, Igbo, Business, Ilorin 
Introduction 
Life of man on earth would have made no much difference without language. It is language 
that pilots the activities of man, in the sense that it is what determines what to do, what to 
say, how to do/say, and where to go. Without language, life would have been static just 
like plant on the soil without sense of direction. Humans in all their activities in life employ 
language in every facet of life. It is used for communication, to instruct, direct, command, 
to educate, admonish as well as to transact business. In the business world today, the way 
language is used varies from person to person, group to group, place to place, and for one 
reason or the other; and such variation emanates as a result of who is involved and where 
the business transaction is taking place. Variation in language use sometime may not occur 
when the business dealers are from the same language community where there is mutual 
intelligibility. However, if the dealers are from different language communities, there may 
be need for language variation in their communication for the parties to have a good rapport 
in their business transactions.  In our contemporary world, there are many languages in use 

93 
 
and such include English language, Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, French, and Nigeria Pidgin 
English etc.  Of all the languages that abound, this paper focuses to illuminate how the use 
of pidgin as a means of interpersonal interaction could be used to promote the smooth 
running of business outside one’s native language domain, using Igbo business men in 
Ilorin metropolis as our  case study. Ilorin is the largest city and the state capital of Kwara 
State in Western Nigeria. As of 2006 census, it had a population of 777,667, making it the 
6th largest city in Nigeria by population.  Ilorin was founded by the Yoruba, one of the 
three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, in 1450. Ilorin is blessed with several economic 
yielding establishments. Among the notable companies include, Global Soap and 
Detergent Industries Nigeria Limited, the International Tobacco Company, Dangote Flour 
Mills, Tuyil Pharmaceutical Company, KAMWIL, Golden Confectionate Food Industries, 
Chellaram Motor-Cycle Assembly plants, and Rajrab Pharmaceuticals. In addition the 
above mentioned companies are some other business areas and markets located at different 
directions of the metropolis; such business places encompass Agaka ,  Baboko, Oja Tuntun, 
Pata, Oja Oba, Ibrahim Taiwo Road etc. 
Decamp (1987:175) quoted by Abdullahi-Idiagbon (2010, p.2), describes pidgin as 
“an incidental communicative language within a multilingual setting which is the native 
language of nobody.” Its vocabulary according to Decamp is donated by the socio-
politically dominant language in the original contact situation, most especially, with the 
European imperialists. It is a contact vernacular, normally not the native language of any 
of its speakers. Pidgin according to Hymes (1971) has been traditionally classified as 
deviant dialect of a standard language, usually Europe, with English, French, Portuguese, 
Spanish and Dutch the most frequent. 
 Holm (1988) sees Pidgin as a reduced language that results from extended contact 
between groups of people with no language in common; it evolves when there is need for 
means of verbal communication. Pidgin is a simplified version of a language that develops 
as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have one language 
in common. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade or in any situation 
requiring communication where both groups speak languages different from the languages 
of the environment in which they belong to, that is to say that there is no common language 
between the groups.  
Basically, Pidgin is simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is 
constructed impromptu, or by convention. Pidgin may be built from words, sound or body 
language from multiple other languages and cultures. It allows people who have no 
common language to communicate with each other. 
 
Pidgin Development 
Reference to the existence of pidgin can be dated back to the middle age and the 
earliest studies in pidgin and creole can be traced to the 15th century BC according to Todd 
(1992, p.1). Decamp (1971, p.31) recognized Schuchardt as the greatest of the early 
scholars and the founding father of the field. According to Romain (1988, p. 4), Schuchardt 
is more generally known for his contribution in the field of pidgin and creole in a series of 
paper entitled Krolische Studien published in the 1880s. 

94 
 
 
The initial development of a Pidgin typically involves a continued and consistent 
contact between the different languages as well as having a need to communicate between 
the native speakers of these diverse languages. More so, absence of widespread proficiency 
in widespread accessible inter-language could usher in pidgin (https://en.m.wikipedia.org). 
When two languages come in contact, pidgin does not evolve suddenly to live 
forever, rather, it develops gradually. Todd (1992, p. 51) informs that there are essentially 
four phases to the development of a Pidgin to Creole among which two that are relevant to 
this study would be discussed. The two phases include: 
(i) Phase 1 – Marginal Contact 
(ii) Phase 2 – Period of Nativization 
 
PHASE 1 – Marginal Contact 
 
“Pidgin language can be found at all levels and all kinds of situation as long as 
communication is needed” Todd (1992, p. 51). For instance, guides on tourism often 
simplify their language when showing foreign visitors around; Hostellers simplify their 
language when dealing with other Hostellers whose command of English is limited. 
Todd (1992) accounts that English speaking sailors, traders and adventurers who first 
went to Africa, Asia, America or Australia must have used simplified and limited form 
of English in order to communicate. 
 
Marginal phase of a Pidgin is only adequate for rudimentary forms of 
communication. It is largely supplemented by gesture. Discussion is limited to tangible 
objects especially those in the immediate vicinity. Marginal contact of a Pidgin has limited 
value as it is temporarily used. Todd (1992, p. 57) said “It is likely that since the sixteenth 
century, several English Pidgins have come into existence and died out.” There are only 
two options for marginal Pidgin, it either disappear or expand (become more useful by the 
expansion of its resources). 
 
PHASE 2 – Period of Nativization 
 
When a Pidgin survives to expand it is said to have moved to be nativized. That is 
some groups have accepted it as their primary language. It usually happens in a multilingual 
nation like Nigeria. Todd(1992, p. 52) suggests that the expansion of Pidgin is facilitated 
by its development  in a multilingual region and its use is not so much in non-native to 
native contact as in contacts between native inhabitants speaking mutually unintelligible 
languages. 
 
At first, Pidgin was inadequate for the expression of a very wide range of human 
experience. As it became more widely used, its vocabulary increased, and as its vocabulary 
increased it became more useful. In other to express ideas, people who have insufficient 
competence in a language tend to import some morphological processes in the lexicon of 
the pidginized language. Example includes Republication and item borrowing. 
 
Reduplication occurs in all English Pidgins. In Nigeria Pidgin for example, 
reduplication is usually total. For instance, 
 
Word 
Pidgin 
Reduplication 
Gloss 

95 
 
Fast 
Play 
Sick 
Talk 
Walk 
Lie 
Now 
So 
Quick 
Fast fast 
Play play 
Siki siki 
Tọkị tọkị 
Waka waka 
Lie lie 
Now now 
Na so so 
Quick quick 
Very fast 
To be very playful 
To appear sickly always  
Persistent  chatter or a prattler 
To always be out and about 
Liar 
Immediately 
That is how 
Quickly 
 
Item borrowing from indigenous languages is not limited to Pidgin, it occurs even 
in developed languages like French and English etc. Some words tend to find their way 
into Pidgin, usually by native speakers substituting them with lexical items from their 
native languages. Examples of such words include: 
 
Word 
Gloss 
Source Language  
Oga 
Oyinbo 
Akara 
Biko 
Boss  
White-man 
Beans cake  
Please 
Yoruba 
Yoruba 
Yoruba 
Igbo  
 
Word compounding is also attested in the Nigeria Pidgin. It is the combination of two 
words       to form or derive a new word, especially nouns. For example: 
Mammy + Water =  mammywater 
Goddess + Water  =Water goddess 
Bush + man = bushman 
An uncivilized person 
Big + man = bigman 
A rich man 
Dead + body =  deadbody 
A corpse 
 
Characteristics of Pidgin  
 
Since pidgin is fundamentally a simple form of communication, the grammar and 
phonology are usually as simple as possible. Decamp (1971), Hymes (1971) and Hudson 
(1990) summarized the characteristics of pidgins as follows:  
 
i. Elimination of grammatical devices like inflections, plural markers and tenses.  

96 
 
ii. Ability of a word to have semantic extension i.e. expanded meanings.  
Similarly, pidgin can also possess the following features: 
(1) Uncomplicated clausal structure (e.g. no embedded clauses) e.g, “I wan chop”, 
meaning “I want to eat” 
(2) Reduction of consonant clusters or breaking them with epenthesis e.g., sick - siki, 
carry - cari, work-wok. 
(3) Basic vowels such as (a, e, i, o, u) that is without including features like long vowels 
and diphthongs. 
(4) No tones, such as those found in West African and Asian languages. 
(5) Use of reduplication to represent plural, superlative, and other parts of speech that 
represent the concepts being increased. E.g, “na Ebuka chop pass” meaning “It is 
Ebuka that ate most”, “the girl get plenty plenty jewelries” meaning “the girl has 
too many jewelries”. 
(6) Lack of morphophonemic variation. Unlike English language that has 
morphophonemic variation for past tense marker (e.g, die + d = died, stop + ed = 
stopped, expand + ed = expanded), pidgin does not. Examples, “I don cook since 
morning” meaning “I have cooked since”; “I don de sick since last month’ meaning 
“I have been sick since last month”.; I bin de wait for you” meaning  “have been 
waiting for you”. 
 
Historical Background of the Nigeria Pidgin English 
 
The industrial revolution of 1884 – 1885 in Europe led to the search for raw material 
and the incursion of the Europeans into West Africa. This led to the colonization of most 
African countries and the importation of English language into them. (Isiak 2007). 
 
Since language and culture are interwoven and cannot be separated, most West 
African languages came in contact with the European language (English). In order to 
overcome the problem of language barrier, there came a need to communicate between the 
speakers of the two languages making contact. The then sailors, traders, officials and other 
whites had to simplify their language. Because Nigerian for instance as one of their 
colonies could not gain enough competence in English language due to lack of formal 
exposure in the language, they simply came up with their own version of English language. 
E.g., “I don port” meaning “I have arrived” (Isiak 2007, p. 12-13). 
 
The Europeans along the line engaged into slave trade business with some Africans, 
therefore exposing them to more of Europeans language. The captives that were able to 
return came with another version of English language. All these versions coming together 
became the Nigeria Pidgin English and because it has been maximally accepted and 
transferred from one generation to another, it could be said to some extent to have been 
creolized, especially in the Eastern region of Nigeria (like Port-Harcourt and Delta), where 
most kids now acquire Nigeria English pidgin as their first language. “Research has it that 
around 3 – 5 million Nigerians out of over 143million acquire Pidgin English as their first 
language” (Abdulahi-Idiagbon 2010, p. 50). It can be argued that Nigerians are highly 
acculturative in nature and as such, they have so much acculturated the Europeans’ culture 
and language to the extent that most Nigerian kids today cannot even speak their native 
language.

The Nigeria Pidgin English 
 
Nigeria Pidgin English is a version of English and Nigeria language spoken as a 
kind of lingual Franca across Nigeria and is referred to simply as “Pidgin”, “Broken 
English” or “Broken”. It is estimated that Nigeria Pidgin English is the native language of 
approximately 3 to 5 million people and is a second language for at least another 75million. 
Abdulahi-Idiagbon (2010, p. 52) citing Ihemere (2006, p.296). 
 
Abdullahi-Idiagbon (2010, p. 52) citing Obiechina (1984) gives the following 
variants of the Nigeria Pidgin as:  
1. Bendel Variant: Spoken in places such as Abraka, Wari, Isoko, Sapele, Agbor, 
Itsekiri, Ewu, Effurun, Urohobo, Agbaraha-Oto. 
2. Calabar Variant:  Spoken in Calabar, Cross river, Akwa-Ibom, Kalabari regions. 
3. Kano/Maiduguri Variant:  Spoken in North-East, North-North, North-South, and 
North-West. 
4. Lagos Variant: Spoken in South-West, Eastern part, Southern-Central 
5. Port-Harcourt variant:  Spoken in Port-Harcourt, River, and Regional suburbs. 
A variant is characterized by a preponderant influence of its substrate language on 
the form and usage of that variant, including their pronunciation, spelling, usage and 
meaning beyond the territory of the original speakers. 
 
Abdullahi-Idiagbon (2010, p. 54) states that the Nigeria Pidgin can be classified 
into three and they include: 
i. 
Ordinary Nigeria Pidgin English spoken by the vast majority of Nigeria people. 
For example,  
(a) Abeg give me sugar =  please give me sugar 
(b) I wan buy fish = I want to buy fish 
(c) Who dey for here? = Who is here? 
(d) Who you be? = Who are you? 
(e) Wetin time dey talk? = What is the time? 
 
(i) Wafe-Rank which is a special variety popular among the Nigerian students. 
Research shows that this category of pidgin evolved at Ajegunle, a suburb of Lagos 
city, mostly inhabited by low-income earners including young musicians who 
perform at clubs where the majority of those in attendance are students and 
socialites of low or average status. Abdullahi-Idiagbon further states that, Wafy as 
being referred to has spread beyond its originators to virtually all nooks and 
crannies of students’ settlement. Musicians like Daddy Showkey, African China, 
Lagbaja and Charlie Boy and many more are examples of the apostles of Wafe 
Ranky. Examples of such pidgin encompass:  
(a)  Unto the next one = Lets move to the next 
(b)  Pass me the rozay = Give me the rozay (alcohol) 
( c)  Yawa don gas = There is trouble 
(d)  Oya scatter the place = cause trouble 
      (e) Ginger your swagger = Display your style 
 
(ii) Hooligan’s version popularly associates with the touts, “area boys” or 
“hoodlums”. It is basically full of street slangs. For example,  

98 
 
(a) I don hear your tape = I have heard about you 
      (b) The babe na milk temple = The lady is big breasted 
(c) You don cast = You are exposed 
(d) If I light your face = If I slap you 
      (e) Give me five vibe = Give me five Indian-helms 
 
Theoretical Framework 
 
Charles Leland’s (1892) theory of baby-talk posits that pidgin is similar to the early 
effort of children language. He noticed that pidgin speakers and children often only 
approximate to the standard pronunciation; they both use a high proportion of content 
words and relatively few function words, that is, in the speech both morphological change 
was rare if not altogether absent; that word classes were much less rigidly established and 
that pronominal contract were frequently reduced. 
 
Bloomfield (1933, p. 472) cited by Todd (1992, p. 27) said “Speakers of a lower 
language may make so little progress in learning the dominant speech that the masters use 
in communicating with them and resort to baby-talk”. To Bloomfield ‘baby-talk’ is the 
master of imitation of the subjects ‘incorrect speech’ 
 
Furthermore, the independent parallel development theory largely propagated by 
Robert A. Hall Jr. (1966) believes that pidgin and creole arose independently and 
developed along parallel line. Robert was among the first scholars to recognize the 
pervading similarities in the world’s pidgin and creole. He and his supporters believe that 
the history of pidgin and creole can be traced back to Indo-European Atlantic and West 
African substratum (Todd 1992). Though the validity of some aspects of this theory cannot 
be underestimated, it has two limitations; firstly, structure and lexis of Atlantic and Pacific 
Pidgin English have common features which do not occur in Standard English and 
secondly, African slaves came from widely separated areas of West Africa and to 
overstress the similarity of their linguistic background is to oversimplify. 
 
As early as 1938,  John Reinecks noted the possible influence of a nautical jargon 
on the development of many pidgins, such a view postulates that the then colonial sailor’s 
lingua franca was passed on to Africans, Asians, Polynesians or whatever people the sailors 
came into contact with. The nautical jargon would thus have provided a nucleus for the 
pidgin, which would then have been expanded according to the model of the learner’s 
mother tongue. Such an explanation helps to account for the similarities and dissimilarities 
that exist in the pidgin Englishes of the world; and this is as a result of the influences 
exerted by different mother tongues. 
 
The nautical jargon theory is an attractive one, but it also fails to explain the many 
structural affinities that exist between Pidgin Englishes and their French, Portuguese, 
Spanish and Dutch counterparts. It is its ability to do that which is the main attraction of 
the monogenetic or reflexification theory. According to this theory, all European-language 
base pidgins are derived from fifteenth century Portuguese Pidgin. 
 
The monogenetic theory formulated by Hugo Schuchardt in the late 19th century 
and popularized in late 1960s by Taylor (1961) and Thompson (1961) envisages a 
Portuguese pidgin deriving ultimately from Sabir.  Portuguese as the originator of both 
Atlantic and Pacific pidgins through a process of reflexification, has many attractions, most 
notably its comprehensiveness. Its comprehensiveness is the chief merit of the 

99 
 
monogenetic theory, even though it may not be regarded as being totally comprehensive, 
since there are other pidgins that exist in the world that are not based on European 
languages and which yet share some of the characteristics of all Portuguese based Pidgin. 
In Africa we have for example Hausa, Zulu, Bemba, and Swahili (Todd 1992, p. 31-36). 
 
The Chosen Framework 
 
The Monogenetic or reflexification theory formulated by Hugo Schuchardt in the 
late 19th century and popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Taylor (1961). 
Thompson (1961) believes that all European language based pidgins and creoles are 
derived from the fifteenth century Portuguese pidgins and that the European languages 
were largely transported through the colonial sailors. The monogenetic or reflexification 
theory is also the base for the Nigeria Pidgin English. The Nigeria Pidgin English has its 
base from the European world English language and colonial slave trade, thereby making 
it a reflection of the Portuguese pidgin. Since all European languages based pidgins are 
derived from the fifteenth century Portuguese pidgins and creoles, monogenetic or 
reflexification theory is the most suitable theory for the Nigeria Pidgin English that is used 
in all aspects of human communication in Nigeria. 
 
The Use of Pidgin in Business 
 
There are several dimensions by which pidgin can be employed in our everyday 
interpersonal interaction. It can be used during conversation between friends, between 
informal social groups. Abdullahi (2010) in his investigation on the uses of pidgin  as one 
of the means of communication submitted four common things the Nigeria Pidgin English 
can be used for by the students on campus. They included: 
(a) To herald musical concert of interest within or outside campus 
(b) To womanize or talk about ladies, or ladies discussing their male friends 
(c) To express basic domestic needs like eating and clothing 
(d) For interpersonal/private discussions 
Similarly, pidgin could be beneficial in business transactions. Business according 
to Hornby (2000, p. 151), “Is the activity of making, buying, selling or supplying for 
money.”  
The use of pidgin in business serves the purpose of 
(i) 
Bridging the gap of communication barrier among partners in business 
(ii) 
Uniting people from diverse  tribe and tongue to achieve a set goal in 
business 
(iii) 
Enhancing business turnover 
(iv) 
Sourcing and spreading useful information on business among the groups 
involved. 
Globalization and quest for survival has caused many people to leave their land of 
birth to another place. Some settle in a new place to educate, to work or to do business. 
Taking Igbo people for example, many of them (male and female) are found in different 
nooks and crannies of the world which Ilorin is not left out, to thrive. Igbo people known 
for their business enterprises are found in great number in such areas like Agaka, Ibrahim 
Taiwo Road,  Tanke, Offa Garage Road, Oja Tuntun, Pata market and basically everywhere 
in Ilorin Metropolis, engaging in one business or the other. Good to know that the brain 

100 
 
behind business is to render services to others and make money out of it. As a result of this, 
many Igbo people have found themselves face to face with people of different languages 
whom they definitely would want to sell their wares to. In order to achieve this, Nigerians 
including Igbo businessmen and women from all walks of life have established great and 
power liking in the use of pidgin to have their desires accomplished. 
 
Data Analysis 
The analysis of data tends to authenticate or undermine the usefulness of pidgin in 
business transaction in Ilorin Metropolis. Total number of (30) questionnaires were 
circulated to the two parties involved in business transaction (sellers and buyers), out of 
which 25 were returned. Nevertheless, (5) copies were void thus (20) copies of returned 
questionnaires were used for this paper. This represents 67% of the total number of 
questionnaires distributed.

Conclusion 
This paper has explored the effectiveness of pidgin in the smooth running of business as it 
pertains to business men and women in Ilorin Metropolis. It has tried to inform that being 
proficient in diverse means of language use and using the appropriate medium of 
expression at the right time, place and context does more good than harm. 
 
Recommendation 
Notwithstanding the appreciative influence of pidgin towards the smooth running of 
business enterprise in Ilorin Metropolis, the paper however recommends that every 
individual needs to make sure that his or her originality is not hampered. This means to say 

107 
 
that no matter how one tries to use every available means to achieve one’s set goals, one’s 
nativity must not be forgotten and one’s mother tongue must not be left to decay.
