The relationship of Nigerian Pidgin English and Standard English in 
Nigeria: Evidence from copula constructions

Abstract 
Deuber (2006) investigated variation in spoken Nigerian Pidgin data by educated 
speakers and found no evidence for a continuum of lects between Nigerian Pidgin and 
Nigerian English. Many speakers, however, speak both varieties, and both varieties 
are in close contact to each other, which keeps the question of the nature of their 
relationship on the agenda. This paper takes a new look at the relationship between 
Nigerian Pidgin and Nigerian English by choosing an approach opposite to Deuber’s. 
We investigate 40 conversations in Standard Nigerian English by educated speakers 
as they occur in the International Corpus of English Nigeria (ICE-Nigeria), using the 
variability in copula usage as a test bed. 
We first provide a variationist analysis in which we list and quantify the 
different copula constructions used by the speakers. We find a range of standard and 
non-standard constructions belonging to either of the two varieties. An implicational 
scaling analysis of the data reveals that there are strong implicational relationships 
between the different variants. Speakers vary, and they do so systematically along a 
cline from more typical to less typical Pidgin structures. 
We argue, however, that the implicational patterning should not be interpreted 
as evidence for the existence of intermediate lects, but as the result of code mixing 
and style shifting. We analyzed our data in terms of Muysken’s Bilingual Speech (2000) 
framework, which posits three kinds of code mixing: insertion, alternation and 
congruent lexicalization, with style shifting being an example of congruent 
lexicalization (p. 123). Based on the code mixing hypothesis, we can make two clear 
predictions. First, the spoken Nigerian English should exhibit the typical constellation 
of properties of congruent lexicalization.  Second, all three types of code-mixing 
should be attested in our data, congruent lexicalization in particular.

Our analysis shows that both predictions are correct. A closer look at the 
individual conversations in our data set (personal relationships of the speakers, topic 
etc.) support the idea that with regard to English and Pidgin in Nigeria, we are dealing 
with language mixing for the purposes of style shifting. The speakers’ competences in 
both languages help them to style-shift along an implicational scale, with topic, 
formality and social relationship as determinants of the code mix.  
 
 
1 Introduction  
 
In Nigeria, English co-exists with an English-based Pidgin, Nigerian Pidgin. Both 
languages serve as lingual Franca amidst over 400 other Nigerian languages spoken 
in Nigeria.  The long existence of these two language varieties in Nigeria draws 
attention to the investigation of their mutual influence. These two languages have 
existed together for a long time in Nigeria and traditionally have been serving 
different purposes. English is the official language and serves prestigious functions as 
the language of the government, education, media etc in Nigeria. Nigerian Pidgin, on 
the other hand, is a contact Language that originated in Nigeria as a result of European 
contact with local languages, mostly through trade transactions. It is accorded a low 
prestige in Nigeria because it is not officially recognized and was mostly used by 
speakers who could not acquire formal education. Over the years, Nigerian Pidgin has 
gradually gained in importance, because the educated Nigerians also use it in 
communication. Research has shown that Nigerian Pidgin is now the language with 
the highest population of users, and also a first language in some minority groups in 
Nigeria (Igboanusi, 2008). The most striking change in status is its prominent use in 
tertiary institutions in Nigeria, which has also resulted in the modification of Nigerian 
Pidgin in different levels of language use (phonology, morphology, syntax etc). Given 
the status, use and long time co-existence of these languages, contact-induced mutual 
influence and change is to be expected (e.g. Thomason 2001, Sankoff 2001). This 
paper investigates the relationship between Nigerian English and Nigerian Pidgin in 
in the speech of educated Nigerians.   

3 
 
A lot of research has been carried out on the co-existence of these two 
languages, focusing on the status of the two languages and speakers’ attitudes towards 
them (e.g., Akande and Salami 2010;  Balogun 2013 ; Osoba 2014; Ama kiri and Igani 
2015; Oreoluwa 2015). Little empirical work has been done, however, on their mutual 
influence. Deuber (2006) approached this issue from the perspective of Nigerian 
Pidgin and found no evidence for the existence of a continuum of lects. The present 
study shifts the perspective and investigates Nigerian English as used by speakers who 
also speak Nigerian Pidgin. We address the following research questions: 
 
1. Is there an influence of Nigerian Pidgin on the Nigerian English used by 
educated speakers? 
2. If there is such an influence, how can this influence be analyzed? Is there a 
continuum? Or are we dealing with code-switching?  
3. What are the possible explanations for the observed patterns of variation? 
 
The data for this study is a set of conversations from International Corpus of English 
(ICE), Nigeria. ICE Nigeria is one of the world-wide varieties of English compiled for 
the analysis of linguistic structures. It represents both written and spoken genre by 
educated speakers, and we used the spoken casual conversations for our study. We 
concentrate on the use of copula constructions, as, across many non-standard varieties 
of English, these constructions have been shown in numerous studies to be highly 
variable (e.g. Ferguson 1971, Holm 1984, Winford 1990, McWhorter 1995, Rickford 
1999, to mention only a few). Deuber (2006) also included the copula in her 
investigation, which will allow us to compare our results directly to hers.  
This paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the reader in 
more detail to the issues tackled in the present article. Section 3 describes the 
methodology and sections 4 and 5 present the empirical results. Section 6 concludes 
the paper.

2  Nigerian Pidgin and Nigerian English 
 
2.1 The starting point: Deuber (2006) 
The present work takes as its starting point the only available variationist study of 
the potential linguistic continuum in Nigeria, Deuber (2006). Two issues prompted 
Deuber’s investigation of a linguistic continuum in Nigeria. The first is what she calls 
a “sweeping generalization” (2006:245) by Todd (1974), that Creole continuum can 
be found in every part of the world where an English based Creole co-exist with 
English. Another issue is Bickerton’s (1975a) assertion that a linguistic continuum has 
emerged in Nigeria as far back as 1960, after Nigerian’s independence. Bickerton 
attributed this to social mobility, which he believes is the vehicle for the development 
of a continuum. According to Bickerton, social mobility favours the development of a 
continuum as people with multilingual backgrounds move from one part of the 
country to another. Furthermore, due to emancipation, there was free movement of 
people across the country and there were opportunities for the uneducated to learn 
English. Because learning did not impart equally on every learner, intermediate 
varieties came into being, and speakers can be located along a continuum from the 
least standard variant (with influence from other local languages) to more standard 
variants.  
 
Deuber (2006) pointed out, however, that there is no detailed empirical 
evidence to support these assumptions. Earlier, Agheyisi (1984) had contradicted 
Bickerton by saying that the relationship that exists between these language varieties 
in Nigeria cannot be described as a continuum in the sense of the Caribbean varieties.  
 
To empirically investigate the possible existence of a continuum in Nigeria, 
Deuber investigated Nigerian Pidgin spoken by educated Nigerian speakers in Lagos, 
the southwestern part of Nigeria. She investigated variation in copula constructions, 
tense-aspect marking and verbal negation. With regard to copula constructions, 
Deuber interprets her data as evidence against the existence of a linguistic continuum. 
As a general result, she finds the two languages as two separate varieties with no 
evidence for intermediate varieties as found in the Anglophone Caribbean. Going back 
to Bickerton’s assertion that social mobility enhances the development of a 

5 
 
continuum, Deuber wonders why after more than 40 years of Nigerian’s 
independence,  no such intermediate varieties have come into existence in Nigeria. 
One of her explanations is that the two situations differed with regard to the 
continuing presence of the substrates. The presence of the substrates in Nigeria may 
have been detrimental to the development of a continuum. 
 
Deuber looked at the Pidgin-to-English continuum, focusing on the changes 
Nigerian Pidgin may have undergone as a result of the influence of English. The 
present work, however, looks at the relationship of Pidgin and English from a different 
angle. It investigates the (potential) English-to-Pidgin continuum, looking at changes 
Nigerian English has undergone as a result of the influence of Nigerian Pidgin. Like 
Deuber, we make use of corpus data for the analysis. In the analysis of the variation 
in the use of copula constructions we employ implicational scaling as a means to 
establish a linguistic continuum. Let us now turn to the linguistic phenomenon that 
we investigate, the copula. 
 
2.2   The copula in English and Nigerian Pidgin 
The English lexical verb BE is known as a linking verb, or ‘copula’. There are other 
verbs in English like seem, appear, look, sound, smell, taste, feel, become etc which, apart 
from their lexical functions, also have linking function. We restricted the scope of this 
work to the English copula BE and its functional equivalents in Pidgin (see Faraclas 
1996: 50 on other linking verbs in Nigerian Pidgin).  
In English, copula constructions are overtly marked by a form of BE and they 
follow the same structural rules of English word order SVO except in cases of inversion 
(e.g. Are you sure?, Here is an example). The complement following the copula may be 
a noun phrase, an adjective phrase, or a prepositional phrase, as shown in (1).1 
 
(1) 
a. 
She is a girl (noun phrase) 
b. 
They are beautiful (adjective phrase) 
c. 
The man is here (prepositional phrase) 
                                                           
1 We follow the assumption that many adverbs are best analyzed a as intransitive prepositions (Emonds 1972, 
Jackendoff 1973, Pullum & Huddleston 2002: 598-603, 612-617).  

6 
 
d. 
The house is on a hill (prepositional phrase)   
 
We also included constructions in which BE functions as an auxiliary (as in He is 
cooking food).  
 
Nigerian Pidgin has a copula system different from that of English. Faraclas 
(1996:46) writes that the “space normally covered by copulas is divided roughly into 
two parts, each of which is coded by one of two basic copula verbs: the copula identity 
verbs bi and the copula locative/ existence verb de”. The third copula verb in Nigeria 
Pidgin is na, which also functions as a focal marker. Just like English, Nigerian Pidgin 
also has some other verbs that may have copulative functions, but we restrict 
ourselves to the three main Nigerian Pidgin copulas discussed in Faraclas’ grammar 
(1996): bi, de, dè (with a low tone marked by the grave accent) and na. The first three 
are also written as be, dey and dèy, respectively. The copula bi and the copula na are 
used as an equative copula as in (2), taken from Faraclas (1996:51). 
 
(2)    a.  
Im bi     man  
 
 
he COP  man 
 
 
‚He is a man‘ 
 
b. 
Di wuman na sista 
                     the  woman  COP  Sister 
                     'The woman is a Sister'. 
 
One important distinction between na and the other copulas in Nigerian Pidgin is that 
na is always followed by a nominal element and can never take auxiliaries, negators 
or non-emphatic pronouns (Faraclas 1996:50). The other two forms can take noun 
phrase and adjective phrases as complements, and can also take auxiliaries and 
negators. 
 
The copula na is also used as an emphatic marker in sentence-initial position, 
as in (3). 
 

7 
 
(3) 
Na  sista we di wuman bi 
           It is sister that the woman COP 
          'The woman is a Sister'. 
 
 
Adjectives do not serve as complements to Pidgin copulas because there are no 
predicative adjectives in Pidgin. What is regarded as predicative adjectives in English 
can be analyzed as stative verbs in Nigerian Pidgin. Consider (4), taken from Faraclas 
(1996:221): 
 
(4)  
Di man fyar  
 
the man fear 
 
‘The man is afraid’   
 
According to Faraclas (p. 45), that there is no zero copula in Nigerian Pidgin. But we 
do find variation in the use of stative verbs, such that stative verbs may also be 
accompanied by the copula de. Observe the contrast between (5a) and (5b). 
 
(5) 
a. 
Ma pikin      de    smol  
 
 
(from Faraclas 1996:48) 
 
 
my children COP small 
 
 
‘My children are small’ 
  
b. 
Di  sup   swit  
 
 
 
(from Faraclas 1996:222) 
 
 
the soup sweet 
 
 
‘The soup is sweet’ 
 
We will remain agnostic as to the kind of syntactic analysis one would want to assign 
to examples such as (4) and (5b), but we will refer descriptively to these constructions 
as ‘zero copula’ or ‘zero’ constructions. 

8 
 
 
The copula dè with a low tone occurs in preverbal position, where it marks 
imperfective aspect.2 Faraclas (p. 186) labels this form as ‘auxiliary. (6) illustrates its 
usage. 
 
(6) 
A de kari nyam 
           I –comp. carry yam 
          'I am carrying yam ' 
 
 
To summarize, there are important differences, but also similarities, in the use 
of the copula between Pidgin and English, which opens up a space for variation across 
varieties. We will see in section 4 that this expectation is borne out by the facts: 
speakers vary between English and Pidgin constructions within the same 
conversation. 
 
3. Methodology  
 
3.1  Data 
The data used for this study come from the International Corpus of English, Nigeria (ICE-
Nigeria, https://sourceforge.net/projects/ice-nigeria/). The International Corpus of 
English is a collection of corpora of world-wide varieties of English that were compiled 
for the analysis of linguistic structures. The ICE varieties represent speech of educated 
speakers (Greenbaum 1996:6) and the corpora have been used in many studies (see, 
e.g., Deuber 2009, 2010; Bolton et al 2002; Oenbring 2010; Gut and Fuch 2013).  
Like the corpora of other varieties, ICE-Nigeria represents both the written text 
category (academic writing, business letters, administrative writings etc) and the 
spoken category (conversations, broadcast news, parliamentary debate etc), with a 
total number of  1,010,382 words. The conversation part of ICE Nigeria represents 
spontaneous speech of speakers from different geopolitical zones in Nigeria. We made 
                                                           
2 Faraclas (1996:202f) uses the terms ‘imperfect‘ and ’incompletive‘ without further 
discussion. Given that the exact aspectual function of dè is not quite clear, we use ‘imperfective’ as 
the established cover term for all non-perfective aspects. 

9 
 
use of 40 conversations by 87 speakers. The nature of the conversations differs, 
depending on the interlocutors. There are group discussions among workers, friends, 
family, and university classmates featuring three to six speakers. Some conversations 
had two speakers, e.g. between husband and wife, or two friends. The topics of 
discussion are familiar ones that have to do with marriage, studies, food, work etc.  
 
3.2   Sampling 
We first extracted utterances with copula constructions or omissions. The extraction 
was done both systematically and manually as to include constructions with copula 
omission. We only sampled declarative sentences to avoid potential complications 
arising from wh-questions and inversions. The sampling of standard inflected forms 
of BE, (is, am, are, was, were, be, being, been) was restricted to 3rd person forms and 
infinitival be. Including other standard forms would only have increased the 
proportion of standard forms in the data set without any further insights into the 
variation between standard and non-standard forms. The resulting data set consisted 
of 1036 tokens of copula constructions with eight variant forms from both languages.  
 
3.3 Coding  
We entered the copula constructions into a spreadsheet according to their form and 
classified them according to the type of construction. We encountered one variant 
that does not seem to belong to either language. This variant involved the use of the 
copula form is without a subject. The values of the two variables FORM and 
CONSTRUCTION are as follows: English main verb is/auxiliary is (‘inflected’), English 
infinitival be (‘inflected’), and Pidgin invariant be (‘invariantBE’), ‘s (‘contracted’), __is 
(‘no subject’), ø (‘zero’), equative na (‘cop na’), focus-marker na (‘foc na’) and de/dè 
(‘dey’). For both English and Pidgin we conflated the auxiliary usage and the 
corresponding main verb into one category. We also coded for other variables: FILE 
(the conversation number), SPEAKER (the identifying number of the speaker as it 
appears in the conversation), GENDER (‘male’ or ‘female’), AGE, and VARIETY (‘standard’ 
or ‘non-standard’). The subjectless form was coded as ‘non-standard’.

4. Results 
 
4.1  Variation 
Let us first look at the distribution of standard and non-standard constructions in our 
data. This is given in figure 1 (the numbers above the bars give the number of 
observations for this category). We can see that about one third of the constructions 
are non-English constructions, which shows that Pidgin is part of the repertoire of the 
speakers in ICE-Nigeria. 
 
Figure 2: Distribution of the standard and non-standard forms 
 
Figure 2 gives the distribution of the different constructions.  

11 
 
Figure 2: Distribution of copula constructions N= 1031 
 
The inflected and contracted BE forms are predominant with 459 and 225 counts, 
respectively. Nigerian Pidgin copula forms are also used in non-negligible 
proportions, with dey and no-subject constructions being most frequent.  
In order to get a better understanding of this variation we implemented an 
implicational scaling analysis. This kind of analysis has been standardly used (at least 
since Decamp (1971)) to test whether linguistic variation is structured in such a way 
that the presence of one feature implies the presence of other features. This model 
can be illustrated as a table where speakers are ranked using plus (+) or (–) sign 
according to the features they use. The “+” sign represents the presence of a standard 
form while the “-” sign represents the absence of a standard form. The features are 
then arranged in such a way that the most acrolectal speaker is placed on top while 
the most basilectal speaker is placed at the bottom. A continuum of lects is formed 
when all the plus (+) signs are in the same direction and all the minus (-) signs are 
in the same direction. This model has been used extensively in the Caribbean (see, 

12 
 
e.g., Bailey 1966; DeCamp 1971; Winford 1988; Patrick 1998a; Deuber 2009). Table 
1 is an example of an ordered implicational scaling based on features from Jamaican 
speakers in Decamp’s work (1971, p355).

Many speakers in our data set provided only a few copula sentences, which is 
detrimental for implicational scaling because it leads to empty cells in the table. We 
therefore decided to select only those speakers for which there are more than 20 
utterances. This gave us eleven speakers for which the distribution of forms is given 
in table 2.

Implicational scaling was possible, with only two of the 88 cells (2.2 percent) going 
against full scalability. The scaled table is given in table 3, in which we abstract away 
from the number of attestations by using a plus sign if a form is attested and a minus 
sign if a form is not attested.

The implicational scale reveals four different patterns of usage, separated by grey 
columns. The further to the right we go in the table, the more non-standard forms are 
being used by the speakers. Note that in the leftmost pattern we could swap the 
columns labelled ‘Contracted’ and ‘No Subject’ since there is no clear evidence for an 
implication. This kind of situation reveals a general disadvantage in using 
implicational scaling. The non-presence of a particular construction in the speech of 
a given speaker could simply be a coincidence, especially if the number of attestations 
is rather low. However, the scalability measure of 97.8 percent shows that the 
variation is quite systematic and predictable. 
 
How can we interpret the patterning of variation in table 3? Much in the spirit 
of analyses of creole continua one could say that the standard forms are on the left, 
and the more we go to the right, the more basilectal the forms become. Inflected forms 
would be the most acrolectal while Pidgin dey and copula na would be the most 
basilectal forms.  We see that almost all the speakers used the English forms, which 
was expected as they represent educated speakers. Other speakers also move across 
the continuum and use English and Pidgin forms. Interestingly, the subjectless 
construction, which is neither a Pidgin construction, nor a standard construction is 
the only non-standard form used by the six speakers that do not use any Pidgin form. 
It seems to have an intermediate status between Pidgin and English. 
 
If we interpret table 3 as a continuum, speaker 04-2 in conversation 04 at the 
top of the scale represents the acrolectal speaker while speaker 15-2 the basilectal 
speaker. Other speakers between them would be considered mesolectal speakers. 
What is also striking is the fact that the two speakers in conversation 04 used almost 
the same features and those in conversation 02 also used the same feature.  
The obvious question now is whether we can interpret the scale shown in table 
3 as a continuum of lects. Such an interpretation is perhaps not warranted since we 
have only one truly intermediate construction and otherwise constructions that are 
either clearly English or clearly Pidgin. This means that we are rather in a diglossic 
situation in which speakers seem to able to mix the two varieties as need be. The next 
section will investigate this possibility in detail.

5.  Structured variation: Code-mixing of English and Pidgin 
 
If we interpret the scale in table 3 in the same way as comparable scales in the 
Caribbean have been interpreted, we should find different speakers identified as 
belonging to a particular lect. These lects will range from the near standard English 
variety at one end to Nigerian Pidgin at the other end. In between the two lects will 
be other intermediate lects. The speakers at the two ends, representing the acrolectal 
and basilectal speakers will not be able to understand each other because their lects 
are wide apart. They will rather understand only those intermediate speakers closer 
to their pole. In that case, no speaker has full command of both languages. Each 
individual has either full command of one language and a little knowledge of the 
other or no command of either language and a little knowledge of both. That is why 
they are placed on a continuum of different lects or codes. 
 
This is not the case with our set of data. What we see in our data is that these 
speakers have full knowledge of the two languages in their repertoire, and are able to 
move from one pole to the other. We claim, however, that this continuum is not a 
continumm of lects, but a continuum of mixtures of two codes. This leads us to 
interpret our data as a case of code-mixing.3 
 
We find different degrees of the mixing at different points of the continuum: 
some speakers with more mixing and some with less mixing. A closer investigation of 
each conversation shows that the code-mixing is as a result of style-shifting. The 
speakers’ competence in both languages help them to style-shift along this continuum, 
with topic, setting, formality and social relationship as determinants of the code-mix. 
We have indirect evidence of this in the implicational scaling table with those 
conversations that have up to two speakers. The two speakers in conversations 04 
used almost the same features and those in conversation 02 also used the same 
features. We interpret this as the speakers’ attempt to style-shift to meet each others’ 
footing depending on the topic, setting and social relationship. We therefore 
                                                           
3 In accordance with the literature (e.g. Bokamba 1988:24, Muysken 2000:1), we use ‘code-
switching’ as the cover-term for the use of two languages in one conversation. ‘Code-mixing’ refers to 
switches between languages that occur intrasententially. 

16 
 
reinterpret our implicational scaling as reflecting a continuum of style, with style as 
a constellation of features that is determined by the extra-linguistic variables 
mentioned above.  
 
Based on these considerations, we set up the hypothesis that we are dealing 
with code-mixing as a style-shifting device. To test this hypothesis empirically, we 
employ Muysken’s bilingual speech framework (2000), which has been used fruitfully 
in many studies of code-mixing (e.g., Deuchar 2005, Deuchar, Muysken & Wang 2008, 
Lipski 2014). Muysken sets up a taxonomy of code-mixing to characterize different 
patterns of code-switching found in bilingual speech communities. In this framework 
style-shifting is considered a subtype of code-mixing called ‘congruent lexicalization’ 
(2000:123, see below). If we are dealing with code-mixing, we can derive two 
predictions from Muysken’s work: 
 
• We should find different patterns of switches that are common in 
uncontroversial cases of code-mixing. 
• More importantly, we should find many switches that are instances of 
congruent lexicalization. 
 
In what follows we will present the results of an analysis that tests these predictions 
 
 5.1 Code-Mixing 
 
Muysken identifies three patterns of mixing that can be found in any bilingual setting: 
Insertion: Material from one language is inserted into the structure of another 
language. This type of pattern follows the Matrix Language Framework theory 
proposed by Myer-Scotton (1993 et seq.) since the notion of ‘insertion’ presupposes a 
matrix language into which lexical material from the embedded language is inserted. 
This pattern has an a-b-a structure, where ‘a’ represents words from the matrix 
language A and ‘b’ represents words from the embedded language B. Example (7), 

17 
 
with Spanish-English code-switching as taken from Muysken (2000:5), illustrates the 
a-b-a structure. The words in italics represent the embedded language.   
 
(7) 
Yo anduve | in a state of shock |  por dos dias 
 
       a                      b                    a 
 
I    walked   in a state of shock  for two days 
 
‘I walked in a state of shock for two days ’ (Spanish/English) 
 
The sentential structure, i.e. the order and categories of the major constituents, is that 
of the matrix language. 
 
Alternation: The structure of a sentence is split between two languages. It has a 
structure that can be schematized as ‘a-b’. This pattern of code-mixing is similar to 
the switching of codes between turns or utterances, in that each segment contains 
complete syntactic contituents, i.e. phrases, that fully reflect the structure of that 
language. See (8), from Muysken (2000:5). 
 
(8) 
Andale pues | and do come again 
 
          a                     b 
 
go-it  well  and do come again 
 
‘That’s alright then, and do come again ’  
 
Congruent lexicalization: Material from two languages is inserted into a shared 
grammatical structure. Hence congruent lexicalization necessitates that the languages 
involved are structurally highly congruent. Similarities in the lexical material between 
the two languages further facilitates congruent lexicalization. The insertion of 
material may occur “more or less randomly” (Muysken 2000:8), as shown in (9), from 
Muysken (2000:5). 

18 
 
(9) 
Bueno, | in other words, | el | flight | que   sale    de      Chicago | around three 
o’clock 
             a               b                 a       b                   a                                       b 
 
Good    in other words    the flight   that   leaves from   Chicago  around three 
o’clock 
 
‘Good, in other words, the flight that leaves from Chicago around three 
o’clock’  
 
To test for the occurrence of the different code-mixing pattern in our data set, we 
coded our data for the three types of code-mixing, using some of the diagnostic 
features proposed by Muysken. As shown in Deuchar, Muysken & Wang (2008), using 
this methodology, it is possible to establish a precise quantitative profile of the 
codeswitching properties in a given corpus. 
 
5.2 Diagnostic Features 
Muysken puts forward some diagnostic features that can be applied to bilingual 
speech data to determine which patterns of code-mixing (insertion, alternation or 
congruent lexicalization) occur, with every conversation involving code-switching 
potentially exhibiting a combination of the different types. We selected those 
diagnostic features that are informative for our task. They can be grouped under the 
headings ‘constituency’, ‘elements switched’ and ‘properties’. 
 
Constituency: Features under this heading code the kinds of constituents that 
participate in intrasentential switches. The following features are grouped under this 
heading: 
• Single constituent: Any syntactic unit, for example a single lexical item, or a 
phrase (NP, VP, PP etc.)  
• Several constituents: More than one phrase 
• Non-constituent: Segments that are not full phrases in either language. This 
occurs when switches are located inside phrases. 

19 
 
• Nested a-b-a: Material from one language that forms one larger constituent 
with the surrounding material from the other language, as in [a b a]XP 
• Non-nested a-b-a: Material from one language (i.e., language b) in which the 
surrounding material from the other language (i.e., from languague a) belongs 
to different constituents, as in, for example [ai]XP b [aj]YP, or [ai b]XP [aj]YP, or 
[ai]XP [b aj]YP. In these configurations, ai and aj belong to different constituents. 
Elements switched: Under this heading we selected two features that are 
pertinent for the kinds of constructions we are investigating. 
• Content word: Verb  
• Function word: Auxiliary 
 
Properties: This category refers to particular characteristics of the switched 
materials. Here we selected only linear equivalence because the other feature (so-
called ‘triggering’) which would have been potentially useful, is rather ill-defined so 
that it cannot be reliably operationalized.4 
• Linear equivalence: The word order in the two languages is the same. 
 
These features are diagnostic of the three different code-mixing patterns in the way 
shown in table 4. A ‘+’ value for a feature indicates that the presence of the feature 
is indicative of a particular pattern. A ‘–‘ value, in contrast, indicates that the presence 
of this feature is a clear indication that the switch is not of this type. A ‘0’ indicates 
that the feature is not diagnostic for the pattern in question, or, in our case, may show 
the absence of the feature from our data set. For illustration consider the feature ‘Non-
constituent’. If it is present this is a clear indication of congruent lexicalization, if it 
is absent this indicates that we are not looking at a case of insertion or alternation. 
The presence of ‘Single constituent’ indicates that we are dealing with insertion, but 
it does not give evidence for or against the other types of mixing. 
                                                           
4 For example, based on Clyne 1967 and Broersma 2009, Lipski (2005:35) defines ‘triggering’ 
as “multi-word switches in which the choice of one of the words in the switch ... may lead to the 
switching of a longer string.” It is unclear how such a vague definition (“may lead to”) can be 
applied consistently.

5.3  Analysis: code mixing 
We first selected all sentences featuring a Pidgin copula and a switch from English to 
Pidgin. Subjectless clauses and clauses with a zero copula were not included because 
covert elements cannot be assigned unambiguously. We then coded each segment 
involving a Pidgin copula according to the categories shown in table 4. Sentences 
such as those in (10) through (12), which are completely in Pidgin, were not 
considered. 
 
(10)  na wa o (con 9) 
(11)  Na wetin me I be dey think o .(con 04) 
(12)  Nebu hole abi wetin them dey call am (con 04) 
 
If a sentence contained more than one Pidgin copula, each switch was analyzed 
separately. An example is given in (13), Pidgin segments are given in italics, the 
copulas are in bold: 
 

21 
 
(13) 
a. 
Na some Africans dey control the place (con 4) 
 
b.  
Na one cave but the thing dey interesting anyway (con 4) 
 
We also have some constructions in our data with two Nigerian Pidgin copulas in a 
single segment. In such cases, we analyse them as one switch. (14) illustrates this case 
(Pidgin segments are given in italics, the copulas are in bold):  
 
(14)  a. 
The funny thing | be say na  | for German so (con 04) 
 
b. 
Maybe | na him be say | I go move (con 04) 
 
Due to the similarities in the lexicon of Nigerian English and Nigerian Pidgin, and the 
similarities in the pronunciation, it is often difficult to decide whether a given string 
is English or Pidgin. In cases of doubt, the word was taken to be English, unless it is 
used in a way that is alien to Nigerian English. Overall, the application of our criteria 
yielded 165 constructions which were subject to further coding. 
 
Recall that under the code-mixing hypothesis we expected to find different 
types of code-mixing patterns (insertion, alternation and congruent lexicalization), 
and many instances of congruent lexicalization in particular. 
 
Based on our coding of the switches, and following the procedure 
implemented, for example, by Deuchar (2005) and Lipski (2014), we assigned the 
value ‘1’, if the switch corresponds to the expected value of the feature and ‘-1’ if the 
switch negates the expected value of the feature. ‘0’ was assigned if the expected value 
of the feature is neutral, or the feature does not occur in the switch. We then sum the 
scores for each pattern. For illustration, Table 5 gives a sample analysis based on the 
first three sentences in our data base. They are given in (15).  
 
(15) 
a.  
Na them dey | drive the biggest car for Nigeria  
 
b. 
them dey | send email  
 
c. 
I'm sure | say na | the guy spoil that room 
 

22 
 
The coding of the features is given in Table 5 in the second column from the left. Each 
‘1’ that is listed in the remaining columns represents positive evidence for a particular 
pattern, each ‘-1’ evidence against a particular pattern. The sums of the scores are 
given in the bottom line of the table. As shown by Deuchar et al. (2008), the scores 
for each type of mixing can be added together in order to achieve an overall score for 
each type of mixing for the whole data set. The scores can be conceptualized as an 
index of the amount of evidence for a particular pattern in a given corpus. 
 
Table 5 illustrates the approach with three sample constructions that were 
coded for the diagnostic features. In all three constructions, congruent lexicalization 
is the dominant pattern, i.e. the pattern for which we have the best evidence as given 
by our diagnostic features.

From the bottom row of Table 6 we can compute the total score that can then be used 
to find the dominant pattern in the data set. This total score is derived by adding the 
figures representing the evidence for and against a particular pattern (‘0’ values are 
ignored, as they do not speak for or against the given type of mixing). For instance,  
adding up the evidence for and against insertion across all codings gives us a total 
score of -144 (i.e. 447-591). If we do the same for the other two categories, as shown 
in table 7, we find that congruent lexicalization is clearly the dominant pattern.

To summarize, the empirical analysis of the sentences with Pidgin copulas has shown 
that all types of switches occur, and that congruent lexicalization is the predominant 
type of mixing in this data set. This result is in line with the predictions that emerge 
from the hypothesis that our data present a case of code-mixing, and not a continuum 

24 
 
of lects. Furthermore, given the predominance of congruent lexicalization we have 
evidence that we are dealing with code-mixing as a style-shifting device. 
 
The style-shifting hypothesis also predicts that social factors should play a role 
in the code mixing found in our data set. Such social factors may be the settings of 
the conversations, the topics discussed, or the relationships of the discussants. Due to 
the lack of pertinent information, the conversations from ICE-Nigeria do not allow for 
a systematic quantitative investigation of the possible influences of social factors, but 
there are some indications to that effect. 
 
In our data, speakers use Pidgin forms mostly when talking to their fellow 
university friends and classmates, and they use them when talking about things that 
happen around them. Consider (17). 
 
(17) 
a. 
This guy him room na self con  (Con 04) 
 
b. 
You know him dey do him PhD. (Con 04) 
 
Interestingly, when the students in ICE-Nigeria conversations talk to their lecturers, 
they consistently use only the standard forms, as illustrated in (18).  
 
(18) 
a. 
That's a professional course (Con 38) 
 
b. 
Very soon I'll be through with my programme (Con 33 ) 
 
c. 
I'd love to be a research fellow (Con 32 ) 
 
d. 
He is the one going to supervise my project (Con  40 ) 
 
We see here that the style-shift is a function of interlocutor, topic and relationship. 
The fact that the use of the non-standard features follows an implicational hierarchy 
does not speak against the idea of style-shifting. Rather, one could hypothesize that 
the use of particular forms is socially constrained, with the forms becoming less and 
less formal from one end of the scale to the other (see again Table 3). 
 

25 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In this paper we investigated the relationship between the standard Nigerian English 
and Nigerian Pidgin English. More specifically we looked at the potential mutual 
influence of the two languages in the speech of educated Nigerians. We used the 
English copula BE and its functional equivalents in Pidgin as our test case, analyzing 
conversations as recorded in ICE-Nigeria.  
 
The data revealed a perhaps unexpected amount of variation among the 
different copula forms. Apart from the use of the standard copula variants, we also 
find different Pidgin copulas in the data and a subjectless construction that is neither 
found in English, nor in Pidgin. The variation lends itself to implicational scaling, 
showing a clear implicational pattern of usage.  
 
We have argued that, unlike in some Caribbean varieties of English, the 
implicational pattern of variation should not be interpreted as a continuum of 
individual lects but as structured shifting. This view is supported by a number of 
considerations and findings: 
 
• The speakers in our sample are fully competent in both Pidgin and English. 
• The language situation in Nigeria is characterized by diglossia, with the two 
languages being traditionally used in different spheres. 
• The predominant pattern of language mixing is congruent lexicalization, which 
in turn indicates style-shifting (Musken 2000) 
• The qualitative evidence from the conversation suggest a strong relationship 
between speech situation (interlocutors, topic, personal relationship) and the 
variation in use of copula variants. 
 
Comparing our results to those of Deuber (2006), we can say that our findings 
corroborate her conclusion that the type of continuum that is typical of the Caribbean 
does not exist in Nigeria. However, in contrast to Deuber, we found a significant 
amount of variation in the use of copula constructions in the speech of educated 
Nigerians, and this variation is structured implicationally. We argued that this 

26 
 
variation is best understood as language-mixing for the purposes of style-shifting. The 
pattern of mixing represents that of competent bilinguals with fluent knowledge of 
the structures of both languages. This helps them to style-shift along a stylistic 
continuum, with topic, settings, formality and social relationship as determinants.
