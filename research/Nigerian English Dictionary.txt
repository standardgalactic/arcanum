Preface 
 
This dictionary of Nigerian English was stimulated by some enquiries from the Oxford English Dictionary 
on words of putative West African origin. The OED faces an increasingly uphill struggle in its attempts to 
capture World English; almost every Anglophone country has now developed a set of distinctive uses, some 
more divergent than others. It is surprising, however, that Nigerian English has never been the subject of a 
published dictionary; rumours abound of mighty manuscripts, but these have yet to see the light of day. A 
recent publication by Igboanusi goes some way towards remedying this deficiency but the inclusion here of 
many words not in his dictionary indicates how much work is still to be done. 
  
The present manuscript is a draft of a document that will eventually, I hope, become a collective product. I 
doubt that one individual could produce anything very comprehensive; Nigeria is too diverse and 
regionalised. But it seems sensible to lay down an initial marker; then additions can be made. I am 
circulating this to individuals I know have an interest; but please send any further information, comments, 
emendations etc. to the email or address given on the title page.

Introduction 
 
These notes are intended to raise some issues on sources, interpretation and the definition of Nigerian 
English. 
 
 
Sources1 
 
One of the most difficult issues in lexicography is documenting usages in a semi-written language. If 
dictionaries of indigenous African languages are prepared they usually depend entirely on oral sources and 
thus no specific justification is given for entries. However, Nigerian English is sometimes written, especially 
in newspapers and magazines, and thus has some sort of orthographic tradition. Nonetheless, many of the 
most picturesque expressions are strictly oral and must still be captured in the present document. Although 
previous studies in this direction have tended to cite novels or literary works (notably Jowitt 1991) these are 
sometimes unrepresentative of the spoken language. I have therefore used newspaper, notices and overheard 
speech as sources. Example sentences not specifically sourced should be treated as based on the author’s or 
his correspondents’ experiences. 
 
 
Spelling 
 
Nigerian English is printed regularly in the newspapers and since much of it consists of using SE in 
extended senses spelling is generally not a problem. Some forms of pidgin origin such as ‘done’ have 
conventional representations, e.g. ‘don’. However, others, such as ‘rubber’ are pronounced in a variety of 
forms, such as rçba, rUba etc. depending on sociolinguistic considerations. To capture this, I have written 
phonologised pronunciations in square brackets after head entry. Thus; 
 
leather [lεda] 
 
 
Nigerian /Ghanaian/ West African English 
 
One of the more surprising things about Nigerian English is the extent to which it has a common lexicon and 
grammar with other West African Englishes, notably Ghanaian. A guide to Ghanaian English (Kirby 1998) 
provides an interesting comparison with the present document and parallel forms are noted2. I have less 
information about Cameroun, Sierra Leone and Gambia and would welcome further insights. However, the 
puzzle is the history of some of these forms. Do they go back to the early days of colonial presence on the 
coast or are they more recent products of the massive migration of Ghanaians to Nigeria during the oil-boom 
era of the 1970s and 1980s? Probably both, but only a detailed scanning of earlier sources will provide 
answers. 
 
 
Pidgin versus Nigerian English  
 
Nigerian English is regarded as distinct from Pidgin English, although the exact location of the boundary 
between them differs from speaker to speaker. Some expressions are regarded as strictly Pidgin, for example 
pickin for 'child' and sabi for 'to know'. I have thought it best to be quite inclusive, but no doubt some of the 
entries will be questioned. 
 
 
                                                      
1 Thanks to Philip and Vicky Ostien and especially to Kay Williamson for many useful suggestions. 
2 Prof. Mary Esther Kropp-Dakubu of Legon University has kindly gone through the draft text and marked all those 
entries which also have parallels in Ghanaian English.

Auxiliaries 
 
Often the distinctiveness of Nigerian verbs in use consists of unusual auxiliaries applied to conventional 
verbs. Some of these are as follows; 
 
done 
 
he done go 
he went [Pidgin!] 
 
got 
 
the thing got spoiled 
 
the water got finished 
 
has 
 
he has go 
he went [just imperfect learning, not standard] 
 
use to 
 
he use to come here 
he comes here regularly [back formation from used to] 
 
 
Student slang 
 
Schools and universities are good but extremely localised sources of slang; Ibadan University in particular 
seems to have been an important source of unusual expressions. Indeed a small book was published of these 
expressions when Ibadan was the only university (Opara & Oleghe 1956). Asomugha (1981) began life as a 
compendium of student slang but was enlarged to take in some more mainstream Nigerian English 
expressions. Such expressions are often highly localised in time and place; few expressions mentioned in 
this book appear to be still in use. Where a term seems to be student slang I have noted it; this is a rich and 
distinct field. Kay Williamson (p.c.) has supplied a number of expressions currently (2002) in use in the 
University of Port Harcourt, but it is difficult to know how widespread these are. 
 
 
Tropical English 
 
There are numerous terms which may be termed ‘Tropical English’; unknown to most speakers of SE, they 
are nonetheless not specific to Nigeria, but are nonetheless widely used across the Anglophone tropics.  This 
is very common in pan-tropical plants, for example ‘oil-palm’ or ‘yam-mound’. I have marked these in the 
text as TE. 
 
 
Pronunciation spellings 
 
These are spellings which arise because two English words are pronounced alike by Nigerians and the two 
spellings, which reflect different pronunciations for SE speakers, get confused or treated as equivalent.  Most 
are nonce-forms, but the following examples are typical.

Portmanteau words 
 
The portmanteau word, first introduced by Lewis Carroll as a humorous excursus of Humpty-Dumpty, is a 
lexical reality in Nigeria. Two sound-alikes are combined into a single form as the following examples 
show; 
 
impressionario is a common written form of impressario, presumably a portmanteau form ‘impressario’ + 
‘impression’ 
virgina common spelling of vagina presumably by re-interpretation from virgin 
 
 
Re-interpretation of Pidgin 
 
An interesting process is the movement from Pidgin back into Nigerian English through relexicalisation. For 
example; 
 
Pidgin 
de ting no gree boil 
the liquid will not boil 
NE 
the kettle did not agree to boil 
the kettle won’t boil 
 
The pidgin expression is primary and it has been re-expressed by a speaker who sees the second formulation 
as more prestigious. 
 
 
Style versus substance 
 
The most comprehensive sources for Nigerian English prior to this are Jowitt (1991) and Igboanusi (2002). 
When native English speakers try to characterise Nigerian English it is clear that their personal perceptions 
play an important role in determining which lexical items or usages are distinctive. For example, Nigerian 
newspapers often use the stereotyped expression ‘men of the underworld’ to refer to criminals. This would 
be unlikely to occur in a current British newspaper, and has an archaic or jocular feel to it. Still, it is 
perfectly comprehensible to a speaker of standard English and the component words show no significant 
lexical deviation from their normal meanings. Contrast this with ‘area-boys’, also referring to criminals, 
which would have no meaning to a speaker of Standard English. Thus, although I have carefully been 
through the previous sources, I have excluded many entries that seem to be matters of style rather than true 
lexical difference.

From NE to SE 
 
A similar process occurs where NE is being relexicalised to SE by certain speakers. Generally speaking, the 
newspapers, formerly a great source of NE expressions, have become closer to SE since the 1980s, almost 
certainly due to greater exposure to SE forms through the dissemination of news magazines such as Time 
and Newsweek. For example; ‘hotel’ is commonly applied to bars and drinking places that serve food but 
may have no lodging and ‘hotel’ in the SE sense is ‘guest hotel’. But modern usage is gradually replacing 
this so that NE is coming to conform to SE. 
 
 
Spelling pronunciation 
 
Nigerian English has one or two distinctive spelling-pronunciations, the most characteristic of which is to 
always pronounce written ‘ch’ as /tS/ even when Standard English has /S/. Two common examples are the 
personal name Charlotte, where /tSarlçt/ is heard in place of /Sarlçt/ and ‘chalet’, pronounced /tSalEt/ rather 
than /Sale/. The second syllable of ‘chalet’ case illustrates another example of spelling pronunciation, but this 
is in turn a loanword into English. 
 
 
Missionary English 
 
I have marked some entries ME, ‘Missionary English’. Missionaries seem to have been responsible for some 
particular usages that were propagated via church materials. These include pejorative terms for traditional 
religion such as ‘idol’, ‘fetish’ and ‘juju’, but also a series of terms for animals, assimilating indigenous 
West African animals to those found in Europe and north America. These include ‘fox’ for genet and 
‘rabbit’ for giant rat.  [Many of the early missionaries were of Sierra Leonean rather than European origin; 
possibly some of these are due to their interpretations of English words.] 
 
 
Scientific names, and trade names 
 
In the early colonial era, when many new species were coming to scientific attention and the uses of those 
known botanically were also being explored, many West African vernacular names were developed, notably 
for timbers and for economic grasses. These were used in colonial literature but with a few exceptions never 
really entered West African speech and are rarely heard today. For example, the African olive, Canarium 
schweinfurthii, is called the ‘bush-candle’ in older literature. Charming and evocative as this name is, I have 
never heard it in current speech and perhaps it was only ever used by forestry officers in the colonial era.  I 
have entered such forms sparingly, pending further evidence of their context of use. Nonetheless, there are a 
great many names for the timbers of Nigerian trees that are used, although in the specialised context of the 
timber trade. Some of these are Nigerian, used in the West African region and some have become 
international trade names. I have adopted the entries from FMI (1964) sometimes updated with reference to 
Burkill (1985 ff.). 
 
 
Regional variation 
 
There is considerable regional variation in NE, most notably between north and south, but also east and 
west. The lexicon presented in Igboanusi (2002) for example, is rich in Yoruba and Igbo terms, but omits 
many terms from the North, the Delta and Calabar. The presence of large communities of migrants, 
especially in urban areas somewhat blurs these distinctions but nonetheless it is possible to assign some 
terms to specific areas of the country. I have marked these where known, but considerable further work is 
required. There also seem to be quite a large number of terms local to the Niger Delta, often reflecting its 
specialised environment and history.

Phonology 
 
It is not yet clear whether it would be reasonable to say NE has a phonology. Borrowings from indigenous 
languages in different regions import phonemes that are alien to English. For example, the labial-velars, /kp/ 
and /gb/ are found in SNE in loans but are generally absent from NNE, as are the items they denote. An 
interesting further issue is the presence of tone. Some exclamations clearly have contrastive tone, typically 
High-Low; 
 
òóò tag placed at the beginning of sentences, following the assertion of a previous speaker indicating 
negative consequences 
 
but lexical tone appears to have little functional role in other parts of the vocabulary.

damask 
n.   
damask For those who do 
not know what damask looks like, it is an 
ornamented fabric with special pattern.  It has a 
hard, paper-like texture, which softens after 
series of washings. …Back in the 60s, damask 
was used to sew iro and buba as well as 
danshiki.  Today, it is being limited to ipele, gele 
and fila, probably because it is expensive.
