Abstract 
Nigeria’s linguistic landscape is shaped with over 
500 languages with English as the official language 
and none of these indigenous languages has been 
designated as such. In the face of these linguistic 
challenges, 
Nigerian 
Pidgin 
English 
(NPE) 
emerges as a potential unifying force, promising 
national 
unity, 
socio-cultural 
identity, 
and 
economic progress. This study delved deeply into 
the discourse surrounding the proposed adoption of 
the NPE as Nigeria’s official languagealongside 
English, highlighting both the opportunities and 
challenges inherent in this paradigm shift. Utilising 
a comprehensive analysis of 510 survey responses 
gathered from across Nigeria’s six geopolitical 
zones, this research investigated the diverse array 
of opinions, perceptions, and concerns expressed 
by various stakeholders. Through in-depthdata 
analysis and detailed discussions, the paper found 
that the majority of the respondents supported the 
adoption of theNPE as the official national 
language in Nigeria, citing its propensity to foster 
national unity, preserve cultural identity, carry all 
communitiesalong, enhance communication and 
educational 
access, 
and 
create 
economic 
opportunities. 
However, 
a 
few 
respondents 
apprehended its adoption based on such challenges 
as standardisation, stigmatisation, displacement of 
indigenous languages, negative impact on English 
proficiency,and 
others. 
Their 
apprehension 
notwithstanding, the advantages outweigh the 
challenges of adopting NPE as Nigeria’s official 
language. The study recommended advocacy for 
the promotion of theNPE and theconcurrent 
safeguarding 
of 
the 
indigenous 
languages.Emphasis was placed on stakeholders’ 
engagement, stressing the need for inclusive 
dialogues 
involving 
linguists, 
policymakers, 
educators, and the broader populace to navigate 
this complex linguistic landscape successively.

Introduction 
A country’s official language, which is 
also its internationally recognised language, is that 
particular language given some specific formal 
functions. It is used for correspondence between 
government offices and the general public, as well 
as between officials. Within a nation, more than 
one official language may coexist simultaneously. 
Nigeria is a multilingual country in which more 
than five hundred (500) languages are spoken. 
However, due to the status of the English language 
as a second language without any relatedness to 
any of the indigenous languages, it is made the sole 
official language in the country, a situation that has 
led to the relegation of most of those indigenous 
languages to the background in the country.Three 
of the indigenous languages (Hausa, Igbo, and 
Yoruba) are chosen as the national languages of 
the country. However, the three languages are 
treated with controversy and suspicion among both 
the majority and minority ethnic groups. The 
phenomenon of making a foreign language the 
Nigeria’s official language has been a serious 
concern to linguists and administrators alike. This

situation has continued unabated despite efforts by 
successive governments in the country. 
The recognition of theNPE as official 
language holds promise of inclusivity, improved 
communication, 
and 
potential 
socioeconomic 
benefits, given its capacity to serve as a unifying 
medium of expression (Giles & Ogay, 2007). 
Additionally, the potential adoption of theNPE as 
an official language may address linguistic 
inequality, providing avenues for greater cultural 
representation and linguistic empowerment (Owu-
Ewie, 2019). The language has established itself as 
a language of everyday interaction across various 
regions of the country (Bello, 2018). Elevated 
national unity and inclusion are promised by its 
accessibility, which boasts broad intelligibility 
across varied groups and a simplified grammar 
(Elugbe&Omamor, 1991). It is a dynamic cultural 
marker that may convey Nigeria’s distinct voice on 
the international scene because of its flexibility and 
dynamism, which capture the country’s growing 
spirit (Okunna&Gausam, 2018). 
Officialising 
NPE 
is 
not 
without 
obstacles, though. Some who are sceptical about 
NPE express apprehensions over its alleged 
inadequacy and uniform structure, casting doubt on 
its appropriateness for official fields such as 
education and management (Ukaonu, 2019). Some 
worry that other indigenous languages may be 
marginalised as a result of the officialisation, 
worsening already-existing linguistic disparities 
(Ajayi, 2011). There are also several regulatory 
and logistical obstacles, necessitating careful 
planning for budget distribution, implementation, 
and future social changes. 
There are numerous research works on the 
NPE. Of all those scholars who have made the 
NPE their focus, few have made calls for its 
adoption as an official language of Nigeria through 
the lenses of educated Nigerians in Nigerian 
universities. It is through the above fact that we 
can see the necessity of the present research.This 
study investigates the phenomena surrounding the 
complexities of the NPE. Through an examination 
of the linguistic, social, and political ramifications 
of the possible officialisation of NPE, the goal is to 
examine the positive and negative impacts of the 
NPE. This study offers important insights into the 
future of NPE and its role in forming the linguistic 
landscape of Nigeria, which adds to the continuing 
discussions on language policy and national unity. 
 
 
 
 
II. 
Literature Review 
The Nigerian Sociolinguistic Landscape  
The exceptional multilingualism of the 
Nigerian linguistic landscape is one of its most 
noticeable uniqueness. Most Nigerians speak more 
than one language; they typically acquire their 
mother tongues at home and pick up additional 
languages in the workplace, in school, and in 
commerce (Elugbe&Omamor, 1991). Due to 
widespread multilingualism, societal boundaries 
are bridged and a distinct sense of shared language 
identity 
is 
created, 
fostering 
intercultural 
conversation and understanding. 
The three main languages that make up 
the body of the national languages include Hausa, 
which is mostly spoken in the north; Yoruba and 
Igbo, which are predominant in the southwest and 
southeast, 
respectively 
(Crystal, 
2003); 
and 
standing above them is English, which was 
adopted as the official language during British 
colonisation. These languages are deeply ingrained 
in culture and politics, frequently being linked to 
particular areas and ethnic groups. Although 
regional languages are important for cultural 
expression, identity creation, and community 
cohesiveness, English is still the language of 
administration and education. 
However, the sociolinguistic terrain is 
embodied in complexities. The long-lasting effects 
of colonialism are seen in the marginalisation of 
indigenous languages due to English’s preference. 
According to Ozo-Udo and Adedimeji (2019), this 
may result in language disparities, impede 
educational possibilities, and maintain social 
hierarchies. Furthermore, linguistic variety itself 
might provide difficulties, possibly escalating 
tensions between ethnic groups and posing queries 
regarding the unity and identity of the country. 
These intricacies conceal strong linguistic 
dynamics and adaptability factors. A powerful 
representation of this dynamic is Nigerian Pidgin 
English (NPE), a lingua franca resulting from the 
contacts of many cultural groups (Faraclas, 2004). 
NPE gives Nigerians from all walks of life a 
common linguistic space and transcends regional 
boundaries with its blend of indigenous languages, 
English, and Creole features. It exemplifies the 
inventiveness and adaptability of the country and 
provides a window into the capacity of language to 
heal divisions and promote peace and unity. 
In summary, Nigeria’s sociolinguistic 
environment 
is 
a 
dynamic 
and 
complex 
phenomenon made of historical forces, languages, 
and identities. Navigating this terrain of power 
relations and inequality and continuing discussions

about language, culture, and nationhood is 
necessary to comprehend it. In order to shape a 
future where all voices are heard and all languages 
are cherished, reflecting the actual diversity and 
resilience of the Nigerian spirit, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the problems and celebrate 
the strengths of this multilingualism. 
 
Nigeria Pidgin English and its Features 
Nigerian 
Pidgin 
English 
(NPE) 
is 
particularly influenced not just by the English 
language but by indigenous languages too. 
According to Egbokhare (2003), Nigeria, which 
has 436 indigenous languages in total, is a 
linguistically diverse country where Nigerian 
Pidgin flourishes. Similarly, Bamgbose (1991) 
acknowledges that NPE is widely used as a 
communication tool in Nigeria. Given the variety 
of languages spoken in the nation, the Nigerian 
Pidgin English (NPE) is a language that facilitates 
larger communication. Pidgin lacks noun-verb 
agreement ends and regular grammar. Because NP 
differs in depth and usage among regions, it cannot 
be considered standard. Nigeria’s multilingual 
society is inherently prone to code-switching and 
code-mixing. Because it is frequently employed in 
situational code-switching – where the context 
necessitates a shift in language to suit a third party 
who may not be proficient in the original speaker’s 
language – the NPE is one of the languages that is 
frequently used in code-mixing and code-switching 
in particular. 
In addition, the NPE is easier to acquire 
and more systematic than Standard English (SE). 
They have abandoned morphological and syntactic 
anomalies, but they haven’t given up on being able 
to clearly and concisely convey the language 
requirements of their speakers. It should be 
mentioned that pidgin does not have to play as 
many functions as a distinct mother tongue because 
it is learned as an auxiliary language. Furthermore, 
it may be developed to meet the growing 
communication demands of its users and is entirely 
appropriate for the linguistic functions in which it 
is employed. Thirdly, although pidgin vocabulary 
is less than that of SE, it may express identical 
ideas with fewer words, frequently by extending 
fundamental vocabulary items like belly, eye, and 
hand metaphorically to represent abstractions. 
Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) is a 
powerful representation of the difficulties and 
nuances that Nigerian language policy faces. NPE, 
which originated from the blending of English, 
Creole characteristics, and indigenous languages, 
has become a lively national language (Faraclas, 
2004). NPE is marginalised in official areas but 
flourishes in informal spheres where it is essential 
to popular culture, music, and business. The 
controversy around the possible officialisation of 
NPE brings to light the conflict between the 
acceptance of dynamic, ever-evolving forms of 
communication and language standardisation. 
According to Ethnologue Languages of the World, 
NPE has about 4.7 million native speakers and 116 
million estimated speakers. About 50.43% of 
Nigerians use NPE, based on the United Nations 
estimate of Nigeria’s 230 million population as of 
June 2023. This makes NPE the most widely 
spoken language in Nigeria after English. 
 
Features/components of the Nigerian Pidgin 
English 
Nigerian Pidgin English, born from the historical 
interactions of diverse groups, boasts unique 
features that set it apart from both its English and 
indigenous language influences. Below are some of 
the distinct features of the NPE: 
Simplified Grammar: NPE does away with the 
intricacies of verb conjugations and noun plurals, 
in contrast to its English relative. Only in the 
present tense does the verb “to be” exist, as in “I 
dey chop” (I am eating). The term “dem” is 
commonly used to indicate plurals, as in “Dem 
boys deyplay” (Those boys are playing). Due to its 
simplified syntax, NPE is easily understood by 
speakers of other languages, which has led to its 
widespread use as a lingua franca. 
Creative Borrowing: NPE adds a distinct flavour 
to vocabulary by freely incorporating words from 
English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and 
other languages. While words like "agabda" (a big 
male cloth), “wahala” (problem),  and “okada” 
(motocycle) have Yoruba roots, English is the 
language used to create words like “chop” (eat), 
“sabi” (know), (trouble), “sharp sharp” (quickly), 
“yab”, and (to insult). The historical interactions 
and cross-cultural exchanges that shaped NPE are 
reflected in this light-hearted borrowing. 
Tone and rhythm: Like many other native 
Nigerian languages, NPE is a tonal language. 
Words can have different meanings depending on 
how you pronounce them, such as “mama” 
(mother) vs. “mámà” (large mother). This makes 
NPE a language that is as much heard as it is 
spoken, 
enhancing 
communication’s 
melodic 
richness and expressiveness. 
Sentence structure: NPE has adaptable sentence 
patterns that frequently stray from the word order 
seen in English. It is possible to formulate 
questions without inversion, like “You don chop?”

(Have you eaten yet?). The sentence structure is 
further simplified by the frequent omission of the 
word “to be”. 
Informal Register: NPE is best used in casual 
contexts where it may be used as a language for 
humour, ordinary communication, and artistic 
expression. 
Its 
informal 
tone 
and 
loose 
grammatical constraints render it inappropriate for 
serious contexts such as academic discourse or 
judicial processes. 
In conclusion, NPE is a distinctive linguistic 
construct that reflects Nigeria’s rich cultural fabric 
thanks to its simple syntax, inventive borrowing, 
tonal subtleties, and casual register. It serves as a 
reminder that languages are living, breathing 
organisms that change and adapt to the ever-
changing sociolinguistic environments in which 
they 
find 
themselves. 
Comprehending 
the 
characteristics of NPE provides important insights 
into the cultural identity and social interactions that 
create the Nigerian experience, in addition to 
illuminating the intriguing nuances of language 
contact and growth. 
 
Nigerian language policy and planning 
The language policy of Nigeria is heavily 
influenced by the legacies of British colonisation. 
English is given preference as the official language 
in the fields of government, education, and 
administrative 
business. 
Although 
English 
promotes national unity and facilitates international 
communication, 
concerns 
about 
the 
marginalisation of indigenous languages and the 
deterioration of culture are raised by this 
favouritism 
(Ozo-Udo 
&Adedimeji, 
2009). 
English’s dominating position is further cemented 
by the National Policy on Education, which was 
created in 1978 and demands that it be used as the 
medium of instruction starting in elementary 
school. 
This focus on English has not, however, 
been without criticism. There have been concerns 
expressed about the discrepancy between students’ 
real experiences and the language used in the 
classroom, 
especially 
in 
rural 
regions 
(Elugbe&Omamor, 
1991). 
Research 
has 
demonstrated the detrimental effects of mother 
tongue neglect on early literacy development and 
cognitive 
maturation 
(Anyaoku, 
2010). 
Furthermore, giving English preference might 
worsen social injustices by disadvantageously 
affecting pupils from areas where native tongues 
are more common. 
There have been some policy modifications 
made in recognition of these inadequacies. In 2004, 
the National Policy on Education was updated to 
highlight the value of mother-language instruction 
throughout the early elementary school years. This 
action is a step in the right direction towards 
realising how important indigenous languages are 
to cultural identity and cognitive development. The 
success of mother tongue education programmes is 
sometimes hampered by poor teacher preparation 
and few resources, leading to inconsistent 
implementation on the ground. 
 
III. 
Methodology 
This research adopts a series of mixed 
methods of data collection and analysis. Since the 
research is a survey of ideas from the educated 
users of NPE (especially university communities, 
which contain people of diverse linguistic 
backgrounds), it targets the research population of 
the six (6) geopolitical zones in the country, 
namely: 
South-west, South-south, South-east, 
North-central, North-east, and North-west zones. 
Then, two (2) universities are randomly sampled in 
each of these geopolitical zones with the aim of 
fair representation. Long-term proximity is also 
considered when selecting these universities. The 
rationale behind the selection is that since NPE has 
always faced backlash from the educated and elites 
in the country, the research is, therefore, focused 
on them. Then, two (2) universities are randomly 
sampled in each of these geopolitical zones with 
the aim of fair representation. 
Through a survey or questionnaire, the 
researcher elicits the attitudes and perceptions of 
the respondents. The Google-form structured 
questionnaire, which contains thirty-two questions 
and is partitioned into five (5) sections, including 
demographic information, awareness of the usage 
of NPE, prospects of making NPE an official 
language, challenges of making NPE an official 
language, language policy and planning in Nigeria, 
and recommendations, is sent to each university. 
In analysing the data for this study, the 
researcher uses a simple percentage score (%) and 
frequency table. Both quantitative and qualitative 
analyses are adopted in analysing the data in order 
to achieve the objectives of the research.

The awareness and usage of the NPE by 
the respondents take different shapes. Out of our 
510 respondents, 483 are familiar with it, while 
only 27 mention that they do not use it. This 
represents 94.7% and 5.30%, respectively. On the 
frequency of their usage, 18 (3.53%) respondents 
have never used it (the lowest category of users), 
while 92 (18.04%) rarely use it. In addition, 151 
(29.61%) respondents sometimes use it, and 211 
respondents frequently use it, the largest users. 
Only 38 respondents respond that they always use 
NPE in all of their activities. 
In terms of proficiency, 35 (6.86%) 
respondents lack proficiency in the language, a 
great number of 287 (56.27%) have moderate 
proficiency in the language, and only 13 (2.55%) 
have native-like proficiency in the language. These 
are likely people who are born and brought up in 
places like Warri in Benin where NPE the usage of 
NPE 
supersedes 
that 
of 
other 
indigenous 
languages. Of course, 405 (79.41%) respondents 
have good attitudes towards NPE, while 33 do not 
relate well to it. Then, 77% of the respondents 
believe NPE is a language of all and not of elites or 
commoners, and this shows the good attitude 
people have towards it. While 370 and 270 (35.05 
and 27.75%) use NPE in informal conversation and 
social gatherings, respectively, this shows the 
language is not welcomed in official settings, even 
though 390 (76.47%) feel comfortable using it.

Table 4 
 
Looking at the prospects of making NPE 
an official language, 285 (55.88%) respondents 
opine that the official status of NPE can positively 
impact national unity and identity, even though 
120 (23.53%) are indifferent about this prospect. 
This justifies how Nigeria is polarised along ethnic 
lines. Because it has features of indigenous 
language and culture, a number of 301 (58.82%) 
posit that the language can contribute to cultural 
preservation. NPE enhances communication in the 
country, and this is justified by 390 (76.47%) who 
accept this claim. 277 and 385, representing 
54.32% and 75.49%, respectively, opine that NPE 
will positively impact education and language 
policy and boost the economy of the country 
through trade and commerce. These people believe 
that it is important to adopt NPE as an official 
language because some teachers of some school 
subjects, especially science-based subjects, face 
numerous challenges in teaching those subjects 
because most scientific terms cannot be explained 
in indigenous languages to the students. The 
teachers can adopt NPE to explain them or coin 
equivalents for them. 
In addition, 304 (59.61%) opine that NPE 
can relate to ease of administration, and 279 
(54.71%) believe that it can positively impact 
literature, arts, and media in Nigeria. Lastly, the 
respondents who reject the questions or hypotheses 
above and those who are indifferent about them, 
when combined, do not equal the number of those 
who show positivity about them.

will not affect her international image, 163 
(31.96%) believe it will affect it, and 102 (20%) 
are indifferent about the situation. If NPE will 
affect or displace other languages, the majority 
opine to this notion with 244 (47.84%) votes, while 
212 do not believe in it. NPE cannot displace or 
affect indigenous languages if made an official 
language, just as English language has not 
displaced other indigenous languages. In some 
countries, like Papua New Guinea, Tok Pisin, as a 
Pidgin, has not displaced English or Hiri Motu. 
The same thing happens in Haiti. 
In the question of whether officialising 
NPE has economic implications, 254 (49.8) opine 
to this circumstance, while 215 (42.2%) reject it. 
The economic challenges are foreign economic 
engagements, and in this situation, the English 
language can come to the aid of communication. 
While a whopping number of 303 (59.41%) 
respondents believe that NPE will affect the 
acquisition and learning of Standard English, 165 
(32.35%) and 41 (8%) are of counter opinion and 
indifferent, respectively. This situation is bound to 
happen as learners tend to merge features of NPE 
with those of Standard English. Lastly, 290 
(56.86%) opine that officialising NPE will not 
create any division in the already divided Nigeria, 
and no ethnic group will claim ownership of the 
language because almost all the major languages in 
the country have features in the NPE. Only 171 
(33.53%) believe that such officialising will create 
more division. The latter people show fears that 
NPE is more dominant in some regions than others, 
especially in the southern part of the country.

Table 6 
 
In the question of the difficulty of making 
NPE an official language due to standardisation of 
the NPE, 273 (53.53%) opine that it will not be 
difficult to standardise. The language can be 
codified with the aid of grammarians, linguists, 
phonologists, and lexicographers in the county. 
Even the combination of those who believe it will 
create difficulty and those who are indifferent do 
not match the former. Although 308 (60.39%) 
respondents believe that making NPE an official 
language has a tendency to negatively impact 
government communication, it is because the 
elites, especially those political officer holders, do 
not have a good attitude towards the language. 245 
(48.04) respondents opine that making NPE an 
official language will negatively impact education 
and literacy. It will only affect the acquisition and 
learning of Standard English; however, it will aid 
general education.

language in Nigeria? 
Table 7 
 
In the tabular computation above, 305 
(59.80%) respondents recommend that NPE be 
made an official language alongside English. This 
is born out of consideration of the large number of 
users of the language, which is the second most 
spoken language in the country after English. 
Then, 338 (66.27%) respondents also recommend 
that special policies, educational initiatives, or 
linguistic programmes are necessary to aid the 
standardisation of the language, and 292 (57.25%) 
recommend supporting the officialisation of NPE 
alongside English in Nigeria. 
 
IV. 
Recommendations 
From the analysis, it is obvious that a good number 
of the respondents have good attitudes towards 
NPE and want it officialised while others reject the 
idea due to the reasons mentioned above. To give 
NPE official status alongside English, the research 
makes the following recommendations: 
1. 
Nigerians should have more positive 
attitudes towards NPE; these include the elite 
groups who feel NPE is a language of the 
commoners. 
Citizens 
should 
embrace 
multilingualism 
and 
consider 
the 
potential 
prospects of the NPE. 
2. 
In a bid to officialise the NPE, linguists, 
lexigographers, grammarians, phonologists, and 
other language specialists should be empowered so 
as to work in unity to devise ways by which the 
NPE will be standardised. This will pave the way 
for its official status. 
3. 
The government should be open to 
discussions on officialising the language. The 
National Assembly should call for proposals and 
bills to hear people on the implementation of the 
language. 
4. 
Media houses, art practitioners, and 
writers should inculcate NPE in their works. This 
will increase the usage of the language. 
5. 
Students, irrespective of their linguistic 
backgrounds, should consider using NPE in their 
social lives and seek the implementation of its 
official status. 
6. 
Further research should focus on a larger 
audience 
with 
the 
inclusion 
of 
political 
stakeholders and state actors while focusing on the 
practical usage of the language. 
 
 
 
 
V. 
Conclusion 
Nigeria is a multilingual nation with over 
500 languages. In fact, every educated Nigerian is 
bilingual. English is the country’s official language 
alongside three national languages (Hausa, Igbo, 
and Yoruba languages).There have been various 
calls for officialising or raising the status of the 
NPE to an official language due to its vast 
prospects. Using 510 responses from 600 sampled 
participants, the study delved into the analysis of 
the prospects and challenges of the NPE as a 
project by the respondents. The research found that 
a quite large number of the participants support the 
implementation of the NPE as an official language 
alongside English, without forgetting the numerous 
challenges attached to the usage of the language. In 
order to solve Nigerian linguistic problems, which 
include the fear of linguistic dominance of the 
major languages over the other indigenous 
languages, NPE is the answer to the question of the 
official 
language. 
This 
research, 
therefore, 
contributed to the body of existing national calls 
for the adoption of NPE as an official language 
alongside English in Nigeria.
