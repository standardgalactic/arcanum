Abstract 
Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) is a widely spoken language in Nigeria and is used by 
many Nigerian students in educational institutions. It evolved into a predominant means 
of communication among Nigerians, serving as the most extensively used language of 
interaction across diverse ethnic groups that lack a shared linguistic background. This 
study examines the use, perception, and recognition of NPE by Nigerian students at 
Coventry University (CU) in the UK. To determine the perspectives and attitudes of 
selected students regarding the language, an online questionnaire and a focus group 
interview were administered. The findings revealed that, in general, participants held a 
negative attitude towards Nigerian Pidgin English. In conclusion, prejudices against NPE 
continue to exist and date back to the colonial era, when the language was perceived as a 
low and corrupted language (Akande & Salami 2010).

1. Introduction 
1.1. Background 
In a speech community, language attitudes involve social meanings in relation to social-
cultural norms. The study of language attitudes is crucial because it can shed light on how 
shifts and maintenance in a language are contingent on whether members of the speech 
community like or dislike it (Mann 1997). It contributes to understanding the social 
significance of a given language or code and the use of language as a symbol of identity 
(Salami 1991; Adegbija 1994; Ihemere 2006). Prior research on Nigeria's linguistic 
environment revealed the complexity of the country's indigenous sociolinguistics context. 
According to Adegbija (1994: 75), there are over 500 spoken languages in Nigeria. As a 
result, Nigerian society is multilingual, leaving room for the adoption of English as the 
country's official and secondary language. Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba are constitutionally 
recognized as major indigenous languages in Nigeria, endowing them with a formal status 
among the country's linguistic diversity. In contrast, Nigerian Pidgin English holds a 
unique position with both exogenous and indigenous characteristics (Adegbija 2004: 46). 
Nigerian Pidgin is spoken by approximately 3-5 million individuals as their native 
language, while an additional 75 million people use it as a second language (Ihemere 
2006). Faraclas (2021) provides a more recent estimation, indicating that the number of 
Nigerian Pidgin speakers in Nigeria exceeds 110 million, affirming its notable numerical 
strength. 
 
The language with the most speakers in Nigeria, Nigerian Pidgin English, developed 
through historical contact between English and other indigenous languages in Nigeria

(Dada 2007: 87).1 Its generative and dynamic capabilities have continued to support the 
country's interaction and communication processes. It is regarded by Akande & Salami 
(2010) as a distorted form of English and the language of illiterates, and its use has 
therefore been used as a measure of one's English proficiency. Nonetheless, Nigerian 
Pidgin English has assumed an important communicative role among Nigeria's diverse 
cultural groups that do not share the same language. According to Akande (2008), NPE 
is the dominant language of Nigeria's educated elites, including graduates, lawyers, 
professors, and journalists. It has been demonstrated that NPE is also used in popular 
advertisements, other public service announcements, local political debates, and radio 
(Durodola 2013). Therefore, it is untrue that only illiterates or those without a formal 
education use NPE (Agheyisi 1984). On the contrary, educated users can speak both NPE 
and Standard Nigerian English, the latter of which enjoys widespread acceptance and 
used in diverse formal contexts within the nation (Akande 2008). 
 
Unlike English and the other three major languages mentioned above in Nigeria, NPE is 
not recognised by the government and is subject to marginalisation. Evidently, a 
prevailing perception among the Nigerian elite is that Nigerian pidgin is predominantly 
perceived as a contact language devoid of any discernible ethnic or regional association 
(Balogun 2013). Consequently, it is relegated to the periphery of social acceptance owing 
to its perceived lack of influential impact. Like other indigenous languages, English is 
taught as a subject in Nigerian schools and universities, but neither a school nor a 
department teaches Nigerian Pidgin English. This suggests that NPE is receiving less 
emphasis in the Nigerian educational system and the government's apparent lack of 
interest in promoting NPE could be a factor in its continued marginalisation. 
 
The increasing use of NPE by Nigerians has helped raise the status of the language in the 
country. Despite lacking official recognition, it is still widely spoken and used in 
contemporary Nigeria. Since NPE is the only language used by many Nigerians, educated 
and uneducated, regardless of ethnicity and identity (Akande & Salami 2010), one could 
argue that it has facilitated the dissemination of national ideas and linguistic, 
sociocultural, and political developments. It has been observed, however, that many 
adults, including teachers and high-ranking government officials, disapprove of its use in 
formal and informal settings by adolescents and young adults (Akande & Salami 2010: 
72). Despite its numerous seemingly beneficial practical applications, Nigerian Pidgin 
continues to be an undervalued language.  
 
1.2. Problem statement 
What began as a contact language between black traders and British colonialists is now 
the primary language spoken by most Nigerian students in educational institutions, 
outside and inside the classroom. Nigerian students frequently use non-standard forms of 
communication, such as code-switching and NPE, due to their multilingualism. Since 
Standard English is the only acceptable medium of instruction used for teaching and 
learning in tertiary institutions and secondary schools in Nigeria, students are regularly 
cautioned not to employ NPE, with potential financial penalties for its use during school

support and direction throughout the completion of this paper. I would also like to express my gratitude to 
those who took the time to fill out the questionnaire and provide feedback, as well as those who 
participated in the interview; your cooperation made this research possible.

hours (Ojarikre 2013).  In light of this context, this study investigates the attitudes of 
Coventry University (CU) Nigerian students towards the use of NPE and the possibility 
of its official recognition.  
 
1.3.Objectives of the study 
This study aims to discover the following. First, an objective would be to determine how 
Nigerian students at CU perceive NPE. The next goal would be to assess the context and 
extent of NPE usage among Nigerian students enrolled at CU. Finally, it hopes to examine 
the perspectives of students regarding the official recognition of NPE in key Nigerian 
domains2. 
 
1.4. Rationale and possible significance 
As a result of this diachronic change and growth, NPE has become popular among 
Nigerians both within and beyond Nigeria. The significance of this study lies in the fact 
that its findings can shed light on the perceptions and attitudes of Nigerian CU students 
towards NPE and the potential for its status to be elevated. This work may raise awareness 
of the language's usage in the diaspora. It will help determine how widely NPE is used in 
the diaspora. Given Akande's (2008) claim that NPE is a marker of solidarity and identity, 
it is crucial to ascertain whether NPE among Nigerian students at CU serves any 
solidarity-marking function.  
 
2. Literature Review  
2.1. The origin of Nigerian Pidgin English  
Controversy surrounds the emergence of pidgin and creole contact languages (Siegel 
2008: 6). Despite numerous academic hypotheses, the origin of pidgin remains obscure. 
Late in the 18th century, West African Pidgin, also known as the Creole language of the 
Guinean coast, emerged (Holm 1988: 426). It is a creole and pidgin language based on 
English that is used throughout Nigeria and beyond (Deuber 2005: 183). It is intriguing 
to note that pidgin languages generally involve business or trade contacts between 
individuals from culturally diverse groups.  NPE is connected to a group of English 
lexifier pidgins and creoles spoken in various African diaspora communities and along 
the coast of West Africa across the Atlantic Basin. Cameroonian Pidgin is more similar 
to NPE than Jamaican Krio or Sierra Leonean Pidgin (Owusu, Adoma & Aboagye 2016: 
541). Notwithstanding, these pidgins and creoles share a wide range of phonological, 
grammatical, and semantic features (Faraclas 2013). The colonial government, social 
conditions, and the introduction of schools by missionaries all contributed to the 
development and diffusion of the language (Adegbija 1994: 16). According to Jenkins' 
(2003: 10) assertion, pidgin languages initially developed to satisfy the limited 
communication requirements of individuals3 who do not share a common language. In a 
similar manner, Elugbe & Omamor (1991) assert that the origin of NPE derived from 
contact between visiting European merchants and multilingual coastal communities, first 
in Portuguese, then Dutch, and finally English. 
 
According to Egbokhare (2003) and Deuber (2005), the Niger Delta is the birthplace of 
NPE, where it has acquired native speakers (Holm 2000), from which it is believed to 
 
2 For “domain”, I use the definition provided in Holmes & Wilson (2017).

unwavering love, support, and encouragement, without whom this paper would not be possible.

have spread to other regions and acquired speakers. In particular, it was already spoken 
in the Niger Delta region's coastal states (Ogu 1992), and its use was restricted to 
commercial transactions (Agheyisi 1984). As a lingua franca among speakers of mutually 
incomprehensible languages, NPE is likely to evolve over time in a multilingual country 
like Nigeria, where it serves more and more functions (Buba, Al-Shujairi & Ya’u 2016). 
When Pidgin is nativized by a speech community, a creole develops (Todd 2003), and as 
a mother tongue, it is capable of expressing diverse facets of human thought and emotion. 
According to Holm (2000: 6), generally, creole is descended from pidgin because it is 
spoken as a first language by a multilingual speech community. Therefore, a speech 
community cannot be conceptualised as a group of speakers who speak the same language 
but rather as a group that shares the same language norms (Daoust 1997). Throughout 
history, it has maintained contact with both the substrate and lexifier languages (Deuber 
2005). Under British colonial rule, English became the official language of Nigeria, 
despite the fact that the vast majority of Nigerians speak indigenous languages as their 
native tongue. However, Nigerian Pidgin English serves as a supplementary medium of 
communication in restricted informal contexts because it has acquired some functions in 
other formal domains (Akande 2008) and is now a common language among educated 
Nigerians having informal conversations. Thus, Nigerian Pidgin English is not a dialect 
of English like Australian or American English. It has been viewed as a hybrid of African 
languages (Gennadievna 2019). 
 
2.2. Uses and functions of Nigerian Pidgin English  
According to Labov (1990: 9), the term "pidgin" generally refers to a contact language 
resulting from interaction between speakers of a socially subordinate language and 
speakers of a culturally dominant language. A Pidgin community demonstrates linguistic 
diversity. Nigeria is exemplary of an African colonial state that is multilingual, 
pluralistic4, and heterogeneous (Ogunmodimu 2015). It is necessary to investigate the use 
of NPE to comprehend the country's social structure. Jowitt (1991) shows that the use of 
Pidgin in Nigeria signifies familiarity and informality. It has recently earned the respect 
of both literate and illiterate members of society (Akande 2008). According to Deuber 
2005), the primary domain of use for NPE and other Nigerian Indigenous languages is 
informal as opposed to formal. As a result, NPE is a common lingua franca used in 
informal communication, as many Nigerians are proficient in the English language, which 
they employ with ease when discussing matters of more than local importance. Moreover, 
it serves as a political tool, as it is now widely employed for mass mobilisation, public 
announcements, political campaigns, and government propaganda. It is also widely used 
in advertising as a means of identifying with the average person (Adegbija 2004). 
 
Since the first poem written in Nigerian Pidgin English (Egbokhare 2003), the language 
has served an intellectual purpose. Its prevalence in media, advertising, radio, and 
television confers a great deal of visibility on a language deemed incorrect or malformed. 
Elugbe & Omamor (1991) view Pidgin as a marginal language that arose to serve 
communication purposes in specific contexts. It is widely used in the country as a second 
language, and the number of native speakers is growing. Based on the preceding 
definition, it can be asserted that pidgin is not recognized as an official language; rather, 
 
4 It is pluralistic in the sense that it is a diverse country with various ethnic, cultural, religious, and 
linguistic groups.

50 
its usage is limited to facilitating communication among individuals who possess varied 
linguistic and social backgrounds. 
 
2.3. Language policy on education in Nigeria 
The current language policy on education in Nigeria acknowledges roles for all 
indigenous languages but does not specify any role for Nigerian Pidgin English in 
education, despite the recognition of the role of indigenous languages in the early years 
of schooling (NPE 2013). The languages of the immediate environment are used as the 
medium of instruction in primary education. For example, in the context of a primary 
school situated within a demographically Yoruba-dominant community in Nigeria, 
Yoruba emerges as one among the languages of the immediate environment. It is 
noteworthy that the students within this locality predominantly employ Yoruba as their 
primary language of communication within familial contexts. Consequently, the 
educational institution in question may opt to employ Yoruba as the medium of 
instruction. This strategic selection is rooted in the pedagogical principle of leveraging 
languages of the immediate environment to facilitate effective early education. English is 
used in numerous facets of Nigeria's multilingualism, including educational, 
communication, national, institutional, policy-related, and symbolic functions. However, 
other indigenous Nigerian languages, particularly Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba are regarded 
as instruments for cultural enrichment, symbols of Nigerian independence, and vehicles 
for nationalism (Adegbija 2004). 
 
Nigerian Pidgin English, on the other hand, is an ethnically neutral language that serves 
as a lingua franca in Nigeria's informal domains. It is now the most widely spoken 
language in Nigeria and the multilingual speech communities of the diaspora. Despite 
these dynamics, Nigeria's language policy has yet to address the status of NPE (Adegbija 
2004). 
 
2.4. Attitudes towards Nigerian Pidgin English within the familial domain 
Positive or negative attitudes towards languages are frequently influenced by the 
language standardisation process (Garrett 2010). Fasold (1984) identifies two approaches 
to the study of language attitudes: cognitive and behaviourist. The former is concerned 
with the responses of language users to social situations in a language, while the latter 
views attitudes as an internal state of readiness used to predict other behaviours (Ihemere 
2006). Language attitudes possess a unique characteristic that sets them apart from other 
types of attitudes, namely their direct focus on languages themselves and the way they 
shape individual and collective identities. The mentalist framework makes behavioural 
inferences to account for the direct study of the mental state of language users. As a result, 
this study employs a mentalist methodology, as attitudes towards language frequently 
reflect attitudes towards individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds (Fasold 1984). 
 
Even though most Nigerians speak NPE (Faraclas 2008; Igboanusi 2008) and both 
educated and illiterate Nigerians use it (Akande 2008), the attitudes of many Nigerian 
citizens remain overwhelmingly negative. Some Nigerian families use it as their native 
language. However, the characterization of NPE as English that has been corrupted or 
broken is indicative of a negative attitude towards this language. In contemporary 
Nigerian society, people tend to view NPE as a corrupt or inferior language (Mann 1996; 
Igboanusi 2008). However, it plays an important role in the lives of Nigerians but lacks 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63 
 
 
51 
the socioeconomic prestige of English. Parents and students consequently view education 
in indigenous languages or NPE as detrimental. 
 
Ogunmodimu (2015: 159) argues that a country as linguistically diverse as Nigeria could 
benefit from adopting a multilingual language policy in which all languages are accorded 
due recognition according to their function. A major argument in favour of NPE’s 
adoption as Nigeria's official language is that it is an ethnically neutral code. Igboanusi 
(2008) further argues that elementary schools should use NPE as a medium of instruction 
for NPE-speaking students. The language is currently unrecognised5 despite efforts by 
advocates for its official recognition (Elugbe & Omamor 1991); Egbokhare (2003). As 
such, these negative attitudes can be attributed to the weak power position of NPE 
speakers. 
 
3. Methodology 
This study is predicated on a mixed-methods research approach that permits the 
exploration of diverse perspectives and the discovery of relationships among multifaceted 
research questions. In this study, the advantages and disadvantages of qualitative and 
quantitative methods were combined, resulting in a more cohesive research design.  
 
3.1. Research questions: 
This study sought to answer the following research questions: 
1. To what extent and in what contexts do Nigerian students at CU use Nigerian 
Pidgin English? 
2. What is the perception of Nigerian students at CU towards NPE? 
3. What are Nigerian students' views towards the official recognition of NPE in 
certain key domains in the country? 
 
3.2. Sample selection and size 
This research employs two methods of data collection: a 10-minute online questionnaire 
and a 30-minute focus group interview. 22 Nigerian undergraduate and graduate students 
currently enrolled at CU responded to the online survey, while four (two male and two 
female) Nigerian undergraduate and graduate students participated in the focus group 
interview. Stratified purposive sampling was used to select the sample for this study. Even 
though students were selected at random from various disciplines, each participant was 
required to be a Nigerian-born undergraduate or graduate student at CU. 
 
3.3. Instrumentation 
3.3.1. Questionnaire 
The online questionnaire for participants consisted of fifteen closed questions (see Table 
1) about their usage, attitudes, and perspectives regarding Nigerian Pidgin English. These 
questions were partially adapted from Akande & Salami (2010). Although closed 
questions lack spontaneity and expressiveness (Oppenheim 2005), they offer a variety of 
alternative responses to respondents. 
 
 
5 In this context "unrecognised" means that Nigerian Pidgin is not officially acknowledged, endorsed, or 
accepted as a formal or legitimate language within formal institutions, such as the educational system or 
government. It lacks official recognition or status, which can result in limited or no support, resources, or 
inclusion in official policies or programs.

52 
3.3.2. Focus group interview 
A semi-structured focus group interview was conducted to discuss their perceptions of 
NPE in more detail. Seven open-ended questions prompted interviewees to elaborate on 
their general perspectives, attitudes, and use of Nigerian Pidgin English. 
 
3.4. Data Analysis 
Regarding the analysis of responses to the questionnaire, responses from participants 
were distributed according to polar and non-polar questions. The responses have been 
converted to percentages using a simple statistical instrument and tabular frequency. This 
is required as the obtained data is quantitative and fixed. Thematic analysis was used to 
identify patterns or themes within the qualitative data to interpret them. The framework 
of thematic analysis provided by Braun & Clarke (2006) was used to analyse the focus 
interview data because it provides a clear and usable structure for thematic analysis. 
 
4. Online Questionnaire 
4.1. Results 
According to Table 1, 77.3% of Nigerian students in CU agree that NPE is a language, 
whereas 22.7% disagree. The percentage of students who view NPE as a language is 
greater than that of those who do not, as shown by the data presented below. Similarly, 
72.7% of participants believe that NPE is an English dialect, while 27.3% disagree.

Regarding the use of NPE, 81.8% of Nigerian students at CU claim to use the language, 
compared to 18.2% who say they do not. Furthermore, 68.2% of students indicate that 
they do not read any magazines or books written in Pidgin English, while only 31.8% 
indicate that they do. As shown in the table above, 77.3% of respondents agree that more 
television programmes should be produced in Nigerian Pidgin, while 22.7% disagree. 
This is consistent with Elugbe & Omamor (1991) assertion that Pidgin English in Nigeria 
is a spoken language that has successfully maintained a vital and robust oral literature.

In addition, 77.3% of respondents disagree that Nigerian Pidgin English should be taught 
in Nigerian schools, while 22.7% of respondents agree. Similarly, 81.8% are opposed to 
the use of the language as a medium of instruction in primary school, whereas 18.2% are 
in favour. On the topic of the official recognition of Nigerian Pidgin English, fifty percent 
of respondents agree that it should be adopted as the official language of Nigeria, while 
the remaining fifty percent disagree completely. 
 
Presented below are the responses to the non-polar questions “What Category of people 
do you think speak Nigerian Pidgin English?” (Table 2) and “When did you start learning 
Nigerian Pidgin English?” (Table 3).

81.8% of the participants at CU agree that NPE is spoken by all categories of Nigerians; 
18.2% of respondents say that the language is spoken by illiterate Nigerians; and none of 
the respondents claimed that only literate Nigerians speak it (Table 2). According to the 
data presented in Table 2, Nigerian students at CU hold positive views of NPE in its role 
as a tool for fostering effective communication and bridging gaps among speakers from 
different ethnic backgrounds and encompassing various social categories.

Table 3 shows the statistical analysis of when participants first learned NPE. The results 
indicate that 40.9% of participants acquired the language at elementary school and 31.1% 
at secondary school. This indicates that most students acquired the language at a young 
age; consequently, negative transfer6 and fossilisation issues may arise when 
communicating using standard Nigerian English.

54.5% of respondents do not encourage or accept the use of the language in schools, even 
at the discretion of teachers. 27.3% are in favour of its use in schools, while 18.2% of 
these respondents are neutral and neither agree nor disagree with this statement.

Table 7 demonstrates that 54.5% of Nigerian students claim to be able to express their 
feelings, desires, and thoughts in any area of communication using NPE. According to 
45.5% of these students, these can only be used occasionally, not always, depending on 
the context. Respondents seem to agree that NPE has the potential to convey at least some 
of the student's thoughts and emotions. 
 
4.2. Discussion 
A large proportion of Nigerian students at CU use NPE occasionally, according to the 
findings of the data analysis presented in Table 5 above. More importantly, the students' 
perception of the language leans predominantly towards negativity, particularly in its role 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63 
 
 
55 
as a language for formal education. This contradicts the findings of Buba, Al-Shujairi & 
Ya’u (2016), in which NPE was viewed favourably. This may have happened because 
NPE is viewed by these students as a threat to the English language, which they consider 
to be the ‘real one', while NPE is viewed as a form of English in miserable disguise 
(Adegbija 2004: 129). Over 70% of the students in Table 1 agree that NPE is both a 
language and a variety of the English language. 
 
Based on Table 2, it seems that students consider NPE in a way as a neutral language, 
without the ethnic connotations of the indigenous languages nor the elitist connotations 
of English. Consequently, literate Nigerian students at CU are not an exception, as the 
findings indicate that a significant number of students use it in the multicultural and 
heterogeneous society in which they reside. The available data in Table 7 indicates that 
NPE serves more than a limited purpose, as it is used in every conceivable aspect of their 
daily lives and can express the participants' thoughts, emotions, opinions, and desires 
regardless of the domain they are engaged in. 
 
Even though most Nigerians both inside and outside of the country use NPE, 50% of the 
participants in Table 1 disagree with its official recognition in Nigeria. The results 
indicate that the lack of status of Nigerian Pidgin English is because speaking the 
language alone confers no social advantage on its speakers. As a result, the negative 
attitude of these participants towards the official adoption of NPE may be a result of their 
inability to read and write in NPE as they can in English, which they believe allows them 
to advance in society. Therefore, NPE is less prevalent among Nigerian students at CU. 
 
Moreover, Nigerian students at CU use NPE more frequently in social settings, like 
informal meetings or casual get-togethers with friends and/or family, than at home or in 
the classroom. The occasional use of NPE by these Nigerian students may have resulted 
from their linguistic background and the small number (13.6%) of Nigerian students who 
use NPE frequently for communication as presented in Table 5 above. It should be noted, 
however, that the majority of university students do not support the use of Nigerian pidgin 
as a medium of instruction in primary school, nor do they accept its use in Nigerian 
schools. This is one way in which the language in Nigeria has been marginalised. Mann 
(1993), as cited in Adegbija (2004: 130), contends that despite the essential services, 
social prestige, and credibility that NPE provides, it has yet to be officially recognised as 
an official language, and as a result, the sociolinguistic survival of the language is neither 
guaranteed nor assured. 
 
5. Focus Group Interview  
5.1. Themes 
Three themes and a total of seven subthemes were identified during the focus group 
interview (Table 8). The three major themes are based on the study's three research 
questions: "use of NPE with an emphasis on the how and why of NPE," "perceptions of 
Nigerian Pidgin," and "recognition of NPE".

5.2. Discussion 
5.2.1. Use of Nigerian Pidgin English  
In the four-person language-based focus group discussion, NPE was variously described 
as “a language in its own right,” “not proper,” “unrecognised,” and “English mixed with 
local stuff”. One respondent, referring to NPE as a variety of English, stated, “Pidgin is a 
broken piece of English that is mixed together in order to communicate". Another 
participant argued that “the British should have the final say because it is their language 
to begin with”. In the discussion, the significance of NPE usage was also evident. Three 
respondents stated that NPE was their primary language for social activities: 
Moderator: do you use Nigerian Pidgin very often? 
Participant 2: I use it mostly when I want to get into someone…. it’s just like 
be free with the person like you…peers….   
Participant 1: I think I use it frequently not with anybody but mainly friends 
just made purposely for social activities…. Yeah, I think it shows more 
connection that we have in common…. you understand we are people from 
almost different ethnicity and other things.  
 
It is evident that NPE is predominantly used with friends, family, and in other informal 
contexts. According to Deuber (2005), the use of NPE conveys endearment and signifies 
familiarity and friendship. It is therefore consistent with Ndimele's (2016) assertion that 
NPE is significantly excluded from both educational and official domains, while it is 
heavily utilised in informal domains. 
 
In the following statement, participant 4 acknowledges using NPE on occasion but 
primarily at the market: 
Moderator: How often do you use Pidgin English? 
Participant 4: not often…I only use Pidgin if I’m in the market [in Nigeria] 
… 
Moderator: why’s that? Do you think people in the market are less educated? 
What’s your reason for that? 
Participant 4: I only use Pidgin if I am in the market because you don’t know 
if the person can understand what you are saying if you speak English…. I 
just feel like that’s the best way you can speak with them… 
 
According to the participant's comments, the use of NPE in interethnic business contacts 
in different regions of Nigeria is functionally unparalleled. This may be because its origin 
and history are rooted in this field on both individual and societal levels. This is consistent 
with Adegbija's (2004) assertion that the predominant use of NPE in Nigerian markets 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63 
 
 
57 
demonstrates that it is a language of interethnic communication used for soliciting and 
price haggling. This participant's predominant use of NPE in the marketplace 
demonstrates that it is a language of informality and socialisation. Consequently, its use 
in the commercial realm serves not only to facilitate negotiations but also to foster 
solidarity. As a result, NPE is regarded as a useful means of communication due to its 
simple structure and widespread use, particularly in a nation as linguistically and 
culturally diverse as Nigeria. 
 
Moderator: Does Pidgin have the capacity to express every area of your 
thoughts and feelings? 
Participant 1: of course, yes…of course like most times I have to express 
myself using pidgin you know…there are some situations you will find 
yourself and you will just have this thing you want to express and the best way 
you could express it is using Pidgin … 
Participant 2: yeah…well I think it is same for local languages as 
well……laughs… 
Clearly, participant 1 uses NPE to express a variety of desires, emotions, thoughts, and 
beliefs, while participant 2 suggests the same is true for local languages. Participant 2 is 
more interested in other local languages than in NPE. 
 
5.2.2. Perceptions towards Nigerian Pidgin English  
Two of these respondents appear to oppose the use of NPE within the Nigerian 
educational system. They believe that the coexistence of English and NPE would cause 
problems in the Nigerian educational system. These participants recognised that the 
coexistence of these two languages, English and NPE, would hinder the effective 
acquisition of Standard English. This is evidenced by the following statement: 
Moderator: From its widespread use, do you think it should be one of the 
mediums of instruction in primary schools?  
Participant 2: personally, I don’t think so because there will be like huge 
margin the way you handle professional life and the way you do it with your 
peers…because let’s say you go international now it’s going to affect how we 
professionally communicate in Standard English… 
Participant 3: you can’t take it to the professional world to express word to 
express feelings…I mean a corporate world you can’t do that…you need 
proper English to relate with people all over the world as well…. 
 
Considering that NPE has always been referred to as a substandard language and viewed 
as inferior, the evaluation of these Nigerian students' perceptions of NPE at CU further 
confirms that. As a result, the participant was opposed to its use in schools and the 
incorporation of NPE into the curriculum of primary schools in Nigeria. This result is 
consistent with the findings of Akande and Salami (2010), whose study revealed that 
neither students from the University of Benin nor those from University of Lagos hold a 
favourable view of the use or instruction of NPE in Nigerian schools. The result reveals 
that two of these respondents oppose its use in the Nigerian educational curriculum. 
Significantly, the remaining two respondents (Participants 1 and 4) believe that NPE is 
undervalued and worthy of international recognition: 
Participant 1: logically I think it should...my reason is because if you look at 
South Africa they have 15 languages and their schools are channelled to if a 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63 
 
 
58 
child understands a language better, he or she can be sent to the school that 
teaches with that particular language...if Nigeria could adopt this system that 
if a child can understand more of ‘Broken’ then the child will be taught with 
Broken I think that’s cool… 
Participant 4: I think Pidgin should be adopted in the educational system 
because if you find yourself maybe outside Nigeria like people from different 
ethnicity...it’s a way for people to communicate in a better way...that’s my 
own opinion... 
 
Therefore, it is suggested that NPE should be used in schools in Nigeria where students 
understand NPE better than English. Participant 1 believes that students will learn more 
effectively if they are instructed in their native language, as this will eliminate the initial 
shock of learning a new language. Therefore, the Nigerian language policy should 
logically result in the development of NPE as the official medium of instruction in 
Nigerian schools. 
 
Moreover, participant 2 demonstrates a strong affinity for and preference for indigenous 
languages over Pidgin English. In his statement: 
Participant 2: yeah, in my own view we have local languages and I think it 
is better to reinforce our local languages than Pidgin… 
 
Even though NPE is spoken by all ethnic groups and is more popular than the three major 
languages: Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba (Elugbe & Omamor 1991), as well as the language's 
perceived neutrality, Participant 2 continues to advocate for the promotion of indigenous 
languages over NPE. Dooga (2012) asserted that losing one's language entails losing one's 
culture and heritage, as well as a substantial portion of the nation's origin, because as 
language declines, so do cultural norms. As a result, it is possible that the participant 
believed that choosing NPE over our native languages could result in a loss of cultural 
values and identity. 
 
5.2.3. Recognition of Nigerian Pidgin English   
Participants are consistent and lucid regarding what constitutes a potential candidate for 
official language status, and they have provided concrete suggestions for enhancing 
NPE's acceptability and standing. What students want for NPE is rooted in the challenges 
of understanding its status and prestige, the need for further development, and the 
perception that NPE poses a threat to standard NPE. Participants favour a language that 
accommodates both individual and societal viewpoints. 
Moderator: my question now is that since one can express his/herself using 
Pidgin…and other important functions it performs…do you think it should 
have an official status in Nigeria? Being the fact that different ethnicity can 
speak it…do you think it should be officially recognised in Nigeria?...  
Participant 2: there will be like huge margin…the way you handle our 
professional life and the way you do it with your peers…because let me say 
you go international now and it’s going to affect how we professionally 
communicate in standard English….  
 
Instead of advocating for the official recognition of NPE, Participant 2 prefers 
English as the official language and medium of instruction in Nigerian schools. 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63 
 
 
59 
Participant 2: I know what you mean but uhm mm…because my own support 
is an international language first of all like proper English… and like having 
Pidgin in the education is going to be a problem….  
 
Participant 2's statement hints at a comparison with standard Nigerian English. Participant 
2's partial opposition to the official recognition of NPE can be attributed to the prejudice 
that the language lacks international acceptability and intelligibility and is viewed as a 
corrupt form of English. Also, due to its lack of linguistic development (Deuber 2005), 
this participant believes that a language must have social prestige, be an international 
language, and have widespread usage as well as international acceptability and 
intelligibility to qualify as a country's official language, just as English does. 
 
Nonetheless, Participant 1 articulated the need to increase recognition of Nigerian Pidgin 
English. He further explains that the use of NPE by Nigerians unifies the nation. An 
example is the frequency with which the keyword "unity" was mentioned. 
Participant 1: Well for me I think when it’s given more awareness, more 
acceptability, it will unite us. You know because part of the basic element of 
development is unity and unity start with communication, regardless of your 
locality, if I can understand you, you discover that we are going to be close 
friends…  
 
Three of the respondents who supported the official recognition of NPE in Nigeria cited 
its widespread use by Nigerian citizens and its status as a neutral language that connects 
Nigerians across social and ethnic lines. They believed that NPE is inextricably learned 
in society because it does not require formal education and is simple to comprehend. 
Participants identified and acknowledged its use and significance; therefore, it cannot be 
ignored. 
Participant 3: within Nigeria yes because it’s already been used by a lot of 
people like majority of Nigerians use it…so…why not just recognise it yeah… 
Participant 2: in that point of view, I think maybe we can have uhmm…maybe 
another form of English, you know we move English aside and Pidgin 
aside...you know…it’s because I can see from where this is going...we can 
have written English and then pidgin aside so we can know like to create 
awareness so they discover the difference between Standard and pidgin 
English becomes the main…we have this aside and the other aside. 
 
Participant 3 supports the recognition of NPE because most of the population now speaks 
it. Participant 2 concludes by advocating for a policy that recognises NPE as an official 
language while retaining English for diplomatic purposes, higher education, and 
international communication. In my personal view, NPE has survived despite opposition 
because it serves primarily as a fallback language when there is a need for communication 
between people of different ethnicities. 
 
Perhaps the most notable result observed is that for these participants, NPE is a more 
plausible and desirable candidate than other indigenous languages for the status of official 
language, as they acknowledged that it is a unifying language that is widely used by most 
Nigerians, as stated by Participant 1 below: 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63 
 
 
60 
Participant 1: because one unique thing about the language is that despite 
ethnicity from Nigeria or even Africa…you discover that 80% can understand 
each other when they are speaking Broken….  
 
Participant 1 referred to NPE as “Broken”. This is consistent with the findings of Faraclas 
(2008 and Igboanusi (2008), which indicate that most Nigerians speak NPE. Even those 
who maintain the language by speaking it continue to refuse to acknowledge or recognise 
it. In my perspective, given the diminished social prestige associated with this language, 
there exists a notable disparity between acknowledging the occasional use of NPE and 
being recognised as someone who speaks NPE. Consequently, it is evident that the 
language has survived and flourished because it is readily accessible and useful, filling a 
communication void in Nigeria. 
 
These findings indicate that despite the issues surrounding NPE, such as low social 
prestige and perception as a low or corrupt language, it is widely used among these 
students due to its usefulness, simplicity, and significance. The sociolinguistic reality 
among these Nigerian students at CU demonstrates that both literate and illiterate 
members of society speak NPE, supporting Akande's (2008) claim that both groups use 
the language. The research revealed that there are numerous negative perceptions of NPE. 
These perceptions have resulted in a string of disparaging views of NPE as an improper 
or corrupted form of the English language. As a result, others have started to view the 
language as subpar, inferior, marginal, and adulterated (Deuber 2005). The results 
revealed these degrading qualifications, which explain why these Nigerian students at CU 
use NPE as an oral mode of communication. NPE as a language is without a doubt widely 
used, spoken, and understood by these Nigerian students at CU. Based on an analysis of 
the interview data, it has been determined that these students use NPE primarily at social 
gatherings7. This suggests that the language is used more frequently with their peers. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The perception of NPE, particularly in relation to its applicability in education, 
demonstrates a lack of favourable sentiment, as revealed by the outcomes of both the 
online questionnaire and the focus group discussion. This finding holds significance as it 
signifies a discernible division of opinions regarding the official status of NPE (Buba, Al-
Shujairi & Ya’u 2016). Furthermore, the data indicates the existence of varying degrees 
of prejudice among Nigerian students at CU, and there is presently no indication of 
imminent alterations in the existing language policy and practice. The findings contradict 
the claim that Nigerian college students have the most positive attitude (Elugbe & 
Omamor 1991). This could be due to inadequate language development. In the absence 
of literature and orthography, NPE cannot effectively compete with other Nigerian 
languages for government recognition. Since it is not developed and does not play a role 
in formal education, it is not the linguistic superiority of the English language that places 
it above NPE, but rather the value that Nigeria and the rest of the world place on it. In 
contrast to indigenous languages, NPE has not been evaluated in any of the country's 
formal education systems. This is a direct result of the government's lack of interest 
(Elugbe & Omamor 1991). 
 
7 The use of NPE in a social gathering refers to a gathering of people in a relaxed and casual setting where 
they come together for social interaction, enjoyment, and informal conversations. These gatherings can 
take various forms, such as parties, get-togethers, hangouts, or other informal events. 

SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics. Volume 21 (2023): 46 – 63

The lack of NPE development in Nigeria could be responsible for the negative perception 
(Elugbe & Omamor 1991). NPE lacks a standardised orthography because there have 
been no efforts to expand its lexicon and there is no codified standard variety of the 
language (Deuber 2005). Consequently, the results of the focus group interview may be 
described as promising for a non-standardised language that suffers most from low social 
prestige and lacks official recognition. It could be argued that the significance and 
benefits of NPE have not yet been fully exploited in the nation's policy planning. Since it 
is a national language and the only ethnically neutral language, it could be viewed as an 
asset. According to the findings of the study, proposals to expand and officially recognise 
the functions of NPE are not without merit. Due to socio-political developments, it is 
difficult to predict whether NPE will surpass its unofficial recognition and become an 
officially recognised language (Deuber 2005). However, due to the increasing popularity 
and widespread use of the language in Nigeria and the diaspora, it will continue to play 
an important role in the sociolinguistic context of Nigeria.
