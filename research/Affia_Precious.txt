Abstract 
This study examines plural marking in Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) in light of language 
change. The plural marking strategies used in NPE are the morphological plural -s, postnominal 
dem, zero marking and reduplication of adjectives/nouns, double marking, numerals and 
quantifiers as analyzed in previous studies (Tagliamonte et al 1997, Ogunmodimu 2014). The 
idea for the language change analysis is that older studies show that dem or null marking are the 
most common plural marking strategies in NPE (Faraclas 1989, Mafeni 1971, Agheyisi 1971), 
while more recent studies (Tagliamonte et al. 1997, Ogunmodimu 2014) show that the plural 
marker -s is dominant in the language, while dem is disappearing. The current study arose from 
the question of the disappearance of dem as a plural marker in NPE as obtained from previous 
research. I believe an explanation for this disappearance could be that there is a change in the 
language as it relates to the use of plural markers. While previous studies have examined some 
linguistic and social factors that may influence the use of these markers (e.g. -s being sensitive to 
animacy and nominal reference (Tagliamonte et al. 1997) and dem to education (Ogunmodimu 
2014), none of these works have looked at the variable- plural marking as a function of language 
change. In this thesis, I investigate age, gender and dominant language as factors that may 
influence the choice of plural markers used by NPE speakers in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I also 
investigate linguistic factors such as animacy, type of determiner and nominal reference, 
precipitated by a previous study by Tagliamonte et al. (1997). To better test for change in 
progress, the data of the study is collected through sociolinguistic interviews conducted in NPE, 
with 20 participants divided into two generations (older and younger) and gender (male and 
female) evenly distributed. All the speakers are immigrants in Winnipeg who have spent most of 
their lives in Nigeria to be able to acquire NPE. The results of the study suggest change in 

ii 
 
progress occurring in plural marking from the older use of zero marking to newer -s marking, as 
-s is still the dominant plural used in this study. Gender, dominant language and the interaction 
of age and gender are found to be significant factors in the choice of plural used by the speakers. 
The result that dominant language is significant supports the hypotheses of previous literature 
(Tagliamonte et al 1997 and Ogunmodimu 2014).

Chapter 1: Background of Study 
1.1 Nigeria and its languages 
Nigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, with over 196 million people (Akinyemi 
2014). It is a multilingual nation and home to over 250 ethnic groups speaking over 500 
languages, reflecting the great cultural diversity in the country (Reed & Mberu 2014). It is made 
up of thirty-six states, with each state divided into local government areas. Figure 1 below is the 
map of Nigeria showing the location of the thirty-six states within the geographical zones and the 
Federal Capital Territory- Abuja (Gayawan, Arogundade, & Adebayo 2014). In each state, 5 or 
more languages are spoken. The exact number of languages in Nigeria is difficult to ascertain 
because Nigeria is known for its extreme linguistic diversity with multiplicity of languages 
(Omachonu 2015). It is however estimated in Blench (2012) that there are about 550 languages 
spoken in Nigeria. English and NPE are used as languages of wider communication and for 
interaction between people of different ethnic groups (Omachonu 2015). Nigeria has three 
dominant ethnic groups which are the Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa/Fulani. Other ethnic groups 
include the Efik, Ibibio, Anaang, Ijaw, Urhobo-Isoko, Edo, Itsekiri and others.

The English language, which was adopted from the British Colonial Government, is the 
official language of the country, while Nigerian Pidgin English is used as a social language with 
no official status attributed to it. Social language here means an informal language that Nigerians 
use when conversing with family members, friends and in informal situations in Nigeria, outside 
Nigeria and among Nigerians. Agheyisi (1988), explains that in the past, NPE served primarily 
as a trade language in markets and other informal commercial settings, or as a medium of 
interaction with uneducated employees and domestic servants in the past. But more recently, 

3 
 
NPE serves as a lingua franca in entertainment, for newscasting and for public enlightenment, 
even though it does not have any official status (p. 229).  
A national policy on education adopted in Nigeria in 1977 addressed the national 
language question, and this policy was seen as “a bold step and a deliberate plan towards 
national multilingualism” (Afolayan and Bamgbose 1980, p. 220). In the policy, every child is 
encouraged to learn one of the three major languages (i.e. Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa) in addition 
to their own mother tongue. The 1979 constitution of Nigeria, established on October 1st, 1979 
during the administration of President Shehu Shagari, outlined the functional status of different 
languages in the country. English was established as the lingua franca, and Yoruba, Igbo and 
Hausa as the national languages. The national languages, Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, are the three 
main recognized ethnic languages in Nigeria, allowed to be used in national functions such as the 
civil service, law, commerce, education and all other official domains (Ayeomoni 2012). Other 
minor ethnic languages are only officially recognized within their ethnic groups, like Ibibio and 
Efik, spoken in the South-South part of the country (see map of Nigeria in Figure 1, p. 2).   
NPE is not mentioned at all in official language policy of Nigeria. However, while 
English functions as the official code and as a medium of instruction in school, NPE is used in 
informal settings for intra and inter-ethnic communication (Ferguson 1959). It is used as a means 
of communication between speakers who share different native Nigerian languages and among 
family and friends. English enjoys high prestige while NPE has low prestige (Akande 2010). The 
roles of these languages are further discussed below.

1.1.1 English 
The British government first arrived in Lagos in 1851 and formally annexed Nigeria in 1865. 
Before the British government annexation in Lagos, English missionaries had already come to 
Nigeria for evangelistic purposes and had established English-medium schools, spreading both 
the gospel and western-style education. This made English prestigious, as the language spoby the 
educated. As early as 1882, English was officially established as language of instruction by the 
colonial government. The indigenous languages, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, were also taught in 
schools alongside English, but they were not used as the primary means of communication in the 
country. Nigeria officially became a British Protectorate and was colonized in 1901, and English 
became the language of administration (Ogunmodimu 2015) and was used in official domains. 
This colonization lasted until 1960. The 1979 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria 
where sections provide functional status of languages in the country, specified English as the 
lingua franca of the country.  English was established as the official language of the nation, used 
as language of education, media, religion (especially Christianity) and politics, governance and 
law (Ogunmodimu 2015).  Its extensive use today as the official or primary medium of formal 
communication in government, international affairs, the judiciary, education, higher commerce 
and the mass media, along with its function as the language of communication above the local 
level, especially among the educated elite, has rendered it the most prestigious language in the 
country (Agheyisi 1984, pp. 237). 
 
1.1.2 National/Major Languages 
The national languages, Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, are the major languages spoken in Nigeria. 
Yoruba belongs to the Volta-Niger branch of the Niger-Congo family of languages.   Hausa, 

5 
 
though an African language, belongs to West Chadic branch of the Afroasiatic Language family. 
Igbo belongs to the Benue-Congo group of the Niger-Congo language family (Agheyisi 1984).  
These languages have the largest numbers of speakers, with over seventy million speakers of 
Hausa, 24 million speakers of Igbo and 21 million speakers of Yoruba (Adoti 2018). The 
restructuring of the country into three administrative regions;  North East and West effectively 
gave prominence to the sociopolitical importance of the three dominant ethno-linguistic groups, 
namely; the Hausa- speaking people in the North, the Igbo-speaking people in the East and the 
Yorubas in the West (Agheyisi 1984). Arthur Richards was the Governor of Nigeria at the break 
of the second world war (1939 – 1945). Richards constitution established in his regime brought 
about regionalism to Nigeria where the country was divided into North, East and West. In the 
North, the Hausa group was the clear majority, constituting about 55% of the total regional 
population, with the next largest linguistic group in the region, Kanuri, being only about 7.5% 
(Agheyisi, 1984, p. 238). Accordingly, Hausa is spoken in the Northern region of Nigeria, which 
includes North-central, North-east and North-west zones. Yoruba is the dominant language 
spoken in the Western part of Nigeria, specifically the South-west zone. The Yoruba speaking 
group constituted the overwhelming majority in the west, making up over 80% of the total 
regional population, followed by Edo, with 7% in 1947 (Agheyisi 1984).  Igbo is the dominant 
language in the Eastern part of the country, especially in the South-eastern region. The Igbo 
people were the dominant ethnic group in the eastern region, making 50% of the total regional 
population in 1947 (Agheyisi 1984). These geographical locations can be seen in the map of 
Nigeria in Figure 1 above (p. 2).

1.1.3 Minor Ethnic Languages 
Apart from the national languages, other native languages are called minor languages, and are 
spoken by smaller ethnic groups in Nigeria. Many minor languages are also names of the ethnic 
groups, such as Ibibio, Anaang, Efik and others in the South, specifically the South-South zone. 
Others are Fulfulde, Kanuri, Bashar, spoken in the North, and Ese, Igasi, Arigidi among others, 
spoken in the West. They also include Eza, Legbo, Igala, and Oring, spoken in the East (Blench 
2012). Some minor languages are spoken in more than one region of the country. An example is 
Kukele, spoken in Anambara state (Eastern Nigeria), and Cross Rivers state (Southern Nigeria) 
(See Blench 2012 for the list of languages and where they are spoken in Nigeria). Minor 
languages are sometimes taught as subjects in schools in the ethnic society they are spoken 
(Ogunmodimu 2015) and are also first languages of some of its indigenes in the area. They are 
the languages used in traditional functions, local parliament and mostly the primary language of 
communication in the area the languages are spoken.  
Every State in Nigeria has a variety of language that is standard and widely spoken across 
local government areas in the state. It is always mutually intelligible within the state. For 
example, in Akwa Ibom state, there are 31 local government areas and 5 main languages spoken; 
Ibibio, Anaang, Ekid, Oro and Obolo. Ibibio has the largest number of speakers and is the 
language of the state capital, Uyo, spoken in 15 local government areas in the state and taught in 
primary/elementary schools in the whole state. Anaang is the second most dominant language in 
the state, spoken in 8 local government areas in the state. Other languages here are widely 
spoken in the state because their speakers can live anywhere in or outside the state. However, 
each local government has their own dominant/primary/indigenous language.

1.1.4 Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) 
Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) is a neutral basilectal variety of the English language spoken 
across every ethnic and social boundary in the nation. In a creole continuum, basilect is a variety 
furthest from the standard lexifier language (Singler 1991), in this case English. Although 
English is the official language, NPE has almost taken over the role of lingua franca in informal 
domains (Ogunmodimu 2015). Despite NPE being an informal lingua Franca, which transcends 
regional, ethnic and linguistic boundaries, it has no official status or recognition in Nigeria 
(Ogunmodimu 2015). In the highly multilingual states in Nigeria, which also lack widespread 
indigenous lingua francas, such as Rivers and Cross River (in the South-south region), NPE 
readily complements English to meet this important communication need in Nigeria (Agheyisi 
1984). More background on NPE is given in the following section (section 1.2). 
 
NPE, popularly referred to as ‘broken English’ or ‘bad English’ by most Nigerians, is 
spoken by more than thirty million Nigerians (Holms 1989) and forms a continuum with the 
West African Pidgin English that stretches from Sierra Leone to Gabon in Central Africa 
(Barbag-Stoll 1983). The language originated from intercultural interactions between Europeans 
and Africans from the 16th century to the 19th century. In recent records, Nigeria is estimated to 
have between three and five million people who primarily use NPE in their day-to-day 
interactions, but is said to be a second language to up to seventy-five million people in Nigeria 
alone, about half the population (BBC 2016). NPE has come to dominate urban spaces in 
Nigeria, and has widespread acceptance to the level of it being the first language of many 
Nigerians, especially in Edo state, in Warri, Port Harcourt and Sapele (Elugbe and Omamor 
1991).  

8 
 
Linguists over the years have proposed the adoption of NPE as the national language of 
Nigeria. One reason for this proposal is to use a Nigerian language as the official language in 
attempt to maintain an African identity (Agbali 2005, Ogunmodimu 2015). Choosing a single 
indigenous official language out of 500 possible languages is not an easy one to make, which 
may be why Nigeria still maintains English as its official language after independence 
(Ognmodimu 2015). Under such circumstances, NPE being a language that originated within 
Nigeria can be seen as indigenous to an extent, and may be promoted as a national language in 
the nation.  Another advantage of NPE is that its lexicon embodies a composite of diverse 
Nigerian linguistic heritages like Hausa and Yoruba (Agbali 2005). It also cuts across religious 
affiliation, and even Nigerians in the diaspora use NPE as a language that reflects their 
Nigerianess, a marker of identity and solidarity (Akande & Salami 2010).

Chapter 2: The Variable - plural marking in NPE 
Plural in NPE is marked in a number of ways. Faraclas (1989) argues that most nouns in NPE are 
assumed to be singular, except when indicated by morphosyntactic or pragmatic contextual cues, 
and bare nouns are given a generic reading. The (morpho-)syntactic means of signalling plural in 
NPE as identified in Tagliamonte et al. (1997) are the use of morphological plural -s, the 
postnominal plural dem, and prenominal determiners which include numerals and indefinite 
quantifiers. Double plural marking is further identified in the work of Ogunmodimu (2014) as 
another plural marking strategy, where more than one type of plural marking strategy is used in 
an NP. Reduplication of adjectives/nominals is another plural marking strategy in NPE.  NPs can 
also be null marked (zero marking) in NPE, where the plural reading is derived from context 
based on prior information (Ogunmodimu 2014). The following are examples of the use of these 
plural marking strategies above from my data. 
a. -s:   
The morphological plural affix -s has the same form of the -s plural marker in English which is 
suffixed to the noun in the NP. As seen in (1) below, -s is attached to the noun Nigerian to give it 
a plural reading.  
 
(1)   hia  dey  
expensiv      fo     os    Nigerian-s                         (06m2001) 
              Here  is  
expensive    for    us Nigerian- PLU 
   
   ‘here is expensive for us Nigerians’ 
 
b. Dem: 
The dem postnominal plural marker is considered as the main plural marker in NPE in older 
studies such as Faraclas (1989, p.352).  Mafeni (1971) claims that it is the only overt plural 
marker in NPE. This plural marker is common in other English lexified creoles, such as 

10 
 
Jamiekan and Gullah (Mufwene 1986), which will be discussed below. In (2), the dem plural 
marker which immediately follows the noun fren signifies or provides a plural reading to the 
noun in the sentence. 
 
(2) yu 
 no 
 ol 
 of  
mai 
 fren  dem                   (14f1970) 
you 
 know  all 
 of 
my 
friend PLU 
‘you know all of my friends’ 
 
c.    redup  
In NPE, nominals or adjectives can be reduplicated to mark plurals. The adjectives usually 
precede the noun. In (3), the reduplication of the noun ashawo shows that the same word 
signifies more than one prostitute, providing a plural reading to the NP. In example (4) below, 
the adjective fain is reduplicated to indicate plurality of the noun haus. This shows that it is more 
than one fine house that will be built.  
 
(3) ashawo-ashawo  
 na 
im  
yu  
no                        (20f1985) 
prostitute-prostitute  is 
what 
you 
know 
‘prostitutes are the people you know’ 
 
 
(4) im 
 go 
 go 
 biud  fain-fain  
haus              (20f1985) 
him 
 go 
 go 
 build  fine-fine 
house 
‘he will go and build fine houses’ 
 
 
d. zero marking  
Plural reading in this strategy of plural marking is derived from the context because there is an 
absence of overt plural marking and it relies on prior information to show the number of the 
noun in question. Zero marking (null marking) is also seen in older literature on NPE as one of 

11 
 
the ways plural is marked (Faraclas 1989). An example is seen below in (5) where the sentence, 
which is definite, does not have any overt plural marking on the noun lab, but the plural reading 
is derived from the context in the sentence. 
(5) an  
mai  
skul  
get  
ol  
di  
lab            (19f2000) 
and 
my 
school get 
all 
the 
lab 
 
           ‘and my school has all the labs’ 
 
e. double marking:  
Double marking here refers to a system of marking plurals in NPE where two or more plural 
marking strategies are used to signify plurality for a noun in an NP. In the examples (6) and (7) 
below, there is both the use of reduplication of adjectives strategy of plural marking preceding 
the noun, and the morphological plural -s used to signify plural, for the nouns gel and skul. Either 
of the strategies, the morphological plural -s or the reduplication of adjective in the example (6) 
and (7) could be used to indicate plural in the examples. 
 
(6) na  
dis  
yong-yong  
gel-s 
      (14f1970) 
it-is 
this 
young-young gel- PLU  
‘it is these young girls’ 
 
 
(7) top-top  
skul-s  
get              (03m2000) 
top-top 
school- PLU 
get 
 
‘top schools have-’ 
 
f. numerals and quantifiers  
Numerals are also used in NPE as a means of indicating plural. The example (8) below shows the 
use of a numeral in the NP sevun yes ‘seven years’ and the morphological plural suffix -s to mark 
plural.  

12 
 
 
(8) ai  
wok  fo  
dem 
fo  
sevun  ye-s   
bifo  
ai 
 kom  Canada 
I 
work for 
them for 
seven  year- PLU 
before I 
 come Canada 
‘I worked for them for seven years before I came to Canada’       (11m1974) 
 
Quantifiers are used to indicate plural in NPE which is also obtainable in English, the lexifier 
language. Example (9) shows the use of a non-numerical determiner or quantifier and zero 
marking on the noun in question, such that the plural reading is derived from the word meni 
‘many’ preceding the noun in the NP. 
 
(9) so 
meni  choch  no 
 bi 
 laik 
 hie             (18f1969) 
so 
many church 
 no 
be 
like 
here 
‘so many churches, not like here’ 
 
 
The use of the morphological plural -s, the use of numerals, quantifiers and the 
postnominal plural dem to signify plural can be found in other Creoles with English as their 
lexifier language. Examples for Gullah are given in (10) below. 
 
Gullah (adapted from Mufwene 1986, p.34) 
(10) 
a. [ hi sᴧn dᴇm/nᴇm]    ‘his sons’  
b. [hi sᴧnz] 
 
  ‘his sons’                    
             
c. [*hi sᴧnz dem/nem]  ‘his sons’   
 
The example above in (10a and 10b) shows the use of dem and the morphological plural -s to 
signal plural in Gullah. In (10a), dem is used to mark plural on sᴧn  and in (10b) -s is used to 
mark plural. In (10c), where the NP sᴧn is doubly marked with -s (z) and dem, the phrase is 

13 
 
ungrammatical. This would be grammatical in NPE, which is one difference between both 
languages. The example shows that both patterns (-s and dem) are used in the Gullah to mark 
plural.  
In Jamaican Creole, dem and quantifiers are also used to signify plural. In (11), dem is 
used as a postnominal plural marker to signal plurality and in (12) the quantifier som is used to 
signify plural in Jamaican Creole.

It is also worth noting that Jamaican Creole does not mark plural with -s, but with dem, 
numerals, quantifiers, and zero marking. Double marking is not used in Jamaican Creole either 
as seen below in (13) (Ghomeshi & Holness 2018).

As explained in Ghomeshi and Holness (2018, p. 6), in (13) above, the quantifier som and the 
numeral chrii are sufficient indicators of plurality, and it is ungrammatical to use dem with these 
elements.

2.1 Previous research  
There have been a number of previous studies on plural marking in NPE dating back to Mafeni 
(1971), and while much of this work has been done in Nigeria (Mafeni 1971, Deuber 2005, 
Faraclas (1997), Ogunmodimu 2014), some was also conducted on Nigerian ex-pats living in 
Canada (Tagliamonte et al 1997). In this section I will first give an overview of the more 
descriptive research on plural marking in NPE, then focus on two specifically variationist 
studies.  
 Faraclas (1989) analyzes the grammar of NPE based on transcribed interviews of 
Nigerians living in Porth Harcourt between 1985 – 1986. He explained that in NPE, most nouns 
are assumed to be singular except when indicated by pragmatic or morphosyntactic cues. 
Numerals, quantifiers, the postnominal plural dem and null marking were reported as the plural 
markers in his study. He however stated that dem and null marking (zero) are the most common 
plurals in NPE (p. 352). He mentioned that -s can be used as a plural indicator but referred to it 
as ‘borrowing’. Mafeni (1971) also identifies dem as the most common if not the only plural 
marker in NPE (p. 110).  Deuber (2005) is a more recent study that investigated the grammar of 
NPE speakers in Lagos, a metropolitan city in Nigeria. The author shows that though Lagosians 
use dem, it is very limited. Deuber also argues that the use of postnominal dem as a plural marker 
has disappeared from the speech of the average educated NPE speaker, and is restricted to formal 
radio broadcast as a conscious pidginization strategy (p. 119).  
Two other studies have provided variationist analyses of plural marking in NPE. I discuss 
them in more detail, as they are sociolinguistic analyses like my current study. In section 2.1.1 I 
first discuss Tagliamonte et al (1997), and in 2.1.2 I examine Ogunmodimu’s (2014). 
 

15 
 
2.1.1 Tagliamonte et al. (1997) 
Tagliamonte et al. (1997) is a variationist study of plural marking in NPE that looks at linguistic 
factors that may influence the choice of plural markers. The data collected for analysis was from 
12 NPE speakers (11 adults, 8 male and 3 female, 1 child (age 11)) residing in Ontario, all born 
and raised in NPE-predominant areas in Nigeria, (Bendel, Rivers, Lagos) who had immigrated to 
Canada between 1991 – 1996. Their ages ranged from 28 – 52 years and they were middle class 
educated adults (except the child). Their variable context was all individual nouns with plural 
reference whether being accompanied with overt plural marker or not. Their data were analyzed 
using Goldvarb to determine which effects were statistically significant and to what degree. In 
their data, the post nominal dem accounted for less than 1% of the data. The morphological 
plural -s on the other hand was dominant in their data. It was identified as the most frequently 
used plural marker, which is sensitive to animacy. Animate nouns favoured overt -s plural 
marking in their data and generic reference favoured zero marking.  ‘Definiteness’ was also not a 
distinguishing factor in their data and linguistic factors such as the preceding or following 
phonological segment were not significant factors in the choice of plural the speakers used.  
Tagliamonte at al. (1997) argue that knowledge of other languages may play a role in the 
choice of plural marking. For instance, zero-marking is a plural marking strategy in Igbo. 
Tagliamonte et al (1997) found that speakers of Igbo were more likely to use zero-marking as a 
plural strategy, which they attributed to the influence of a dominant Igbo grammar. They further 
noted that the more exposed to English a speaker is, the more likely it is that they will use the 
morphological plural -s, measured by the level of education the speakers had acquired.  No 
investigation of the use of the different plural markers in relation to the social factors age and 

16 
 
gender was done. They also did not look at the differences between their study and past literature 
concerning plural marking as a change that may be occurring in the language. 
 
2.1.2 Ogunmodimu (2014) 
Ogunmodimu (2014) is another sociolinguistic study that focuses on different plural marking 
features of Nigerian Pidgin English. In contrast with Tagliamonte et al (1997), Ogunmodimu 
(2014)’s data collection was carried out in Nigeria. The variants investigated were morphological 
plural -s, zero marking, numerals/quantifiers, dem and double-marking. The participants were 
native speakers of Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, and minor languages Urhobo and Edo. The 
independent variables investigated social factors ethnicity, education, and region of residence, 
and a linguistic factor animacy of antecedent.  Ogunmodimu (2014)’s results show that animate 
referents strongly favoured -s plural over inanimate referents. Speakers with higher education 
level strongly preferred the -s plural marker over others. The use of dem was highly disfavoured 
by those with higher levels of education. Speakers of Igbo, Urhobo and Edo, all have lexical 
plural markers in their native languages that function somewhat like dem and these speakers used 
dem more than speakers of Hausa, which does not have such a plural marker. Yoruba speakers, 
on the other hand, produced no dem even though they use third person plural pronoun to mark 
plural in Yoruba. For double marking, Speakers with university education used double marking 
more than those who only had high school education. The author noted that education is the 
major factor determining the use of -s suggesting it is as a result of contact with English. In this 
study there was an absence of significant differences of speaker’s gender, L1 or region of 
residence, which, according to the author, suggests a broad consistency of NPE. That is, both 
factors (L1 and region of residence) do not play a role in the choice of plural used by the 

17 
 
participants of his study. Language change, the main interest of my current study, was not 
investigated in Ogunmodimu (2014). The results from both studies are summarized below in 
Table 1.

2.2 Social variables (gender, age, dominant language) 
In this section I give some background on previous research underlying the social variables that 
will be investigated in this study, and possible predictions based on previous studies. Gender will 
be discussed in 2.2.1, age in 2.2.2 and dominant language in 2.2.3. 
 

18 
 
2.2.1 Gender 
The gender of a speaker has been found to be one of the most important social factors predicting 
sociolinguistic differences. Eckert (1989) defines sex as a biological category that serves as a 
fundamental basis for the differentiation of roles, norms, and expectations in all society. These 
roles, norms and expectations constitute gender, the social construction of sex (p. 246). Work 
investigating speaker gender goes back to foundational studies in the field such as Labov (1966) 
and Trudgill (1972), which have shown that gender is a predictor of linguistic differences. Based 
on past studies such as Wolfram (1969) and Labov (1966), Trudgill (1972) explains that women 
produce linguistic forms that closely approach that of the standard language or have higher 
prestige than those produced by men, (Trudgill, 1972, p.180) which could be the case in NPE.  
Trudgill’s (1972) sociolinguistic study of British English has a striking feature in common with 
Labov’s (1966) study of American English that investigated the same variable -ing, that is the 
variable production of -ing as either ‘ing’ or ‘in’ in English words like singing. Trudgill 
investigated this variable in Norwich English, to determine if the pattern correlated with the one 
observed in Labov (1966). His results showed that males used a higher percentage of non-
standard [in] forms than females in British English, the same result obtained for American 
English. His results suggested that working-class non-standard speech is more highly valued and 
prestigious for the male speakers, which he calls covert prestige. This was reinforced not only by 
usage, but by the fact that male participants under-reported their use of the standard or prestige 
form while the women over-reported theirs. He therefore argued that women and men respond to 
different norms; men to covert vernacular prestige norms and women to overt, standard-
language, prestige norms. The same result is obtained in Kristian (2018) study that investigated 

19 
 
the same variable -ing. Her result showed that gender was significant with male speakers 
favouring the non-standard [in] than their female counterparts. 
Women, and especially urban young women, are often found to be leaders of language 
change in progress. An example is seen in Eckert’s (1989) study of data on phonological 
variation among Detroit’s suburban adolescents. The study showed a complex interaction 
between gender, social category, and urban-suburban orientation.  The speakers in this area 
participated in northern cities chain shift, a pattern of vowel shifting that affects the fronting of 
low vowels and the backing and lowering of high vowels. Older changes in the shift were the 
fronting of (ae) and (a) and the lowering and fronting of (oh). The newer ones were the backing 
of (e) and (uh) (p.260). In her findings, social category differences (jocks and burnouts) showed 
significant differences only in the newer changes, while only gender showed significant 
differences in the older changes. That is, for gender, girls were leading in the oldest changes in 
the northern cities chain shifts. They led by far in the raising of (ae) and fronting of (a). Their 
results showed females mostly leading the males in sound changes. 
Since Trudgill (1972) and other sociolinguistics studies (Wolfram 1969, Kristian 2018) 
have shown that women tend to use the prestigious forms more than the men, and Eckert (1989) 
has shown that women are often leaders of language change in progress, it is clear that gender is 
an important factor in sociolinguistic variation. Analysing gender effect in this study is important 
because it has not been well investigated in previous sociolinguistic studies of plural marking in 
NPE. By looking at gender, I intend to see whether women will use more of the variant (-s) that 
has the prestige of the superstrate- English. The morphological plural -s may be seen to have 
more prestige than the other plurals investigated in this study because it has the form of -s plural 
marker found in English.  Since the results from older studies suggest that men preferred non-

20 
 
standard speech (Trudgill 1972), I also intend to see if males will use more of the less 
prestigious/non-standard plural markers in NPE (postnominal dem/zero marking). I want to 
understand if there is a change from one form of plural marking to another and whether the 
women will be the leaders of the change as seen in previous sociolinguistics studies.  
 
2.2.2 Age and Language Change 
Age is another important factor in sociolinguistic studies that will be investigated in my research. 
Change occurs in language such that there could be a change from the use of one form or feature 
(X) in a language to another (Y). There is always a period in which both features (X and Y) co-
exist, then Y becomes more preferred than X while X dies gradually. This is the concept of 
language change in progress (Walker 2010, p. 94). A gradually increasing or decreasing 
frequency in the use of linguistic features viewed according to speaker age can be interpreted as 
change in progress, which is the apparent time hypothesis, used to investigate change in progress 
(Tagliamonte 2011). Apparent time is the study of a language at one point in time by examining 
the distribution of variation by age groups like the older and younger generation of speakers. If 
for instance the younger age group uses a particular form of a feature of language (for example, 
the form -s of the plural marking in NPE) significantly more than the older age group, it could be 
interpreted as change in progress. Therefore, apparent time is a method used to investigate 
language change in progress (Chambers 2002).  
The concept of apparent time is one of the foundational principles in Labov’s early work 
and variationist sociolinguistics. Labov carried out sociolinguistics interviews with the residents 
of Martha’s Vineyard in 1961 to study (ay) and (aw) diphthongs. In his analysis, he calculated an 
index value for the height of the vowel nucleus for each speaker for each diphthong. The results 

21 
 
showed that the nuclei of both diphthongs were progressively higher with each younger age 
cohort. The interpretation was that the older speakers have learned the language at the time 
where the speech community as a whole had lower values for height of the diphthongs. So, the 
older speakers’ speech reflected the state of the language at that earlier date. Labov referred to 
this interpretation as ‘apparent time’ (Labov 1963). The regular increase across the four 
generations investigated represents a generational change in progress with younger speakers 
leading the change. 
As discussed in section 2, older studies give dem and null marking as the primary plurals 
(Faraclas 1989) while newer studies show -s as the primary plural used in NPE (Tagliamonte 
1997, Ogunmodimu 2014). The difference between Faraclas and Ogunmodimu’s studies (both 
are conducted in Nigeria) suggests a change in the way plurals are marked in both time points 
(1985 and 2011- when both studies were conducted), with the former reporting dem and zero 
marking as the major plurals in NPE and the later reporting majority of -s in NPE. Tagliamonte 
et al’s (1997) study also reported a majority of -s plural in their data, at a similar rate as 
Ogunmodimu’s (2014) study (59% for both studies). One way to investigate this change is 
through an apparent time study, where the speech of different generations is examined. I may be 
able to infer from comparisons of two or three generations that any differences may be attributed 
to linguistic change in progress. According to Boberg’s (2004) explanation of apparent time 
change, people do not significantly alter the way they speak over their adult lifetimes such that 
each generation of speakers reflects the state of the language which they acquired as a child. 
Rather, these differences reflect the passage of time, inferred through the comparison of different 
generations (p. 250 – 251).   

22 
 
 
Another example of language change being investigated in apparent time is the study of 
Tagliamonte and D’Arcy (2009). They set out to investigate the mechanism by which a linguistic 
change advances across successive generation of speakers.  They looked at ongoing 
morphosyntactic and discourse-pragmatic changes. The discourse-pragmatic variables they 
looked at were like, be like, so, have to, have, going to. For some of the variables, example be 
like, the tests they conducted revealed the highest possible level of significance, demonstrating a 
strong and significant negative correlation between the use of be like and age (p. 92). This is also 
the case for the other variables all led by adolescents and women except the modal have to. Their 
results showed that a considerable amount of the variation can be explained by age, and that 
changes that are vigorous are most likely to percolate through the youngest members of a 
population. They stated that these changes mark transitions from preadolescence, to adolescence 
to young adulthood, and that last stage is stabilization of the grammar. Generally, the changes 
progress with a peak during adolescence as seen in the use of these variables investigated. This is 
therefore a motivation to look at different generations in my study. If the younger speakers in my 
study use -s more and less or no dem, and vice-versa the case for the older speakers, then it could 
be interpreted as change in apparent time.  
 
Age can tell us different things in sociolinguistic analysis. Since there are older studies 
that show that dem and null marking (zero marking) are the dominant plural markers (Faraclas 
1989 and Mafeni 1971) and newer ones that show that -s is dominant (Tagliamonte et al. 1997 
and Ogunmodimu 2014), I want to look at to see whether or not these differences reflect a 
change in progress, and what factors play a role in this change. 
 
 

23 
 
2.2.3 Dominant Language 
Since Nigerians are mostly multilinguals, the languages they speak could have an impact on their 
use of NPE.  If the dominant language of an NPE speaker is Yoruba, for instance, the speaker 
may tend to use features in NPE that are similar to that of Yoruba when speaking NPE. This 
makes the variable dominant language an important one when investigating variation in NPE. 
We saw that previous researchers include some of these languages as a variables in their studies 
(Ogunmodimu 2014, Tagliamonte 1997). 
There are many studies showing that one language can have an effect on another within 
the speech of a bilingual or multilingual speaker. For example, Kootra and Doedens (2016) 
conducted a bilingual study which focused on cross-language interactions from different sources 
of experience in the production of dative sentences by Dutch-dominant and Dutch–English 
bilinguals. They show that representations from the dominant/more proficient language are easier 
to activate and more difficult to deactivate than representations from the non-dominant/less 
proficient language. This results in a relatively strong influence of the dominant language on 
processing in the nondominant language compared to the other way around. They predict that all 
cross-language effects could be influenced by language dominance in the sense that cross-
language effects are generally more likely to occur from the dominant to the non-dominant 
language than vice versa. 
In their overall findings, the influence of the dominant language (Dutch) on the non-
dominant language (English) was stronger than the other way around (p. 725). Their study shows 
that the factor of a dominant language could play a role in the grammar of bilinguals for the 
languages they speak. Since the participants of this study are multilinguals, I intend to look at 

24 
 
dominant language as an independent variable in this study to see if the speakers will use plural 
variants in NPE that resembles the ones that are used in their dominant language and vice-versa.  
Also, in my study, the majority of the participants are Yoruba speakers, which is a 
different West African language from Igbo, the native language of majority of the participants in 
Tagliamonte et al.’s (1997) study. Since the authors suggested that substratum influence from 
Igbo may have been the reason for the high rate of zero marking, it will be interesting to see if it 
is the case among Yoruba speakers and participants in my study in general. In Yoruba, there is a 
plural marking strategy that is similar to postnominal plural dem in NPE. For participants whose 
dominant language is English, it would be expected that they would use more of the plural 
marker -s. For NPE dominant language speakers, dem may be the plural they may use more since 
it is a creole/pidgin plural marker.  
 
2.3 Linguistic variables  
Animacy, type of nominal reference, and determiner type are the three linguistic variables 
investigated in this study, which will be further discussed in section 3.2. The primary reason for 
these being investigated is that they were used as linguistic variables in Tagliamonte et al (1997), 
where both determiner type and animacy were found to be significant. The present study will 
attempt to replicate Tagliamonte et al (1997)’s study. In their study, animate nouns favoured 
overt -s plural marking in their data and nouns with generic reference favoured zero marking. 
Determiner type was also found to be significant in their data. Possessives, definite articles and 
bare nouns (no determiners) favour zero marking while nouns with demonstratives, numeric and 
non-numeric determiners favour -s. Their result countered the received wisdom about creoles 
that a mark should be favoured in contexts where plurality is not otherwise disambiguated in the 

25 
 
NP headed by the noun in question (Todd 1974, Tagliamonte et al 1997). It was expected that 
nouns with possessive, definite articles and bare nouns would be marked with -s, and nouns with 
demonstratives, numeric and non-numeric determiners would favour null marks. This was not 
the case. I intend to find out if the same pattern will occur in my research or as is expected in 
creoles. My study is conducted twenty years after Tagliamonte’s work, and my participants are 
of a similar demographic, that is, they are all Nigerians living in Canada. This study may help 
show whether there is a change in the way NPE speakers today use plural markers in NPE than it 
was used twenty years ago. 
 
2.4 Research questions 
One of the variants, plural marker (dem) is said to be extremely rare, accountable for less than 
1% of the data in Tagliamonte et al (1997). This is surprising since dem was one of the most 
frequently used plural signals in NPE nouns in older studies such as Faraclas (1989) and Mafeni 
(1971). Also, as a native speaker who uses dem as a plural marker, I am particularly curious 
about its disappearance. I will be investigating the variation between dem, zero marking, -s, and 
reduplication of nouns/adjectives as the plural markers in NPE. This may help answer the 
following questions: 
- 
Is one variant the older variant and the other new, i.e. is there a change in progress from 
the use of one form over the other?  
- 
Are other social factors such as age, gender or dominant language playing a role in this 
variation? If the variation is in fact change in progress, who are the leaders of this 
change?  

26 
 
- 
Do linguistic factors such as animacy, nominal reference and determiner type affect the 
choice of the plural marker used in NPE? 
These factors have been discussed in section (2.2) and (2.3) above. I now move on to section (3) 
where I outline the methods used to collect and analyze the data to answer the above research 
questions.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

27 
 
Chapter 3: Methodology 
In section 3.1. I discuss the data collection, in 3.2 I describe how I analyze the data, and in 3.3 I 
discuss the statistical analysis of the data. 
 
3.1 Data Collection 
The data used for this study was collected from 20 NPE speakers who were living in Winnipeg, 
Manitoba at the time of the interviews in the fall of 2019. The participants were recruited 
through the snowballing method, such that friends and family of the researcher informed their 
own friends that fit the requirements of participants for the study, to participate in the study if 
they are interested. Some interviews, especially those of the younger speakers, were mostly 
University of Manitoba undergraduate students, were conducted in the sociolinguistics lab of the 
University of Manitoba. The older speakers were interviewed in their own homes or in quiet 
places of their choosing, like libraries and churches in Winnipeg. In the sociolinguistic 
interviews, I talked to the participants between 45 minutes to 1 hour, asking questions that would 
rouse a story. The questions asked in the interview focused on informal topics such as school 
activities, hobbies, sports, TV shows, friends, family, and as suggested in Tagliamonte (2011 
p.104), discussions about problems with their parents (like who is more strict), boyfriends and 
girlfriends, etc. (p. 104). The participants were not obligated to answer any question they were 
not comfortable answering, even though such situations did not occur. The recording device used 
for the interviews was the Zoom H4N Handy recorder. Sanken COS-11D Miniature 
Omnidirectional Lavalier Microphones were used as external microphones. These were attached 
to the participants’ clothing during the recording to help capture a high quality and volume of the 

28 
 
participant’s voice. The recorder accepts up to 32GB SD card, which was inserted into the 
recorder before every interview to store the recorded interviews.  
 
3.1.1 Subjects  
Twenty participants took part in the study. Two age categories were targeted: over 50 years old 
(born between 1963 - 1970), and between 18-35 years old (born between 1985- 2001).  Due to 
difficulties in recruiting older speakers, however, because of full-time jobs and other 
commitments, one 46-year-old male and one 49-year-old female were interviewed as part of the 
older cohort. Ten younger speakers (5 males and 5 females) of the ages 18 – 35 took part in the 
study.  Nine were of ages 18-24 and one female speaker was 34 years as of when the interviews 
were conducted. The distribution of speakers age and gender is seen below in table 2 below (p. 
28). The older speakers are all highly educated in Nigerian universities in fields such as 
accounting, education, healthcare etc. They have all lived in Canada for about 5-10 years. The 
younger speakers were mostly first year university undergraduates who came to Canada to 
acquire post-secondary education, a graduate student and a 34-year-old businesswoman. The 
level of education of the participants is therefore controlled for, since they all have or are 
acquiring post-secondary education.  The younger speakers have all lived in Canada for 1-5 
years. All the speakers (except the 1 speaker that was born in the UK) were born and raised in 
Nigeria, in areas where NPE is spoken, such as in Lagos, Edo, Port Harcourt etc. They had all 
live in Nigeria most of their lives, long enough to acquire and communicate fluently in NPE.

All the speakers are multilinguals with fluency in English, one major or minor language, and 
NPE. The major languages speakers spoke were Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, and the minor 
language some spoke was Ẹ̀ dó/Bini. However, Yoruba is spoken by majority of the participants 
in the study. The dominant languages of the speakers which were self-reported were Yoruba 
(10), NPE (5), English (4) and Hausa (1). The lack of even distribution reflects the fact that 
dominant language was not originally a factor of interest for this study. The distribution of 
speakers by dominant language is seen in Table 3 below.

3.2 Analysis 
Each interview recording was coded in Elan transcribing software (Nagy & Meyerhoff 2015). 
The transcriptions were focused on sentences where plural NPs were used. In the sections that 
follow, coding (3.2.1) and exceptional distributions (3.2.2) will be discussed. 
 
3.2.1 Coding 
Elan is the software used to transcribe and code the data for this study (Sloetjes, & Wittenburg 
2008). Elan is primarily a transcribing tool, which may also be used for extracting and coding 
tokens of linguistic variables for quantitative analysis (Nagy & Meyerhoff 2015,  p. 5). After 
recording the interviews of my study and importing it into Elan, I created tiers in which to 
transcribe the interview and code each variable, and then listened for all instances of plural 
readings. Whenever there was one, I transcribed the sentence and coded for each variable, adding 
the appropriate level in each tier. With Elan, all the variables investigated in each speaker’s 
interview are coded for in the file and could be useful for future research. See Nagy and 
Meyerhoff (2015) for a detailed description of how Elan can be used for coding. An example can 
be seen in figure 2 below. 
The tiers were organized as follows: 
- 
Speaker (labeled using a speaker code e.g. 01f2000, ‘f’ indicating gender ‘female’ and 
2000 the year of birth of the participant) 
- 
Interviewer 
- 
PLURAL (-s, dem, zero, redup) 
- 
Animacy (hum, ani, inani): human, animate and inanimate 
- 
Noun 

31 
 
- 
Type of nominal reference (def, indef, gen): Definite, indefinite and generic noun 
- 
Type of determiner (poss, num, non-num, def, no, dem): Possessive, numeric, non-
numeric, definite, no determiner and demonstrative determiner. 
- 
Double or single (doub, sing) 
- 
Second plural marker – this tier was only populated when a noun had two plural 
markers used in a noun phrase or sentence to signal plurality (double marking).  
 
 Figure 2 - Example of ELAN transcription and coding  
 
 
Figure 2 above shows the organization of tiers used to code the data for this study.  
After coding the variables, I exported transcription annotations, token codes and 
timestamps (which were later removed) to create a tab-delimited text file to use as input into 

32 
 
Excel and into the statistical analysis program, Rstudio. Examples of the data coded for the 
linguistic variables (animacy, type of nominal reference, type of determiner) are provided next. 
 
3.2.1.1 Animacy 
In this section, I look at examples of the linguistic variable animacy. Nouns were coded for 
human (hum), animate (ani) and inanimate (inan). To see if there were differences in the choice 
of plural between human and non-human nouns animate nouns, human nouns were coded as hum 
while non-human nouns were coded as ani. In (14) below, the noun kosins is human, in (15) the 
noun flais is animate and in (16) the noun festivals is inanimate. The three nouns are marked with 
the morphological plural -s.

                   ‘my father’s cousins are around us’

                  ‘there are some festivals that are happening’  
 
 
3.2.1.2 Type of Nominal Reference 
In this section I give examples of data according to the reference of the noun, that is, definite, 
indefinite and generic NPs. Definite NPs are specific particular individualized NPs where 

33 
 
reference is assumed to be clear to the hearer, while for indefinite NP, the speaker may be aware 
of what is being referred to while the hearer may not (Lyons 1999, p.2-3).  A generic noun 
phrase is a noun phrase that does not refer to a specific (set of) individual(s) but rather to a kind 
or class of individuals (Reiter & Frank 2010).   
(17)

                  ‘our judges will not speak’ 
  
(18)

waif-s                               (indef- 02f2001)               
            then 
their 
father marry two 
wife- PLU               
            ‘then their father married two wives’  
 
 
(19) 
yu  
sabi  
di     we      Nigerian -s  
de    du   am          (gen - 03m2000) 
            you 
know the   way    Nigerian- PLU            are   do   it 
            ‘you know the way Nigerians do it’      
  
 
In the example (17) above, the reference of the noun joj is definite because of the possessive 
determiner awa, since possessive NPs are interpreted as definite (Lyons 1999). In (18) the hearer 
does not have knowledge of which tu waifs are being referred, therefore it is indefinite. The noun 
Nigerians in (19) is generic, referring to all Nigerians. 
 
3.2.1.3 Type of Determiner 
This section provides data showing the different types of determiner of the noun. It includes 
possessive, no determiner, demonstrative, definite, non-numeric and numeric determiners. 
Demonstratives in NPE show number distinction and they include; dis – ‘this/these’ dat – ‘that’ 
and dos – ‘those’. They are loan words from English (Mowarin 2013). For dis, the number 

34 
 
distinction can be determined from context for zero marking, or by any overt plural marking used 
in the NP.  
The noun joj in example (20) has the possessive determiner awa and the plural reading of 
the noun is determined from context (zero marking). For example (21), the noun kwestions does 
not have any determiner. dos barias in (22) has the plural demonstrative determiner preceding 
the noun barias. Plenti is the non-numeric determiner used in (23) as the determiner preceding 
gehs. In (24), the number tu is used as a numeric determiner preceding boi. The morphological 
plural -s marks plural in examples (20-24).  In example (25) above, the plural reading is derived 
from context (zero marking) the noun has a definite determiner di that precedes the noun indigin.

3.2.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
A total of 811 tokens of plural nouns were retained for quantitative analysis. Four main types of 
examples were not included in the analyzed data. They are; a) situations where plural is 
ambiguous, b) where there is ambiguity over whether the plural is English or NPE, c) 
unintelligible recordings and d) phonological ambiguity.  
 
3.2.2.1 Ambiguous plural 
Expressions with zero marking that are not clear from context whether they are singular, or 
plural were excluded, as in (26).   
 
 
(26) 
wi 
no 
get 
hostel wey 
di 
skul 
biud  
            we 
no 
get 
hostel that 
the 
school build 
                        ‘we don’t have a hostel/hostels built by the school’                (14f1970) 
 
 
In (26), the word hostel does not have an overt plural marker and from the context, it could be 
singular or plural. Occurrences like this were not counted. 
 
3.2.2.2 English or NPE 
Examples of data that were not counted because it was uncertain whether the plural was English 
or NPE are seen below in (27-28); 
 
(27) 
afta 
choch bois 
briged  
 
 
(12m1963) 
after 
church boys 
brigade  
‘after church we attend boys brigade’ 

36 
 
 
(28) 
Bambam 
bi 
teti 
 ye-s 
  
old  
 
(02f2001) 
Bambam 
is 
thirty year- PLU 
old 
‘Bambam is thirty years old’ 
 
 
In example (27) and (28), the nominal expressions bois briged and teti yes old are the same as 
English expressions. Example (28) was not counted as plural marking in NPE since it could be 
that the speaker code-switched and used an English expression in these contexts. Ordinarily 
‘boys brigade’ is a name of a voluntary organization. There is no NPE expression for the name of 
this organization other than the English one, and so expressions such as these were not counted 
as -s in NPE in the data. Similarly, ‘thirty years old’ is a common way to tell someone’s age in 
English. In NPE, the last word old is usually left out, to have the expression teti yes. This is why 
the NP yes in teti yes old was not counted as morphological plural -s in the my data. Tagliamonte 
et al describe these as frozen expressions that show no variability in marker usage, remaining 
categorically bare or categorically marked (1997:108). 
 
3.2.2.3 Phonological Ambiguity 
In this section, examples are provided for data that were not counted due to phonological 
ambiguity as seen below in (29-30). 
 
(29) 
somtaims 
klot-(s)      somtaims  
mit 
 
(02f2001) 
sometimes 
cloth-(PLU) sometimes 
meat 
‘sometimes cloth(es) sometimes meat’ 
 
 
In example (29) above, the noun klot is immediately followed by the adverb somtaims, that 
begins with a sibilant phoneme /s/. Because of the neutralization context, it is not certain whether 

37 
 
the noun is plural klots or singular klot and the -s being a result of the following /s/ sound from 
the word somtaims. Therefore, this token and others like it was not included. 
 
3.2.2.4 Unintelligible Recording 
The example (30) shows an instance where the recording was unintelligible. 
(30) 
ron 
 ha 
 strit-(s) 
 
 
 
 
(01f2001) 
run 
 her 
 street-(PLU) 
‘do something bad to her’ 
 
 
In (30) it was difficult to hear from the recording if the noun was strit or strits, and so the 
example was not included for analysis.   
 
3.2.2.5 Other coding considerations 
In NPE and some other creoles like Jamiekan, dem can be used to produce an associative 
meaning. The use of dem as an associative plural refers to a ranked group of people with the 
focal member identified, and the associates (usually family or close friends) implied (Ghomeshi 
and Holness 2018). An example is seen in (31) below; 
 
(31) 
Jon  
dem  tu  
de  
fain  
trouble 
                  John -ass-    too  
is  
find 
trouble 
                  ‘John (and friends/associates) are troublesome’ 
In (31) it is John and either his family members or friends that are troublesome, as opposed to 
more than one John. Examples of such, however, did not occur in my data. 
 
For consistency, I counted the first plural marker in the examples with double marking. 
Although they did not end up making up much of the data (<4%), this was done to enable the 
double marking to be looked at separately if need be.  

38 
 
 
Mass nouns were also not included in the data as provided in example (32) below where sofa 
‘suffer’ is a non-count noun reduplicated, but not coded as plural in my data. 
 
(32) 
Sofa-sofa 
 tu 
 moch  fo 
 Lagos                          (03m2000) 
Suffer-suffer  too 
 much  for 
 Lagos 
‘there are excessive sufferings in Lagos’ 
 
 
3.3 Statistical Analysis 
R is the statistical programming environment used for determining statistical significance of the 
independent variables in the use of plurals as summarized above.  After coding in Elan software, 
the transcribed files were opened as Excel spreadsheets and were categorized based on the 
independent and dependent variables. These Excel spreadsheets were then converted back to a 
tab-delimited text format and inputted into RStudio for summary statistics and to determine 
which variables are statistically significant and to what degree. This is achieved by running 
statistical models such as the generalized linear mixed model, or glmer. Within the model, I am 
using random and fixed effects to determine the choice of plural marker used by the speakers 
from all the variables investigated. speaker and noun as random effects was fit to the dataset in 
the R model (McCulloch & Neuhaus 2014). Fixed effects in the model were a two-way 
interaction between age category and gender, all social factors (age, gender and dominant 
language) and the linguistic factors (animacy, type of nominal reference and type of determiner). 
R is a programing language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics, 
while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R which is a good analytical 
software for quantitative data such as the one used in this study.

Chapter 4: Findings 
In this section I look at distributional analysis of my data. Overall distribution is given in 4.1 and 
the distribution of plurals by variable is given in 4.2. 
 
4.1 Overall Distribution 
Table 4 shows that -s is the dominant plural marker used in the data 80% of the time over all 
other plural markers. Zero marking is used 17% of the time, reduplication 1.5% of the time, 
while the postnominal plural dem is used about 1% of the time. Recall that the dem plural marker 
was also found in Tagliamonte et al (1997) to be less than 1% of their entire dataset, with -s and 
zero marking as the dominant plural markers (59% and 39%) respectively.

4.2 Distribution by Variable 
As outlined in section 3, the variables used in this study are divided into linguistic variables and 
social variables. The social variables are age, gender and dominant language. The linguistic 

40 
 
variables are animacy, type of nominal reference and type of determiner. In this section I will 
examine the distribution of plural marking according to each of these variables.  
 
4.2.1 Social variables  
Age 
Although -s is overall the most frequently-used variant, the rates of usage of each variant 
between different ages differs As seen in Figure 3, the younger speakers use the morphological 
plural -s 90% of the time, while the older speakers use it 60% of the time. For reduplication, the 
younger speakers use it about 2% and the older speakers use it less than 1% of the total tokens 
counted. zero marking is more common among the older speakers (35%) than among the 
younger speakers (7%). The distribution shows that -s is rising in use among the younger 
speakers and it seems to be replacing zero and dem as plural markers. While dem is not used 
much overall, it is especially worth noting that it is absent in younger speakers’ speech. Table 5 
shows the percentages and tokens for age.

Recall that one speaker in the younger group is somewhat of an outlier within that 
group, with a birth year of 1985 while the others had birthyears of 1994-2001.  Because of this 

42 
 
difference, the individual distribution of this speaker in comparison with the other ‘younger’ 
counterparts’ is given in Table 6.  This speaker produced 39 tokens, dominated by the 
morphological plural -s. There was no use of the postnominal plural dem. This speaker seems to 
pattern at a rate in between that of the older and the younger speakers, at least for -s and zero 
marking, as seen in table 6. This could be because the speaker is somewhat older, a business 
owner, and at a different point of her life than the others in her group, who are all university 
students. I will analyse the younger speaker’s data with and without her data to see if it will 
effect a change in the statistical outcome.

Gender 
An equal number of male and female speakers were interviewed to obtain a sample balanced for 
gender. Figure 4 below breaks down the distribution of the plural marking pattern across male 
and female speakers. The female speakers used somewhat more -s (83%) than the male speakers 

43 
 
(79%). The male speakers used zero marking (20%) more than the female speakers (13%). The 
data suggests that there is slightly less -s among men and they make up for it with the zero 
marking.

Dominant language: 
The dominant language of the speakers were Yoruba (10), NPE (5), English (4) and Hausa (1). 
Given that the morphological plural -s is the dominant plural used in the data, it is expected that 
it would be the highest percentage for each variant. Participants that have English as their 
dominant language as seen in Figure 5 below, use more -s (91%) than zero marking (6%) and 
reduplication (3%). They did not use any post nominal plural dem. The Yoruba speakers used -s 
85% of the time while zero marking was used approximately 14%. Both reduplication and dem 
were used less than 1% in their data. For the NPE speakers -s is the dominant plural used 76%, 
zero marking 20%, reduplication of adjectives/nouns (2.5%) and dem is used 1.5% of the total 
plurals used. The Hausa speaker used the morphological plural -s 55%, zero marking 43% and 
dem less than 2% in his data and this is a marked difference.

Figure 5 shows that the lower the use of the morphological plural -s, the higher the use of 
zero marking. English language dominant speakers appear to use the morphological plural -s 
more than the other speakers. This might be expected, given the fact that -s is a plural marker in 
English language. It is also evident that the English speakers did not use the postnominal dem in 
their data, which is not found in their dominant language English.  
 
It is pertinent to look at the nature of plural marking in these languages to determine if 
they are similar to the ones most used in their NPE. If there are similarities between the way 
plural is marked in these languages and in NPE, it could help explain how the dominant language 
plays a role in the choice of plural used by the speakers.   
 
Yoruba speakers have a 3rd person plural pronoun that is used as plural marker in Yoruba, 
but unlike the one found in NPE, it precedes the noun. Yoruba also includes reduplication of 
adjectives and zero marking strategies for plural marking (Ogunmodimu 2014). All these 
strategies can be seen below in (32-34); 
 
(33) 
 3rd person plural pronoun as number marker 
Àwon        olukó        yin     òga     ilé ìwe 
3rd-pl pro. teacher   praise  head  house-book 
‘The teachers praised the principal of the school.’ 
 
(34) 
Reduplication of adjective 
 
Ile  
nla nla   po     ni  ilu    eko 
house big big   many in  town Lagos 
‘There are big houses in Lagos.’ 
 
 
 
(35) 
Zero marking 
 

47 
 
Kole  ri     aja     ninu    igbo 
Kole    see   dog   inside  bush 
‘Kole saw a dog inside the bush.’  or 
 ‘Kole saw dogs inside the bush.’                  (Ogunmodimu 2014 p. 10) 
 
 
 
In (32) above, a 3rd person plural pronoun Àwon is used to provide a plural reading for the noun 
olukó. There is also the use of a reduplicated adjective nla nla to also signify plural in (33), 
although it follows the noun it pluralizes, while in NPE, reduplication always precedes the noun. 
In (34), depending on the context of the conversation, the noun aja ‘dog’ could be plural or 
singular. If it is plural, then zero marking strategy is used. In the data of this study, Yoruba 
speakers used all the strategies in NPE, but used the morphological plural -s more that these, 
which is not similar to any plural marking strategy in Yoruba. From this distribution, not much 
can be said for the influence of the dominant language (Yoruba) in the choice of plural marker 
used by its dominant speakers in NPE. 
 
Hausa, though an African language, belongs to West Chadic branch of the Afroasiatic 
Language family (Blench 2011).  In Hausa, which is the most widely spoken language in 
Northern Nigeria, plural is marked by nominal inflection and nominal reduplication as seen 
below in (35-36);

As seen in (35), the noun can be inflected upon to mark plural, and in (36) the noun is 
reduplicated to provide a plural reading. The only Hausa speaker in this study tended to use a lot 
of zero marking (43%), even though there is no zero marking strategy of plural marking in Hausa 
(Ogunmodimu 2014). But since there was only one participant in this category, no generalization 
can be made, because the differences could be attributable to an idiolectal style of speech to the 
participant.  
 
Apart from the Hausa speaker, NPE dominant language speakers used somewhat higher 
rates of zero plural marking than the other participants. It was expected that they would use post-
nominal dem more than other speakers because dem is a plural marker in NPE. Although they 
may have, this is speculation, due to the small quantity of dem used in the data overall. 
 
The findings show that English language dominant speakers use -s more than the other 
speakers in the other groups. Furthermore, Yoruba, NPE and Hausa speakers use zero marking 
more than the English speakers. The statistical analysis will show whether any of these 
differences are statistically meaningful.  
 
4.2.1.1 Linguistic Variables 
Animacy:  
Nouns with plural reading were divided into human, animate and inanimate nouns, since 
animacy was significant in the study of Tagliamonte et al (1997). Animate NPs included only 

49 
 
non-human animate nouns. The distribution of plural marking by animacy of the noun, that is, 
human, animate and inanimate nouns is seen in Figure 6 below. The speakers marked plural for 
human nouns with the morphological plural -s 81% of the time, zero marking 16%, and dem 1%. 
For animate nouns, -s was categorical, as seen below in figure 6, but given the low number of 
tokens in this category (n =5), animate and human nouns will be merged together, as 5 tokens is 
not enough to analyze quantitatively. Since human is a subset of animate, human and animate 
nouns with plurals are merged together to become animate (as earlier stated in section 2.3) 
bringing the total percentage of -s to about 82% as seen in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 6 - Animacy (human, animate and inanimate) 
 

50 
 
Figure 7 - Animacy (animate and inanimate) 
 
 
As seen in figure 7, -s is the dominant plural used for inanimate nouns that occurred 78% of the 
time, while zero marking occurred 18% of the time. dem plural is the least favoured plural that 
occurred 1% of the time for animate and 0.3% for inanimate nouns. To further clarify, see table 9

Type of nominal reference: 
Here, I look at the distribution of plural markers based on the reference of the NP. This includes 
definite, indefinite and generic referent nouns as seen in figure 8 below. Definite nouns vary 
between -s and zero marking, where -s is the dominant plural used 76% of the time and zero 
marking 22%. There is little to no occurrence of dem and reduplication for definite nouns. 
Indefinite nouns use between -s, zero, reduplication and dem, but favour -s (84%) more than zero 
(12%). Reduplication and dem are the least favoured plurals. For generic referenced plural, there 
is a choice between -s, zero, reduplication and dem. But -s is the most preferred plural (82%), 
followed by zero marking (12%). reduplication and dem are the least favoured plurals with an 
occurrence of about 2% and less than 1% respectively.  Table 10 below shows the distribution of 
plural tokens by nominal reference.

Type of determiner: 
The distribution of plurals by the type of determiner of the noun is shown in Figure 9 below; 
Figure 9 - Type of determiner 
 
 

53 
 
Nouns with possessive determiner use -s 79% of the time in the data. Zero marking occurred 
19% and variant dem occurred 1% of the time. Redup did not occur in this category. Nouns with 
demonstrative determiners alternate between -s (63%), zero marking (27%) and reduplication 
(9%). Nouns with definite determiner were marked with -s plural (81%) and zero marking (18%) 
without the occurrence of reduplication and dem. Nouns with non-numeral determiners such as 
som, a lot of and others select between all the possible plural markers but favour -s (69%) and 
zero marking (24%) more than others (reduplication 3%, dem 1.7%). Nouns with no determiner 
favours -s (82%) than other plurals, zero marking (14%) reduplication (2%) and dem (1%). 
Speakers marked nouns with numeric determiner with -s (87%) and zero marking (12%).  I see 
that nouns with demonstrative determiners and non-numeric determiners favour zero marking up 
to 27% and 24% respectively and have the least amount of -s. Table 11 below shows how the 
plurals are distributed by type of determiner.

Overall, I have seen that -s is the dominant plural used in the data across all variables. 
The younger speakers use -s relatively more than the older speakers while the older speakers use 
zero marking relatively more than the younger speakers. The female speakers use -s more than 
the male speakers, while the male speakers use zero marking than the female speakers. 
Reduplication is used more by the younger speakers than the older speakers and while dem is not 
much in the data, it is particularly absent from the speech of the younger speakers. I was 
expecting to find dem in the data, but I did not find many examples. This could be because all the 
participants of my study are highly educated and dem is associated with lower education 
Ogunmodimu (2014). I cannot say much about this because of the small numbers but this will be 
further discussed in section 5.5. As -s and zero marking are the dominant plural markers used, 
nearly to the exclusion of all other markers, I will look at these two in the next section. As seen 
in figure 11 (p. 56), even though the morphological -s is the dominant plural used in the data, I 
notice that the older male speakers (based on birth year at the bottom of the chart) tend to use 
more zero marking than other groups of speakers, including the older female speakers. 
 
4.3 Statistical analysis 
For the statistical analysis, the variants examined were limited to two: the morphological plural -
s and zero marking. These two were chosen because they were the main plurals used, making up 
approximately 95% of the data, while the other two factors, the postnominal plural dem and 
reduplication of nouns/adjectives were less than 5% of the entire dataset. There was not enough 
data in the latter two factors to yield any significant results regarding their predictors, and so they 
were omitted from the analysis with the goal to observe patterns between the two primary plural 
markers. A generalized linear mixed effect model which contained speaker and noun as random 

55 
 
effects was fit to the dataset in the R model (McCulloch & Neuhaus 2014). Fixed effects in the 
model were a two-way interaction between age category and gender, all social factors (age, 
gender and dominant language) and the linguistic factors (animacy, type of nominal reference 
and type of determiner). I expected some of the linguistic predictors like animacy and type of 
determiner to be statistically significant because they were found to be significant in 
Tagliamonte et al (1997) study. The morphological plural -s in their study was identified as the 
most frequently used plural marker, sensitive to animacy. Also, in Ogunmodimu (2014), animate 
referents strongly favoured -s more than inanimate. Therefore, I expected these predictors to be 
significant. The R code for this model is given in (37).

The statistical results in Table 12 show the variables that remained after non-significant 
variables were removed from the model. The variables remaining are gender and dominant 

56 
 
language, shown by the asterisks under the p value column. None of the linguistic predictors; 
animacy (animate and inanimate), nominal reference (definite, indefinite and generic) and type 
of determiner (possessive, definite, demonstrative, non-numeric and no determiner) had a 
significant effect on the choice of plural forms.   
Furthermore, although age on its own is not significant, the interaction of age and gender 
is. Specifically, while men are statistically less likely to use the plural form -s, this is especially 
true among the older males. As shown in figure 10 and 11 below, the distribution of the two 
plural forms used by older males is approximately equal, whereas for all other speakers, -s is the 
clear preferred variant. Recall the one speaker in the younger group who is somewhat of an 
outlier within the group, with a birth year of 1985 while the others had birthyears of 1994-2001.  
I ran the R code for my model again without this speaker and it did not affect the results for age.

57 
 
The tokens (zero marking and -s) produced by individual speakers are seen below in figure 11. 
These are organized by gender and age, as indicated by m/f and birth year on each individual’s 
code.  
Figure 11 - Distribution of  -s and zero marking by individual speakers  
 
 
 
This means that there could be change in progress going on from the use of zero marking to -s 
and for the older generation, where the female speakers are ahead in this change. I will discuss 
this in section 5.2. 
Dominant language is also a significant factor in the choice of plural used by speakers of 
NPE. The statistical analysis confirms the significance of the descriptive results, where zero 
marking is used more by speakers who have Hausa, NPE and Yoruba as dominant languages 
than those whose dominant language is English. 

58 
 
The statistical analysis suggests that age and gender are the most relevant potential 
indicator of change in progress. Also, the dominant language of a speaker may play a role in the 
choice of plural used as the statistical analysis shows. In the next section, I will expand on this.

Chapter 5: Discussion 
In section 5.1 I discuss the results of age, gender in 5.2, dominant language in 5.3, linguistic 
factors in 5.4 and the plural marker dem in 5.5. 
 
5.1 Age  
As results from the statistical analysis above show, the interaction between age and gender are 
significant in determining the use of plural markers in NPE. This means that the interaction of 
both variables is predictive in the choice of plural marker used, not simply the individual variable 
age. Specifically, the older male participants tend to use zero marking more than any other 
speaker groups. The fact that older speakers (specifically the males) favour zero marking more 
than the younger group and the women, is evidence that zero marking is the older variant. This is 
because from literature regarding change in progress, there is often an interaction where younger 
women lead change in progress, while the older men lag behind (Labov 1963, Tagliamonte 2011, 
p. 62). This interpretation is strengthened by the contrast between older studies which show zero 
as the main plural in NPE (Faraclas 1989 and Mafeni 1971) and more recent studies with -s as 
the main plural in NPE (Tagliamonte et al 1997, Ogunmodimu 2014 and Deuber 2005).  
Recall from section 2.2.2. that the apparent time hypothesis tells us about language 
change through comparison of the frequency of use of a language feature among different 
generations of speakers. The difference in the frequency of use of a feature from older to 
younger generation points us to language change.  Therefore, our apparent time study suggests a 
change in progress in reference to plural marking in NPE from .zero marking to -s. -s is 
dominant in the grammar of the younger generation than that of the older generation, with very 

60 
 
little use of the older variants (zero marking) respectively. Age on its own is not significant, but 
it is the interaction of age and gender that is significant.  
 
5.2 Gender 
Women used -s more than men, who in turn used zero marking more. As has been shown in this 
study, -s is a plural marker that is available in English language. English has a higher prestige than 
NPE because English is the official language in Nigeria (as is discussed in section 1.1.1). We know 
that women produce linguistic forms that more closely approach that of the standard language than 
men (Trudgill 1972, Kristian 2018, among others).  Based on the results of my study and since -s has 
higher prestige, being affiliated with the English language, this could be the reason that women, 
particularly in the older generation, use it more than men.  
 
The literature shows us that women tend to lead language change (Eckert 1989), and my data 
shows that women are using -s more than the men. This reinforces the interpretation that this is 
language change. That is, in addition to the apparent time difference between older and younger 
people, women are also using the younger people’s variant -s.  The older male speakers are seen to 
use more of the older variant (zero marking) than the newer variant (-s). This is supported in Labov 
(1990), who argues that of all the sociolinguistic principles, the clearest and most consistent one is 
the contrast between women and men;  that the mechanism of change crucially involves the initiating 
role of women at the outset, and the later adoption of the change by men (Labov 2001, p. 283). An 
example is seen in Eckert’s (1989) study of Detroit English where for the factor gender, girls were 
found to be leading in different phonological changes like the raising of /ae/, and the fronting of /a/. 
This pattern where females lead the change correspond with this study’s result, with women leading 
the change from zero marking to -s. In our study, the two variables (age and gender) interact such 

61 
 
that the older male speakers are still using the older variants while the younger female speakers 
accelerate in their use of new forms (-s). I argue therefore that this study shows that there is a change 
in progress led by the younger female speakers. 
To explain the change from zero marking to -s, it could be that the more use and exposure 
of NPE speakers to the formal English language, the more the grammatical features of English 
are borrowed into NPE (Ogunmodimu 2014). This is made easy because English is the lexifier 
language for NPE and most of its vocabulary is English. It is therefore common for there to be 
transfers between both languages. An additional factor adding to language change from -s to zero 
marking is that the younger speakers are now exposed to English language as their first language 
and are later exposed to NPE (as confirmed by most of the younger speakers). So, it could be 
common for them to use some rules of the grammar of English in NPE, like in plural marking. 
On the other hand, most older speakers learnt their native language and NPE first before being 
exposed to English language when they were later enrolled in school (Ihemere 2006). This also 
shows the influence of dominant language of the speaker which is discussed in section 5.3 
below.  
 
Ogunmodimu (2014) is the only sociolinguistic study on plural marking that set out to look at 
speaker gender as a factor, stating in passing the absence of significant differences for speaker gender 
(p.15), without showing the distributions. The author did not mention the number of male and female 
participants in his study and only age ranges were provided (22-59, 28-25).  Tagliamonte et al (1997) 
did not look at age and gender differences either.  Therefore, there are no previous studies with which 
I can compare the age and gender distribution of my study.  My study is the first to compare ages and 
provide an even distribution of male and female, older and younger generation of participants. 
Because of this, I am able to see more clearly that this is a change in progress. Ogunmodimu (2014) 

62 
 
stated that there was no significant difference in the use of plural markers by gender which is 
significant in my study. His result may have been different since it is also the interaction of age and 
gender that is significant for the choice of plural used in NPE.  
 
5.3 Dominant Language 
Apart from looking at -s and zero marking as the newer and older variant respectively, which 
coincide with the distributional use of these markers by speaker age and gender, it is important to 
discuss the factor dominant language, since it was found to be significant in the statistical 
analysis. As seen in figure 5 (p. 43), Yoruba, NPE and Hausa language-dominant speakers used 
zero marking more than the English-dominant language speakers. This may be because in 
Yoruba and NPE, zero marking can be used as a plural marking strategy. Therefore, for the 
Yoruba speakers, it could be as a result of substratum influence, as suggested in previous 
research (Tagliamonte et. al 199, Ogunmodimu 2014), and for the NPE speakers, it may be 
because NPE is their dominant language. As mentioned earlier, not much can be said concerning 
the Hausa dominant language speaker, because only one participant spoke Hausa as a dominant 
language. No generalization can be made, because the difference could be as a result of the 
speaker’s idiolect. I have seen that the Yoruba, NPE and Hausa dominant language speakers use 
zero marking more than the English speakers which shows that dominant language is a 
significant factor for the choice of plural used in NPE. 
Ogunmodimu (2014) lists the types of plural marking strategies used in some Nigerian 
languages, including Yoruba, where there is the use of a third person plural pronoun as a number 
marker (preceding the noun), reduplication of adjectives and zero marking. I expected that 
Yoruba-dominant language speakers would use postnominal plural dem and reduplication of 

63 
 
adjective/noun more to mark plural marking, if these occurred in my data, because these 
srtategies are present in the language, but this was not the case. I did not specifically stratify for 
dominant language, and so there is not enough data for each dominant language in my data for a 
more effective conclusion. It could be a good path for future research, as it was statistically 
significant in my study. 
 
5.4 Linguistic Factors  
Contrary to Tagliamonte et al’s work, which found determiner and animacy to be significant in 
the choice of plural marker used, my study did not find any linguistic factor that predicts the use 
of a particular plural variant in a statistically significant way. Tagliamonte et al. (1997) state that 
it is generally the case that NPs ranking higher on the animacy hierarchy (e.g. those referring to 
humans) feature a number distinction, while those ranking lower do not. So, the factor of 
animacy may be expected to exercise a statistically significant effect on the presence of overt and 
null markers, with animate nouns favouring the former. Animate NPs appear to be somewhat 
more likely to take -s, but it was not significant in this study. For nominal reference, the 
predictions of Tagliamonte et al (1997) was that overt marking will occur more in definite 
contexts, though definiteness was not a statistically significant factor in their data. In my data, 
this is not the case, as definite NPs had the most zero marking used to signal plural. It was also 
predicted that generic reference would surface without overt marking, and NPs with generic 
referents in their data showed a greater propensity to surface bare than any other NP type. This is 
still not the case in the data of this study, since generic did not have any significantly large 
amount of zero marking used as seen in figure 8 above (p. 50). I also expected that dem would 
favour definite NPs because in other creoles like Jamiekan and Gullah, dem is used with definite 

64 
 
nouns (Mufwene 1986). I cannot say the same for NPE, however, because I do not have enough 
data for dem in this study.  
 
  For type of determiner, although demonstrative determiners occurred only a few times 
in the data (11 times), nouns with demonstrative determiners and non-numeric determiner favour 
zero marking more than the other determiner types as seen in figure 9 above (p. 53). Again, in 
Tagliamonte et al’s study, NPs with number-neutral determiners such as possessive, definite and 
bare nouns favoured null marking on plural nouns, while those with number transparent 
determiners, i.e., numeric and non-numeric quantifiers, tend towards overt marking with -s. 
According to the authors, it countered the received wisdom about plural marking in creoles, 
which is that overt marking should be favoured in contexts where plurality has not been 
otherwise disambiguated in the NP headed by the noun in question. This may explain why nouns 
with demonstrative determiners and non-numeric determiners which are not supposed to favour 
overt marking (in this case -s) is at least seen as slightly favouring zero marking more than others 
in my data (see figure 12 below).  Although I found no statistically significant linguistic factors 
in my study, it is possible that with more data, a different result may be obtained. 
 
5.5 The Plural Marker dem. 
This study arose from the question of the disappearance of dem as a plural marker in NPE as 
obtained in previous research (Tagliamonte et al. 1997, Ogunmodimu 2014). As a native speaker 
who still uses dem as a plural marker in my grammar of the language, I believed an explanation 
of this could be that there is a change in the language as it relates to the use of plural markers. 
This change from the use of dem to -s could be as a result of borrowing from the lexifier 
language, English over the years (Ogunmodimu 2014). Since none of these studies (Tagliamonte 

65 
 
et al. 1997 and Ogunmodimu 2014) looked at age as a factor of this change, it was expected that 
this study would find that the older speakers use more of dem as their plural marker than -s and 
vice versa for the younger speakers. Though this was the case, there were just few tokens (7) of 
dem. Both my study and Tagliamonte’s study target educated participants, so in order to find 
dem, maybe education should be one of the factors investigated. Deuber (2005) also argued that 
the use of postnominal dem as a plural marker has disappeared from the speech of the average 
educated NPE speaker, -s becoming the norm (p. 119). This suggests that education plays a 
major role in the choice of plural marker used in NPE. As put by Ogunmodimu (2014), my data 
may be limited in scope and may not be a good sample of NPE speaking community, given that 
all the interviewees are educated middle class Nigerians living in Canada. However, 
Ogunmodimu’s study of the same variable, that investigated  ethnicity (interviewing participants 
from different ethnic groups in Nigeria) and education, did not produce different results, as -s 
was the dominant plural marker used in his data and dem the least, occurring 9 times out of 449 
tokens. This has led me to consider other reasons for the low occurrence of dem.  
Since NPE is spoken in different geographical areas of Nigeria, and has been nativized in 
some areas like the Niger Delta part of the country (Agheyisi 1988), it could be the case that the 
variety of pidgin spoken and the education of the speaker could play major roles in the use of 
plural marking in the language. This is supported by Ogunmodimu (2014) who states that dem is 
still commonly used as a plural marker in the NPE variety spoken regions where NPE is 
nativized like in the Niger Delta and the South Eastern part of the country as confirmed by data 
collected in his field work. But Benin, Warri, and Sapele were the only Niger Delta regions that 
his participants who used dem were from, but he did not have participants from Port Harcourt, 
the capital of Rivers state where I acquired my grammar of NPE, and where NPE is spoken as a 

66 
 
first language of many (Ihemere 2006). This may be a reason why there was not much dem in his 
data. Faraclas’s (1989) study was based on transcribed interviews of Nigerians living in Port 
Harcourt between 1985 – 1986 and he stated that dem is the main plural used in NPE. The dem 
plural may still be a strategy used often by people in this area who are native speakers, possibly 
uneducated speakers who do not have a command of the formal English language. This is still 
supported in the Goldvarb result for dem in Ogunmodimu’s (2014) study that shows that the 
speaker’s education level is a significant factor, with higher levels of education disfavoring dem.

Conclusions 
In this quantitative study, the use of plural markers in NPE as investigated. The variants of the 
study were the morphological plural -s, zero marking, reduplication of adjectives/nouns and 
postnominal plural dem. The social factors investigated were age, gender and dominant language 
and the linguistic factors investigated were animacy, determiner type and nominal reference. The 
distributional analysis shows that -s is the dominant plural used in NPE and mostly by the 
younger speakers. The younger speakers used reduplication of adjectives/nouns more than the 
older speakers. The other two plural marking strategies, dem and zero marking were found to be 
common among older speakers. The dominant markers, -s and zero marking, were further 
analyzed statistically using R. The statistical results showed that the interaction of the social 
variables age and gender is significant in the choice of plural marker used. Specifically, the older 
male speakers use zero marking significantly more than the variant -s. Gender was also 
significant, with -s being associated more with female speakers and zero marking being 
associated more with male speakers. Dominant language (NPE, Yoruba and Hausa) was also 
found to be significant, which may indicate substratum influence. The linguistic factors were not 
significant, and this could be as a result of insufficient data, since it was found to be significant 
in previous studies (Tagliamonte et al 1997, Ogunmodimu 2014).  
 
The fact that older literatures (Faraclas 1989, Mafeni 1971, Agheyisi 1971) recognized 
dem as the dominant plural marker, while more recent studies (Tagliamonte 1997, Deuber 2005, 
Ogunmodimu 2014) including this study shows that -s is the dominant plural marker with a rare 
occurrence of dem in the data, indicates that there is a change going on in the language, at least 
among educated middle-class speakers. This study has shown that the younger generation of 
speakers and the female speakers are the leaders of this change and the older male speakers are 

68 
 
slower to adopt this change, which conforms with results from previous sociolinguistic studies 
(Labov 2001, Tagliamonte 2011). This study is therefore a good indication that there is a change 
in progress in the plural marking in NPE, at least for middle-class educated individuals. The 
change could also be as a result of familiarity with English or as a result of the prestige of 
English. Further studies could investigate education and geographical area (specifically Port 
Harcourt-Nigeria) as factors that could affect that use of plural markers in NPE.
