Hey listen up, I got a science lesson
Got a little organelle, gotta make an impression
It's small but mighty, yo it's the powerhouse
Crushing glucose, so time to be quiet as mouse
Mitochondria, it's the energy producer
Breaking down food, yeah, it's a real juicer
Got the ACP flowing, keeping us alive
Giving cells the power, helping them to thrive
Mitochondria, powerhouse of the cell
Shining bright like a supernova, can you tell?
Keeping us energized in every single way
Mitochondria, we gotta give it, listen up
I got a science lesson, got a little organelle
