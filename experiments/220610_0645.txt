I was at the beach, my brain's legs, my pizza, my brain's dead, my pain's legs, and my gateway
One time to leave, I caught Jay-Z, buh-buh-buh-buh from the G-G, a little feeling, a little
baby dream, a little pleatement, book killer, I'm off, police shot, I love the book meal
And I'm hooked, man, I'm kind of no big deal, I turn one, I miss it, better bum me, I love
big rent, I'm like, tap my car, I leave, sub-side, I'm like, set up, I'm right, tied my hand
Thank you
