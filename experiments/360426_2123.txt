What is Knowledge?
A Crash Course in Epistemology
Written and Narrated by J.M. Kaczynski
Knowledge is always
knowledge of truths. One is aware
of objects, and one knows truths about them,
but one does not know them, at least not in the
sense in which one knows that 1 plus 1 equals 2.
A truth is a true proposition.
A falsehood is a false proposition.
When one makes a statement, the thing
one is thereby affirming is a proposition.
If I say, John Smokes, and I do so knowing what
my words mean, and with the intention of affirming
that meaning, the thing I am affirming is the
proposition that John Smokes.
This proposition is not a linguistic expression.
It is what is meant by such an expression,
and is therefore not itself such an expression.
And this thing is not a belief, it is the object
of a belief, and is therefore not itself a belief.
Nor, by parody of reasoning, is it identical with any other
sort of mental entity.
When it is said of a belief, or a sentence, or a speech act,
that it is quote-unquote true,
what is meant is that the corresponding proposition is true.
This is obviously not what is meant
when a proposition is described as true.
In a moment, it will be said what is meant.
Propositions are not facts.
That is to say, they are not spatiotemporal entities.
They are not structures that consist of occupants of space-time.
The proposition John Smokes can be affirmed,
denied, believed, doubted, etc.
But it cannot be physically altered.
In fact, it cannot be altered in any way.
This is because it is not itself spatiotemporal.
Also, even if John does not smoke,
the proposition John Smokes exists.
No proposition depends for its existence on its being true.
Therefore, truths, true propositions, in other words,
are not distributions or redistributions of mass energy.
A proposition is a class of properties,
of characteristics, in other words.
And for a proposition to be true
is for the members of the corresponding property set
to be instantiated.
Let K be the smallest set
containing the following three properties.
P1, the property of being identical with John.
P2, the property of smoking.
And P3, the property of being a thing X,
such that X is identical with John,
and such that X smokes.
John smokes if, and only if,
these three properties are jointly instantiated.
In other words,
if they are instantiated, then John smokes,
and if John smokes, they are instantiated.
Therefore, the proposition John smokes is to be identified with K,
and that proposition's being true
is to be identified with those three properties
being jointly instantiated.
To be sure, if P3 is instantiated,
then so are P1 and P2.
So it might seem that John smokes could be identified with P3,
and that its being true could be identified with P3s being instantiated,
it being unnecessary to identify that proposition with K,
since K contains P1 and P2.
But there are two conditions that a viable theory of truth must satisfy.
First, it must account for any given proposition's truth conditions.
In other words, for any given proposition T,
if T is true under such and such circumstances,
then a viable theory of truth must account for that fact.
And if T is false under thus and such circumstances,
a viable theory of truth must account for that fact as well.
At the same time, a viable theory of truth
must also do justice to the internal structural properties of propositions.
It must account for their decompositional properties, in other words.
It is a datum that John smokes has a discrete part corresponding to John,
a second discrete part corresponding to smokes,
and a third part, this being an improper part,
corresponding to the fusion of the two.
Our theory is consistent with these facts about the decomposition of John smokes.
In general, our theory, unlike the other theory considered,
is consistent with the decompositional properties of propositions.
It is truths that are known.
Falsehoods can be believed, but they cannot be known.
And true beliefs must be justified if they are to be knowledge.
If I have a correct belief, but I have it for the wrong reasons,
it is not knowledge.
If I believe that all people who wear earmuffs are geniuses,
and I believe on that basis, and on that basis alone,
that my earmuff-wearing friend Fred is a genius,
I do not know that Fred is a genius,
even if, as it happens, he is a genius.
But even though all cases of knowledge are cases of justified true belief,
not all cases of justified true belief are cases of knowledge.
If I look at a broken clock, that happens to be right,
and on that basis I believe it to be 2 p.m.
I do not know it to be 2 p.m.,
even if, given the information available to me,
I am justified in believing the clock to be reliable,
and even if, consequently, I am justified in believing the time to be 2 p.m.
In order for my belief to be a case of knowledge,
it is necessary that, in addition to being true,
it be the end result of processes that are information-transmissive.
For a physical process to be information-transmissive
is for it to be structure-preservative.
When you talk into a phone,
the sounds you make are converted into electrical impulses
that are structure-identical with those sounds,
and the other person's phone converts those impulses
into sounds that are structure-identical with them,
and therefore with the sounds that you originally made.
By thus preserving structure,
this process transmits information.
If, on the basis of the readout of a broken clock,
you believe the time to be 2 p.m.,
your belief is not the end result of a structure-preservative process,
and it therefore does not embody information about the external world,
notwithstanding that it is true and justified.
But suppose that the clock were functioning properly
and were set to the right time.
In that case, the readout on the clock would be hewed to the time,
in which case the readout on the clock
would be genuinely information-transmissive with respect to the time,
in which case your belief that it was 2 p.m.
would embody such information and would therefore be knowledge.
There are two kinds of knowledge,
empirical and analytic.
Analytic knowledge is knowledge of purely conceptual truth.
For example,
any given circle is a closed planar figure.
Another example is
nothing can be literate without being animate.
An empirical truth is an observation-based truth.
No knowledge is strictly observation-based.
There is always a ratios-native component.
Knowledge is analytic when there is no empirical component to it.
Otherwise, it is empirical.
The fact that no knowledge is strictly observation-based
is a consequence of the fact that it is propositions that are known,
not objects.
One observes objects.
One does not observe truths.
In other words,
one does not observe true propositions.
One observes assemblages of spatiotemporal entities,
in virtue of which truths hold,
but one does not observe truths per se.
This is a corollary of the fact cited earlier
that truths are sets of properties.
One observes instances of properties,
not properties per se.
One observes particular instances of roundness,
tallness, redness, etc.
One does not observe the corresponding properties.
Also, given any one empirical proposition,
there is no one sort of observation
that warrants acceptance of that proposition.
And given any observation, or observation class,
there is no one sort of proposition
whose acceptance is thereby warranted.
Consider the proposition John Smokes.
There is no one sort of observation
that warrants acceptance of that proposition.
And any observation, or class of observations,
that warrant acceptance of that proposition
also warrant acceptance of many other propositions.
Also, one observes only what is,
not what isn't,
nor, a fortiori, what cannot possibly be.
When I look inside a room,
I see what is in the room,
not what isn't.
I don't see John's absence.
I see various presences,
and on that basis,
deduce that John is absent.
In general, negative truths
are not known strictly on the basis of observation.
The same is true of disjunctive truths,
truths of the form either P or Q.
It may be that my visual perception
of the new car in John's driveway
warrants acceptance of the proposition
either John bought a new car
or that car belongs to a houseguest.
But if so,
that is because my perception
directly warrants acceptance
of some non-disjunctive proposition.
Some proposition along the lines of
there is a new car in John's driveway,
which, in its turn,
warrants acceptance of the aforementioned disjunction.
There cannot possibly be any
strictly observational basis
for acceptance of statements of the form
Q follows from P,
which means
P is incompatible with not-Q,
which, in turn, means
the joint truth of
not-Q and P
is an impossibility.
Since one cannot observe
what isn't,
let alone
what cannot possibly be,
observation cannot,
at least not by itself,
warrant acceptance
of any statement of the form
if P then Q.
Also,
belief,
and therefore knowledge,
necessarily involves
classification,
to believe that
John smokes
is to believe that
John belongs
to the class of smokers.
To believe that
Chester is green
is to believe that
Chester belongs
to the class of green things.
But sense perception
cannot itself result
from an act of classification,
since such an act
would presuppose awareness
not just of the object
being classified,
but also of its having
such properties
as to warrant
its being classified
in a certain way.
Therefore,
a sense perception
could result
from an act of classification
only if there were
some other
prior state of awareness
from whose content
that of the sense perception
were derived.
But in that case,
that other awareness
would be the sense perception.
A sense perception is,
by definition,
an awareness
of an occupant
of the external world
that is non-inferential.
Classification is a form
of inference,
and sense perception
therefore precedes inference.
Thus,
it isn't that
some truths
are known
strictly on the basis
of observation
and others are not.
It is rather that
no truths
are known
strictly on the basis
of observation.
No knowledge
is strictly empirical.
Some knowledge
is partly empirical.
What we call
knowledge
is conceptually
articulated awareness.
It is one thing
for me to be aware
of the uncomfortable
tightness of my shoes.
It is quite another
for me to know
that my shoes
are uncomfortably tight.
I cannot
know the latter
without having
various concepts
shoe,
tight,
uncomfortable,
foot, etc.
But I can certainly
experience
an uncomfortable
feeling in my feet
without having
those concepts,
and indeed
without having
any concepts.
My having knowledge
of that truth
involves my
conceptualizing
my feelings
of discomfort.
It involves
my understanding
those feelings
in terms of
the aforementioned
concepts.
Raw observation
gives me
the feeling,
but it is
up to me
to use
the concepts
that I have
to articulate
that feeling
into something
that can be
known.
This is because
to articulate
an observation
is to classify
its contents,
and observation
precedes
classification,
as we just saw.
Therefore,
observation
cannot tell me
how to use
the concepts
that I have
to articulate
the deliverances
of observation.
Observation
could tell me
this only if
observations
themselves
were already
conceptually
articulated,
which they are
not,
for the reasons
just stated.
Therefore,
nothing empirical
is known
unless it is
known how to
interpret observations,
and observation
cannot in all
cases tell me
how it is to be
interpreted.
Given an ability
on my part
to interpret
my observations,
observation can
obviously improve
my ability
to interpret
observation,
but it couldn't
tell me how to
do so unless
I could already
interpret it.
Since,
consequently,
the interpretive
principles involved
in the interpretation
of observation
are not always
themselves known
on the basis
of observation,
it follows that
at least some
knowledge is analytic.
Indeed,
this follows from
the very fact
that we have
observation-based
knowledge.
Given that we
have empirical
knowledge,
it follows that
we have
non-empirical
knowledge.
This follows
because it is
by using
non-empirical
knowledge to
interpret sensory
observations that
we acquire
empirical knowledge.
All empirical
knowledge is
inferential.
I leave it
open whether
all non-empirical
knowledge is
inferential.
Nonetheless,
there is a
significant sense
in which some
empirical knowledge
is non-inferential.
Suppose that
I have
observations of
RAIN and,
on the basis
of my duly
conceptually
articulating those
observations,
believe it to be
RAINING.
In that case,
those inferences
tell me what it
is that I am
observing.
Now,
suppose that I
have observations
of RAIN and,
on the basis
of my duly
conceptually
articulating set
observations,
believe it to
be RAINING and,
on that basis,
believe that there
will be terrible
mosquitoes in the
yard a few
hours hence.
The second set
of inferences
don't tell me
what it is that
I am currently
observing.
They tell me
what will be
the case,
given what it
is that,
according to my
observations,
currently is the
case.
Setting aside
cases of our
speaking falsely,
when we say
of a given
belief that
it is
non-inferential,
what we mean
is that no
inferences were
involved on the
subject's part
other than
such as were
needed to
apprise the
subject of
what it was
that he
observed.
And when we
say of a given
belief that
it is
inferential,
what we mean
is that a
second set
of inferences
is involved.
Our beliefs
about the
past,
future,
and merely
possible are
categorically
inferential in
this second
sense.
Our beliefs
about the
so-called
observable
present are
not always
inferential in
the second
sense.
As previously
stated, all
empirical beliefs
are inferential
in the first
sense.
if I know
that there
currently exists
an x, and
I also know
that x's
always lead
to y's, then
I can deduce,
and therefore
know, that
there will be
a y.
If I know
that there is
a y, and
that y's are
always preceded
by x's, then
I can deduce,
and therefore
know, that
there was an
x.
If I know
that x's
always bring
about y's,
then I know
that if there
were an x,
there would
be a y.
All theoretical
knowledge is
inferential, but
not all
inferential
knowledge is
theoretical.
I know that
John is
sniffing pepper,
and also that
anyone who
does so
sneezes, and
on that basis
I know that
John is going
to sneeze.
This knowledge
of mine is
inferential, but
it is not
theoretical.
Theoretical
knowledge is
theory-based
knowledge.
A theory is
an integrated
body of
propositions that,
if correct,
describes some
otherwise hidden
structural fact about
the spatiotemporal
world.
Theories, when
true, tell us how
the universe is
structured.
To be sure,
sometimes people
use the word
theory to
describe beliefs
about specific
situations, this
being the sense
in which there
are various
quote-unquote
theories concerning
JFK's assassination
and concerning the
authorship of
Hamlet.
But when people
say that Francis
Bacon, as
opposed to
Shakespeare, was
the author of
Hamlet, or that
Lee Harvey
Oswald was
merely the
trigger man, it
being Sam
Giancana, who
really killed
Kennedy, when
people say such
things, they are
not making a
claim whose
scope is confined
to some one
incident.
They are saying
that human affairs
are governed by
forces very
different from
those by which
we believe them
to be governed,
the incident in
question merely
being proof or
evidence of this.
In any case, as
the word theory is
used in science and
in the philosophy
thereof, a theory
is an integrated
body of propositions
that, if correct,
tells us about the
structure of some
comprehensive or
otherwise significant
domain.
Thus, a theory,
if correct,
apprises us of
dependence relations.
More precisely,
theories, when true,
apprise us of
dependence relations
of the causal
variety, not of
the logical
variety.
The statement,
any given
statement is a
consequence of the
negation of its
own negation,
describes a
logical dependence
relation, meaning
that it says how
one statement's
truth value depends
on some other
statement's truth
value.
The statement,
oxygen deprivation
causes death,
describes a causal
dependence relation,
meaning that it
says how one state
of affairs, that of
being alive, depends
on some other state
of affairs, that of
being adequately
oxygenated.
theory, when a
theory is correct, it
does not merely
apprise us of one
causal mechanism.
It apprises us of
systems of such
mechanisms.
Or rather, it
makes it clear how
various causal
mechanisms previously
known to exist are
interrelated.
Relativity theory
explains the null
outcome of the
Michelson-Morley
experiment.
It explains the
Lorenz-Fitzgerald
contraction.
It apprises us of
the phenomenon of
time dilation and
also of the
non-additivity of
volume and mass.
And, most
importantly, it
explains how all of
these things are
interrelated.
Suppose that I
know P, and on
the basis of my
knowledge of a
single causal
mechanism, infer,
and therefore know,
that Q.
In that case, my
knowledge that Q
is true is
inferential, but it
is not theoretical.
But suppose I
know that P, and
on the basis of my
knowledge of the
way in which a
multiplicity of
different causal
mechanisms are
interrelated, I
infer and therefore
know that Q.
In that case, my
knowledge that Q is
true is theoretical.
It is obvious that
things make things
happen, that certain
events are the
consequences of
others.
The button is
pushed, the bell
rings, the rock is
thrown, the window
shatters, and so
on.
According to some
philosophers, we see
events, and sequences
thereof, but we don't
see causal connections
holding among events, and
we therefore don't have
good reason to believe
such connections to
exist.
This is erroneous.
The concept of spatial
occupancy is a causal
concept.
An occupant of a given
region ipso facto,
affects the locations
and trajectories of
other bodies.
The concept of
persistence is a
causal concept.
A thing persists if
its present condition
is the effect of its
previous condition.
What we tend to think
of as causal sequences
are actually cases of
two causal sequences
crossing paths.
The rock is a causal
sequence, and so is the
window.
And when the collision of
the two shatters the
window, that is a
disruption of a causal
sequence, namely the
causal sequence with
which the window's very
existence is identical.
So the question, how do
we become aware of
instances of causation, is
misconceived.
We cannot be aware of
anything persistent, or
therefore of any case of
continuous motion, without,
for that very reason, being
aware of an instance of
causation.
By the same token, if we
want to know what causes
what, we need to know what
is continuous with what.
And this is how we
distinguish actual causal
relations from correlations
that mimic causal
relations.
Suppose that everybody in
small town drives a
Mercedes and also smokes
five packs of cigarettes
every day.
And also suppose that
everyone in small town
either has lung cancer, or
will get it by the age of
40.
The skeptic says, we
don't know what is
responsible for the high
rates of cancer among
small town residents.
Maybe it's that they
smoke too much, but it's
equally possible that it's
because they drive
Mercedes.
The skeptic's position is
wrong and misconceived.
Statistical correlations are
not themselves causal
connections.
They sometimes give us a
rough idea of where to
look for causal
connections, but if we
want to know what causes
what, there is one thing
and one thing alone that
we must know, namely, what
is continuous with what.
The residents of small town
inhale smoke and therewith
tar and other noxious
chemicals, which take root
in their lungs and various
physiological changes
ensue.
The smoking is continuous
with the subsequent cancer.
The Mercedes ownership is
not, and that's the end of
the matter.
If, as many a skeptical
philosopher has alleged,
causal connections were
known only by knowing
correlations, then there
would indeed be no way to
distinguish causation from
correlation.
But that is not how causal
connections are known, ever.
However, sometimes knowledge
of correlations is a precursor
to knowledge of causal
liaisons, but that's all it
is, nothing more.
And the skeptic's position, in
this context at least, is
entirely without substance.
And it is equally without
substance in other domains.
The skeptic asks, how do we
know that we aren't always
hallucinating?
Here's the answer.
If the skeptic is right, our
perceptions come out of
nowhere.
They have no causes.
If the non-skeptic is right,
they do not come out of
nowhere.
So the skeptic's way of
modeling the data is to say
that there is no way to
model it.
The non-skeptic's way of
modeling the data is to
posit continuously existing
realities of which the
realities of which we have
direct awareness are mere
fragments.
Yes, the skeptic replies, but
given only that the non-skeptic's
way of modeling the data is a
good one, it doesn't follow
that it is correct, and it
therefore doesn't follow that
the skeptic's way of modeling
the data is wrong.
The skeptic's reasoning, once
again, is misconceived.
Other things being equal, T1 is
a better theory than T2 if
reality contains fewer causal
anomalies if T1 is correct than
if T2 is correct.
This we know.
This is an analytic truth.
Given that, by this yardstick,
some theory T1 is better than
some other theory T2, does it
follow that T1 is correct?
No.
Does it follow that it is more
reasonable to accept T1 than it
is to accept T2?
Yes.
Also, the skeptic's position isn't
really a position.
His position, for lack of a better
word, is that there is no
explanation to be had.
Contrary to what the skeptic
believes, his position is not
one of cautious conservatism.
The non-skeptic only has to be
right about one thing.
He has to believe that there are
external realities of which our
internal processes are
installments.
But the skeptic has to be right
about infinitely many things,
each of which is independent of
all of the others.
Given any perception, he must be
right to say of it that it comes
out of nowhere.
Also, given some one perception
that persists for some length of
time, what is the skeptic to say
about it?
Is he willing to grant that the
perception's existence at time T1
is causally responsible for its
existence at time T2?
If not, then why does he speak of
a perception, that is, of n
enduring perception?
And surely the skeptic must grant
that mental states endure, and
therefore that a mental state's
existence at one time can be
causally dispositive of its own
existence at later times.
But if the skeptic grants this, as he
must, then he must grant that there
are causal ties.
And if he grants this, then his
position, if he still holds on to it,
becomes even more absurd than before.
The skeptic asks, how can we know the
future?
Given only that things have been a
certain way thus far, says the
skeptic, it doesn't follow that they
will continue to be that way.
We can't know that the past is
indicative of the future unless we
know that the laws of nature do not
change.
But we can't know that they will not
change unless we know that the future
resembles the past.
Once again, the skeptic's position is
misconceived.
The non-skeptic does not hold that the
future will necessarily resemble the
past.
The non-skeptic holds that discontinuity
is harder to explain than continuity.
That which comes from nothing is
anomalous.
That which comes from something is
non-anomalous.
According to the skeptic, that which
comes from nothing is no more anomalous
than that which comes from something.
Which is absurd.
Also, one cannot coherently deny that
one's own mind persists in time.
Therefore, one cannot deny that one's
previous mental condition is responsible
not only for the existence, but also
for the specific character of one's
current mental condition.
And if one holds this, one cannot,
without arbitrariness, deny that the
existence of one's current mental state
is dispositive of the existence of later
mental states, for whose character it will
to some extent be responsible.
And in granting this, one is granting that
how things are does sometimes influence
how they will be.
Thus, we know that, at least sometimes,
something comes from something.
At the same time, we don't know that
something ever comes from nothing.
So, to the limited extent to which the
debate between the skeptic and the
non-skeptic can be decided on strictly
empirical grounds, the non-skeptic's
position, though weak in absolute terms,
is infinitely stronger than the skeptic's
position.
But the really important question is,
whose position is internally coherent?
The answer to which, as we have seen in more
than one context, is the non-skeptic's
position.
And once this is granted, as we have also
seen, the skeptic cannot hold on to his
skepticism without making his position
even more incoherent than before.
