tells her stories of his travels her favorite story despite the sad ending
is about the young orangutan Jenny who is brought from Borneo to the London Zoo
where she finally died of pneumonia in the arms of her keeper Darwin is furious when
he learns that the family clergyman has made Annie kneel on rock salt as
punishment for contradicting him about dinosaurs which she takes as having
become extinct long ago this contradicts their church's position that life is
unchanging and that the earth is very young having returned from his expedition
in the Galapagos Islands 15 years earlier Darwin is still trying to finish a
manuscript about his findings which will articulate his theory of evolution the
delay is caused by anxiety about his relationship with his devoutly religious

established Anglican theology Emma worries that she may go to heaven and he may not
separating them for eternity the film shows Annie through flashbacks and Darwin's
hallucinations as a vibrant apparition who goes her father to address his fears

request tells her Jenny's story once more Darwin is devastated and her death

theory he has quotation mark killed God quotation mark which fills Darwin with
dread in his hallucinations he also feels that Annie disapproves of his
procrastination Darwin receives a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace in 1858 which
details the same findings as Darwin in 20 pages he has mixed feelings about this all
his work may have been in vain but on the other hand as he will not have to write
his book the discord with Emma will heal however Darwin's friends urge him to
continue as his book is much more comprehensive after receiving treatment
at Malvern himself Darwin makes a pilgrimage to the hotel where Annie died the
journey marks a change in him upon his return home he is able to reconnect with
his wife and they speak to each other for the first time of their fears and grief
over Annie's death they specifically speak about the possibility that Annie died
because she was genetically weak as Darwin and Emma are first cousins the renewed
devotion restores Darwin's health and he is able to resume his work Emma's faith in
their marriage is also restored and she regains strength to support his
controversial work Darwin decides that Emma must make the decision about

is no longer so religious but in the US outside of New York and Los Angeles religion rules quotation

quotation mark this Charles Darwin biopic is curiously dispassionate
but creation contains some of director John Amiel's best work and Paul Bettany's performance is not to
be missed quotation mark based on 28 reviews Metacritic assign a score of 51 slash 100 indicating
quotation mark makes or average reviews quotation mark 16 in the New York Times A.O. Scott wrote quotation mark
the film traffics in the pseudo-psychological mumbo jumbo that is the standard folk religion of the film
biography and undermines its interest in reason by dabbling in emotive pop occultism
quotation mark 17 film critic Philip French writing in the observer called the film quotation mark a
complex truthful work that does justice to Darwin's theories and their implications quotation mark
18 while his colleague film critic Peter Bradshaw and the guardian wrote quotation mark this
gentle heartfelt heartfelt and well acted film about Charles Darwin and his personal agony preceding the
1859 publication of quotation mark on the origin of species quotation mark does not
shy away from the issues but it personalizes them and places them in a new context quotation mark 19
in the daily telegraph film critic Tim Roby opined quotation mark bettany has a genius for distraction and reverie
guiding the film intelligently in and out of its soul-searching flashbacks
only the closing shot of father and daughter walking hand in hand feels like a sentimental misstep
the one touch too much in a sad searching piece of work about the reluctant labor of a great idea
quotation mark 20 in screen international senior film critic Fiona Ella Hallin wrote quotation mark bettany is
undoubtedly the film's main asset physically and emotionally convincing as Darwin in a very tricky role
Amiel's core challenge here is to make audiences believe their story parents to 10 children
eminent victorians with an unusual devotion to their brood the author of a book which changed the world
quotation mark 21 writing in the hollywood reporter film critic ray bennett said quotation mark
Amiel's greatest achievement is that creation is a deeply human filled with moments of genuine lightness and high spirits to go with all the deep thinking
