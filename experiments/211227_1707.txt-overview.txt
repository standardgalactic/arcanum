The text from "211227_1707.txt" discusses a concept presented in "Cloud Atlas," suggesting that recording aphorisms is a way to solve the world's problems. It emphasizes the idea of documenting insights or wise sayings as an art form, referred to as recursive lazy programming. The notion parallels the scientific method but is described as being invented by children who use sparse mental representation to conduct experiments even without physical action. Ultimately, it encourages recording aphorisms or thoughts as a method for addressing global issues.
