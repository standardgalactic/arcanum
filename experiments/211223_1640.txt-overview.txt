"Creation," released in 2009, is a British biographical drama directed by John Miel. The film portrays Charles Darwin's relationship with his wife Emma and reflects on their eldest daughter Annie as Darwin struggles to finalize "On the Origin of Species." Starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly, it explores Darwin’s emotional journey, including the tension between his scientific ideas and Emma's religious beliefs.

The narrative delves into how the death of their daughter, Annie—whom Darwin loved dearly—deepens his conviction that natural laws function independently of divine intervention. This belief becomes even more pressing after receiving a similar evolutionary theory from Alfred Russell Wallace. Despite initial reluctance due to discord with Emma, Darwin is encouraged by friends and ultimately reconnects emotionally with his wife.

The film also highlights the challenges Darwin faced in getting his work published amidst personal and societal conflicts over evolution versus creationism. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.

"Creation" received mixed reviews, praised for Bettany's performance but critiqued for its approach to depicting historical events and psychological elements. The controversy surrounding Darwin’s theories was noted as a significant factor influencing its reception, especially in the United States.
