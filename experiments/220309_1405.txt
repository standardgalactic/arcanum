Who am I talking to, if not myself, in the future?
Who am I talking to, if not myself, in the future?
If this is the voice that is going on in my mind all the time,
then why am I not aware of it?
And why does it tell me things I've never heard?
Or does it?
It puts things together in a way that I've never been heard.
For example, I say,
when you are creating a Cistercian numeral,
you think of it as a tree.
With branches.
And so,
you can use toothpicks
to represent
9,999 possibilities.
Remember that when I was looking for the recorder,
it was because I had said something interesting.
Now, what was it?
This is the voice, if this is the voice that is going on in my mind all the time,
then why is the first time, why is this the first time I'm hearing of it?
Well, what did it say in my voice?
It said with just three glyphs you can represent any time and date down to the second.
I was thinking about how someone learning this in 1300 or 1400 was not aware
just how many numbers you had to get to before you ran out.
Or else, they would have used it like this.
They would have just thought four zeros, if you want to represent something in Super Unix time.
So, they would have laid out three and then one.
four, that is four toothpicks, but they would have used branches.
And the shape that they would have drawn is a kind of race car.
You're saying 6,666 looks like a race car,
and I'd say that 9,999 looks like a race car, if you use your imagination.
And so, in those days, no one was thinking of race cars.
And at first, when they wrote them down, they weren't using sticks.
They were drawing them, or is that just the only way to remember them?
Because maybe this was a form of counting that used,
actually, if you think of a digital clock,
and now you can use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 lines to represent an 8,
which means that you can represent all numbers.
But they didn't know how to do this before the digital era.
Not very well, at least, or else they would have constantly been
etching it with chisels into rock,
into wood, and they would have drawn it and written down.
And so, what was the voice saying?
It said,
colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
And that is not just a famous sentence that makes no sense,
but it is proof that grammar is emergent,
and that a child of 6 or 7 can already say things
that have never been heard before,
heard before, never heard before,
never been heard before.
And so, you can say to someone,
how far to Saturn?
And you are implying what?
On average?
Or at this exact moment?
I mean, how long will it take to get there?
Or the distance in kilometers?
What's the difference?
I think I have really, really, really bad imposter syndrome about calculus.
I think I can't understand calculus,
but I might know calculus better than most people.
I am determined to learn calculus,
and to me, calculus means using pebbles to count.
And it is a synonym for calculating,
but it also involves taking the derivative
and tangents
and areas under curves
and rates of change.
And, yeah, this is all things
I have never exactly said before.
I certainly didn't hear it in my head.
But instead,
I was thinking
of something more
than Super Unix time.
I was thinking about
how a Chinese character
is a way of slicing up
space,
and there are only a few strokes,
and so you have a smaller alphabet
in Chinese than in English
or in Latin,
where we need 26
letters.
Now, don't get me wrong,
but if there are
10 basic strokes,
then that's 16 less.
If it's 12 basic strokes,
then that's 14 less.
And then I check it in my head
by seeing it,
they add to 26,
but I don't say that out loud.
Here's another thing
I've maybe never heard,
but I'm always thinking
the impossibility
of showing
your work.
I think I was marveling
at the very first time
that I saw
a multiple-choice test,
multiple-choice test,
or
multiple-choice test,
and the first time
that I was ever told
to show your work,
it was written down,
show your work,
or I was
probably in grade 11
by the time
it was forced upon me.
But everything
was showing your work
when I had no teachers,
I only wrote
my answers
on blank lines
in books.
This is not
a multiple-choice test.
And so, yeah,
the impossibility
of
showing your work
always seems
incredibly ridiculous
because I do
like 500 things
in my head
before I write
the first symbol.
and then
10,000 more
before the second
and 100,000
before the third.
And I can
logarithmically
scale time.
But I can't
change the
configuration space.
This is the voice
that goes on
in your mind
all the time.
This is what
really surprised me
is when I said
who
am I talking to
if not
myself
in the future.
It was a reminder
that all around me
are notes.
They are dictionaries
and encyclopedias.
They are reference books
so that I do not
have to contain
this knowledge
in my head
in order to know it
but I have to
just know where
to look.
This is the voice
in my head.
What have I written
down on the screen?
It says
type error.
Built-in function
or method
object is not
subscriptable.
Then I said
y
equals
np.array
First I had said
let numpy
equal
np
but I technically
said
import
numpy
as
np.
Then after
I created
the array
of 25
2
5
I say
what's y
and it tells me
exactly what I said.
Then I go
y.t
that means
transpose y
so now
it's a column vector
it was a row vector
and I had made it
a matrix
by double
square bracketing
y.shape
I asked
1
3
was a tuple
that gave back
y.t
transpose y
array
I did it again
and I got the same result
because it's not changing
y
so I say
x equals
y
dot t
so I say
transpose y
as a capital T
x dot shape
see it's impossible
to show your work
if you're thinking
about a hundred thousand
things at once
you only have one hand
but then again
if you can
compress space
it doesn't take
nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety nine
glyphs
to know it
you only need to know
six glyphs
and four rules
approximately
and that gives you
a column
of like
like a multiplication
table
if you know the
multiplication table
you can easily
remember
the Cistercian
numerals
and how can anyone
remember
nine thousand nine hundred
nine hundred and ninety
things at one time
and just read it
like a z
go in at the bottom
and to the right
and then up
to the left
as if you're
going backwards
and then forward
to the right
and then what did I say
I said z equals
np.zeros
so what did I really say
I said
let z equal
numpy's function
zeros
which
I passed in
a three
meaning I wanted to have
three elements
then I said
what's z
and it said
array
zero dot
zero dot
zero dot
see I'm
I'm
checking
someone else's
statement
they said
zero vectors
have no effect
if added to another
vector
and I tried it
and it had an effect
z
array
do you already
notice the effect
it converted
the
the zeros
now I haven't added it yet
but after I added
the array
of
zero dot
zero dot
zero dot
zero dot
I
said
zz equals
z plus
y
so
I'm checking to see
it says
zero vectors
have no effect
if added to another
vector
so I added them together
and then I said
what is zz
what is zz
and it's an array
of twenty-five dot
twenty
no
two dot
and five dot
and what did I
give it
give it
at first
I said
twenty-five
two
and five
so it did not
have no effect
it is a zero vector
but it did not have
no effect
because it converted
an integer
into a float
but basically
after that point
if I had given
it
some
floats
then it would be
true
huh
and he
does the same
thing as I do
vectors
in
PyTorch
and TensorFlow
X
point
equals
torch
tensor
25
two
five
X
T
F
exit
tensor
flow
okay
the PT
was
PyTorch
not
pointer
I think
I read it
as a point
X
PyTorch
equals
torch
dot
tensor
of
the list
25
two
and five
then
X
tensor
flow
is equal
to
set
it
equal
to
set
it
equal
to
tf
dot
variable
25
two
five
this is the way
it says return to slides here
this is instructions
for the teacher
when he's giving the presentation he wants to go back to the slides
I think I thank you because I heard their voice heard his voice I didn't know what
it would sound like till I heard it
so it wants another
question
what is the
transpose
of
ZZ
it gives me a column vector
25
2
and 5
hmm
the light has flickered
I'm boring myself to death now with my speech because I don't want to hear all of my thoughts out loud
I can have way bigger thoughts if I don't use words because I can think of things that are multidimensional
