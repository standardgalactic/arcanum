The provided text is quite brief and lacks context or detailed content. The mention of being "at the cleats" could imply a sports-related setting, potentially involving baseball given that cleats are often associated with such activities. However, without additional information, it's challenging to determine the main ideas definitively. The phrase "We'll be right back" suggests an interruption or pause in whatever activity or event is occurring. Overall, the text appears to indicate a momentary break from some ongoing action, possibly related to sports.
