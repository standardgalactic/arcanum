It seems that the root of all evil can be traced back to when God chose the wrong sacrifice.
Everyone knows he should have chosen Cain's.
Anything else would have been insane.
But guess what?
Maybe it wasn't God who chose wrong, but humans who interpret the science.
In this case, God's voice was heard by the arrival of a flock of birds.
And so, if we could go back in time and meet Abel with some oil and herbs, we could make his sacrifice better.
And so, no matter what the weather, you can read the signs.
Because there is a Twitter going on all the time.
It is the rumble and the tweeting of birds.
Nowadays, birds have become so big that they can't leave the ground.
If there was something else I was thinking about, I would love.
Just before, I was talking about the first sacrifice, which if God had chosen correctly, would be called a sack of rice.
In this case, I was thinking that humans all have a hell and color inside.
And this is because I was thinking, what do I have to lose but my hearing and sight?
And not only do we have a hell and color inside, but we all have a snake, which we call our column or vertebrate.
So, human beings know what it's like to be all animals.
So, if you try to think about what an animal feels like, it's almost exactly like a human being.
Except for a lot more scared.
In fact, so scared that you can't even pay attention in class.
So, I guess that's all I have to say.
If I ever have anything interesting on my mind again, I'll try to record.
