Lines of code running through my mind
Synthiacs highlight, it's a rhythm I can't hide
If you made it a turn, my digital sanctuary
Writing melodies in a code repository
Taps and spaces, painting on the screen
Autocomplete makes the music so lean
Indentation, like a bass drop so deep
As I navigate through the code I keep
Go to the beats, the symphony in my hands
The melody to my ultimate command
From lines to melodies, in a digital screen
Calling to the rhythm in perfect harmony
