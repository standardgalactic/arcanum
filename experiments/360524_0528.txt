So, having read about a third of the book,
what do I think of Think Observations on Life by a Generalist?
A Handbook on Understanding, Rodney Coate.
I think that there's not an explicit rule in English
that forbids it, but I think that grammatically
you should consider it's never okay
to put 12 commas after a question mark.
Or at least there's never a situation which is appropriate.
There's no explicit rule that forbids it.
But you should not put 12 commas after a question mark.
It's on page 109.
If 999 people tell me that my book failed,
but one tells me that it is a success,
I will know that I succeed.
I say it's a total success,
except for the fact that you had 12 commas
after a question mark on page 109.
The same page that says,
why don't people listen to reason?
Well, how is it that nobody else has made that grammatical mistake?
I'm only at page 26, so I haven't gotten there yet.
Witness the albeit modest sensation experience
by Atlas Shrugged, a 50-year-old book,
after the first Bush bailout in the late 2000s.
Yet today, as conditions are much deteriorated since then,
little is heard of the breathtaking work.
In reality, the interest spike was primarily caused
by some conservatives consuming the story for validation.
And then he puts a broken dash instead of a M dash.
Most readers simply projecting onto the work.
See, I consider that markup and very annoying.
Interest spike was primarily caused
by some conservatives consuming the story for validation.
Most readers simply projecting onto the work
their own limited understanding of ethics and politics.
Now the book is passé.
He reads passé with the apostrophe after the E
instead of over it.
It's not even supposed to be an apostrophe but an accent.
And then there's an unnecessary
apostrophe at the end of the word songs.
Oops.
Now the book is passé.
If it's supposed to be a quote,
then the apostrophe is supposed to be facing
the other direction and on the other word.
And it's probably supposed to be a double quote.
Oh yeah, and there's a lot of non-gender-inclusive language.
I guess that's my primary criticism.
But that can be easily fixed in edition number
five.
Or later it says update four.

It's oddly suspiciously close to the word
in-coate, which means something that is just beginning
or starting.
That's another thing I observed.
So,
I had another question.
How is it that I used to let children
rummage around my pockets?
It was because I believed
that I had nothing to hide.
Maybe I didn't have any knives
in my pockets at the time.
But I also let children
rummage through my room
and rummage through my home
and rummage through my books constantly.
This can only indicate
that I think that I had nothing to hide.
How is this possible?
That I broadcast
my IP address all the time.
How is this possible?
Because I think everyone
has something to hide
and everyone else's secrets
is much worse than mine.
Like by a million times
somehow I've been raised
in a north set point
where there is no signal.
It says at the end
the author and Clovis
the awesome Aussie.
Aussie is apparently a breed of dog.
Clovis is his name.
Then there is a picture
of him lying sideways
with his shorts on.
This is not a grammatical rule
or a design rule
but it's not appropriate.
Then there is a picture
of the author
up in the very top corner
with no margins.
I'm not sure I approve of that.
And then there is two pictures
of the dog.
Three pictures of the dog
technically.
one of someone
sitting on a couch
holding their phone.
anyways this could have used
a little more design work
on the back.
The front's cool
although it makes no sense.
Oh yeah it's just like
a monkey man or a human
that's facing another one
with some sort of
like appendage
sticking at the front.
Anyways.
yeah that could use
like a little bit
for their work.
And then there's
a bunch of barcodes
around the back.
I bet I didn't see
that all the time.
Manufactured by Amazon.ca
which means that
a book publisher
just printed it on demand.
This is one of 100
one of 1000
one of 1 million
it's not said.
There's a resource section
at the back
there's an invitation.
There is so much
I have not said
in the writing of this book.
There are several books
I own
which I have read
more than once
due to their great value
and a number of others
I plan to read again
for their value
and for pleasure.
Holy crap.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
comments.
I gotta count.
I thought the first time
that it was really annoying
because it confused
my eyes so much
I couldn't suppatize.
And I had to use my finger
to drag it along
and just count
one by one.
It's not very quick reading.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
7 commas in a row.
And for pleasure.
Comma, comma, comma, comma, comma, comma, comma, comma, comma.
Time permitting.
If you found value in this book
there's no grammatical rule
that it forbids it
but it's not recommended.
If you found value in this book
I encourage you to read it again.
I promise you
that you will benefit from that.
Of course every book
that I've ever read
I would like to read again
so that's redundant.
And then there are several
that I've read more than once
so that's quite ambiguous.
Is it 2 times?
12 times?
111 times?
I invite you to correspond with me.
If you found value in this book
or did not
I would like to hear
of your experience.
If you did find value
in this book
then share it.
Now go.
I should have said
now go and tell no one.
The Gospel of Mark
used to end.
Reading maketh a full man
and writing an exact man
franks as bacon.
Okay.
So this is the main reason
why I can't just
search and replace
all the word man
and put it human being.
because I want to preserve
the quotes
if it was in English
and it wrote like that
or is this
a translation in English
at a later date
Francis Bacon may have written
in Latin
for all we know.
But surpassing all stupendous inventions
what sublimity of mine
was his
who dreamed
of finding a means
of communicating
his deepest thoughts
to any other person
though distant
by mighty intervals
of place and time
of talking
with those
who are in India
of speaking
to those
who are not yet born
and will not be born
in 10,000 years
and with what facility
by the different arrangements
of 20 characters
upon a page
Galileo Galilei
is writing in what
Latin or
English
is that how many letters
he was using
did he just not know
how many letters
in the office
dialogue concerning
the two chief world systems
I am moved by the arts
of reading and writing
isn't it magnificent
how a person
can write down ideas
then later on
in one year
or a thousand
have those exact ideas
reproduce
another person's brain
exact ideas
even if alien beings
discovered mankind
see that's better
than the usual
use of the word man
but it could put
humankind
or humanity
and acquired our records
they would
dissatisfier
our writings
and
they too
would experience
the precise ideas
encoded by the writer
is an awfully
idealistic notion
it's unprovable
unless they're writing
in some sort of
symbolic logic
or relational algebra
a million
or more
years from now
should intelligent
beings
still occupy
this land
they will have
evolved into
a new species
other than ourselves
unable to interbreed
with Homo sapiens
yet they will be
using the knowledge
that we started
and experience
that we ourselves
can never have
wouldn't that be
what my prediction
for a million years
from now
they will not
be worried about this
because they will
be breeding
through rhizomatic
CRISPR exchange
with DNA
notebooks
unable to
interbreed
with Homo sapiens
yet they will be
using the knowledge
that we started
maybe they will be
able to interbreed
with mushrooms
and jellyfish
as well
and
experience
that we
ourselves
can never have
hmm
depends on how fast
genetic
research
advances
it is reading
and writing
that is truly
unique to man
see that's awkward
and is a requirement
for stable
intellectual progress
each word
in a language
other than
proper nouns
represents a concept
recall that
concepts are
for saving
thinking
thereby
he's got the
compression theory
of algorithms
making thinking
more efficient
recall that
concepts are
for saving
thinking
thereby making
thinking
more efficient
is it not
possible that
some concepts
make it
harder to
think
or take
more work
to think
recall that
concepts are
for saving
thinking
it sounds like
a shortcut
or heuristic
making thinking
more efficient
I think
it is said
that the
English language
has more
words and
usage than
any other
it is possible
they may be
more than
that
this may be
more than
coincidence
it may be
it may represent
a greater
attempt at
conceptualization
of life
by the
English speaking
peoples
hmm
that is
possibly
inaccurate
language
it may
let's read
it again
this may be
more than
coincidence
it may
represent
a greater
attempt at
conceptualization
of love
I mean
of life
by the
English speaking
peoples
hmm
a greater
attempt at
conceptualization
he says
English people
have
greater than
the Latins
and the Greeks
and the Arabs
the Arabs
had like
100 grammar
rules for
everyone in
English
a thousand
and they
had dictionaries
400 years
before English
and their
grammar
has like
40,000
words in
everyday usage
and we got
like what
20,000
hmm
80,000
I would say
if you know
the Quran
and like
fucking
500
Hadith
this may
be more
than
coincidences
it may
represent
a greater
attempt
at
conceptualization
of life
by the
English speaking
peoples
where we
have no
proof
exactly
that
English
has more
words
than any
other language
when they
all have
generative
grammars
that can
generate
nearly
infinite
number
of
possibilities
which is
like
half a
dozen
words
in fact
you only
need
like
three
operators
to say
anything
that is
possibly
written down
into a
kind of
expression
language
of symbolic
operators
anything
computable
can be
written
in
three
two
one
operators
we can
write
everything
in just
norse
if you
ignore
this
fact
then you
forget
that the
most
expressive
language
is the
most
smallest
if you
want to
use
nor
then it's
going to
be
many
many
books
thick
so
we're
trying
to
compress
the
amount
of
norse
that
we
have
to
use
in
English
this
may be
more than
coincidence
this is
why
we
invented
NAND
gates
this
is
why
we
invented
XOR
gates
AND
gates
OR
gates
this
is
why
we
invented
symbolic
logic
this
may
be
I
think
it's
possible
to
use
just
if
thans
and
and
and
OR
and
a
limited
number
of
operators
it's
called
RISC
we call
reduced
instruction
set
computing
this
means
that
it's
not
always
a
very
general
algorithm
that is
needed
but
sometimes
a
lesser
amount
of
operators
is
better
so
we
could
be
judging
that
the
most
efficient
language
is
the
language
with
the
least
amount
of
concepts
not
the
most
think
observations
on
life
by a
generalist
have
you
noticed
in
this
book
that
some
fundamental
things
have
tended
to
come
in
threes
I
attempted
to
come
up
with
some
grand
theory
to
explain
this
but
as
yet
I
have
made
no
progress
perhaps
the
reader
can
come
up
with
something
I
thought
I
just
thought
I
mentioned
that
well
my
theory
is
that
the
ramans
always
do
things
in
threes
as
mentioned
by
Arthur
C.
Cleck
and
important
goal
of
this
book
was
to
conceptualize
the
issues
down
to
a
manageable
number
of
fundamental
things
to
focus
on
so
here
he
is
arguing
that
the
lesser
amount
of
concepts
is
better
and
earlier
he was
arguing
that
English
is
better
because
it
has
more
concepts
or
greater
attempts
at
conceptualization
anyways
he's
not
necessarily
proving
that
being
a
generalist
is
better
than
a
specialist
I
think
I
should
read
the
whole
book
before
I
finish
commenting
it
says
think
adequately
before
taking
strong
actions
or
positions
or
anything
this
is
the
next
lines
and
important
goal
of
this
book
was
to
conceptualize
the
issues
down
to
a
manageable
number
of
fundamental
things
to
focus
on
I
have
given
you
the
prime
numbers
of
life
that
is
speculative
but
one
final
suggestion
oh wait
he said
that the
mind
was like
a
final
encampment
which is
like
the
settle
cast
in
theory
but
one
but
one
final
suggestion
sums
up
what
I
hope
the
reader
takes
from
the
work
as
a
whole
think
adequately
before
taking
strong
actions
or
positions
on
anything
hmm
the
more
significant
the
act
the
more
grave
its
consequences
the
greater
the
need
for
one
to
know
when
is
correct
but
it
looked
like
earlier
he
was
arguing
that
jumping
to
conclusions
or
taking
shortcuts
was
better
why
don't
people
just
listen
to
reason
and
get
smart
the
easy
way
maybe
I
should
just
read
it
in
my
head
and
then
comment
on it
there
you
go
109
again
where
there's
like
12
commas
after
a
question
right
oh
my
god
and
on
the
same
page
it
says
1
2
3
4
5
6
commas
in a
row
holy
crap
I
have
no
idea
how many
commas
it
looks
like
6
throw
though
probably
I'd
express
to
others
6
commas
so
why
change
why
why
change
that
we
usually
just
use
one
comma
oh
wow
he
does
know
how
to
use
an
m-
but
he
used
a
double
dash
here
on
the
next
page
I'm
assuming
that
he's
named
Rodney
and
he's
a
male
because
he's
got
a
beard
and
he's
wearing
a
old
man
trousers
shorts
and
a
button
up
shirt
with
pockets
that's
not
generally
how
women
dress
or
what
they
generally
don't have
beards
and his
name
is
Rodney
so
I'm
guessing
he's
a
man
and he
used
the word
man
all
the
time
to
refer
to
men
and
women
besides
the
man
thinks
since
oh
you're
right
because
he
thinks
that
Atlas
Shrugged
is the
greatest
book
ever
see
I
wanted
to
offer
a
different
theory
when
he
said
that
there
was
a
passing
fad
or
something
I
was
going
to
say
that
maybe
people
don't
read
it
because
it's
a
horrible
book
aren't
science
and
technology
the
only
fields
of
endeavor
needed
to
solve
our
problems
but
she
says
actually
it's
not
about
skyscrapers
even
though
the
book
is
about
skyscrapers
it
says
somebody
might
come
along
that
doesn't
like
skyscrapers
and
they
will
have
a
kind
of
objective
algorithm
she
called
her
rationality
philosophy
objectivism
because
she
thought
this
could be
very
objective
to
have
a
goal
like
covering
the
world
in
skyscrapers
and
trains
with
hard
steel
rails
that
may not
be
a bad
world
actually
unless
you've
seen
Star Wars
and seen
Carescent
and it
doesn't look
that appealing
to have
no nature
on the
planet
and only
skyscrapers
things
and
I guess
my review
is done
I don't
like
skyscrapers
that much
and I
would like
to replace
something
better
in fact
we should
have to
rule
that
no
building
exceeds
1000 meters
above sea
for 1000
years
I guess
that's it
I hope
you enjoy
this review
of
think
observations
on life
by
general
say
handle
kind of
dead
that's it
