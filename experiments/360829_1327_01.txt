Echoes of Eternia
In a landscape interwoven with crystalline shell, sleek white armor stands at attention.
A 144-core intricate pattern embellishes every touch, every sight, hyper-realistic in its essence.
Green breathes life into awe, an undercurrent that pulses, surrounds, embraces.
A city constructed from crystal stretches towards the sky, resplendent in its purity.
That hill is corrected by the McGovern-DeBablo boundary underly in the distance.
