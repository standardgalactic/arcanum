The text from "360906_2137.txt" discusses challenges and considerations when adapting teaching systems, particularly focusing on issues related to machine learning models. Key points include:

1. **Adaptation of Teaching Systems**: When teaching systems change due to updates in data, the challenge is that the system may not effectively remove or incorporate this new data.

2. **Generalization Failures**: The text explores how a learning system can fail to generalize, which happens when the model does not perform well on new data despite possibly excelling with training data. This issue arises due to underfitting, where the learning curves do not align well with the dataset, indicating poor adaptability of the model.

3. **Underperformance and Overfitting**: There's a focus on scenarios where models underperform on new data while performing well during training. This is often because they have been overfitted to the training data and cannot apply what was learned to new or unseen datasets effectively.

Overall, the chapter provides insights into methods for teaching systems that can help mitigate these issues, ensuring that learning models generalize better across different datasets.
