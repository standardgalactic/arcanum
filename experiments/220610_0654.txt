I was at the gates
I was at the gates
You said my boobs aren't no bullshit
And I'm both trying to tell you
Blood, they're both ma,
that's what's up
That's what's up
That's what's up
Alexance, gates
Sneakskin, my hood
ビd And I'm both образом
They're blood loss
Big Death, they're both ma
That's what's up
That's what's up
That's what's up
Back till my back drops
Walk seals
Don't bite me
Michael's
Corside, holds first
Draw the magnimites
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
