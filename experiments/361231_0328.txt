Lines are falling, running through my mind
Sometimes highlight, it's a rhythm I can't hide
Then they turn my digital sanctuary
Writing melodies in a code repository
Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen
Autocomplete makes the music so lean
Indentation, like a bass drop so deep
As I navigate through the code I keep
Go to the beat, there's a symphony in my hands
The melody to my ultimate command
From lines to the melodies, in a digital screen
Falling to the rhythm in perfect harmony
