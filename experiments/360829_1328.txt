Echoes of Eternia
In a landscape interwoven with crystal and shell, sleek white armor stands at attention.
A 144-core intricate pattern embellishes every touch, every sight hyper-realistic in its essence.
Green breathes life into awe, an undercurrent that pulses, surrounds, embraces.
A city constructed from crystal stretches towards the sky, resplendent in its beauty.
The hills, corrected by a McGovern-DePablo boundary, underlate the distance.
