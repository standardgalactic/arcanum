a letter on the divers mechanical and philosophical inquiries undertaken in the course of my solitude
dearest reader whomsoever this missive may find behold i set quill to parchment to chronicle the
manifold devices and stratagems that have occupied the labor of my mind in this my vast and boundless
exile upon the shores of speculation with not but reason as my compass and the divine spark of
invention to illumine my path i have wandered through the wilderness of thought erecting
structures both grand and curious some fit for the habitation of future ages and others mere
phantasms of air useful only for the delight of contemplation
uh on the cryptographic arts and hidden tongues first let me recount the cunning artifices devised
to veil the written word in secrecy i have set my hand to the forging of many a cipher and hermetic
script among them the standard galactic and demotic variants so that the letters of men might be
transfigured into forms unrecognizable to the common eye with a mind steeped in the dialectics of the
ancients i have conceived also of a logico philosophicus cipher wherein words are rendered
in symbols of mathematics and logic such that a man might write his discourse in the syntax of reason
itself nor is this all for i have penned the clipto a half ravaged tongue wherein latin is marred by
lacunae and the gaping wounds of lost phrases so that only the most erudite scholars may unearth its
meaning moreover in the spirit of mystery i have devised the chero script a cursive hand that runs
as a spectral whisper across the page and the shape form cipher a script most jagged and amorphous
resembling the capricious blotches of an ink-drenched rorschach in my tireless pursuit of opacity i have
hidden words where only the keenest of eyes may behold them some so minuscule as to be perceived
only by the lens of a microscope others concealed beneath the pall of light sensitive inks which
vanish or reveal themselves under the influence of the sun's gaze and in my play with transparency i have
conceived of glassine windows wherein words shine through layered vellum revealing secrets by the
mere turn of a page on the education of the mind by means of play and industry yet not all my works
be veiled in secrecy for i have striven also to sharpen the faculties of men through mechanisms of
instruction i have designed sphere pop wherein nested spheres burst asunder to reveal the hidden order
of logic and in so doing teach the principles of abstract syntax trees no less worthy of note is
my work upon hotkey and search-based workflows wherein the mind of man is taught to dance with
nimbleness betwixt commands and scripts as a well-trained falcon darts through the air in pursuit
of its quarry for those who seek the swiftness of the mind's eye i have contrived reading pacers which
set the words before the gaze of the reader at a measured cadence lest he tarry too long in idle
perusal and as the spoken tongue doth shape the soul of man i have devised a system wherein the
very text of a book doth dwindle in size and stature shrinking as the speaker masters its contents
until at last when fluency is attained the letters disappear altogether a specter of the knowledge now
harbored within on books that speak and vanish like the morning dew and lo i have imagined books
that are not mere silent scribes of ink but living things that demand of the reader his very breath
these i have called repeat after me books wherein each line must be spoken forth lest the tome refuse
to reveal its hidden passages nay more than this the book doth record the utterances of its student
until at last when the whole has been read it stands as an echo of the reader's voice a self-made
audiobook in his own tongue but what if a book were to resist permanence altogether yay i have devised
tomes of variable erasability wherein the ink be mixed with strange alchemies some fleeting as the
dew at sunrise others lingering long but fading anon on the touch of air or light on the harnessing of
the earth and sea for power and plenty not content to remain within the province of letters i have
cast my thoughts upon the natural forces of our world seeking to yoke the tides the heat of the
deep places and the mighty pull of gravity itself i have mused upon kelp farms stretching forth upon the
ocean's breast offering their bounty both as nourishment and as a means to cleanse the foul humors of our
poisoned air i have dreamt of rainforest generators vast contrivances that might summon the green
fertility of eden in the wastelands of our time and restore the mighty forces of nature i have conceived
gravitational batteries wherein the pull of the earth is made a servant of industry but grander still
is my notion of intervulsorial pediments artificial volcanoes that rise and fall at the behest of the
tides and the swelling of steam their very calderas raised aloft by the forces of nature only to descend
again yielding up their hoarded power on the grand aspirations of man in the realm of the heavens
yet what is the earth to a mind that seeks dominion over the stars i have therefore turned my speculation
toward the celestial spheres and conceived hoberman space elevators whose rings expand and contract as
they bear men and materials to the heavens i have pondered also upon the dyson swarm slingshot heat
shield a grand contraption of sun orbiting mirrors bending the very light of the cosmos to shield our
world from harm but perhaps the grandest of my musings is the geostationary pillar a great and lofty
stairway set firm in the heavens from which a traveler might set forth upon a bridge to the moon
his feet never touching the ground indeed i have imagined a skyhook assembly wherein the wares of
earth might be drawn up on a celestial loom woven by gravity and momentum into the very fabric of the
void on the usefulness of dreams that cannot yet be and some will scoff at these visions deeming them
not but folly for they stand beyond the reach of our time as castles upon the mist but i say unto them
what is folly today may be wisdom upon the morrow and that which seemeth a dream is but an idea whose
hour hath not yet come for though the nested hoberman rings the orthodromic rivers and the
intervulsorial pediments may not find their shape in this age they may yet serve as augmented reality
mnemonics guiding the mind's eye shaping instruction and illuminating the path of future generations
thus do i lay forth my works as one who hath drawn maps of unseen lands that they may in time be
traversed and whether these musings bear fruit in my own day or in the centuries to come i leave them
now as a testament to the boundless reach of thought here then i rest my quill and commend these ideas to
the care of the yet unborn minds who shall take them up in ages hence ever yours in speculation and
curiosity a pilgrim of the boundless mind
