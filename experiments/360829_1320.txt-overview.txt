"Echoes of Eternia" describes an ethereal world characterized by its stunning natural beauty and surreal elements. The setting features crystal structures, lush greenery, and sleek white armor, all enhanced with intricate patterns that are hyper-realistic. A city built from crystals reaches toward the sky, and gentle hills stretch into the distance. Within this landscape, a performance between Eloy and Morlock is illuminated by studio light, highlighting contrasts and depth.

Metadynamics influence the environment, hinting at deeper realities beyond what is visible. The natural history of life can be traced in the veins of leaves, while whispers of otherworldly phenomena fill the air. Plate bulbs emit a soft glow, suggesting hidden truths or possibilities. Peace pervades Eternia, where trees and crystals reflect beauty and dreams transcend illusion.

Eternia embodies both mystery and revelation, existing beyond typical understanding as it merges the surreal with the hyper-realistic. It is depicted as an infinite realm of possibility and serenity, inviting those who hear its call to experience a world where reality blurs into dream, and echoes resonate eternally.
