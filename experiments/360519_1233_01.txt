Well, pack up your guitar, we're leaving this town
Gonna hit you out on a rocket, won't be coming back around
We're heading to the skies, to a place so far
Where the banjo strums and the fiddle plays among the stars
Sailing through the galaxy, on a mission to be free
Leaving all our troubles behind, settling on a distant planet we'll find
Oh, among the stars, we'll make our new home
Bluegrass melodies echoing the unknown, ooh yeah
Well, I'm sitting on my porch, with the banjo in my hand
Looking up at the night sky, feeling oh so grand
Near and distant, I see a spark so bright
It's the Andromeda galaxy, shining through the night
Oh, I'm chasing Andromeda, in the starry sky
With my banjo playing, I'm reaching oh so high
From the Milky Way, to Andromeda, I'll go
Singing this bluegrass song, and putting on the show
From the Milky Way, to Andromeda, I'll go
Or be the or the stars, we'll have a
Andromeda Altered by Ten archaeology
The End
You can't eat orange, but theかな
