Yeah, lunar lullaby, a celestial symphony, painted on the canvas of the sky for all to see.
Each night a different moon, a unique melody, from the silver crashing to the full moon's majesty.
From under the spell of the moonlight, guiding us through each starry night, a cosmic carousel, a lunar dance.
Oh, the moon, our eternal romance, together we'll chase all the moons that we can find.
In this magical universe, our souls entwined.
Yeah, lunar lullaby, a celestial symphony.
Yeah, lunar lullaby, a celestial symphony.
