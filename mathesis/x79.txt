convention (already encountered in Section 33.1) is to assume that a summation is performed
for all values of every index that appears simultaneously once as an upper index and once
as a lower index. According to this convention, the tensor α above is written

If E and F are two K-algebras, we know that their tensor product E ⊗ F exists as a
vector space. We can make E ⊗ F into an algebra as well. Indeed, we have the multilinear
map
E × F × E × F −→ E ⊗ F
given by (a, b, c, d) 7→ (ac) ⊗ (bd), where ac is the product of a and c in E and bd is the
product of b and d in F. By the universal mapping property, we get a linear map,
E ⊗ F ⊗ E ⊗ F −→ E ⊗ F.
Using the isomorphism
E ⊗ F ⊗ E ⊗ F ∼= (E ⊗ F) ⊗ (E ⊗ F),
we get a linear map
(E ⊗ F) ⊗ (E ⊗ F) −→ E ⊗ F,
and thus a bilinear map,
(E ⊗ F) × (E ⊗ F) −→ E ⊗ F
which is our multiplication operation in E ⊗ F. This multiplication is determined by
(a ⊗ b) · (c ⊗ d) = (ac) ⊗ (bd).
In summary we have the following proposition.
Proposition 33.22. Given two K-algebra E and F, the operation on E ⊗ F defined on
generators by
(a ⊗ b) · (c ⊗ d) = (ac) ⊗ (bd)
makes E ⊗ F into a K-algebra.
We now turn to symmetric tensors.
1180 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
33.7 Symmetric Tensor Powers
Our goal is to come up with a notion of tensor product that will allow us to treat symmetric
multilinear maps as linear maps. Note that we have to restrict ourselves to a single vector
space E, rather then n vector spaces E1, . . . , En, so that symmetry makes sense.
Definition 33.15. A multilinear map f : E
n → F is symmetric iff
f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(n)) = f(u1, . . . , un),
for all ui ∈ E and all permutations, σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}. The group of permutations
on {1, . . . , n} (the symmetric group) is denoted Sn. The vector space of all symmetric
multilinear maps f : E
n → F is denoted by Symn
(E; F) or Homsymlin(E
n
, F). Note that
Sym1
(E; F) = Hom(E, F).
We could proceed directly as in Theorem 33.6 and construct symmetric tensor products
from scratch. However, since we already have the notion of a tensor product, there is a more
economical method. First we define symmetric tensor powers.
Definition 33.16. An n-th symmetric tensor power of a vector space E, where n ≥ 1, is a
vector space S together with a symmetric multilinear map ϕ: E
n → S such that, for every
vector space F and for every symmetric multilinear map f : E
n → F, there is a unique linear
map f : S → F, with
f(u1, . . . , un) = f (ϕ(u1, . . . , un)),
for all u1, . . . , un ∈ E, or for short
f = f ◦ ϕ.
Equivalently, there is a unique linear map f such that the following diagram commutes.
E

The above property is called the universal mapping property of the symmetric tensor power
(S, ϕ).
We next show that any two symmetric n-th tensor powers (S1, ϕ1) and (S2, ϕ2) for E are
isomorphic.
Proposition 33.23. Given any two symmetric n-th tensor powers (S1, ϕ1) and (S2, ϕ2) for
E, there is an isomorphism h: S1 → S2 such that
ϕ2 = h ◦ ϕ1.
33.7. SYMMETRIC TENSOR POWERS 1181
Proof. Replace tensor product by n-th symmetric tensor power in the proof of Proposition
33.5.
We now give a construction that produces a symmetric n-th tensor power of a vector
space E.
Theorem 33.24. Given a vector space E, a symmetric n-th tensor power (Sn
(E), ϕ) for
E can be constructed (n ≥ 1). Furthermore, denoting ϕ(u1, . . . , un) as u1  · · ·  un, the
symmetric tensor power S
n
(E) is generated by the vectors u1· · ·un, where u1, . . . , un ∈ E,
and for every symmetric multilinear map f : E
n → F, the unique linear map f : Sn
(E) → F
such that f = f ◦ ϕ is defined by
f (u1  · · ·  un) = f(u1, . . . , un)
on the generators u1  · · ·  un of S
n
(E).
Proof. The tensor power E
⊗n
is too big, and thus we define an appropriate quotient. Let C
be the subspace of E
⊗n generated by the vectors of the form
u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un − uσ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ uσ(n)
,
for all ui ∈ E, and all permutations σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}. We claim that the quotient
space (E
⊗n
)/C does the job.
Let p: E
⊗n → (E
⊗n
)/C be the quotient map, and let ϕ: E
n → (E
⊗n
)/C be the map
given by
ϕ = p ◦ ϕ0,
where ϕ0 : E
n → E
⊗n
is the injection given by ϕ0(u1, . . . , un) = u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un.
Let us denote ϕ(u1, . . . , un) as u1  · · ·  un. It is clear that ϕ is symmetric. Since the
vectors u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un generate E
⊗n
, and p is surjective, the vectors u1  · · ·  un generate
(E
⊗n
)/C.
It remains to show that ((E
⊗n
)/C, ϕ) satisfies the universal mapping property. To this
end we begin by proving that there is a map h such that f = h ◦ ϕ. Given any symmetric
multilinear map f : E
n → F, by Theorem 33.6 there is a linear map f⊗ : E
⊗n → F such that
f = f⊗ ◦ ϕ0, as in the diagram below.

If we define h([z]) = f⊗(z) for every z ∈ E

, where [z] is the equivalence class in (E

)/C
of z ∈ E
⊗n
, the above diagram shows that f = h ◦ p ◦ ϕ0 = h ◦ ϕ. We now prove the
uniqueness of h. For any linear map f : (E
⊗n
)/C → F such that f = f ◦ ϕ, since
ϕ(u1, . . . , un) = u1  · · ·  un and the vectors u1  · · ·  un generate (E
⊗n
)/C, the map f
is uniquely defined by
f (u1  · · ·  un) = f(u1, . . . , un).
Since f = h ◦ ϕ, the map h is unique, and we let f = h. Thus, Sn
(E) = (E
⊗n
)/C and ϕ
constitute a symmetric n-th tensor power of E.
The map ϕ from E
n
to Sn
(E) is often denoted ι , so that
ι (u1, . . . , un) = u1  · · ·  un.
Again, the actual construction is not important. What is important is that the symmetric
n-th power has the universal mapping property with respect to symmetric multilinear maps.
Remark: The notation  for the commutative multiplication of symmetric tensor powers
is not standard. Another notation commonly used is ·. We often abbreviate “symmetric
tensor power” as “symmetric power.” The symmetric power Sn
(E) is also denoted SymnE
but we prefer to use the notation Sym to denote spaces of symmetric multilinear maps. To
be consistent with the use of  , we could have used the notation J n E. Clearly, S1
(E) ∼= E
and it is convenient to set S0
(E) = K.
The fact that the map ϕ: E
n → S
n
(E) is symmetric and multilinear can also be expressed
as follows:
u1  · · ·  (vi + wi)  · · ·  un = (u1  · · ·  vi  · · ·  un) + (u1  · · ·  wi  · · ·  un),
u1  · · ·  (λui)  · · ·  un = λ(u1  · · ·  ui  · · ·  un),
uσ(1)  · · ·  uσ(n) = u1  · · ·  un,
for all permutations σ ∈ Sn.
The last identity shows that the “operation”  is commutative. This allows us to view
the symmetric tensor u1  · · ·  un as an object called a multiset.
33.7. SYMMETRIC TENSOR POWERS 1183
Given a set A, a multiset with elements from A is a generalization of the concept of a set
that allows multiple instances of elements from A to occur. For example, if A = {a, b, c, d},
the following are multisets:
M1 = {a, a, b}, M2 = {a, a, b, b, c}, M3 = {a, a, b, b, c, d, d, d}.
Here is another way to represent multisets as tables showing the multiplicities of the elements
in the multiset:
M1 =

a b c d
2 1 0 0 , M2 =

a b c d
2 2 1 0 , M3 =

a b c d
2 2 1 3 .
The above are just graphs of functions from the set A = {a, b, c, d} to N. This suggests
the following definition.
Definition 33.17. A finite multiset M over a set A is a function M : A → N such that
M(a) 6 = 0 for finitely many a ∈ A. The multiplicity of an element a ∈ A in M is M(a). The
set of all multisets over A is denoted by N
(A)
, and we let dom(M) = {a ∈ A | M(a) 6 = 0},
which is a finite set. The set dom(M) is the set of elements in A that actually occur in
M. For any multiset M ∈ N
(A)
, note that P a∈A M(a) makes sense, since P a∈A M(a) =
P
a∈dom(A) M(a), and dom(M) is finite; this sum is the total number of elements in the
multiset A and is called the size of M. Let |M| =
P a∈A M(a).
Going back to our symmetric tensors, we can view the tensors of the form u1  · · ·  un
as multisets of size n over the set E.
Theorem 33.24 implies the following proposition.
Proposition 33.25. There is a canonical isomorphism
Hom(Sn
(E), F) ∼= Symn
(E; F),
between the vector space of linear maps Hom(Sn
(E), F) and the vector space of symmetric
multilinear maps Symn
(E; F) given by the linear map − ◦ ϕ defined by h 7→ h ◦ ϕ, with
h ∈ Hom(Sn
(E), F).
Proof. The map h ◦ ϕ is clearly symmetric multilinear. By Theorem 33.24, for every sym￾metric multilinear map f ∈ Symn
(E; F) there is a unique linear map f ∈ Hom(Sn
(E), F)
such that f = f ◦ ϕ, so the map − ◦ ϕ is bijective. Its inverse is the map f 7→ f .
In particular, when F = K, we get the following important fact.
Proposition 33.26. There is a canonical isomorphism
(Sn
(E))∗ ∼= Symn
(E; K).
1184 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
Definition 33.18. Symmetric tensors in Sn
(E) are called symmetric n-tensors, and tensors
of the form u1  · · ·  un, where ui ∈ E, are called simple (or decomposable) symmetric n￾tensors. Those symmetric n-tensors that are not simple are often called compound symmetric
n-tensors.
Given linear map f : E → E
0 , since the map ι
0 ◦ (f × f) is bilinear and symmetric, there
is a unique linear map f  f : S2
(E) → S

Observe that f  g is determined by

Proposition 33.27. Given any two linear maps f : E → E
0 and f

0 → E
00 , we have
(f

The generalization to the symmetric tensor product f  · · ·  f of n ≥ 3 copies of the
linear map f : E → E
0 is immediate, and left to the reader.
33.8 Bases of Symmetric Powers
The vectors u1  · · ·  um where u1, . . . , um ∈ E generate Sm(E), but they are not linearly
independent. We will prove a version of Proposition 33.12 for symmetric tensor powers using
multisets.
Recall that a (finite) multiset over a set I is a function M : I → N, such that M(i) 6 = 0
for finitely many i ∈ I. The set of all multisets over I is denoted as N
(I) and we let
dom(M) = {i ∈ I | M(i) 6 = 0}, the finite set of elements in I that actually occur in M. The
size of the multiset M is |M| =
P a∈A M(a).
To explain the idea of the proof, consider the case when m = 2 and E has dimension 3.
Given a basis (e1, e2, e3) of E, we would like to prove that
e1  e1, e1  e2, e1  e3, e2  e2, e2  e3, e3  e3
are linearly independent. To prove this, it suffices to show that for any vector space F,
if w11, w12, w13, w22, w23, w33 are any vectors in F, then there is a symmetric bilinear map
h: E
2 → F such that
h(ei
, ej ) = wij , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 3.
33.8. BASES OF SYMMETRIC POWERS 1185
Because h yields a unique linear map h : S2
(E) → F such that
h (ei  ej ) = wij , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 3,
by Proposition 33.4, the vectors
e1  e1, e1  e2, e1  e3, e2  e2, e2  e3, e3  e3
are linearly independent. This suggests understanding how a symmetric bilinear function
f : E
2 → F is expressed in terms of its values f(ei
, ej ) on the basis vectors (e1, e2, e3), and
this can be done easily. Using bilinearity and symmetry, we obtain
f(u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3, v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3) = u1v1f(e1, e1) + (u1v2 + u2v1)f(e1, e2)
+ (u1v3 + u3v1)f(e1, e3) + u2v2f(e2, e2)
+ (u2v3 + u3v2)f(e2, e3) + u3v3f(e3, e3).
Therefore, given w11, w12, w13, w22, w23, w33 ∈ F, the function h given by
h(u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3, v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3) = u1v1w11 + (u1v2 + u2v1)w12
+ (u1v3 + u3v1)w13 + u2v2w22
+ (u2v3 + u3v2)w23 + u3v3w33
is clearly bilinear symmetric, and by construction h(ei
, ej ) = wij , so it does the job.
The generalization of this argument to any m ≥ 2 and to a space E of any dimension
(even infinite) is conceptually clear, but notationally messy. If dim(E) = n and if (e1, . . . , en)
is a basis of E, for any m vectors vj =
P
n
i=1 ui,jei
in E, for any symmetric multilinear map
f : E
m → F, we have

is denoted by M(m, J, k1, . . . , kn). Note that M(ji) = ki

and any u ∈ E, we denote u

as u

.
1186 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
We can now prove the following proposition.
Proposition 33.28. Given a vector space E, if (ei)i∈I is a basis for E, then the family of
vectors


M(i1)  · · ·  e

M(ik)

M∈N(I)
, |M|=m,
{i1,...,ik}=dom(M)
is a basis of the symmetric m-th tensor power S
m(E).
Proof. The proof is very similar to that of Proposition 33.12. First assume that E has finite
dimension n. In this case I = {1, . . . , n}, and any multiset M ∈ N
(I) of size |M| = m is of
the form M(m, {1, . . . , n}, k1, . . . , kn), with ki = M(i) and k1 + · · · + kn = m.
For any nontrivial vector space F, for any family of vectors
(wM)M∈N(I)
, |M|=m,
we show the existence of a symmetric multilinear map h: Sm(E) → F, such that for every
M ∈ N
(I) with |M| = m, we have
h(ei
1
M(i1)  · · ·  e
ik
M(ik)
) = wM,
where {i1, . . . , ik} = dom(M). We define the map f : E
m → F as follows: for any m vectors
v1, . . . , vm ∈ E we can write vk =
P
n
i=1 ui,kei
for k = 1, . . . , m and we set
f(v1, . . . , vm)

It is not difficult to verify that f is symmetric and multilinear. By the universal mapping
property of the symmetric tensor product, the linear map f : Sm(E) → F such that
f = f ◦ ϕ, is the desired map h. Then by Proposition 33.4, it follows that the family

, |M|=m,
{i1,...,ik}=dom(M)
is linearly independent. Using the commutativity of  , we can also show that these vectors
generate Sm(E), and thus, they form a basis for Sm(E).
If I is infinite dimensional, then for any m vectors v1, . . . , vm ∈ F there is a finite subset
J of I such that vk =
P j∈J
uj,kej
for k = 1, . . . , m, and if we write n = |J|, then the formula
for f(v1, . . . , vm) is obtained by replacing the set {1, . . . , n} by J. The details are left as an
exercise.
33.9. SOME USEFUL ISOMORPHISMS FOR SYMMETRIC POWERS 1187
As a consequence, when I is finite, say of size p = dim(E), the dimension of Sm(E) is
the number of finite multisets (j1, . . . , jp), such that j1 + · · · + jp = m, jk ≥ 0. We leave as
an exercise to show that this number is ￾ p+m−1
m

. Thus, if dim(E) = p, then the dimension
of Sm(E) is ￾ p+m−1
m

. Compare with the dimension of E
⊗m, which is p
m. In particular, when
p = 2, the dimension of Sm(E) is m + 1. This can also be seen directly.
Remark: The number ￾ p+m−1
m

is also the number of homogeneous monomials
X1
j1
· · · Xp
jp
of total degree m in p variables (we have j1 +· · ·+jp = m). This is not a coincidence! Given
a vector space E and a basis (ei)i∈I for E, Proposition 33.28 shows that every symmetric
tensor z ∈ S
m(E) can be written in a unique way as
z =

This looks like a homogeneous polynomial of total degree m, where the monomials of

33.9 Some Useful Isomorphisms for Symmetric Powers
We can show the following property of the symmetric tensor product, using the proof tech￾nique of Proposition 33.13 (3).
Proposition 33.29. We have the following isomorphism:
S
n
(E ⊕ F) ∼=
nM
k=0
S
k
(E) ⊗ S
n−k
(F).
33.10 Duality for Symmetric Powers
In this section all vector spaces are assumed to have finite dimension over a field of charac￾teristic zero. We define a nondegenerate pairing Sn
(E
∗
)×S
n
(E) −→ K as follows: Consider
the multilinear map
(E
∗
)
n × E
n −→ K

given by
(v1

, u1, . . . , un) 7→
X
σ∈Sn
vσ
∗
(1)(u1)· · · vσ
∗
(n)
(un).
Note that the expression on the right-hand side is “almost” the determinant det(vj
∗
(ui)),
except that the sign sgn(σ) is missing (where sgn(σ) is the signature of the permutation σ;
that is, the parity of the number of transpositions into which σ can be factored). Such an
expression is called a permanent.
It can be verified that this expression is symmetric w.r.t. the ui
’s and also w.r.t. the vj
∗
.
For any fixed (v1
∗
, . . . , vn
∗
) ∈ (E
∗
)
n
, we get a symmetric multilinear map

from E

to K. The map lv1

∗ extends uniquely to a linear map Lv1

(E) → K
making the following diagram commute:

We also have the symmetric multilinear map
(v1

) 7→ Lv1
∗,...,vn

from (E

)

to Hom(Sn
(E), K), which extends to a linear map L from Sn
(E

) to
Hom(Sn

However, in view of the isomorphism
Hom(U ⊗ V, W) ∼= Hom(U, Hom(V, W)),
with U = Sn
(E

), V = Sn
(E) and W = K, we can view L as a linear map
L: Sn
(E

) ⊗ S
n
(E) −→ K,
which by Proposition 33.8 corresponds to a bilinear map
h−, −i: Sn

33.10. DUALITY FOR SYMMETRIC POWERS 1189
This pairing is given explicitly on generators by

(un).
Now this pairing in nondegenerate. This can be shown using bases.2
If (e1, . . . , em) is a
basis of E, then for every basis element (e

)

n1 · · ·(e

nk of Sn
(E

n, we have

{z

}
).
If the field K has characteristic zero, then n1! · · · nk! 6 = 0. We leave the details as an
exercise to the reader. Therefore we get a canonical isomorphism
(Sn
(E))∗ ∼= S
n
(E
∗
).
The following proposition summarizes the duality properties of symmetric powers.
Proposition 33.30. Assume the field K has characteristic zero. We have the canonical
isomorphisms
(Sn
(E))∗ ∼= S
n
(E
∗
)
and
S
n
(E
∗
) ∼= Symn
(E; K) = Homsymlin(E
n
, K),
which allows us to interpret symmetric tensors over E
∗ as symmetric multilinear maps.
Proof. The isomorphism
µ: Sn
(E
∗
) ∼= Symn
(E; K)
follows from the isomorphisms (Sn
(E))∗ ∼= S
n
(E
∗
) and (Sn
(E))∗ ∼= Symn
(E; K) given by
Proposition 33.26.
Remarks:
1. The isomorphism µ: Sn
(E
∗
) ∼= Symn
(E; K) discussed above can be described explicitly
as the linear extension of the map given by
µ(v1
∗  · · ·  vn
∗
)(u1, . . . , un) = X
σ∈Sn
vσ
∗
(1)(u1)· · · vσ
∗
(n)
(un).
2This is where the assumption that we are in finite dimension and that the field has characteristic zero
are used.
