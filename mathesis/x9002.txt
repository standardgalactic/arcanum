so by the uniqueness of extensions we must have
ϕc1 ◦ ϕc2 = idEb1
and ϕc2 ◦ ϕc1 = idEb2
.
This proves that ϕc1 and ϕc2 are mutual inverses. Now, since ϕ2 = ϕc2 ◦ ϕ1, we have
ϕc2|ϕ1(E) = ϕ2 ◦ ϕ

and ϕ2 are isometries, so is ϕc2|ϕ1(E). But we saw earlier that ϕc2 is the
uniform continuous extension of ϕc2|ϕ1(E) and ϕ1(E) is dense in b E1, so for any two elements
α, β ∈ b E1, if (an) and (bn) are sequences in ϕ1(E) converging to α and β, we have
db2((ϕc2|ϕ1(E))(an),((ϕc2|ϕ1(E))(bn)) = db1(an, bn),
and by passing to the limit we get
db2(ϕc2(α), ϕc2(β)) = db1(α, β),
which shows that ϕc2 is an isometry (similarly, ϕc1 is an isometry).
Remarks:
1. Except for Step 8 and Step 9, the proof of Theorem 37.53 is the proof given in Schwartz
[149] (Chapter XI, Section 4, Theorem 1), and Kormogorov and Fomin [105] (Chapter
2, Section 7, Theorem 4).
2. The construction of Eb relies on the completeness of R, and so it cannot be used to
construct R from Q. However, this construction can be modified to yield a construction
of R from Q.
We show in Section 37.12 that Theorem 37.53 yields a construction of the completion of
a normed vector space.
37.10. THE CONTRACTION MAPPING THEOREM 1383
37.10 The Contraction Mapping Theorem
If (E, d) is a nonempty complete metric space, every map, f : E → E, for which there is
some k such that 0 ≤ k < 1 and
d(f(x), f(y)) ≤ kd(x, y)
for all x, y ∈ E, has the very important property that it has a unique fixed point, that
is, there is a unique, a ∈ E, such that f(a) = a. A map as above is called a contraction
mapping. Furthermore, the fixed point of a contraction mapping can be computed as the
limit of a fast converging sequence.
The fixed point property of contraction mappings is used to show some important the￾orems of analysis, such as the implicit function theorem and the existence of solutions to
certain differential equations. It can also be used to show the existence of fractal sets de-
fined in terms of iterated function systems. Since the proof is quite simple, we prove the
fixed point property of contraction mappings. First, observe that a contraction mapping is
(uniformly) continuous.
Proposition 37.54. If (E, d) is a nonempty complete metric space, every contraction map￾ping, f : E → E, has a unique fixed point. Furthermore, for every x0 ∈ E, defining the
sequence, (xn), such that xn+1 = f(xn), the sequence, (xn), converges to the unique fixed
point of f.
Proof. First we prove that f has at most one fixed point. Indeed, if f(a) = a and f(b) = b,
since
d(a, b) = d(f(a), f(b)) ≤ kd(a, b)
and 0 ≤ k < 1, we must have d(a, b) = 0, that is, a = b.
Next, we prove that (xn) is a Cauchy sequence. Observe that
d(x2, x1) ≤ kd(x1, x0),
d(x3, x2) ≤ kd(x2, x1) ≤ k

d(xn+1, xn) ≤ kd(xn, xn−1) ≤ · · · ≤ k

d(x1, x0).
Thus, we have
d(xn+p, xn) ≤ d(xn+p, xn+p−1) + d(xn+p−1, xn+p−2) + · · · + d(xn+1, xn)

d(x1, x0).
1384 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
We conclude that d(xn+p, xn) converges to 0 when n goes to infinity, which shows that (xn)
is a Cauchy sequence. Since E is complete, the sequence (xn) has a limit, a. Since f is
continuous, the sequence (f(xn)) converges to f(a). But xn+1 = f(xn) converges to a and
so f(a) = a, the unique fixed point of f.
Note that no matter how the starting point x0 of the sequence (xn) is chosen, (xn)
converges to the unique fixed point of f. Also, the convergence is fast, since
d(xn, a) ≤
k
n
1 − k
d(x1, x0).
The Hausdorff distance between compact subsets of a metric space provides a very nice
illustration of some of the theorems on complete and compact metric spaces just presented.
Definition 37.40. Given a metric space, (X, d), for any subset, A ⊆ X, for any,  ≥ 0,
define the  -hull of A as the set
V (A) = {x ∈ X, ∃a ∈ A | d(a, x) ≤  }.
See Figure 37.46. Given any two nonempty bounded subsets, A, B of X, define D(A, B), the
Hausdorff distance between A and B, by
D(A, B) = inf{ ≥ 0 | A ⊆ V (B) and B ⊆ V (A)}.

V (A) є

Note that since we are considering nonempty bounded subsets, D(A, B) is well defined
(i.e., not infinite). However, D is not necessarily a distance function. It is a distance function
if we restrict our attention to nonempty compact subsets of X (actually, it is also a metric on
closed and bounded subsets). We let K(X) denote the set of all nonempty compact subsets
of X. The remarkable fact is that D is a distance on K(X) and that if X is complete or
compact, then so is K(X). The following theorem is taken from Edgar [55].
37.10. THE CONTRACTION MAPPING THEOREM 1385
Theorem 37.55. If (X, d) is a metric space, then the Hausdorff distance, D, on the set,
K(X), of nonempty compact subsets of X is a distance. If (X, d) is complete, then (K(X), D)
is complete and if (X, d) is compact, then (K(X), D) is compact.
Proof. Since (nonempty) compact sets are bounded, D(A, B) is well defined. Clearly D is
symmetric. Assume that D(A, B) = 0. Then for every  > 0, A ⊆ V (B), which means
that for every a ∈ A, there is some b ∈ B such that d(a, b) ≤  , and thus, that A ⊆ B.
Since Proposition 37.26 implies that B is closed, B = B, and we have A ⊆ B. Similarly,
B ⊆ A, and thus, A = B. Clearly, if A = B, we have D(A, B) = 0. It remains to prove
the triangle inequality. Assume that D(A, B) ≤  1 and that D(B, C) ≤  2. We must show
that D(A, C) ≤  1 +  2. This will be accomplished if we can show that C ⊆ V 1+ 2
(A) and
A ⊆ V 1+ 2
(C). By assumption and definition of D, B ⊆ V 1
(A) and C ⊆ V 2
(B). Then
V 2
(B) ⊆ V 2
(V 1
(A)),
and since a basic application of the triangle inequality implies that
V 2
(V 1
(A)) ⊆ V 1+ 2
(A),
we get
C ⊆ V 2
(B) ⊆ V 1+ 2
(A).

A ⊆ V 1

Hence
A ⊆ V 1
(B) ⊆ V 1
(V 2
(C)) ⊆ V 1+ 2
(C),
and thus the triangle inequality follows.
Next we need to prove that if (X, d) is complete, then (K(X), D) is also complete. First
we show that if (An) is a sequence of nonempty compact sets converging to a nonempty
compact set A in the Hausdorff metric, then
A = {x ∈ X | there is a sequence, (xn), with xn ∈ An converging to x}.
Indeed, if (xn) is a sequence with xn ∈ An converging to x and (An) converges to A then,
for every  > 0, there is some xn such that d(xn, x) ≤ /2 and there is some an ∈ A such
that d(an, xn) ≤ /2 and thus, d(an, x) ≤  , which shows that x ∈ A. Since A is compact, it
is closed, and x ∈ A. See Figure 37.48.

yellow parallelogram. Figure (ii.) expands the dashed region and shows why d(an, x) < .
Conversely, since (An) converges to A, for every x ∈ A, for every n ≥ 1, there is some
xn ∈ An such that d(xn, x) ≤ 1/n and the sequence (xn) converges to x.
Now let (An) be a Cauchy sequence in K(X). It can be proven that (An) converges to
the set
A = {x ∈ X | there is a sequence, (xn), with xn ∈ An converging to x},
and that A is nonempty and compact. To prove that A is compact, one proves that it is
totally bounded and complete. Details are given in Edgar [55].
37.11. CONTINUOUS LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR MAPS 1387
Finally we need to prove that if (X, d) is compact, then (K(X), D) is compact. Since we
already know that (K(X), D) is complete if (X, d) is, it is enough to prove that (K(X), D)
is totally bounded if (X, d) is, which is not hard.
In view of Theorem 37.55 and Theorem 37.54, it is possible to define some nonempty
compact subsets of X in terms of fixed points of contraction maps. This can be done in
terms of iterated function systems, yielding a large class of fractals. However, we will omit
this topic and instead refer the reader to Edgar [55].
In Chapter 38 we show how certain fractals can be defined by iterated function systems,
using Theorem 37.55 and Theorem 37.54.
Before considering differentials, we need to look at the continuity of linear maps.
37.11 Continuous Linear and Multilinear Maps
If E and F are normed vector spaces, we first characterize when a linear map f : E → F is
continuous.
Proposition 37.56. Given two normed vector spaces E and F, for any linear map f : E →
F, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The function f is continuous at 0.
(2) There is a constant k ≥ 0 such that,
k
f(u)k ≤ k, for every u ∈ E such that k uk ≤ 1.
(3) There is a constant k ≥ 0 such that,
k
f(u)k ≤ kk uk , for every u ∈ E.
(4) The function f is continuous at every point of E.
Proof. Assume (1). Then for every  > 0, there is some η > 0 such that, for every u ∈ E, if
k
uk ≤ η, then k f(u)k ≤  . Pick  = 1, so that there is some η > 0 such that, if k uk ≤ η, then
k
f(u)k ≤ 1. If k uk ≤ 1, then k ηuk ≤ ηk uk ≤ η, and so, k f(ηu)k ≤ 1, that is, ηk f(u)k ≤ 1,
which implies k f(u)k ≤ η
−1
. Thus, (2) holds with k = η
−1
.
Assume that (2) holds. If u = 0, then by linearity, f(0) = 0, and thus k f(0)k ≤ kk 0k
holds trivially for all k ≥ 0. If u 6 = 0, then k uk > 0, and since

1388 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
we have




f

k

≤ k,
which implies that
k
f(u)k ≤ kk uk .
Thus, (3) holds.
If (3) holds, then for all u, v ∈ E, we have
k
f(v) − f(u)k = k f(v − u)k ≤ kk v − uk .
If k = 0, then f is the zero function, and continuity is obvious. Otherwise, if k > 0, for every
 > 0, if k v − uk ≤  k
, then k f(v − u)k ≤  , which shows continuity at every u ∈ E. Finally,
it is obvious that (4) implies (1).
Among other things, Proposition 37.56 shows that a linear map is continuous iff the image
of the unit (closed) ball is bounded. Since a continuous linear map satisfies the condition
k
f(u)k ≤ kk uk (for some k ≥ 0), it is also uniformly continuous.
If E and F are normed vector spaces, the set of all continuous linear maps f : E → F is
denoted by L(E; F).
Using Proposition 37.56, we can define a norm on L(E; F) which makes it into a normed
vector space. This definition has already been given in Chapter 9 (Definition 9.7) but for
the reader’s convenience, we repeat it here.
Definition 37.41. Given two normed vector spaces E and F, for every continuous linear
map f : E → F, we define the operator norm k fk of f as
k
fk = inf {k ≥ 0 | kf(x)k ≤ kk xk , for all x ∈ E} = sup {kf(x)k | kxk ≤ 1} .
From Definition 37.41, for every continuous linear map f ∈ L(E; F), we have
k
f(x)k ≤ kfkk xk ,
for every x ∈ E. It is easy to verify that L(E; F) is a normed vector space under the norm
of Definition 37.41. Furthermore, if E, F, G, are normed vector spaces, and f : E → F and
g : F → G are continuous linear maps, we have
k
g ◦ fk ≤ kgkk fk .
We can now show that when E = R
n or E = C
n
, with any of the norms k k 1, k k 2, or
k k
∞, then every linear map f : E → F is continuous.
Proposition 37.57. If E = R
n or E = C
n
, with any of the norms k k 1, k k 2, or k k ∞, and
F is any normed vector space, then every linear map f : E → F is continuous.
37.11. CONTINUOUS LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR MAPS 1389
Proof. Let (e1, . . . , en) be the standard basis of R
n
(a similar proof applies to C
n
). In view
of Proposition 9.3, it is enough to prove the proposition for the norm
k
xk ∞ = max{|xi

We have,
k
f(v) − f(u)k = k f(v − u)k =

By the argument used in Proposition 37.56 to prove that (3) implies (4), f is continuous.
Actually, we proved in Theorem 9.5 that if E is a vector space of finite dimension, then
any two norms are equivalent, so that they define the same topology. This fact together with
Proposition 37.57 prove the following:
Theorem 37.58. If E is a vector space of finite dimension (over R or C), then all norms
are equivalent (define the same topology). Furthermore, for any normed vector space F,
every linear map f : E → F is continuous.

If
continuous. As an example, let
E is a normed vector space of infinite dimension, a linear map
E be the infinite vector space of all polynomials over
f : E → F may not be
R.
Let
k
P(X)k = max
0≤x≤1
|P(x)|.
We leave as an exercise to show that this is indeed a norm. Let F = R, and let f : E → F
be the map defined such that, f(P(X)) = P(3). It is clear that f is linear. Consider the
sequence of polynomials
Pn(X) =  X

.
It is clear that k Pnk =

, and thus, the sequence Pn has the null polynomial as a limit.
However, we have
f(Pn(X)) = Pn(3) =  3

n
,
and the sequence f(Pn(X)) diverges to +∞. Consequently, in view of Proposition 37.15 (1),
f is not continuous.
1390 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
We now consider the continuity of multilinear maps. We treat explicitly bilinear maps,
the general case being a straightforward extension.
Proposition 37.59. Given normed vector spaces E, F and G, for any bilinear map f : E ×
F → G, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The function f is continuous at h 0, 0i .
2) There is a constant k ≥ 0 such that,
k
f(u, v)k ≤ k, for all u ∈ E, v ∈ F such that k uk , k vk ≤ 1.
3) There is a constant k ≥ 0 such that,
k
f(u, v)k ≤ kk ukk vk , for all u ∈ E, v ∈ F .
4) The function f is continuous at every point of E × F.
Proof. It is similar to that of Proposition 37.56, with a small subtlety in proving that (3)
implies (4), namely that two different η’s that are not independent are needed.
In contrast to continuous linear maps, which must be uniformly continuous, nonzero
continuous bilinear maps are not uniformly continuous. Let f : E × F → G be a continuous
bilinear map such that f(a, b) 6 = 0 for some a ∈ E and some b ∈ F. Consider the sequences
(un) and (vn) (with n ≥ 1) given by
un = (xn, yn) = (na, nb)
vn = (x

Obviously

so limn7→∞ k vn − unk = 0. On the other hand
f(x

f(a, b),
and thus limn7→∞ k f(x

, yn
0
) − f(xn, yn)k = 2 k f(a, b)k 6 = 0, which shows that f is not uni￾formly continuous, because if this was the case, this limit would be zero.
If E, F, and G, are normed vector spaces, we denote the set of all continuous bilinear
maps f : E × F → G by L2(E, F; G). Using Proposition 37.59, we can define a norm on
L2(E, F; G) which makes it into a normed vector space.
37.11. CONTINUOUS LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR MAPS 1391
Definition 37.42. Given normed vector spaces E, F, and G, for every continuous bilinear
map f : E × F → G, we define the norm k fk of f as
k
fk = inf {k ≥ 0 | kf(x, y)k ≤ kk xkk yk , for all x ∈ E, y ∈ F}
= sup {kf(x, y)k | kxk , k yk ≤ 1} .
From Definition 37.41, for every continuous bilinear map f ∈ L2(E, F; G), we have
k
f(x, y)k ≤ kfkk xkk yk ,
for all x, y ∈ E. It is easy to verify that L2(E, F; G) is a normed vector space under the
norm of Definition 37.42.
Given a bilinear map f : E × F → G, for every u ∈ E, we obtain a linear map denoted
fu: F → G, defined such that, fu(v) = f(u, v). Furthermore, since
k
f(x, y)k ≤ kfkk xkk yk ,
it is clear that fu is continuous. We can then consider the map ϕ: E → L(F; G), defined
such that, ϕ(u) = fu, for any u ∈ E, or equivalently, such that,
ϕ(u)(v) = f(u, v).
Actually, it is easy to show that ϕ is linear and continuous, and that k ϕk = k fk . Thus, f 7→ ϕ
defines a map from L2(E, F; G) to L(E;L(F; G)). We can also go back from L(E;L(F; G))
to L2(E, F; G). We summarize all this in the following proposition.
Proposition 37.60. Let E, F, G be three normed vector spaces. The map f 7→ ϕ, from
L2(E, F; G) to L(E;L(F; G)), defined such that, for every f ∈ L2(E, F; G),
ϕ(u)(v) = f(u, v),
is an isomorphism of vector spaces, and furthermore, k ϕk = k fk .
As a corollary of Proposition 37.60, we get the following proposition which will be useful
when we define second-order derivatives.
Proposition 37.61. Let E, F be normed vector spaces. The map app from L(E; F) × E to
F, defined such that, for every f ∈ L(E; F), for every u ∈ E,
app(f, u) = f(u),
is a continuous bilinear map.
1392 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Remark: If E and F are nontrivial, it can be shown that k appk = 1. It can also be shown
that composition
◦: L(E; F) × L(F; G) → L(E; G),
is bilinear and continuous.
The above propositions and definition generalize to arbitrary n-multilinear maps, with
n ≥ 2. Proposition 37.59 extends in the obvious way to any n-multilinear map f : E1 × · · · ×
En → F, but condition (3) becomes:
There is a constant k ≥ 0 such that,
k
f(u1, . . . , un)k ≤ kk u1k · · · kunk , for all u1 ∈ E1, . . . , un ∈ En.
Definition 37.42 also extends easily to
k
fk = inf {k ≥ 0 | kf(x1, . . . , xn)k ≤ kk x1k · · · kxnk , for all xi ∈ Ei
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
= sup {kf(x1, . . . , xn)k | kxnk , . . . , k xnk ≤ 1} .
Proposition 37.60 is also easily extended, and we get an isomorphism between continuous
n-multilinear maps in Ln(E1, . . . , En; F), and continuous linear maps in
L(E1;L(E2; . . . ;L(En; F)))
An obvious extension of Proposition 37.61 also holds.
Definition 37.43. A normed vector space (E, k k ) over R (or C) which is a complete metric
space for the distance d(u, v) = k v − uk , is called a Banach space.
The following theorem is a key result of the theory of Banach spaces worth proving.
Theorem 37.62. If E and F are normed vector spaces, and if F is a Banach space, then
L(E; F) is a Banach space (with the operator norm).
Proof. Let (f)n≥1 be a Cauchy sequence of continuous linear maps fn : E → F. We proceed
in several steps.
Step 1. Define the pointwise limit f : E → F of the sequence (fn)n≥1.
Since (f)n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence, for every  > 0, there is some N > 0 such that
k
fm − fnk <  for all m, n ≥ N. Since k k is the operator norm, we deduce that for any
u ∈ E, we have
k
fm(u) − fn(u)k = k (fm − fn)(u)k ≤ kfm − fnk k uk ≤  k uk for all m, n ≥ N,
that is,
k
fm(u) − fn(u)k ≤  k uk for all m, n ≥ N. (∗1)
37.11. CONTINUOUS LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR MAPS 1393
If u = 0, then fm(0) = fn(0) = 0 for all m, n, so the sequence (fn(0)) is a Cauchy sequence
in F converging to 0. If u 6 = 0, by replacing  by / k uk , we see that the sequence (fn(u))
is a Cauchy sequence in F. Since F is complete, the sequence (fn(u)) has a limit which we
denote by f(u). This defines our candidate limit function f by
f(u) = limn7→∞
fn(u).
It remains to prove that
1. f is linear.
2. f is continous.
3. f is the limit of (fn) for the operator norm.
Step 2. The function f is linear.
Recall that in a normed vector space, addition and multiplication by a fixed scalar are
continuous (since k u + vk ≤ kuk + k vk and k λuk ≤ |λ| kuk ). Thus by definition of f and
since the fn are linear we have
f(u + v) = limn7→∞
fn(u + v) by definition of f
= limn7→∞
(fn(u) + fn(v)) by linearity of fn
= limn7→∞
fn(u) + limn7→∞
fn(v) since + is continuous
= f(u) + f(v) by definition of f.
Similarly,
f(λu) = limn7→∞
fn(λu) by definition of f
= limn7→∞
λfn(u) by linearity of fn
= λ limn7→∞
fn(u) by continuity of scalar multiplication
= λf(u) by definition of f.
Therefore, f is linear.
Step 3. The function f is continuous.
Since (fn)n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence, for every  > 0, there is some N > 0 such that
which implies that
k
fm − fnk <  for all m, n ≥ N. Since fm = fn + fm − fn, we get k fmk ≤ kfnk + k fm − fnk ,
k
fmk ≤ kfnk +  for all m, n ≥ N. (∗2)
1394 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Using (∗2), we also have
k
fm(u)k ≤ kfmk k uk ≤ (k fnk +  ) k uk for all m, n ≥ N,
that is,
k
fm(u)k ≤ (k fnk +  ) k uk for all m, n ≥ N. (∗3)
Hold n ≥ N fixed and let m tend to +∞ in (∗3). Since the norm is continuous, we get
k
f(u)k ≤ (k fnk +  ) k uk ,
which shows that f is continuous.
Step 4. The function f is the limit of (fn) for the operator norm.
Recall (∗1):
k
fm(u) − fn(u)k ≤  k uk for all m, n ≥ N. (∗1)
Hold n ≥ N fixed but this time let m tend to +∞ in (∗1). By continuity of the norm we get
k
f(u) − fn(u)k = k (f − fn)(u)k ≤  k uk .
By definition of the operator norm,
k
f − fnk = sup{k(f − fn)(u)k | kuk = 1} ≤  for all n ≥ N,
which proves that fn converges to f for the operator norm.
As a special case of Theorem 37.62, if we let F = R (or F = C in the case of complex
vector spaces) we see that E
0 = L(E; R) (or E
0 = L(E; C)) is complete (since R and C are
complete). The space E
0 of continuous linear forms on E is called the dual of E. It is a
subspace of the algebraic dual E
∗ of E which consists of all linear forms on E, not necessarily
continuous.
It can also be shown that if E, F and G are normed vector spaces, and if G is a Banach
space, then L2(E, F; G) is a Banach space. The proof is essentially identical.
37.12 Completion of a Normed Vector Space
An easy corollary of Theorem 37.53 and Theorem 37.52 is that every normed vector space
can be embedded in a complete normed vector space, that is, a Banach space.
Theorem 37.63. If (E, k k ) is a normed vector space, then its completion (E, b db) as a metric
space (where E is given the metric d(x, y) = k x − yk ) can be given a unique vector space
structure extending the vector space structure on E, and a norm k k Eb
, so that ( bE, k k Eb
) is a
Banach space, and the metric b d is associated with the norm k k Eb
. Furthermore, the isometry
ϕ: E → Eb is a linear isometry.
37.12. COMPLETION OF A NORMED VECTOR SPACE 1395
Proof. The addition operation +: E × E → E is uniformly continuous because
k
(u
0 + v
0 ) − (u
00 + v
00 )k ≤ ku
0 − u
00 k + k v
0 − v
00 k .
It is not hard to show that b E × b E is a complete metric space and that E × E is dense
in b E × b E. Then, by Theorem 37.52, the uniformly continuous function + has a unique
continuous extension +: b E × b E → b E.
The map ·: R × E → E is not uniformly continuous, but for any fixed λ ∈ R, the
map Lλ : E → E given by Lλ(u) = λ · u is uniformly continuous, so by Theorem 37.52 the
function Lλ has a unique continuous extension Lλ : b E → b E, which we use to define the scalar
multiplication ·: R × b E → b E. It is easily checked that with the above addition and scalar
multiplication, Eb is a vector space.
Since the norm k k on E is uniformly continuous, it has a unique continuous extension
k k
Eb
: Eb → R+. The identities k u + vk ≤ kuk + k vk and k λuk ≤ |λ| kuk extend to Eb by
continuity. The equation
d(u, v) = k u − vk
also extends to Eb by continuity and yields
b
d(α, β) = k α − βk Eb
,
which shows that k k Eb
is indeed a norm, and that the metric b d is associated to it. Finally, it
is easy to verify that the map ϕ is linear. The uniqueness of the structure of normed vector
space follows from the uniqueness of continuous extensions in Theorem 37.52.
Theorem 37.63 and Theorem 37.52 will be used to show that every Hermitian space can
be embedded in a Hilbert space.
The following version of Theorem 37.52 for normed vector spaces is needed in the theory
of integration.
Theorem 37.64. Let E and F be two normed vector spaces, let E0 be a dense subspace of
E, and let f0 : E0 → F be a continuous function. If f0 is uniformly continuous and if F
is complete, then there is a unique uniformly continuous function f : E → F extending f0.
Furthermore, if f0 is a continuous linear map, then f is also a linear continuous map, and
k
fk = k f0k .
Proof. We only need to prove the second statement. Given any two vectors x, y ∈ E, since
E0 is dense on E we can pick sequences (xn) and (yn) of vectors xn, yn ∈ E0 such that
x = limn7→∞ xn and y = limn7→∞ yn. Since addition and scalar multiplication are continuous,
we get
x + y = limn7→∞
(xn + yn)
λx = limn7→∞
(λxn)
1396 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
for any λ ∈ R (or λ ∈ C). Since f(x) is defined by
f(x) = limn7→∞
f0(xn)
independently of the sequence (xn) converging to x, and similarly for f(y) and f(x + y),
since f0 is linear, we have
f(x + y) = limn7→∞
f0(xn + yn)
= limn7→∞
(f0(xn) + f0(yn))
= limn7→∞
f0(xn) + limn7→∞
f0(yn)
= f(x) + f(y).
Similarly,
f(λx) = limn7→∞
f0(λxn)
= limn7→∞
λf0(xn)
= λ limn7→∞
f0(xn)
= λf(x).
Therefore, f is linear. Since the norm is continuous, we have
k
f(x)k =

  limn7→∞
f0(xn)

 = limn7→∞
k
f0(xn)k ,
and since f0 is continuous
k
f0(xn)k ≤ kf0k k xnk for all n ≥ 1,
so we get
limn7→∞
k
f0(xn)k ≤ limn7→∞
k
f0k k xnk for all n ≥ 1,
that is,
k
f(x)k ≤ kf0k k xk .
Since
k
fk = sup
k
xk =1, x∈E
k
f(x)k ,
we deduce that k fk ≤ kf0k . But since E0 ⊆ E and f agrees with f0 on E0, we also have
k
f0k = sup
k
xk =1, x∈E0
k
f0(x)k = sup
k
xk =1, x∈E0
k
f(x)k ≤ sup
k
xk =1, x∈E
k
f(x)k = k fk ,
and thus k fk = k f0k .
Finally, we consider normed affine spaces.
37.13. NORMED AFFINE SPACES 1397
37.13 Normed Affine Spaces
For geometric applications, we will need to consider affine spaces (E,
−→E ) where the associated
space of translations −→E is a vector space equipped with a norm.
Definition 37.44. Given an affine space (E,
−→E ), where the space of translations −→E is a
vector space over R or C, we say that (E,
−→E ) is a normed affine space if −→E is a normed
vector space with norm k k .
Given a normed affine space, there is a natural metric on E itself, defined such that
d(a, b) = k −→abk .
Observe that this metric is invariant under translation, that is,
d(a + u, b + u) = d(a, b).
Also, for every fixed a ∈ E and λ > 0, if we consider the map h: E → E, defined such that,
h(x) = a + λ
−→ax,
then d(h(x), h(y)) = λd(x, y).
Note that the map (a, b) 7→
−→ab from E ×E to
−→E is continuous, and similarly for the map
a 7→ a + u from E ×
−→E to E. In fact, the map u 7→ a + u is a homeomorphism from −→E to
Ea.
Of course, R
n
is a normed affine space under the Euclidean metric, and it is also complete.
If an affine space E is a finite direct sum (E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (Em, am), and each Ei
is also a
normed affine space with norm k k i
, we make (E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (Em, am) into a normed affine
space, by giving it the norm
k
(x1, . . . , xn)k = max(k x1k 1, . . . , k xnk n).
Similarly, the finite product E1 × · · · × Em is made into a normed affine space, under the
same norm.
We are now ready to define the derivative (or differential) of a map between two normed
affine spaces. This will lead to tangent spaces to curves and surfaces (in normed affine
spaces).

A Detour On Fractals
38.1 Iterated Function Systems and Fractals
A pleasant application of the Hausdorff distance and of the fixed point theorem for contract￾ing mappings is a method for defining a class of “self-similar” fractals. For this, we can use
iterated function systems.
Definition 38.1. Given a metric space, (X, d), an iterated function system, for short, an
ifs, is a finite sequence of functions, (f1, . . . , fn), where each fi
: X → X is a contracting
mapping. A nonempty compact subset, K, of X is an invariant set (or attractor) for the ifs,
(f1, . . . , fn), if
K = f1(K) ∪ · · · ∪ fn(K).
The major result about ifs’s is the following:
Theorem 38.1. If (X, d) is a nonempty complete metric space, then every iterated function
system, (f1, . . . , fn), has a unique invariant set, A, which is a nonempty compact subset of
X. Furthermore, for every nonempty compact subset, A0, of X, this invariant set, A, if the
limit of the sequence, (Am), where Am+1 = f1(Am) ∪ · · · ∪ fn(Am).
Proof. Since X is complete, by Theorem 37.55, the space (K(X), D) is a complete metric
space. The theorem will follow from Theorem 37.54 if we can show that the map,
F : K(X) → K(X), defined such that
F(K) = f1(K) ∪ · · · ∪ fn(K),
for every nonempty compact set, K, is a contracting mapping. Let A, B be any two nonempty
compact subsets of X and consider any η ≥ D(A, B). Since each fi
: X → X is a contracting
mapping, there is some λi
, with 0 ≤ λi < 1, such that
d(fi(a), fi(b)) ≤ λid(a, b),
1399
1400 CHAPTER 38. A DETOUR ON FRACTALS
for all a, b ∈ X. Let λ = max{λ1, . . . , λn}. We claim that
D(F(A), F(B)) ≤ λD(A, B).
For any x ∈ F(A) = f1(A)∪ · · · ∪fn(A), there is some ai ∈ Ai such that x = fi(ai) and since
η ≥ D(A, B), there is some bi ∈ B such that
d(ai
, bi) ≤ η,
and thus,
d(x, fi(bi)) = d(fi(ai), fi(bi)) ≤ λid(ai
, bi) ≤ λη.
This show that
F(A) ⊆ Vλη(F(B)).
Similarly, we can prove that
F(B) ⊆ Vλη(F(A)),
and since this holds for all η ≥ D(A, B), we proved that
D(F(A), F(B)) ≤ λD(A, B)
where λ = max{λ1, . . . , λn}. Since 0 ≤ λi < 1, we have 0 ≤ λ < 1 and F is indeed a
contracting mapping.
Theorem 38.1 justifies the existence of many familiar “self-similar” fractals. One of the
best known fractals is the Sierpinski gasket.
Example 38.1. Consider an equilateral triangle with vertices a, b, c, and let f1, f2, f3 be
the dilatations of centers a, b, c and ratio 1/2. The Sierpinski gasket is the invariant set of
the ifs (f1, f2, f3). The dilations f1, f2, f3 can be defined explicitly as follows, assuming that
a = (−1/2, 0), b = (1/2, 0), and c = (0,
√
3/2). The contractions f1, f2, f3 are specified by

38.1. ITERATED FUNCTION SYSTEMS AND FRACTALS 1401
Figure 38.1: The Sierpinski gasket
We wrote a Mathematica program that iterates any finite number of affine maps on any
input figure consisting of combinations of points, line segments, and polygons (with their
interior points). Starting with the edges of the triangle a, b, c, after 6 iterations, we get the
picture shown in Figure 38.1.
It is amusing that the same fractal is obtained no matter what the initial nonempty
compact figure is. It is interesting to see what happens if we start with a solid triangle (with
its interior points). The result after 6 iterations is shown in Figure 38.2. The convergence
towards the Sierpinski gasket is very fast. Incidently, there are many other ways of defining
the Sierpinski gasket.
A nice variation on the theme of the Sierpinski gasket is the Sierpinski dragon.

The result of 7 iterations starting from the line segment (−1, 0),(1, 0)), is shown in Figure
38.3. This curve converges to the boundary of the Sierpinski gasket.
A different kind of fractal is the Heighway dragon.
Example 38.3. The Heighway dragon is specified by the following two contractions:

It can be shown that for any number of iterations, the polygon does not cross itself. This
means that no edge is traversed twice and that if a point is traversed twice, then this point
is the endpoint of some edge. The result of 13 iterations, starting with the line segment
((0, 0),(0, 1)), is shown in Figure 38.4.
The Heighway dragon turns out to fill a closed and bounded set. It can also be shown
that the plane can be tiled with copies of the Heighway dragon.
Another well known example is the Koch curve.
