However, this expression does not make sense! Indeed, a vector in an intrinsic quantity that
does not depend on a specific basis. What makes sense is that the coordinates of a vector
vary in a contravariant fashion.
Let us consider some concrete examples of change of bases.

4.4 The Effect of a Change of Bases on Matrices
The effect of a change of bases on the representation of a linear map is described in the
following proposition.
Proposition 4.5. Let E and F be vector spaces, let U = (u1, . . . , un) and U
0 = (u
01
, . . . , u0n
)
be two bases of E, and let V = (v1, . . . , vm) and V
0 = (v1
0
, . . . , vm
0) be two bases of F. Let
P = PU0 ,U be the change of basis matrix from U to U
0 , and let Q = PV0 ,V be the change of
basis matrix from V to V
0 . For any linear map f : E → F, let M(f) = MU,V(f) be the matrix
associated to f w.r.t. the bases U and V, and let M0 (f) = MU0 ,V0 (f) be the matrix associated
to f w.r.t. the bases U
0 and V
0 . We have
M0 (f) = Q
−1M(f)P,
or more explicitly
MU0 ,V0 (f) = P
−1
V0 ,VMU,V(f)PU0 ,U = PV,V0 MU,V(f)PU0 ,U.
Proof. Since f : E → F can be written as f = idF ◦ f ◦ idE, since P = PU0 ,U is the matrix of
idE w.r.t. the bases (u
01
, . . . , u0n
) and (u1, . . . , un), and Q−1 = P
−1
V0 ,V = PV,V0 is the matrix of
idF w.r.t. the bases (v1, . . . , vm) and (v1
0
, . . . , vm
0) as illustrated by the following diagram

by Proposition 4.2, we have M0 (f) = Q−1M(f)P.
As a corollary, we get the following result.
Corollary 4.6. Let E be a vector space, and let U = (u1, . . . , un) and U
0 = (u
01
, . . . , u0n
) be
two bases of E. Let P = PU0 ,U be the change of basis matrix from U to U
0 . For any linear
map f : E → E, let M(f) = MU(f) be the matrix associated to f w.r.t. the basis U, and let
M0 (f) = MU0 (f) be the matrix associated to f w.r.t. the basis U
0 . We have
M0 (f) = P
−1M(f)P,
or more explicitly,
MU0 (f) = P

, U = (e1, e2) where e1 = (1, 0) and e2 = (0, 1) are the canonical
basis vectors, let V = (v1, v2) = (e1, e1 − e2), and let
A =

The change of basis matrix P = PV,U from U to V is
P =

1 1
0 −1

,
and we check that
P
−1 = P.
Therefore, in the basis V, the matrix representing the linear map f defined by A is
A
0 = P
−1AP = P AP =

a diagonal matrix. In the basis V, it is clear what the action of f is: it is a stretch by a
factor of 2 in the v1 direction and it is the identity in the v2 direction. Observe that v1 and
v2 are not orthogonal.
What happened is that we diagonalized the matrix A. The diagonal entries 2 and 1 are
the eigenvalues of A (and f), and v1 and v2 are corresponding eigenvectors. We will come
back to eigenvalues and eigenvectors later on.
The above example showed that the same linear map can be represented by different
matrices. This suggests making the following definition:
Definition 4.5. Two n×n matrices A and B are said to be similar iff there is some invertible
matrix P such that
B = P
−1AP.
It is easily checked that similarity is an equivalence relation. From our previous consid￾erations, two n × n matrices A and B are similar iff they represent the same linear map
with respect to two different bases. The following surprising fact can be shown: Every square

matrix A is similar to its transpose A> . The proof requires advanced concepts (the Jordan
form or similarity invariants).
If U = (u1, . . . , un) and V = (v1, . . . , vn) are two bases of E, the change of basis matrix
P = PV,U =

.
Such a definition is needed since scalar multiplication of a vector by a scalar is only defined
if the scalar is on the left of the vector, but in the matrix expression (∗) above, the vectors
are on the left of the scalars!
Even though matrices are indispensable since they are the major tool in applications of
linear algebra, one should not lose track of the fact that
linear maps are more fundamental because they are intrinsic
objects that do not depend on the choice of bases.
Consequently, we advise the reader to try to think in terms of
linear maps rather than reduce everything to matrices.
In our experience, this is particularly effective when it comes to proving results about
linear maps and matrices, where proofs involving linear maps are often more “conceptual.”
These proofs are usually more general because they do not depend on the fact that the
dimension is finite. Also, instead of thinking of a matrix decomposition as a purely algebraic
operation, it is often illuminating to view it as a geometric decomposition. This is the case of
the SVD, which in geometric terms says that every linear map can be factored as a rotation,
followed by a rescaling along orthogonal axes and then another rotation.
After all,
a matrix is a representation of a linear map,
and most decompositions of a matrix reflect the fact that with a suitable choice of a basis
(or bases), the linear map is a represented by a matrix having a special shape. The problem
is then to find such bases.
Still, for the beginner, matrices have a certain irresistible appeal, and we confess that
it takes a certain amount of practice to reach the point where it becomes more natural to
deal with linear maps. We still recommend it! For example, try to translate a result stated
in terms of matrices into a result stated in terms of linear maps. Whenever we tried this
exercise, we learned something.
Also, always try to keep in mind that
linear maps are geometric in nature; they act on space.
