Figure 26.20: Pappus’s theorem (projective version).
a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c0 are distinct from the intersection of D and D0 , then the intersection points
p = h b, c0 i ∩ hb
0 , ci , q = h a, c0 i ∩ ha
0 , ci , and r = h a, b0 i ∩ ha
0 , bi are collinear.
Proof. First, since any two lines in a projective plane intersect in a single point, the points
p, q, r are well defined. Choose ∆ = h p, ri as the line at infinity, and consider the affine plane
X = P(E) − ∆. Since h a, b0 i and h a
0 , bi intersect at a point at infinity r on ∆, h a, b0 i and
h
a
0 , bi are parallel, and similarly h b, c0 i and h b
0 , ci are parallel. Thus, by the affine version of
Pappus’s theorem (Proposition 24.12), the lines h a, c0 i and h a
0 , ci are parallel, which means
that their intersection q is on the line at infinity ∆ = h p, ri , which means that p, q, r are
collinear.
By working in the projective completion of an affine plane, we can obtain an improved
version of Pappus’s theorem for affine planes. The reader will have to figure out how to deal
with the special cases where some of p, q, r go to infinity.
Now, we prove a projective version of Desargues’s theorem slightly more general than
that given in Proposition 26.7. It is interesting that the proof is radically different, depend￾ing on the dimension of the projective space P(E). This is not surprising. In axiomatic
presentations of projective plane geometry, Desargues’s theorem is independent of the other
axioms. Desargues’s theorem is illustrated in Figure 26.21.
Proposition 26.19. (Desargues) Let P(E) be a projective space. Given two triangles (a, b, c)
and (a
0 , b0 , c0 ), where the points a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c0 are pairwise distinct and the lines A = h b, ci ,
B = h a, ci , C = h a, bi , A0 = h b
0 , c0 i , B0 = h a
0 , c0 i , C
0 = h a
0 , b0 i are pairwise distinct, if the
26.9. MAKING GOOD USE OF HYPERPLANES AT INFINITY 911
lines h a, a0 i , h b, b0 i , and h c, c0 i intersect in a common point d distinct from a, b, c, a
0 , b0 , c0 ,
then the intersection points p = h b, ci ∩ hb
0 , c0 i , q = h a, ci ∩ ha
0 , c0 i , and r = h a, bi ∩ ha
0 , b0 i
belong to a common line distinct from A, B, C, A0 , B0 , C0 .
Proof. First, it is immediately shown that the line h p, qi is distinct from the lines A, B, C,
A0 , B0 , C0 . Let us assume that P(E) has dimension n ≥ 3. If the seven points d, a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c0
generate a projective subspace of dimension 3, then by Proposition 26.1, the intersection of
the two planes h a, b, ci and h a
0 , b0 , c0 i is a line, and thus p, q, r are collinear.
If P(E) has dimension n = 2 or the seven points d, a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c0 generate a projective
subspace of dimension 2, we use the following argument. In the projective plane X generated
by the seven points d, a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c0 , choose the projective line ∆ = h p, ri as the line at
infinity. Then in the affine plane Y = X − ∆, the lines h b, ci and h b
0 , c0 i are parallel, and the
lines h a, bi and h a
0 , b0 i are parallel, and the lines h a, a0 i , h b, b0 i , and h c, c0 i are either parallel or
concurrent. Then by the converse of the affine version of Desargues’s theorem (Proposition
24.13), the lines h a, ci and h a
0 , c0 i are parallel, which means that their intersection q belongs
to the line at infinity ∆ = h p, ri , and thus that p, q, r are collinear.

The converse of Desargues’s theorem also holds. Using the projective completion of an
affine space, it is easy to state an improved affine version of Desargues’s theorem. The
reader will have to figure out how to deal with the case where some of the points p, q, r go
912 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
to infinity. It can also be shown that Pappus’s theorem implies Desargues’s theorem. Many
results of projective or affine geometry can be obtained using the method of “sending points
to infinity.”
We now discuss briefly the notion of cross-ratio, since it is a major concept of projective
geometry.
26.10 The Cross-Ratio
Recall that affine maps preserve the ratio of three collinear points. In general, projective
maps do not preserve the ratio of three collinear points. However, bijective projective maps
preserve the “ratio of ratios” of any four collinear points (three of which are distinct). Such
ratios are called cross-ratios (in French, “birapport”). There are several ways of introducing
cross-ratios, but since we already have Proposition 26.5 at our disposal, we can circumvent
some of the tedious calculations needed if other approaches are chosen.
Given a field K, say K = R, recall that the projective line P
1
K consists of all equivalence
classes [x, y] of pairs (x, y) ∈ K2
such that (x, y) 6 = (0, 0), under the equivalence relation ∼
defined such that
(x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2) iff x2 = λx1 and y2 = λy1,
for some λ ∈ K−{0}. Letting ∞ = [1, 0], the projective line P
1
K is in bijection with K∪{∞}.
Furthermore, letting 0 = [0, 1] and 1 = [1, 1], the triple (∞, 0, 1) forms a projective frame
for P
1
K. Using this projective frame and Proposition 26.5, we define the cross-ratio of four
collinear points as follows.
Definition 26.8. Given a projective line ∆ = P(D) over a field K, for any sequence
(a, b, c, d) of four points in ∆, where a, b, c are distinct (i.e., (a, b, c) is a projective frame), the
cross-ratio [a, b, c, d] is defined as the element h(d) ∈ P
1
K, where h: ∆ → P
1
K is the unique
projectivity such that h(a) = ∞, h(b) = 0, and h(c) = 1 (which exists by Proposition 26.5,
since (a, b, c) is a projective frame for ∆ and (∞, 0, 1) is a projective frame for P
1
K). For any
projective space P(E) (of dimension ≥ 2) over a field K and any sequence (a, b, c, d) of four
collinear points in P(E), where a, b, c are distinct, the cross-ratio [a, b, c, d] is defined using
the projective line ∆ that the points a, b, c, d define. For any affine space E and any sequence
(a, b, c, d) of four collinear points in E, where a, b, c are distinct, the cross-ratio [a, b, c, d] is
defined by considering E as embedded in Ee.
It should be noted that the definition of the cross-ratio [a, b, c, d] depends on the order
of the points. Thus, there could be 24 = 4! different possible values depending on the
permutation of {a, b, c, d}. In fact, there are at most 6 distinct values. Also, note that
[a, b, c, d] = ∞ iff d = a, [a, b, c, d] = 0 iff d = b, and [a, b, c, d] = 1 iff d = c. Thus,
[a, b, c, d] ∈ K − {0, 1} iff d /∈ {a, b, c}.
26.10. THE CROSS-RATIO 913
The following proposition is almost obvious, but very important. It shows that projec￾tivities between projective lines are characterized by the preservation of the cross-ratio of
any four points (three of which are distinct).
Proposition 26.20. Given any two projective lines ∆ and ∆0 , for any sequence (a, b, c, d) of
points in ∆ and any sequence (a
0 , b0 , c0 , d0 ) of points in ∆0 , if a, b, c are distinct and a
0 , b0 , c0 are
distinct, there is a unique projectivity f : ∆ → ∆0 such that f(a) = a
0 , f(b) = b
0 , f(c) = c
0 ,
and f(d) = d
0 iff [a, b, c, d] = [a
0 , b0 , c0 , d0 ].
Proof. First, assume that f : ∆ → ∆0 is a projectivity such that f(a) = a
0 , f(b) = b
0 ,
f(c) = c
0 , and f(d) = d
0 . Let h: ∆ → P
1
K be the unique projectivity such that h(a) = ∞,
h(b) = 0, and h(c) = 1, and let h
0 : ∆0 → P
1
K be the unique projectivity such that h
0 (a
0 ) = ∞,
h
0 (b
0 ) = 0, and h
0 (c
0 ) = 1. By definition, [a, b, c, d] = h(d) and [a
0 , b0 , c0 , d0 ] = h
0 (d
0 ). However,
h
0 ◦f : ∆ → P
1
K is a projectivity such that (h
0 ◦f)(a) = ∞, (h
0 ◦f)(b) = 0, and (h
0 ◦f)(c) = 1,
and by the uniqueness of h, we get h = h
0 ◦ f. But then, [a, b, c, d] = h(d) = h
0 (f(d)) =
h
0 (d
0 ) = [a
0 , b0 , c0 , d0 ].
Conversely, assume that [a, b, c, d] = [a
0 , b0 , c0 , d0 ]. Since (a, b, c) and (a
0 , b
0 , c
0 ) are pro￾jective frames, by Proposition 26.5, there is a unique projectivity g : ∆ → ∆0 such that
g(a) = a
0 , g(b) = b
0 , and g(c) = c
0 . Now, h
0 ◦ g : ∆ → P
1
K is a projectivity such that
(h
0 ◦ g)(a) = ∞, (h
0 ◦ g)(b) = 0, and (h
0 ◦ g)(c) = 1, and thus, h = h
0 ◦ g. How￾ever, h
0 (d
0 ) = [a
0 , b0 , c0 , d0 ] = [a, b, c, d] = h(d) = h
0 (g(d)), and since h
0 is injective, we get
d
0 = g(d).
As a corollary of Proposition 26.20, given any three distinct points a, b, c on a projective
line ∆, for every λ ∈ P
1
K there is a unique point d ∈ ∆ such that [a, b, c, d] = λ.
In order to compute explicitly the cross-ratio, we show the following easy proposition.
Proposition 26.21. Given any projective line ∆ = P(D), for any three distinct points a, b, c
in ∆, if a = p(u), b = p(v), and c = p(u + v), where (u, v) is a basis of D, and for any
[λ, µ]∼ ∈ P
1
K and any point d ∈ ∆, we have
d = p(λu + µv) iff [a, b, c, d] = [λ, µ]∼.
Proof. If (e1, e2) is the basis of K2
such that e1 = (1, 0) and e2 = (0, 1), it is obvious that
p(e1) = ∞, p(e2) = 0, and p(e1 + e2) = 1. Let f : D → K2 be the bijective linear map such
that f(u) = e1 and f(v) = e2. Then f(u + v) = e1 + e2, and thus f induces the unique
projectivity P(f): P(D) → P
1
K such that P(f)(a) = ∞, P(f)(b) = 0, and P(f)(c) = 1.
Then
P(f)(p(λu + µv)) = [f(λu + µv)]∼ = [λe1 + µe2]∼ = [λ, µ]∼,
that is,
d = p(λu + µv) iff [a, b, c, d] = [λ, µ]∼,
as claimed.
914 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
We can now compute the cross-ratio explicitly for any given basis (u, v) of D. Assume
that a, b, c, d have homogeneous coordinates [λ1, µ1], [λ2, µ2], [λ3, µ3], and [λ4, µ4] over the
projective frame induced by (u, v). Letting wi = λiu + µiv, we have a = p(w1), b = p(w2),
c = p(w3), and d = p(w4). Since a and b are distinct, w1 and w2 are linearly independent,
and we can write w3 = αw1 + βw2 and w4 = γw1 + δw2, which can also be written as
w4 =
γ
α
α w1 +
δ
β
β w2,
and by Proposition 26.21, [a, b, c, d] =  γ/α, δ/β . However, since w1 and w2 are linearly
independent, it is possible to solve for α, β, γ, δ in terms of the homogeneous coordinates,
obtaining expressions involving determinants:
α =
det(w3, w2)
det(w1, w2)
, β =
det(w1, w3)
det(w1, w2)
,
γ =
det(w4, w2)
det(w1, w2)
, δ =
det(w1, w4)
det(w1, w2)
,
and thus, assuming that d 6 = a, we get
[a, b, c, d] =

.
When d = a, we have [a, b, c, d] = ∞. In particular, if ∆ is the projective completion of an
affine line D, then µi = 1, and we get
[a, b, c, d] = λ3 − λ1
λ3 − λ2

λ4 − λ1
λ4 − λ2

.
When d = ∞, we get
[a, b, c, ∞] =
−→ca
−→cb
,
which is just the usual ratio (although we defined it earlier as −ratio(a, c, b)).
We briefly mention some of the properties of the cross-ratio. For example, the cross￾ratio [a, b, c, d] is invariant if any two elements and the complementary two elements are
transposed, and letting 0−1 = ∞ and ∞−1 = 0, we have
[a, b, c, d] = [b, a, c, d]
−1 = [a, b, d, c]
−1
and
[a, b, c, d] = 1 − [a, c, b, d].
26.10. THE CROSS-RATIO 915
Since the permutations of {a, b, c, d} are generated by the above transpositions, the cross￾ratio takes at most six values. Letting λ = [a, b, c, d], if λ ∈ {∞, 0, 1}, then any permutation
of {a, b, c, d} yields a cross-ratio in {∞, 0, 1}, and if λ /∈ {∞, 0, 1}, then there are at most
the six values
λ, 1

It can be shown that the function
λ 7→ 256
(λ
2 − λ + 1)3
λ

(1 − λ)
2
takes a constant value on the six values listed above.
We also define when four points form a harmonic division. For this, we need to assume
that K is not of characteristic 2.
Definition 26.9. Given a projective line ∆, we say that a sequence of four collinear points
(a, b, c, d) in ∆ (where a, b, c are distinct) forms a harmonic division if [a, b, c, d] = −1. When
[a, b, c, d] = −1, we also say that c and d are harmonic conjugates of a and b.
If a, b, c are distinct collinear points in some affine space, from
[a, b, c, ∞] =
−→ca
−→cb
,
we note that c is the midpoint of (a, b) iff [a, b, c, ∞] = −1, that is, if (a, b, c, ∞) forms a
harmonic division. Figure 26.22 shows a harmonic division (a, b, c, d) on the real line, where
the coordinates of (a, b, c, d) are (−2, 2, 1, 4).

a + b = 2c.
916 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
There is a nice geometric interpretation of harmonic divisions in terms of quadrangles
(or complete quadrilaterals). Consider the quadrangle (projective frame) (a, b, c, d) in a
projective plane, and let a
0 be the intersection of h d, ai and h b, ci , b
0 be the intersection of
h
d, bi and h a, ci , and c
0 be the intersection of h d, ci and h a, bi . If we let g be the intersection
of h a, bi and h a
0 , b0 i , then it is an interesting exercise to show that (a, b, g, c0 ) is a harmonic
division. One way to prove this is to pick (a, c, b, d) as a projective frame and to compute
the coordinates of a
0 , b0 , c0 , and g. Then because h a, ci is the line at infinity, [a, b, g, c0 ] =
[∞, b, g, c0 ], which is computed using the above formula. Another way is to send some well
chosen points to infinity; see Berger [11] (Chapter 6, Section 6.4).

26.11 Fixed Points of Homographies and Homologies;
Homographies of RP1
and RP2
Let P(E) be a projective space where E is a vector space over some field K, and let h: P(E) →
P(E) be homography (or projectivity) of P(E) where h is given by the linear isomorphism
f : E → E so that h = P(f). Observe that if u ∈ E is an eigenvector of f for some eigenvalue
26.11. FIXED POINTS OF HOMOGRAPHIES AND HOMOLOGIES 917
λ ∈ K, then
h([u]) = [f(u)] = [λu] = [u]
since λ 6 = 0 because f is an isomorphism, which means that the point [u] ∈ P(E) is a fixed
pointh of h. In other words, eigenvectors of f induce fixed points of h = P(f).
Consequently, it makes sense to try to classify homographies in terms of their fixed points.
Of course this depends on the field K. If K is algebraically closed, for instance K = C, then
all the eigenvalues of f belong to K, and we can use the Jordan form of a matrix representing
f. If K = R, which is of particular interest to us, then we can use the real Jordan form,
and we can obtain a compete classification for E = R
2 and E = R
3
. We will also see that
special kinds of homographies that leave every point of some projective hyperplane P(H)
fixed, called homologies, play a special role.
We begin with the classification of the homographies of the real projective line RP1
. Since
a homography h of RP1
is represented by a real invertible 2 × 2 matrix
A =

a b
c d ,
and since A either 0, 1, or 2, real eigenvalues, the homography h has 0, 1, or 2 fixed points.
Definition 26.10. A homography of the real projective line RP1
not equal to the identity
is elliptic if is has no fixed point, parabolic if it has a single fixed point, or hyperbolic if it
has two fixed points.
(1) Elliptic homographies. In this case, (a + d)
2 − 4(ad − bc) < 0, so A has two distinct
complex conjugate eigenvalues α ± iβ, and in C
2
, they correspond to two complex
eigenvectors w1 = u + iv and w2 = u − iv, with u, v ∈ R
2
. Since
f(w1) = (α − iβ)w1
we obtain
f(u) + if(v) = αu + βv + i(−βu + αv),
which shows that in the basis (u, v), the homography h is represented by the matrix
Γ =  α
β α
−β

.

cos θ =

2
,
then
Γ = ρ

cos

θ −


which corresponds to a similarity. Observe that h is an involution, that is, h
2 = id iff
θ = π/2.
(2) Parabolic homographies. In this case, we must have (a + d)
2 − 4(ad − bc) = 0. The
matrix A is not diagonalizable and it has a Jordan form of the form
Γ =  λ
0 λ
1

.
In the affine line y = 1, a parabolic homography behaves like the translation by 1/λ.
(3) Hyperbolic homographies. In this case, (a + d)
2 − 4(ad − bc) > 0, so A has two distinct
nonzero reals eigenvalues λ and µ, and in a basis of eigenvectors it is represented by
the diagonal matrix
Γ =  λ
0 µ
0

.
If P and Q are the distinct fixed points of the the homography h, it is not hard to
show that for every M ∈ RP1
such that M 6 = P, Q, we have
[P, Q, M, h(M)] = k
where k = λ/µ. For example, see Sidler [161] (Chapter 3, Proposition 3.3.1), and
Berger [11] (Lemma 6.6.3). It can also be shown that h is an involution (h
2 = id) with
two distinct fixed points P and Q iff a + d = 0 iff k = −1 in the above equation; see
Sidler [161] (Chapter 3, Proposition 3.3.2), and Samuel [142] (Section 2.4).
We now classify the homographies of RP2
. Since the characteristic polynomial of a 3 × 3
real matrix A has degree 3 and since every real polynomial of degree 3 has at least one real
zero, A has some real eigenvalue. Since C is algebraically closed, every complex polynomial
of degree 3 has three zeros (counted with multiplicity), in which case, all three eigenvalues
of a 3 × 3 complex matrix A belong to C. Thus we have the following useful fact.
Proposition 26.22. Every homography of the real projective plane RP2
or of the complex
projective plane CP2
has at least one fixed point.
Here is the classification of the homographies of RP2
based on the real Jordan form of a
3×3 matrix. Most details are left as exercises. We denote by Γ the 3×3 matrix representing
the real Jordan form of the matrix of the linear map representing the homography h.
26.11. FIXED POINTS OF HOMOGRAPHIES AND HOMOLOGIES 919
(I) Three real eigenvalues α, β, γ. The matrix Γ has the form

with α, β, γ ∈ R nonzero and all distinct. As illustrated in Figure 26.24, the homog￾raphy h has three fixed points P, Q, R, forming a triangle. The sides (lines) of this
triangle are invariant under h. The restriction of h to each of these sides is hyperbolic.

and a
homography with fixed point P and invariant line ∆. The purple (linear) hyperplane maps
to itself in a manner which is not the identity.
Observe that in Cases (III) and (IV), the homography h has a line ∆ of fixed points,
as well as a fixed point P. In Case (III), P /∈ ∆, and in Case (IV), P ∈ ∆. This kind of
homography is called a homology. The point P is called the center and the line ∆ is called
the axis (or base). Some authors only use the term homology when P /∈ ∆, and when P ∈ ∆,
they use the term elation. When P ∈ ∆, other authors use the term projective transvection,
which we prefer. The center is usually denoted by O (instead of P).
One of the nice features of homologies (and projective transvections) is that there is a
nice geometric construction of the image h(M) of a point M in terms of the center O, the
axis ∆, and any pair (A, A0 ) where A0 = h(A), A 6 = O, and A /∈ ∆.
This construction is possible because for any point M 6 = O, the line h M, h(M)i passes
through O. This can be proved using Desargues’ Theorem; for example, see Silder [161]
(Chapter 4, Section 4.2). We will prove this property for a generalization of homologies to
any projective space P(E), where E is a vector space of any finite dimension.
For the construction, first assume that M 6 = O is not on the line h A, A0 i . In this case, the
line h A, Mi intersects ∆ in some point I. Since I ∈ ∆, it is fixed by h, so the image of the
line h A, Ii is the line h A0 , Ii , and since M is on the line h A, Ii , its image M0 = h(M) is on
the line h A0 , Ii . But M0 = h(M) is also on the line h O, Mi , which implies that M0 = h(M)
is the intersection point of the lines h A0 , Ii and h O, Mi ; see Figure 26.30.
If M 6 = O is on the line h A, A0 i , then we use the construction of the image B0 of some
point B 6 = O and not on h A, A0 i as before, and then repeat the construction by finding the
intersection J of h M, Bi and ∆, and then M0 = h(M) is the intersection point of h B0 , Ji and
h
A, A0 i ; see Figure 26.31.

Another useful property of homologies (here, O /∈ ∆) is that for any line d passing
through the center O, if I is the intersection point of the line d and ∆, then for any M ∈ d
distinct from O and not on ∆ and its image M0 , the cross-ratio [O, I, M, M0 ] is independent
of d. If [O, I, M, M0 ] = −1 for all M 6 = O, we say that h is a harmonic homology. It can
be shown that a homography h is a harmonic homology iff h is an involution (h
2 = id); see
Silder [161] (Chapter 4, Section 4.4). It can also be shown that any homography of RP2
can
be expressed as the composition of two homologies; see Silder [161] (Chapter 4, Section 4.5).
We now consider the generalization of the notion of homology (and projective transvec￾tion) to any projective space P(E), where E is a vector space of any finite dimension over a
field K. We need to review a few concepts from Section 8.15.
Let E be a vector space and let H be a hyperplane in E. Recall from Definition 8.8
that for any nonzero vector u ∈ E such that u 6∈ H, and any scalar α 6 = 0, 1, a linear map
f : E → E such that f(x) = x for all x ∈ H and f(x) = αx for every x ∈ D = Ku is called
a dilatation of hyperplane H, direction D, and scale factor α. See Figure 26.34.
From Definition 8.9, for any nonzero nonlinear form ϕ ∈ E
∗ defining H (which means
that H = Ker (ϕ)) and any nonzero vector u ∈ H, the linear map τϕ,u given by
τϕ,u(x) = x + ϕ(x)u, ϕ(u) = 0,
for all x ∈ E is called a transvection of hyperplane H and direction u. See Figure 26.35.

image f(x) stays in the light-blue hyperplane since it is ”stretched“ in the u direction by a
factor of ϕ(x, y, z).
Proposition 26.23, which we repeat here for the convenience of the reader, characterizes
the linear isomorphisms f 6 = id that leave every point in the hyperplane H fixed.
Proposition 26.23. Let f : E → E be a bijective linear map of a finite-dimensional vector
space E and assume that f 6 = id and that f(x) = x for all x ∈ H, where H is some hyperplane
in E. If det(f) = 1, then f is a transvection of hyperplane H; otherwise, f is a dilatation
of hyperplane H. In either case, the vector u is uniquely defined up to a nonzero scalar.
Proof. Only the last part was not proved in Proposition 8.23, Since f is bijective and the
identity on H, the linear map f − id has kernel exactly H. Since H is a hyperplane in E,
the image of f − id has dimension 1, and since u belong to this image, it is uniquely defined
up to a nonzero scalar.
The proof of Proposition 8.23 shows that if dim(E) = n + 1 and if f is a dilatation of
hyperplane H, direction D = Ku, and scale α, then 1 is an eigenvalue of f with multiplicity
n and α 6 = 0, 1 is an eigenvalue of f with multiplicity 1; the vector u is an eigenvector for α,
and f is diagonalizable. If f is a transvection of hyperplane H and direction u, then 1 is the
only eigenvalue of f, and it has multiplicity n; the vector u is an eigenvector for 1, and f is
not diagonalizable.
A homology is the projective version of the type of maps involved in Proposition 26.23.
Definition 26.11. For any vector space E and any hyperplane H in E, a homography
h: P(E) → P(E) is a homology of axis (or base) P(H) if h(P) = P for all P ∈ P(H). In
other words, the restriction of h to P(H) is the identity. More explicitly, if h = P(f) for
some linear isomorphism f : E → E, we have P(f)(P) = P for all points P = [u] ∈ P(H).
f(x)
928 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
Using Proposition 26.23 we obtain the following characterization of homologies. Write
dim(E) = n + 1.
Proposition 26.24. If h: P(E) → P(E) is a homology of axis P(H) and if h 6 = id, then for
any linear isomorphism f : E → E such that h = P(f), the following properties hold:
(1) Either f is a dilatation of hyperplane H and of direction u for some nonzero u ∈ E−H
uniquely defined up to a scalar;
(2) Or f is a transvection of hyperplane H and direction u for some nonzero u ∈ H
uniquely defined up to a scalar.
In both cases, O = [u] ∈ P(E) is a fixed point of h, and h has no other fixed points besides O
and points in P(H). In Case (1), O /∈ P(H), whereas in Case (2), O ∈ P(H). Furthermore,
for any point M ∈ P(E), if M 6 = O and if M /∈ P(H), then the line h M, h(M)i passes
through O. If dim(E) ≥ 3, the point O is the only point satisfying the above property.
Proof. Since the restriction of h = P(f) to P(H) is the identity, and since P(f) = P(idH),
by Proposition 26.4 we have f = λidH on H for some nonzero scalar λ ∈ K. Then g = λ
−1
f
is the identity on H, so by Proposition 26.23 we obtain (1) and (2).
In Case (1), we have g(u) = αu, so P(g)([u]) = P(f)([u]) = [u]. In Case (2), g(u) = u, so
again P(g)([u]) = P(f)([u]) = [u]. Therefore, O = [u] is a fixed point of P(f). In Case (1),
the eigenvalues of f are 1 with multiplicity n and α with multiplicity 1. If Q = [v] 6 = O was
a fixed point of h not in P(H), then v would be an eigenvector corresponding to a nonzero
eigenvalue λ of f with λ 6 = 1, α, and then f would have n + 2 eigenvalues (counted with
multiplicty), which is absurd. In Case (2), the only eigenvalue of f is 1, with multiplicity
n, so f not diagonalizable, and as above, a vector v such that Q = [v] is a fixed point of h
not in P(H) would be an eigenvector corresponding to a nonzero eigenvalue λ 6 = 1 of f, so f
would be diagonalizable, a contradiction.
Since in Case (1), for any x 6 = u and x /∈ H we have x = λu + h for some unique h ∈ H
and some unique λ 6 = 0, so
g(x) = g(λu) + g(h) = λαu + h = λu + h + (λα − λ)u = x + λ(α − 1)u,
which shows that O, [x] and P(g)([x]) = P(f)([x]) are collinear. In Case (2), for any x 6 = u
and x /∈ H we have
g(x) = x + ϕ(x)u,
which also shows that O, [x] and P(g)([x]) = P(f)([x]) are collinear. The last property is left
