Similarly, we have maps

which in turn leads to the following dual formation of the right hook.
Definition 34.11. Let u

.
We can prove that
z x (u

) = (z x u

so the family of operators x p,q defines a right action

Since the left hook y :

is defined by
h

,
and v ∧ u = (−1)pqu ∧ v, we conclude that
z

x u = (−1)pq u y z

.
Similarly, since

and v

∗ = (−1)pqu

, we have
z x u

z.
We summarize the above facts in the following proposition.
1224 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
Proposition 34.20. The following identities hold:
z

x u = (−1)pq u y z

for all u ∈

p E and all z

Therefore the left and right hooks are not independent, and in fact each one determines
the other. As a consequence, we can restrict our attention to only one of the hooks, for
example the left hook, but there are a few situations where it is nice to use both, for example
in Proposition 34.23.
A version of Proposition 34.18 holds for right hooks, but beware that the indices in
ρL−H,H are permuted. This permutation has to do with the fact that the left hook and the
right hook are related via a sign factor.
Proposition 34.21. For any basis (e1, . . . , en) of E the following properties hold:

(Appendix B). However, the reader should be aware that this is not a universally accepted
notation. In fact, the left hook u
∗ y
z defined in Bourbaki [25] is our right hook z x u
∗
, up
to the sign (−1)p(p−1)/2
. This has to do with the fact that Bourbaki uses a different pairing
which also involves an extra sign, namely
h
v

y
zi = (−1)p(p−1)/2
h u
∗ ∧ v
∗
, zi .
34.7. LEFT AND RIGHT HOOKS ~ 1225
One of the side-effects of this choice is that Bourbaki’s version of Formula (4) of Proposition
34.18 (Bourbaki [25], Chapter III, page 168) is
e
∗
H y eL = 0 if H 6⊆ L
e
∗
H y eL = (−1)p(p−1)/2
ρH,L−HeL−H if H ⊆ L,
where |H| = p and |L| = p + q. This correspond to Formula (1) of Proposition 34.21 up
to the sign factor (−1)p(p−1)/2
, which we find horribly confusing. Curiously, an older edition
of Bourbaki (1958) uses the same pairing as Fulton and Harris [68]. The reason (and the
advantage) for this change of sign convention is not clear to us.
We also have the following version of Proposition 34.19 for the right hook.
Proposition 34.22. For the right hook
x
:
q+1
^
E
∗ × E −→
q
^
E
∗
,
for every u ∈ E, x
∗ ∈
V
r E
∗
, and y
∗ ∈
V
q+1−r E
∗
, we have
(x
∗ ∧ y
∗
) x u = (x
∗
x u) ∧ y
∗ + (−1)rx
∗ ∧ (y
∗
x u).
Proof. A proof involving determinants can be found in Warner [186], Chapter 2.
Thus, x :
V
q+1 E
∗ × E −→ V q E
∗
is an anti-derivation. A similar formula holds for the
the right hook x :
V
q+1 E × E
∗ −→ V q E, namely
(x ∧ y) x u
∗ = (x x u
∗
) ∧ y + (−1)rx ∧ (y x u
∗
),
for every u
∗ ∈ E, ∈
V
r E, and y ∈
V
q+1−r E. This formula is used by Shafarevitch [158] to
define a hook, but beware that Shafarevitch use the left hook notation u
∗ y x rather than
the right hook notation. Shafarevitch uses the terminology convolution, which seems very
unfortunate.
For u ∈ E, the right hook z
∗ x u is also denoted i(u)z
∗
, and called insertion operator or
interior product. This operator plays an important role in differential geometry.
Definition 34.12. Let u ∈ E and z
∗ ∈
V
n+1(E
∗
). If we view z
∗ as an alternating multilinear
map in Altn+1(E; K), then we define i(u)z
∗ ∈ Altn
(E; K) as given by
(i(u)z
∗
)(v1, . . . , vn) = z
∗
(u, v1, . . . , vn).
Using the left hook y and the right hook x we can define two linear maps γ :
V
p E →
V n−p E
∗ and δ :
V
p E
∗ →
V n−p E as follows:
1226 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
Definition 34.13. For any basis (e1, . . . , en) of E, if we let M = {1, . . . , n}, e = e1∧· · ·∧en,
and e
∗ = e
∗
1 ∧ · · · ∧ e
∗
n
, define γ :
V
p E →
V n−p E
∗ and δ :
V
p E
∗ →
V n−p E as
γ(u) = u y e
∗
and δ(v
∗
) = e x v
∗
,
for all u ∈
V
p E and all v
∗ ∈
V
p E
∗
.
Proposition 34.23. The linear maps γ :
V
p E →
V n−p E
∗ and δ :
V
p E
∗ →
V n−p E are
isomorphims, and γ
−1 = δ. The isomorphisms γ and δ map decomposable vectors to de￾composable vectors. Furthermore, if z ∈
V
p E is decomposable, say z = u1 ∧ · · · ∧ up for
some ui ∈ E, then γ(z) = v1
∗ ∧ · · · ∧ vn
∗
−p
for some vj
∗ ∈ E
∗
, and vj
∗
(ui) = 0 for all i, j. A
similar property holds for v
∗ ∈
V
p E
∗ and δ(v
∗
). If (e
01
, . . . , e0n
) is any other basis of E and
γ
0 :
V
p E →
V n−p E
∗ and δ
0 :
V
p E
∗ →
V n−p E are the corresponding isomorphisms, then
γ
0 = λγ and δ
0 = λ
−1
δ for some nonzero λ ∈ K.
Proof. Using Propositions 34.18 and 34.21, for any subset J ⊆ {1, . . . , n} = M such that
|J| = p, we have
γ(eJ ) = eJ y e
∗ = ρM−J,J e
∗
M−J
and δ(e
∗
M−J
) = e x e
∗
M−J = ρM−J,J eJ .
Thus,
δ ◦ γ(eJ ) = ρM−J,J ρM−J,J eJ = eJ ,
since ρM−J,J = ±1. A similar result holds for γ ◦ δ. This implies that
δ ◦ γ = id and γ ◦ δ = id.
Thus, γ and δ are inverse isomorphisms.
If z ∈
V
p E is decomposable, then z = u1 ∧ · · · ∧ up where u1, . . . , up are linearly inde￾pendent since z 6 = 0, and we can pick a basis of E of the form (u1, . . . , un). Then the above
formulae show that
γ(z) = ±u
∗
p+1 ∧ · · · ∧ u
∗
n
.
Since (u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
) is the dual basis of (u1, . . . , un), we have u
∗
i
(uj ) = δij , If (e
01
, . . . , e0n
) is any
other basis of E, because V n E has dimension 1, we have
e
01 ∧ · · · ∧ e
0n = λe1 ∧ · · · ∧ en
for some nonzero λ ∈ K, and the rest is trivial.
Applying Proposition 34.23 to the case where p = n − 1, the isomorphism γ :
V
n−1 E →
V
1 E
∗ maps indecomposable vectors in V n−1 E to indecomposable vectors in V 1 E
∗ = E
∗
.
But every vector in E
∗
is decomposable, so every vector in V n−1 E is decomposable.
Corollary 34.24. If E is a finite-dimensional vector space, then every vector in V n−1 E is
decomposable.
34.8. TESTING DECOMPOSABILITY ~ 1227
34.8 Testing Decomposability ~
We are now ready to tackle the problem of finding criteria for decomposability. Such criteria
will use the left hook. Once again, in this section all vector spaces are assumed to have finite
dimension. But before stating our criteria, we need a few preliminary results.
Proposition 34.25. Given z ∈
V
p E with z 6 = 0, the smallest vector space W ⊆ E such
that z ∈
V
p W is generated by the vectors of the form
u
∗
y
z, with u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
.
Proof. First let W be any subspace such that z ∈
V
p
(W) and let (e1, . . . , er, er+1, . . . , en) be a
basis of E such that (e1, . . . , er) is a basis of W. Then, u
∗ =
P I
λI e
∗
I
, where I ⊆ {1, . . . , n}
and |I| = p − 1, and z =
P J µJ eJ , where J ⊆ {1, . . . , r} and |J| = p ≤ r. It follows
immediately from the formula of Proposition 34.18 (4), namely
e
∗
I y
eJ = ρJ−I,J eJ−I ,
that u
∗ y
z ∈ W, since J − I ⊆ {1, . . . , r}.
Next we prove that if W is the smallest subspace of E such that z ∈
V
p
(W), then W is
generated by the vectors of the form u
∗ y
z, where u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
. Suppose not. Then the
vectors u
∗ y
z with u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
span a proper subspace U of W. We prove that for every
subspace W0 of W with dim(W0 ) = dim(W) − 1 = r − 1, it is not possible that u
∗ y
z ∈ W0
for all u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
. But then, as U is a proper subspace of W, it is contained in some
subspace W0 with dim(W0 ) = r − 1, and we have a contradiction.
Let w ∈ W − W0 and pick a basis of W formed by a basis (e1, . . . , er−1) of W0 and w.
Any z ∈
V
p
(W) can be written as z = z
0 + w ∧ z
00 , where z
0 ∈
V
p W0 and z
00 ∈
V
p−1 W0 ,
and since W is the smallest subspace containing z, we have z
00 6 = 0. Consequently, if we
write z
00 =
P I
λI eI in terms of the basis (e1, . . . , er−1) of W0 , there is some eI , with I ⊆
{
E
1, . . . , r
containing (
− 1} and
e1, . . . , e
|I| =
r−
p
1, w
− 1, so that the coefficient
), by Proposition 34.18 (4), we see that
λI is nonzero. Now, using any basis of
e
∗
I y
(w ∧ eI ) = λw, λ = ±1.
It follows that
e
∗
I y
z = e
∗
I y
(z
0 + w ∧ z
00 ) = e
∗
I y
z
0 + e
∗
I y
(w ∧ z
00 ) = e
∗
I y
z
0 + λλIw,
with e
∗
I
y
z
0 ∈ W0 , which shows that e
∗
I
y
z /∈ W0 . Therefore, W is indeed generated by the
vectors of the form u
∗ y
z, where u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
.
To help understand Proposition 34.25, let E be the vector space with basis {e1, e2, e3, e4}
and z = e1 ∧ e2 + e2 ∧ e3. Note that z ∈
V
2 E. To find the smallest vector space W ⊆ E
1228 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
such that z ∈
V
2 W, we calculate u
∗ y
z, where u
∗ ∈
V
1 E
∗
. The multilinearity of y implies
it is enough to calculate u
∗ y
z for u
∗ ∈ {e
∗
1
, e∗
2
, e∗
3
, e∗
4}. Proposition 34.18 (4) implies that
e
∗
1 y
z = e
∗
1 y
(e1 ∧ e2 + e2 ∧ e3) = e
∗
1 y
e1 ∧ e2 = −e2
e
∗
2 y
z = e
∗
2 y
(e1 ∧ e2 + e2 ∧ e3) = e1 − e3
e
∗
3 y
z = e
∗
3 y
(e1 ∧ e2 + e2 ∧ e3) = e
∗
3 y
e2 ∧ e3 = e2
e
∗
4 y
z = e
∗
4 y
(e1 ∧ e2 + e2 ∧ e3) = 0.
Thus W is the two-dimensional vector space generated by the basis {e2, e1 − e3}. This is
not surprising since z = −e2 ∧ (e1 − e3) and is in fact decomposable. As this example
demonstrates, the action of the left hook provides a way of extracting a basis of W from z.
Proposition 34.25 implies the following corollary.
Corollary 34.26. Any nonzero z ∈
V
p E is decomposable iff the smallest subspace W of E
such that z ∈
V
p W has dimension p. Furthermore, if z = u1 ∧· · ·∧up is decomposable, then
(u1, . . . , up) is a basis of the smallest subspace W of E such that z ∈
V
p W
Proof. If dim(W) = p, then for any basis (e1, . . . , ep) of W we know that V p W has e1∧· · ·∧ep
has a basis, and thus has dimension 1. Since z ∈
V
p W, we have z = λe1 ∧ · · · ∧ ep for some
nonzero λ, so z is decomposable.
Conversely assume that z ∈
V
p W is nonzero and decomposable. Then, z = u1 ∧ · · · ∧up,
and since z 6 = 0, by Proposition 34.8 (u1, . . . , up) are linearly independent. Then for any
vi
∗ = u
∗
1 ∧ · · · u
∗
i−1 ∧ u
∗
i+1 ∧ · · · ∧ u
∗
p
(where u
∗
i
is omitted), we have
v
∗
i y
z = (u
∗
1 ∧ · · · u
∗
i−1 ∧ u
∗
i+1 ∧ · · · ∧ u
∗
p
) y (u1 ∧ · · · ∧ up) = ±ui
,
so by Proposition 34.25 we have ui ∈ W for i = 1, . . . , p. This shows that dim(W) ≥ p, but
since z = u1 ∧ · · · ∧ up, we have dim(W) = p, which means that (u1, . . . , up) is a basis of
W.
Finally we are ready to state and prove the criterion for decomposability with respect to
left hooks.
Proposition 34.27. Any nonzero z ∈
V
p E is decomposable iff
(u
∗
y
z) ∧ z = 0, for all u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
.
Proof. First assume that z ∈
V
p E is decomposable. If so, by Corollary 34.26, the smallest
subspace W of E such that z ∈
V
p W has dimension p, so we have z = e1 ∧ · · · ∧ ep
where e1, . . . , ep form a basis of W. By Proposition 34.25, for every u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
, we have
u
∗ y
z ∈ W, so each u
∗ y
z is a linear combination of the ei
’s, say
u
∗
y
z = α1e1 + · · · + αpep,
34.8. TESTING DECOMPOSABILITY ~ 1229
and
(u
∗
y
z) ∧ z =
p
X
i=1
αiei ∧ e1 ∧ · · · ∧ ei ∧ · · · ∧ ep = 0.
Now assume that (u
∗ y
z)∧z = 0 for all u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
, and that dim(W) = m > p, where
W is the smallest subspace of E such that z ∈
V
p W If e1, . . . , em is a basis of W, then we
have z =
P I
λI eI , where I ⊆ {1, . . . , m} and |I| = p. Recall that z 6 = 0, and so, some λI is
nonzero. By Proposition 34.25, each ei can be written as u
∗ y
z for some u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
, and
since (u
∗ y
z) ∧ z = 0 for all u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E
∗
, we get
ej ∧ z = 0 for j = 1, . . . , m.
By wedging z =
P I
λI eI with each ej
, as m > p, we deduce λI = 0 for all I, so z = 0, a
contradiction. Therefore, m = p and Corollary 34.26 implies that z is decomposable.
As a corollary of Proposition 34.27 we obtain the following fact that we stated earlier
without proof.
Proposition 34.28. Given any vector space E of dimension n, a vector x ∈
V
2 E is de￾composable iff x ∧ x = 0.
Proof. Recall that as an application of Proposition 34.19 we proved the formula (†), namely
u
∗
y
(x ∧ x) = 2((u
∗
y x) ∧ x)
for all x ∈
V
2 E and all u
∗ ∈ E
∗
. As a consequence, (u
∗ y x) ∧ x = 0 iff u
∗ y
(x ∧ x) = 0.
By Proposition 34.27, the 2-vector x is decomposable iff u
∗ y
(x ∧ x) = 0 for all u
∗ ∈ E
∗
iff
x ∧ x = 0. Therefore, a 2-vector x is decomposable iff x ∧ x = 0.
As an application of Proposition 34.28, assume that dim(E) = 3 and that (e1, e2, e3) is a
basis of E. Then any 2-vector x ∈
V
2 E is of the form
x = αe1 ∧ e2 + βe1 ∧ e3 + γe2 ∧ e3.
We have
x ∧ x = (αe1 ∧ e2 + βe1 ∧ e3 + γe2 ∧ e3) ∧ (αe1 ∧ e2 + βe1 ∧ e3 + γe2 ∧ e3) = 0,
because all the terms involved are of the form c ei1 ∧ei2 ∧ei3 ∧ei4 with i1, i2, i3, i4 ∈ {1, 2, 3},
and so at least two of these indices are identical. Therefore, every 2-vector x = αe1 ∧ e2 +
βe1 ∧ e3 + γe2 ∧ e3 is decomposable, although this not obvious at first glance. For example,
e1 ∧ e2 + e1 ∧ e3 + e2 ∧ e3 = (e1 + e2) ∧ (e2 + e3).
We now show that Proposition 34.27 yields an equational criterion for the decomposability
of an alternating tensor z ∈
V
p E.

We follow an argument adapted from Bourbaki [25] (Chapter III, §11, Section 13).
Let E be a vector space of dimensions n, let (e1, . . . , en) be a basis of E, and let (e

be its dual basis. Our objective is to determine whether a nonzero vector z ∈
V
p E is
decomposable. By Proposition 34.27, the vector z is decomposable iff (u

z) ∧ z = 0 for all
u
∗ ∈
V
p−1 E

. We can let u

range over a basis of V p−1 E

, and then the conditions are
(e

H y z) ∧ z = 0
for all H ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, with |H| = p − 1. Since (e

H y z) ∧ z ∈
V
p+1 E, this is equivalent to
h

H y z) ∧ zi = 0
for all H, J ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, with |H| = p − 1 and |J| = p + 1. Then, for all I, I0 ⊆ {1, . . . , n}
with |I| = |I
0 | = p, Formulae (2) and (4) of Proposition 34.18 show that

unless there is some i ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that
I − H = {i}, J − I
0 = {i}.
In this case, I = H ∪ {i} and I
