vectors! For notational simplicity, we will often denote an affine space 
 E,
−→E , +
 by (E,
−→E ),
or even by E. The vector space −→E is called the vector space associated with E.

One should be careful about the overloading of the addition symbol +. Addition
is well-defined on vectors, as in u + v; the translate a + u of a point a ∈ E by a
vector u ∈
−→E is also well-defined, but addition of points a + b does not make sense. In
this respect, the notation b − a for the unique vector u such that b = a + u is somewhat
confusing, since it suggests that points can be subtracted (but not added!).
Any vector space −→E has an affine space structure specified by choosing E =
−→E , and
letting + be addition in the vector space −→E . We will refer to the affine structure 
 −→E ,
−→E , +

on a vector space
−→E as the canonical (or natural) affine structure on −→E . In particular, the
vector space R
n
can be viewed as the affine space 
 R
n
, R
n
, +
 , denoted by A
n
. In general,
if K is any field, the affine space 
 Kn
, Kn
, +
 is denoted by A
n
K. In order to distinguish
between the double role played by members of R
n
, points and vectors, we will denote points
by row vectors, and vectors by column vectors. Thus, the action of the vector space R
n over
the set R
n
simply viewed as a set of points is given by
(a1, . . . , an) +


u1
.
.
.
un

 = (a1 + u1, . . . , an + un).
We will also use the convention that if x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ R
n
, then the column vector
associated with x is denoted by x (in boldface notation). Abusing the notation slightly, if
a ∈ R
n
is a point, we also write a ∈ A
n
. The affine space A
n
is called the real affine space of
dimension n. In most cases, we will consider n = 1, 2, 3.

24.2 Examples of Affine Spaces
Let us now give an example of an affine space that is not given as a vector space (at least, not
in an obvious fashion). Consider the subset L of A
2
consisting of all points (x, y) satisfying
the equation
x + y − 1 = 0.
The set L is the line of slope −1 passing through the points (1, 0) and (0, 1) shown in Figure
24.5.
The line L can be made into an official affine space by defining the action +: L × R → L
of R on L defined such that for every point (x, 1 − x) on L and any u ∈ R,
(x, 1 − x) + u = (x + u, 1 − x − u).
It is immediately verified that this action makes L into an affine space. For example, for any
two points a = (a1, 1 − a1) and b = (b1, 1 − b1) on L, the unique (vector) u ∈ R such that
b = a + u is u = b1 − a1. Note that the vector space R is isomorphic to the line of equation
x + y = 0 passing through the origin.
Similarly, consider the subset H of A
3
consisting of all points (x, y, z) satisfying the
equation
x + y + z − 1 = 0.
The set H is the plane passing through the points (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1). The plane
H can be made into an official affine space by defining the action +: H × R
2 → H of R

For a slightly wilder example, consider the subset P of A
3
consisting of all points (x, y, z)
satisfying the equation
x
2 + y
2 − z = 0.
The set P is a paraboloid of revolution, with axis Oz. The surface P can be made into an
official affine space by defining the action +: P × R
2 → P of R
2 on P defined such that for
every point (x, y, x2 + y

).
See Figure 24.7.
This should dispel any idea that affine spaces are dull. Affine spaces not already equipped
with an obvious vector space structure arise in projective geometry.
24.3 Chasles’s Identity
Given any three points a, b, c ∈ E, since c = a +
−→ac, b = a +
−→ab, and c = b +
−→bc, we get
c = b +
−→bc = (a +
−→ab) + −→bc = a + (−→ab +

which is known as Chasles’s identity, and illustrated in Figure 24.8.
Since a = a +
−→aa and by (A1) a = a + 0, by (A3) we get
−→aa = 0.
Thus, letting a = c in Chasles’s identity, we get
−→ba = −
−→ab.
Given any four points a, b, c, d ∈ E, since by Chasles’s identity
−→ab +
−→bc =
−→ad +
−→dc =
−→ac,
we have the parallelogram law
−→ab =
−→dc iff −→bc =
−→ad.
24.4 Affine Combinations, Barycenters
A fundamental concept in linear algebra is that of a linear combination. The corresponding
concept in affine geometry is that of an affine combination, also called a barycenter . However,
there is a problem with the naive approach involving a coordinate system, as we saw in
Section 24.1. Since this problem is the reason for introducing affine combinations, at the

risk of boring certain readers, we give another example showing what goes wrong if we are
not careful in defining linear combinations of points.
Consider R
2 as an affine space, under its natural coordinate system with origin O = (0, 0)
and basis vectors  1
0

and  0
1

. Given any two points a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2), it is
natural to define the affine combination λa + µb as the point of coordinates
(λa1 + µb1, λa2 + µb2).
Thus, when a = (−1, −1) and b = (2, 2), the point a + b is the point c = (1, 1).
Let us now consider the new coordinate system with respect to the origin c = (1, 1) (and
the same basis vectors). This time, the coordinates of a are (−2, −2), the coordinates of b
are (1, 1), and the point a+b is the point d of coordinates (−1, −1). However, it is clear that
the point d is identical to the origin O = (0, 0) of the first coordinate system. This situation
is illustrated in Figure 24.9.
Thus, a + b corresponds to two different points depending on which coordinate system is
used for its computation!
This shows that some extra condition is needed in order for affine combinations to make
sense. It turns out that if the scalars sum up to 1, the definition is intrinsic, as the following
proposition shows.
Proposition 24.1. Given an affine space E, let (ai)i∈I be a family of points in E, and let
(λi)i∈I be a family of scalars. For any two points a, b ∈ E, the following properties hold:
(1) If P i∈I
λi = 1, then
a +
X
i∈I
λi

Figure 24.10: Part (1) of Proposition 24.1.
Thus, by Proposition 24.1, for any family of points (ai)i∈I in E, for any family (λi)i∈I of
scalars such that P i∈I
λi = 1, the point
x = a +
X
i∈I
λi
−→aai
is independent of the choice of the origin a ∈ E. This property motivates the following
definition.
Definition 24.2. For any family of points (ai)i∈I in E, for any family (λi)i∈I of scalars such
that P i∈I
λi = 1, and for any a ∈ E, the point
a +
X
i∈I
λi
−→aai
(which is independent of a ∈ E, by Proposition 24.1) is called the barycenter (or barycentric
combination, or affine combination) of the points ai assigned the weights λi
, and it is denoted
by
X
i∈I
λiai
.
In dealing with barycenters, it is convenient to introduce the notion of a weighted point,
which is just a pair (a, λ), where a ∈ E is a point, and λ ∈ R is a scalar. Then, given a family
of weighted points ((ai
, λi))i∈I , where P i∈I
λi = 1, we also say that the point P i∈I
λiai
is
the barycenter of the family of weighted points ((ai
, λi))i∈I .
Note that the barycenter x of the family of weighted points ((ai
, λi))i∈I is the unique
point such that
−→ax =
X
i∈I
λi
−→aai
for every a ∈ E,
806 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
and setting a = x, the point x is the unique point such that
X
i∈I
λi
−→xai = 0.
In physical terms, the barycenter is the center of mass of the family of weighted points
((ai
, λi))i∈I (where the masses have been normalized, so that P i∈I
λi = 1, and negative
masses are allowed).
Remarks:
(1) Since the barycenter of a family ((ai
, λi))i∈I of weighted points is defined for families
(λi)i∈I of scalars with finite support (and such that P i∈I
λi = 1), we might as well
assume that I is finite. Then, for all m ≥ 2, it is easy to prove that the barycenter
of m weighted points can be obtained by repeated computations of barycenters of two
weighted points.
(2) This result still holds, provided that the field K has at least three distinct elements,
but the proof is trickier!
(3) When P i∈I
λi = 0, the vector P i∈I
λi
−→aai does not depend on the point a, and we may
denote it by P i∈I
λiai
. This observation will be used to define a vector space in which
linear combinations of both points and vectors make sense, regardless of the value of
P
i∈I
λi
.

weighted points ￾ a, 4

The point g1 can be constructed geometrically as the middle of the segment joining c to
the middle 2

Later on, we will see that a polynomial curve can be defined as a set of barycenters of a
fixed number of points. For example, let (a, b, c, d) be a sequence of points in A

Such a curve is called a B´ezier curve, and (a, b, c, d) are called its control points. Note that
the curve passes through a and d, but generally not through b and c. It can be sbown
that any point F(t) on the curve can be constructed using an algorithm performing affine
interpolation steps (the de Casteljau algorithm).
24.5 Affine Subspaces
In linear algebra, a (linear) subspace can be characterized as a nonempty subset of a vector
space closed under linear combinations. In affine spaces, the notion corresponding to the
notion of (linear) subspace is the notion of affine subspace. It is natural to define an affine
subspace as a subset of an affine space closed under affine combinations.
Definition 24.3. Given an affine space 
 E,
−→E , +
 , a subset V of E is an affine subspace (of


E,
−→E , +
 ) if for every family of weighted points ((ai
, λi))i∈I in V such that P i∈I
λi = 1,
the barycenter P i∈I
λiai belongs to V .
808 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
An affine subspace is also called a flat by some authors. According to Definition 24.3,
the empty set is trivially an affine subspace, and every intersection of affine subspaces is an
affine subspace.
As an example, consider the subset U of R
2 defined by
U =
 (x, y) ∈ R
2
| ax + by = c
	 ,
i.e., the set of solutions of the equation
ax + by = c,
where it is assumed that a 6 = 0 or b 6 = 0. Given any m points (xi
, yi) ∈ U and any m scalars
λi such that λ1 + · · · + λm = 1, we claim that
mX
i=1
λi(xi
, yi) ∈ U.
Indeed, (xi
, yi) ∈ U means that
axi + byi = c,
and if we multiply both sides of this equation by λi and add up the resulting m equations,
we get
mX
i=1
(λiaxi + λibyi) =
mX
i=1
λic,
and since λ1 + · · · + λm = 1, we get
a
 
mX
i=1
λixi
! + b
 
mX
i=1
λiyi
! =
 
mX
i=1
λi
! c = c,
which shows that
 
mX
i=1
λixi
,
mX
i=1
λiyi
! =
mX
i=1
λi(xi
, yi) ∈ U.
Thus, U is an affine subspace of A
2
. In fact, it is just a usual line in A
2
.
It turns out that U is closely related to the subset of R
2 defined by
−→U =
 (x, y) ∈ R
2
| ax + by = 0	 ,
i.e., the set of solutions of the homogeneous equation
ax + by = 0

obtained by setting the right-hand side of ax + by = c to zero. Indeed, for any m scalars λi
,
the same calculation as above yields that
mX
i=1
λi(xi
, yi) ∈
−→U ,
this time without any restriction on the λi
, since the right-hand side of the equation is
null. Thus, −→U is a subspace of R
2
. In fact, −→U is one-dimensional, and it is just a usual line
in R
2
. This line can be identified with a line passing through the origin of A
2
, a line that is
parallel to the line U of equation ax + by = c, as illustrated in Figure 24.12.
Now, if (x0, y0) is any point in U, we claim that
U = (x0, y0) + −→U ,
where
(x0, y0) + −→U =
n (x0 + u1, y0 + u2) | (u1, u2) ∈
−→U
o .
First, (x0, y0) + −→U ⊆ U, since ax0 + by0 = c and au1 + bu2 = 0 for all (u1, u2) ∈
−→U . Second,
if (x, y) ∈ U, then ax + by = c, and since we also have ax0 + by0 = c, by subtraction, we get
a(x − x0) + b(y − y0) = 0,
which shows that (x − x0, y − y0) ∈
−→U , and thus (x, y) ∈ (x0, y0) + −→U . Hence, we also have
U ⊆ (x0, y0) + −→U , and U = (x0, y0) + −→U .
The above example shows that the affine line U defined by the equation
ax + by = c
810 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
is obtained by “translating” the parallel line −→U of equation
ax + by = 0
passing through the origin. In fact, given any point (x0, y0) ∈ U,
U = (x0, y0) + −→U .
More generally, it is easy to prove the following fact. Given any m × n matrix A and any
vector b ∈ R
m, the subset U of R
n defined by
U = {x ∈ R
n
| Ax = b}
is an affine subspace of A
n
.
Actually, observe that Ax = b should really be written as Ax> = b, to be consistent with
our convention that points are represented by row vectors. We can also use the boldface
notation for column vectors, in which case the equation is written as Ax = b. For the sake of
minimizing the amount of notation, we stick to the simpler (yet incorrect) notation Ax = b.
If we consider the corresponding homogeneous equation Ax = 0, the set
−→U = {x ∈ R
n
| Ax = 0}
is a subspace of R
n
, and for any x0 ∈ U, we have
U = x0 +
−→U .
This is a general situation. Affine subspaces can be characterized in terms of subspaces of
−→E . Let V be a nonempty subset of E. For every family (a1, . . . , an) in V , for any family
(λ1, . . . , λn) of scalars, and for every point a ∈ V , observe that x ∈ E given by
x = a +
nX

Given any point a ∈ E and any subset −→V of −→E , let a +

Proposition 24.2. Let 
 E,
−→E , +
 be an affine space.
(1) A nonempty subset V of E is an affine subspace iff for every point a ∈ V , the set
−→Va = {
−→ax | x ∈ V }
is a subspace of −→E . Consequently, V = a +
−→Va. Furthermore,
−→V = {
−→xy | x, y ∈ V }
is a subspace of −→E and −→Va =
−→V for all a ∈ E. Thus, V = a +
−→V .
(2) For any subspace −→V of −→E and for any a ∈ E, the set V = a+
−→V is an affine subspace.
Proof. The proof is straightforward, and is omitted. It is also given in Gallier [70].
In particular, when E is the natural affine space associated with a vector space −→E ,
Proposition 24.2 shows that every affine subspace of E is of the form u +
−→U , for a subspace
−→U of −→E . The subspaces of −→E are the affine subspaces of E that contain 0.
The subspace −→V associated with an affine subspace V is called the direction of V . It is
also clear that the map +: V ×
−→V → V induced by +: E ×
−→E → E confers to 
 V,
−→V , +
 an
affine structure. Figure 24.13 illustrates the notion of affine subspace.
By the dimension of the subspace V , we mean the dimension of −→V .
An affine subspace of dimension 1 is called a line, and an affine subspace of dimension 2
is called a plane.
812 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
An affine subspace of codimension 1 is called a hyperplane (recall that a subspace F of
a vector space E has codimension 1 iff there is some subspace G of dimension 1 such that
E = F ⊕ G, the direct sum of F and G, see Strang [170] or Lang [109]).
We say that two affine subspaces U and V are parallel if their directions are identical.
Equivalently, since −→U =
−→V , we have U = a +
−→U and V = b +
−→U for any a ∈ U and any
b ∈ V , and thus V is obtained from U by the translation
−→ab.
In general, when we talk about n points a1, . . . , an, we mean the sequence (a1, . . . , an),
and not the set {a1, . . . , an} (the ai
’s need not be distinct).
By Proposition 24.2, a line is specified by a point a ∈ E and a nonzero vector v ∈
−→E ,
i.e., a line is the set of all points of the form a + λv, for λ ∈ R.
We say that three points a, b, c are collinear if the vectors −→ab and −→ac are linearly depen￾dent. If two of the points a, b, c are distinct, say a 6 = b, then there is a unique λ ∈ R such
that −→ac = λ
−→ab, and we define the ratio −→

A plane is specified by a point a ∈ E and two linearly independent vectors u, v ∈
−→E , i.e.,
a plane is the set of all points of the form a + λu + µv, for λ, µ ∈ R.
We say that four points a, b, c, d are coplanar if the vectors −→ab, −→ac, and
−→ad are linearly
dependent. Hyperplanes will be characterized a little later.
Proposition 24.3. Given an affine space 
 E,
−→E , +
 , for any family (ai)i∈I of points in
E, the set V of barycenters P i∈I
λiai (where P i∈I
λi = 1) is the smallest affine subspace
containing (ai)i∈I .
Proof. If (ai)i∈I is empty, then V = ∅, because of the condition P i∈I
λi = 1. If (ai)i∈I is
nonempty, then the smallest affine subspace containing (ai)i∈I must contain the set V of
barycenters P i∈I
λiai
, and thus, it is enough to show that V is closed under affine combina￾tions, which is immediately verified.
Given a nonempty subset S of E, the smallest affine subspace of E generated by S is
often denoted by h Si . For example, a line specified by two distinct points a and b is denoted
by h a, bi , or even (a, b), and similarly for planes, etc.
Remarks:
(1) Since it can be shown that the barycenter of n weighted points can be obtained by
repeated computations of barycenters of two weighted points, a nonempty subset V
of E is an affine subspace iff for every two points a, b ∈ V , the set V contains all
barycentric combinations of a and b. If V contains at least two points, then V is an
affine subspace iff for any two distinct points a, b ∈ V , the set V contains the line
determined by a and b, that is, the set of all points (1 − λ)a + λb, λ ∈ R.
(2) This result still holds if the field K has at least three distinct elements, but the proof
is trickier!

24.6 Affine Independence and Affine Frames
Corresponding to the notion of linear independence in vector spaces, we have the notion of
affine independence. Given a family (ai)i∈I of points in an affine space E, we will reduce the
notion of (affine) independence of these points to the (linear) independence of the families
(
−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i}) of vectors obtained by choosing any ai as an origin. First, the following
proposition shows that it is sufficient to consider only one of these families.
Proposition 24.4. Given an affine space 
 E,
−→E , +
 , let (ai)i∈I be a family of points in
E. If the family (
−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is linearly independent for some i ∈ I, then (
−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is
linearly independent for every i ∈ I.
Proof. Assume that the family (−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is linearly independent for some specific i ∈ I.
Let k ∈ I with k 6 = i, and assume that there are some scalars (λj )j∈(I−{k}) such that
X
j∈(I−{k})
λj
−−→akaj = 0.
Since
−−→akaj =
−−→akai +
−−→aiaj
,
we have
X
j∈(I−{k})
λj
−−→akaj =
X
j∈(I−{k})
λj
−−→akai +
X
j∈(I−{k})
λj
−−→aiaj
,
=
X
j∈(I−{k})
λj
−−→akai +
X
j∈(I−{i,k})
λj
−−→aiaj
,
=
X
j∈(I−{i,k})
λj
−−→aiaj −

X
j∈(I−{k})
λj

−−→aiak,
and thus
X
j∈(I−{i,k})
λj
−−→aiaj −

X
j∈(I−{k})
λj

−−→aiak = 0.
Since the family (−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is linearly independent, we must have λj = 0 for all j ∈
(I − {i, k}) and P j∈(I−{k})
λj = 0, which implies that λj = 0 for all j ∈ (I − {k}).
We define affine independence as follows.
Definition 24.4. Given an affine space 
 E,
−→E , +
 , a family (ai)i∈I of points in E is affinely
independent if the family (−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is linearly independent for some i ∈ I.

Figure 24.14: Affine independence and linear independence
Definition 24.4 is reasonable, because by Proposition 24.4, the independence of the family
(
−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i}) does not depend on the choice of ai
. A crucial property of linearly independent
vectors (u1, . . . , um) is that if a vector v is a linear combination
v =
mX
i=1
λiui
of the ui
, then the λi are unique. A similar result holds for affinely independent points.
Proposition 24.5. Given an affine space 
 E,
−→E , +
 , let (a0, . . . , am) be a family of m + 1
points in E. Let x ∈ E, and assume that x =
P
m
i=0 λiai, where P m
i=0 λi = 1. Then,
the family (λ0, . . . , λm) such that x =
P
m
i=0 λiai
is unique iff the family (
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) is
linearly independent.
Proof. The proof is straightforward and is omitted. It is also given in Gallier [70].
Proposition 24.5 suggests the notion of affine frame. Affine frames are the affine analogues
of bases in vector spaces. Let 
 E,
−→E , +
 be a nonempty affine space, and let (a0, . . . , am)
be a family of m + 1 points in E. The family (a0, . . . , am) determines the family of m
vectors (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) in −→E . Conversely, given a point a0 in E and a family of m vectors
(u1, . . . , um) in −→E , we obtain the family of m+1 points (a0, . . . , am) in E, where ai = a0+ui
,
1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Thus, for any m ≥ 1, it is equivalent to consider a family of m + 1 points (a0, . . . , am) in
E, and a pair (a0,(u1, . . . , um)), where the ui are vectors in
−→E . Figure 24.14 illustrates the
notion of affine independence.
24.6. AFFINE INDEPENDENCE AND AFFINE FRAMES 815
Remark: The above observation also applies to infinite families (ai)i∈I of points in E and
families (ui)i∈I−{0} of vectors in −→E , provided that the index set I contains 0.
When (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) is a basis of −→E then, for every x ∈ E, since x = a0 +
−→a0x, there
is a unique family (x1, . . . , xm) of scalars such that
x = a0 + x1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + xm
−−→a0am.
The scalars (x1, . . . , xm) may be considered as coordinates with respect to
(a0,(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am)). Since
x = a0 +

iff x =

! a0 +

x ∈ E can also be expressed uniquely as
x =

λiai
with P m
i=0 λi = 1, and where λ0 = 1 −
P
m
i=1 xi
, and λi = xi
for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The scalars
(λ0, . . . , λm) are also certain kinds of coordinates with respect to (a0, . . . , am). All this is
summarized in the following definition.
Definition 24.5. Given an affine space 
 E,

 , an affine frame with origin a0 is a family
(a0, . . . , am) of m + 1 points in E such that the list of vectors (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
