as an exercise (see Vienne [185], Chapter 4, Proposition 7).
Proposition 26.24 suggests the following definition.
26.11. FIXED POINTS OF HOMOGRAPHIES AND HOMOLOGIES 929
Definition 26.12. Let h: P(E) → P(E) be a homology of axis P(H) with h 6 = id, where
h = P(f) for some linear isomorphism f : E → E. The fixed point O = [u] associated with
the vector u involved in the definition of f, which is unique up to a scalar, is called the center
of h. If O ∈ P(H), then h is called a projective transvection (or elation).
The same geometric construction that we used in the case of the projective plane shows
that a homology is determined by its center O, its axis P(H), and a pair of points A and
A0 = h(A), with A 6 = O and A /∈ P(H). As a kind of converse, we have the following
proposition which is easily shown; see Vienne [185] (Chapter IV, Proposition 8).
Proposition 26.25. Let P(H) be a hyperplane of P(E) and let O ∈ P(E) be a point. For any
pair of distinct points (A, A0 ) such that O, A, A0 are collinear and A, A0 ∈/ P(H) ∪ {O}, there
is a unique homology h: P(E) → P(E) of centrer O and axis P(H) such that h(A) = A0 .
Remark: From the proof of Proposition 8.23, since every dilatation can be represented by
a matrix of the form

we see that by choosing the hyperplane at infinity to be x1 = 0, on the affine hyperplane x1 =
1, a homology becomes a central magnification by α

. Similarly, since every transvection
can be represented by a matrix of the form

we see that by choosing the hyperplane at infinity to be x1 = 0, on the affine hyperplane
x1 = 1, an elation becomes a translation.
Theorem 8.26 immediately yields the following result showing that the group of homo￾graphies PGL(E) is generated by the homologies.
Theorem 26.26. Let E be any finite-dimensional vector space over a field K of characteris￾tic not equal to 2. Then, the group of homographies PGL(E) is generated by the homologies.
When E = R
3
, we saw earlier that the involutions of RP2
have a nice structure. In
particular, if an involution has two fixed points, then it is a harmonic homology.
If dim(E) ≥ 4, it is harder to characterize the involutions of P(E), but it is possible. The
case where the linear isomorphism f : E → E defining the involutive homography h = P(f)
930 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
has no eigenvalue in the field K is quite different from the case where f has some eigenvalue
in K. In the first case, h has no fixed point. It turns out that this implies that dim(E) is
even and there is a simple description of the matrices representing an involution. If h has
some fixed point, then f is an involution of E, so it has the eigenvalues +1 and −1, and E
is the direct sum of the corresponding eigenspaces E1 and E−1. Then h can be described in
terms of P(E1) and P(E−1). For details, we refer the reader to Vienne [185] (Chapter IV,
Propositions 11 and 12).
26.12 Duality in Projective Geometry
We now consider duality in projective geometry. Given a vector space E of finite dimension
n+ 1, recall that its dual space E
∗
is the vector space of all linear forms f : E → K and that
E
∗
is isomorphic to E. We also have a canonical isomorphism between E and its bidual E
∗∗
,
which allows us to identify E and E
∗∗
.
Let H(E) denote the set of hyperplanes in P(E). In Section 26.3 we observed that the
map
p(f) 7→ P(Ker f)
is a bijection between P(E
∗
) and H(E), in which the equivalence class p(f) = {λf | λ 6 = 0}
of a nonnull linear form f ∈ E
∗
is mapped to the hyperplane P(Ker f). Using the above
bijection between P(E
∗
) and H(E), a projective subspace P(U) of P(E
∗
) (where U is a
subspace of E
∗
) can be identified with a subset of H(E), namely the family
{P(H) | H = Ker f, f ∈ U − {0}}
consisting of the projective hyperplanes in H(E) corresponding to nonnull linear forms in
U. Such subsets of H(E) are called linear systems (of hyperplanes).
The bijection between P(E
∗
) and H(E) allows us to view H(E) as a projective space,
and linear systems as projective subspaces of H(E). In the projective space H(E), a point is
a hyperplane in P(E)! The duality between subspaces of E and subspaces of E
∗
(reviewed
below) and the fact that there is a bijection between P(E
∗
) and H(E) yields a powerful
duality between the set of projective subspaces of P(E) and the set of linear systems in
H(E) (or equivalently, the set of projective subspaces of P(E
∗
)).
The idea of duality in projective geometry goes back to Gergonne and Poncelet, in the
early nineteenth century. However, Poncelet had a more restricted type of duality in mind
(polarity with respect to a conic or a quadric), whereas Gergonne had the more general idea
of the duality between points and lines (or points and planes). This more general duality
arises from a specific pairing between E and E
∗
(a nonsingular bilinear form). Here we
consider the pairing h−, −i: E
∗ × E → K, defined such that
h
f, vi = f(v),
26.12. DUALITY IN PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY 931
for all f ∈ E
∗ and all v ∈ E. Recall that given a subset V of E (respectively a subset U of
E
∗
), the orthogonal V
0 of V is the subspace of E
∗ defined such that
V
0 = {f ∈ E
∗
| hf, vi = 0, for every v ∈ V },
and that the orthogonal U
0 of U is the subspace of E defined such that
U
0 = {v ∈ E | hf, vi = 0, for every f ∈ U} =
\
f∈U
Ker f.
Then, by Theorem 11.4 (since E and E
∗ have the same finite dimension n + 1), U = U
00
,
V = V
00, and the maps
V 7→ V
0
and U 7→ U
0
are inverse bijections, where V is a subspace of E, and U is a subspace of E
∗
.
These maps set up a duality between subspaces of E and subspaces of E
∗
. Furthermore,
we know that U has dimension k iff U
0 has dimension n+ 1−k, and similarly for V and V
0
.
Since a linear system P = P(U) of hyperplanes in H(E) corresponds to a subspace U of
E
∗
, and since
U
0 =
\
f∈U
Ker f
is the intersection of all the hyperplanes defined by nonnull linear forms in U, we can view a
linear system P = P(U) = P(U
00) in H(E) as the family of hyperplanes in P(E) containing
P(U
0
).
In view of the identification of P(E
∗
) with the set H(E) of hyperplanes in P(E), by
passing to projective spaces, the above bijection between the set of subspaces of E and the
set of subspaces of E
∗ yields a bijection between the set of projective subspaces of P(E) and
the set of linear systems in H(E) (or equivalently, the set of projective subspaces of P(E
∗
))
called duality. Recall that a point of H(E) is a hyperplane in P(E).
More specifically, assuming that E has dimension n + 1, so that P(E) has dimension
n, if Q = P(V ) is any projective subspace of P(E) (where V is any subspace of E) and if
P = P(U) is any linear system in H(E) (where U is any subspace of E
∗
), we get a subspace
Q0 of H(E) defined by
Q
0 = {P(H) | Q ⊆ P(H), P(H) a hyperplane in H(E)},
and a subspace P
0 of P(E) defined by
P
0 =
\ {P(H) | P(H) ∈ P, P(H) a hyperplane in H(E)}.
We have P = P
00 and Q = Q00. Since Q0
is determined by P(V
0
), if Q = P(V ) has
dimension k (i.e., if V has dimension k + 1), then Q0 has dimension n − k − 1 (since V has
dimension k + 1 and dim(E) = n + 1, then V
0 has dimension n + 1−(k + 1) = n−k). Thus,
dim(Q) + dim(Q
0
) = n − 1,
932 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
and similarly, dim(P) + dim(P
0
) = n − 1.
A linear system P = P(U) of hyperplanes in H(E) is called a pencil of hyperplanes if it
corresponds to a projective line in P(E
∗
), which means that U is a subspace of dimension
2 of E
∗
. From dim(P) + dim(P
0
) = n − 1, a pencil of hyperplanes P is the family of
hyperplanes in H(E) containing some projective subspace P(V ) of dimension n − 2 (where
P(V ) is a projective subspace of P(E), and P(E) has dimension n). When n = 2, a pencil
of hyperplanes in H(E), also called a pencil of lines, is the family of lines passing through a
given point. When n = 3, a pencil of hyperplanes in H(E), also called a pencil of planes, is
the family of planes passing through a given line.
When n = 2, the above duality takes a rather simple form. In this case (of a projective
plane P(E)), the duality is a bijection between points in P(E) and lines in P(E
∗
), represented
by pencils of lines in H(E), with the following properties:
• A point a in P(E) maps to the line Da in P(E
∗
) represented by the pencil of lines in
H(E) containing a, also denoted by a
∗
. See Figure 26.36.
• A line D in P(E) maps to the point pD in P(E
∗
) represented by the line D in H(E).
See Figure 26.37.
• Two points a, b in P(E) map to lines Da, Db in P(E
∗
) represented by pencils of lines
through a and b, and the intersection of Da and Db is the point ph a,bi in P(E
∗
) corre￾sponding to the line h a, bi belonging to both pencils. The point ph a,bi is the image of
the line h a, bi via duality. See Figure 26.38
• A line D in P(E) containing two points a, b maps to the intersection pD of the lines Da
and Db in P(E
∗
) which are the images of a and b under duality. This is because a, b
map to lines Da, Db in P(E
∗
) represented by pencils of lines through a and b, and the
intersection of Da and Db is the point pD in P(E
∗
) corresponding to the line D = h a, bi
belonging to both pencils. The point pD is the image of the line D = h a, bi under
duality. Once again, see Figure 26.38.
• If a ∈ D, where a is a point and D is a line in P(E), then pD ∈ Da in P(E
∗
). This is
because under duality, a is mapped to the line Da in P(E
∗
) represented by the pencil
of lines containing a, and D is mapped to the point pD ∈ P(E
∗
) represented by the
line D through a in this pencil, so pD ∈ Da.
The reader will discover that the dual of Desargues’s theorem is its converse. This is
a nice way of getting the converse for free! We will not spoil the reader’s fun and let him
discover the dual of Pappus’s theorem.
In general, when n ≥ 2, the above duality is a bijection between points in P(E) and
hyperplanes in P(E
∗
), which are represented by linear systems of dimension n − 1 in H(E),
with the following properties:

• A hyperplane H in P(E) maps to the point pH in P(E

To conclude our quick tour of projective geometry, we establish a connection between the
cross-ratio of hyperplanes in a pencil of hyperplanes with the cross-ratio of the intersection
points of any line not contained in any hyperplane in this pencil with four hyperplanes in
this pencil.

26.13 Cross-Ratios of Hyperplanes
Given a pencil P = P(U) of hyperplanes in H(E), for any sequence (H1, H2, H3, H4) of
hyperplanes in this pencil, if H1, H2, H3 are distinct, we define the cross-ratio [H1, H2, H3, H4]
as the cross-ratio of the hyperplanes Hi considered as points on the projective line P in P(E
∗
).
In particular, in a projective plane P(E), given any four concurrent lines D1, D2, D3, D4,
where D1, D2, D3 are distinct, for any two distinct lines ∆ and ∆0 not passing through the
common intersection c of the lines Di
, letting di = ∆ ∩ Di
, and d
0i = ∆0 ∩ Di
, note that the
projection of center c from ∆ to ∆0 maps each di to d
0i
.
Since such a projection is a projectivity, and since projectivities between lines preserve
cross-ratios, we have
[d1, d2, d3, d4] = [d
01
, d02
, d03
, d04
],

which means that the cross-ratio of the di
is independent of the line ∆ (see Figure 26.39).
In fact, this cross-ratio is equal to [D1, D2, D3, D4], as shown in the next proposition.
Proposition 26.27. Let P = P(U) be a pencil of hyperplanes in H(E), and let ∆ = P(D)
be any projective line such that ∆ ∈/ H for all H ∈ P. The map h: P → ∆ defined such that
h(H) = H ∩ ∆ for every hyperplane H ∈ P is a projectivity. Furthermore, for any sequence
(H1, H2, H3, H4) of hyperplanes in the pencil P, if H1, H2, H3 are distinct and di = ∆ ∩ Hi,
then [d1, d2, d3, d4] = [H1, H2, H3, H4].
Proof. First, the map h: P → ∆ is well–defined, since in a projective space, every line
∆ = P(D) not contained in a hyperplane intersects this hyperplane in exactly one point.
Since P = P(U) is a pencil of hyperplanes in H(E), U has dimension 2, and let ϕ and ψ
be two nonnull linear forms in E

that constitute a basis of U, and let F = ϕ

(0). Let a = P(F) ∩ ∆ and b = P(G) ∩ ∆. There are some vectors u, v ∈ D such
that a = p(u) and b = p(v), and since ϕ and ψ are linearly independent, we have a 6 = b,
and we can choose ϕ and ψ such that ϕ(v) = −1 and ψ(u) = 1. Also, (u, v) is a basis of D.
Then a point p(αu + βv) on ∆ belongs to the hyperplane H = p(γϕ + δψ) of the pencil P iff
(γϕ + δψ)(αu + βv) = 0,
which, since ϕ(u) = 0, ψ(v) = 0, ϕ(v) = −1, and ψ(u) = 1, yields γβ = δα, which is
equivalent to [α, β] = [γ, δ] in P(K2
). But then the map h: P → ∆ is a projectivity. Letting
di = ∆ ∩ Hi
, since by Proposition 26.20 a projectivity of lines preserves the cross-ratio, we
get [d1, d2, d3, d4] = [H1, H2, H3, H4].
26.14 Complexification of a Real Projective Space
Notions such as orthogonality, angles, and distance between points are not projective con￾cepts. In order to define such notions, one needs an inner product on the underlying vector
space. We say that such notions belong to Euclidean geometry. At first glance, the fact
that some important Euclidean concepts are not covered by projective geometry seems a
major drawback of projective geometry. Fortunately, geometers of the nineteenth century
(including Laguerre, Monge, Poncelet, Chasles, von Staudt, Cayley, and Klein) found an
astute way of recovering certain Euclidean notions such as angles and orthogonality (also
circles) by embedding real projective spaces into complex projective spaces. In the next two
sections we will give a brief account of this method. More details can be found in Berger
[11, 12], Pedoe [136], Samuel [142], Coxeter [43, 44], Sidler [161], Tisseron [175], Lehmann
and Bkouche [115], and, of course, Volume II of Veblen and Young [184].
26.14. COMPLEXIFICATION OF A REAL PROJECTIVE SPACE 937
The first step is to embed a real vector space E into a complex vector space EC. A quick
but somewhat bewildering way to do so is to define the complexification of E as the tensor
product C ⊗ E. A more tangible way is to define the following structure.
Definition 26.13. Given a real vector space E, let EC be the structure E × E under the
addition operation
(u1, u2) + (v1, v2) = (u1 + v1, u2 + v2),
and let multiplication by a complex scalar z = x + iy be defined such that
(x + iy) · (u, v) = (xu − yv, yu + xv).
It is easily shown that the structure EC is a complex vector space. It is also immediate
that
(0, v) = i(v, 0),
and thus, identifying E with the subspace of EC consisting of all vectors of the form (u, 0),
we can write
(u, v) = u + iv.
Given a vector w = u + iv, its conjugate w is the vector w = u − iv. Then conjugation
is a map from EC to itself that is an involution. If (e1, . . . , en) is any basis of E, then
((e1, 0), . . . ,(en, 0)) is a basis of EC. We call such a basis a real basis.
Given a linear map f : E → E, the map f can be extended to a linear map fC : EC → EC
defined such that
fC(u + iv) = f(u) + if(v).
We define the complexification of P(E) as P(EC). If ￾ E,
−→E
 is a real affine space, we
define the complexified projective completion of ￾ E,
−→E
 as P(EbC) and denote it by EeC. Then
Ee is naturally embedded in e EC, and it is called the set of real points of e EC.
If E has dimension n+1 and (e1, . . . , en+1) is a basis of E, given any homogeneous polyno￾mial P(x1, . . . , xn+1) over C of total degree m, because P is homogeneous, it is immediately
verified that
P(x1, . . . , xn+1) = 0
iff
P(λx1, . . . , λxn+1) = 0,
for any λ 6 = 0. Thus, we can define the hypersurface V (P) of equation P(x1, . . . , xn+1) = 0 as
the subset of EeC consisting of all points of homogeneous coordinates (x1, . . . , xn+1) such that
P(x1, . . . , xn+1) = 0. We say that the hypersurface V (P) of equation P(x1, . . . , xn+1) = 0 is
real whenever P(x1, . . . , xn+1) = 0 implies that P(x1, . . . , xn+1) = 0.
938 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY

Note that a real hypersurface may have points other than real points, or no real
points at all. For example,
x
2 + y
2 − z
2 = 0
contains real and complex points such as (1, i, 0) and (1, −i, 0), and
x
2 + y
2 + z
2 = 0
contains only complex points. When m = 2 (where m is the total degree of P), a hypersurface
is called a quadric, and when m = 2 and n = 2, a conic. When m = 1, a hypersurface is
just a hyperplane.
Given any homogeneous polynomial P(x1, . . . , xn+1) over R of total degree m, since
R ⊆ C, P viewed as a homogeneous polynomial over C defines a hypersurface V (P)C in
EeC, and also a hypersurface V (P) in P(E). It is clear that V (P) is naturally embedded in
V (P)C, and V (P)C is called the complexification of V (P).
We now show how certain real quadrics without real points can be used to define orthog￾onality and angles.
26.15 Similarity Structures on a Projective Space
We begin with a real Euclidean plane ￾ E,
−→E
 . We will show that the angle of two lines D1
and D2 can be expressed as a certain cross-ratio involving the lines D1, D2 and also two
lines DI and DJ joining the intersection point D1 ∩ D2 of D1 and D2 to two complex points
at infinity I and J called the circular points. However, there is a slight problem, which is
that we haven’t yet defined the angle of two lines! Recall that we define the (oriented) angle
ud1u2 of two unit vectors u1, u2 as the equivalence class of pairs of unit vectors under the
equivalence relation defined such that
h
u1, u2i ≡ hu3, u4i
iff there is some rotation r such that r(u1) = u3 and r(u2) = u4. The set of (oriented) angles
of vectors is a group isomorphic to the group SO(2) of plane rotations. If the Euclidean
plane is oriented, the measure of the angle of two vectors is defined up to 2kπ (k ∈ Z). The
angle of two vectors has a measure that is either θ or 2π − θ, where θ ∈ [0, 2π[ , depending
on the orientation of the plane. The problem with lines is that they are not oriented: A line
is defined by a point a and a vector u, but also by a and −u. Given any two lines D1 and
D2, if r is a rotation of angle θ such that r(D1) = D2, note that the rotation −r of angle
θ + π also maps D1 onto D2. Thus, in order to define the (oriented) angle\ D1D2 of two lines
D1, D2, we define an equivalence relation on pairs of lines as follows:
h
D1, D2i ≡ hD3, D4i
26.15. SIMILARITY STRUCTURES ON A PROJECTIVE SPACE 939
if there is some rotation r such that r(D1) = D2 and r(D3) = D4.
It can be verified that the set of (oriented) angles of lines is a group isomorphic to the
quotient group SO(2)/{id, −id}, also denoted by PSO(2). In order to define the measure
of the angle of two lines, the Euclidean plane E must be oriented. The measure of the angle \
D1D2 of two lines is defined up to kπ (k ∈ Z). The angle of two lines has a measure that is
either θ or π − θ, where θ ∈ [0, π[ , depending on the orientation of the plane. We now go
back to the circular points.
Let (a0, a1, a2, a3) be any projective frame for EeC such that (a0, a1) arises from an or￾thonormal basis (u1, u2) of −→E and the line at infinity H corresponds to z = 0 (where (x, y, z)
are the homogeneous coordinates of a point w.r.t. (a0, a1, a2, a3)). Consider the points
belonging to the intersection of the real conic Σ of equation
x
2 + y
2 − z
2 = 0
with the line at infinity z = 0. For such points, x
2 + y
2 = 0 and z = 0, and since
x
2 + y
2 = (y − ix)(y + ix),
we get exactly two points I and J of homogeneous coordinates (1, −i, 0) and (1, i, 0). The
points I and J are called the circular points, or the absolute points, of EeC. They are complex
points at infinity. Any line containing either I or J is called an isotropic line.
What is remarkable about I and J is that they allow the definition of the angle of two
lines in terms of a certain cross-ratio. Indeed, consider two distinct real lines D1 and D2 in
E, and let DI and DJ be the isotropic lines joining D1∩D2 to I and J. We will compute the
cross-ratio [D1, D2, DI , DJ ]. For this, we simply have to compute the cross-ratio of the four
points obtained by intersecting D1, D2, DI , DJ with any line not passing through D1 ∩ D2.
By changing frame if necessary, so that D1 ∩ D2 = a0, we can assume that the equations of
the lines D1, D2, DI , DJ are of the form
y = m1x,
y = m2x,
y = −ix,
y = ix,
leaving the cases m1 = ∞ and m2 = ∞ as a simple exercise. If we choose z = 0 as
the intersecting line, we need to compute the cross-ratio of the points (D1)∞ = (1, m1, 0),
(D2)∞ = (1, m2, 0), I = (1, −i, 0), and J = (1, i, 0), and we get
[D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = [(D1)∞,(D2)∞, I, J] = (−i − m1)
(i − m1)
(i − m2)
(−i − m2)
,
that is,
[D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = m1m2 + 1 + i(m2 − m1)
m1m2 + 1 − i(m2 − m1)
.
940 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
However, since m1 and m2 are the slopes of the lines D1 and D2, it is well known that if θ
is the (oriented) angle between D1 and D2, then
tan θ =
m2 − m1
m1m2 + 1
.
Thus, we have
[D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = m1m2 + 1 + i(m2 − m1)
m1m2 + 1 − i(m2 − m1)
=
1 + itan θ
1 − itan θ
,
that is,
[D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = cos 2θ + isin 2θ = e
i2θ
.
One can check that the formula still holds when m1 = ∞ or m2 = ∞, and also when
D1 = D2. The formula
[D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = e
i2θ
is known as Laguerre’s formula.
If U denotes the group {e
iθ | −π ≤ θ ≤ π} of complex numbers of modulus 1, recall that
the map Λ: R → U defined such that
Λ(t) = e
it
is a group homomorphism such that Λ−1
(1) = 2kπ, where k ∈ Z. The restriction
Λ: ] − π, π[ → (U − {−1})
of Λ to ] − π, π[ is a bijection, and its inverse will be denoted by
logU : (U − {−1}) → ] − π, π[ .
For stating Proposition 26.28 more conveniently, we extend logU to U by letting logU (−1) =
π, even though the resulting function is not continuous at −1!. Then we can write
θ =
1
2
logU ([D1, D2, DI , DJ ]).
If the orientation of the plane E is reversed, θ becomes π − θ, and since
e
i2(π−θ) = e
2iπ−i2θ = e
−i2θ
,
logU (e
i2(π−θ)
) = − logU (e
i2θ
), and
θ = −
1
2
logU ([D1, D2, DI , DJ ]).
In all cases, we have
θ =
1
2
| logU ([D1, D2, DI , DJ ])|,
a formula due to Cayley. We summarize the above in the following proposition.
26.15. SIMILARITY STRUCTURES ON A PROJECTIVE SPACE 941
Proposition 26.28. Given any two lines D1, D2 in a real Euclidean plane ￾ E,
−→E
 , letting
DI and DJ be the isotropic lines in e EC joining the intersection point D1 ∩ D2 of D1 and D2
to the circular points I and J, if θ is the angle of the two lines D1, D2, we have
[D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = e
i2θ
,
known as Laguerre’s formula, and independently of the orientation of the plane, we have
θ =
1
2
| logU ([D1, D2, DI , DJ ])|,
known as Cayley’s formula.
In particular, note that θ = π/2 iff [D1, D2, DI , DJ ] = −1, that is, if (D1, D2, DI , DJ )
forms a harmonic division. Thus, two lines D1 and D2 are orthogonal iff they form a harmonic
division with DI and DJ .
The above considerations show that it is not necessary to assume that ￾ E,
−→E
 is a real
Euclidean plane to define the angle of two lines and orthogonality. Instead, it is enough to
assume that two complex conjugate points I, J on the line H at infinity are given. We say
that h I, Ji provides a similarity structure on EeC. Note in passing that a circle can be defined
as a conic in EeC that contains the circular points I, J. Indeed, the equation of a conic is of
the form
ax2 + by2 + cxy + dxz + eyz + fz2 = 0.
If this conic contains the circular points I = (1, −i, 0) and J = (1, i, 0), we get the two
equations
a − b − ic = 0,
a − b + ic = 0,
from which we get 2ic = 0 and a = b, that is, c = 0 and a = b. The resulting equation
ax2 + ay2 + dxz + eyz + fz2 = 0
is indeed that of a circle.
Instead of using the function logU : (U − {−1}) → ] − π, π[ as logarithm, one may use
the complex logarithm function log: C
∗ → B, where C
∗ = C − {0} and
B = {x + iy | x, y ∈ R, −π < y ≤ π}.
Indeed, the restriction of the complex exponential function z 7→ e
z
to B is bijective, and thus,
log is well-defined on C
∗
(note that log is a homeomorphism from C − {x | x ∈ R, x ≤ 0}
onto {x + iy | x, y ∈ R, −π < y < π}, the interior of B). Then Cayley’s formula reads as
θ =
1
2i
log([D1, D2, DI , DJ ]),
942 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
with a ± in front when the plane is nonoriented. Observe that this formula allows the
definition of the angle of two complex lines (possibly a complex number) and the notion of
orthogonality of complex lines. In this case, note that the isotropic lines are orthogonal to
themselves!
The definition of orthogonality of two lines D1, D2 in terms of (D1, D2, DI , DJ ) forming
a harmonic division can be used to give elegant proofs of various results. Cayley’s formula
can even be used in computer vision to explain modeling and calibrating cameras! (see
Faugeras [59]). As an illustration, consider a triangle (a, b, c), and recall that the line a
0
passing through a and orthogonal to (b, c) is called the altitude of a, and similarly for b
and c. It is well known that the altitudes a
0 , b0 , c0 intersect in a common point called the
orthocenter of the triangle (a, b, c). This can be shown in a number of ways using the circular
points. Indeed, letting bc∞, ab∞, ac∞, a0∞, b
0∞, and c
0∞ denote the points at infinity of the
lines h b, ci ,h a, bi , h a, ci , a
0 , b0 , and c
0 , we have
[bc∞, a0∞, I, J] = −1, [ab∞, c0∞, I, J] = −1, [ac∞, b0∞, I, J] = −1,
and it is easy to show that there is an involution σ of the line at infinity such that
σ(I) = J,
σ(J) = I,
σ(bc∞) = a
0∞,
σ(ab∞) = c
0∞,
σ(ac∞) = b
0∞.
Then, it can be shown that the lines a
0 , b0 , c0 are concurrent. For more details and other
results, notably on the conics, see Sidler [161], Berger [12], and Samuel [142].
The generalization of what we just did to real Euclidean spaces ￾ E,
−→E
 of dimension n
is simple. Let (a0, . . . , an+1) be any projective frame for e EC such that (a0, . . . , an−1) arises
from an orthonormal basis (u1, . . . , un) of −→E and the hyperplane at infinity H corresponds
to xn+1 = 0 (where (x1, . . . , xn+1) are the homogeneous coordinates of a point with respect
to (a0, . . . , an+1)). Consider the points belonging to the intersection of the real quadric Σ of
equation
x
2
1 + · · · + x
2
n − x
2
n+1 = 0
with the hyperplane at infinity xn+1 = 0. For such points,
x
2
1 + · · · + x
2
n = 0 and xn+1 = 0.
Such points belong to a quadric called the absolute quadric of EeC, and denoted by Ω. Any
line containing any point on the absolute quadric is called an isotropic line. Then, given any
two coplanar lines D1 and D2 in E, these lines intersect the hyperplane at infinity H in two
points (D1)∞ and (D2)∞, and the line ∆ joining (D1)∞ and (D2)∞ intersects the absolute
26.15. SIMILARITY STRUCTURES ON A PROJECTIVE SPACE 943
quadric Ω in two conjugate points I∆ and J∆ (also called circular points). It can be shown
that the angle θ between D1 and D2 is defined by Laguerre’s formula:
[(D1)∞,(D2)∞, I∆, J∆] = [D1, D2, DI∆
, DJ∆
] = e
i2θ
,
where DI∆
and DJ∆
are the lines joining the intersection D1∩D2 of D1 and D2 to the circular
points I∆ and J∆.
As in the case of a plane, the above considerations show that it is not necessary to assume
that ￾ E,
−→E
 is a real Euclidean space to define the angle of two lines and orthogonality.
Instead, it is enough to assume that a nondegenerate real quadric Ω in the hyperplane at
infinity H and without real points is given. In particular, when n = 3, the absolute quadric
Ω is a nondegenerate real conic consisting of complex points at infinity. We say that Ω
provides a similarity structure on EeC.
It is also possible to show that the real projectivities of EeC that leave both the hyperplane
H at infinity and the absolute quadric Ω (globally) invariant form a group which is none
other than the group of affine similarities; see Lehmann and Bkouche [115] (Chapter 10, page
321), and Berger [11] (Chapter 8, Proposition 8.8.6.4).
Definition 26.14. Let (E,
−→E ,h−, −i) be a Euclidean affine space of finite dimension. An
affine similarity of (E,
−→E ) is an invertible affine map f ∈ GA(E) such that if −→f is the
linear map associated with f, then there is some positive real ρ > 0 satisfying the condition



−→f (u)

 = ρ k uk for all u ∈
−→E . The number ρ is called the ratio of the affine similarity f.
If f ∈ GA(E) is an affine similarity of ratio ρ, let −→g = ρ
−1−→f . Since ρ > 0, we have
k
−→g (u)k =

  ρ
−1−→f (u)

 = ρ
−1
 
 −→f (u)

 = ρ

ρ k uk = k uk
for all u ∈
−→E , and by Proposition 12.12, the map −→g = ρ
−1−→f is an isometry; that is,
−→g ∈ O(E).
Consequently, every affine similarity f of E can be written as the composition of an
isometry (a member of O(E)), a central dilatation, and a translation. For example, when
n = 2, a similarity is a transformation of the form

with  = ±1 and a, b, c, c0 ∈ R. We have the following result showing that the affine similar￾ities of the plane can be viewed as special kinds of projectivities of CP2
.
Proposition 26.29. If a projectivity h of CP2
leaves the set of circular points {I, J} fixed
and maps the affine space R
2
into itself (where R
2
is viewed as the subspace of all points
(x, y, 1) with x, y ∈ R), then h is an affine similarity.
944 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
Proof. The fact that h leaves the set of circular points {I, J} fixed means that either h(I) = I
and h(J) = J or h(I) = J and h(J) = I. If we define I
0 and J
0 by
I
0 = (1, −i, 0) and J
0 = (1, i, 0)
where  = ±1, then the fact that h leaves the set of circular points {I, J} fixed is equivalent
to
h(I) = I
0 and h(J) = J
0 .
Assume that h is represented by the invertible matrix
A =


a a0 a
00
b b0 b
00
c c0 c
00

 .
Then h(I) = I
0 and h(J) = J
0 means that there is some nonzero scalars λ, µ ∈ C such


a a0 a
00
b b0 b

c c0 c



We obtain the following equations:
λ = a − ia0 µ = a + ia0
−λi = b − ib0 µi = b + ib0
0 = c + ic0 0 = c − ic0 .
By adding the two equations on the first row we obtain
λ + µ = 2a,
by subtracting the first equation from the second on the second row we obtain
(λ + µ)i = 2ib0 ,
so we get
b
0 = a.
By subtracting the first equation from the second on the first row we obtain
µ − λ = 2ia0 ,
and by adding the equations on the second row we obtain
(µ − λ)i = 2b,
26.15. SIMILARITY STRUCTURES ON A PROJECTIVE SPACE 945
and since  = ±1, we have  2 = 1, so we get
a
0 = −b.
By adding and subtracting the equations on the third row we obtain
c = c
0 = 0.
Since A is invertible, c
00 6 = 0, and since A is determined up to a nonzero scalar we may
assume that c
00 = 1, and we conclude that
A =


a −b a00



If h maps R



must be real for all x, y ∈ R, which implies that a, b, a00 , b00 ∈ R.
The following proposition from Berger [11] (Chapter 8, Proposition 8.8.5.1) gives a con￾venient characterization of the affine similarities.
Proposition 26.30. Let (E,
−→E ,h−, −i) be a Euclidean affine space of finite dimension n ≥
2. An affine map f ∈ GA(E) is an affine similarity iff −→f preserves orthogonality; that is,
for any two vectors u, v ∈
−→E , if h u, vi = 0, then h
−→f (u),
−→f (v)i = 0.
Proof. Assume that f ∈ GA(E) is an affine map such that for any two vectors u, v ∈
−→E , if
h
u, vi = 0, then h
−→f (u),
−→f (v)i = 0. Fix any nonzero u ∈
−→E and consider the linear form ϕu
given by
ϕu(v) = h −→f (u),
−→f (v)i , v ∈
−→E .
Since −→f is invertible, ϕu(u) 6 = 0. For any v ∈
−→E such that h u, vi = 0, we have
ϕu(v) = h −→f (u),
−→f (v)i = 0,
thus ϕu is a nonzero linear form vanishing on the hyperplane H orthogonal to u, which is
the kernel of the linear form v 7→ hu, vi . Therefore, there is some nonzero scalar ρ(u) ∈ R
such that
ϕu(v) = ρ(u)h u, vi for all v ∈
−→E .
Evaluating ϕu at u, we see that ρ(u) > 0. If we can show that ρ(u) is a constant ρ > 0
independent of u, we will have shown that
h
