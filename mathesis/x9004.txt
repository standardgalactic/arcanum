Definition 39.5. The matrix J(f)(a) is called the Jacobian matrix of Df at a. When
m = n, the determinant, det(J(f)(a)), of J(f)(a) is called the Jacobian of Df(a).
From a previous result, we know that this determinant in fact only depends on Df(a),
and not on specific bases. However, partial derivatives give a means for computing it.
When E = R
n and F = R
m, for any function f : R
n → R
m, it is easy to compute the
partial derivatives ∂fi
∂xj
(a). We simply treat the function fi
: R
n → R as a function of its j-th
argument, leaving the others fixed, and compute the derivative as in Definition 39.1, that is,
the usual derivative.
Example 39.3. For example, consider the function f : R
2 → R
2
, defined such that
f(r, θ) = (r cos(θ), r sin(θ)).
39.3. JACOBIAN MATRICES 1423
Then, we have
J(f)(r, θ) =  cos(
sin(θ
θ
)
) −
r
r
cos(
sin(
θ
θ
)
)

and the Jacobian (determinant) has value det(J(f)(r, θ)) = r.
In the case where E = R (or E = C), for any function f : R → F (or f : C → F), the
Jacobian matrix of Df(a) is a column vector. In fact, this column vector is just D1f(a).
Then, for every λ ∈ R (or λ ∈ C),
Df(a)(λ) = λD1f(a).
This case is sufficiently important to warrant a definition.
Definition 39.6. Given a function f : R → F (or f : C → F), where F is a normed affine
space, the vector
Df(a)(1) = D1f(a)
is called the vector derivative or velocity vector (in the real case) at a. We usually identify
Df(a) with its Jacobian matrix D1f(a), which is the column vector corresponding to D1f(a).
By abuse of notation, we also let Df(a) denote the vector Df(a)(1) = D1f(a).
When E = R, the physical interpretation is that f defines a (parametric) curve that is
the trajectory of some particle moving in R
m as a function of time, and the vector D1f(a)
is the velocity of the moving particle f(t) at t = a.
It is often useful to consider functions f : [a, b] → F from a closed interval [a, b] ⊆ R to a
normed affine space F, and its derivative Df(a) on [a, b], even though [a, b] is not open. In
this case, as in the case of a real-valued function, we define the right derivative D1f(a+) at
a, and the left derivative D1f(b−) at b, and we assume their existence.

Example 39.5. Consider the quadratic function f : R

where A is a real n × n symmetric matrix. We claim that
dfu(h) = 2u

Since A is symmetric, we have
f(u + h) = (u

= u
> Au + u
> Ah + h
> Au + h

= u
> Au + 2u
> Ah + h

so we have
f(u + h) − f(u) − 2u
> Ah = h
> Ah.
If we write

n
,
1426 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
as claimed. This formula shows that the gradient ∇fu of f at u is given by
∇fu = 2Au.
As a first corollary we obtain the gradient of a function of the form
f(x) = 1
2
x
> Ax − b
> x,
where A is a symmetric n × n matrix and b is some vector b ∈ R
n
. Since the derivative of a
linear function is itself, we obtain
dfu(h) = u
> Ah − b
> h,
and the gradient of f is given by
∇fu = Au − b.
As a second corollary we obtain the gradient of the function
f(x) = k Ax − bk
2
2 = (Ax − b)
> (Ax − b) = (x
> A
> − b
> )(Ax − b)
which is the function to minimize in a least squares problem, where A is an m × n matrix.
We have
f(x) = x
> A
> Ax − x
> A
> b − b
> Ax + b
> b = x
> A
> Ax − 2b
> Ax + b
> b,
and since the derivative of a constant function is 0 and the derivative of a linear function is
itself, we get
dfu(h) = 2u
> A
> Ah − 2b
> Ah.
Consequently, the gradient of f is given by
∇fu = 2A
> Au − 2A
> b.

Given two normed affine spaces E and F of finite dimension, given an open subset A of
E, if a function f : A → F is differentiable at a ∈ A, then its Jacobian matrix is well defined.

One should be warned that the converse is false. There are functions such that all the
partial derivatives exist at some a ∈ A, but yet, the function is not differentiable at a,
and not even continuous at a. For example, consider the function f : R
2 → R, defined such
that f(0, 0) = 0, and
f(x, y) = x
2
y
x
4 + y
2
if (x, y) 6 = (0, 0).
For any u 6 = 0, letting u =

h
k

, we have
f(0 + tu) − f(0)
t
=
h
2k
t
2h
4 + k
2
,
so that
Duf(0, 0) = 
h
2
k
if k 6 = 0
0 if k = 0.
Thus, Duf(0, 0) exists for all u 6 = 0. On the other hand, if Df(0, 0) existed, it would be
a linear map Df(0, 0): R
2 → R represented by a row matrix (α β), and we would have
Duf(0, 0) = Df(0, 0)(u) = αh + βk, but the explicit formula for Duf(0, 0) is not linear. As
a matter of fact, the function f is not continuous at (0, 0). For example, on the parabola
y = x
2
, f(x, y) = 2
1
, and when we approach the origin on this parabola, the limit is 1
2
, when
in fact, f(0, 0) = 0.
However, there are sufficient conditions on the partial derivatives for Df(a) to exist,
namely, continuity of the partial derivatives.
1428 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
If f is differentiable on A, then f defines a function Df : A → L(
−→E ;
−→F ). It turns out
that the continuity of the partial derivatives on A is a necessary and sufficient condition for
Df to exist and to be continuous on A.
If f : [a, b] → R is a function which is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b),
then there is some c with a < c < b such that
f(b) − f(a) = (b − a)f
0 (c).
This result is known as the mean value theorem and is a generalization of Rolle’s theorem,
which corresponds to the case where f(a) = f(b).
Unfortunately, the mean value theorem fails for vector-valued functions. For example,
the function f : [0, 2π] → R
2 given by
f(t) = (cost,sin t)
is such that f(2π) − f(0) = (0, 0), yet its derivative f
0 (t) = (− sin t, cost) does not vanish in
(0, 2π).
A suitable generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is possible
if we consider an inequality (an upper bound) instead of an equality. This generalized version
of the mean value theorem plays an important role in the proof of several major results of
differential calculus.
If E is an affine space (over R or C), given any two points a, b ∈ E, the closed segment
[a, b] is the set of all points a + λ(b − a), where 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, λ ∈ R, and the open segment
(a, b) is the set of all points a + λ(b − a), where 0 < λ < 1, λ ∈ R.
Proposition 39.12. Let E and F be two normed affine spaces, let A be an open subset of
E, and let f : A → F be a continuous function on A. Given any a ∈ A and any h 6 = 0 in
−→E , if the closed segment [a, a + h] is contained in A, if f : A → F is differentiable at every
point of the open segment (a, a + h), and
sup
x∈(a,a+h)
k
Df(x)k ≤ M,
for some M ≥ 0, then
k
f(a + h) − f(a)k ≤ Mk hk .
As a corollary, if L:
−→E →
−→F is a continuous linear map, then
k
f(a + h) − f(a) − L(h)k ≤ Mk hk ,
where M = supx∈(a,a+h) k Df(x) − Lk .
The above proposition is sometimes called the “mean value theorem.” Proposition 39.12
can be used to show the following important result.
39.4. THE IMPLICIT AND THE INVERSE FUNCTION THEOREMS 1429
Theorem 39.13. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, where E is of finite dimension
n, and where (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) is a frame of E, given any open subset A of E, given any
function f : A → F, the derivative Df : A → L(
−→E ;
−→F ) is defined and continuous on A iff
every partial derivative ∂jf (or ∂f
∂xj
) is defined and continuous on A, for all j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
As a corollary, if F is of finite dimension m, and (b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) is a frame of F, the
derivative Df : A → L(
−→E ;
−→F ) is defined and continuous on A iff every partial derivative
∂jfi (or ∂fi
∂xj
) is defined and continuous on A, for all i, j, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
Theorem 39.13 gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and continuity
of the derivative of a function on an open set. It should be noted that a more general version
of Theorem 39.13 holds, assuming that E = (E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (En, an), or E = E1 × · · · × En,
and using the more general partial derivatives Djf introduced before Proposition 39.11.
Definition 39.7. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, and an open subset A of E, we
say that a function f : A → F is of class C
0 on A or a C
0
-function on A if f is continuous
on A. We say that f : A → F is of class C
1 on A or a C
1
-function on A if Df exists and is
continuous on A.
Since the existence of the derivative on an open set implies continuity, a C
1
-function
is of course a C
0
-function. Theorem 39.13 gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a
function f to be a C
1
-function (when E is of finite dimension). It is easy to show that the
composition of C
1
-functions (on appropriate open sets) is a C
1
-function.
39.4 The Implicit and The Inverse Function Theorems
Given three normed affine spaces E, F, and G, given a function f : E × F → G, given any
c ∈ G, it may happen that the equation
f(x, y) = c
has the property that, for some open sets A ⊆ E, and B ⊆ F, there is a function g : A → B,
such that
f(x, g(x)) = c,
for all x ∈ A. Such a situation is usually very rare, but if some solution (a, b) ∈ E × F
such that f(a, b) = c is known, under certain conditions, for some small open sets A ⊆ E
containing a and B ⊆ F containing b, the existence of a unique g : A → B, such that
f(x, g(x)) = c,
for all x ∈ A, can be shown. Under certain conditions, it can also be shown that g is
continuous, and differentiable. Such a theorem, known as the implicit function theorem, can
be proven.

We now state a very general version of the implicit function theorem. The proof of
this theorem is fairly involved and uses a fixed-point theorem for contracting mappings in
complete metric spaces; it is given in Schwartz [151]. Other proofs can be found in Lang
[111] and Cartan [34].
Theorem 39.14. Let E, F, and G, be normed affine spaces, let Ω be an open subset of
E × F, let f : Ω → G be a function defined on Ω, let (a, b) ∈ Ω, let c ∈ G, and assume that
f(a, b) = c. If the following assumptions hold
(1) The function f : Ω → G is continuous on Ω;
(2) F is a complete normed affine space (and so is G);
(3) ∂f
∂y (x, y) exists for every (x, y) ∈ Ω, and ∂f

then the following properties hold:
(a) There exist some open subset A ⊆ E containing a and some open subset B ⊆ F
containing b, such that A × B ⊆ Ω, and for every x ∈ A, the equation f(x, y) = c has
a single solution y = g(x), and thus, there is a unique function g : A → B such that
f(x, g(x)) = c, for all x ∈ A;

(b) The function g : A → B is continuous.
If we also assume that

is given by its Jacobian matrix as
df(a,b) =

Condition (5) holds, and clearly, Condition (6) also holds.
Theorem 39.14 implies that there is some open subset A of R

containing a, some open
subset B of R containing b, and a unique function g : A → B such that
f(x, g(x)) = 0

are
two differentiable parametrizations of the sphere, but the union of their ranges does not cover
the entire sphere. Since b 6 = 0, none of the points on the unit circle in the (x1, x2)-plane are
covered. Our function f views b as lying on the x3-axis. In order to cover the entire sphere
using this method, we need four more maps, which correspond to b lying on the x1-axis or
on the x2 axis. Then we get the additional (implicit) maps (x2, x3) 7→ ±p 1 − x

The implicit function theorem plays an important role in the calculus of variations.
We now consider another very important notion, that of a (local) diffeomorphism.
Definition 39.8. Given two topological spaces E and F, and an open subset A of E, we
say that a function f : A → F is a local homeomorphism from A to F if for every a ∈ A,
there is an open set U ⊆ A containing a and an open set V containing f(a) such that f is a
homeomorphism from U to V = f(U). If B is an open subset of F, we say that f : A → F
is a (global) homeomorphism from A to B if f is a homeomorphism from A to B = f(A).
If E and F are normed affine spaces, we say that f : A → F is a local diffeomorphism from
A to F if for every a ∈ A, there is an open set U ⊆ A containing a and an open set V
containing f(a) such that f is a bijection from U to V , f is a C
1
-function on U, and f
−1
is a C
1
-function on V = f(U). We say that f : A → F is a (global) diffeomorphism from A
to B if f is a homeomorphism from A to B = f(A), f is a C
1
-function on A, and f
−1
is a
C
1
-function on B.
Note that a local diffeomorphism is a local homeomorphism. Also, as a consequence of
Proposition 39.8, if f is a diffeomorphism on A, then Df(a) is a linear isomorphism for every
a ∈ A. The following theorem can be shown. In fact, there is a fairly simple proof using
Theorem 39.14.
39.4. THE IMPLICIT AND THE INVERSE FUNCTION THEOREMS 1433
Theorem 39.15. (Inverse Function Theorem) Let E and F be complete normed affine
spaces, let A be an open subset of E, and let f : A → F be a C
1
-function on A. The
following properties hold:
(1) For every a ∈ A, if Df(a) is a linear isomorphism (which means that both Df(a)
and (Df(a))−1 are linear and continuous),2
then there exist some open subset U ⊆ A
containing a, and some open subset V of F containing f(a), such that f is a diffeo￾morphism from U to V = f(U). Furthermore,
Df
−1
(f(a)) = (Df(a))−1
.
For every neighborhood N of a, its image f(N) is a neighborhood of f(a), and for every
open ball U ⊆ A of center a, its image f(U) contains some open ball of center f(a).
(2) If Df(a) is invertible for every a ∈ A, then B = f(A) is an open subset of F, and
f is a local diffeomorphism from A to B. Furthermore, if f is injective, then f is a
diffeomorphism from A to B.
Proofs of the inverse function theorem can be found in Schwartz [151], Lang [111], Abra￾ham and Marsden [1], and Cartan [34].
The idea of Schwartz’s proof is that if we define the function f1 : F × Ω → F by
f1(y, z) = f(z) − y,
then an inverse g = f
−1 of f is an implicit solution of the equation f1(y, z) = 0, since
f1(y, g(y)) = f(g(y)) − y = 0. Observe that the roles of E and F are switched, but this is
not a problem since F is complete. The proof consists in checking that the conditions of
Theorem 39.14 apply.
Part (1) of Theorem 39.15 is often referred to as the “(local) inverse function theorem.”
It plays an important role in the study of manifolds and (ordinary) differential equations.
If E and F are both of finite dimension, and some frames have been chosen, the in￾vertibility of Df(a) is equivalent to the fact that the Jacobian determinant det(J(f)(a))
is nonnull. The case where Df(a) is just injective or just surjective is also important for
defining manifolds, using implicit definitions.
Definition 39.9. Let E and F be normed affine spaces, where E and F are of finite dimen￾sion (or both E and F are complete), and let A be an open subset of E. For any a ∈ A, a
C
1
-function f : A → F is an immersion at a if Df(a) is injective. A C
1
-function f : A → F
is a submersion at a if Df(a) is surjective. A C
1
-function f : A → F is an immersion on A
(resp. a submersion on A) if Df(a) is injective (resp. surjective) for every a ∈ A.
2Actually, since E and F are Banach spaces, by the Open Mapping Theorem, it is sufficient to assume
that Df(a) is continuous and bijective; see Lang [111].
1434 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
When E and F are finite dimensional with dim(E) = n and dim(F) = m, if m ≥ n,
then f is an immersion iff the Jacobian matrix, J(f)(a), has full rank n for all a ∈ E and
if n ≥ m, then f is a submersion iff the Jacobian matrix, J(f)(a), has full rank m for all
a ∈ E.
Example 39.8. For example, f : R → R
2 defined by f(t) = (cos(t),sin(t)) is an immersion
since J(f)(t) =  −

sin(
t)


has rank 1 for all t. On the other hand, f : R → R
2 defined by
f(t) = (t

, t2
) is not an immersion since J(f)(t) =  2

vanishes at t = 0. See Figure 39.6.
An example of a submersion is given by the projection map f : R
2 → R, where f(x, y) = x,
since J(f)(x, y) = ￾ 1 0 .

Figure 39.6: Figure (i.) is the immersion of R into R
2 given by f(t) = (cos(t),sin(t)). Figure
(ii.), the parametric curve f(t) = (t

the origin.
The following results can be shown.
Proposition 39.16. Let A be an open subset of R

, and let f : A → R
m be a function.
For every a ∈ A, f : A → R
m is a submersion at a iff there exists an open subset U of A
containing a, an open subset W ⊆ R
n−m, and a diffeomorphism ϕ: U → f(U) × W, such
that,
f = π1 ◦ ϕ,
