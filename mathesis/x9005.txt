39.5 Tangent Spaces and Differentials
In this section, we discuss briefly a geometric interpretation of the notion of derivative. We
consider sets of points defined by a differentiable function. This is a special case of the notion
of a (differential) manifold.
Given two normed affine spaces E and F, let A be an open subset of E, and let f : A → F
be a function.
Definition 39.10. Given f : A → F as above, its graph Γ(f) is the set of all points
Γ(f) = {(x, y) ∈ E × F | x ∈ A, y = f(x)}.
If Df is defined on A, we say that Γ(f) is a differential submanifold of E × F of equation
y = f(x).
It should be noted that this is a very particular kind of differential manifold.
Example 39.9. If E = R and F = R
2
, letting f = (g, h), where g : R → R and h: R → R,
Γ(f) is a curve in R
3
, of equations y = g(x), z = h(x). When E = R
2 and F = R, Γ(f) is a
surface in R
3
, of equation z = f(x, y).
39.5. TANGENT SPACES AND DIFFERENTIALS 1437
We now define the notion of affine tangent space in a very general way. Next, we will see
what it means for manifolds Γ(f), as in Definition 39.10.
Definition 39.11. Given a normed affine space E, given any nonempty subset M of E,
given any point a ∈ M, we say that a vector u ∈
−→E is tangent at a to M if there exist a
sequence (an)n∈N of points in M converging to a, and a sequence (λn)n∈N, with λi ∈ R and
λn ≥ 0, such that the sequence (λn(an − a))n∈N converges to u.
The set of all vectors tangent at a to M is called the family of tangent vectors at a to
M and the set of all points of E of the form a + u where u belongs to the family of tangent
vectors at a to M is called the affine tangent family at a to M.
Clearly, 0 is always tangent, and if u is tangent, then so is every λu, for λ ∈ R, λ ≥ 0. If
u 6 = 0, then the sequence (λn)n∈N must tend towards +∞. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 39.18. Let E and F be two normed affine spaces, let A be an open subset of
E, let a ∈ A, and let f : A → F be a function. If Df(a) exists, then the family of tangent
vectors at (a, f(a)) to Γ is a subspace Ta(Γ) of −→E ×
−→F , defined by the condition (equation)
(u, v) ∈ Ta(Γ) iff v = Df(a)(u),
and the affine tangent family at (a, f(a)) to Γ is an affine variety Ta(Γ) of E × F, defined
by the condition (equation)
(x, y) ∈ Ta(Γ) iff y = f(a) + Df(a)(x − a),
where Γ is the graph of f.
The proof is actually rather simple. We have Ta(Γ) = a + Ta(Γ), and since Ta(Γ) is a
subspace of −→E ×
−→F , the set Ta(Γ) is an affine variety. Thus, the affine tangent space at a
point (a, f(a)) is a familar object, a line, a plane, etc.
As an illustration, when E = R
2 and F = R, the affine tangent plane at the point (a, b, c)
to the surface of equation z = f(x, y), is defined by the equation
z = c +
∂f
∂x(a, b)(x − a) + ∂f
∂y (a, b)(y − b).
If E = R and F = R
2
, the tangent line at (a, b, c), to the curve of equations y = g(x),
z = h(x), is defined by the equations
y = b + Dg(a)(x − a),
z = c + Dh(a)(x − a).
Thus, derivatives and partial derivatives have the desired intended geometric interpreta￾tion as tangent spaces. Of course, in order to deal with this topic properly, we really would
have to go deeper into the study of (differential) manifolds.
We now briefly consider second-order and higher-order derivatives.
1438 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
39.6 Second-Order and Higher-Order Derivatives
Given two normed affine spaces E and F, and some open subset A of E, if Df(a) is defined
for every a ∈ A, then we have a mapping Df : A → L(
−→E ;
−→F ). Since L(
−→E ;
−→F ) is a normed
vector space, if Df exists on an open subset U of A containing a, we can consider taking the
derivative of Df at some a ∈ A.
Definition 39.12. Given a function f : A → F defined on some open subset A of E
such that Df(a) is defined for every a ∈ A, If D(Df)(a) exists for every a ∈ A, we
get a mapping D2
f : A → L(
−→E ;L(
−→E ;
−→F )) called the second derivative of f on A, where
D2
f(a) = D(Df)(a), for every a ∈ A.
As in the case of the first derivative Dfa where Dfa(u) = Duf(a), where Duf(a) is the
directional derivative of f at a in the direction u, it would be useful to express D2
f(a)(u)(v)
in terms of two directional derivatives. This can indeed be done. If D2
f(a) exists, then for
every u ∈
−→E ,
D
2
f(a)(u) = D(Df)(a)(u) = Du(Df)(a) ∈ L(
−→E ;
−→F ).
We have the following result.
Proposition 39.19. If D2
f(a) exists, then Du(Dvf)(a) exists and
D
2
f(a)(u)(v) = Du(Dvf)(a), for all u, v ∈
−→E .
Proof. Recall from Proposition 37.61, that the map app from L(
−→E ;
−→F ) ×
−→E to
−→F , defined
such that for every L ∈ L(
−→E ;
−→F ), for every v ∈
−→E ,
app(L, v) = L(v),
is a continuous bilinear map. Thus, in particular, given a fixed v ∈
−→E , the linear map
appv
: L(
−→E ;
−→F ) →
−→F , defined such that appv
(L) = L(v), is a continuous map.
Also recall from Proposition 39.7, that if h: A → G is a function such that Dh(a) exits,
and k : G → H is a continuous linear map, then, D(k ◦ h)(a) exists, and
k(Dh(a)(u)) = D(k ◦ h)(a)(u),
that is,
k(Duh(a)) = Du(k ◦ h)(a),
Applying these two facts to h = Df, and to k = appv
, we have
Du(Df)(a)(v) = Du(appv ◦ Df)(a).
But (appv ◦ Df)(x) = Df(x)(v) = Dvf(x), for every x ∈ A, that is, appv ◦ Df = Dvf on A.
So, we have
Du(Df)(a)(v) = Du(Dvf)(a),
39.6. SECOND-ORDER AND HIGHER-ORDER DERIVATIVES 1439
and since D2
f(a)(u) = Du(Df)(a), we get
D
2
f(a)(u)(v) = Du(Dvf)(a).
Thus, when D2
f(a) exists, Du(Dvf)(a) exists, and
D
2
f(a)(u)(v) = Du(Dvf)(a),
for all u, v ∈
−→E .
Definition 39.13. We denote Du(Dvf)(a) by D2
u,vf(a) (or DuDvf(a)).
Recall from Proposition 37.60, that the map from L2(
−→E ,
−→E ;
−→F ) to L(
−→E ;L(
−→E ;
−→F )) de-
fined such that g 7→ ϕ iff for every g ∈ L2(
−→E ,
−→E ;
−→F ),
ϕ(u)(v) = g(u, v),
is an isomorphism of vector spaces. Thus, we will consider D2
f(a) ∈ L(
−→E ;L(
−→E ;
−→F ))
as a continuous bilinear map in L2(
−→E ,
−→E ;
−→F ), and we will write D2
f(a)(u, v), instead of
D2
f(a)(u)(v).
Then, the above discussion can be summarized by saying that when D2
f(a) is defined,
we have
D
2
f(a)(u, v) = DuDvf(a).
Definition 39.14. When E has finite dimension and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E, we
denote DejDei
f(a) by ∂
2
f
∂xi∂xj
(a), when i 6 = j, and we denote DeiDei
f(a) by ∂
2
f
∂x2
i
(a).
The following important lemma attributed to Schwarz can be shown, using Proposition
39.12. Given a bilinear map f :
−→E ×
−→E →
−→F , recall that f is symmetric, if
f(u, v) = f(v, u),
for all u, v ∈
−→E .
Proposition 39.20. (Schwarz’s lemma) Given two normed affine spaces E and F, given
any open subset A of E, given any f : A → F, for every a ∈ A, if D2
f(a) exists, then
D2
f(a) ∈ L2(
−→E ,
−→E ;
−→F ) is a continuous symmetric bilinear map. As a corollary, if E is of
finite dimension n, and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E, we have
∂
2
f
∂xi∂xj
(a) = ∂
2
f
∂xj∂xi
(a).
Remark: There is a variation of the above result which does not assume the existence of
D2
f(a), but instead assumes that DuDvf and DvDuf exist on an open subset containing a
and are continuous at a, and concludes that DuDvf(a) = DvDuf(a). This is just a different
result which does not imply Proposition 39.20, and is not a consequence of Proposition 39.20.

f
∂x∂y (a) and ∂

existence of D2
f(a).
When E if of finite dimension n and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E, if D2
f(a) exists,
for every u = u1e1 + · · · + unen and v = v1e1 + · · · + vnen in

where U is the column matrix representing u, and V is the column matrix representing v,
over the frame (a0,(e1, . . . , en)).
Definition 39.15. The above symmetric matrix is called the Hessian of f at a.
Example 39.10. Consider the function f defined on real invertible 2×2 matrices such that
ad − bc > 0 given by
f(a, b, c, d) = log(ad − bc).
We immediately verify that the Jacobian matrix of f is given by
dfa,b,c,d =

39.6. SECOND-ORDER AND HIGHER-ORDER DERIVATIVES 1441
Using the formula for the derivative of the inversion map and the chain rule we can show
that
D
2
f(A)(X1, X2) = −tr(A
−1X1A
−1X2),
and so
Hf(A)(X1, X2) = −tr(A
−1X1A
−1X2),
a formula which is far from obvious.
The function f can be generalized to matrices A ∈ GL+
(n, R), that is, n×n real invertible
matrices of positive determinants, as
f(A) = log det(A).
It can be shown that the formulae
dfA(X) = tr(A
−1X)
D
2
f(A)(X1, X2) = −tr(A
−1X1A
−1X2)
also hold.
Example 39.11. If we restrict the function of Example 39.10 to symmetric positive definite
matrices we obtain the function g defined by
g(a, b, c) = log(ac − b
2
).
We immediately verify that the Jacobian matrix of g is given by
dga,b,c =
ac −

Computing second-order derivatives, we find that the Hessian matrix of g is given by

Although this is not obvious, it can be shown that if ac − b
2 > 0 and a, c > 0, then the
matrix −Hg(a, b, c) is symmetric positive definite.
If F itself is of finite dimension, and (b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) is a frame for F, then f =

Thus, we could describe the vector D2
f(a)(u, v) in terms of an mn×mn-matrix consisting
of m diagonal blocks, which are the above Hessians, and the row matrix (U
> , . . . , U > ) (m
times) and the column matrix consisting of m copies of V .
We now indicate briefly how higher-order derivatives are defined. Let m ≥ 2. Given
a function f : A → F as before, for any a ∈ A, if the derivatives Di
f exist on A for all
i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, by induction, Dm−1
f can be considered to be a continuous function
Dm−1
f : A → Lm−1(
−−−→
E
m−1
;
−→F ).
Definition 39.16. Define Dmf(a), the m-th derivative of f at a, as
D
mf(a) = D(Dm−1
f)(a).
Then Dmf(a) can be identified with a continuous m-multilinear map in Lm(
−→E
m;
−→F ). We
can then show (as we did before), that if Dmf(a) is defined, then
D
mf(a)(u1, . . . , um) = Du1
. . . Dumf(a).
Definition 39.17. When E if of finite dimension n and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E,
if Dmf(a) exists, for every j1, . . . , jm ∈ {1, . . . , n}, we denote Dejm
. . . Dej1
f(a) by
∂
mf
∂xj1
. . . ∂xjm
(a).
Example 39.12. Going back to the function f of Example 39.10 given by f(A) = log det(A),
using the formula for the derivative of the inversion map, the chain rule and the product
rule, we can show that
D
mf(A)(X1, . . . , Xm) = (−1)m−1 X
σ∈Sm−1
tr(A
−1X1A
−1Xσ(1)+1A
−1Xσ(2)+1 · · · A
−1Xσ(m−1)+1)
for any m ≥ 1, where A ∈ GL+
(n, R) and X1, . . . Xm are any n × n real matrices.
Given a m-multilinear map f ∈ Lm(
−→E
m;
−→F ), recall that f is symmetric if
f(uπ(1), . . . , uπ(m)) = f(u1, . . . , um),
for all u1, . . . , um ∈
−→E , and all permutations π on {1, . . . , m}. Then, the following general￾ization of Schwarz’s lemma holds.
Proposition 39.21. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, given any open subset A
of E, given any f : A → F, for every a ∈ A, for every m ≥ 1, if Dmf(a) exists, then
Dmf(a) ∈ Lm(
−→E
m;
−→F ) is a continuous symmetric m-multilinear map. As a corollary, if E
is of finite dimension n, and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E, we have
∂
mf
∂xj1
. . . ∂xjm
(a) = ∂

∂xπ(j1)
. . . ∂xπ(jm)
(a),
for every j1, . . . , jm ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and for every permutation π on {1, . . . , m}.
39.6. SECOND-ORDER AND HIGHER-ORDER DERIVATIVES 1443
Because the trace function is invariant under permutation of its arguments (tr(XY ) =
tr(Y X)), we see that the m-th derivatives in Example 39.12 are indeed symmetric multilinear
maps.
If E is of finite dimension n, and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E, Dmf(a) is a symmetric
m-multilinear map, and we have
D

uj = uj,1e1 + · · · + uj,nen.
The concept of C
1
-function is generalized to the concept of C
m-function, and Theorem
39.13 can also be generalized.
Definition 39.18. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, and an open subset A of E,
for any m ≥ 1, we say that a function f : A → F is of class C
m on A or a C
m-function on
A if Dk
f exists and is continuous on A for every k, 1 ≤ k ≤ m. We say that f : A → F
is of class C
∞ on A or a C
∞-function on A if Dk
f exists and is continuous on A for every
k ≥ 1. A C
∞-function (on A) is also called a smooth function (on A). A C
m-diffeomorphism
f : A → B between A and B (where A is an open subset of E and B is an open subset
of B) is a bijection between A and B = f(A), such that both f : A → B and its inverse
f
−1
: B → A are C
m-functions.
Equivalently, f is a C
m-function on A if f is a C
1
-function on A and Df is a C
m−1
-
function on A.
We have the following theorem giving a necessary and sufficient condition for f to a
C
m-function on A. A generalization to the case where E = (E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (En, an) also
holds.
Theorem 39.22. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, where E is of finite dimension
n, and where (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) is a frame of E, given any open subset A of E, given any
function f : A → F, for any m ≥ 1, the derivative Dmf is a C
m-function on A iff every
partial derivative Dujk

f (or ∂

f
∂xj1
. . . ∂xjk
(a)) is defined and continuous on A, for all
k, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, and all j1, . . . , jk ∈ {1, . . . , n}. As a corollary, if F is of finite dimension p,
and (b0,(v1, . . . , vp)) is a frame of F, the derivative Dmf is defined and continuous on A iff
every partial derivative Dujk
. . . Duj1
fi (or ∂
k
fi
∂xj1
. . . ∂xjk
(a)) is defined and continuous on A,
for all k, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ p, and all j1, . . . , jk ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Definition 39.19. When E = R (or E = C), for any a ∈ E, Dmf(a)(1, . . . , 1) is a vector
in
−→F , called the mth-order vector derivative. As in the case m = 1, we will usually identify
the multilinear map Dmf(a) with the vector Dmf(a)(1, . . . , 1).
1444 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
Some notational conventions can also be introduced to simplify the notation of higher￾order derivatives, and we discuss such conventions very briefly.
Recall that when E is of finite dimension n, and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is a frame for E, Dmf(a)
is a symmetric m-multilinear map, and we have
D
mf(a)(u1, . . . , um) = X

where j ranges over all functions j : {1, . . . , m} → {1, . . . , n}, for any m vectors
uj = uj,1e1 + · · · + uj,nen.
We can then group the various occurrences of ∂xjk

In the next section, we survey various versions of Taylor’s formula.
39.7 Taylor’s formula, Fa`a di Bruno’s formula
We discuss, without proofs, several versions of Taylor’s formula. The hypotheses required in
each version become increasingly stronger. The first version can be viewed as a generalization
of the notion of derivative. Given an m-linear map f :
−→E
m →
−→F , for any vector h ∈
−→E , we
abbreviate
f(h, . . . , h
|
{z
}
m
)
by f(h
m). The version of Taylor’s formula given next is sometimes referred to as the formula
of Taylor–Young.
39.7. TAYLOR’S FORMULA, FAA DI BRUNO’S FORMULA ` 1445
Theorem 39.23. (Taylor–Young) Given two normed affine spaces E and F, for any open
subset A ⊆ E, for any function f : A → F, for any a ∈ A, if Dk
f exists in A for all k,
1 ≤ k ≤ m − 1, and if Dmf(a) exists, then we have:

m (h),
for any h such that a + h ∈ A, and where limh→0, h6=0  (h) = 0.
The above version of Taylor’s formula has applications to the study of relative maxima
(or minima) of real-valued functions. It is also used to study the local properties of curves
and surfaces.
The next version of Taylor’s formula can be viewed as a generalization of Proposition
39.12. It is sometimes called the Taylor formula with Lagrange remainder or generalized
mean value theorem.
Theorem 39.24. (Generalized mean value theorem) Let E and F be two normed affine
spaces, let A be an open subset of E, and let f : A → F be a function on A. Given any
a ∈ A and any h 6 = 0 in
−→E , if the closed segment [a, a + h] is contained in A, Dk
f exists in
A for all k, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, Dm+1f(x) exists at every point x of the open segment ]a, a + h[, and

The above theorem is sometimes stated under the slightly stronger assumption that f is
a C
m-function on A. If f : A → R is a real-valued function, Theorem 39.24 can be refined a
little bit. This version is often called the formula of Taylor–MacLaurin.
Theorem 39.25. (Taylor–MacLaurin) Let E be a normed affine space, let A be an open
subset of E, and let f : A → R be a real-valued function on A. Given any a ∈ A and any
h 6 = 0 in
−→E , if the closed segment [a, a + h] is contained in A, if Dk
f exists in A for all k,
1 ≤ k ≤ m, and Dm+1f(x) exists at every point x of the open segment ]a, a + h[, then there
is some θ ∈ R, with 0 < θ < 1, such that

1446 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
Example 39.13. Going back to the function f of Example 39.10 given by f(A) = log det(A),
we know from Example 39.12 that
D
mf(A)(X1, . . . , Xm) = (−1)m−1 X
σ∈Sm−1
tr(A
−1X1A
−1Xσ(1)+1 · · · A
−1Xσ(m−1)+1) (∗)
for all m ≥ 1, with A ∈ GL+
(n, R). If we make the stronger assumption that A is symmetric
positive definite, then for any other symmetric positive definite matrix B, since the symmetric
positive definite matrices form a convex set, the matrices A + θ(B − A) = (1 − θ)A + θB are
also symmetric positive definite for θ ∈ [0, 1]. Theorem 39.25 applies with H = B − A (a
symmetric matrix), and using (∗), we obtain
log det(A + H) = log det(A) + tr  A

,
for some θ such that 0 < θ < 1. In particular, if A = I, for any symmetric matrix H such
that I + H is symmetric positive definite, we obtain
log det(I + H) = tr  H −

such that 1 + H > 0 and the trace function is the identity, so we recognize the partial sum
of the series for x 7→ log(1 + x),

We also mention for “mathematical culture,” a version with integral remainder, in the
case of a real-valued function. This is usually called Taylor’s formula with integral remainder .
Theorem 39.26. (Taylor’s formula with integral remainder) Let E be a normed affine space,
let A be an open subset of E, and let f : A → R be a real-valued function on A. Given any
a ∈ A and any h 6 = 0 in
−→E , if the closed segment [a, a + h] is contained in A, and if f is a
C
