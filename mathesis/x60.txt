3 → R. As we have just explained, there is a
bijection
p(f) 7→ P(Ker f)
between P(E
∗
) and the set of lines in P(E), mapping every point a
∗ = p(f) to the line
Da
∗ = P(Ker f).
Is there a way to give a geometric interpretation in P(E) of a line ∆ in P(E
∗
)? Well, a
line ∆ in P(E
∗
) is defined by two distinct points a
∗ = p(f) and b
∗ = p(g), where f, g ∈ E
∗
are two linearly independent linear forms. But f and g define two distinct planes H1 = Ker f
and H2 = Ker g through the origin (in E = R
3
), and H1 and H2 define two distinct lines
D1 = p(H1) and D2 = p(H2) in P(E). The line ∆ in P(E
∗
) is of the form ∆ = p(V ), where
V = {λf + µg | λ, µ ∈ R}
is the plane in E
∗
spanned by f, g. Every nonnull linear form λf + µg ∈ V defines a plane
H = Ker (λf + µg) in E, and since H1 and H2 (in E) are distinct, they intersect in a line
L that is also contained in every plane H as above. Thus, the set of planes in E associated
with nonnull linear forms in V is just the set of all planes containing the line L. Passing to
P(E) using the projection p, the line L in E corresponds to the point c = p(L) in P(E),
which is just the intersection of the lines D1 and D2. Thus, every point of the line ∆ in
P(E
∗
) corresponds to a line in P(E) passing through c (the intersection of the lines D1 and
D2), and this correspondence is bijective.
In summary, a line ∆ in P(E
∗
) corresponds to the set of all lines in P(E) through some
given point. Such sets of lines are called pencils of lines and are illustrated in Figure 26.6.
The above discussion can be generalized to higher dimensions and is discussed quite
extensively in Section 26.12. In brief, letting E = R
n+1, there is a bijection mapping points
in P(E
∗
) to hyperplanes in P(E). A line in P(E
∗
) corresponds to a pencil of hyperplanes in

(in RP3
) containing some given line W. Other examples of unusual projective spaces and
pencils will be given in Section 26.4.
Next, we define the projective analogues of bases (or frames) and linear maps.
26.4 Projective Frames
As all good notions in projective geometry, the concept of a projective frame turns out to
be uniquely defined up to a scalar.
Definition 26.3. Given a nontrivial vector space E of dimension n+ 1, a family (ai)1≤i≤n+2
of n + 2 points of the projective space P(E) is a projective frame (or basis) of P(E) if
there exists some basis (e1, . . . , en+1) of E such that ai = p(ei) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, and
an+2 = p(e1 + · · · + en+1). Any basis with the above property is said to be associated with
the projective frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2.
The justification of Definition 26.3 is given by the following proposition.
Proposition 26.2. If (ai)1≤i≤n+2 is a projective frame of P(E), for any two bases (u1, . . .,
un+1), (v1, . . . , vn+1) of E such that ai = p(ui) = p(vi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, and an+2 =
p(u1 + · · · + un+1) = p(v1 + · · · + vn+1), there is a nonzero scalar λ ∈ K such that vi = λui,
for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1.
Proof. Since p(ui) = p(vi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, there exist some nonzero scalars λi ∈ K such
that vi = λiui
for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1. Since we must have
p(u1 + · · · + un+1) = p(v1 + · · · + vn+1),
D1

there is some λ 6 = 0 such that
λ(u1 + · · · + un+1) = v1 + · · · + vn+1 = λ1u1 + · · · + λn+1un+1,
and thus we have
(λ − λ1)u1 + · · · + (λ − λn+1)un+1 = 0,
and since (u1, . . . , un+1) is a basis, we have λi = λ for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, which implies
λ1 = · · · = λn+1 = λ.
Proposition 26.2 shows that a projective frame determines a unique basis of E, up to a
(nonzero) scalar. This would not necessarily be the case if we did not have a point an+2 such
that an+2 = p(u1 + · · · + un+1).
When n = 0, the projective space consists of a single point a, and there is only one
projective frame, the pair (a, a). When n = 1, the projective space is a line, and a projective
frame consists of any three pairwise distinct points a, b, c on this line. When n = 2, the
projective space is a plane, and a projective frame consists of any four distinct points a, b, c, d
such that a, b, c are the vertices of a nondegenerate triangle and d is not on any of the lines
determined by the sides of this triangle. These examples of projective frames are illustrated
in Figure 26.7. The reader can easily generalize to higher dimensions.
Given a projective frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2 of P(E), let (u1, . . . , un+1) be a basis of E associated
with (ai)1≤i≤n+2. For every a ∈ P(E), there is some u ∈ E − {0} such that
a = [u]∼ = {λu | λ ∈ K − {0}},
the equivalence class of u, and the set
{(x1, . . . , xn+1) ∈ Kn+1 | v = x1u1 + · · · + xn+1un+1, v ∈ [u]∼ = a}
of coordinates of all the vectors in the equivalence class [u]∼ is called the set of homogeneous
coordinates of a over the basis (u1, . . . , un+1).
Note that for each homogeneous coordinate (x1, . . . , xn+1) we must have xi 6 = 0 for some
i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, and any two homogeneous coordinates (x1, . . . , xn+1) and (y1, . . . , yn+1)
for a differ by a nonzero scalar, i.e., there is some λ 6 = 0 such that yi = λxi
, 1 ≤ i ≤
n + 1. Homogeneous coordinates (x1, . . . , xn+1) are sometimes denoted by (x1 : · · · : xn+1),
for instance in algebraic geometry.
By Proposition 26.2, any other basis (v1, . . . , vn+1) associated with the projective frame
(ai)1≤i≤n+2 differs from (u1, . . . , un+1) by a nonzero scalar, which implies that the set of ho￾mogeneous coordinates of a ∈ P(E) over the basis (v1, . . . , vn+1) is identical to the set of
homogeneous coordinates of a ∈ P(E) over the basis (u1, . . . , un+1). Consequently, we can
associate a unique set of homogeneous coordinates to every point a ∈ P(E) with respect to
the projective frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2. With respect to this projective frame, note that an+2 has ho￾mogeneous coordinates (1, . . . , 1), and that ai has homogeneous coordinates (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0),
where the 1 is in the ith position, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1. We summarize the above discussion
in the following definition.

Definition 26.4. Given a nontrivial vector space E of dimension n + 1, for any projective
frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2 of P(E) and for any point a ∈ P(E), the set of homogeneous coordinates
of a with respect to (ai)1≤i≤n+2 is the set of (n + 1)-tuples
{(λx1, . . . , λxn+1) ∈ Kn+1 | xi 6 = 0 for some i, λ 6 = 0, a = p(x1u1 + · · · + xn+1un+1)},
where (u1, . . . , un+1) is any basis of E associated with (ai)1≤i≤n+2.
Given a projective frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2 for P(E), if (x1, . . . , xn+1) are homogeneous coordi￾nates of a point a ∈ P(E), we write a = (x1, . . . , xn+1), and with a slight abuse of language,
we may even talk about a point (x1, . . . , xn+1) in P(E) and write (x1, . . . , xn+1) ∈ P(E).
The special case of the projective line P
1
K is worth examining. The projective line P
1
K
consists of all equivalence classes [x, y] of pairs (x, y) ∈ K2
such that (x, y) 6 = (0, 0), under
the equivalence relation ∼ defined such that
(x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2) iff x2 = λx1 and y2 = λy1,
for some λ ∈ K −{0}. When y 6 = 0, the equivalence class of (x, y) contains the representative
(xy−1
, 1), and when y = 0, the equivalence class of (x, 0) contains the representative (1, 0).
26.4. PROJECTIVE FRAMES 871
Thus, there is a bijection between K and the set of equivalence classes containing some
representative of the form (x, 1), and we denote the class [x, 1] by x. The equivalence class
[1, 0] is denoted by ∞ and it is called the point at infinity. Thus, the projective line P
1
K is
in bijection with K ∪ {∞}. The three points ∞ = [1, 0], 0 = [0, 1], and 1 = [1, 1], form a
projective frame for P
1
K. The projective frame (∞, 0, 1) is often called the canonical frame
of P
1
K.
Homogeneous coordinates are also very useful to handle hyperplanes in terms of equa￾tions. If (ai)1≤i≤n+2 is a projective frame for P(E) associated with a basis (u1, . . . , un+1)
for E, a nonnull linear form f is determined by n + 1 scalars α1, . . . , αn+1 (not all null),
and a point x ∈ P(E) of homogeneous coordinates (x1, . . . , xn+1) belongs to the projective
hyperplane P(H) of equation f iff
α1x1 + · · · + αn+1xn+1 = 0.
In particular, if P(E) is a projective plane, a line is defined by an equation of the form
αx + βy + γz = 0. If P(E) is a projective space, a plane is defined by an equation of the
form αx + βy + γz + δw = 0.
As an application, let us find the coordinates of the intersection point of two distinct
lines in a projective plane P(E) (with respect to some projective frame (a1, a2, a3, a4)). If D
and D0 are two lines of equations
αx + βy + γz = 0 and α
0 x + β
0 y + γ
0 z = 0, (∗)
then D and D0 are distinct lines iff the matrix

has rank 2. We claim that the intersection Q of the lines D and D0 has homogeneous
coordinates
(βγ0 − β

in other words, it is the projective point corresponding to the cross-product

as illustrated in Figure 26.8.

which confirms that the point
Q = (βγ0 − β

satisfies both equations in (∗), and thus belongs to both lines D and D0 . Since the matrix

has rank 2, at least one of the coordinates of Q is nonzero, so Q is indeed a point in the
projective plane, and it is the intersection of the lines D and D0 .
The result that we just proved yields the following criterion for three lines D, D0 , D00 in a
projective plane to pass through a common point (to be concurrent). In a projective plane,

We can also find the equation of the unique line D = h P, P0 i passing through two distinct
points P = (u: v : w) and P
0 = (u
0 : v
0 : w
0 ) of a projective plane. This line is given by the
equation
(vw0 − v

and since

has rank 2 because P 6 = P

Observe that the coefficients of the equation (††) correspond to the cross-product

The equation of the line D = h P, P0 i must be satisfied by the homogeneous coordinates
of the points P and P

and a reasoning as in the case of the intersection of lines shows that the equation of the line
passing through P and P
0 is given by equation (††).
Then, in a projective plane, three points P = (u: v : w), P

We also have the following proposition giving another characterization of projective
frames.
Proposition 26.3. A family (ai)1≤i≤n+2 of n+ 2 points is a projective frame of P(E) iff for
every i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2, the subfamily (aj )j6=i is projectively independent.
Proof. We leave as an (easy) exercise the fact that if (ai)1≤i≤n+2 is a projective frame, then
each subfamily (aj )j6=i
is projectively independent. Conversely, pick some ui ∈ E − {0} such
that ai = p(ui), 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2. Since (aj )j6=n+2 is projectively independent, (u1, . . . , un+1) is
a basis of E. Thus, we must have
un+2 = λ1u1 + · · · + λn+1un+1,
for some λi ∈ K. However, since for every i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, the family (aj )j6=i
is projectively
independent, we must have λi 6 = 0, and thus (λ1u1, . . . , λn+1un+1) is also a basis of E, and
since
un+2 = λ1u1 + · · · + λn+1un+1,
it induces the projective frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2.
Figure 26.9 shows a projective frame (a, b, c, d) in a projective plane. With respect to
this projective frame, the points a, b, c, d have homogeneous coordinates (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0),
(0, 0, 1), and (1, 1, 1). Let a
0 be the intersection of h d, ai and h b, ci , b
0 be the intersection of
homogeneous coordinates (0
h
d, bi and h a, ci , and c
0 be the intersection of

Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen [92] (Chapter III, §15, page 96).
Recall that the equation of a line (a hyperplane in a projective plane) in terms of homoge￾neous coordinates with respect to the projective frame (a, b, c, d) is given by a homogeneous
equation of the form
αx + βy + γz = 0,
where α, β, γ are not all zero. It is easily verified that the equations of the lines h a, bi , h a, ci ,
h
b, ci , are z = 0, y = 0, and x = 0, and the equations of the lines h a, di , h b, di , and h c, di ,

If we let e be the intersection of h b, ci and h b
0 , c0 i , f be the intersection of h a, ci and h a
0 , c0 i ,
and g be the intersection of h a, bi and h a
0 , b0 i , then it easily seen that e, f, g have homogeneous
coordinates (0, −1, 1), (1, 0, −1), and (−1, 1, 0). For example, since the equation of the line
h
b, ci is x = 0 and the equation of the line h b
0 , c0 i is x = y + z, for x = 0, we get z = −y,
which correspond to the homogeneous coordinates (0, −1, 1) for e.
The coordinates of the points e, f, g satisfy the equation x + y + z = 0, which shows that
they are collinear.
As pointed out in Coxeter [45] (Proposition 2.41), this is a special case of the projec￾tive version of Desargues’s theorem (Proposition 26.7) applied to the triangles (a, b, c) and
(a
0 , b0 , c0 ). Indeed, by construction, the lines h a, a0 i , h b, b0 i , and h c, c0 i intersect in the common
point d. The line containing the points e, f, g is called the polar line (or fundamental line)
of d with respect to the triangle (a, b, c) (see Pedoe [136]). The diagram also shows the
intersection g of h a, bi and h a
0 , b0 i .

Let E be the vector space (over R) consisting of all homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in
x, y, z of the form
ax2 + ay2 + bxz + cyz + dz2
(plus the null polynomial). The projective space P(E) consists of all equivalence classes
[P]∼ = {λP | λ 6 = 0},
where P(x, y, z) is a nonnull homogeneous polynomial in E. We want to give a geometric
interpretation of the points of the projective space P(E). In order to do so, pick some
projective frame (a1, a2, a3, a4) for the projective plane RP2
, and associate to every [P] ∈
P(E) the subset of RP2
known as its its zero locus (or zero set, or variety) V ([P]), and
defined such that
V ([P]) = {a ∈ RP2
| P(x, y, z) = 0},
where (x, y, z) are homogeneous coordinates for a.
As explained earlier, we also use the simpler notation
V ([P]) = {(x, y, z) ∈ RP2
| P(x, y, z) = 0}.
Actually, in order for V ([P]) to make sense, we have to check that V ([P]) does not depend
on the representative chosen in the equivalence class [P] = {λP | λ 6 = 0}. This is because
P(x, y, z) = 0 iff λP(x, y, z) = 0 when λ 6 = 0.
For simplicity of notation, we also denote V ([P]) by V (P). We also have to check that if
(λx, λy, λz) are other homogeneous coordinates for a ∈ RP2
, where λ 6 = 0, then
P(x, y, z) = 0 iff P(λx, λy, λz) = 0.
However, since P(x, y, z) is homogeneous of degree 2, we have
P(λx, λy, λz) = λ
2P(x, y, z),
and since λ 6 = 0,
P(x, y, z) = 0 iff λ
2P(x, y, z) = 0.
The above argument applies to any homogeneous polynomial P(x1, . . . , xn) in n variables of
any degree m, since
P(λx1, . . . , λxn) = λ
mP(x1, . . . , xn).
Thus, we can associate to every [P] ∈ P(E) the curve V (P) in RP2
. One might won￾der why we are considering only homogeneous polynomials of degree 2, and not arbitrary
polynomials of degree 2? The first reason is that the polynomials in x, y, z of degree 2 do
not form a vector space. For example, if P = x
2 + x and Q = −x
2 + y, the polynomial
P + Q = x + y is not of degree 2. We could consider the set of polynomials of degree ≤ 2,
26.4. PROJECTIVE FRAMES 877
which is a vector space, but now the problem is that V (P) is not necessarily well defined!.
For example, if P(x, y, z) = −x
2 + 1, we have
P(1, 0, 0) = 0 and P(2, 0, 0) = −3,
and yet (2, 0, 0) = 2(1, 0, 0), so that P(x, y, z) takes different values depending on the rep￾resentative chosen in the equivalence class [1, 0, 0]. Thus, we are led to restrict ourselves to
homogeneous polynomials. Actually, this is usually an advantage more than a disadvantage,
because homogeneous polynomials tend to be well behaved.
What are the curves V (P)? One way to “see” such curves is to go back to the hyperplane
model of RP2
in terms of the plane H of equation z = 1 in R
3
. Then the trace of V (P) on
H is the circle of equation
ax2 + ay2 + bx + cy + d = 0.
Thus, we may think of P(E) as a projective space of circles. However, there are some
problems. For example, V (P) may be empty! This happens, for instance, for P(x, y, z) =
x
2 + y
2 + z
2
, since the equation
x
2 + y
2 + z
2 = 0
has only the trivial solution (0, 0, 0), which does not correspond to any point in RP2
. Indeed,
only nonnull vectors in R
3 yield points in RP2
. It is also possible that V (P) is reduced to a
single point, for instance when P(x, y, z) = x
2 + y
2
, since the only homogeneous solution of
x
2 + y
2 = 0
is (0, 0, 1). Also, note that the map
[P] 7→ V (P)
is not injective. For instance, P = x
2 + y
2 and Q = x
2 + 2y
2 define the same degenerate
circle reduced to the point (0, 0, 1). We also accept as circles the union of two lines, as in
the case
(bx + cy + dz)z = 0,
where a = 0, and even a double line, as in the case
z
2 = 0,
where a = b = c = 0.
A clean way to resolve most of these problems is to switch to homogeneous polynomials
over the complex field C and to consider curves in CP2
. This is what is done in algebraic
geometry (see Fulton [66] or Harris [87]). If P(x, y, z) is a homogeneous polynomial over C of
degree 2 (plus the null polynomial), it is easy to show that V (P) is always nonempty, and in
fact infinite. It can also be shown that V (P) = V (Q) implies that Q = λP for some λ ∈ C,
with λ 6 = 0 (see Samuel [142], Section 1.6, Theorem 10). Another advantage of switching to
878 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
the complex field C is that the theory of intersection is cleaner. Thus, any two circles that do
not contain a common line always intersect in four points, some of which might be multiple
points (as in the case of tangent circles). This may seem surprising, since in the real plane,
two circles intersect in at most two points. Where are the other two points? They turn out
to be the points (1, i, 0) and (1, −i, 0), as one can immediately verify. We can think of them
as complex points at infinity! Not only are they at infinity, but they are not real. No wonder
we cannot see them! We will come back to these points, called the circular points, in Section
26.14.
Going back to the vector space E of circles over R, it is worth saying that it can be shown
that if V (P) = V (Q) contains at least two points (in which case, V (P) is actually infinite),
then Q = λP for some λ ∈ R with λ 6 = 0 (see Tisseron [175], Theorem 3.6.1 and Theorem
4.7). Thus, even over R, the mapping
[P] 7→ V (P)
is injective whenever V (P) is neither empty nor reduced to a single point. Note that the
projective space P(E) of circles has dimension 3. In fact, it is easy to show that three distinct
points that are not collinear determine a unique circle (see Samuel [142], Section 1.6).
In a similar vein, we can define the projective space of conics P(E) where E is the vector
space (over R) consisting of all homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in x, y, z,
ax2 + by2 + cxy + dxz + eyz + fz2
(plus the null polynomial). The curves V (P) are indeed conics, perhaps degenerate. To see
this, we can use the hyperplane model of RP2
. The trace of V (P) on the plane of equation
z = 1 is the conic of equation
ax2 + by2 + cxy + dx + ey + f = 0.
Another way to see that V (P) is a conic is to observe that in R
3
,
ax2 + by2 + cxy + dxz + eyz + fz2 = 0
defines a cone with vertex (0, 0, 0), and since its section by the plane z = 1 is a conic, all of
its sections by planes are conics. See Figure 26.10 for schematic illustration of a projective
conic embedded in RP2
.
The mapping
[P] 7→ V (P)
is still injective when E is defined over the ground field C (Samuel [142], Section 1.6, Theorem
10), or if V (P) has at least two points when E is defined over R (Tisseron [175], Theorem
3.6.1 and Theorem 4.7). Note that the projective space P(E) of conics has dimension 5. In
fact, it can be shown that five distinct points, no four of which are collinear, determine a

unique conic (among many sources, see Samuel [142], Section 1.7, Theorem 17, or Coxeter
[45], Theorem 6.56, where a geometric construction is given in Section 6.6).
In fact, if we pick a projective frame (a1, a2, a3, a4) in CP2
(or RP2
), and if the five points
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 have homogeneous coordinates pi = (xi
, yi
, zi) for i = 1, . . . , 5 and (x, y, z)
are variables, then it is an easy exercise to show that the equation of the unique conic C
passing through the points p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 is given by

The polynomial obtained by expanding the above determinant according to the first row is a
homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in the variables x, y, z, and it is not the zero polynomial
880 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
because the 5 × 6 matrix obtained by deleting the first row in the matrix of the determinant
has rank 5. Indeed, this is the matrix of the linear system determining the six coefficients
of the conic passign through p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 (up to a scalar), and since this conic is unique,
this matrix must have rank 5.
It is also interesting to see what are lines in the space of circles or in the space of conics.
In both cases we get pencils (of circles and conics, respectively). For more details, see Samuel
[142], Sidler [161], Tisseron [175], Lehmann and Bkouche [115], Pedoe [136], Coxeter [45, 46],
and Veblen and Young [183, 184].
The generalization of the space of projective conics is the space of projective quadrics
P(E), where E is the vector space (over a field K, typically K = R or K = C) consisting of
all homogeneous polynomials P(x1, . . . , xN+1) of degree 2 in the variables x1, . . . , xN+1, with
N ≥ 3 (plus the null polynomial). The zero locus V (P) of P is defined just as before as
V (P) = {(x1 : · · · : xN+1) ∈ P
N
K | P(x1, . . . , xN+1) = 0}.
If the field K is algebraically closed, in particular if K = C, then V (P) = V (Q) implies
that there is some nonzero λ ∈ K such that Q = λP; see Berger [12] (Chapter 14, Theorem
14.1.6.2).
Another situation where the map [P] 7→ V (P) is injective involves the notion of simple
(or regular) point of a quadric. For any a = (a1 : · · · : aN+1) ∈ P
N
K, let Pxi
(a) be the partial
derivative of P at a given by
Pxi
(a) = ∂P
∂xi
(a1, . . . , aN+1).
Strictly speaking, Pxi
(a) depends on the representative (a1, . . . , aN+1) ∈ KN+1 chosen for
the point a, but since P is homogeneous of degree 2, for any nonzero λ ∈ K,
∂P
∂xi
(λa1, . . . , λaN+1) = λ
∂P
∂xi
(a1, . . . , aN+1).
Thus Pxi
(a) is defined up to a nonzero scalar. In particular, whether or not Pxi
(a) = 0
depends only the point a = (a1 : · · · : aN+1) ∈ P
N
K. Then the point a ∈ V (P) is said to be
simple (or regular ) if
Pxi
(a) 6 = 0 for some i, 1 ≤ i ≤ N + 1.
Otherwise, if Px1
(a) = · · · = PxN+1 (a) = 0, we say that a ∈ V (P) is a singular point.
If a ∈ V (P) is a regular point, then the tangent hyperplane TaV (P) to V (P) at a is the
hyperplane given by the equation
Px1
(a)x1 + · · · + PxN+1 (a)xN+1 = 0.
It can be shown that if the field K is not the field F2 = {0, 1} and if the quadric V (P)
contains some regular point, then V (P) = V (Q) implies that there is some nonzero λ ∈ K
such that Q = λP; see Samuel [142] (Chapter 3, Theorem 46).
26.4. PROJECTIVE FRAMES 881
Quadrics, projective, affine, and Euclidean, have been thoroughly investigated. Among
many sources, the reader is referred to Berger [11], Samuel [142], Tisseron [175], Fresnel [65],
and Vienne [185].
We could also investigate algebraic plane curves of any degree m, by letting E be the
vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m in x, y, z (plus the null polynomial).
The zero locus V (P) of P is defined just as before as
V (P) = {(x: y : z) ∈ RP2
| P(x, y, z) = 0}.
Observe that when m = 1, since homogeneous polynomials of degree 1 are linear forms, we
are back to the case where E = (R
