with its sum denoted u âˆˆ V .

A.2 The Hilbert Space ` 2
(K) and the Rieszâ€“Fischer
Theorem
Proposition A.2 suggests looking at the space of sequences (zk)kâˆˆK (where zk âˆˆ C) such that
(|zk|
2
)kâˆˆK is summable. Indeed, such spaces are Hilbert spaces, and it turns out that every
Hilbert space is isomorphic to one of those. Such spaces are the infinite-dimensional version
of the spaces C
n under the usual Euclidean norm.
Definition A.3. Given any nonempty index set K, the space ` 2
(K) is the set of all sequences
(zk)kâˆˆK, where zk âˆˆ C, such that (|zk|
2
)kâˆˆK is summable, i.e., P kâˆˆK |zk|
2 < âˆž.
Remarks:
(1) When K is a finite set of cardinality n, `
2
(K) is isomorphic to C
n
.
(2) When K = N, the space ` 2
(N) corresponds to the space ` 2 of Example 2 in Section 14.1
. In that example, we claimed that ` 2 was a Hermitian space, and in fact, a Hilbert
space. We now prove this fact for any index set K.
Proposition A.3. Given any nonempty index set K, the space ` 2
(K) is a Hilbert space
under the Hermitian product
h
(xk)kâˆˆK,(yk)kâˆˆKi =
X
kâˆˆK
xkyk.
The subspace consisting of sequences (zk)kâˆˆK such that zk = 0, except perhaps for finitely
many k, is a dense subspace of ` 2
(K).
A.2. THE HILBERT SPACE ` 2
(K) AND THE RIESZâ€“FISCHER THEOREM 2121
Proof. First we need to prove that ` 2
(K) is a vector space. Assume that (xk)kâˆˆK and (yk)kâˆˆK
are in ` 2
(K). This means that (|xk|
2
)kâˆˆK and (|yk|
2
)kâˆˆK are summable, which, in view of
Proposition A.1(2), is equivalent to the existence of some positive bounds A and B such
that P iâˆˆI
|xi
|
2 < A and P iâˆˆI
|yi
|
2 < B, for every finite subset I of K. To prove that
(|xk + yk|
2
)kâˆˆK is summable, it is sufficient to prove that there is some C > 0 such that
P
iâˆˆI
|xi + yi
|
2 < C for every finite subset I of K. However, the parallelogram inequality
implies that
X
iâˆˆI
|xi + yi
|
2 â‰¤
X
iâˆˆI
2(|xi
|
2 + |yi
|
2
) â‰¤ 2(A + B),
for every finite subset I of K, and we conclude by Proposition A.1(2). Similarly, for every
Î» âˆˆ C, X
iâˆˆI
|Î»xi
|
2 â‰¤
X
iâˆˆI
|Î»|
2
|xi
|
2 â‰¤ |Î»|

and (Î»kxk)kâˆˆK is summable. Therefore, ` 2
(K) is a vector space.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,

for every finite subset I of K. For the third inequality we used the fact that
4CD â‰¤ (C + D)

(with C =
P iâˆˆI
|xi

2 and D =
P iâˆˆI
|yi
|
2
) which is equivalent to
(C âˆ’ D)
2 â‰¥ 0.
By Proposition A.1(2), (|xkyk|)kâˆˆK is summable. The customary language is that (xkyk)kâˆˆK
is absolutely summable. However, it is a standard fact that this implies that (xkyk)kâˆˆK is
summable (For every  > 0, there is some finite subset I of K such that
X
jâˆˆJ

|

|xjyj

proving that (xkyk)kâˆˆK is a Cauchy family, and thus summable). We still have to prove that
`
2
(K) is complete.

)kâˆˆK)nâ‰¥1
of sequences (Î»

Cauchy sequence. This means that for every  > 0, there is some N â‰¥ 1 such that

2122 APPENDIX A. TOTAL ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES IN HILBERT SPACES
for all m, n â‰¥ N. For every fixed k âˆˆ K, this implies that
|Î»

k âˆ’ Î»
n
k
| < 
for all m, n â‰¥ N, which shows that (Î»
n
k
)nâ‰¥1 is a Cauchy sequence in C. Since C is complete,
the sequence (Î»
n
k
)nâ‰¥1 has a limit Î»k âˆˆ C. We claim that (Î»k)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2
(K) and that this is
the limit of ((Î»

k
)kâˆˆK)nâ‰¥1
.
Given any  > 0, the fact that ((Î»

is a Cauchy sequence implies that there is
some N â‰¥ 1 such that for every finite subset I of K, we have

we get

|Î»

2 < ,
for all m â‰¥ N. This proves that (Î»
m

(K) is a
vector space and (Î»

2
(K) for all m â‰¥ 1, we get (Î»k)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2

X
kâˆˆK
|Î»

for all m â‰¥ N, means that the sequence (Î»
m
k
)kâˆˆK converges to (Î»k)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2
(K). The fact
that the subspace consisting of sequences (zk)kâˆˆK such that zk = 0 except perhaps for finitely
many k is a dense subspace of ` 2
(K) is left as an easy exercise.
A.2. THE HILBERT SPACE ` 2
(K) AND THE RIESZâ€“FISCHER THEOREM 2123
Remark: The subspace consisting of all sequences (zk)kâˆˆK such that zk = 0, except perhaps
for finitely many k, provides an example of a subspace which is not closed in ` 2
(K). Indeed,
this space is strictly contained in ` 2
(K), since there are countable sequences of nonnull
elements in ` 2
(K) (why?).
We just need two more propositions before being able to prove that every Hilbert space
is isomorphic to some ` 2
(K).
Proposition A.4. Let E be a Hilbert space, and (uk)kâˆˆK an orthogonal family in E. The
following properties hold:
(1) For every family (Î»k)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2
(K), the family (Î»kuk)kâˆˆK is summable. Furthermore,
v =
P kâˆˆK Î»kuk is the only vector such that ck = Î»k for all k âˆˆ K, where the ck are the
Fourier coefficients of v.
(2) For any two families (Î»k)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2
(K) and (Âµk)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2
(K), if v =
P kâˆˆK Î»kuk and
w =
P kâˆˆK Âµkuk, we have the following equation, also called Parseval identity :
h
v, wi =
X
kâˆˆK
Î»kÂµk.
Proof. (1) The fact that (Î»k)kâˆˆK âˆˆ `
2
(K) means that (|Î»k|
2
)kâˆˆK is summable. The proof
given in Proposition A.2 (3) applies to the family (|Î»k|
2
)kâˆˆK (instead of (|ck|
2
)kâˆˆK), and yields
the fact that (Î»kuk)kâˆˆK is summable. Letting v =
P kâˆˆK Î»kuk, recall that ck = h v, uki /k ukk
2
.
Pick some k âˆˆ K. Since hâˆ’, âˆ’i is continuous, for every  > 0, there is some Î· > 0 such that
| hv, uki âˆ’ hw, uki | < k ukk

whenever
k
v âˆ’ wk < Î·.
However, since for every Î· > 0, there is some finite subset I of K such that

since the ui are orthogonal to v âˆ’

The next proposition states properties characterizing Hilbert bases (total orthogonal
families).
Proposition A.5. Let E be a Hilbert space, and let (uk)kâˆˆK be an orthogonal family in E.
The following properties are equivalent:
A.2. THE HILBERT SPACE ` 2
(K) AND THE RIESZâ€“FISCHER THEOREM 2125
(1) The family (uk)kâˆˆK is a total orthogonal family.
(2) For every vector v âˆˆ E, if (ck)kâˆˆK are the Fourier coefficients of v, then the family
(ckuk)kâˆˆK is summable and v =
P kâˆˆK ckuk.
(3) For every vector v âˆˆ E, we have the Parseval identity :
k
vk
2 =
X
kâˆˆK
|ck|
2
.
(4) For every vector u âˆˆ E, if h u, uki = 0 for all k âˆˆ K, then u = 0.

Figure A.2: A schematic illustration of Proposition A.5. Since (uk)kâˆˆK is a Hilbert basis,
V = E. Then given a vector of E, if we form the Fourier coefficients ck, then form the
Fourier series P kâˆˆK ckuk, we are ensured that v is equal to its Fourier series.
Proof. The equivalence of (1), (2), and (3) is an immediate consequence of Proposition A.2
and Proposition A.4.
(4) If (uk)kâˆˆK is a total orthogonal family and h u, uki = 0 for all k âˆˆ K, since u = P
kâˆˆK ckuk where ck = h u, uki /k ukk
2
, we have ck = 0 for all k âˆˆ K, and u = 0.
Conversely, assume that the closure V of (uk)kâˆˆK is different from E. Then by Proposition
48.7, we have E = V âŠ• V
âŠ¥, where V
âŠ¥ is the orthogonal complement of V , and V
âŠ¥ is
nontrivial since V 6 = E. As a consequence, there is some nonnull vector u âˆˆ V
âŠ¥. But then
u is orthogonal to every vector in V , and in particular,
h
u, uki = 0
for all k âˆˆ K, which, by assumption, implies that u = 0, contradicting the fact that u 6 =
0.
2126 APPENDIX A. TOTAL ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES IN HILBERT SPACES
Remarks:
(1) If E is a Hilbert space and (uk)kâˆˆK is a total orthogonal family in E, there is a simpler
argument to prove that u = 0 if h u, uki = 0 for all k âˆˆ K based on the continuity
of hâˆ’, âˆ’i. The argument is to prove that the assumption implies that h v, ui = 0 for
all v âˆˆ E. Since hâˆ’, âˆ’i is positive definite, this implies that u = 0. By continuity of
hâˆ’, âˆ’i, for every  > 0, there is some Î· > 0 such that for every finite subset I of K,
for every family (Î»i)iâˆˆI , for every v âˆˆ E,

and since by assumption, 
 P iâˆˆI

, u = 0, we get
|hv, ui| < .
Since this holds for every  > 0, we must have h v, ui = 0
(2) If V is any nonempty subset of E, the kind of argument used in the previous remark
can be used to prove that V
âŠ¥ is closed (even if V is not), and that V
âŠ¥âŠ¥ is the closure
of V .
We will now prove that every Hilbert space has some Hilbert basis. This requires using
a fundamental theorem from set theory known as Zornâ€™s lemma, which we quickly review.
Given any set X with a partial ordering â‰¤, recall that a nonempty subset C of X is a
chain if it is totally ordered (i.e., for all x, y âˆˆ C, either x â‰¤ y or y â‰¤ x). A nonempty subset
Y of X is bounded iff there is some b âˆˆ X such that y â‰¤ b for all y âˆˆ Y . Some m âˆˆ X is
maximal iff for every x âˆˆ X, m â‰¤ x implies that x = m. We can now state Zornâ€™s lemma.
For more details, see Rudin [140], Lang [109], or Artin [7].
Proposition A.6. (Zornâ€™s lemma) Given any nonempty partially ordered set X, if every
(nonempty) chain in X is bounded, then X has some maximal element.
A.2. THE HILBERT SPACE ` 2
(K) AND THE RIESZâ€“FISCHER THEOREM 2127
We can now prove the existence of Hilbert bases. We define a partial order on families
(uk)kâˆˆK as follows: for any two families (uk)kâˆˆK1 and (vk)kâˆˆK2
, we say that
(uk)kâˆˆK1 â‰¤ (vk)kâˆˆK2
iff K1 âŠ† K2 and uk = vk for all k âˆˆ K1. This is clearly a partial order.
Proposition A.7. Let E be a Hilbert space. Given any orthogonal family (uk)kâˆˆK in E,
there is a total orthogonal family (ul)lâˆˆL containing (uk)kâˆˆK.
Proof. Consider the set S of all orthogonal families greater than or equal to the family
B = (uk)kâˆˆK. We claim that every chain in S is bounded. Indeed, if C = (Cl)lâˆˆL is a chain
in S, where Cl = (uk,l)kâˆˆKl
, the union family
(uk)kâˆˆ
S lâˆˆL Kl
, where uk = uk,l whenever k âˆˆ Kl
,
is clearly an upper bound for C, and it is immediately verified that it is an orthogonal family.
By Zornâ€™s Lemma A.6, there is a maximal family (ul)lâˆˆL containing (uk)kâˆˆK. If (ul)lâˆˆL is
not dense in E, then its closure V is strictly contained in E, and by Proposition 48.7, the
orthogonal complement V
âŠ¥ of V is nontrivial since V 6 = E. As a consequence, there is some
nonnull vector u âˆˆ V
âŠ¥. But then u is orthogonal to every vector in (ul)lâˆˆL, and we can form
an orthogonal family strictly greater than (ul)lâˆˆL by adding u to this family, contradicting
the maximality of (ul)lâˆˆL. Therefore, (ul)lâˆˆL is dense in E, and thus it is a Hilbert basis.
Remark: It is possible to prove that all Hilbert bases for a Hilbert space E have index sets
K of the same cardinality. For a proof, see Bourbaki [27].
Definition A.4. A Hilbert space E is separable if its Hilbert bases are countable.
At last, we can prove that every Hilbert space is isomorphic to some Hilbert space ` 2
