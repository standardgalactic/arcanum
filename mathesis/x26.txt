.
Since B and −B commute, we have
Q

B = e
−B+B = e
0 = I.
Similarly,
QQ> = e
B
e
−B = e
B−B = e
0 = I,
which concludes the proof.
It can also be shown that det(Q) = det(e
B) = 1, but this requires a better understanding
of the eigenvalues of e
B (see Section 15.5). Furthermore, for every n × n rotation matrix Q
(an orthogonal matrix Q such that det(Q) = 1), there is a skew symmetric matrix B such
that Q = e
B. This is a fundamental property which has applications in robotics for n = 3.
All familiar series have matrix analogs. For example, if k Ak < 1 (where k k is an operator
norm), then the series P ∞
k=0 Ak
converges absolutely, and it can be shown that its limit is
(I − A)
−1
.
Another interesting series is the logarithm. For any n × n complex matrix A, if k Ak < 1
(where k k is an operator norm), then the series
log(I + A) =
∞X
k=1
(−1)k+1Ak
k
converges absolutely.

Iterative Methods for Solving Linear
Systems
10.1 Convergence of Sequences of Vectors and Matri￾ces
In Chapter 8 we discussed some of the main methods for solving systems of linear equations.
These methods are direct methods, in the sense that they yield exact solutions (assuming
infinite precision!).
Another class of methods for solving linear systems consists in approximating solutions
using iterative methods. The basic idea is this: Given a linear system Ax = b (with A a
square invertible matrix in Mn(C)), find another matrix B ∈ Mn(C) and a vector c ∈ C
n
,
such that
1. The matrix I − B is invertible
2. The unique solution xe of the system Ax = b is identical to the unique solution ue of the
system
u = Bu + c,
and then starting from any vector u0, compute the sequence (uk) given by
uk+1 = Buk + c, k ∈ N.
Under certain conditions (to be clarified soon), the sequence (uk) converges to a limit ue
which is the unique solution of u = Bu + c, and thus of Ax = b.
Consequently, it is important to find conditions that ensure the convergence of the above
sequences and to have tools to compare the “rate” of convergence of these sequences. Thus,
we begin with some general results about the convergence of sequences of vectors and ma￾trices.
375
376 CHAPTER 10. ITERATIVE METHODS FOR SOLVING LINEAR SYSTEMS
Let (E, k k ) be a normed vector space. Recall from Section 9.7 that a sequence (uk) of
vectors uk ∈ E converges to a limit u ∈ E, if for every  > 0, there some natural number N
such that
k
uk − uk ≤ , for all k ≥ N.
We write
u = lim
k7→∞
uk.
If E is a finite-dimensional vector space and dim(E) = n, we know from Theorem 9.5 that
any two norms are equivalent, and if we choose the norm k k ∞, we see that the convergence
of the sequence of vectors uk is equivalent to the convergence of the n sequences of scalars
formed by the components of these vectors (over any basis). The same property applies to
the finite-dimensional vector space Mm,n(K) of m × n matrices (with K = R or K = C),
which means that the convergence of a sequence of matrices Ak = (a
(
ij
k)
) is equivalent to the
convergence of the m × n sequences of scalars (a
(
ij
k)
), with i, j fixed (1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n).
The first theorem below gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence (Bk
)
of powers of a matrix B to converge to the zero matrix. Recall that the spectral radius ρ(B)
of a matrix B is the maximum of the moduli |λi
| of the eigenvalues of B.
Theorem 10.1. For any square matrix B, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) limk7→∞ Bk = 0,
(2) limk7→∞ Bk
v = 0, for all vectors v,
(3) ρ(B) < 1,
(4) k Bk < 1, for some subordinate matrix norm k k .
Proof. Assume (1) and let k k be a vector norm on E and k k be the corresponding matrix
norm. For every vector v ∈ E, because k k is a matrix norm, we have
k
B
k
vk ≤ kB
k
kk
vk ,
and since limk7→∞ Bk = 0 means that limk7→∞ k Bkk = 0, we conclude that limk7→∞ k Bk
vk = 0,
that is, limk7→∞ Bk
v = 0. This proves that (1) implies (2).
Assume (2). If we had ρ(B) ≥ 1, then there would be some eigenvector u (6= 0) and some
eigenvalue λ such that
Bu = λu, |λ| = ρ(B) ≥ 1,
but then the sequence (Bku) would not converge to 0, because Bku = λ
ku and |λ
k
| = |λ|
k ≥
1. It follows that (2) implies (3).
Assume that (3) holds, that is, ρ(B) < 1. By Proposition 9.12, we can find  > 0 small
enough that ρ(B) +  < 1, and a subordinate matrix norm k k such that
k
Bk ≤ ρ(B) + ,
10.1. CONVERGENCE OF SEQUENCES OF VECTORS AND MATRICES 377
which is (4).
Finally, assume (4). Because k k is a matrix norm,
k
B
k
k ≤ kBk
k
,
and since k Bk < 1, we deduce that (1) holds.
The following proposition is needed to study the rate of convergence of iterative methods.
Proposition 10.2. For every square matrix B ∈ Mn(C) and every matrix norm k k , we
have
lim
k7→∞
k
B
k
k 1/k = ρ(B).
Proof. We know from Proposition 9.6 that ρ(B) ≤ kBk , and since ρ(B) = (ρ(Bk
))1/k, we
deduce that
ρ(B) ≤ kB
k
k 1/k for all k ≥ 1.
Now let us prove that for every  > 0, there is some integer N( ) such that
k
B
k
k 1/k ≤ ρ(B) +  for all k ≥ N( ).
Together with the fact that
ρ(B) ≤ kB
k
k 1/k for all k ≥ 1,
we deduce that limk7→∞ k Bkk 1/k exists and that
lim
k7→∞
k
B
k
k 1/k = ρ(B).
For any given  > 0, let B be the matrix
B =
B
ρ(B) +  .
Since ρ(B ) < 1, Theorem 10.1 implies that limk7→∞ Bk = 0. Consequently, there is some
integer N( ) such that for all k ≥ N( ), we have
k
B
k
k =
k
Bkk
(ρ(B) +  )
k
≤ 1,
which implies that
k
B
k
k 1/k ≤ ρ(B) + ,
as claimed.
We now apply the above results to the convergence of iterative methods.
378 CHAPTER 10. ITERATIVE METHODS FOR SOLVING LINEAR SYSTEMS
10.2 Convergence of Iterative Methods
Recall that iterative methods for solving a linear system Ax = b (with A ∈ Mn(C) invertible)
consists in finding some matrix B and some vector c, such that I − B is invertible, and the
unique solution xe of Ax = b is equal to the unique solution ue of u = Bu + c. Then starting
from any vector u0, compute the sequence (uk) given by
uk+1 = Buk + c, k ∈ N,
and say that the iterative method is convergent iff
lim
k7→∞
uk = u, e
for every initial vector u0.
Here is a fundamental criterion for the convergence of any iterative methods based on a
matrix B, called the matrix of the iterative method.
Theorem 10.3. Given a system u = Bu+c as above, where I −B is invertible, the following
statements are equivalent:
(1) The iterative method is convergent.
(2) ρ(B) < 1.
(3) k Bk < 1, for some subordinate matrix norm k k .
Proof. Define the vector ek (error vector ) by
ek = uk − u, e
where ue is the unique solution of the system u = Bu + c. Clearly, the iterative method is
convergent iff
lim
k7→∞
ek = 0.
We claim that
ek = B
k
e0, k ≥ 0,
where e0 = u0 − ue.
This is proven by induction on k. The base case k = 0 is trivial. By the induction
hypothesis, ek = Bk
e0, and since uk+1 = Buk + c, we get
uk+1 − ue = Buk + c − u, e
and because ue = Bue + c and ek = Bk
e0 (by the induction hypothesis), we obtain
uk+1 − ue = Buk − Bue = B(uk − ue) = Bek = BBk
e0 = B
k+1e0,
proving the induction step. Thus, the iterative method converges iff
lim
k7→∞
B
k
e0 = 0.
Consequently, our theorem follows by Theorem 10.1.
10.2. CONVERGENCE OF ITERATIVE METHODS 379
The next proposition is needed to compare the rate of convergence of iterative methods.
It shows that asymptotically, the error vector ek = Bk
e0 behaves at worst like (ρ(B))k
.
Proposition 10.4. Let k k be any vector norm, let B ∈ Mn(C) be a matrix such that I − B
is invertible, and let ue be the unique solution of u = Bu + c.
(1) If (uk) is any sequence defined iteratively by
uk+1 = Buk + c, k ∈ N,
then
lim
k7→∞ 
sup
k
u0−uek =1
k
uk − uek
1/k = ρ(B).
(2) Let B1 and B2 be two matrices such that I − B1 and I − B2 are invertible, assume
that both u = B1u + c1 and u = B2u + c2 have the same unique solution ue, and consider any
two sequences (uk) and (vk) defined inductively by
uk+1 = B1uk + c1
vk+1 = B2vk + c2,
with u0 = v0. If ρ(B1) < ρ(B2), then for any  > 0, there is some integer N( ), such that
for all k ≥ N( ), we have

k

k

ρ(B2)
ρ(B1) +  .
Proof. Let k k be the subordinate matrix norm. Recall that
uk − ue = B
k
e0,
with e0 = u0 − ue. For every k ∈ N, we have
(ρ(B))k = ρ(B
k

k
k = sup

k

k

and Statement (1) follows from Proposition 10.2.
Because u0 = v0, we have
uk − ue = B1
k
e0
vk − ue = B2
k
e0,
380 CHAPTER 10. ITERATIVE METHODS FOR SOLVING LINEAR SYSTEMS
with e0 = u0 −ue = v0 −ue. Again, by Proposition 10.2, for every  > 0, there is some natural
number N( ) such that if k ≥ N( ), then
sup
k
e0k =1
k
B1
k
e0k
1/k ≤ ρ(B1) + .
Furthermore, for all k ≥ N( ), there exists a vector e0 = e0(k) (for some suitable choice of
u0) such that
k
e0k = 1 and k B2
k
e0k
1/k = k B2
k
k 1/k ≥ ρ(B2),
which implies Statement (2).
In light of the above, we see that when we investigate new iterative methods, we have to
deal with the following two problems:
1. Given an iterative method with matrix B, determine whether the method is conver￾gent. This involves determining whether ρ(B) < 1, or equivalently whether there is a
subordinate matrix norm such that k Bk < 1. By Proposition 9.11, this implies that
I − B is invertible (since k − Bk = k Bk , Proposition 9.11 applies).
2. Given two convergent iterative methods, compare them. The iterative method which
is faster is that whose matrix has the smaller spectral radius.
We now discuss three iterative methods for solving linear systems:
1. Jacobi’s method
2. Gauss–Seidel’s method
3. The relaxation method.
10.3 Description of the Methods of Jacobi,
Gauss–Seidel, and Relaxation
The methods described in this section are instances of the following scheme: Given a linear
system Ax = b, with A invertible, suppose we can write A in the form
A = M − N,
with M invertible, and “easy to invert,” which means that M is close to being a diagonal or
a triangular matrix (perhaps by blocks). Then Au = b is equivalent to

Therefore, we are in the situation described in the previous sections with B = M−1N and
c = M−1
b. In fact, since A = M − N, we have
B = M−1N = M−1
(M − A) = I − M−1A, (∗)
which shows that I − B = M−1A is invertible. The iterative method associated with the
matrix B = M−1N is given by
uk+1 = M−1Nuk + M−1
b, k ≥ 0, (†)
starting from any arbitrary vector u0. From a practical point of view, we do not invert M,
and instead we solve iteratively the systems
Muk+1 = Nuk + b, k ≥ 0.
Various methods correspond to various ways of choosing M and N from A. The first two
methods choose M and N as disjoint submatrices of A, but the relaxation method allows
some overlapping of M and N.
To describe the various choices of M and N, it is convenient to write A in terms of three
submatrices D, E, F, as
A = D − E − F,
where the only nonzero entries in D are the diagonal entries in A, the only nonzero entries
in E are the negatives of nonzero entries in A below the the diagonal, and the only nonzero
entries in F are the negatives of nonzero entries in A above the diagonal. More explicitly, if

In Jacobi’s method, we assume that all diagonal entries in A are nonzero, and we pick
M = D
N = E + F,
so that by (∗),
B = M−1N = D

(E + F) = I − D

As a matter of notation, we let
J = I − D
−1A = D

(E + F),
which is called Jacobi’s matrix . The corresponding method, Jacobi’s iterative method, com￾putes the sequence (uk) using the recurrence
