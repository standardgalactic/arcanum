Let N = (0, 0, 1) be the north pole on the sphere S
2
. Then it is not hard to show that
SO(2) is precisely the subgroup of SO(3) that leaves N fixed. As a consequence, all
rotations QR in the coset Q SO(2) map N to the same point QN ∈ S
2
, and it can be
shown that there is a bijection between the cosets of SO(2) in SO(3) and the points
on S
2
. The surjectivity of this map has to do with the fact that the action of SO(3)
on S
2
is transitive, which means that for any point x ∈ S
2
, there is some rotation
Q ∈ SO(3) such that QN = x.
It is tempting to define a multiplication operation on left cosets (or right cosets) by
setting
(g1H)(g2H) = (g1g2)H,
but this operation is not well defined in general, unless the subgroup H possesses a special
property. In Example 2.3, it is possible to define multiplication of cosets in (1), but it is not
possible in (2) and (3).
The property of the subgroup H that allows defining a multiplication operation on left
cosets is typical of the kernels of group homomorphisms, so we are led to the following
definition.
Definition 2.7. Given any two groups G and G0 , a function ϕ: G → G0 is a homomorphism
iff
ϕ(g1g2) = ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2), for all g1, g2 ∈ G.
Taking g1 = g2 = e (in G), we see that
ϕ(e) = e
0 ,
and taking g1 = g and g2 = g
−1
, we see that
ϕ(g
−1
) = (ϕ(g))−1
.
30 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
Example 2.4.
1. The map ϕ: Z → Z/nZ given by ϕ(m) = m mod n for all m ∈ Z is a homomorphism.
2. The map det: GL(n, R) → R is a homomorphism because det(AB) = det(A) det(B)
for any two matrices A, B. Similarly, the map det: O(n) → R is a homomorphism.
If ϕ: G → G0 and ψ: G0 → G00 are group homomorphisms, then ψ ◦ ϕ: G → G00 is also
a homomorphism. If ϕ: G → G0 is a homomorphism of groups, and if H ⊆ G, H0 ⊆ G0 are
two subgroups, then it is easily checked that
Im ϕ = ϕ(H) = {ϕ(g) | g ∈ H}
is a subgroup of G0 and
ϕ
−1
(H
0 ) = {g ∈ G | ϕ(g) ∈ H
0 }
is a subgroup of G. In particular, when H0 = {e
0 }, we obtain the kernel, Ker ϕ, of ϕ.
Definition 2.8. If ϕ: G → G0 is a homomorphism of groups, and if H ⊆ G is a subgroup
of G, then the subgroup of G0 ,
Im ϕ = ϕ(H) = {ϕ(g) | g ∈ H},
is called the image of H by ϕ, and the subgroup of G,
Ker ϕ = {g ∈ G | ϕ(g) = e
0 },
is called the kernel of ϕ.
Example 2.5.
1. The kernel of the homomorphism ϕ: Z → Z/nZ is nZ.
2. The kernel of the homomorphism det: GL(n, R) → R is SL(n, R). Similarly, the kernel
of the homomorphism det: O(n) → R is SO(n).
The following characterization of the injectivity of a group homomorphism is used all the
time.
Proposition 2.9. If ϕ: G → G0 is a homomorphism of groups, then ϕ: G → G0 is injective
iff Ker ϕ = {e}. (We also write Ker ϕ = (0).)
Proof. Assume ϕ is injective. Since ϕ(e) = e
0 , if ϕ(g) = e
0 , then ϕ(g) = ϕ(e), and by
injectivity of ϕ we must have g = e, so Ker ϕ = {e}.
Conversely, assume that Ker ϕ = {e}. If ϕ(g1) = ϕ(g2), then by multiplication on the
left by (ϕ(g1))−1 we get
e
0 = (ϕ(g1))−1ϕ(g1) = (ϕ(g1))−1ϕ(g2),
2.1. GROUPS, SUBGROUPS, COSETS 31
and since ϕ is a homomorphism (ϕ(g1))−1 = ϕ(g1
−1
), so
e
0 = (ϕ(g1))−1ϕ(g2) = ϕ(g1
−1
)ϕ(g2) = ϕ(g1
−1
g2).
This shows that g1
−1
g2 ∈ Ker ϕ, but since Ker ϕ = {e} we have g1
−1
g2 = e, and thus g2 = g1,
proving that ϕ is injective.
Definition 2.9. We say that a group homomorphism ϕ: G → G0 is an isomorphism if there
is a homomorphism ψ: G0 → G, so that
ψ ◦ ϕ = idG and ϕ ◦ ψ = idG0 . (†)
If ϕ is an isomorphism we say that the groups G and G0 are isomorphic. When G0 = G, a
group isomorphism is called an automorphism.
The reasoning used in the proof of Proposition 2.2 shows that if a a group homomorphism
ϕ: G → G0 is an isomorphism, then the homomorphism ψ: G0 → G satisfying Condition (†)
is unique. This homomorphism is denoted ϕ
−1
.
The left translations Lg and the right translations Rg are automorphisms of G.
Suppose ϕ: G → G0 is a bijective homomorphism, and let ϕ
−1 be the inverse of ϕ (as a
function). Then for all a, b ∈ G, we have
ϕ(ϕ
−1
(a)ϕ
−1
(b)) = ϕ(ϕ
−1
(a))ϕ(ϕ
−1
(b)) = ab,
and so
ϕ
−1
(ab) = ϕ
−1
(a)ϕ
−1
(b),
which proves that ϕ
−1
is a homomorphism. Therefore, we proved the following fact.
Proposition 2.10. A bijective group homomorphism ϕ: G → G0 is an isomorphism.
Observe that the property
gH = Hg, for all g ∈ G. (∗)
is equivalent by multiplication on the right by g
−1
to
gHg−1 = H, for all g ∈ G,
and the above is equivalent to
gHg−1 ⊆ H, for all g ∈ G. (∗∗)
This is because gHg−1 ⊆ H implies H ⊆ g
−1Hg, and this for all g ∈ G.
Proposition 2.11. Let ϕ: G → G0 be a group homomorphism. Then H = Ker ϕ satisfies
Property (∗∗), and thus Property (∗).
32 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
Proof. We have
ϕ(ghg−1
) = ϕ(g)ϕ(h)ϕ(g
−1
) = ϕ(g)e
0 ϕ(g)
−1 = ϕ(g)ϕ(g)
−1 = e
0 ,
for all h ∈ H = Ker ϕ and all g ∈ G. Thus, by definition of H = Ker ϕ, we have gHg−1 ⊆
H.
Definition 2.10. For any group G, a subgroup N of G is a normal subgroup of G iff
gNg−1 = N, for all g ∈ G.
This is denoted by N C G.
Proposition 2.11 shows that the kernel Ker ϕ of a homomorphism ϕ: G → G0 is a normal
subgroup of G.
Observe that if G is abelian, then every subgroup of G is normal.

Clearly AQA−1 ∈/ V , which shows that the Klein four group is not a normal subgroup of
GL(2, R).
The reader should check that the subgroups nZ, GL+
(n, R), SL(n, R), and SO(n, R) as
a subgroup of O(n, R), are normal subgroups.
If N is a normal subgroup of G, the equivalence relation ∼ induced by left cosets (see
Definition 2.5) is the same as the equivalence induced by right cosets. Furthermore, this
equivalence relation is a congruence, which means that: For all g1, g2, g1
0
, g2
0 ∈ G,
34 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
(1) If g1N = g1
0N and g2N = g2
0N, then g1g2N = g1
0
g2
0N, and
(2) If g1N = g2N, then g1
−1N = g2
−1N.
As a consequence, we can define a group structure on the set G/ ∼ of equivalence classes
modulo ∼, by setting
(g1N)(g2N) = (g1g2)N.
Definition 2.11. Let G be a group and N be a normal subgroup of G. The group obtained
by defining the multiplication of (left) cosets by
(g1N)(g2N) = (g1g2)N, g1, g2 ∈ G
is denoted G/N, and called the quotient of G by N. The equivalence class gN of an element
g ∈ G is also denoted g (or [g]). The map π : G → G/N given by
π(g) = g = gN
is a group homomorphism called the canonical projection.
Since the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup, we obtain the following very
useful result.
Proposition 2.12. Given a homomorphism of groups ϕ: G → G0 , the groups G/Ker ϕ and
Im ϕ = ϕ(G) are isomorphic.
Proof. Since ϕ is surjective onto its image, we may assume that ϕ is surjective, so that
G0 = Im ϕ. We define a map ϕ: G/Ker ϕ → G0 as follows:
ϕ(g) = ϕ(g), g ∈ G.
We need to check that the definition of this map does not depend on the representative
chosen in the coset g = g Ker ϕ, and that it is a homomorphism. If g
0 is another element in
the coset g Ker ϕ, which means that g
0 = gh for some h ∈ Ker ϕ, then
ϕ(g
0 ) = ϕ(gh) = ϕ(g)ϕ(h) = ϕ(g)e
0 = ϕ(g),
since ϕ(h) = e
0 as h ∈ Ker ϕ. This shows that
ϕ(g
0 ) = ϕ(g
0 ) = ϕ(g) = ϕ(g),
so the map ϕ is well defined. It is a homomorphism because
ϕ(gg
0 ) = ϕ(gg0 )
= ϕ(gg0 )
= ϕ(g)ϕ(g
0 )
= ϕ(g)ϕ(g
0 ).
The map ϕ is injective because ϕ(g) = e
0 iff ϕ(g) = e
0 iff g ∈ Ker ϕ, iff g = e. The map ϕ
is surjective because ϕ is surjective. Therefore ϕ is a bijective homomorphism, and thus an
isomorphism, as claimed.
2.2. CYCLIC GROUPS 35
Proposition 2.12 is called the first isomorphism theorem.
A useful way to construct groups is the direct product construction.
Definition 2.12. Given two groups G an H, we let G × H be the Cartestian product of the
sets G and H with the multiplication operation · given by
(g1, h1) · (g2, h2) = (g1g2, h1h2).
It is immediately verified that G × H is a group called the direct product of G and H.
Similarly, given any n groups G1, . . . , Gn, we can define the direct product G1 × · · · × Gn
is a similar way.
If G is an abelian group and H1, . . . , Hn are subgroups of G, the situation is simpler.
Consider the map
a: H1 × · · · × Hn → G
given by
a(h1, . . . , hn) = h1 + · · · + hn,
using + for the operation of the group G. It is easy to verify that a is a group homomorphism,
so its image is a subgroup of G denoted by H1 + · · · + Hn, and called the sum of the groups
Hi
. The following proposition will be needed.
Proposition 2.13. Given an abelian group G, if H1 and H2 are any subgroups of G such
that H1 ∩ H2 = {0}, then the map a is an isomorphism
a: H1 × H2 → H1 + H2.
Proof. The map is surjective by definition, so we just have to check that it is injective. For
this, we show that Ker a = {(0, 0)}. We have a(a1, a2) = 0 iff a1 + a2 = 0 iff a1 = −a2. Since
a1 ∈ H1 and a2 ∈ H2, we see that a1, a2 ∈ H1 ∩ H2 = {0}, so a1 = a2 = 0, which proves that
Ker a = {(0, 0)}.
Under the conditions of Proposition 2.13, namely H1 ∩ H2 = {0}, the group H1 + H2 is
called the direct sum of H1 and H2; it is denoted by H1 ⊕ H2, and we have an isomorphism
H1 × H2
∼= H1 ⊕ H2.
2.2 Cyclic Groups
Given a group G with unit element 1, for any element g ∈ G and for any natural number
n ∈ N, we define g
n as follows:
g
0 = 1
g
n+1 = g · g
n
.
36 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
For any integer n ∈ Z, we define g
n by
g
n =
(
g
n
if n ≥ 0
(g
−1
)
(−n)
if n < 0.
The following properties are easily verified:
g
i
· g
j = g
i+j
(g
i
)
−1 = g
−i
g
i
· g
j = g
j
· g
i
,
for all i, j ∈ Z.
Define the subset h gi of G by
h
gi = {g
n
| n ∈ Z}.
The following proposition is left as an exercise.
Proposition 2.14. Given a group G, for any element g ∈ G, the set h gi is the smallest
abelian subgroup of G containing g.
Definition 2.13. A group G is cyclic iff there is some element g ∈ G such that G = h gi .
An element g ∈ G with this property is called a generator of G.
The Klein four group V of Example 2.2 is abelian, but not cyclic. This is because V has
four elements, but all the elements different from the identity have order 2.
Cyclic groups are quotients of Z. For this, we use a basic property of Z. Recall that for
any n ∈ Z, we let nZ denote the set of multiples of n,
nZ = {nk | k ∈ Z}.
Proposition 2.15. Every subgroup H of Z is of the form H = nZ for some n ∈ N.
Proof. If H is the trivial group {0}, then let n = 0. If H is nontrivial, for any nonzero element
m ∈ H, we also have −m ∈ H and either m or −m is positive, so let n be the smallest
positive integer in H. By Proposition 2.14, nZ is the smallest subgroup of H containing n.
For any m ∈ H with m 6 = 0, we can write
m = nq + r, with 0 ≤ r < n.
Now, since nZ ⊆ H, we have nq ∈ H, and since m ∈ H, we get r = m − nq ∈ H. However,
0 ≤ r < n, contradicting the minimality of n, so r = 0, and H = nZ.
2.2. CYCLIC GROUPS 37
Given any cyclic group G, for any generator g of G, we can define a mapping ϕ: Z → G
by ϕ(m) = g
m. Since g generates G, this mapping is surjective. The mapping ϕ is clearly a
group homomorphism, so let H = Ker ϕ be its kernel. By a previous observation, H = nZ
for some n ∈ Z, so by the first homomorphism theorem, we obtain an isomorphism
ϕ: Z/nZ −→ G
from the quotient group Z/nZ onto G. Obviously, if G has finite order, then |G| = n. In
summary, we have the following result.
Proposition 2.16. Every cyclic group G is either isomorphic to Z, or to Z/nZ, for some
natural number n > 0. In the first case, we say that G is an infinite cyclic group, and in the
second case, we say that G is a cyclic group of order n.
The quotient group Z/nZ consists of the cosets m+nZ = {m+nk | k ∈ Z}, with m ∈ Z,
that is, of the equivalence classes of Z under the equivalence relation ≡ defined such that
x ≡ y iff x − y ∈ nZ iff x ≡ y (mod n).
We also denote the equivalence class x + nZ of x by x, or if we want to be more precise by
[x]n. The group operation is given by
x + y = x + y.
For every x ∈ Z, there is a unique representative, x mod n (the nonnegative remainder of
the division of x by n) in the class x of x, such that 0 ≤ x mod n ≤ n − 1. For this
reason, we often identity Z/nZ with the set {0, . . . , n−1}. To be more rigorous, we can give
{0, . . . , n − 1} a group structure by defining +n such that
x +n y = (x + y) mod n.
Then, it is easy to see that {0, . . . , n − 1} with the operation +n is a group with identity
element 0 isomorphic to Z/nZ.
We can also define a multiplication operation · on Z/nZ as follows:
a · b = ab = ab mod n.
Then, it is easy to check that · is abelian, associative, that 1 is an identity element for ·, and
that · is distributive on the left and on the right with respect to addition. This makes Z/nZ
into a commutative ring. We usually suppress the dot and write a b instead of a · b.
Proposition 2.17. Given any integer n ≥ 1, for any a ∈ Z, the residue class a ∈ Z/nZ is
invertible with respect to multiplication iff gcd(a, n) = 1.
38 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
Proof. If a has inverse b in Z/nZ, then a b = 1, which means that
ab ≡ 1 (mod n),
that is ab = 1 + nk for some k ∈ Z, which is the Bezout identity
ab − nk = 1
and implies that gcd(a, n) = 1. Conversely, if gcd(a, n) = 1, then by Bezout’s identity there
exist u, v ∈ Z such that
au + nv = 1,
so au = 1 − nv, that is,
au ≡ 1 (mod n),
which means that a u = 1, so a is invertible in Z/nZ.
Definition 2.14. The group (under multiplication) of invertible elements of the ring Z/nZ
is denoted by (Z/nZ)
∗
. Note that this group is abelian and only defined if n ≥ 2.
The Euler ϕ-function plays an important role in the theory of the groups (Z/nZ)
∗
.
Definition 2.15. Given any positive integer n ≥ 1, the Euler ϕ-function (or Euler totient
function) is defined such that ϕ(n) is the number of integers a, with 1 ≤ a ≤ n, which are
relatively prime to n; that is, with gcd(a, n) = 1.1
Then, by Proposition 2.17, we see that the group (Z/nZ)
∗ has order ϕ(n).
For n = 2, (Z/2Z)
∗ = {1}, the trivial group. For n = 3, (Z/3Z)
∗ = {1, 2}, and for
n = 4, we have (Z/4Z)
∗ = {1, 3}. Both groups are isomorphic to the group {−1, 1}. Since
gcd(a, n) = 1 for every a ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} iff n is prime, by Proposition 2.17 we see that
(Z/nZ)
∗ = Z/nZ − {0} iff n is prime.
2.3 Rings and Fields
The groups Z, Q, R, C, Z/nZ, and Mn(R) are more than abelian groups, they are also
commutative rings. Furthermore, Q, R, and C are fields. We now introduce rings and fields.
Definition 2.16. A ring is a set A equipped with two operations +: A × A → A (called
addition) and ∗: A × A → A (called multiplication) having the following properties:
(R1) A is an abelian group w.r.t. +;
(R2) ∗ is associative and has an identity element 1 ∈ A;
1We allow a = n to accomodate the special case n = 1.
2.3. RINGS AND FIELDS 39
(R3) ∗ is distributive w.r.t. +.
The identity element for addition is denoted 0, and the additive inverse of a ∈ A is
denoted by −a. More explicitly, the axioms of a ring are the following equations which hold
for all a, b, c ∈ A:
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c (associativity of +) (2.1)
a + b = b + a (commutativity of +) (2.2)
a + 0 = 0 + a = a (zero) (2.3)
a + (−a) = (−a) + a = 0 (additive inverse) (2.4)
a ∗ (b ∗ c) = (a ∗ b) ∗ c (associativity of ∗) (2.5)
a ∗ 1 = 1 ∗ a = a (identity for ∗) (2.6)
(a + b) ∗ c = (a ∗ c) + (b ∗ c) (distributivity) (2.7)
a ∗ (b + c) = (a ∗ b) + (a ∗ c) (distributivity) (2.8)
The ring A is commutative if
a ∗ b = b ∗ a for all a, b ∈ A.
From (2.7) and (2.8), we easily obtain
a ∗ 0 = 0 ∗ a = 0 (2.9)
a ∗ (−b) = (−a) ∗ b = −(a ∗ b). (2.10)
Note that (2.9) implies that if 1 = 0, then a = 0 for all a ∈ A, and thus, A = {0}. The
ring A = {0} is called the trivial ring. A ring for which 1 6 = 0 is called nontrivial. The
multiplication a ∗ b of two elements a, b ∈ A is often denoted by ab.
Example 2.6.
1. The additive groups Z, Q, R, C, are commutative rings.
2. For any positive integer n ∈ N, the group Z/nZ is a group under addition. We can
also define a multiplication operation by
a · b = ab = ab mod n,
for all a, b ∈ Z. The reader will easily check that the ring axioms are satisfied, with 0
as zero and 1 as multiplicative unit. The resulting ring is denoted by Z/nZ.
2
3. The group R[X] of polynomials in one variable with real coefficients is a ring under
multiplication of polynomials. It is a commutative ring.
2The notation Zn is sometimes used instead of Z/nZ but it clashes with the notation for the n-adic
integers so we prefer not to use it.

4. Let d be any positive integer. If d is not divisible by any integer of the form m2
, with
m ∈ N and m ≥ 2, then we say that d is square-free. For example, d = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10
are square-free, but 4, 8, 9, 12 are not square-free. If d is any square-free integer and if
d ≥ 2, then the set of real numbers
Z[
√
d] = {a + b
√
d ∈ R | a, b ∈ Z}
is a commutative a ring. If z = a + b
√
d ∈ Z[
√
d], we write z = a − b
√
d. Note that
zz = a
2 − db2
.
5. Similarly, if d ≥ 1 is a positive square-free integer, then the set of complex numbers
Z[
√
−d] = {a + ib√
d ∈ C | a, b ∈ Z}
is a commutative ring. If z = a + ib√
d ∈ Z[
√
−d], we write z = a − ib√
d. Note that
zz = a
2 + db2
. The case where d = 1 is a famous example that was investigated by
Gauss, and Z[
√
−1], also denoted Z[i], is called the ring of Gaussian integers.
6. The group of n × n matrices Mn(R) is a ring under matrix multiplication. However, it
is not a commutative ring.
7. The group C(a, b) of continuous functions f : (a, b) → R is a ring under the operation
f · g defined such that
(f · g)(x) = f(x)g(x)
for all x ∈ (a, b).
Definition 2.17. Given a ring A, for any element a ∈ A, if there is some element b ∈ A
such that b 6 = 0 and ab = 0, then we say that a is a zero divisor . A ring A is an integral
domain (or an entire ring) if 0 6 = 1, A is commutative, and ab = 0 implies that a = 0 or
b = 0, for all a, b ∈ A. In other words, an integral domain is a nontrivial commutative ring
with no zero divisors besides 0.
Example 2.7.
1. The rings Z, Q, R, C, are integral domains.
2. The ring R[X] of polynomials in one variable with real coefficients is an integral domain.
3. For any positive integer, n ∈ N, we have the ring Z/nZ. Observe that if n is composite,
then this ring has zero-divisors. For example, if n = 4, then we have
2 · 2 ≡ 0 (mod 4).
The reader should prove that Z/nZ is an integral domain iff n is prime (use Proposition
2.17).
2.3. RINGS AND FIELDS 41
4. If d is a square-free positive integer and if d ≥ 2, the ring Z[
√
d] is an integral domain.
Similarly, if d ≥ 1 is a square-free positive integer, the ring Z[
√
−d] is an integral
domain. Finding the invertible elements of these rings is a very interesting problem.
5. The ring of n × n matrices Mn(R) has zero divisors.
A homomorphism between rings is a mapping preserving addition and multiplication
(and 0 and 1).
Definition 2.18. Given two rings A and B, a homomorphism between A and B is a function
h: A → B satisfying the following conditions for all x, y ∈ A:
h(x + y) = h(x) + h(y)
h(xy) = h(x)h(y)
h(0) = 0
h(1) = 1.
Actually, because B is a group under addition, h(0) = 0 follows from
h(x + y) = h(x) + h(y).
Example 2.8.
1. If A is a ring, for any integer n ∈ Z, for any a ∈ A, we define n · a by
n · a = a + · · · + a
|
{z
}
n
if n ≥ 0 (with 0 · a = 0) and
n · a = −(−n) · a
if n < 0. Then, the map h: Z → A given by
h(n) = n · 1A
is a ring homomorphism (where 1A is the multiplicative identity of A).
2. Given any real λ ∈ R, the evaluation map ηλ : R[X] → R defined by
ηλ(f(X)) = f(λ)
for every polynomial f(X) ∈ R[X] is a ring homomorphism.
Definition 2.19. A ring homomorphism h: A → B is an isomorphism iff there is a ring
homomorphism g : B → A such that g ◦ f = idA and f ◦ g = idB. An isomorphism from a
ring to itself is called an automorphism.
42 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
As in the case of a group isomorphism, the homomorphism g is unique and denoted by
h
−1
, and it is easy to show that a bijective ring homomorphism h: A → B is an isomorphism.
Definition 2.20. Given a ring A, a subset A0 of A is a subring of A if A0 is a subgroup of
A (under addition), is closed under multiplication, and contains 1.
For example, we have the following sequence in which every ring on the left of an inlcusion
sign is a subring of the ring on the right of the inclusion sign:
Z ⊆ Q ⊆ R ⊆ C.
The ring Z is a subring of both Z[
√
d] and Z[
√
−d], the ring Z[
√
d] is a subring of R and the
ring Z[
√
−d] is a subring of C.
If h: A → B is a homomorphism of rings, then it is easy to show for any subring A0 , the
image h(A0 ) is a subring of B, and for any subring B0 of B, the inverse image h
−1
(B0 ) is a
subring of A.
As for groups, the kernel of a ring homomorphism h: A → B is defined by
Ker h = {a ∈ A | h(a) = 0}.
Just as in the case of groups, we have the following criterion for the injectivity of a ring
homomorphism. The proof is identical to the proof for groups.
Proposition 2.18. If h: A → B is a homomorphism of rings, then h: A → B is injective
iff Ker h = {0}. (We also write Ker h = (0).)
The kernel of a ring homomorphism is an abelian subgroup of the additive group A, but
in general it is not a subring of A, because it may not contain the multiplicative identity
element 1. However, it satisfies the following closure property under multiplication:
ab ∈ Ker h and ba ∈ Ker h for all a ∈ Ker h and all b ∈ A.
This is because if h(a) = 0, then for all b ∈ A we have
h(ab) = h(a)h(b) = 0h(b) = 0 and h(ba) = h(b)h(a) = h(b)0 = 0.
Definition 2.21. Given a ring A, an additive subgroup I of A satisfying the property below
ab ∈ I and ba ∈ I for all a ∈ I and all b ∈ A (∗ideal)
is called a two-sided ideal. If A is a commutative ring, we simply say an ideal.
It turns out that for any ring A and any two-sided ideal I, the set A/I of additive cosets
a + I (with a ∈ A) is a ring called a quotient ring. Then we have the following analog of
Proposition 2.12, also called the first isomorphism theorem.
2.3. RINGS AND FIELDS 43
Proposition 2.19. Given a homomorphism of rings h: A → B, the rings A/Ker h and
Im h = h(A) are isomorphic.
A field is a commutative ring K for which K − {0} is a group under multiplication.
Definition 2.22. A set K is a field if it is a ring and the following properties hold:
(F1) 0 6 = 1;
(F2) For every a ∈ K, if a 6 = 0, then a has an inverse w.r.t. ∗;
(F3) ∗ is commutative.
Let K∗ = K − {0}. Observe that (F1) and (F2) are equivalent to the fact that K∗
is a
group w.r.t. ∗ with identity element 1. If ∗ is not commutative but (F1) and (F2) hold, we
say that we have a skew field (or noncommutative field).
Note that we are assuming that the operation ∗ of a field is commutative. This convention
is not universally adopted, but since ∗ will be commutative for most fields we will encounter,
we may as well include this condition in the definition.
Example 2.9.
1. The rings Q, R, and C are fields.
2. The set of (formal) fractions f(X)/g(X) of polynomials f(X), g(X) ∈ R[X], where
g(X) is not the null polynomial, is a field.
3. The ring C(a, b) of continuous functions f : (a, b) → R such that f(x) 6 = 0 for all
x ∈ (a, b) is a field.
4. Using Proposition 2.17, it is easy to see that the ring Z/pZ is a field iff p is prime.
5. If d is a square-free positive integer and if d ≥ 2, the set
Q(
√
d) = {a + b
√
d ∈ R | a, b ∈ Q}
is a field. If z = a + b
√
d ∈ Q(
√
d) and z = a − b
√
d, then it is easy to check that if
z 6 = 0, then z
−1 = z/(zz).
6. Similarly, If d ≥ 1 is a square-free positive integer, the set of complex numbers
Q(
√
−d) = {a + ib√
d ∈ C | a, b ∈ Q}
is a field. If z = a + ib√
d ∈ Q(
√
−d) and z = a − ib√
d, then it is easy to check that
if z 6 = 0, then z
−1 = z/(zz).
44 CHAPTER 2. GROUPS, RINGS, AND FIELDS
Definition 2.23. A homomorphism h: K1 → K2 between two fields K1 and K2 is just a
homomorphism between the rings K1 and K2.
However, because K1
∗ and K2
∗ are groups under multiplication, a homomorphism of fields
must be injective.
Proof. First, observe that for any x 6 = 0,
1 = h(1) = h(xx−1
) = h(x)h(x
−1
)
and
1 = h(1) = h(x
−1x) = h(x
−1
)h(x),
so h(x) 6 = 0 and
h(x
−1
) = h(x)
−1
.
But then, if h(x) = 0, we must have x = 0. Consequently, h is injective.
Definition 2.24. A field homomorphism h: K1 → K2 is an isomorphism iff there is a
homomorphism g : K2 → K1 such that g ◦ f = idK1 and f ◦ g = idK2
. An isomorphism from
a field to itself is called an automorphism.
Then, just as in the case of rings, g is unique and denoted by h
−1
, and a bijective field
homomorphism h: K1 → K2 is an isomorphism.
Definition 2.25. Since every homomorphism h: K1 → K2 between two fields is injective,
the image f(K1) of K1 is a subfield of K2. We say that K2 is an extension of K1.
For example, R is an extension of Q and C is an extension of R. The fields Q(
√
d) and
Q(
√
−d) are extensions of Q, the field R is an extension of Q(
√
d) and the field C is an
extension of Q(
√
−d).
Definition 2.26. A field K is said to be algebraically closed if every polynomial p(X) with
coefficients in K has some root in K; that is, there is some a ∈ K such that p(a) = 0.
It can be shown that every field K has some minimal extension Ω which is algebraically
closed, called an algebraic closure of K. For example, C is the algebraic closure of R. The
algebraic closure of Q is called the field of algebraic numbers. This field consists of all
complex numbers that are zeros of a polynomial with coefficients in Q.
Definition 2.27. Given a field K and an automorphism h: K → K of K, it is easy to check
that the set
Fix(h) = {a ∈ K | h(a) = a}
of elements of K fixed by h is a subfield of K called the field fixed by h.
2.3. RINGS AND FIELDS 45
For example, if d ≥ 2 is square-free, then the map c : Q(
√
d) → Q(
√
d) given by
c(a + b
√
d) = a − b
√
d
is an automorphism of Q(
√
d), and Fix(c) = Q.
If K is a field, we have the ring homomorphism h: Z → K given by h(n) = n · 1. If h
is injective, then K contains a copy of Z, and since it is a field, it contains a copy of Q. In
this case, we say that K has characteristic 0. If h is not injective, then h(Z) is a subring of
K, and thus an integral domain, the kernel of h is a subgroup of Z, which by Proposition
2.15 must be of the form pZ for some p ≥ 1. By the first isomorphism theorem, h(Z) is
isomorphic to Z/pZ for some p ≥ 1. But then, p must be prime since Z/pZ is an integral
domain iff it is a field iff p is prime. The prime p is called the characteristic of K, and we
also says that K is of finite characteristic.
Definition 2.28. If K is a field, then either
(1) n · 1 6 = 0 for all integer n ≥ 1, in which case we say that K has characteristic 0, or
(2) There is some smallest prime number p such that p · 1 = 0 called the characteristic of
K, and we say K is of finite characteristic.
A field K of characteristic 0 contains a copy of Q, thus is infinite. As we will see in
Section 8.10, a finite field has nonzero characteristic p. However, there are infinite fields of
nonzero characteristic.

Vector Spaces, Bases, Linear Maps
3.1 Motivations: Linear Combinations, Linear Inde￾pendence and Rank
In linear optimization problems, we often encounter systems of linear equations. For example,
consider the problem of solving the following system of three linear equations in the three
variables x1, x2, x3 ∈ R:
x1 + 2x2 − x3 = 1
2x1 + x2 + x3 = 2
x1 − 2x2 − 2x3 = 3.
One way to approach this problem is introduce the “vectors” u, v, w, and b, given by
u =


1
2
1

 v =



 b =


1

3


and to write our linear system as
x1u + x2v + x3w = b.
In the above equation, we used implicitly the fact that a vector z can be multiplied by a
scalar λ ∈ R, where
λz = λ

and two vectors y and and z can be added, where
