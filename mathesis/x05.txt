Example 3.7. Given any differentiable function f : R
n → R, by definition, for any x ∈ R
n

the total derivative dfx of f at x is the linear form dfx : R

Example 3.8. Let C([0, 1]) be the vector space of continuous functions f : [0, 1] → R. The
map I : C([0, 1]) → R given by
I(f) = Z
1
0
f(x)dx for any f ∈ C([0, 1])
is a linear form (integration).
Example 3.9. Consider the vector space Mn(R) of real n×n matrices. Let tr: Mn(R) → R
be the function given by
tr(A) = a11 + a22 + · · · + ann,
called the trace of A. It is a linear form. Let s: Mn(R) → R be the function given by
s(A) =
nX
i,j=1
aij ,
where A = (aij ). It is immediately verified that s is a linear form.
Given a vector space E and any basis (ui)i∈I for E, we can associate to each ui a linear
form u
∗
i ∈ E
∗
, and the u
∗
i have some remarkable properties.
Definition 3.27. Given a vector space E and any basis (ui)i∈I for E, by Proposition 3.18,
for every i ∈ I, there is a unique linear form u
∗
i
such that
u

i
(uj ) =  1 if
0 if
i
i

j,
for every j ∈ I. The linear form u
∗
i
is called the coordinate form of index i w.r.t. the basis
(ui)i∈I .
Remark: Given an index set I, authors often define the so called “Kronecker symbol” δi j
such that
δi j =

1 if
0 if
i
i
=
6
=
j
j,
for all i, j ∈ I. Then, u
∗
i
(uj ) = δi j .
3.9. LINEAR FORMS AND THE DUAL SPACE 103
The reason for the terminology coordinate form is as follows: If E has finite dimension
and if (u1, . . . , un) is a basis of E, for any vector
v = λ1u1 + · · · + λnun,
we have
u
∗
i
(v) = u
∗
i
(λ1u1 + · · · + λnun)
= λ1u
∗
i
(u1) + · · · + λiu
∗
i
(ui) + · · · + λnu
∗
i
(un)
= λi
,
since u
∗
i
(uj ) = δi j . Therefore, u
∗
i
is the linear function that returns the ith coordinate of a
vector expressed over the basis (u1, . . . , un).
The following theorem shows that in finite-dimension, every basis (u1, . . . , un) of a vector
space E yields a basis (u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
) of the dual space E
∗
, called a dual basis.
Theorem 3.23. (Existence of dual bases) Let E be a vector space of dimension n. The
following properties hold: For every basis (u1, . . . , un) of E, the family of coordinate forms
(u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
) is a basis of E
∗
(called the dual basis of (u1, . . . , un)).
Proof. (a) If v
∗ ∈ E
∗
is any linear form, consider the linear form
f
∗ = v
∗
(u1)u
∗
1 + · · · + v
∗
(un)u
∗
n
.
Observe that because u
∗
i
(uj ) = δi j ,
f
∗
(ui) = (v
∗
(u1)u
∗
1 + · · · + v
∗
(un)u
∗
n
)(ui)
= v
∗
(u1)u
∗
1
(ui) + · · · + v
∗
(ui)u
∗
i
(ui) + · · · + v
∗
(un)u
∗
n
(ui)
= v
∗
(ui),
and so f
∗ and v
∗ agree on the basis (u1, . . . , un), which implies that
v
∗ = f
∗ = v
∗
(u1)u
∗
1 + · · · + v
∗
(un)u
∗
n
.
Therefore, (u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
) spans E
∗
. We claim that the covectors u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
are linearly inde￾pendent. If not, we have a nontrivial linear dependence
λ1u
∗
1 + · · · + λnu
∗
n = 0,
and if we apply the above linear form to each ui
, using a familar computation, we get
0 = λiu
∗
i
(ui) = λi
,
proving that u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
are indeed linearly independent. Therefore, (u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
) is a basis of
E
∗
.
104 CHAPTER 3. VECTOR SPACES, BASES, LINEAR MAPS
In particular, Theorem 3.23 shows a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual E
∗ have
the same dimension.
We explained just after Definition 3.26 that if the space E is finite-dimensional and has
a finite basis (u1, . . . , un), then a linear form f
∗
: E → K is represented by the row vector of
coefficients
￾
f
∗
(u1) · · · f
∗
(un)
 . (1)
The proof of Theorem 3.23 shows that over the dual basis (u
∗
1
, . . . , u∗
n
) of E
∗
, the linear form
f
∗
is represented by the same coefficients, but as the column vector


which is the transpose of the row vector in (1).
3.10 Summary
The main concepts and results of this chapter are listed below:
• The notion of a vector space.
• Families of vectors.
• Linear combinations of vectors; linear dependence and linear independence of a family
of vectors.
• Linear subspaces.
• Spanning (or generating) family; generators, finitely generated subspace; basis of a
subspace.
• Every linearly independent family can be extended to a basis (Theorem 3.7).
• A family B of vectors is a basis iff it is a maximal linearly independent family iff it is
a minimal generating family (Proposition 3.8).
• The replacement lemma (Proposition 3.10).
• Any two bases in a finitely generated vector space E have the same number of elements;
this is the dimension of E (Theorem 3.11).
• Hyperplanes.

multiplication on this set by
(x1, y1, u1) · (x2, y2, u2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2, eix1y2 u1u2),
then G is a group and ϕ is a group homomorphism from H onto G.
(4) The kernel of a homomorphism ϕ: G1 → G2 is defined as
Ker (ϕ) = {a ∈ G1 | ϕ(a) = e2}.
Find explicitly the kernel of ϕ and show that it is a subgroup of H.
Problem 3.2. For any m ∈ Z with m > 0, the subset mZ = {mk | k ∈ Z} is an abelian
subgroup of Z. Check this.

(2) Check that the inclusion map i: mZ → Z given by i(mk) = mk is a group homomor￾phism. Prove that if m ≥ 2 then there is no group homomorphism p: Z → mZ such that
p ◦ i = id.
Remark: The above shows that abelian groups fail to have some of the properties of vector
spaces. We will show later that a linear map satisfying the condition p ◦ i = id always exists.

for which Axiom V4 fails.
(4) For any operation ·: R×R

for every rational number r ∈ Q and every vector x ∈ R

(x1, . . . , xn), and
r(1 · x) = (ry1, . . . , ryn),

Use (4) to conclude that any operation ·: Q×R

Matrices and Linear Maps
In this chapter, all vector spaces are defined over an arbitrary field K. For the sake of
concreteness, the reader may safely assume that K = R.
4.1 Representation of Linear Maps by Matrices
Proposition 3.18 shows that given two vector spaces E and F and a basis (uj )j∈J of E, every
linear map f : E → F is uniquely determined by the family (f(uj ))j∈J of the images under
f of the vectors in the basis (uj )j∈J .
If we also have a basis (vi)i∈I of F, then every vector f(uj ) can be written in a unique
way as
f(uj ) = X
i∈I
ai jvi
,
where j ∈ J, for a family of scalars (ai j )i∈I . Thus, with respect to the two bases (uj )j∈J
of E and (vi)i∈I of F, the linear map f is completely determined by a “I × J-matrix”
M(f) = (ai j )(i,j)∈I×J .
Remark: Note that we intentionally assigned the index set J to the basis (uj )j∈J of E, and
the index set I to the basis (vi)i∈I of F, so that the rows of the matrix M(f) associated
with f : E → F are indexed by I, and the columns of the matrix M(f) are indexed by J.
Obviously, this causes a mildly unpleasant reversal. If we had considered the bases (ui)i∈I of
E and (vj )j∈J of F, we would obtain a J × I-matrix M(f) = (aj i)(j,i)∈J×I
. No matter what
we do, there will be a reversal! We decided to stick to the bases (uj )j∈J of E and (vi)i∈I of
F, so that we get an I × J-matrix M(f), knowing that we may occasionally suffer from this
decision!
When I and J are finite, and say, when |I| = m and |J| = n, the linear map f is
determined by the matrix M(f) whose entries in the j-th column are the components of the

whose entry on Row i and Column j is ai j (1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n).
We will now show that when E and F have finite dimension, linear maps can be very
conveniently represented by matrices, and that composition of linear maps corresponds to
matrix multiplication. We will follow rather closely an elegant presentation method due to
Emil Artin.
Let E and F be two vector spaces, and assume that E has a finite basis (u1, . . . , un) and
that F has a finite basis (v1, . . . , vm). Recall that we have shown that every vector x ∈ E
can be written in a unique way as
x = x1u1 + · · · + xnun,
and similarly every vector y ∈ F can be written in a unique way as
y = y1v1 + · · · + ymvm.
Let f : E → F be a linear map between E and F. Then for every x = x1u1 + · · · + xnun in
E, by linearity, we have
f(x) = x1f(u1) + · · · + xnf(un).
Let
f(uj ) = a1 jv1 + · · · + am jvm,
or more concisely,
f(uj ) =
mX
i=1
ai jvi
,
for every j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. This can be expressed by writing the coefficients a1j
, a2j
, . . . , amj of
f(uj ) over the basis (v1, . . . , vm), as the jth column of a matrix, as shown below:
f(u1) f(u2) . . . f(un)

Then substituting the right-hand side of each f(uj ) into the expression for f(x), we get
f(x) = x1(

i=1
ai 1vi) + · · · + xn(
mX

, yields
f(x) = (

Thus, letting f(x) = y = y1v1 + · · · + ymvm, we have

To make things more concrete, let us treat the case where n = 3 and m = 2. In this case,
f(u1) = a11v1 + a21v2
f(u2) = a12v1 + a22v2
f(u3) = a13v1 + a23v2,
which in matrix form is expressed by
f(u1) f(u2) f(u3)

,
and for any x = x1u1 + x2u2 + x3u3, we have
f(x) = f(x1u1 + x2u2 + x3u3)
= x1f(u1) + x2f(u2) + x3f(u3)
= x1(a11v1 + a21v2) + x2(a12v1 + a22v2) + x3(a13v1 + a23v2)
= (a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3)v1 + (a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3)v2.
Consequently, since
y = y1v1 + y2v2,
we have
y1 = a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3
y2 = a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3.
This agrees with the matrix equation
