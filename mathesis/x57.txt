−→E . The pair (a0,(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am)) is also called an affine frame with origin a0. Then, every
x ∈ E can be expressed as
x = a0 + x1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + xm
−−→a0am
for a unique family (x1, . . . , xm) of scalars, called the coordinates of x w.r.t. the affine frame
(a0,(
−−→a0a1, . . .,
−−→a0am)). Furthermore, every x ∈ E can be written as
x = λ0a0 + · · · + λmam
for some unique family (λ0, . . . , λm) of scalars such that λ0+· · ·+λm = 1 called the barycentric
coordinates of x with respect to the affine frame (a0, . . . , am). See Figure 24.15.
The coordinates (x1, . . . , xm) and the barycentric coordinates (λ0, . . ., λm) are related by
the equations λ0 = 1 −
P

i=1 xi and λi = xi
, for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. An affine frame is called an
affine basis by some authors. A family (ai)i∈I of points in E is affinely dependent if it is not
affinely independent. We can also characterize affinely dependent families as follows.

Proposition 24.6. Given an affine space 
 E,

The family (ai)i∈I is affinely dependent iff there is a family (λi)i∈I such that λj 6 = 0 for some
j ∈ I,
P
i∈I
λi = 0, and P i∈I
λi
−→xai = 0 for every x ∈ E.
Proof. By Proposition 24.5, the family (ai)i∈I is affinely dependent iff the family of vectors
(
−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is linearly dependent for some i ∈ I. For any i ∈ I, the family (−−→aiaj )j∈(I−{i})
is linearly dependent iff there is a family (λj )j∈(I−{i}) such that λj 6 = 0 for some j, and such
that
X

Then, for any x ∈ E, we have

λi = 0 implies that λj 6 = 0, for some j 6 = i.

Even though Proposition 24.6 is rather dull, it is one of the key ingredients in the proof
of beautiful and deep theorems about convex sets, such as Carath´eodory’s theorem, Radon’s
theorem, and Helly’s theorem.
A family of two points (a, b) in E is affinely independent iff −→ab 6 = 0, iff a 6 = b. If a 6 = b, the
affine subspace generated by a and b is the set of all points (1−λ)a+λb, which is the unique
line passing through a and b. A family of three points (a, b, c) in E is affinely independent
iff −→ab and −→ac are linearly independent, which means that a, b, and c are not on the same line
(they are not collinear). In this case, the affine subspace generated by (a, b, c) is the set of all
points (1 − λ − µ)a + λb + µc, which is the unique plane containing a, b, and c. A family of
four points (a, b, c, d) in E is affinely independent iff −→ab,
−→ac, and
−→ad are linearly independent,
which means that a, b, c, and d are not in the same plane (they are not coplanar). In this
case, a, b, c, and d are the vertices of a tetrahedron. Figure 24.16 shows affine frames and
their convex hulls for |I| = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Given n+1 affinely independent points (a0, . . . , an) in E, we can consider the set of points
λ0a0 +· · ·+λnan, where λ0 +· · ·+λn = 1 and λi ≥ 0 (λi ∈ R). Such affine combinations are
called convex combinations. This set is called the convex hull of (a0, . . . , an) (or n-simplex
spanned by (a0, . . . , an)). When n = 1, we get the segment between a0 and a1, including
a0 and a1. When n = 2, we get the interior of the triangle whose vertices are a0, a1, a2,
including boundary points (the edges). When n = 3, we get the interior of the tetrahedron
818 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
whose vertices are a0, a1, a2, a3, including boundary points (faces and edges). The set
{a0 + λ1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + λn
−−→a0an | where 0 ≤ λi ≤ 1 (λi ∈ R)}
is called the parallelotope spanned by (a0, . . . , an). When E has dimension 2, a parallelotope
is also called a parallelogram, and when E has dimension 3, a parallelepiped. Figure 24.17
shows the convex hulls and associated parallelotopes for |I| = 0, 1, 2, 3.

More generally, we say that a subset V of E is convex if for any two points a, b ∈ V , we
have c ∈ V for every point c = (1 − λ)a + λb, with 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 (λ ∈ R).

Points are not vectors! The following example illustrates why treating points as
vectors may cause problems. Let a, b, c be three affinely independent points in A
3
.
Any point x in the plane (a, b, c) can be expressed as
x = λ0a + λ1b + λ2c,
where λ0 + λ1 + λ2 = 1. How can we compute λ0, λ1, λ2? Letting a = (a1, a2, a3), b =
(b1, b2, b3), c = (c1, c2, c3), and x = (x1, x2, x3) be the coordinates of a, b, c, x in the standard
frame of A
3
, it is tempting to solve the system of equations

However, there is a problem when the origin of the coordinate system belongs to the plane
(a, b, c), since in this case, the matrix is not invertible! What we should really be doing is to
solve the system
λ0
−→Oa + λ1
−→Ob + λ2
−→Oc =
−→Ox,
where O is any point not in the plane (a, b, c). An alternative is to use certain well-chosen
cross products.
It can be shown that barycentric coordinates correspond to various ratios of areas and
volumes; see the problems.
24.7 Affine Maps
Corresponding to linear maps we have the notion of an affine map. An affine map is defined
as a map preserving affine combinations.
Definition 24.6. Given two affine spaces 
 E,
−→E , +
 and 
 E
0 ,
−→
E
0 , +0
 , a function f : E → E
0
is an affine map iff for every family ((ai
, λi))i∈I of weighted points in E such that P i∈I
λi = 1,
we have
f
 
X
i∈I
λiai
! =
X
i∈I
λif(ai).
In other words, f preserves barycenters.
Affine maps can be obtained from linear maps as follows. For simplicity of notation, the
same symbol + is used for both affine spaces (instead of using both + and +0 ).
Proposition 24.7. Given any point a ∈ E, any point b ∈ E
0 , and any linear map h:
−→E →
−→
E
0 , the map f : E → E
0 defined such that
f(a + v) = b + h(v)
is an affine map.
Proof. Indeed, for any family (λi)i∈I of scalars with P i∈I
λi = 1 and any family (vi)i∈I , since
X
i∈I
λi(a + vi) = a +

and

λi(b + h(vi)) = b +
X
i∈I
λi
−−−−−−−→
b(b + h(vi)) = b +

we have

i∈I
λih(vi)
=
X
i∈I
λi(b + h(vi))
=
X
i∈I
λif(a + vi),
as claimed.
Note that the condition P i∈I
λi = 1 was implicitly used (in a hidden call to Proposition
24.1) in deriving that
X
i∈I
λi(a + vi) = a +
X
i∈I
λivi
and
X
i∈I
λi(b + h(vi)) = b +

i∈I
λih(vi).

this affine map is the composition of a shear, followed by a rotation of angle π/4, followed by
a magnification of ratio √

The following proposition shows the converse of what we just showed. Every affine map
is determined by the image of any point and a linear map.
Proposition 24.8. Given an affine map f : E → E
0 , there is a unique linear map
−→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 such that
f(a + v) = f(a) + −→f (v),
for every a ∈ E and every v ∈
−→E .
Proof. Let a ∈ E be any point in E. We claim that the map defined such that
−→f (v) = −−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v)
822 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
for every v ∈
−→E is a linear map
−→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 . Indeed, we can write
a + λv = λ(a + v) + (1 − λ)a,
since a + λv = a + λ
−−−−−→
a(a + v) + (1 − λ)
−→aa, and also
a + u + v = (a + u) + (a + v) − a,
since a + u + v = a +
−−−−−→
a(a + u) + −−−−−→
a(a + v) −
−→aa. Since f preserves barycenters, we get
f(a + λv) = λf(a + v) + (1 − λ)f(a).
If we recall that x =
P i∈I
λiai
is the barycenter of a family ((ai
, λi))i∈I of weighted points
(with P i∈I
λi = 1) iff
−→bx =
X
i∈I
λi
−→bai
for every b ∈ E,
we get
−−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + λv) = λ
−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v) + (1 − λ)
−−−−−→
f(a)f(a) = λ
−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v),
showing that
−→f (λv) = λ
−→f (v). We also have
f(a + u + v) = f(a + u) + f(a + v) − f(a),
from which we get
−−−−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + u + v) = −−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + u) + −−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v),
showing that
−→f (u + v) = −→f (u) + −→f (v). Consequently, −→f is a linear map. For any other
point b ∈ E, since
b + v = a +
−→ab + v = a +
−−−−−→
a(a + v) −
−→aa +
−→ab,
b + v = (a + v) − a + b, and since f preserves barycenters, we get
f(b + v) = f(a + v) − f(a) + f(b),
which implies that
−−−−−−−−→
f(b)f(b + v) =
−−−−−−−−→
f(b)f(a + v) −
−−−−−→
f(b)f(a) +
−−−−−→
f(b)f(b),
=
−−−−−→
f(a)f(b) + −−−−−−−−→
f(b)f(a + v),
=
−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v).
Thus,
−−−−−−−−→
f(b)f(b + v) = −−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v), which shows that the definition of −→f does not depend
on the choice of a ∈ E. The fact that −→f is unique is obvious: We must have
−→f (v) =
−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + v).
24.7. AFFINE MAPS 823
The unique linear map
−→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 given by Proposition 24.8 is called the linear map
associated with the affine map f.
Note that the condition
f(a + v) = f(a) + −→f (v),
for every a ∈ E and every v ∈
−→E , can be stated equivalently as
f(x) = f(a) + −→f (
−→ax), or
−−−−−→
f(a)f(x) = −→f (
−→ax),
for all a, x ∈ E. Proposition 24.8 shows that for any affine map f : E → E
0 , there are points
a ∈ E, b ∈ E
0 , and a unique linear map
−→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 , such that
f(a + v) = b +
−→f (v),
for all v ∈
−→E (just let b = f(a), for any a ∈ E). Affine maps for which −→f is the identity
map are called translations. Indeed, if −→f = id,
f(x) = f(a) + −→f (
−→ax) = f(a) + −→ax = x +
−→xa +
−−−→
af(a) + −→ax
= x +
−→xa +
−−−→
af(a) −
−→xa = x +
−−−→
af(a),
and so −−−→
xf(x) = −−−→
af(a),
which shows that f is the translation induced by the vector
−−−→
af(a) (which does not depend
on a).
Since an affine map preserves barycenters, and since an affine subspace V is closed under
barycentric combinations, the image f(V ) of V is an affine subspace in E
0 . So, for example,
the image of a line is a point or a line, and the image of a plane is either a point, a line, or
a plane.
It is easily verified that the composition of two affine maps is an affine map. Also, given
affine maps f : E → E
0 and g : E
0 → E
00 , we have
g(f(a + v)) = g
 f(a) + −→f (v)
 = g(f(a)) + −→g

−→f (v)
 ,
which shows that
−−→
g ◦ f =
−→g ◦
−→f . It is easy to show that an affine map f : E → E
0 is injective
iff −→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 is injective, and that f : E → E
0 is surjective iff −→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 is surjective.
An affine map f : E → E
0 is constant iff −→f :
−→E →
−→
E
0 is the null (constant) linear map equal
to 0 for all v ∈
−→E .
If E is an affine space of dimension m and (a0, a1, . . . , am) is an affine frame for E, then
for any other affine space F and for any sequence (b0, b1, . . . , bm) of m + 1 points in F, there
824 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
is a unique affine map f : E → F such that f(ai) = bi
, for 0 ≤ i ≤ m. Indeed, f must be
such that
f(λ0a0 + · · · + λmam) = λ0b0 + · · · + λmbm,
where λ0+· · ·+λm = 1, and this defines a unique affine map on all of E, since (a0, a1, . . . , am)
is an affine frame for E.
Using affine frames, affine maps can be represented in terms of matrices. We explain how
an affine map f : E → E is represented with respect to a frame (a0, . . . , an) in E, the more
general case where an affine map f : E → F is represented with respect to two affine frames
(a0, . . . , an) in E and (b0, . . . , bm) in F being analogous. Since
f(a0 + x) = f(a0) + −→f (x)
for all x ∈
−→E , we have
−−−−−−−−→
a0f(a0 + x) = −−−−→
a0f(a0) + −→f (x).
Since x,
−−−−→
a0f(a0), and −−−−−−−−→
a0f(a0 + x), can be expressed as
x = x1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + xn
−−→a0an,
−−−−→
a0f(a0) = b1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + bn
−−→a0an,
−−−−−−−−→
a0f(a0 + x) = y1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + yn
−−→a0an,
if A = (ai j ) is the n×n matrix of the linear map −→f over the basis (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0an), letting x,
y, and b denote the column vectors of components (x1, . . . , xn), (y1, . . . , yn), and (b1, . . . , bn),
−−−−−−−−→
a0f(a0 + x) = −−−−→
a0f(a0) + −→f (x)
is equivalent to
y = Ax + b.
Note that b 6 = 0 unless f(a0) = a0. Thus, f is generally not a linear transformation, unless it
has a fixed point, i.e., there is a point a0 such that f(a0) = a0. The vector b is the “translation
part” of the affine map. Affine maps do not always have a fixed point. Obviously, nonnull
translations have no fixed point. A less trivial example is given by the affine map

There is a useful trick to convert the equation y = Ax + b into what looks like a linear
equation. The trick is to consider an (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrix. We add 1 as the (n + 1)th
component to the vectors x, y, and b, and form the (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrix

This trick is very useful in kinematics and dynamics, where A is a rotation matrix. Such
affine maps are called rigid motions.
If f : E → E
0 is a bijective affine map, given any three collinear points a, b, c in E,
with a 6 = b, where, say, c = (1 − λ)a + λb, since f preserves barycenters, we have f(c) =
(1−λ)f(a) +λf(b), which shows that f(a), f(b), f(c) are collinear in E
0 . There is a converse
to this property, which is simpler to state when the ground field is K = R. The converse
states that given any bijective function f : E → E
0 between two real affine spaces of the
same dimension n ≥ 2, if f maps any three collinear points to collinear points, then f is
affine. The proof is rather long (see Berger [11] or Samuel [142]).
Given three collinear points a, b, c, where a 6 = c, we have b = (1 − β)a + βc for some
unique β, and we define the ratio of the sequence a, b, c, as
ratio(a, b, c) = β

provided that β 6 = 1, i.e., b 6 = c. When b = c, we agree that ratio(a, b, c) = ∞. We warn our
readers that other authors define the ratio of a, b, c as −ratio(a, b, c) =

. Since affine maps
preserve barycenters, it is clear that affine maps preserve the ratio of three points.
24.8 Affine Groups
We now take a quick look at the bijective affine maps. Given an affine space E, the set of
affine bijections f : E → E is clearly a group, called the affine group of E, and denoted by
GA(E). Recall that the group of bijective linear maps of the vector space −→E is denoted by
GL(
−→E ). Then, the map f 7→
−→f defines a group homomorphism L: GA(E) → GL(
−→E ).
The kernel of this map is the set of translations on E.
The subset of all linear maps of the form λ id−→E
, where λ ∈ R − {0}, is a subgroup
of GL(
−→E ), and is denoted by R
∗
id−→E
(where λ id−→E
(u) = λu, and R
∗ = R − {0}). The
subgroup DIL(E) = L
−1
(R
∗
id−→E
) of GA(E) is particularly interesting. It turns out that it
is the disjoint union of the translations and of the dilatations of ratio λ 6 = 1. The elements
of DIL(E) are called affine dilatations.
Given any point a ∈ E, and any scalar λ ∈ R, a dilatation or central dilatation (or
homothety) of center a and ratio λ is a map Ha,λ defined such that
Ha,λ(x) = a + λ
−→ax,
for every x ∈ E.
Remark: The terminology does not seem to be universally agreed upon. The terms affine
dilatation and central dilatation are used by Pedoe [136]. Snapper and Troyer use the term
dilation for an affine dilatation and magnification for a central dilatation [162]. Samuel uses
homothety for a central dilatation, a direct translation of the French “homoth´etie” [142].
Since dilation is shorter than dilatation and somewhat easier to pronounce, perhaps we
should use that!
Observe that Ha,λ(a) = a, and when λ 6 = 0 and x 6 = a, Ha,λ(x) is on the line defined by
a and x, and is obtained by “scaling” −→ax by λ.
Figure 24.20 shows the effect of a central dilatation of center d. The triangle (a, b, c) is
magnified to the triangle (a
0 , b0 , c0 ). Note how every line is mapped to a parallel line.
When λ = 1, Ha,1 is the identity. Note that −−→Ha,λ = λ id−→E
. When λ 6 = 0, it is clear that
Ha,λ is an affine bijection. It is immediately verified that
Ha,λ ◦ Ha,µ = Ha,λµ.
We have the following useful result.

Proposition 24.9. Given any affine space E, for any affine bijection f ∈ GA(E), if −→f =
λ id−→E
, for some λ ∈ R
∗ with λ 6 = 1, then there is a unique point c ∈ E such that f = Hc,λ.
Proof. The proof is straightforward, and is omitted. It is also given in Gallier [70].
Clearly, if −→f = id−→E
, the affine map f is a translation. Thus, the group of affine
dilatations DIL(E) is the disjoint union of the translations and of the dilatations of ratio
λ 6 = 0, 1. Affine dilatations can be given a purely geometric characterization.
Another point worth mentioning is that affine bijections preserve the ratio of volumes of
parallelotopes. Indeed, given any basis B = (u1, . . . , um) of the vector space −→E associated
with the affine space E, given any m + 1 affinely independent points (a0, . . . , am), we can
compute the determinant detB(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) w.r.t. the basis B. For any bijective affine
map f : E → E, since

 detB(

and the determinant of a linear map is intrinsic (i.e., depends only on −→f , and not on the
particular basis B), we conclude that the ratio
detB

−−→a0a1), . . . ,

detB(

is independent of the basis B. Since detB(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) is the volume of the parallelotope
spanned by (a0, . . . , am), where the parallelotope spanned by any point a and the vectors

(u1, . . . , um) has unit volume (see Berger [11], Section 9.12), we see that affine bijections
preserve the ratio of volumes of parallelotopes. In fact, this ratio is independent of the
choice of the parallelotopes of unit volume. In particular, the affine bijections f ∈ GA(E)
such that det￾

 = 1 preserve volumes. These affine maps form a subgroup SA(E) of
GA(E) called the special affine group of E. We now take a glimpse at affine geometry.
24.9 Affine Geometry: A Glimpse
In this section we state and prove three fundamental results of affine geometry. Roughly
speaking, affine geometry is the study of properties invariant under affine bijections. We now
prove one of the oldest and most basic results of affine geometry, the theorem of Thales.
Proposition 24.10. Given any affine space E, if H1, H2, H3 are any three distinct parallel
hyperplanes, and A and B are any two lines not parallel to Hi, letting ai = Hi ∩ A and
bi = Hi ∩ B, then the following ratios are equal:
