The unique projective transformation mapping (p1, p2, p3, p4) to (q1, q2, q3, q4) is defined on
the convex hull of the points p1, p2, p3, p4 iff all four points p1, p2, p3, p4 are strictly contained
in one of the two open half spaces determined by the line of equation (∗), which means that
the affine form in (∗) must have the same sign on these four points.

The fourth case shows that the sign of the affine form in (∗) is positive, and thus λ1/α1,
λ2/α2, λ3/α3 > 0, which implies that the scalars in each of the pairs (α1, λ1), (α2, λ2) and
(α3, λ3), must have the same sign.
The generalization to any dimension n ≥ 2 is immediate: the scalars in each pair (αi
, λi)
must have the same sign for i = 1, . . . , n + 2.
In dimension 2, since α3 = 1 − α1 − α2 and λ3 = 1 − λ1 − λ2, there are four cases to
consider:
(1) α1, λ1, α2, λ2 < 0. In this case, α3, λ3 > 1 so α3, λ3 also have the same sign.
(2) α1, λ1 < 0 and α2, λ2 > 0. In this case, since α3 = 1 − α1 − α2 and λ3 = 1 − λ1 − λ2,
we must have either both α1 + α2 < 1 and λ1 + λ2 < 1, or both α1 + α2 > 1 and
λ1 + λ2 > 1, in order for α3 and λ3 to have the same sign.
(3) α1, λ1 > 0 and α2, λ2 < 0. As in the previous case, since α3 = 1 − α1 − α2 and
λ3 = 1 − λ1 − λ2, we must have either both α1 + α2 < 1 and λ1 + λ2 < 1, or both
α1 + α2 > 1 and λ1 + λ2 > 1, in order for α3 and λ3 to have the same sign.
(4) α1, λ1, α2, λ2 > 0. As in the previous case, since α3 = 1−α1 −α2 and λ3 = 1−λ1 −λ2,
we must have either both α1 + α2 < 1 and λ1 + λ2 < 1, or both α1 + α2 > 1 and
λ1 + λ2 > 1, in order for α3 and λ3 to have the same sign.
Since α3 = 1 − α1 − α2 and λ3 = 1 − λ1 − λ2, we can write
p4 = α1p1 + α2p2 + α3p3 = p3 + α1(p1 − p3) + α2(p2 − p3)
q4 = λ1q1 + λ2q2 + λ3q3 = q3 + λ1(q1 − q3) + λ2(q2 − q3).
In the affine frame (p3,(p1 − p3, p2 − p3)), points have coordinates (α1, α2), and in the affine
frame (q3,(q1 − q3, q2 − q3)), points have coordinates (λ1, λ2). In the first affine frame, the
line h p1, p2i is given by the equation α1 + α2 = 1, and in the second affine frame, the line
h
q1, q2i is given by the equation λ1 +λ2 = 1. The open half plane containing p3 and bounded
by the line h p1, p2i corresponds to the points of coordinates (α1, α2) satisfying α1 + α2 < 1,
and the other open half plane not containing p3 corresponds to the points of coordinates
(α1, α2) satisfying α1 + α2 > 1. Similarly, the open half plane containing q3 and bounded by
the line h q1, q2i corresponds to the points of coordinates (λ1, λ2) satisfying λ1 + λ2 < 1, and
the other open half plane not containing q3 corresponds to the points of coordinates (λ1, λ2)
satisfying λ1 + λ2 > 1.
Then, the above conditions have the following interpretation in terms of regions in the
affine plane z = 1:
(1) When α1 < 0 and α2 < 0, the point p4 lies in quadrant III (with respect to the affine
frames (p3,(p1 − p3, p2 − p3))). Under the mapping f, the point q4 is also mapped to
quadrant III (with respect to the affine frame (q3,(q1 −q3, q2 −q3))); see Figure 26.14.

Thus, if both (p1, p2, p3, p4) and (q1, q2, q3, q4) satisfy the conditions listed above, there is
no point at infinity inside of the convex hull of the quadrangle (p1, p2, p3, p4).
It remains to prove that the image of the convex hull of (p1, p2, p3, p4) is the convex hull
of (q1, q2, q3, q4).
Proposition 26.15. If both (p1, p2, p3, p4) and (q1, q2, q3, q4) satisfy the conditions of Propo￾sition 26.14, then the image of the convex hull of (p1, p2, p3, p4) under the unique projective
map mapping (p1, p2, p3, p4) to (q1, q2, q3, q4) is the convex hull of (q1, q2, q3, q4)

projective space, also denoted by Ee, has some very interesting properties. In fact, it satisfies
a universal property, but before we can say what it is, we have to take a closer look at Ee.
Since the vector space b E is the disjoint union of elements of the form h a, λi , where a ∈ E
and λ ∈ K − {0}, and elements of the form u ∈
−→E , observe that if ∼ is the equivalence
relation on b E used to define the projective space P
￾ Eb
 , then the equivalence class [h a, λi ]∼
of a weighted point contains the special representative a = h a, 1i , and the equivalence class
[u]∼ of a nonzero vector u ∈
−→E is just a point of the projective space P
￾
−→E
 . Thus, there is
a bijection
P
￾ Eb
 ←→ E ∪ P
￾
−→E

between P
￾ Eb
 and the disjoint union E ∪ P
￾
−→E
 , which allows us to view E as being
embedded in P
￾ Eb
 . The points of P
￾ Eb
 in P
￾
−→E
 will be called points at infinity, and the
projective hyperplane P
￾
−→E
 is called the hyperplane at infinity. We will also denote the
point [u]∼ of P
￾
−→E
 (where u 6 = 0) by u∞.
Thus, we can think of e E = P
￾ Eb
 as the projective completion of the affine space E
obtained by adding points at infinity forming the hyperplane P
￾
−→E
 . As we commented in
Section 26.2 when we presented the hyperplane model of P(E), the notion of point at infinity
is really an affine notion. But even if a vector space E doesn’t arise from the completion of
an affine space, there is an affine structure on the complement of any hyperplane P(H) in
the projective space P(E). In the case of e E, the complement E of the projective hyperplane
P
￾
−→E
 is indeed an affine space. This is a general property that is needed in order to figure
out the universal property of e E.
Proposition 26.16. Given a vector space E and a hyperplane H in E, the complement
EH = P(E) − P(H) of the projective hyperplane P(H) in the projective space P(E) can
be given an affine structure such that the associated vector space of EH is H. The affine
structure on EH depends only on H, and under this affine structure, EH is isomorphic to
an affine hyperplane in E.
Proof. Since H is a hyperplane in E, there is some w ∈ E−H such that E = Kw⊕H. Thus,
every vector u in E−H can be written in a unique way as λw+h, where λ 6 = 0 and h ∈ H. As
a consequence, for every point [u] in EH, the equivalence class [u] contains a representative
of the form w + λ
−1h, with λ 6 = 0. Then we see that the map ϕ: (w + H) → EH, defined
such that
ϕ(w + h) = [w + h],
is a bijection. In order to define an affine structure on EH, we define +: EH × H → EH as
follows: For every point [w + h1] ∈ EH and every h2 ∈ H, we let
[w + h1] + h2 = [w + h1 + h2].
The axioms of an affine space are immediately verified. Now, w + H is an affine hyperplane
is E, and under the affine structure just given to EH, the map ϕ: (w + H) → EH is an affine
26.7. AFFINE PATCHES 903
map that is bijective. Thus, EH is isomorphic to the affine hyperplane w + H. If we had
chosen a different vector w
0 ∈ E − H such that E = Kw0 ⊕ H, then EH would be isomorphic
to the affine hyperplane w
0 + H parallel to w + H. But these two hyperplanes are clearly
isomorphic by translation, and thus the affine structure on EH depends only on H.
An affine space of the form EH is called an affine patch on P(E). Proposition 26.16
allows us to view a projective space P(E) as the result of gluing some affine spaces together,
at least when E is of finite dimension. For example, when E is of dimension 2, a hyperplane
in E is just a line, and the complement of a point in the projective line P(E) can be viewed
as an affine line. Thus, we can view P(E) as being covered by two affine lines glued together
as illustrated by When K = R, this shows that topologically, the projective line RP1
is
equivalent to a circle. See Figure 26.18. When E is of dimension 3, a hyperplane in E is
y = 1
y = 0
Figure 26.18: The covering of RP1
by the affine lines y = 0 and y = 1.
just a plane, and the complement of a projective line in the projective plane P(E) can be
viewed as an affine plane. Thus, we can view P(E) as being covered by three affine planes
glued together as illustrated by Figure 26.19.
However, even when K = R, it is much more difficult to come up with a geometric
embedding of the projective plane RP2
in A
3
, and in fact, this is impossible! Nevertheless,
there are some fascinating immersions of the projective space RP2
as 3D surfaces with self￾intersection, one of which is known as the Boy surface. We urge our readers to consult the
remarkable book by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen [92] for drawings of the Boy surface, and more.
One should also consult Fischer’s books [61, 60], where many beautiful models of surfaces
are displayed, and the commentaries in Chapter 6 of [60] regarding models of RP2
. More
generally, when E is of dimension n + 1, the projective space P(E) is covered by n + 1 affine
patches (hyperplanes) glued together. This idea is very fruitful, since it allows the treatment
of projective spaces as manifolds, and it is essential in algebraic geometry.
We can now go back to the projective completion Ee of an affine space E.

26.8 Projective Completion of an Affine Space

an affine space (E,

space obtained associated with the vector space b E obtained from E by the hat construction
from Chapter 25 is indeed a projective completion of (E,
−→E ).
Definition 26.7. Given any affine space E with associated vector space −→E , a projective
completion of the affine space E with hyperplane at infinity P(H) is a triple h P(E), P(H), ii ,
where E is a vector space, H is a hyperplane in E, i: E → P(E) is an injective map such
that i(E) = EH and i is affine (where EH = P(E) − P(H) is an affine patch), and for every
projective space P(F) (where F is some vector space), every hyperplane H in F, and every
map f : E → P(F) such that f(E) ⊆ FH and f is affine (where FH = P(F) − P(H) is an

The points of P(E) in P(H) are called points at infinity, and the projective hyperplane
P(H) is called the hyperplane at infinity. We will also denote the point [u]∼ of P(H)
(where u 6 = 0) by u∞. As usual, objects defined by a universal property are unique up to
isomorphism. We leave the proof as an exercise.
The importance of the notion of projective completion stems from the fact that every
affine map f : E → F extends in a unique way to a projective map fe : P(E) → P(F), where
h
P(E), P(HE), iEi is a projective completion of E and h P(F), P(HF ), iF i is a projective
completion of F, provided that the restriction of e f to P

We will now show that 
 e E, P

−→E
 , i is the projective completion of E, where i: E → Ee
is the injection of E into e E = E ∪ P
￾

 . For example, if E = A

K is an affine line, its
projective completion f A1
K is isomorphic to the projective line P(K2
), and they both can be
identified with A
1
K ∪ {∞}, the result of adding a point at infinity (∞) to A

K. In general,
the projective completion Afm
K of the affine space A
m
K is isomorphic to P(Km+1). Thus, Afm
is isomorphic to RPm, and Afm
C
is isomorphic to CPm.
First, let us observe that if E is a vector space and H is a hyperplane in E, then the
homogenization EcH of the affine patch EH (the complement of the projective hyperplane
P(H) in P(E)) is isomorphic to E. The proof is rather simple and uses the fact that there
906 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
is an affine bijection between EH and the affine hyperplane w + H in E, where w ∈ E − H
is any fixed vector. Choosing w as an origin in EH, we know that EcH = H +b Kw, and since
E = H ⊕ Kw, it is obvious how to define a linear bijection between c EH = H b + Kw and
E = H ⊕ Kw. As a consequence the projective spaces EfH and P(E) are isomorphic, i.e.,
there is a projectivity between them.
Proposition 26.17. Given any affine space ￾ E,

F is some vector space), every hyperplane H in F, and every map f : E → P(F) such that

FH ⊆ P(F) ⊇ P(H)
Proof. The existence of fe is a consequence of Proposition 25.6, where we observe that FcH is
isomorphic to F. Just take the projective map P
￾ fb
 : Ee → P(F), where fb : Eb → F is the
unique linear map extending f. It remains to prove its uniqueness.
As explained in the proof of Proposition 26.16, the affine patch FH is affinely isomorphic
to some affine hyperplane of the form w + H for some w ∈ F − H. If we pick any a ∈ E,
since by hypothesis f(a) ∈ FH, we may assume that w ∈ F −H is chosen so that f(a) = [w],
and we have F = Kw ⊕ H. Since f : E → FH is affine, for any a ∈ E and any u ∈
−→E , we
have
f(a + u) = f(a) + −→f (u) = w +
−→f (u),
where
−→f :
−→E → H is a linear map, and where f(a) is viewed as the vector w.
Assume that fe : Ee → P(F) exists with the desired property. Then there is some linear
map g : b E → F such that e f = P(g). Our goal is to prove that g = µ bf for some nonzero
µ ∈ K. First, we prove that g vanishes on Ker
−→f .
Since f = fe ◦ i, we must have f(a) = [w] = [g(a)], and thus g(a) = µw, for some µ 6 = 0.
Also, for every u ∈
−→E ,
f(a + u) = [w] + −→f (u) =  w +
−→f (u)
 = [g(a + u)]
= [g(a) + g(u)] = [µw + g(u)],
26.8. PROJECTIVE COMPLETION OF AN AFFINE SPACE 907
and thus we must have
λ(u)w + λ(u)
−→f (u) = µw + g(u), (∗1)
for some λ(u) 6 = 0.
If Ker −→f =
−→E , the linear map
−→f is the null map, and since we are requiring that the
restriction of e f to P
￾
−→E
 be equal to P
￾
−→f
 , the linear map g must also be the null map
on
−→E . Thus, e f is unique, and the restriction of e f to P
￾
−→E
 is the partial map undefined
everywhere.
If −→E − Ker
−→f 6 = ∅, by taking a basis of Im −→f and some inverse image of this basis, we
obtain a basis B of a subspace −→G of −→E such that −→E = Ker
−→f ⊕
−→G. Since −→E = Ker
−→f ⊕
−→G
where dim￾ −→G
 ≥ 1, for any x ∈ Ker
−→f and any nonnull vector y ∈
−→G, we have
λ(x)w = µw + g(x),
λ(y)w + λ(y)
−→f (y) = µw + g(y),
and
λ(x + y)w + λ(x + y)
−→f (x + y) = µw + g(x + y),
which by linearity yields
(λ(x + y) − λ(x) − λ(y) + µ)w + (λ(x + y) − λ(y))−→f (y) = 0.
Since F = Kw ⊕ H and
−→f :
−→E → H, we must have λ(x + y) = λ(y) and λ(x) = µ. Then
the equation
λ(x)w = µw + g(x)
yields µw = µw + g(x), shows that g vanishes on Ker
−→f .
If dim￾ −→G
 = 1 then by (∗1), for any y ∈
−→G we have
λ(y)w + λ(y)
−→f (y) = µw + g(y),
and for any ν 6 = 0 we have
λ(νy)w + λ(νy)
−→f (νy) = µw + g(νy),
which by linearity yields
(λ(νy) − νλ(y) − µ + νµ)w + (νλ(νy) − νλ(y))−→f (y) = 0.
Since F = Kw ⊕ H,
−→f :
−→E → H, and ν 6 = 0, we must have λ(νy) = λ(y). Then we must
also have (λ(y) − µ)(1 − ν) = 0.
908 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
If K = {0, 1}, since the only nonzero scalar is 1, it is immediate that g(y) = −→f (y), and
we are done. Otherwise, for ν 6 = 0, 1, we get λ(y) = µ for all y ∈
−→G. Then equation
λ(y)w + λ(y)
−→f (y) = µw + g(y)
yields g = µ
−→f on G, and since g vanishes on Ker
−→f we get g = µ
−→f on
−→E and the restriction
of e f = P(g) to P
￾
−→E
 is equal to P
￾
−→f
 . But now, by Proposition 25.6 and since FcH is
isomorphic to F, the linear map b f is completely determined by
fb(u +b λa) = λf(a) + −→f (u) = λw +
−→f (u),
and g is completely determined by
g(u +b λa) = λg(a) + g(u) = λµw + µ
−→f (u).
Thus, we have g = µfb.
Otherwise, if dim￾ −→G
 ≥ 2, then for any two distinct basis vectors u and v in B,
λ(u)w + λ(u)
−→f (u) = µw + g(u),
λ(v)w + λ(v)
−→f (v) = µw + g(v),
and
λ(u + v)w + λ(u + v)
−→f (u + v) = µw + g(u + v),
and by linearity, we get
(λ(u + v) − λ(u) − λ(v) + µ)w + (λ(u + v) − λ(u))−→f (u) + (λ(u + v) − λ(v))−→f (v) = 0.
Since F = Kw ⊕ H,
−→f :
−→E → H, and
−→f (u) and −→f (v) are linearly independent (because −→f
in injective on
−→G), we must have
λ(u + v) = λ(u) = λ(v) = µ,
which implies that g = µ
−→f on
−→E , and the restriction of e f = P(g) to P
￾
−→E
 is equal to
P
￾
−→f
 . As in the previous case, g is completely determined by
g(u +b λa) = λg(a) + g(u) = λµw + µ
−→f (u).
Again, we have g = µfb, and thus fe is unique.
26.9. MAKING GOOD USE OF HYPERPLANES AT INFINITY 909

The requirement that the restriction of fe = P(g) to P
￾
−→E
 be equal to P
￾
−→f
 is
necessary for the uniqueness of fe. The problem comes up when f is a constant map.
Indeed, if f is the constant map defined such that f(a) = [w] for some fixed vector w ∈ F, it
can be shown that any linear map g : b E → F defined such that g(a) = µw and g(u) = ϕ(u)w
for all u ∈
−→E , for some µ 6 = 0, and some linear form ϕ:
−→E → F satisfies f = P(g) ◦ i.
Proposition 26.17 shows that 
 E, e P
￾
−→E
 , i is the projective completion of the affine space
E.
The projective completion Ee of an affine space E is a very handy place in which to do
geometry in, mainly because the following facts can be easily established.
There is a bijection between affine subspaces of E and projective subspaces of e E not
contained in P
￾
−→E
 . Two affine subspaces of E are parallel iff the corresponding projective
subspaces of e E have the same intersection with the hyperplane at infinity P
￾
−→E
 . There is
also a bijection between affine maps from E to F and projective maps from e E to e F mapping
the hyperplane at infinity P
￾
−→E
 into the hyperplane at infinity P
￾
−→F
 . In the projective
plane, two distinct lines intersect in a single point (possibly at infinity, when the lines are
parallel). In the projective space, two distinct planes intersect in a single line (possibly
at infinity, when the planes are parallel). In the projective space, a plane and a line not
contained in that plane intersect in a single point (possibly at infinity, when the plane and
the line are parallel).
26.9 Making Good Use of Hyperplanes at Infinity
Given a vector space E and a hyperplane H in E, we have already observed that the projec￾tive spaces EfH and P(E) are isomorphic. Thus, P(H) can be viewed as the hyperplane at
infinity in P(E), and the considerations applying to the projective completion of an affine
space apply to the affine patch EH on P(E). This fact yields a powerful and elegant method
for proving theorems in projective geometry. The general schema is to choose some projec￾tive hyperplane P(H) in P(E), view it as the “hyperplane at infinity,” then prove an affine
version of the desired result in the affine patch EH (the complement of P(H) in P(E), which
has an affine structure), and then transfer this result back to the projective space P(E).
This technique is often called “sending objects to infinity.” We refer the reader to geome￾try textbooks for a comprehensive development of these ideas (for example, Berger [11, 12],
Samuel [142], Sidler [161], Tisseron [175], or Pedoe [136]), but we cannot resist presenting
the projective versions of the theorems of Pappus and Desargues. Indeed, the method of
sending points to infinity provides some strikingly elegant proofs. We begin with Pappus’s
theorem, illustrated in Figure 26.20.
