34.6. THE HODGE ∗-OPERATOR 1213
Proposition 34.14. When E is finite dimensional, the maps µ:
V
n
(E
∗
) −→ Altn
(E; K)
induced by the linear extensions of the maps given by
µ(v1
∗ ∧ · · · ∧ vn
∗
)(u1, . . . , un) = det(vj
∗
(ui))
yield a canonical isomorphism of algebras µ:
V (E
∗
) −→ Alt(E), where the multiplication in
Alt(E) is defined by the maps ∧: Altm(E; K) × Altn
(E; K) −→ Altm+n
(E; K), with
(f ∧ g)(u1, . . . , um+n) = X
σ∈shuffle(m,n)
sgn(σ) f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(m))g(uσ(m+1), . . . , uσ(m+n)),
where shuffle(m, n) consists of all (m, n)-“shuffles,” that is, permutations σ of {1, . . . m +n}
such that σ(1) < · · · < σ(m) and σ(m + 1) < · · · < σ(m + n).
Remark: The algebra V (E) is a graded algebra. Given two graded algebras E and F, we
can make a new tensor product E b ⊗ F, where E b ⊗ F is equal to E ⊗ F as a vector space,
but with a skew-commutative multiplication given by
(a ⊗ b) ∧ (c ⊗ d) = (−1)deg(b)deg(c)
(ac) ⊗ (bd),
where a ∈ E
m, b ∈ F
p
, c ∈ E
n
, d ∈ F
q
. Then, it can be shown that
^
(E ⊕ F) ∼=
^ (E) ⊗b
^ (F).
34.6 The Hodge ∗-Operator
In order to define a generalization of the Laplacian that applies to differential forms on a
Riemannian manifold, we need to define isomorphisms
k
^
V −→
n−k
^
V,
for any Euclidean vector space V of dimension n and any k, with 0 ≤ k ≤ n. If h−, −i
denotes the inner product on V , we define an inner product on V k
V , denoted h−, −i∧, by
setting
h
u1 ∧ · · · ∧ uk, v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vki ∧ = det(h ui
, vj i ),
for all ui
, vi ∈ V , and extending h−, −i∧ by bilinearity.
It is easy to show that if (e1, . . . , en) is an orthonormal basis of V , then the basis of V k
V
consisting of the eI (where I = {i1, . . . , ik}, with 1 ≤ i1 < · · · < ik ≤ n) is an orthonormal
basis of V k
V . Since the inner product on V induces an inner product on V
∗
(recall that
h
ω1, ω2i = h ω1
]
, ω2
]
i
, for all ω1, ω2 ∈ V
∗
), we also get an inner product on V k
V
∗
.
1214 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
Definition 34.6. An orientation of a vector space V of dimension n is given by the choice
of some basis (e1, . . . , en). We say that a basis (u1, . . . , un) of V is positively oriented iff
det(u1, . . . , un) > 0 (where det(u1, . . . , un) denotes the determinant of the matrix whose jth
column consists of the coordinates of uj over the basis (e1, . . . , en)), otherwise it is negatively
oriented. An oriented vector space is a vector space V together with an orientation of V .
If V is oriented by the basis (e1, . . . , en), then V
∗
is oriented by the dual basis (e
∗
1
, . . . , e∗
n
).
If σ is any permutation of {1, . . . , n}, then the basis (eσ(1), . . . , eσ(n)) has positive orientation
iff the signature sgn(σ) of the permutation σ is even.
If V is an oriented vector space of dimension n, then we can define a linear isomorphism
∗:
k
^
V →
n−k
^
V,
called the Hodge ∗-operator . The existence of this operator is guaranteed by the following
proposition.
Proposition 34.15. Let V be any oriented Euclidean vector space whose orientation is given
by some chosen orthonormal basis (e1, . . . , en). For any alternating tensor α ∈
V
k
V , there
is a unique alternating tensor ∗α ∈
V
n−k
V such that
α ∧ β = h∗α, βi ∧ e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en
for all β ∈
V
n−k
V . The alternating tensor ∗α is independent of the choice of the positive
orthonormal basis (e1, . . . , en).
Proof. Since V n
V has dimension 1, the alternating tensor e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en is a basis of V n
V .
It follows that for any fixed α ∈
V
k
V , the linear map λα from V n−k
V to V n
V given by
λα(β) = α ∧ β
is of the form
λα(β) = fα(β) e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en
for some linear form fα ∈
￾
V
n−k
V

∗
. But then, by the duality induced by the inner product
h−, −i on V
n−k
V , there is a unique vector ∗α ∈
V
n−k
V such that
fλ(β) = h∗α, βi ∧ for all β ∈
V
n−k
V ,
which implies that
α ∧ β = λα(β) = fα(β) e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en = h∗α, βi ∧ e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en,
as claimed. If (e
01
, . . . , e0n
) is any other positively oriented orthonormal basis, by Proposition
34.2, e
01 ∧ · · · ∧ e
0n = det(P) e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en = e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en, since det(P) = 1 where P is the
change of basis from (e1, . . . , en) to (e
01
, . . . , e0n
) and both bases are positively oriented.
34.6. THE HODGE ∗-OPERATOR 1215
Definition 34.7. The operator ∗ from V k
V to V n−k
V defined by Proposition 34.15 is
called the Hodge ∗-operator .
Obseve that the Hodge ∗-operator is linear.
The Hodge ∗-operator is defined in terms of the orthonormal basis elements of V V as
follows: For any increasing sequence (i1, . . . , ik) of elements ip ∈ {1, . . . , n}, if (j1, . . . , jn−k)
is the increasing sequence of elements jq ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that
{i1, . . . , ik} ∪ {j1, . . . , jn−k} = {1, . . . , n},
then
∗(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
) = sign(i1, . . . ik, j1, . . . , jn−k) ej1 ∧ · · · ∧ ejn−k
.
In particular, for k = 0 and k = n, we have
∗(1) = e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en
∗(e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en) = 1.
For example, if n = 3, we have
∗e1 = e2 ∧ e3
∗e2 = −e1 ∧ e3
∗e3 = e1 ∧ e2
∗(e1 ∧ e2) = e3
∗(e1 ∧ e3) = −e2
∗(e2 ∧ e3) = e1.
The Hodge ∗-operators ∗:
V
k
V →
V n−k
V induce a linear map ∗:
V (V ) →
V (V ). We
also have Hodge ∗-operators ∗:
V
k
V
∗ →
V n−k
V
∗
.
The following proposition shows that the linear map ∗:
V (V ) →
V (V ) is an isomorphism.
Proposition 34.16. If V is any oriented vector space of dimension n, for every k with
0 ≤ k ≤ n, we have
(i) ∗∗ = (−id)k(n−k)
.
(ii) h x, yi ∧ = ∗(x ∧ ∗y) = ∗(y ∧ ∗x), for all x, y ∈
V
k
V .
Proof. (1) Let (ei)
n
i=1 is an orthonormal basis of V . It is enough to check the identity on
basis elements. We have
∗(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
) = sign(i1, . . . ik, j1, . . . , jn−k) ej1 ∧ · · · ∧ ejn−k
1216 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
and
∗∗(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
) = sign(i1, . . . ik, j1, . . . , jn−k) ∗(ej1 ∧ · · · ∧ ejn−k
)
= sign(i1, . . . ik, j1, . . . , jn−k) sign(j1, . . . , jn−k, i1, . . . ik) ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
.
It is easy to see that
sign(i1, . . . ik, j1, . . . , jn−k) sign(j1, . . . , jn−k, i1, . . . ik) = (−1)k(n−k)
,
which yields
∗∗(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
) = (−1)k(n−k)
ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
,
as claimed.
(ii) These identities are easily checked on basis elements; see Jost [101], Chapter 2, Lemma
2.1.1. In particular let
x = ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
, y = eij ∧ · · · ∧ eij
, x, y ∈
k
^
V,
where (ei)
n
i=1 is an orthonormal basis of V . If x 6 = y, h x, yi ∧ = 0 since there is some eip of
x not equal to any ejq of y by the orthonormality of the basis, this means the p
th row of
(h eil
, ejs
i
) consists entirely of zeroes. Also x 6 = y implies that y ∧ ∗x = 0 since
∗x = sign(i1, . . . ik, l1, . . . , ln−k)el1 ∧ · · · ∧ eln−k
,
where els
is the same as some ep in y. A similar argument shows that if x 6 = y, x ∧ ∗y = 0.
So now assume x = y. Then
∗(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik ∧ ∗(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
)) = ∗(e1 ∧ e2 · · · ∧ en)
= 1 = h x, xi ∧.
It is possible to express ∗(1) in terms of any basis (not necessarily orthonormal) of V .
Proposition 34.17. If V is any finite-dimensional oriented vector space, for any basis
(v!
, . . . , vn) of V , we have
∗(1) = 1
p
det(h vi
, vj i )
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn.
Proof. If (e1, . . . , en) is an orthonormal basis of V and (v1, . . . , vn) is any other basis of V ,
then
h
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn, v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vni ∧ = det(h vi
, vj i ),
and since
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn = det(A) e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en
34.7. LEFT AND RIGHT HOOKS ~ 1217
where A is the matrix expressing the vj
in terms of the ei
, we have
h
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn, v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vni ∧ = det(A)
2
h
e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en, e1 ∧ · · · ∧ eni = det(A)
2
.
As a consequence, det(A) = p det(h vi
, vj i ), and
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn =
q det(h vi
, vj i ) e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en,
from which it follows that
∗(1) = 1
p
det(h vi
, vj i )
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn
(see Jost [101], Chapter 2, Lemma 2.1.3).

as well as the versions obtained by replacing E by E
∗ and E
∗∗ by E. We begin with the left
interior product or left hook, y .
Let u ∈
V

map
∧R(u):

◦ ∧R(u),
where z
∗ ∈
V
p+q E
∗
. We denote z
∗ ◦ ∧R(u) by u y z
∗
. In terms of our pairing, the adjoint
u y of ∧R(u) defined by
h
u y z
∗
, vi = h z
∗
, ∧R(u)(v)i ;
this in turn leads to the following definition.
Definition 34.8. Let u ∈
V
p E and z
∗ ∈
V
p+q E
∗
. We define u y z
∗ ∈
V
q E
∗
to be q-vector
uniquely determined by
h
u y z
∗
, vi = h z
∗
, v ∧ ui , for all v ∈
V
q E.
Remark: Note that to be precise the operator
y
:
p
^
E ×
p+q
^
E
∗ −→
q
^
E
∗
depends of p, q, so we really defined a family of operators y p,q. This family of operators y p,q
induces a map
y

with

p,q :
p

as defined before. The common practice is to omit the subscripts of y .
It is immediately verified that
(u ∧ v) y z
∗ = u y (v y z
∗
),
for all u ∈
V
k E, v ∈
V
p−k E, z

since
h

, w ∧ ui = h u y (v y z

34.7. LEFT AND RIGHT HOOKS ~ 1219
whenever w ∈
V
q E. This means that
y
:
^ E ×

∗
is a left action of the (noncommutative) ring V E with multiplication ∧ on V E
∗
, which
makes V E
∗
into a left V E-module.
By interchanging E and E
∗ and using the isomorphism

^
k
F

∗
∼=

,
we can also define some maps
y
:
p
^

and make the following definition.
Definition 34.9. Let u
∗ ∈
V
p E
∗
, and z ∈
V
p+q E. We define u
∗ y
z ∈
V
q
as the q-vector
uniquely defined by
h
v
∗ ∧ u
∗
, zi = h v
∗
, u∗
y
zi , for all v
∗ ∈
V
q E
∗
.
As for the previous version, we have a family of operators y p,q which define an operator
y
:
^ E
∗ ×
^ E −→ ^ E.
We easily verify that
(u
∗ ∧ v
∗
) y z = u
∗
y
(v

y
z),
whenever u
∗ ∈
V
k E
∗
, v
∗ ∈
V
p−k E
∗
, and z ∈
V
p+q E; so this version of y is a left action of
the ring V E
∗ on V E which makes V E into a left V E
∗
-module.
In order to proceed any further we need some combinatorial properties of the basis of
V
p E constructed from a basis (e1, . . . , en) of E. Recall that for any (nonempty) subset
I ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, we let
eI = ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eip
,
where I = {i1, . . . , ip} with i1 < · · · < ip. We also let e∅ = 1.
Given any two nonempty subsets H, L ⊆ {1, . . . , n} both listed in increasing order, say
H = {h1 < . . . < hp} and L = {` 1 < . . . < `q}, if H and L are disjoint, let H ∪ L be union
of H and L considered as the ordered sequence
(h1, . . . , hp, `1, . . . , `q).
Then let

where
ν = |{(h, l) | (h, l) ∈ H × L, h > l}|.
Observe that when H ∩L = ∅, |H| = p and |L| = q, the number ν is the number of inversions
of the sequence
(h1, · · · , hp, `1, · · · , `q),
where an inversion is a pair (hi
, `j ) such that hi > `j
.

Unless p + q = n, the function whose graph is given by

1 · · · p p + 1 · · · p + q
h1 · · · hp ` 1 · · · ` q

is not a permutation of {1, . . . , n}. We can view ν as a slight generalization of the notion
of the number of inversions of a permutation.
Proposition 34.18. For any basis (e1, . . . , en) of E the following properties hold:
(1) If H ∩ L = ∅, |H| = p, and |L| = q, then
ρH,LρL,H = (−1)ν
(−1)pq−ν = (−1)pq
.
(2) For H, L ⊆ {1, . . . , m} listed in increasing order, we have
eH ∧ eL = ρH,LeH∪L.
Similarly,

34.7. LEFT AND RIGHT HOOKS ~ 1221
Proof. These are proved in Bourbaki [25] (Chapter III, §11, Section 11), but the proofs of
(3) and (4) are very concise. We elaborate on the proofs of (2) and (4), the proof of (3)
being similar.
In (2) if H∩L 6 = ∅, then eH ∧eL contains some vector twice and so eH ∧eL = 0. Otherwise,
eH ∧ eL consists of
eh1 ∧ · · · ∧ ehp ∧ e` 1 ∧ · · · ∧ e` q
,
and to order the sequence of indices in increasing order we need to transpose any two indices
(hi
, `j ) corresponding to an inversion, which yields ρH,LeH∪L.
Let us now consider (4). We have |L| = p + q and |H| = p, and the q-vector e
∗
H y eL is
characterized by
h
v
∗
, e∗
H y eLi = h v
∗ ∧ e
∗
H, eLi
for all v
∗ ∈
V
q E
∗
. There are two cases.
Case 1: H 6⊆ L. If so, no matter what v
∗ ∈
V
q E
∗
is, since H contains some index h
not in L, the hth row (e
∗
h
(e` 1
), . . . , e∗
h
(e` p+q
)) of the determinant h v
∗ ∧ e
∗
H, eLi must be zero,
so h v
∗ ∧ e
∗
H, eLi = 0 for all v
∗ ∈
V
q E
∗
, and since the pairing is nongenerate, we must have
e
∗
H y eL = 0.
Case 2: H ⊆ L. In this case, for v
∗ = e
∗
L−H, by (2) we have
h
e
∗
L−H, e∗
H y eLi = h e
∗
L−H ∧ e
∗
H, eLi = h ρL−H,He
∗
L
, eLi = ρL−H,H,
which yields
h
e
∗
L−H, e∗
H y eLi = ρL−H,H.
The q-vector e
∗
H y eL can be written as a linear combination e
∗
H y eL =
P J
λJ eJ with |J| = q
so
h
e
∗
L−H, e∗
H y eLi =
X
J
λJ h e
∗
L−H, eJ i .
By definition of the pairing, h e
∗
L−H, eJ i = 0 unless J = L − H, which means that
h
e
∗
L−H, e∗
H y eLi = λL−Hh e
∗
L−H, eL−Hi = λL−H,
so λL−H = ρL−H,H, as claimed.
Using Proposition 34.18, we have the
Proposition 34.19. For the left hook

Proof. We can prove the above identity assuming that x
∗ and y
∗ are of the form e
∗
I
and e
∗
J
using Proposition 34.18 and leave the details as an exercise for the reader.
Thus, y : E ×
V
q+1 E
∗ −→ V q E
∗
is almost an anti-derivation, except that the sign (−1)s
is applied to the wrong factor.
We have a similar identity for the other version of the left hook
y
: E
∗ ×
q+1
^
E −→
q
^
E,
namely
u
∗
y
(x ∧ y) = (−1)s
(u
∗
y x) ∧ y + x ∧ (u
∗
y
y)
for every u
∗ ∈ E
∗
, x ∈
V
q+1−s E, and y ∈
V
s E.
An application of this formula when q = 3 and s = 2 yields an interesting equation. In
this case, u
∗ ∈ E
∗ and x, y ∈
V
2 E, so we get
u
∗
y
(x ∧ y) = (u
∗
y x) ∧ y + x ∧ (u
∗
y
y).
In particular, for x = y, since x ∈
V
2 E and u
∗ y x ∈ E, Proposition 34.12 implies that
(u
∗ y x) ∧ x = x ∧ (u
∗ y x), and we obtain
u
∗
y
(x ∧ x) = 2((u
∗
y x) ∧ x). (†)
As a consequence, (u
∗ y x) ∧ x = 0 iff u
∗ y
(x ∧ x) = 0. We will use this identity together
with Proposition 34.25 to prove that a 2-vector x ∈
V
2 E is decomposable iff x ∧ x = 0.
It is also possible to define a right interior product or right hook x , using multiplication
on the left rather than multiplication on the right. Then we use the maps
x
:
p+q
^
E
∗ ×
p
^
E −→
q
^
E
∗
to make the following definition.
Definition 34.10. Let u ∈
V
p E and z
∗ ∈
V
p+q E
∗
. We define z
∗ x u ∈
V
q E
∗
to be the
q-vector uniquely defined as
h
z
∗
x u, vi = h z
∗
, u ∧ vi , for all v ∈
V
q E.
This time we can prove that
