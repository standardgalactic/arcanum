, and P(E) can be identified with
the set of lines in RP2
. But when m ≥ 3, things are even worse regarding the injectivity of
the map [P] 7→ V (P). For instance, both P = xy2 and Q = x
2
y define the same union of two
lines. It is necessary to consider irreducible curves, i.e., curves that are defined by irreducible
polynomials, and to work over the field C of complex numbers (recall that a polynomial P
is irreducible if it cannot be written as the product P = Q1Q2 of two polynomials Q1, Q2
of degree ≥ 1). We refer the reader to Fischer’s book for a beautiful (and very clear)
introduction to algebraic curves [62]. The next step is Fulton [66].
We can also investigate algebraic surfaces in RP3
(or CP3
), by letting E be the vector
space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m in four variables x, y, z, t (plus the null
polynomial). We can also consider the zero locus of a set of equations
E = {P1 = 0, P2 = 0, . . . , Pn = 0},
where P1, . . . , Pn are homogeneous polynomials of degree m in x, y, z, t, defined as
V (E) = {(x: y : z : t) ∈ RP3
| Pi(x, y, z, t) = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
This way, we can also deal with space curves.
Finally, we can consider homogeneous polynomials P(x1, . . . , xN+1) in N + 1 variables
and of degree m (plus the null polynomial), and study the subsets of RPN
or CPN
(or more
generally of P
N
K, for an arbitrary field K), defined as the zero locus of a set of equations
E = {P1 = 0, P2 = 0, . . . , Pn = 0},
where P1, . . . , Pn are homogeneous polynomials of degree m in the variables x1, . . ., xN+1.
For example, it turns out that the set of lines in RP3
forms a surface of degree 2 in RP5
(the
Klein quadric). However, all this would really take us too far into algebraic geometry, and
we simply refer the interested reader to Hulek [97], Fulton [66], and Harris [87].
We now consider projective maps.

26.5 Projective Maps
Given two nontrivial vector spaces E and F and a linear map f : E → F, observe that for
every u, v ∈ (E − Ker f), if v = λu for some λ ∈ K − {0}, then f(v) = λf(u), and thus f
restricted to (E − Ker f) induces a function P(f): (P(E) − P(Ker f)) → P(F) defined such
that
P(f)([u]∼) = [f(u)]∼,
as in the following commutative diagram:

When f is injective, i.e., when Ker f = {0}, then P(f): P(E) → P(F) is indeed a well￾defined function. The above discussion motivates the following definition.
Definition 26.5. Given two nontrivial vector spaces E and F, any linear map f : E → F
induces a partial map P(f): P(E) → P(F) called a projective map, such that if Ker f =
defined such that
{u ∈ E | f(u) = 0} is the kernel of f, then P(f): (P(E)−P(Ker f)) → P(F) is a total map
P(f)([u]∼) = [f(u)]∼,

If f is injective, i.e., when Ker f = {0}, then P(f): P(E) → P(F) is a total function called
a projective transformation, and when f is bijective, we call P(f) a projectivity, or projective
isomorphism, or homography. The set of projectivities P(f): P(E) → P(E) is a group
called the projective (linear) group, and is denoted by PGL(E).

One should realize that if a linear map f : E → F is not injective, then the projective
map P(f): P(E) → P(F) is only a partial map, i.e., it is undefined on P(Ker f). In
particular, if f : E → F is the null map (i.e., Ker f = E), the domain of P(f) is empty and
P(f) is the partial function undefined everywhere. We might want to require in Definition
26.5 that f not be the null map to avoid this degenerate case. Projective maps are often
defined only when they are induced by bijective linear maps.
26.5. PROJECTIVE MAPS 883
We take a closer look at the projectivities of the projective line P
1
K, since they play a role
in the “change of parameters” for projective curves. A projectivity f : P
1
K → P
1
K is induced
by some bijective linear map g : K2 → K2 given by some invertible matrix
M(g) =  a b
c d
with ad − bc 6 = 0. Since the projective line P
1
K is isomorphic to K ∪ {∞}, it is easily verified
that f is defined as follows:
c 6 = 0

From Section 26.4, we know that the points not at infinity are repesented by vectors of
the form (z, 1) where z ∈ K and that ∞ is represented by (1, 0). First, assume c 6 = 0. Since

(az + b, cz + d) ∼

so z is is mapped to (az + d)/cz + d). If cz + d = 0, then
(az + d, 0) ∼ (1, 0) = ∞,
so −d/c is mapped to ∞. We also have


and since c 6 = 0 we have
(a, c) ∼ (a/c, 1),
so ∞ is mapped to a/c. The case where c = 0 is handled similarly.
If K = R or K = C, note that a/c is the limit of (az + b)/(cz + d), as z approaches
infinity, and the limit of (az + b)/(cz + d) as z approaches −d/c is ∞ (when c 6 = 0).
Projections between hyperplanes form an important example of projectivities.
884 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
Definition 26.6. Given a projective space P(E), for any two distinct hyperplanes P(H) and
P(H0 ), for any point c ∈ P(E) neither in P(H) nor in P(H0 ), the projection (or perspectivity)
of center c between P(H) and P(H0 ) is the map f : P(H) → P(H0 ) defined such that for
every a ∈ P(H), the point f(a) is the intersection of the line h c, ai through c and a with
P(H0 ).
Let us verify that f is well–defined and a bijective projective transformation. Since the
hyperplanes P(H) and P(H0 ) are distinct, the hyperplanes H and H0 in E are distinct, and
since c is neither in P(H) nor in P(H0 ), letting c = p(u) for some nonnull vector u ∈ E,
then u /∈ H and u /∈ H0 , and thus E = H ⊕ Ku = H0 ⊕ Ku. If π : E → H0 is the linear map
(projection onto H0 parallel to u) defined such that
π(w + λu) = w,
for all w ∈ H0 and all λ ∈ K, since E = H ⊕ Ku = H0 ⊕ Ku, the restriction g : H → H0 of
π : E → H0 to H is a linear bijection between H and H0 , and clearly f = P(g), which shows
that f is a projectivity.
Remark: Going back to the linear map π : E → H0 (projection onto H0 parallel to u), note
that P(π): P(E) → P(H0 ) is also a projective map, but it is not injective, and thus only a
partial map. More generally, given a direct sum E = V ⊕ W, the projection π : E → V onto
V parallel to W induces a projective map P(π): P(E) → P(V ), and given another direct
sum E = U ⊕ W, the restriction of π to U induces a perspectivity f between P(U) and
P(V ). Geometrically, f is defined as follows: Given any point a ∈ P(U), if h P(W), ai is the
smallest projective subspace containing P(W) and a, the point f(a) is the intersection of
h
P(W), ai with P(V ).
Figure 26.11 illustrates a projection f of center c between two projective lines ∆ and ∆0
(in the real projective plane).
If we consider three distinct points d1, d2, d3 on ∆ and their images d
01

the projection f, then ratios are not preserved, that is,

We now turn to the issue of determining when two linear maps f, g determine the same
projective map, i.e., when P(f) = P(g). The following proposition gives us a complete
answer.
Proposition 26.4. Given two nontrivial vector spaces E and F, for any two linear maps
f : E → F and g : E → F, we have P(f) = P(g) iff there is some scalar λ ∈ K − {0} such
that g = λf.
Proof. If g = λf, it is clear that P(f) = P(g). Conversely, in order to have P(f) = P(g),
we must have Ker f = Ker g. If Ker f = Ker g = E, then f and g are both the null map, and
this case is trivial. If E −Ker f 6 = ∅, by taking a basis of Im f and some inverse image of this
basis, we obtain a basis B of a subspace G of E such that E = Ker f ⊕G. If dim(G) = 1, the
restriction of any linear map f : E → F to G is determined by some nonzero vector u ∈ E
and some scalar λ ∈ K, and the proposition is obvious. Thus, assume that dim(G) ≥ 2.
For any two distinct basis vectors u, v ∈ B, since P(f) = P(g), there must be some nonzero
scalars λ(u), λ(v), and λ(u + v) such that
g(u) = λ(u)f(u), g(v) = λ(v)f(v), g(u + v) = λ(u + v)f(u + v).
Since f and g are linear, we get
g(u) + g(v) = λ(u)f(u) + λ(v)f(v) = λ(u + v)(f(u) + f(v)),
that is,
(λ(u + v) − λ(u))f(u) + (λ(u + v) − λ(v))f(v) = 0.
Since f is injective on G and u, v ∈ B ⊆ G are linearly independent, f(u) and f(v) are also
linearly independent, and thus we have
λ(u + v) = λ(u) = λ(v).
886 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
Now we have shown that λ(u) = λ(v), for any two distinct basis vectors in B, which proves
that λ(u) is independent of u ∈ G, and proves that g = λf.
Proposition 26.4 shows that the projective linear group PGL(E) is isomorphic to the
quotient group of the linear group GL(E) modulo the subgroup K∗
idE (where K∗ = K −
{0}). Using projective frames, we prove the following useful result.
Proposition 26.5. Given two nontrivial vector spaces E and F of the same dimension
n + 1, for any two projective frames (ai)1≤i≤n+2 for P(E) and (bi)1≤i≤n+2 for P(F), there is
a unique projectivity h: P(E) → P(F) such that h(ai) = bi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2.
Proof. Let (u1, . . . , un+1) be a basis of E associated with the projective frame (ai)1≤i≤n+2,
and let (v1, . . . , vn+1) be a basis of F associated with the projective frame (bi)1≤i≤n+2. Since
(u1, . . . , un+1) is a basis, there is a unique linear bijection g : E → F such that g(ui) = vi
,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1. Clearly, h = P(g) is a projectivity such that h(ai) = bi
, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2.
Let h
0 : P(E) → P(F) be any projectivity such that h
0 (ai) = bi
, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2. By
definition, there is a linear isomorphism f : E → F such that h
0 = P(f). Since h
0 (ai) = bi
,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2, we must have f(ui) = λivi
, for some λi ∈ K − {0}, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1,
and
f(u1 + · · · + un+1) = λ(v1 + · · · + vn+1),
for some λ ∈ K − {0}. By linearity of f, we have
λ1v1 + · · · + λn+1vn+1 = λv1 + · · · + λvn+1,
and since (v1, . . . , vn+1) is a basis of F, we must have
λ1 = · · · = λn+1 = λ.
This shows that f = λg, and thus that
h
0 = P(f) = P(g) = h,
and h is uniquely determined.

The above proposition and Proposition 26.4 are false if K is a skew field. Also,
Proposition 26.5 fails if (bi)1≤i≤n+2 is not a projective frame, or if an+2 is dropped.
As a corollary of Proposition 26.5, given a projective space P(E), two distinct projective
lines D and D0 in P(E), three distinct points a, b, c on D, and any three distinct points
a
0 , b0 , c0 on D0 , there is a unique projectivity from D to D0 , mapping a to a
0 , b to b
0 , and c
to c
0 . This is because, as we mentioned earlier, any three distinct points on a line form a
projective frame.
Remark: As in the affine case, there is “fundamental theorem of projective geometry.” For
simplicity, we state this theorem assuming that vector spaces are over the field K = R. Given
26.5. PROJECTIVE MAPS 887
any two projective spaces P(E) and P(F) of the same dimension n ≥ 2, for any bijective
function f : P(E) → P(F), if f maps any three distinct collinear points a, b, c to collinear
points f(a), f(b), f(c), then f is a projectivity. For more general fields, f = P(g) for some
“semilinear” bijection g : E → F. A map such as f (preserving collinearity of any three
distinct points) is often called a collineation. For K = R, collineations and projectivities
coincide. For more details, see Samuel [142].
Before closing this section, we illustrate the power of Proposition 26.5 by proving two
interesting results. We begin by characterizing perspectivities between lines.
Proposition 26.6. Given any two distinct lines D and D0 in the real projective plane RP2
,
a projectivity f : D → D0 is a perspectivity iff f(O) = O, where O is the intersection of D
and D0 .
Proof. If f : D → D0 is a perspectivity, then by the very definition of f, we have f(O) = O.
Conversely, let f : D → D0 be a projectivity such that f(O) = O. Let a, b be any two distinct
points on D also distinct from O, and let a
0 = f(a) and b
0 = f(b) on D0 . Since f is a bijection
and since a, b, O are pairwise distinct, a
0 6 = b
0 . Let c be the intersection of the lines h a, a0 i
and h b, b0 i , which by the assumptions on a, b, O, cannot be on D or D0 . Then we can define
the perspectivity g : D → D0 of center c, and by the definition of c, we have
g(a) = a
0 , g(b) = b
0 , g(O) = O.
See Figure 26.12. However, f agrees with g on O, a, b, and since (O, a, b) is a projective
frame for D, by Proposition 26.5, we must have f = g.
Using Proposition 26.6, we can give an elegant proof of a version of Desargues’s theorem
(in the plane).
Proposition 26.7. (Desargues) Given two triangles (a, b, c) and (a
0 , b0 , c0 ) in RP2
, where the
points a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c
0 are pairwise distinct and the lines A = h b, ci , B = h a, ci , C = h a, bi ,
A0 = h b
0 , c0 i , B0 = h a
0 , c0 i , C
0 = h a
0 , b0 i are pairwise distinct, if the lines h a, a0 i , h b, b0 i , and
h
c, c0 i intersect in a common point d distinct from a, b, c, a
0 , b0 , c0 , then the intersection points
p = h b, ci∩ hb
0 , c0 i , q = h a, ci∩ ha
0 , c0 i , and r = h a, bi∩ ha
0 , b0 i belong to a common line distinct
from A, B, C, A0 , B0 , C0 .
Proof. In view of the assumptions on a, b, c, a
0 , b0 , c0 , and d, the point r is on neither h a, a0 i
nor h b, b0 i , the point p is on neither h b, b0 i nor h c, c0 i , and the point q is on neither h a, a0 i nor
h
c, c0 i . It is also immediately shown that the line h p, qi is distinct from the lines A, B, C,
A0 , B0 , C0 . Let f : h a, a0 i → hb, b0 i be the perspectivity of center r and g : h b, b0 i → hc, c0 i be
the perspectivity of center p. Let h = g ◦ f. Since both f(d) = d and g(d) = d, we also have

h(d) = d. Thus by Proposition 26.6, the projectivity h: h a, a0 i → hc, c0 i is a perspectivity.
Since
h(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c,
h(a
0 ) = g(f(a
0 )) = g(b
0 ) = c
0 ,
the intersection q of h a, ci and h a
0 , c0 i is the center of the perspectivity h. Also note that the
point m = h a, a0 i ∩ hp, ri and its image h(m) are both on the line h p, ri , since r is the center
of f and p is the center of g. Since h is a perspectivity of center q, the line h m, h(m)i = h p, ri
passes through q, which proves the proposition.
Desargues’s theorem is illustrated in Figure 26.13. It can also be shown that every
projectivity between two distinct lines is the composition of two perspectivities (not in a
unique way). An elegant proof of Pappus’s theorem can also be given using perspectivities.
26.6 Finding a Homography Between Two Projective
Frames
In this section we present a method for finding the matrix (up to a scalar) of the unique
homography (bijective projective transformation) mapping one projective frame to an other
projective frame. This problem arises notably in computer vision in the context of image
morphing.
We begin with the simple case of two nondegenerate quadrilatrerals ([p1], [p2], [p3], [p4])
and [(q1], [q2], [q3], [q4]) in RP2
, that is, two projective frames, which means that (p1, p2, p3)

and (q1, q2, q3) are linearly independent, and that if we write

and
q4 = λ1q1 + λ2q2 + λ3q3,
for some unique scalars α1, α2, α3 and λ1, λ2, λ3, then αi 6 = 0 and λi 6 = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. The
problem is to find the 3 × 3 matrix (up to a scalar) representing the unique homography h
mapping [pi
] to [qi
] for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
We will use the canonical basis E = (e1, e2, e3) of R
3
, with e1 = (1, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0),
e3 = (0, 0, 1), and the bases P = (p1, p2, p3) and Q = (q1, q2, q3) of R
3
.
As a first step, it is convenient to express (q1, q2, q3, q4) over the basis P = (p1, p2, p3), with
q1 = (x1, y1, z1), q2 = (x2, y2, z2), q3 = (x3, y3, z3), q4 = (x4, y4, z4). Over the canonical basis

Proposition 26.8. With respect to the basis P = (p1, p2, p3), the matrix AP of the unique
homography h of RP2 mapping the projective frame ([p1], [p2], [p3], [p4]) to the projective frame
[(q1], [q2], [q3], [q4]) is given by
AP =

Proof. Let u1 = α1p1, u2 = α2p2, u3 = α3p3, and let v1 = λ1q1, v2 = λ2q2, v3 = λ3q3, so that
p4 = u1 + u2 + u3
and
q4 = v1 + v2 + v3.
Because p1, p2, p3 are linearly independent and since αi 6 = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, the vectors
(u1, u2, u2) are also linearly independent, so there is a unique linear map f : R
3 → R
3
, such
that
f(ui) = vi i = 1, . . . , 3,
and by linearity
f(p4) = f(u1 + u2 + u3) = f(u1) + f(u2) + f(u3) = v1 + v2 + v3 = q4.

If we assume that we pick the coordinates of (p1, p2, p3, p4) and (q1, q2, q3, q4) with respect
to the canonical basis E, then the coordinates α1, α2, α3 and λ1, λ2, λ3 are solutions of the

follows.
Proposition 26.9. With respect to the canonical basis E = (e1, e2, e3), the matrix AE of
the unique homography h of RP2 mapping the projective frame ([p1], [p2], [p3], [p4]) to the
projective frame [(q1], [q2], [q3], [q4]) is given by

Proof. Since f : R
3 → R
3
is the unique linear map given by
f(ui) = vi
, i = 1, . . . , 3,
the map f : R
3 → R
3
is equal to the composition
f = fQ ◦ g,
where g : R
3 → R
3
is the unique linear map given by
g(ui) = ei
, i = 1, . . . , 3,
and fQ : R
3 → R
3
is the unique linear map given by
fQ(ei) = vi
, i = 1, . . . , 3.
However, g : R
3 → R
3
is the inverse of the unique linear map fP : R
3 → R
3 given by
fP(ei) = ui
, i = 1, . . . , 3,
so
f = fQ ◦ fP
