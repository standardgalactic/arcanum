where the pi ∈ K[X] are distinct irreducible monic polynomials, the ki are (not necessarily

Proof. First, we prove the existence of such a factorization by induction on d = deg(f).
Clearly, it is enough to prove the result for monic polynomials f of degree d = deg(f) ≥ 1.
If d = 1, then f = X + a0, which is an irreducible monic polynomial.
Assume d ≥ 2, and assume the induction hypothesis for all monic polynomials of degree
< d. Consider the set S of all monic polynomials g such that deg(g) ≥ 1 and g divides
f. Since f ∈ S, the set S is nonempty, and thus, S contains some monic polynomial p1 of
minimal degree. Since deg(p1) ≥ 1, the monic polynomial p1 must be irreducible. Otherwise
we would have p1 = g1g2, for some monic polynomials g1, g2 such that deg(p1) > deg(g1) ≥ 1
and deg(p1) > deg(g2) ≥ 1, and since p1 divide f, then g1 would divide f, contradicting
the minimality of the degree of p1. Thus, we have f = p1q, for some irreducible monic
polynomial p1, with q also monic. Since deg(p1) ≥ 1, we have deg(q) < deg(f), and we can
apply the induction hypothesis to q. Thus, we obtain a factorization of the desired form.

We prove that m = n, pi = qi and hi = ki

The proof proceeds by induction on h1 + · · · + hn.

and we can apply the induction hypothesis to conclude that m = n, pi = qi and hi = ki
,
with 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
The above considerations about unique factorization into irreducible factors can be ex￾tended almost without changes to more general rings known as Euclidean domains. In such
rings, some abstract version of the division theorem is assumed to hold.
Definition 30.10. A Euclidean domain (or Euclidean ring) is an integral domain A such
that there exists a function ϕ: A → N with the following property: For all a, b ∈ A with
b 6 = 0, there are some q, r ∈ A such that
a = bq + r and ϕ(r) < ϕ(b).
30.5. FACTORIZATION AND IRREDUCIBLE FACTORS IN K[X] 1071
Note that the pair (q, r) is not necessarily unique.
Actually, unique factorization holds in principal ideal domains (PID’s), see Theorem
32.12. As shown below, every Euclidean domain is a PID, and thus, unique factorization
holds for Euclidean domains.
Proposition 30.18. Every Euclidean domain A is a PID.
Proof. Let I be a nonnull ideal in A. Then, the set
{ϕ(a) | a ∈ I}
is nonempty, and thus, has a smallest element m. Let b be any (nonnull) element of I such
that m = ϕ(b). We claim that I = (b). Given any a ∈ I, we can write
a = bq + r
for some q, r ∈ A, with ϕ(r) < ϕ(b). Since b ∈ I and I is an ideal, we also have bq ∈ I,
and since a, bq ∈ I and I is an ideal, then r ∈ I with ϕ(r) < ϕ(b) = m, contradicting the
minimality of m. Thus, r = 0 and a ∈ (b). But then,
I ⊆ (b),
and since b ∈ I, we get
I = (b),
and A is a PID.
As a corollary of Proposition 30.18, the ring Z is a Euclidean domain (using the function
ϕ(a) = |a|) and thus, a PID. If K is a field, the function ϕ on K[X] defined such that
ϕ(f) =  0 if
deg(f) + 1 if f
f
6
= 0,
= 0,
shows that K[X] is a Euclidean domain.
Example 30.3. A more interesting example of a Euclidean domain is the ring Z[i] of Gaus￾sian integers, i.e., the subring of C consisting of all complex numbers of the form a + ib,
where a, b ∈ Z. Using the function ϕ defined such that
ϕ(a + ib) = a
2 + b
2
,
we leave it as an interesting exercise to prove that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain.

Not every PID is a Euclidean ring.
1072 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
Remark: Given any integer d ∈ Z such that d 6 = 0, 1 and d does not have any square factor
greater than one, the quadratic field Q(
√
d) is the field consisting of all complex numbers
of the form a + ib√
−d if d < 0, and of all the real numbers of the form a + b
√
d if d > 0,
with a, b ∈ Q. The subring of Q(
√
d) consisting of all elements as above for which a, b ∈ Z
is denoted by Z[
√
d]. We define the ring of integers of the field Q(
√
d) as the subring of
Q(
√
d) consisting of the following elements:
(1) If d ≡ 2 (mod 4) or d ≡ 3 (mod 4), then all elements of the form a + ib√
−d (if d < 0)
or all elements of the form a + b
√
d (if d > 0), with a, b ∈ Z;
(2) If d ≡ 1 (mod 4), then all elements of the form (a + ib√
−d)/2 (if d < 0) or all elements
of the form (a+b
√
d)/2 (if d > 0), with a, b ∈ Z and with a, b either both even or both
odd.
Observe that when d ≡ 2 (mod 4) or d ≡ 3 (mod 4), the ring of integers of Q(
√
d) is equal to
Z[
√
d].
It can be shown that the rings of integers of the fields Q(
√
−d) where d = 19, 43, 67, 163
are PID’s, but not Euclidean rings. The proof is hard and long. First, it can be shown that
these rings are UFD’s (refer to Definition 32.2), see Stark [164] (Chapter 8, Theorems 8.21
and 8.22). Then, we use the fact that the ring of integers of the field Q(
√
d) (with d 6 = 0, 1
any square-free integers) is a certain kind of integral domain called a Dedekind ring; see
Atiyah-MacDonald [8] (Chapter 9, Theorem 9.5) or Samuel [143] (Chapter III, Section 3.4).
Finally, we use the fact that if a Dedekind ring is a UFD then it is a PID, which follows
from Proposition 32.13.
Actually, the rings of integers of Q(
√
d) that are Euclidean domains are completely deter￾mined but the proof is quite difficult. It turns out that there are twenty one such rings corre￾sponding to the integers: −11, −7, −3, −2, −1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57
and 73, see Stark [164] (Chapter 8). For more on quadratic fields and their rings of integers,
see Stark [164] (Chapter 8) or Niven, Zuckerman and Montgomery [132] (Chapter 9).
It is possible to characterize a larger class of rings (in terms of ideals), factorial rings (or
unique factorization domains), for which unique factorization holds (see Section 32.1). We
now consider zeros (or roots) of polynomials.
30.6 Roots of Polynomials
We go back to the general case of an arbitrary ring for a little while.
Definition 30.11. Given a ring A and any polynomial f ∈ A[X], we say that some α ∈ A
is a zero of f, or a root of f, if f(α) = 0. Similarly, given a polynomial f ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn],
we say that (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ An
is a a zero of f, or a root of f, if f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0.
When f ∈ A[X] is the null polynomial, every α ∈ A is trivially a zero of f. This case
being trivial, we usually assume that we are considering zeros of nonnull polynomials.
30.6. ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS 1073
Example 30.4. Considering the polynomial f(X) = X2 − 1, both +1 and −1 are zeros of
f(X). Over the field of reals, the polynomial g(X) = X2 + 1 has no zeros. Over the field C
of complex numbers, g(X) = X2 + 1 has two roots i and −i, the square roots of −1, which
are “imaginary numbers.”
We have the following basic proposition showing the relationship between polynomial
division and roots.
Proposition 30.19. Let f ∈ A[X] be any polynomial and α ∈ A any element of A. If the
result of dividing f by X − α is f = (X − α)q + r, then r = 0 iff f(α) = 0, i.e., α is a root
of f iff r = 0.
Proof. We have f = (X − α)q + r, with deg(r) < 1 = deg(X − α). Thus, r is a constant in
K, and since f(α) = (α − α)q(α) + r, we get f(α) = r, and the proposition is trivial.
We now consider the issue of multiplicity of a root.
Proposition 30.20. Let f ∈ A[X] be any nonnull polynomial and h ≥ 0 any integer. The
following conditions are equivalent.
(1) f is divisible by (X − α)
h
but not by (X − α)
h+1
.
(2) There is some g ∈ A[X] such that f = (X − α)
h
g and g(α) 6 = 0.
Proof. Assume (1). Then, we have f = (X − α)
h
g for some g ∈ A[X]. If we had g(α) = 0,
by Proposition 30.19, g would be divisible by (X − α), and then f would be divisible by
(X − α)
h+1, contradicting (1).
Assume (2), that is, f = (X − α)
h
g and g(α) 6 = 0. If f is divisible by (X − α)
h+1, then
we have f = (X − α)
h+1g1, for some g1 ∈ A[X]. Then, we have
(X − α)
h
g = (X − α)
h+1g1,
and thus
(X − α)
h
(g − (X − α)g1) = 0,
and since the leading coefficient of (X − α)
h
is 1 (show this by induction), by Proposition
30.1, (X − α)
h
is not a zero divisor, and we get g − (X − α)g1 = 0, i.e., g = (X − α)g1, and
so g(α) = 0, contrary to the hypothesis.
As a consequence of Proposition 30.20, for every nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X] and every
α ∈ A, there is a unique integer h ≥ 0 such that f is divisible by (X − α)
h but not by
(X − α)
h+1. Indeed, since f is divisible by (X − α)
h
, we have h ≤ deg(f). When h = 0, α
is not a root of f, i.e., f(α) 6 = 0. The interesting case is when α is a root of f.
1074 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
Definition 30.12. Given a ring A and any nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X], given any α ∈ A,
the unique h ≥ 0 such that f is divisible by (X − α)
h but not by (X − α)
h+1 is called the
order, or multiplicity, of α. We have h = 0 iff α is not a root of f, and when α is a root of f,
if h = 1, we call α a simple root, if h = 2, a double root, and generally, a root of multiplicity
h ≥ 2 is called a multiple root.
Observe that Proposition 30.20 (2) implies that if A ⊆ B, where A and B are rings, for
every nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X], if α ∈ A is a root of f, then the multiplicity of α with
respect to f ∈ A[X] and the multiplicity of α with respect to f considered as a polynomial
in B[X], is the same.
We now show that if the ring A is an integral domain, the number of roots of a nonzero
polynomial is at most its degree.
Proposition 30.21. Let f, g ∈ A[X] be nonnull polynomials, let α ∈ A, and let h ≥ 0 and
k ≥ 0 be the multiplicities of α with respect to f and g. The following properties hold.
(1) If l is the multiplicity of α with respect to (f + g), then l ≥ min(h, k). If h 6 = k, then
l = min(h, k).
(2) If m is the multiplicity of α with respect to fg, then m ≥ h + k. If A is an integral
domain, then m = h + k.
Proof. (1) We have f(X) = (X − α)
h
f1(X), g(X) = (X − α)
k
g1(X), with f1(α) 6 = 0 and
g1(α) 6 = 0. Clearly, l ≥ min(h, k). If h 6 = k, assume h < k. Then, we have
f(X) + g(X) = (X − α)
h
f1(X) + (X − α)
k
g1(X) = (X − α)
h
(f1(X) + (X − α)
k−h
g1(X)),
and since (f1(X) + (X − α)
k−h
g1(X))(α) = f1(α) 6 = 0, we have l = h = min(h, k).
(2) We have
f(X)g(X) = (X − α)
h+k
f1(X)g1(X),
with f1(α) 6 = 0 and g1(α) 6 = 0. Clearly, m ≥ h + k. If A is an integral domain, then
f1(α)g1(α) 6 = 0, and so m = h + k.
Proposition 30.22. Let A be an integral domain. Let f be any nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X]
and let α1, . . . , αm ∈ A be m ≥ 1 distinct roots of f of respective multiplicities k1, . . . , km.
Then, we have
f(X) = (X − α1)
k1
· · ·(X − αm)
kmg(X),
where g ∈ A[X] and g(αi) 6 = 0 for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Proof. We proceed by induction on m. The case m = 1 is obvious in view of Definition 30.12
(which itself, is justified by Proposition 30.20). If m ≥ 2, by the induction hypothesis, we
have
f(X) = (X − α1)
k1
· · ·(X − αm−1)
km−1 g1(X),
30.6. ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS 1075
where g1 ∈ A[X] and g1(αi) 6 = 0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1. Since A is an integral domain and
αi 6 = αj
for i 6 = j, since αm is a root of f, we have
0 = (αm − α1)
k1
· · ·(αm − αm−1)
km−1 g1(αm),
which implies that g1(αm) = 0. Now, by Proposition 30.21 (2), since αm is not a root of the
polynomial (X − α1)
k1
· · ·(X − αm−1)
km−1 and since A is an integral domain, αm must be a
root of multiplicity km of g1, which means that
g1(X) = (X − αm)
kmg(X),
with g(αm) 6 = 0. Since g1(αi) 6 = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 and A is an integral domain, we must
also have g(αi) 6 = 0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1. Thus, we have
f(X) = (X − α1)
k1
· · ·(X − αm)
kmg(X),
where g ∈ A[X], and g(αi) 6 = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
As a consequence of Proposition 30.22, we get the following important result.
Theorem 30.23. Let A be an integral domain. For every nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X], if
the degree of f is n = deg(f) and k1, . . . , km are the multiplicities of all the distinct roots of
f (where m ≥ 0), then k1 + · · · + km ≤ n.
Proof. Immediate from Proposition 30.22.
Since fields are integral domains, Theorem 30.23 holds for nonnull polynomials over fields
and in particular, for R and C. An important consequence of Theorem 30.23 is the following.
Proposition 30.24. Let A be an integral domain. For any two polynomials f, g ∈ A[X], if
deg(f) ≤ n, deg(g) ≤ n, and if there are n + 1 distinct elements α1, α2, . . . , αn+1 ∈ A (with
αi 6 = αj for i 6 = j) such that f(αi) = g(αi) for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, then f = g.
Proof. Assume f 6 = g, then, (f −g) is nonnull, and since f(αi) = g(αi) for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n+1,
the polynomial (f − g) has n + 1 distinct roots. Thus, (f − g) has n + 1 distinct roots and
is of degree at most n, which contradicts Theorem 30.23.
Proposition 30.24 is often used to show that polynomials coincide. We will use it to show
some interpolation formulae due to Lagrange and Hermite. But first, we characterize the
multiplicity of a root of a polynomial. For this, we need the notion of derivative familiar in
analysis. Actually, we can simply define this notion algebraically.
First, we need to rule out some undesirable behaviors. Given a field K, as we saw in
Example 2.8, we can define a homomorphism χ: Z → K given by
χ(n) = n · 1,
1076 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
where 1 is the multiplicative identity of K. Recall that we define n · a by
n · a = | a + · · ·
{z + a
}
n
if n ≥ 0 (with 0 · a = 0) and
n · a = −(−n) · a
if n < 0. We say that the field K is of characteristic zero if the homomorphism χ is injective.
Then, for any a ∈ K with a 6 = 0, we have n · a 6 = 0 for all n 6 = 0
The fields Q, R, and C are of characteristic zero. In fact, it is easy to see that every
field of characteristic zero contains a subfield isomorphic to Q. Thus, finite fields can’t be of
characteristic zero.
Remark: If a field is not of characteristic zero, it is not hard to show that its characteristic,
that is, the smallest n ≥ 2 such that n·1 = 0, is a prime number p. The characteristic p of K
is the generator of the principal ideal pZ, the kernel of the homomorphism χ: Z → K. Thus,
every finite field is of characteristic some prime p. Infinite fields of nonzero characteristic
also exist.
Definition 30.13. Let A be a ring. The derivative f
0 , or Df, or D1
f, of a polynomial
f ∈ A[X] is defined inductively as follows:
f
0 = 0, if f = 0, the null polynomial,
f
0 = 0, if f = a, a 6 = 0, a ∈ A,
f
0 = nanX
n−1 + (n − 1)an−1X
n−2 + · · · + 2a2X + a1,
if f = anX
n + an−1X
n−1 + · · · + a0, with n = deg(f) ≥ 1.
If A = K is a field of characteristic zero, if deg(f) ≥ 1, the leading coefficient nan of f
0 is
nonzero, and thus, f
0 is not the null polynomial. Thus, if A = K is a field of characteristic
zero, when n = deg(f) ≥ 1, we have deg(f
0 ) = n − 1.

For rings or for fields of characteristic p ≥ 2, we could have f
0 = 0, for a polynomial f
of degree ≥ 1.
The following standard properties of derivatives are recalled without proof (prove them
as an exercise).
Given any two polynomials, f, g ∈ A[X], we have
(f + g)
0 = f
0 + g
0 ,
(fg)
0 = f
0 g + fg0 .
For example, if f = (X − α)
k
g and k ≥ 1, we have
f
0 = k(X − α)
k−1
g + (X − α)
k
g
0 .
We can now give a criterion for the existence of simple roots. The first proposition holds for
any ring.
30.6. ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS 1077
Proposition 30.25. Let A be any ring. For every nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X], α ∈ A is
a simple root of f iff α is a root of f and α is not a root of f
0 .
Proof. Since α ∈ A is a root of f, we have f = (X − α)g for some g ∈ A[X]. Now, α is a
simple root of f iff g(α) 6 = 0. However, we have f
0 = g + (X − α)g
0 , and so f
0 (α) = g(α).
Thus, α is a simple root of f iff f
0 (α) 6 = 0.
We can improve the previous proposition as follows.
Proposition 30.26. Let A be any ring. For every nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X], let α ∈ A
be a root of multiplicity k ≥ 1 of f. Then, α is a root of multiplicity at least k − 1 of f
0 . If
A is a field of characteristic zero, then α is a root of multiplicity k − 1 of f
0 .
Proof. Since α ∈ A is a root of multiplicity k of f, we have f = (X −α)
k
g for some g ∈ A[X]
and g(α) 6 = 0. Since
f
0 = k(X − α)
k−1
g + (X − α)
k
g
0 = (X − α)
k−1
(kg + (X − α)g
0 ),
it is clear that the multiplicity of α w.r.t. f
0 is at least k−1. Now, (kg+(X−α)g
0 )(α) = kg(α),
and if A is of characteristic zero, since g(α) 6 = 0, then kg(α) 6 = 0. Thus, α is a root of
multiplicity k − 1 of f
0 .
As a consequence, we obtain the following test for the existence of a root of multiplicity
k for a polynomial f:
Given a field K of characteristic zero, for any nonnull polynomial f ∈ K[X], any α ∈ K
is a root of multiplicity k ≥ 1 of f iff α is a root of f, D1
f, D2
f, . . . , Dk−1
f, but not a root of
Dk
f.
We can now return to polynomial functions and tie up some loose ends. Given a ring A,
recall that every polynomial f ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn] induces a function fA : An → A defined such
that fA(α1, . . . , αn) = f(α1, . . . , αn), for every (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ An
. We now give a sufficient
condition for the mapping f 7→ fA to be injective.
Proposition 30.27. Let A be an integral domain. For every polynomial f ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn],
if A1, . . . , An are n infinite subsets of A such that f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0 for all (α1, . . . , αn) ∈
A1×· · ·×An, then f = 0, i.e., f is the null polynomial. As a consequence, if A is an infinite
integral domain, then the map f 7→ fA is injective.
Proof. We proceed by induction on n. Assume n = 1. If f ∈ A[X1] is nonnull, let m = deg(f)
be its degree. Since A1 is infinite and f(α1) = 0 for all α1 ∈ A1, then f has an infinite number
of roots. But since f is of degree m, this contradicts Theorem 30.23. Thus, f = 0.
If n ≥ 2, we can view f ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn] as a polynomial
f = gmXn
m + gm−1Xn
m−1 + · · · + g0,

where the coefficients gi are polynomials in A[X1, . . . , Xn−1]. Now, for every (α1, . . . , αn−1) ∈
A1 × · · · × An−1, f(α1, . . . , αn−1, Xn) determines a polynomial h(Xn) ∈ A[Xn], and since An
is infinite and h(αn) = f(α1, . . . , αn−1, αn) = 0 for all αn ∈ An, by the induction hypothesis,
we have gi(α1, . . . , αn−1) = 0. Now, since A1, . . . , An−1 are infinite, using the induction
hypothesis again, we get gi = 0, which shows that f is the null polynomial. The second part
of the proposition follows immediately from the first, by letting Ai = A.
When A is an infinite integral domain, in particular an infinite field, since the map f 7→ fA
is injective, we identify the polynomial f with the polynomial function fA, and we write fA
simply as f.
The following proposition can be very useful to show polynomial identities.
Proposition 30.28. Let A be an infinite integral domain and f, g1, . . . , gm ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn]
be polynomials. If the gi are nonnull polynomials and if
f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0 whenever gi(α1, . . . , αn) 6 = 0 for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m,
for every (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ An
, then
f = 0,
i.e., f is the null polynomial.
Proof. If f is not the null polynomial, since the gi are nonnull and A is an integral domain,
then the product fg1 · · · gm is nonnull. By Proposition 30.27, only the null polynomial maps
to the zero function, and thus there must be some (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ An
, such that
f(α1, . . . , αn)g1(α1, . . . , αn)· · · gm(α1, . . . , αn) 6 = 0,
but this contradicts the hypothesis.
Proposition 30.28 is often called the principle of extension of algebraic identities. Another
perhaps more illuminating way of stating this proposition is as follows: For any polynomial
g ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn], let
V (g) = {(α1, . . . , αn) ∈ A
n
| g(α1, . . . , αn) = 0},
the set of zeros of g. Note that V (g1) ∪ · · · ∪ V (gm) = V (g1 · · · gm). Then, Proposition 30.28
can be stated as:
If f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0 for every (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ An − V (g1 · · · gm), then f = 0.
In other words, if the algebraic identity f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0 holds on the complement of
V (g1) ∪ · · · ∪ V (gm) = V (g1 · · · gm), then f(α1, . . . , αn) = 0 holds everywhere in An
. With
this second formulation, we understand better the terminology “principle of extension of
algebraic identities.”
30.7. POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION (LAGRANGE, NEWTON, HERMITE) 1079
Remark: Letting U(g) = A−V (g), the identity V (g1)∪· · ·∪V (gm) = V (g1 · · · gm) translates
to U(g1) ∩ · · · ∩ U(gm) = U(g1 · · · gm). This suggests to define a topology on A whose basis
of open sets consists of the sets U(g). In this topology (called the Zariski topology), the
sets of the form V (g) are closed sets. Also, when g1, . . . , gm ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn] and n ≥ 2,
understanding the structure of the closed sets of the form V (g1)∩· · ·∩V (gm) is quite difficult,
and it is the object of algebraic geometry (at least, its classical part).

When f ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn] and n ≥ 2, one should not apply Proposition 30.27 abusively.
For example, let
f(X, Y ) = X
2 + Y
2 − 1,
considered as a polynomial in R[X, Y ]. Since R is an infinite field and since
f

− 1 = 0,
for every t ∈ R, it would be tempting to say that f = 0. But what’s wrong with the above
reasoning is that there are no two infinite subsets R1, R2 of R such that f(α1, α2) = 0 for
all (α1, α2) ∈ R
2
. For every α1 ∈ R, there are at most two α2 ∈ R such that f(α1, α2) = 0.
What the example shows though, is that a nonnull polynomial f ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn] where
n ≥ 2 can have an infinite number of zeros. This is in contrast with nonnull polynomials in
one variables over an infinite field (which have a number of roots bounded by their degree).
We now look at polynomial interpolation.
30.7 Polynomial Interpolation (Lagrange, Newton,
Hermite)
Let K be a field. First, we consider the following interpolation problem: Given a sequence
(α1, . . . , αm+1) of pairwise distinct scalars in K and any sequence (β1, . . . , βm+1) of scalars
in K, where the βj are not necessarily distinct, find a polynomial P(X) of degree ≤ m such
that
P(α1) = β1, . . . , P(αm+1) = βm+1.
First, observe that if such a polynomial exists, then it is unique. Indeed, this is a
consequence of Proposition 30.24. Thus, we just have to find any polynomial of degree ≤ m.
Consider the following so-called Lagrange polynomials:
Li(X) = (X − α1)· · ·(X − αi−1)(X − αi+1)· · ·(X − αm+1)
(αi − α1)· · ·(αi − αi−1)(αi − αi+1)· · ·(αi − αm+1)
.
Note that L(αi) = 1 and that L(αj ) = 0, for all j 6 = i. But then,
P(X) = β1L1 + · · · + βm+1Lm+1
1080 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
is the unique desired polynomial, since clearly, P(αi) = βi
. Such a polynomial is called a
Lagrange interpolant. Also note that the polynomials (L1, . . . , Lm+1) form a basis of the
vector space of all polynomials of degree ≤ m. Indeed, if we had
λ1L1(X) + · · · + λm+1Lm+1(X) = 0,
setting X to αi
, we would get λi = 0. Thus, the Li are linearly independent, and by the
previous argument, they are a set of generators. We we call (L1, . . . , Lm+1) the Lagrange
basis (of order m + 1).
It is known from numerical analysis that from a computational point of view, the Lagrange
basis is not very good. Newton proposed another solution, the method of divided differences.
Consider the polynomial P(X) of degree ≤ m, called the Newton interpolant,
P(X) = λ0 + λ1(X − α1) + λ2(X − α1)(X − α2) + · · · + λm(X − α1)(X − α2)· · ·(X − αm).
Then, the λi can be determined by successively setting X to, α1, α2, . . . , αm+1. More
precisely, we define inductively the polynomials Q(X) and Q(α1, . . . , αi
, X), for 1 ≤ i ≤ m,
as follows:
Q(X) = P(X)
Q1(α1, X) = Q(X) − Q(α1)
X − α1
Q(α1, α2, X) = Q(α1, X) − Q(α1, α2)
X − α2
. . .
Q(α1, . . . , αi
, X) = Q(α1, . . . , αi−1, X) − Q(α1, . . . , αi−1, αi)
X − αi
,
. . .
Q(α1, . . . , αm, X) = Q(α1, . . . , αm−1, X) − Q(α1, . . . , αm−1, αm)
X − αm
.
By induction on i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, it is easily verified that
Q(X) = P(X),
Q(α1, . . . , αi
, X) = λi + λi+1(X − αi+1) + · · · + λm(X − αi+1)· · ·(X − αm),
Q(α1, . . . , αm, X) = λm.
From the above expressions, it is clear that
λ0 = Q(α1),
λi = Q(α1, . . . , αi
, αi+1),
λm = Q(α1, . . . , αm, αm+1).
30.7. POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION (LAGRANGE, NEWTON, HERMITE) 1081
The expression Q(α1, α2, . . . , αi+1) is called the i-th difference quotient. Then, we can
compute the λi
in terms of β1 = P(α1), . . . , βm+1 = P(αm+1), using the inductive formulae
for the Q(α1, . . . , αi
, X) given above, initializing the Q(αi) such that Q(αi) = βi
.
The above method is called the method of divided differences and it is due to Newton.
An astute observation may be used to optimize the computation. Observe that if Pi(X)
is the polynomial of degree ≤ i taking the values β1, . . . , βi+1 at the points α1, . . . , αi+1, then
the coefficient of Xi
in Pi(X) is Q(α1, α2, . . . , αi+1), which is the value of λi
in the Newton
interpolant
Pi(X) = λ0 + λ1(X − α1) + λ2(X − α1)(X − α2) + · · · + λi(X − α1)(X − α2)· · ·(X − αi).
As a consequence, Q(α1, α2, . . . , αi+1) does not depend on the specific ordering of the αj
and there are better ways of computing it. For example, Q(α1, α2, . . . , αi+1) can be computed
using
Q(α1, . . . , αi+1) = Q(α2, . . . , αi+1) − Q(α1, . . . , αi)
αi+1 − α1
.
Then, the computation can be arranged into a triangular array reminiscent of Pascal’s
triangle, as follows:
Initially, Q(αj ) = βj
, 1 ≤ j ≤ m + 1, and
Q(α1)
Q(α1, α2)
Q(α2) Q(α1, α2, α3)
Q(α2, α3) . . .
Q(α3) Q(α2, α3, α4)
Q(α3, α4) . . .
Q(α4) . . .
. . .
In this computation, each successive column is obtained by forming the difference quo￾tients of the preceeding column according to the formula
Q(αk, . . . , αi+k) = Q(αk+1, . . . , αi+k) − Q(αk, . . . , αi+k−1)
αi+k − αk
.
The λi are the elements of the descending diagonal.
Observe that if we performed the above computation starting with a polynomial Q(X)
of degree m, we could extend it by considering new given points αm+2, αm+3, etc. Then,
from what we saw above, the (m + 1)th column consists of λm in the expression of Q(X) as
a Newton interpolant and the (m + 2)th column consists of zeros. Such divided differences
are used in numerical analysis.
1082 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
Newton’s method can be used to compute the value P(α) at some α of the interpolant
P(X) taking the values β1, . . . , βm+1 for the (distinct) arguments α1, . . . , αm+1. We also
mention that inductive methods for computing P(α) without first computing the coefficients
of the Newton interpolant exist, for example, Aitken’s method. For this method, the reader
is referred to Farin [58].
It has been observed that Lagrange interpolants oscillate quite badly as their degree
increases, and thus, this makes them undesirable as a stable method for interpolation. A
standard example due to Runge, is the function
f(x) = 1
1 + x
2
,
in the interval [−5, +5]. Assuming a uniform distribution of points on the curve in the
interval [−5, +5], as the degree of the Lagrange interpolant increases, the interpolant shows
wilder and wilder oscillations around the points x = −5 and x = +5. This phenomenon
becomes quite noticeable beginning for degree 14, and gets worse and worse. For degree 22,
things are quite bad! Equivalently, one may consider the function
f(x) = 1
1 + 25x
2
,
in the interval [−1, +1].
We now consider a more general interpolation problem which will lead to the Hermite
polynomials.
We consider the following interpolation problem:
Given a sequence (α1, . . . , αm+1) of pairwise distinct scalars in K, integers n1, . . . , nm+1
where nj ≥ 0, and m + 1 sequences (βj
0
, . . . , βj
nj
) of scalars in K, letting
n = n1 + · · · + nm+1 + m,
find a polynomial P of degree ≤ n, such that
P(α1) = β1
0
, . . . P(αm+1) = βm

+1,
D1P(α1) = β1

DiP(α1) = β1

. . .
Dn1P(α1) = β1
n1
, . . . Dnm+1P(αm+1) = βm
nm

.
Note that the above equations constitute n + 1 constraints, and thus, we can expect that
there is a unique polynomial of degree ≤ n satisfying the above problem. This is indeed the
case and such a polynomial is called a Hermite polynomial. We call the above problem the
Hermite interpolation problem.
30.7. POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION (LAGRANGE, NEWTON, HERMITE) 1083
Proposition 30.29. The Hermite interpolation problem has a unique solution of degree ≤ n,
where n = n1 + · · · + nm+1 + m.
Proof. First, we prove that the Hermite interpolation problem has at most one solution.
Assume that P and Q are two distinct solutions of degree ≤ n. Then, by Proposition 30.26
and the criterion following it, P −Q has among its roots α1 of multiplicity at least n1+1, . . .,
αm+1 of multiplicity at least nm+1 + 1. However, by Theorem 30.23, we should have
n1 + 1 + · · · + nm+1 + 1 = n1 + · · · + nm+1 + m + 1 ≤ n,
which is a contradiction, since n = n1 + · · · + nm+1 + m. Thus, P = Q. We are left with
proving the existence of a Hermite interpolant. A quick way to do so is to use Proposition
7.12, which tells us that given a square matrix A over a field K, the following properties
hold:
For every column vector B, there is a unique column vector X such that AX = B iff the
only solution to AX = 0 is the trivial vector X = 0 iff D(A) 6 = 0.
If we let P = y0 + y1X + · · · + ynXn
, the Hermite interpolation problem yields a linear
system of equations in the unknowns (y0, . . . , yn) with some associated (n+1)×(n+1) matrix
A. Now, the system AY = 0 has a solution iff P has among its roots α1 of multiplicity at
least n1 + 1, . . ., αm+1 of multiplicity at least nm+1 + 1. By the previous argument, since P
has degree ≤ n, we must have P = 0, that is, Y = 0. This concludes the proof.
Proposition 30.29 shows the existence of unique polynomials Hj
i
(X) of degree ≤ n such
that DiHj
i
(αj ) = 1 and DkHj
i
(αl) = 0, for k 6 = i or l 6 = j, 1 ≤ j, l ≤ m + 1, 0 ≤ i, k ≤ nj
.
The polynomials Hj
i are called Hermite basis polynomials.
One problem with Proposition 30.29 is that it does not give an explicit way of computing
the Hermite basis polynomials. We first show that this can be done explicitly in the special
cases n1 = . . . = nm+1 = 1, and n1 = . . . = nm+1 = 2, and then suggest a method using a
generalized Newton interpolant.
Assume that n1 = . . . = nm+1 = 1. We try Hj
0 = (a(X − αj ) + b)L
2
j
, and Hj
1 =
(c(X − αj ) + d)L
2
j
, where Lj
is the Lagrange interpolant determined earlier. Since
DHj
0 = aL2
j + 2(a(X − αj ) + b)LjDLj
,
requiring that Hj
0
(αj ) = 1, Hj
0
(αk) = 0, DHj
0
(αj ) = 0, and DHj
0
(αk) = 0, for k 6 = j, implies
b = 1 and a = −2DLj (αj ). Similarly, from the requirements Hj
1
(αj ) = 0, Hj
1
(αk) = 0,
DHj
1
(αj ) = 1, and DHj
1
(αk) = 0, k 6 = j, we get c = 1 and d = 0.
Thus, we have the Hermite polynomials
Hj
0 = (1 − 2DLj (αj )(X − αj ))L
2
j
, Hj
1 = (X − αj )L

.
1084 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
In the special case where m = 1, α1 = 0, and α2 = 1, we leave as an exercise to show
that the Hermite polynomials are
H0
0 = 2X

H1
0 = −2X

.
As a consequence, the polynomial P of degree 3 such that P(0) = x0, P(1) = x1,
P
0 (0) = m0, and P
0 (1) = m1, can be written as
P(X) = x0(2X
3 − 3X
2 + 1) + m0(X
3 − 2X
2 + X) + m1(X
3 − X
2
) + x1(−2X
3 + 3X
2
).
If we want the polynomial P of degree 3 such that P(a) = x0, P(b) = x1, P
0 (a) = m0,
and P
0 (b) = m1, where b 6 = a, then we have
P(X) = x0(2t
3 − 3t
2 + 1) + (b − a)m0(t
3 − 2t
2 + t) + (b − a)m1(t

) + x1(−2t
3 + 3t
2
),
where
t =
X − a
b − a
.
Observe the presence of the extra factor (b − a) in front of m0 and m1, the formula would
be false otherwise!
We now consider the case where n1 = . . . = nm+1 = 2. Let us try
