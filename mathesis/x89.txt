of E = Kn
, and and XI − A is the matrix of ψ with respect to the basis (e1, . . . , en)
36.5. THE SMITH NORMAL FORM 1313
(over K[X]). What Theorem 36.20 tells us is that there are K[X]-bases (u1, . . . , un) and
(v1, . . . , vn) of Ef with respect to which the matrix of ψ is D. Then
ψ(ui) = vi
, i = 1, . . . , n − m,
ψ(un−m+i) = qivn−m+i
, i = 1, . . . , m,
and because Im(ψ) = Ker (σ), this implies that
σ(vi) = 0, i = 1, . . . , n − m.
Consequently, w1 = σ(vn−m+1), . . . , wm = σ(vn) span Ef as a K[X]-module, with wi ∈ E,
and we have
M(f) = K[X]w1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ K[X]wm,
where K[X]wi ≈ K[X]/(qi) as a cyclic K[X]-module. Since Im(ψ) = Ker (σ), we have
0 = σ(ψ(un−m+i)) = σ(qivn−m+i) = qiσ(vn−m+i) = qiwi
,
so as a K-vector space, the cyclic subspace Z(wi
; f) = K[X]wi has qi as annihilator, and by
a remark from Section 36.1, it has the basis (over K)
(wi
, f(wi), . . . , f ni−1
(wi)), ni = deg(qi).
Furthermore, over this basis, the restriction of f to Z(wi
; f) is represented by the companion
matrix of qi
. By putting all these bases together, we obtain a block matrix which is the
canonical rational form of f (and A).
Now, XI −A = QDP −1
is the matrix of ψ with respect to the canonical basis (e1, . . . , en)
(over K[X]), and D is the matrix of ψ with respect to the bases (u1, . . . , un) and (v1, . . . , vn)
(over K[X]), which tells us that the columns of Q consist of the coordinates (in K[X]) of the
basis vectors (v1, . . . , vn) with respect to the basis (e1, . . . , en). Therefore, the coordinates (in
K) of the vectors (w1, . . . , wm) spanning Ef over K[X], where wi = σ(vn−m+i), are obtained
by substituting the matrix A for X in the coordinates of the columns vectors of Q, and
evaluating the resulting expressions.
Since
D = Q
−1
(XI − A)P,
the matrix D is obtained from A by a sequence of elementary row operations whose product
is Q−1 and a sequence of elementary column operations whose product is P. Therefore, to
compute the vectors w1, . . . , wm from A, we simply have to figure out how to construct Q
from the sequence of elementary row operations that yield Q−1
. The trick is to use column
operations to gather a product of row operations in reverse order.
Indeed, if Q−1
is the product of elementary row operations
Q
−1 = Ek · · · E2E1,
1314 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
then
Q = E1
−1E2
−1
· · · Ek
−1
.
Now, row operations operate on the left and column operations operate on the right, so
the product E1
−1E2
−1
· · · Ek
−1
can be computed from left to right as a sequence of column
operations.
Let us review the meaning of the elementary row and column operations P(i, k), Ei,j;β,
and Ei,λ.
1. As a row operation, P(i, k) permutes row i and row k.
2. As a column operation, P(i, k) permutes column i and column k.
3. The inverse of P(i, k) is P(i, k) itself.
4. As a row operation, Ei,j;β adds β times row j to row i.
5. As a column operation, Ei,j;β adds β times column i to column j (note the switch in
the indices).
6. The inverse of Ei,j;β is Ei,j;−β.
7. As a row operation, Ei,λ multiplies row i by λ.
8. As a column operation, Ei,λ multiplies column i by λ.
9. The inverse of Ei,λ is Ei,λ−1 .
Given a square matrix A (over K), the row and column operations applied to XI − A in
converting it to its Smith normal form may involve coefficients that are polynomials and it
is necessary to explain what is the action of an operation Ei,j;β in this case. If the coefficient
β in Ei,j;β is a polynomial over K, as a row operation, the action of Ei,j;β on a matrix X is
to multiply the jth row of M by the matrix β(A) obtained by substituting the matrix A for
X and then to add the resulting vector to row i. Similarly, as a column operation, the action
of Ei,j;β on a matrix X is to multiply the ith column of M by the matrix β(A) obtained
by substituting the matrix A for X and then to add the resulting vector to column j. An
algorithm to compute the rational canonical form of a matrix can now be given. We apply
the elementary column operations Ei
−1
for i = 1, . . . k, starting with the identity matrix.
Algorithm for Converting an n × n matrix to Rational Canonical Form
While applying elementary row and column operations to compute the Smith normal
form D of XI − A, keep track of the row operations and perform the following steps:
1. Let P
0 = In, and for every elementary row operation E do the following:
(a) If E = P(i, k), permute column i and column k of P
0 .
36.5. THE SMITH NORMAL FORM 1315
(b) If E = Ei,j;β, multiply the ith column of P
0 by the matrix β(A) obtained by
substituting the matrix A for X, and then subtract the resulting vector from
column j.
(c) If E = Ei,λ where λ ∈ K, then multiply the ith column of P
0 by λ
−1
.
2. When step (1) terminates, the first n − m columns of P
0 are zero and the last m are
linearly independent. For i = 1, . . . , m, multiply the (n − m + i)th column wi of P
0
successively by I, A1
, A2
, Ani−1
, where ni
is the degree of the polynomial qi (appearing
in D), and form the n × n matrix P consisting of the vectors
w1, Aw1, . . . , An1−1w1, w2, Aw2, . . . , An2−1w2, . . . , wm, Awm, . . . , Anm−1wm.
Then, P
−1AP is the canonical rational form of A.
Here is an example taken from Dummit and Foote [54] (Chapter 12, Section 12.2). Let
A be the matrix
A =

One should check that the following sequence of row and column operations produces the
Smith normal form D of XI − A:
row P(1, 3) row E1,−1 row E2,1;2 row E3,1;−(X−1) column E1,3;X−1 column E1,4;2

37.1 Metric Spaces and Normed Vector Spaces
This chapter contains a review of basic topological concepts. First metric spaces are defined.
Next normed vector spaces are defined. Closed and open sets are defined, and their basic
properties are stated. The general concept of a topological space is defined. The closure
and the interior of a subset are defined. The subspace topology and the product topology
are defined. Continuous maps and homeomorphisms are defined. Limits of sequences are
defined. Continuous linear maps and multilinear maps are defined and studied briefly. The
chapter ends with the definition of a normed affine space.
Most spaces considered in this book have a topological structure given by a metric or a
norm, and we first review these notions. We begin with metric spaces. Recall that R+ =
{x ∈ R | x ≥ 0}.
Definition 37.1. A metric space is a set E together with a function d: E × E → R+,
called a metric, or distance, assigning a nonnegative real number d(x, y) to any two points
x, y ∈ E, and satisfying the following conditions for all x, y, z ∈ E:
(D1) d(x, y) = d(y, x). (symmetry)
(D2) d(x, y) ≥ 0, and d(x, y) = 0 iff x = y. (positivity)
(D3) d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, z). (triangle inequality)
Geometrically, Condition (D3) expresses the fact that in a triangle with vertices x, y, z,
the length of any side is bounded by the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. From
(D3), we immediately get
|d(x, y) − d(y, z)| ≤ d(x, z).
Let us give some examples of metric spaces. Recall that the absolute value |x| of a real
number x ∈ R is defined such that |x| = x if x ≥ 0, |x| = −x if x < 0, and for a complex
number x = a + ib, by |x| =
√
a
2 + b
2
.
1319
1320 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Example 37.1.
1. Let E = R, and d(x, y) = |x − y|, the absolute value of x − y. This is the so-called
natural metric on R.
2. Let E = R
n
(or E = C
n
). We have the Euclidean metric
d2(x, y) = ￾ |x1 − y1|
2 + · · · + |xn − yn|
2

1
2
,
the distance between the points (x1, . . . , xn) and (y1, . . . , yn).
3. For every set E, we can define the discrete metric, defined such that d(x, y) = 1 iff
x 6 = y, and d(x, x) = 0.
4. For any a, b ∈ R such that a < b, we define the following sets:
[a, b] = {x ∈ R | a ≤ x ≤ b}, (closed interval)
(a, b) = {x ∈ R | a < x < b}, (open interval)
[a, b) = {x ∈ R | a ≤ x < b}, (interval closed on the left, open on the right)
(a, b] = {x ∈ R | a < x ≤ b}, (interval open on the left, closed on the right)
Let E = [a, b], and d(x, y) = |x − y|. Then, ([a, b], d) is a metric space.
We will need to define the notion of proximity in order to define convergence of limits
and continuity of functions. For this we introduce some standard “small neighborhoods.”
Definition 37.2. Given a metric space E with metric d, for every a ∈ E, for every ρ ∈ R,
with ρ > 0, the set
B(a, ρ) = {x ∈ E | d(a, x) ≤ ρ}
is called the closed ball of center a and radius ρ, the set
B0(a, ρ) = {x ∈ E | d(a, x) < ρ}
is called the open ball of center a and radius ρ, and the set
S(a, ρ) = {x ∈ E | d(a, x) = ρ}
is called the sphere of center a and radius ρ. It should be noted that ρ is finite (i.e., not
+∞). A subset X of a metric space E is bounded if there is a closed ball B(a, ρ) such that
X ⊆ B(a, ρ).
Clearly, B(a, ρ) = B0(a, ρ) ∪ S(a, ρ).
Example 37.2.
37.1. METRIC SPACES AND NORMED VECTOR SPACES 1321
1. In E = R with the distance |x − y|, an open ball of center a and radius ρ is the open
interval (a − ρ, a + ρ).
2. In E = R
2 with the Euclidean metric, an open ball of center a and radius ρ is the set
of points inside the disk of center a and radius ρ, excluding the boundary points on
the circle.
3. In E = R
3 with the Euclidean metric, an open ball of center a and radius ρ is the set
of points inside the sphere of center a and radius ρ, excluding the boundary points on
the sphere.
One should be aware that intuition can be misleading in forming a geometric image of a
closed (or open) ball. For example, if d is the discrete metric, a closed ball of center a and
radius ρ < 1 consists only of its center a, and a closed ball of center a and radius ρ ≥ 1
consists of the entire space!

If E = [a, b], and d(x, y) = |x − y|, as in Example 37.1, an open ball B0(a, ρ), with
ρ < b − a, is in fact the interval [a, a + ρ), which is closed on the left.
We now consider a very important special case of metric spaces, normed vector spaces.
Normed vector spaces have already been defined in Chapter 9 (Definition 9.1) but for the
reader’s convenience we repeat the definition.
Definition 37.3. Let E be a vector space over a field K, where K is either the field R of
reals, or the field C of complex numbers. A norm on E is a function k k : E → R+, assigning
a nonnegative real number k uk to any vector u ∈ E, and satisfying the following conditions
for all x, y, z ∈ E:
(N1) k xk ≥ 0, and k xk = 0 iff x = 0. (positivity)
(N2) k λxk = |λ| kxk . (scaling)
(N3) k x + yk ≤ kxk + k yk . (triangle inequality)
A vector space E together with a norm k k is called a normed vector space.
From (N3), we easily get
|kxk − kyk| ≤ kx − yk .
Given a normed vector space E, if we define d such that
d(x, y) = k x − yk ,
it is easily seen that d is a metric. Thus, every normed vector space is immediately a metric
space. Note that the metric associated with a norm is invariant under translation, that is,
d(x + u, y + u) = d(x, y).
1322 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
For this reason, we can restrict ourselves to open or closed balls of center 0.
Examples of normed vector spaces were given in Example 9.1. We repeat the most
important examples.
Example 37.3. Let E = R
n
(or E = C
n
). There are three standard norms. For every
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ E, we have the norm k xk 1, defined such that,
k
xk 1 = |x1| + · · · + |xn|,
we have the Euclidean norm k xk 2, defined such that,
k
xk 2 =
￾ |x1|
2 + · · · + |xn|
2

1
2
,
and the sup-norm k xk ∞, defined such that,
k
xk ∞ = max{|xi
| | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
More generally, we define the ` p-norm (for p ≥ 1) by
k
xk p = (|x1|
p + · · · + |xn|
p
)
1/p
.
We proved in Proposition 9.1 that the ` p-norms are indeed norms. The closed unit balls
centered at (0, 0) for kk 1, kk 2, and kk ∞, along with the containment relationships, are shown
in Figures 37.1 and 37.2. Figures 37.3 and 37.4 illustrate the situation in R

In a normed vector space we define a closed ball or an open ball of radius ρ as a closed
ball or an open ball of center 0. We may use the notation B(ρ) and B0(ρ).
We will now define the crucial notions of open sets and closed sets, and of a topological
space.

Definition 37.4. Let (E, d) be a metric space. A subset U ⊆ E is an open set in E if either
U = ∅, or for every a ∈ U, there is some open ball B0(a, ρ) such that, B0(a, ρ) ⊆ U.

the peach set U is surrounded by a small raspberry open set which lies within U.
The set E itself is open, since for every a ∈ E, every open ball of center a is contained in
E. In E = R
n
, given n intervals [ai
, bi
], with ai < bi
, it is easy to show that the open n-cube
{(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ E | ai < xi < bi
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
is an open set. In fact, it is possible to find a metric for which such open n-cubes are open
balls! Similarly, we can define the closed n-cube
{(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ E | ai ≤ xi ≤ bi
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n},
which is a closed set.
The open sets satisfy some important properties that lead to the definition of a topological
space.
1Recall that ρ > 0.
37.1. METRIC SPACES AND NORMED VECTOR SPACES 1325
Proposition 37.1. Given a metric space E with metric d, the family O of all open sets
defined in Definition 37.4 satisfies the following properties:
(O1) For every finite family (Ui)1≤i≤n of sets Ui ∈ O, we have U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un ∈ O, i.e., O is
closed under finite intersections.
(O2) For every arbitrary family (Ui)i∈I of sets Ui ∈ O, we have S i∈I Ui ∈ O, i.e., O is closed
under arbitrary unions.
(O3) ∅ ∈ O, and E ∈ O, i.e., ∅ and E belong to O.
Furthermore, for any two distinct points a 6 = b in E, there exist two open sets Ua and Ub
such that, a ∈ Ua, b ∈ Ub, and Ua ∩ Ub = ∅.
Proof. It is straightforward. For the last point, letting ρ = d(a, b)/3 (in fact ρ = d(a, b)/2
works too), we can pick Ua = B0(a, ρ) and Ub = B0(b, ρ). By the triangle inequality, we
must have Ua ∩ Ub = ∅.
The above proposition leads to the very general concept of a topological space.

One should be careful that, in general, the family of open sets is not closed under infinite
intersections. For example, in R under the metric |x − y|, letting Un = (−1/n, +1/n),
each Un is open, but T n Un = {0}, which is not open.
Later on, given any nonempty subset A of a metric space (E, d), we will need to know
that certain special sets containing A are open.
Definition 37.5. Let (E, d) be a metric space. For any nonempty subset A of E and any
x ∈ E, let
d(x, A) = inf
a∈A
d(x, a).
Proposition 37.2. Let (E, d) be a metric space. For any nonempty subset A of E and for
any two points x, y ∈ E, we have
|d(x, A) − d(y, A)| ≤ d(x, y).
Proof. For all a ∈ A we have
d(x, a) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, a),
which implies
d(x, A) = inf
a∈A
d(x, a)
≤ inf
a∈A
(d(x, y) + d(y, a))
= d(x, y) + inf
a∈A
d(y, a)
= d(x, y) + d(y, A).
1326 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
By symmetry, we also obtain d(y, A) ≤ d(x, y) + d(x, A), and thus
|d(x, A) − d(y, A)| ≤ d(x, y),
as claimed.
Definition 37.6. Let (E, d) be a metric space. For any nonempty subset A of E, and any
r > 0, let
Vr(A) = {x ∈ E | d(x, A) < r}.
Proposition 37.3. Let (E, d) be a metric space. For any nonempty subset A of E, and any
r > 0, the set Vr(A) is an open set containing A.
Proof. For any y ∈ E such that d(x, y) < r − d(x, A), by Proposition 37.2 we have
d(y, A) ≤ d(x, A) + d(x, y) ≤ d(x, A) + r − d(x, A) = r,
so Vr(A) contains the open ball B0(x, r − d(x, A)), which means that it is open. Obviously,
A ⊆ Vr(A).
37.2 Topological Spaces
Motivated by Proposition 37.1, a topological space is defined in terms of a family of sets
satisfying the properties of open sets stated in that proposition.
Definition 37.7. Given a set E, a topology on E (or a topological structure on E), is defined
as a family O of subsets of E called open sets, and satisfying the following three properties:
(1) For every finite family (Ui)1≤i≤n of sets Ui ∈ O, we have U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un ∈ O, i.e., O is
closed under finite intersections.
(2) For every arbitrary family (Ui)i∈I of sets Ui ∈ O, we have S i∈I Ui ∈ O, i.e., O is closed
under arbitrary unions.
(3) ∅ ∈ O, and E ∈ O, i.e., ∅ and E belong to O.
A set E together with a topology O on E is called a topological space. Given a topological
space (E, O), a subset F of E is a closed set if F = E − U for some open set U ∈ O, i.e., F
is the complement of some open set.

It is possible that an open set is also a closed set. For example, ∅ and E are both open
and closed. When a topological space contains a proper nonempty subset U which is
both open and closed, the space E is said to be disconnected.
37.2. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES 1327
Definition 37.8. A topological space (E, O) is said to satisfy the Hausdorff separation
axiom (or T2-separation axiom) if for any two distinct points a 6 = b in E, there exist two
open sets Ua and Ub such that, a ∈ Ua, b ∈ Ub, and Ua ∩ Ub = ∅. When the T2-separation
axiom is satisfied, we also say that (E, O) is a Hausdorff space.
As shown by Proposition 37.1, any metric space is a topological Hausdorff space, the
family of open sets being in fact the family of arbitrary unions of open balls. Similarly,
any normed vector space is a topological Hausdorff space, the family of open sets being the
family of arbitrary unions of open balls. The topology O consisting of all subsets of E is
called the discrete topology.
Remark: Most (if not all) spaces used in analysis are Hausdorff spaces. Intuitively, the
Hausdorff separation axiom says that there are enough “small” open sets. Without this
axiom, some counter-intuitive behaviors may arise. For example, a sequence may have more
than one limit point (or a compact set may not be closed). Nevertheless, non-Hausdorff
topological spaces arise naturally in algebraic geometry. But even there, some substitute for
separation is used.
One of the reasons why topological spaces are important is that the definition of a topol￾ogy only involves a certain family O of sets, and not how such family is generated from
a metric or a norm. For example, different metrics or different norms can define the same
family of open sets. Many topological properties only depend on the family O and not on
the specific metric or norm. But the fact that a topology is definable from a metric or a
norm is important, because it usually implies nice properties of a space. All our examples
will be spaces whose topology is defined by a metric or a norm.
Definition 37.9. A topological space (E, O) is metrizable if there is a distance on E defining
the topology O.
Note that in a metric space (E, d), the metric d is explicitly given. However, in general,
the topology of a metrizable space (E, O) is not specified by an explicitly given metric, but
some metric defining the topology O exists. Obviously, a metrizable topological space must
be Hausdorff. Actually, a stronger separation property holds, a metrizable space is normal;
see Definition 37.30.
Remark: By taking complements we can state properties of the closed sets dual to those
of Definition 37.7. Thus, ∅ and E are closed sets, and the closed sets are closed under finite
unions and arbitrary intersections.
It is also worth noting that the Hausdorff separation axiom implies that for every a ∈ E,
the set {a} is closed. Indeed, if x ∈ E − {a}, then x 6 = a, and so there exist open sets Ua and
Ux such that a ∈ Ua, x ∈ Ux, and Ua∩Ux = ∅. See Figure 37.6. Thus, for every x ∈ E − {a},
there is an open set Ux containing x and contained in E − {a}, showing by (O3) that E − {a}
is open, and thus that the set {a} is closed.

Given a topological space (E, O), given any subset A of E, since E ∈ O and E is a closed
set, the family CA = {F | A ⊆ F, F a closed set} of closed sets containing A is nonempty,
and since any arbitrary intersection of closed sets is a closed set, the intersection T CA of
the sets in the family CA is the smallest closed set containing A. By a similar reasoning, the
union of all the open subsets contained in A is the largest open set contained in A.
Definition 37.10. Given a topological space (E, O), given any subset A of E, the smallest
closed set containing A is denoted by A, and is called the closure, or adherence of A. See
Figure 37.7. A subset A of E is dense in E if A = E. The largest open set contained in A
is denoted by
◦
A, and is called the interior of A. See Figure 37.8. The set Fr A = A ∩ E − A
is called the boundary (or frontier) of A. We also denote the boundary of A by ∂A. See
Figure 37.9.

Remark: The notation A for the closure of a subset A of E is somewhat unfortunate,
since A is often used to denote the set complement of A in E. Still, we prefer it to more
cumbersome notations such as clo(A), and we denote the complement of A in E by E − A
(or sometimes, Ac
).
By definition, it is clear that a subset A of E is closed iff A = A. The set Q of rationals
is dense in R. It is easily shown that A =
◦
A ∪ ∂A and
◦
A ∩ ∂A = ∅. Another useful
characterization of A is given by the following proposition.
1330 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Proposition 37.4. Given a topological space (E, O), given any subset A of E, the closure
A of A is the set of all points x ∈ E such that for every open set U containing x, then
U ∩ A 6 = ∅. See Figure 37.10.

Figure 37.10: The topological space (E, O) is R
2 with topology induced by the Euclidean
metric. The purple subset A is illustrated with three red points, each in its closure since the
open ball centered at each point has nontrivial intersection with A.
Proof. If A = ∅, since ∅ is closed, the proposition holds trivially. Thus, assume that A 6 = ∅.
First assume that x ∈ A. Let U be any open set such that x ∈ U. If U ∩ A = ∅, since U is
open, then E − U is a closed set containing A, and since A is the intersection of all closed
sets containing A, we must have x ∈ E − U, which is impossible. Conversely, assume that
x ∈ E is a point such that for every open set U containing x, then U ∩ A 6 = ∅. Let F be
any closed subset containing A. If x /∈ F, since F is closed, then U = E − F is an open set
such that x ∈ U, and U ∩ A = ∅, a contradiction. Thus, we have x ∈ F for every closed set
containing A, that is, x ∈ A.
Often it is necessary to consider a subset A of a topological space E, and to view the
subset A as a topological space. The following proposition shows how to define a topology
on a subset.
Proposition 37.5. Given a topological space (E, O), given any subset A of E, let
U = {U ∩ A | U ∈ O}
be the family of all subsets of A obtained as the intersection of any open set in O with A.
The following properties hold.
37.2. TOPOLOGICAL SPACES 1331
(1) The space (A, U) is a topological space.
(2) If E is a metric space with metric d, then the restriction dA : A × A → R+ of the
metric d to A defines a metric space. Furthermore, the topology induced by the metric
dA agrees with the topology defined by U, as above.
Proof. Left as an exercise.
Proposition 37.5 suggests the following definition.
Definition 37.11. Given a topological space (E, O), given any subset A of E, the subspace
topology on A induced by O is the family U of open sets defined such that
U = {U ∩ A | U ∈ O}
is the family of all subsets of A obtained as the intersection of any open set in O with A.
We say that (A, U) has the subspace topology. If (E, d) is a metric space, the restriction
dA : A × A → R+ of the metric d to A is called the subspace metric.
For example, if E = R
n and d is the Euclidean metric, we obtain the subspace topology
on the closed n-cube
{(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ E | ai ≤ xi ≤ bi
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
See Figure 37.11,

One should realize that every open set U ∈ O which is entirely contained in A is also in
the family U, but U may contain open sets that are not in O. For example, if E = R
with |x−y|, and A = [a, b], then sets of the form [a, c), with a < c < b belong to U, but they
are not open sets for R under |x−y|. However, there is agreement in the following situation.
Proposition 37.6. Given a topological space (E, O), given any subset A of E, if U is the
subspace topology, then the following properties hold.
(1) If A is an open set A ∈ O, then every open set U ∈ U is an open set U ∈ O.
(2) If A is a closed set in E, then every closed set w.r.t. the subspace topology is a closed
set w.r.t. O.
Proof. Left as an exercise.
The concept of product topology is also useful. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 37.7. Given n topological spaces (Ei
, Oi), let B be the family of subsets of
E1 × · · · × En defined as follows:
B = {U1 × · · · × Un | Ui ∈ Oi
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n},
and let P be the family consisting of arbitrary unions of sets in B, including ∅. Then P is a
topology on E1 × · · · × En.

x ≤ 1, −1 ≤ y ≤ 1, −1 ≤ z ≤ 1}. The open set is the corner region ABCD and is obtained
by intersection the cube B0((1, 1, 1), 1).
Proof. Left as an exercise.
Definition 37.12. Given n topological spaces (Ei
, Oi), the product topology on E1×· · ·×En
is the family P of subsets of E1 × · · · × En defined as follows: if
B = {U1 × · · · × Un | Ui ∈ Oi
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n},
then P is the family consisting of arbitrary unions of sets in B, including ∅. See Figure 37.12.
If each (Ei

) is a metric space, there are three natural metrics that can be defined on
E1 × · · · × En:
d1((x1, . . . , xn),(y1, . . . , yn)) = dE1
(x1, y1) + · · · + dEn

It is easy to show that
d∞((x1, . . . , xn),(y1, . . . , yn)) ≤ d2((x1, . . . , xn),(y1, . . . , yn)) ≤ d1((x1, . . . , xn),(y1, . . . , yn))
≤ nd∞((x1, . . . , xn),(y1, . . . , yn)),
so these distances define the same topology, which is the product topology.
If each (Ei
, k k Ei
) is a normed vector space, there are three natural norms that can be
defined on E1 × · · · × En:

k
(x1, . . . , xn)k ∞ ≤ k(x1, . . . , xn)k 2 ≤ k(x1, . . . , xn)k 1 ≤ nk (x1, . . . , xn)k ∞,
so these norms define the same topology, which is the product topology. It can also be
verified that when Ei = R, with the standard topology induced by |x − y|, the topology
product on R
n
is the standard topology induced by the Euclidean norm.
Definition 37.13. Two metrics d and d
0 on a space E are equivalent if they induce the same
topology O on E (i.e., they define the same family O of open sets). Similarly, two norms k k
and k k 0 on a space E are equivalent if they induce the same topology O on E.
Given a topological space (E, O), it is often useful, as in Proposition 37.7, to define the
topology O in terms of a subfamily B of subsets of E.
1334 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Definition 37.14. We say that a family B of subsets of E is a basis for the topology O, if
B is a subset of O, and if every open set U in O can be obtained as some union (possibly
infinite) of sets in B (agreeing that the empty union is the empty set).
For example, given any metric space (E, d), B = {B0(a, ρ) | a ∈ E, ρ > 0}. In particular,
if d = k k 2, the open intervals form a basis for R, while the open disks form a basis for R
2
.
The open rectangles also form a basis for R
2 with the standard topology. See Figure 37.13.
It is immediately verified that if a family B = (Ui)i∈I is a basis for the topology of (E, O),
then E =
S i∈I Ui
, and the intersection of any two sets Ui
, Uj ∈ B is the union of some sets in
the family B (again, agreeing that the empty union is the empty set). Conversely, a family
B with these properties is the basis of the topology obtained by forming arbitrary unions of
sets in B.
Definition 37.15. A subbasis for O is a family S of subsets of E, such that the family B
of all finite intersections of sets in S (including E itself, in case of the empty intersection) is
a basis of O. See Figure 37.13.

The following proposition gives useful criteria for determining whether a family of open
subsets is a basis of a topological space.
Proposition 37.8. Given a topological space (E, O) and a family B of open subsets in O
the following properties hold:
(1) The family B is a basis for the topology O iff for every open set U ∈ O and every
x ∈ U, there is some B ∈ B such that x ∈ B and B ⊆ U. See Figure 37.14.

We now consider the fundamental property of continuity.

Definition 37.16. Let (E, OE) and (F, OF ) be topological spaces, and let f : E → F be a
function. For every a ∈ E, we say that f is continuous at a, if for every open set V ∈ OF
containing f(a), there is some open set U ∈ OE containing a, such that, f(U) ⊆ V . See
Figure 37.16. We say that f is continuous if it is continuous at every a ∈ E.
Define a neighborhood of a ∈ E as any subset N of E containing some open set O ∈ O
such that a ∈ O. If f is continuous at a and N is any neighborhood of f(a), there is some
open set V ⊆ N containing f(a), and since f is continuous at a, there is some open set U
containing a, such that f(U) ⊆ V . Since V ⊆ N, the open set U is a subset of f

It is easy to see that Definition 37.16 is equivalent to the following statements.
Proposition 37.9. Let (E, OE) and (F, OF ) be topological spaces, and let f : E → F be a
function. For every a ∈ E, the function f is continuous at a ∈ E iff for every neighborhood
N of f(a) ∈ F, then f

(N) is a neighborhood of a. The function f is continuous on E iff
f

(V ) is an open set in OE for every open set V ∈ OF .
If E and F are metric spaces defined by metrics dE and dF , we can show easily that f is
continuous at a iff
for every  > 0, there is some η > 0, such that, for every x ∈ E,
if dE(a, x) ≤ η, then dF (f(a), f(x)) ≤ .
Similarly, if E and F are normed vector spaces defined by norms k k E and k k F , we can
show easily that f is continuous at a iff
37.3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS, LIMITS 1337
for every  > 0, there is some η > 0, such that, for every x ∈ E,
if k x − ak E ≤ η, then k f(x) − f(a)k F ≤ .
It is worth noting that continuity is a topological notion, in the sense that equivalent
metrics (or equivalent norms) define exactly the same notion of continuity.
Definition 37.17. If (E, OE) and (F, OF ) are topological spaces, and f : E → F is a
function, for every nonempty subset A ⊆ E of E, we say that f is continuous on A if
the restriction of f to A is continuous with respect to (A, U) and (F, OF ), where U is the
subspace topology induced by OE on A.
Given a product E1×· · ·×En of topological spaces, as usual, we let πi
: E1×· · ·×En → Ei
be the projection function such that, πi(x1, . . . , xn) = xi
. It is immediately verified that each
πi
is continuous.

set in O. Then if (E, OE) and (F, OF ) are topological spaces, any function f : E → F is
