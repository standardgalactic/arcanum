= ρ, then d = a3.
Proof. Figure 24.21 illustrates the theorem of Thales. We sketch a proof, leaving the details
as an exercise. Since H1, H2, H3 are parallel, they have the same direction −→H, a hyperplane

in
−→E . Let u ∈
−→E −
−→H be any nonnull vector such that A = a1+Ru. Since A is not parallel to
H, we have −→E =
−→H ⊕Ru, and thus we can define the linear map p:
−→E → Ru, the projection
on Ru parallel to −→H. This linear map induces an affine map f : E → A, by defining f such
that
f(b1 + w) = a1 + p(w),
for all w ∈
−→E . Clearly, f(b1) = a1, and since H1, H2, H3 all have direction −→H, we also have
f(b2) = a2 and f(b3) = a3. Since f is affine, it preserves ratios, and thus
−−→a1a3
−−→a1a2
=
−−→b1b3
−−→b1b2
.
The converse is immediate.
We also have the following simple proposition, whose proof is left as an easy exercise.
Proposition 24.11. Given any affine space E, given any two distinct points a, b ∈ E, and
for any affine dilatation f different from the identity, if a
0 = f(a), D = h a, bi is the line
passing through a and b, and D0 is the line parallel to D and passing through a
0 , the following
are equivalent:
(i) b
0 = f(b);
(ii) If f is a translation, then b
0 is the intersection of D0 with the line parallel to h a, a0 i
passing through b;
If f is a dilatation of center c, then b
0 = D0 ∩ hc, bi .
The first case is the parallelogram law, and the second case follows easily from Thales’
theorem. For an illustration, see Figure 24.22.
We are now ready to prove two classical results of affine geometry, Pappus’s theorem and
Desargues’s theorem. Actually, these results are theorems of projective geometry, and we
are stating affine versions of these important results. There are stronger versions that are
best proved using projective geometry.
Proposition 24.12. Given any affine plane E, any two distinct lines D and D0 , then for
any distinct points a, b, c on D and a
0 , b0 , c0 on D0 , if a, b, c, a0 , b
0 , c
0 are distinct from the
intersection of D and D0 (if D and D0 intersect) and if the lines h a, b0 i and h a
0 , bi are parallel,
and the lines h b, c0 i and h b
0 , ci are parallel, then the lines h a, c0 i and h a
0 , ci are parallel.

Figure 24.22: An illustration of Proposition 24.11. The bottom left diagram illustrates a
translation, while the bottom right illustrates a central dilation through c.
Proof. Pappus’s theorem is illustrated in Figure 24.23. If D and D0 are not parallel, let d
be their intersection. Let f be the dilatation of center d such that f(a) = b, and let g be the
dilatation of center d such that g(b) = c. Since the lines h a, b0 i and h a
0 , bi are parallel, and
the lines h b, c0 i and h b
0 , ci are parallel, by Proposition 24.11 we have a
0 = f(b
0 ) and b
0 = g(c
0 ).
However, we observed that dilatations with the same center commute, and thus f ◦g = g ◦f,
and thus, letting h = g ◦ f, we get c = h(a) and a
0 = h(c
0 ). Again, by Proposition 24.11, the
lines h a, c0 i and h a
0 , ci are parallel. If D and D0 are parallel, we use translations instead of
dilatations.
There is a converse to Pappus’s theorem, which yields a fancier version of Pappus’s
theorem, but it is easier to prove it using projective geometry. It should be noted that
in axiomatic presentations of projective geometry, Pappus’s theorem is equivalent to the
commutativity of the ground field K (in the present case, K = R). We now prove an affine
version of Desargues’s theorem.
Proposition 24.13. Given any affine space E, and given any two triangles (a, b, c) and
(a
0 , b0 , c0 ), where a, b, c, a0 , b0 , c0 are all distinct, if h a, bi and h a
0 , b0 i are parallel and h b, ci and
are either parallel or concurrent (i.e., intersect in a common point).
h
b
0 , c0 i are parallel, then h a, ci and h a
0 , c0 i are parallel iff the lines h a, a0 i , h b, b0 i , and h c, c0 i
Proof. We prove half of the proposition, the direction in which it is assumed that h a, ci and
h
a
0 , c0 i are parallel, leaving the converse as an exercise. Since the lines h a, bi and h a
0 , b0 i are

parallel, the points a, b, a0 , b0 are coplanar. Thus, either h a, a0 i and h b, b0 i are parallel, or
they have some intersection d. We consider the second case where they intersect, leaving
the other case as an easy exercise. Let f be the dilatation of center d such that f(a) = a
0 .
By Proposition 24.11, we get f(b) = b
0 . If f(c) = c
00 , again by Proposition 24.11 twice, the
lines h b, ci and h b
0 , c00 i are parallel, and the lines h a, ci and h a
0 , c00 i are parallel. From this it
follows that c
00 = c
0 . Indeed, recall that h b, ci and h b
0 , c0 i are parallel, and similarly h a, ci and
h
a
0 , c0 i are parallel. Thus, the lines h b
0 , c00 i and h b
0 , c0 i are identical, and similarly the lines
h
a
0 , c00 i and h a
0 , c0 i are identical. Since
−→
a
0 c
0 and
−→
b
0 c
0 are linearly independent, these lines have
a unique intersection, which must be c
00 = c
0 .
The direction where it is assumed that the lines h a, a0 i , h b, b0 i and h c, c0 i , are either parallel
or concurrent is left as an exercise (in fact, the proof is quite similar).
Desargues’s theorem is illustrated in Figure 24.24.
There is a fancier version of Desargues’s theorem, but it is easier to prove it using pro￾jective geometry. It should be noted that in axiomatic presentations of projective geometry,
Desargues’s theorem is related to the associativity of the ground field K (in the present
case, K = R). Also, Desargues’s theorem yields a geometric characterization of the affine
dilatations. An affine dilatation f on an affine space E is a bijection that maps every line
D to a line f(D) parallel to D. We leave the proof as an exercise.

24.10 Affine Hyperplanes
We now consider affine forms and affine hyperplanes. In Section 24.5 we observed that the
set L of solutions of an equation
ax + by = c
is an affine subspace of A
2 of dimension 1, in fact, a line (provided that a and b are not both
null). It would be equally easy to show that the set P of solutions of an equation
ax + by + cz = d
is an affine subspace of A
3 of dimension 2, in fact, a plane (provided that a, b, c are not all
null). More generally, the set H of solutions of an equation
λ1x1 + · · · + λmxm = µ
is an affine subspace of A
m, and if λ1, . . . , λm are not all null, it turns out that it is a subspace
of dimension m − 1 called a hyperplane.
We can interpret the equation
λ1x1 + · · · + λmxm = µ
in terms of the map f : R
m → R defined such that
f(x1, . . . , xm) = λ1x1 + · · · + λmxm − µ
for all (x1, . . . , xm) ∈ R
m. It is immediately verified that this map is affine, and the set H of
solutions of the equation
λ1x1 + · · · + λmxm = µ
24.10. AFFINE HYPERPLANES 833
is the null set, or kernel, of the affine map f : A
m → R, in the sense that
H = f
−1
(0) = {x ∈ A
m | f(x) = 0},
where x = (x1, . . . , xm).
Thus, it is interesting to consider affine forms, which are just affine maps f : E → R
from an affine space to R. Unlike linear forms f
∗
, for which Ker f
∗
is never empty (since it
always contains the vector 0), it is possible that f
−1
(0) = ∅ for an affine form f. Given an
affine map f : E → R, we also denote f
−1
(0) by Ker f, and we call it the kernel of f. Recall
that an (affine) hyperplane is an affine subspace of codimension 1. The relationship between
affine hyperplanes and affine forms is given by the following proposition.
Proposition 24.14. Let E be an affine space. The following properties hold:
(a) Given any nonconstant affine form f : E → R, its kernel H = Ker f is a hyperplane.
(b) For any hyperplane H in E, there is a nonconstant affine form f : E → R such that
H = Ker f. For any other affine form g : E → R such that H = Ker g, there is some
λ ∈ R such that g = λf (with λ 6 = 0).
(c) Given any hyperplane H in E and any (nonconstant) affine form f : E → R such that
H = Ker f, every hyperplane H0 parallel to H is defined by a nonconstant affine form
g such that g(a) = f(a) − λ, for all a ∈ E and some λ ∈ R.
Proof. The proof is straightforward, and is omitted. It is also given in Gallier [70].
When E is of dimension n, given an affine frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) of E with origin
a0, recall from Definition 24.5 that every point of E can be expressed uniquely as x =
a0 + x1u1 + · · · + xnun, where (x1, . . . , xn) are the coordinates of x with respect to the affine
frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)).
Also recall that every linear form f
∗
is such that f
∗
(x) = λ1x1 + · · · + λnxn, for every
x = x1u1 + · · · + xnun and some λ1, . . . , λn ∈ R. Since an affine form f : E → R satisfies the
property f(a0 +x) = f(a0) +−→f (x), denoting f(a0 +x) by f(x1, . . . , xn), we see that we have
f(x1, . . . , xn) = λ1x1 + · · · + λnxn + µ,
where µ = f(a0) ∈ R and λ1, . . . , λn ∈ R. Thus, a hyperplane is the set of points whose
coordinates (x1, . . . , xn) satisfy the (affine) equation
λ1x1 + · · · + λnxn + µ = 0.
834 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
24.11 Intersection of Affine Spaces
In this section we take a closer look at the intersection of affine subspaces. This subsection
can be omitted at first reading.
First, we need a result of linear algebra. Given a vector space E and any two subspaces M
and N, there are several interesting linear maps. We have the canonical injections i: M →
M +N and j : N → M +N, the canonical injections in1 : M → M ⊕N and in2 : N → M ⊕N,
and thus, injections f : M ∩N → M ⊕N and g : M ∩N → M ⊕N, where f is the composition
of the inclusion map from M ∩ N to M with in1, and g is the composition of the inclusion
map from M ∩ N to N with in2. Then, we have the maps f + g : M ∩ N → M ⊕ N, and
i − j : M ⊕ N → M + N.
Proposition 24.15. Given a vector space E and any two subspaces M and N, with the
definitions above,
0 −→ M ∩ N −→
f+g M ⊕ N
i−
−→
j M + N −→ 0
is a short exact sequence, which means that f + g is injective, i − j is surjective, and that
Im (f + g) = Ker (i − j). As a consequence, we have the Grassmann relation
dim(M) + dim(N) = dim(M + N) + dim (M ∩ N).
Proof. It is obvious that i − j is surjective and that f + g is injective. Assume that (i −
j)(u + v) = 0, where u ∈ M, and v ∈ N. Then, i(u) = j(v), and thus, by definition of i and
j, there is some w ∈ M ∩ N, such that i(u) = j(v) = w ∈ M ∩ N. By definition of f and g,
u = f(w) and v = g(w), and thus Im (f + g) = Ker (i − j), as desired. The second part of
the proposition follows from standard results of linear algebra (see Artin [7], Strang [170],
or Lang [109]).
We now prove a simple proposition about the intersection of affine subspaces.
Proposition 24.16. Given any affine space E, for any two nonempty affine subspaces M
and N, the following facts hold:
(1) M ∩ N 6 = ∅ iff −→ab ∈
−→M +
−→N for some a ∈ M and some b ∈ N.
(2) M ∩ N consists of a single point iff −→ab ∈
−→M +
−→N for some a ∈ M and some b ∈ N,
and −→M ∩
−→N = {0}.
(3) If S is the least affine subspace containing M and N, then −→S =
−→M +
−→N + K
−→ab (the
vector space
−→E is defined over the field K).
24.11. INTERSECTION OF AFFINE SPACES 835
Proof. (1) Pick any a ∈ M and any b ∈ N, which is possible, since M and N are nonempty.
Since −→M = {
−→ax | x ∈ M} and −→N = {
−→by | y ∈ N}, if M ∩ N 6 = ∅, for any c ∈ M ∩ N we have
−→ab =
−→ac −
−→bc, with −→ac ∈
−→M and
−→bc ∈
−→N , and thus,
−→ab ∈
−→M +
−→N . Conversely, assume that
−→ab ∈
−→M +
−→N for some a ∈ M and some b ∈ N. Then
−→ab =
−→ax +
−→by, for some x ∈ M and
some y ∈ N. But we also have
−→ab =
−→ax +
−→xy +
−→yb,
and thus we get 0 = −→xy +
−→yb −
−→by, that is, −→xy = 2
−→by. Thus, b is the middle of the segment
[x, y], and since −→yx = 2
−→yb, x = 2b − y is the barycenter of the weighted points (b, 2) and
(y, −1). Thus x also belongs to N, since N being an affine subspace, it is closed under
barycenters. Thus, x ∈ M ∩ N, and M ∩ N 6 = ∅.
(2) Note that in general, if M ∩ N 6 = ∅, then
−−−−→ M ∩ N =
−→M ∩
−→N ,
because
−−−−→ M ∩ N = {
−→ab | a, b ∈ M ∩ N} = {
−→ab | a, b ∈ M} ∩ {−→ab | a, b ∈ N} =
−→M ∩
−→N .
Since M ∩ N = c +
−−−−→ M ∩ N for any c ∈ M ∩ N, we have
M ∩ N = c +
−→M ∩
−→N for any c ∈ M ∩ N.
From this it follows that if M ∩N 6 = ∅, then M ∩N consists of a single point iff −→M ∩
−→N = {0}.
This fact together with what we proved in (1) proves (2).
(3) This is left as an easy exercise.
Remarks:
(1) The proof of Proposition 24.16 shows that if M ∩ N 6 = ∅, then
−→ab ∈
−→M +
−→N for all
a ∈ M and all b ∈ N.
(2) Proposition 24.16 implies that for any two nonempty affine subspaces M and N, if
−→E =
−→M ⊕
−→N , then M ∩ N consists of a single point. Indeed, if −→E =
−→M ⊕
−→N , then
−→ab ∈
−→E for all a ∈ M and all b ∈ N, and since −→M ∩
−→N = {0}, the result follows from
part (2) of the proposition.
We can now state the following proposition.
Proposition 24.17. Given an affine space E and any two nonempty affine subspaces M
and N, if S is the least affine subspace containing M and N, then the following properties
hold:
836 CHAPTER 24. BASICS OF AFFINE GEOMETRY
(1) If M ∩ N = ∅, then
dim(M) + dim(N) < dim(E) + dim(−→M +
−→N )
and
dim(S) = dim(M) + dim(N) + 1 − dim(−→M ∩
−→N ).
(2) If M ∩ N 6 = ∅, then
dim(S) = dim(M) + dim(N) − dim(M ∩ N).
Proof. The proof is not difficult, using Proposition 24.16 and Proposition 24.15, but we leave
it as an exercise.
Chapter 25
Embedding an Affine Space in a
Vector Space
25.1 The “Hat Construction,” or Homogenizing
For all practical purposes, most geometric objects, including curves and surfaces, live in affine
spaces. A disadvantage of the affine world is that points and vectors live in disjoint universes.
It is often more convenient, at least mathematically, to deal with linear objects (vector
spaces, linear combinations, linear maps), rather than affine objects (affine spaces, affine
combinations, affine maps). Actually, it would also be advantageous if we could manipulate
points and vectors as if they lived in a common universe, using perhaps an extra bit of
information to distinguish between them if necessary.
Such a “homogenization” (or “hat construction”) can be achieved. As a matter of fact,
such a homogenization of an affine space and its associated vector space will be very useful
to define and manipulate rational curves and surfaces. Indeed, the hat construction yields a
canonical construction of the projective completion of an affine space. It also leads to a very
elegant method for obtaining the various formulae giving the derivatives of a polynomial
curve, or the directional derivatives of polynomial surfaces. However, these formulae are not
needed here. Thus we omit this topic, referring the readers to Gallier [70].
This chapter proceeds as follows. First, the construction of a vector space Eb in which
both E and −→E are embedded as (affine) hyperplanes is described. It is shown how affine
frames in E become bases in Eb. It turns out that Eb is characterized by a universality
property: Affine maps to vector spaces extend uniquely to linear maps. As a consequence,
affine maps between affine spaces E and F extend to linear maps between Eb and Fb.
Let us first explain how to distinguish between points and vectors practically, using what
amounts to a “hacking trick.” Then, we will show that such a procedure can be put on firm
mathematical grounds.
Assume that we consider the real affine space E of dimension 3, and that we have some
837
838 CHAPTER 25. EMBEDDING AN AFFINE SPACE IN A VECTOR SPACE
affine frame (a0,(v1, v2, v2)). With respect to this affine frame, every point x ∈ E is repre￾sented by its coordinates (x1, x2, x3), where a = a0 + x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3. A vector u ∈
−→E is
also represented by its coordinates (u1, u2, u3) over the basis (v1, v2, v2). One way to distin￾guish between points and vectors is to add a fourth coordinate, and to agree that points are
represented by (row) vectors (x1, x2, x3, 1) whose fourth coordinate is 1, and that vectors are
represented by (row) vectors (v1, v2, v3, 0) whose fourth coordinate is 0. This “programming
trick” actually works very well. Of course, we are opening the door for strange elements such
as (x1, x2, x3, 5), where the fourth coordinate is neither 1 nor 0.
The question is, can we make sense of such elements, and of such a construction? The
answer is yes. We will present a construction in which an affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 is embedded
in a vector space b E, in which −→E is embedded as a hyperplane passing through the origin,
and E itself is embedded as an affine hyperplane, defined as ω
−1
(1), for some linear form
ω: b E → R. In the case of an affine space E of dimension 2, we can think of b E as the vector
space R
3 of dimension 3 in which −→E corresponds to the xy-plane, and E corresponds to the
plane of equation z = 1, parallel to the xy-plane and passing through the point on the z-axis
of coordinates (0, 0, 1). The construction of the vector space Eb is presented in some detail
in Berger [11]. Berger explains the construction in terms of vector fields. We prefer a more
geometric and simpler description in terms of simple geometric transformations, translations,
and dilatations.
Remark: Readers with a good knowledge of geometry will recognize the first step in embed￾ding an affine space into a projective space. We will also show that the homogenization b E of
an affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 , satisfies a universal property with respect to the extension of affine
maps to linear maps. As a consequence, the vector space b E is unique up to isomorphism,
and its actual construction is not so important. However, it is quite useful to visualize the
space Eb, in order to understand well rational curves and rational surfaces.
As usual, for simplicity, it is assumed that all vector spaces are defined over the field R of
real numbers, and that all families of scalars (points and vectors) are finite. The extension
to arbitrary fields and to families of finite support is immediate. We begin by defining
two very simple kinds of geometric (affine) transformations. Given an affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 ,
every u ∈
−→E induces a mapping tu : E → E, called a translation, and defined such that
tu(a) = a+u for every a ∈ E. Clearly, the set of translations is a vector space isomorphic to
−→E . Thus, we will use the same notation u for both the vector u and the translation tu. Given
any point a and any scalar λ ∈ R, we define the mapping Ha,λ : E → E, called dilatation (or
central dilatation, or homothety) of center a and ratio λ, and defined such that
Ha,λ(x) = a + λ
−→ax,
for every x ∈ E. We have Ha,λ(a) = a, and when λ 6 = 0 and x 6 = a, Ha,λ(x) is on the line
defined by a and x, and is obtained by “scaling” −→ax by λ. The effect is a uniform dilatation
25.1. THE “HAT CONSTRUCTION,” OR HOMOGENIZING 839
(or contraction, if λ < 1). When λ = 0, Ha,0(x) = a for all x ∈ E, and Ha,0 is the constant
affine map sending every point to a. If we assume λ 6 = 1, note that Ha,λ is never the identity,
and since a is a fixed point, Ha,λ is never a translation.
We now consider the set Eb of geometric transformations from E to E, consisting of the
union of the (disjoint) sets of translations and dilatations of ratio λ 6 = 1. We would like
to give this set the structure of a vector space, in such a way that both E and −→E can be
naturally embedded into Eb. In fact, it will turn out that barycenters show up quite naturally
too!
In order to “add” two dilatations Ha1,λ1 and Ha2,λ2
, it turns out that it is more convenient
to consider dilatations of the form Ha,1−λ, where λ 6 = 0. To see this, let us see the effect of
such a dilatation on a point x ∈ E: We have
Ha,1−λ(x) = a + (1 − λ)
−→ax = a +
−→ax − λ
−→ax = x + λ
−→xa.
For simplicity of notation, let us denote Ha,1−λ by h a, λi . Then, we have
h
a, λi (x) = x + λ
−→xa.
Remarks:
(1) Note that Ha,1−λ(x) = Hx,λ(a).
(2) Berger defines a map h: E →
−→E as a vector field. Thus, each h a, λi can be viewed
as the vector field x 7→ λ
−→xa. Similarly, a translation u can be viewed as the constant
vector field x 7→ u. Thus, we could define b E as the (disjoint) union of these two vector
fields. We prefer our view in terms of geometric transformations.
Then, since
h
a1, λ1i (x) = x + λ1
−→xa1 and h a2, λ2i (x) = x + λ2
−→xa2,
if we want to define h a1, λ1i +b h a2, λ2i , we see that we have to distinguish between two cases:
(1) λ1 + λ2 = 0. In this case, since
λ1
−→xa1 + λ2
−→xa2 = λ1
−→xa1 − λ1
−→xa2 = λ1
−−→a2a1,
we let
h
a1, λ1i +b h a2, λ2i = λ1
−−→a2a1,
where λ1
−−→a2a1 denotes the translation associated with the vector λ1
−−→a2a1.
(2) λ1 + λ2 6 = 0. In this case, the points a1 and a2 assigned the weights λ1/(λ1 + λ2) and
λ2/(λ1 + λ2) have a barycenter

−→xa + λ
−1u),
and so, letting b = a + λ
−1u, since
−→ab = λ
−1u, we have
λ
−→xa + u = λ(
−→xa + λ
−1u) = λ(
−→xa +
−→ab) = λ
−→xb,
and we let
h
a, λi +b u = h a + λ
−1u, λi ,
the dilatation of center a + λ
−1u and ratio λ.
The sum of two translations u and v is of course defined as the translation u + v. It is
also natural to define multiplication by a scalar as follows:
µ · ha, λi = h a, λµi ,
and
λ · u = λu,
where λu is the product by a scalar in −→E .
We can now use the definition of the above operations to state the following proposition,
showing that the “hat construction” described above has allowed us to achieve our goal of
embedding both E and −→E in the vector space Eb.
Proposition 25.1. The set Eb consisting of the disjoint union of the translations and the
dilatations Ha,1−λ = h a, λi , λ ∈ R, λ 6 = 0, is a vector space under the following operations of
addition and multiplication by a scalar: If λ1 + λ2 = 0, then
h
a1, λ1i +b h a2, λ2i = λ1
−−→a2a1;
if λ1 + λ2 6 = 0, then
h
a1, λ1i +b h a2, λ2i =

λ1
λ1 + λ2
a1 +
λ2
λ1 + λ2
a2, λ1 + λ2
 ,
h
a, λi +b u = u +b h a, λi = h a + λ
−1u, λi ,
u +b v = u + v;
25.1. THE “HAT CONSTRUCTION,” OR HOMOGENIZING 841
if µ 6 = 0, then
µ · ha, λi = h a, λµi ,
0 · ha, λi = 0;
and
λ · u = λu.
Furthermore, the map ω: Eb → R defined such that
ω(h a, λi ) = λ,
ω(u) = 0,
is a linear form, ω
−1
(0) is a hyperplane isomorphic to −→E under the injective linear map
i:
−→E → b E such that i(u) = tu (the translation associated with u), and ω
−1
(1) is an affine
hyperplane isomorphic to E with direction i(
−→E ), under the injective affine map j : E → b E,
where j(a) = h a, 1i for every a ∈ E. Finally, for every a ∈ E, we have
Eb = i
￾
−→E
 ⊕ Rj(a).
Proof. The verification that Eb is a vector space is straightforward. The linear map mapping
a vector u to the translation defined by u is clearly an injection i:
−→E → b E embedding −→E as
an hyperplane in Eb. It is also clear that ω is a linear form. Note that
j(a + u) = h a + u, 1i = h a, 1i +b u,
where u stands for the translation associated with the vector u, and thus j is an affine injec￾tion with associated linear map i. Thus, ω
−1
(1) is indeed an affine hyperplane isomorphic
to E with direction i
￾
−→E
 , under the map j : E → Eb. Finally, from the definition of + , for b
every a ∈ E and every u ∈
−→E , since
i(u) +b λ · j(a) = u +b h a, λi = h a + λ
−1u, λi ,
when λ 6 = 0, we get any arbitrary v ∈ b E by picking λ = 0 and u = v, and we get any
arbitrary element h b, µi , µ 6 = 0, by picking λ = µ and u = µ
−→ab. Thus,
Eb = i
￾
−→E
 + Rj(a),
and since i
￾
−→E
 ∩ Rj(a) = {0}, we have
Eb = i
￾
−→E
 ⊕ Rj(a),
for every a ∈ E.

Figure 25.1: Embedding an affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 into a vector space Eb.
Figure 25.1 illustrates the embedding of the affine space E into the vector space Eb, when
E is an affine plane.
Note that Eb is isomorphic to −→E ∪ (E × R
∗
). Intuitively, we can think of Eb as a stack of
parallel hyperplanes, one for each λ, a little bit like an infinite stack of very thin pancakes!
There are two privileged pancakes: one corresponding to E, for λ = 1, and one corresponding
to
−→E , for λ = 0.
From now on, we will identify j(E) and E, and i
￾
−→E
 and −→E . We will also write λa
instead of h a, λi , which we will call a weighted point, and write 1a just as a. When we
want to be more precise, we may also write h a, 1i as a. In particular, when we consider the
homogenized version Ab of the affine space A associated with the field R considered as an
affine space, we write λ for h λ, 1i , when viewing λ as a point in both A and Ab, and simply
λ, when viewing λ as a vector in R and in Ab. As an example, the expression 2 + 3 denotes
the real number 5, in A, (2 + 3)/2 denotes the midpoint of the segment  2, 3
 , which can be
denoted by 2.5, and 2+3 does not make sense in A, since it is not a barycentric combination.
However, in b A, the expression 2 + 3 makes sense: It is the weighted point 
 2.5, 2
 .
Then, in view of the fact that
h
a + u, 1i = h a, 1i +b u,
and since we are identifying a + u with h a + u, 1i (under the injection j), in the simplified
notation the above reads as a + u = a +b u. Thus, we go one step further, and denote a +b u
25.1. THE “HAT CONSTRUCTION,” OR HOMOGENIZING 843
by a + u. However, since
h
a, λi +b u = h a + λ
−1u, λi ,
we will refrain from writing λa b + u as λa + u, because we find it too confusing. From
Proposition 25.1, for every a ∈ E, every element of Eb can be written uniquely as u +b λa.
We also denote
λa + ( b−µ)b
by
λa −b µb.
We can now justify rigorously the programming trick of the introduction of an extra
coordinate to distinguish between points and vectors. First, we make a few observations.
Given any family (ai)i∈I of points in E, and any family (λi)i∈I of scalars in R, it is easily
shown by induction on the size of I that the following holds:
(1) If P i∈I
λi = 0, then
X
i∈I
h
ai
, λii =
−−−−−→
X
i∈I
λiai

where −−−−−→
X

λiai =

for any b ∈ E, which, by Proposition 24.1, is a vector independent of b, or

λi 6 = 0, then
X

*
X
i∈I
λi
P

.
Thus, we see how barycenters reenter the scene quite naturally, and that in Eb, we can
make sense of P i∈I
h
ai
, λii
, regardless of the value of P i∈I
λi
. When P i∈I
λi = 1, the element
P
i∈I
h
ai
, λii belongs to the hyperplane ω
−1
(1), and thus it is a point. When P i∈I
λi = 0,
the linear combination of points P i∈I
λiai
is a vector, and when I = {1, . . . , n}, we allow
ourselves to write
λ1a1 +b · · · +b λnan,
where some of the occurrences of + can be replaced by b −b , as
λ1a1 + · · · + λnan,
where the occurrences of −b (if any) are replaced by −.
In fact, we have the following slightly more general property, which is left as an exercise.

Proof. By induction on the size of I and the size of J.
The above formulae show that we have some kind of extended barycentric calculus.
Operations on weighted points and vectors were introduced by H. Grassmann, in his book
published in 1844! This calculus will be helpful in dealing with rational curves.
25.2 Affine Frames of E and Bases of Eb
There is also a nice relationship between affine frames in ￾ E,
−→E
 and bases of Eb, stated in
the following proposition.
Proposition 25.3. Given any affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 , for any affine frame (a0, (
−−→a0a1, . . .,
−−→a0am)) for E, the family (
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am, a0) is a basis for Eb, and for any affine frame
(a0, . . . , am) for E, the family (a0, . . . , am) is a basis for Eb. Furthermore, given any element
h
x, λi ∈ Eb, if
x = a0 + x1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + xm
−−→a0am
over the affine frame (a0,(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am)) in E, then the coordinates of h x, λi over the basis
(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am, a0) in Eb are
(λx1, . . . , λxm, λ).
For any vector v ∈
−→E , if
v = v1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + vm
−−→a0am
25.2. AFFINE FRAMES OF E AND BASES OF Eˆ 845
over the basis (
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) in
−→E , then over the basis (
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am, a0) in Eb, the
coordinates of v are
(v1, . . . , vm, 0).
For any element h a, λi , where λ 6 = 0, if the barycentric coordinates of a w.r.t. the affine
basis (a0, . . . , am) in E are (λ0, . . . , λm) with λ0 +· · ·+λm = 1, then the coordinates of h a, λi
w.r.t. the basis (a0, . . . , am) in Eb are
(λλ0, . . . , λλm).
If a vector v ∈
−→E is expressed as
v = v1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + vm
−−→a0am = −(v1 + · · · + vm)a0 + v1a1 + · · · + vmam,
with respect to the affine basis (a0, . . . , am) in E, then its coordinates w.r.t. the basis
(a0, . . . , am) in Eb are
(−(v1 + · · · + vm), v1, . . . , vm).
Proof. We sketch parts of the proof, leaving the details as an exercise. Figure 25.2 shows
the basis (−−→a0a1,
−−→a0a2, a0) corresponding to the affine frame (a0, a1, a2) in E.

If we assume that we have a nontrivial linear combination
λ1
−−→a0a1 +b · · · +b λm
−−→a0am +b µa0 = 0,
if µ 6 = 0, then we have

which is never null, and thus, µ = 0, but since (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) is a basis of −→E , we must also
have λi = 0 for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Given any element h x, λi ∈ Eb, if
x = a0 + x1
−−→a0a1 + · · · + xm
−−→a0am
over the affine frame (a0,(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am)) in E, in view of the definition of + , we have b

−−→a0am, λi
= h a0, λi +b λx1
−−→a0a1 +b · · · +b λxm
−−→a0am,
which shows that over the basis (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am, a0) in Eb, the coordinates of h x, λi are
(λx1, . . . , λxm, λ).
If (x1, . . . , xm) are the coordinates of x w.r.t. the affine frame (a0,(
−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am)) in
E, then (x1, . . . , xm, 1) are the coordinates of x in Eb, i.e., the last coordinate is 1, and if
u has coordinates (u1, . . . , um) with respect to the basis (−−→a0a1, . . . ,
−−→a0am) in −→E , then u has
coordinates (u1, . . . , um, 0) in Eb, i.e., the last coordinate is 0. Figure 25.3 shows the affine
frame (a0, a1, a2) in E viewed as a basis in Eb.

25.3. ANOTHER CONSTRUCTION OF Eˆ 847
Now that we have defined Eb and investigated the relationship between affine frames in
E and bases in Eb, we can give another construction of a vector space F from E and −→E that
will allow us to “visualize” in a much more intuitive fashion the structure of b E and of its
operations + and b ·.
25.3 Another Construction of Eb
One would probably wish that we could start with this construction of F first, and then
define b E using the isomorphism b Ω: b E → F defined below. Unfortunately, we first need the
vector space structure on b E to show that b Ω is linear!
Definition 25.1. Given any affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 , we define the vector space F as the direct
sum
−→E ⊕R, where R denotes the field R considered as a vector space (over itself). Denoting
the unit vector in R by 1, since F =
−→E ⊕R, every vector v ∈ F can be written as v = u+λ1,
for some unique u ∈
−→E and some unique λ ∈ R. Then, for any choice of an origin Ω1 in E,
we define the map b Ω: b E → F, as follows:
Ω( bθ) =  λ
u
(1 + −−→Ω1a) if
if θ

=
u
h
a, λ
, where

, where
u ∈

.
E and λ 6 = 0;
The idea is that, once again, viewing F as an affine space under its canonical structure,
E is embedded in F as the hyperplane H = 1 +
−→E , with direction −→E , the hyperplane −→E in
F. Then, every point a ∈ E is in bijection with the point A = 1 +
−−→Ω1a, in the hyperplane
H. If we denote the origin 0 of the canonical affine space F by Ω, the map b Ω maps a point
h
a, λi ∈ E to a point in F, as follows: b Ω(h a, λi ) is the point on the line passing through both
