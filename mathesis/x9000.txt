continuous at every isolated point a ∈ E. In the discrete topology, every point is isolated.
In a nontrivial normed vector space (E, k k ) (with E 6 = {0}), no point is isolated. To
show this, we show that every open ball B0(u, ρ,) contains some vectors different from u.
Indeed, since E is nontrivial, there is some v ∈ E such that v 6 = 0, and thus λ = k vk > 0
(by (N1)). Let
w = u +

v.
Since v 6 = 0 and ρ > 0, we have w 6 = u. Then,

which shows that k w − uk < ρ, for w 6 = u.
The following proposition is easily shown.
Proposition 37.10. Given topological spaces (E, OE), (F, OF ), and (G, OG), and two func￾tions f : E → F and g : F → G, if f is continuous at a ∈ E and g is continuous at f(a) ∈ F,
then g ◦ f : E → G is continuous at a ∈ E. Given n topological spaces (Fi
, Oi), for every
function f : E → F1 × · · · × Fn, then f is continuous at a ∈ E iff every fi
: E → Fi is
continuous at a, where fi = πi ◦ f.
One can also show that in a metric space (E, d), the distance d: E×E → R is continuous,
where E × E has the product topology. By the triangle inequality, we have
d(x, y) ≤ d(x, x0) + d(x0, y0) + d(y0, y) = d(x0, y0) + d(x0, x) + d(y0, y)
1338 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
and
d(x0, y0) ≤ d(x0, x) + d(x, y) + d(y, y0) = d(x, y) + d(x0, x) + d(y0, y).
Consequently,
|d(x, y) − d(x0, y0)| ≤ d(x0, x) + d(y0, y),
which proves that d is continuous at (x0, y0). In fact this shows that d is uniformly continuous;
see Definition 37.36.
Given any nonempty subset A of E, by Proposition 37.2, the map x 7→ d(x, A) is contin￾uous (in fact, uniformy continuous).
Similarly, for a normed vector space (E, k k ), the norm k k : E → R is (uniformly)
continuous.
Given a function f : E1 × · · · × En → F, we can fix n − 1 of the arguments, say
a1, . . . , ai−1, ai+1, . . . , an, and view f as a function of the remaining argument,
xi
7→ f(a1, . . . , ai−1, xi
, ai+1, . . . , an),
where xi ∈ Ei
. If f is continuous, it is clear that each fi
is continuous.

One should be careful that the converse is false! For example, consider the function
f : R × R → R, defined such that,
f(x, y) = xy
x
2 + y
2
if (x, y) 6 = (0, 0), and f(0, 0) = 0.
The function f is continuous on R × R − {(0, 0)}, but on the line y = mx, with m 6 = 0, we
have f(x, y) = 1+
m
m2 6 = 0, and thus, on this line, f(x, y) does not approach 0 when (x, y)
approaches (0, 0). See Figure 37.18.

The following proposition is useful for showing that real-valued functions are continuous.
37.3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS, LIMITS 1339
Proposition 37.11. If E is a topological space, and (R, |x−y|) the reals under the standard
topology, for any two functions f : E → R and g : E → R, for any a ∈ E, for any λ ∈ R, if
f and g are continuous at a, then f +g, λf, f ·g, are continuous at a, and f/g is continuous
at a if g(a) 6 = 0.
Proof. Left as an exercise.
Using Proposition 37.11, we can show easily that every real polynomial function is con￾tinuous.
The notion of isomorphism of topological spaces is defined as follows.
Definition 37.18. Let (E, OE) and (F, OF ) be topological spaces, and let f : E → F be a
function. We say that f is a homeomorphism between E and F if f is bijective, and both
f : E → F and f
−1
: F → E are continuous.

One should be careful that a bijective continuous function f : E → F is not necessarily
a homeomorphism. For example, if E = R with the discrete topology, and F = R with
the standard topology, the identity is not a homeomorphism. Another interesting example
involving a parametric curve is given below. Let L: R → R
2 be the function, defined such
that,
L1(t) = t(1 + t
2
)
1 + t
4
,
L2(t) = t(1 − t
2
)
1 + t
4
.
If we think of (x(t), y(t)) = (L1(t), L2(t)) as a geometric point in R
2
, the set of points
(x(t), y(t)) obtained by letting t vary in R from −∞ to +∞, defines a curve having the shape
of a “figure eight,” with self-intersection at the origin, called the “lemniscate of Bernoulli.”
See Figure 37.19. The map L is continuous, and in fact bijective, but its inverse L
−1
is not
continuous. Indeed, when we approach the origin on the branch of the curve in the upper left
quadrant (i.e., points such that, x ≤ 0, y ≥ 0), then t goes to −∞, and when we approach
the origin on the branch of the curve in the lower right quadrant (i.e., points such that,
x ≥ 0, y ≤ 0), then t goes to +∞.

We also review the concept of limit of a sequence. Given any set E, a sequence is any
function x: N → E, usually denoted by (xn)n∈N, or (xn)n≥0, or even by (xn).
Definition 37.19. Given a topological space (E, O), we say that a sequence (xn)n∈N con￾verges to some a ∈ E if for every open set U containing a, there is some n0 ≥ 0, such that,
xn ∈ U, for all n ≥ n0. We also say that a is a limit of (xn)n∈N. See Figure 37.20.

When E is a metric space with metric d, it is easy to show that this is equivalent to the
fact that,
for every  > 0, there is some n0 ≥ 0, such that, d(xn, a) ≤  , for all n ≥ n0.
When E is a normed vector space with norm k k , it is easy to show that this is equivalent
to the fact that,
for every  > 0, there is some n0 ≥ 0, such that, k xn − ak ≤  , for all n ≥ n0.
The following proposition shows the importance of the Hausdorff separation axiom.
Proposition 37.12. Given a topological space (E, O), if the Hausdorff separation axiom
holds, then every sequence has at most one limit.
Proof. Left as an exercise.
It is worth noting that the notion of limit is topological, in the sense that a sequence
converge to a limit b iff it converges to the same limit b in any equivalent metric (and similarly
for equivalent norms).
If E is a metric space and if A is a subset of E, there is a convenient way of showing that
a point x ∈ E belongs to the closure A of A in terms of sequences.
Proposition 37.13. Given any metric space (E, d), for any subset A of E and any point
x ∈ E, we have x ∈ A iff there is a sequence (an) of points an ∈ A converging to x.
37.3. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS, LIMITS 1341
Proof. If the sequence (an) of points an ∈ A converges to x, then for every open subset U
of E containing x, there is some n0 such that an ∈ U for all n ≥ n0, so U ∩ A 6 = ∅, and
Proposition 37.4 implies that x ∈ A.
Conversely, assume that x ∈ A. Then for every n ≥ 1, consider the open ball B0(x, 1/n).
By Proposition 37.4, we have B0(x, 1/n) ∩ A 6 = ∅, so we can pick some an ∈ B0(x, 1/n) ∩ A.
This, way, we define a sequence (an) of points in A, and by construction d(x, an) < 1/n for
all n ≥ 1, so the sequence (an) converges to x.
We still need one more concept of limit for functions.
Definition 37.20. Let (E, OE) and (F, OF ) be topological spaces, let A be some nonempty
subset of E, and let f : A → F be a function. For any a ∈ A and any b ∈ F, we say that f(x)
approaches b as x approaches a with values in A if for every open set V ∈ OF containing b,
there is some open set U ∈ OE containing a, such that, f(U ∩ A) ⊆ V . See Figure 37.21.
This is denoted by

First, note that by Proposition 37.4, since a ∈ A, for every open set U containing a, we
have U ∩ A 6 = ∅, and the definition is nontrivial. Also, even if a ∈ A, the value f(a) of f at
a plays no role in this definition. When E and F are metric space with metrics dE and dF ,
it can be shown easily that the definition can be stated as follows:
For every  > 0, there is some η > 0, such that, for every x ∈ A,
if dE(x, a) ≤ η, then dF (f(x), b) ≤ .
When E and F are normed vector spaces with norms k k E and k k F , it can be shown
easily that the definition can be stated as follows:
1342 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
For every  > 0, there is some η > 0, such that, for every x ∈ A,
if k x − ak E ≤ η, then k f(x) − bk F ≤ .
We have the following result relating continuity at a point and the previous notion.
Proposition 37.14. Let (E, OE) and (F, OF ) be two topological spaces, and let f : E → F
be a function. For any a ∈ E, the function f is continuous at a iff f(x) approaches f(a)
when x approaches a (with values in E).
Proof. Left as a trivial exercise.
Another important proposition relating the notion of convergence of a sequence to con￾tinuity, is stated without proof.
Proposition 37.15. Let (E, OE) and (F, OF ) be two topological spaces, and let f : E → F
be a function.
(1) If f is continuous, then for every sequence (xn)n∈N in E, if (xn) converges to a, then
(f(xn)) converges to f(a).
(2) If E is a metric space, and (f(xn)) converges to f(a) whenever (xn) converges to a,
for every sequence (xn)n∈N in E, then f is continuous.
A special case of Definition 37.20 will be used when E and F are (nontrivial) normed
vector spaces with norms k k E and k k F . Let U be any nonempty open subset of E. We
showed earlier that E has no isolated points and that every set {v} is closed, for every v ∈ E.
Since E is nontrivial, for every v ∈ U, there is a nontrivial open ball contained in U (an open
ball not reduced to its center). Then, for every v ∈ U, A = U − {v} is open and nonempty,
and clearly, v ∈ A. For any v ∈ U, if f(x) approaches b when x approaches v with values
in A = U − {v}, we say that f(x) approaches b when x approaches v with values 6 = v in U.
This is denoted by
lim
x→v,x∈U,x6=v
f(x) = b.
Remark: Variations of the above case show up in the following case: E = R, and F is some
arbitrary topological space. Let A be some nonempty subset of R, and let f : A → F be
some function. For any a ∈ A, we say that f is continuous on the right at a if
lim
x→a,x∈A∩[a, +∞)
f(x) = f(a).
We can define continuity on the left at a in a similar fashion.
Let us consider another variation. Let A be some nonempty subset of R, and let f : A → F
be some function. For any a ∈ A, we say that f has a discontinuity of the first kind at a if
lim
x→a,x∈A∩ (−∞,a)
f(x) = f(a−)
37.4. CONNECTED SETS 1343
and
lim
x→a,x∈A∩ (a, +∞)
f(x) = f(a+)
both exist, and either f(a−) 6 = f(a), or f(a+) 6 = f(a).
Note that it is possible that f(a−) = f(a+), but f is still discontinuous at a if this
common value differs from f(a). Functions defined on a nonempty subset of R, and that are
continuous, except for some points of discontinuity of the first kind, play an important role
in analysis.
We now turn to connectivity properties of topological spaces.
37.4 Connected Sets
Connectivity properties of topological spaces play a very important role in understanding
the topology of surfaces. This section gathers the facts needed to have a good understanding
of the classification theorem for compact surfaces (with boundary). The main references are
Ahlfors and Sario [2] and Massey [121, 122]. For general background on topology, geometry,
and algebraic topology, we also highly recommend Bredon [30] and Fulton [67].
Definition 37.21. A topological space (E, O) is connected if the only subsets of E that are
both open and closed are the empty set and E itself. Equivalently, (E, O) is connected if E
cannot be written as the union E = U ∪ V of two disjoint nonempty open sets U, V , or if E
cannot be written as the union E = U ∪ V of two disjoint nonempty closed sets. A subset,
S ⊆ E, is connected if it is connected in the subspace topology on S induced by (E, O). See
Figure 37.22. A connected open set is called a region and a closed set is a closed region if
its interior is a connected (open) set.
The definition of connectivity is meant to capture the fact that a connected space S is “one
piece.” Given the metric space (R
n
, k k 2), the quintessential examples of connected spaces
are B0(a, ρ) and B(a, ρ). In particular, the following standard proposition characterizing the
connected subsets of R can be found in most topology texts (for example, Munkres [131],
Schwartz [150]). For the sake of completeness, we give a proof.
Proposition 37.16. A subset of the real line, R, is connected iff it is an interval, i.e., of
the form [a, b], (a, b], where a = −∞ is possible, [a, b), where b = +∞ is possible, or (a, b),
where a = −∞ or b = +∞ is possible.
Proof. Assume that A is a connected nonempty subset of R. The cases where A = ∅ or A
consists of a single point are trivial. Otherwise, we show that whenever a, b ∈ A, a < b, then
the entire interval [a, b] is a subset of A. Indeed, if this was not the case, there would be some
c ∈ (a, b) such that c /∈ A, and then we could write A = ((−∞, c)∩A)∪((c, +∞)∩A), where
(−∞, c) ∩ A and (c, +∞) ∩ A are nonempty and disjoint open subsets of A, contradicting
the fact that A is connected. It follows easily that A must be an interval.

Figure 37.22: Figure (i) shows that the union of two disjoint disks in R
2
is a disconnected
set since each circle can be separated by open half regions. Figure (ii) is an example of a
connected subset of R
2
since the two disks can not separated by open sets.
Conversely, we show that an interval, I, must be connected. Let A be any nonempty
subset of I which is both open and closed in I. We show that I = A. Fix any x ∈ A
and consider the set, Rx, of all y such that [x, y] ⊆ A. If the set Rx is unbounded, then
Rx = [x, +∞). Otherwise, if this set is bounded, let b be its least upper bound. We
claim that b is the right boundary of the interval I. Because A is closed in I, unless I
is open on the right and b is its right boundary, we must have b ∈ A. In the first case,
A ∩ [x, b) = I ∩ [x, b) = [x, b). In the second case, because A is also open in I, unless b is the
right boundary of the interval I (closed on the right), there is some open set (b − η, b + η)
contained in A, which implies that [x, b + η/2] ⊆ A, contradicting the fact that b is the least
upper bound of the set Rx. Thus, b must be the right boundary of the interval I (closed on
the right). A similar argument applies to the set, Ly, of all x such that [x, y] ⊆ A and either
Ly is unbounded, or its greatest lower bound a is the left boundary of I (open or closed on
the left). In all cases, we showed that A = I, and the interval must be connected.
Intuitively, if a space is not connected, it is possible to define a continuous function which
37.4. CONNECTED SETS 1345
is constant on disjoint “connected components” and which takes possibly distinct values on
disjoint components. This can be stated in terms of the concept of a locally constant function.
Definition 37.22. Given two topological spaces X, Y , a function f : X → Y is locally
constant if for every x ∈ X, there is an open set U ⊆ X such that x ∈ U and f is constant
on U.
We claim that a locally constant function is continuous. In fact, we will prove that
f
−1
(V ) is open for every subset, V ⊆ Y (not just for an open set V ). It is enough to show
that f
−1
(y) is open for every y ∈ Y , since for every subset V ⊆ Y ,
f
−1
(V ) = [
y∈V
f
−1
(y),
and open sets are closed under arbitrary unions. However, either f
−1
(y) = ∅ if y ∈ Y −f(X)
or f is constant on U = f
−1
(y) if y ∈ f(X) (with value y), and since f is locally constant,
for every x ∈ U, there is some open set, W ⊆ X, such that x ∈ W and f is constant on W,
which implies that f(w) = y for all w ∈ W and thus, that W ⊆ U, showing that U is a union
of open sets and thus, is open. The following proposition shows that a space is connected iff
every locally constant function is constant:
Proposition 37.17. A topological space is connected iff every locally constant function is
constant. See Figure 37.23.

Figure 37.23: An example of a locally constant, but not constant, real-valued function f
over the disconnected set consisting of the disjoint union of the two solid balls. On the pink
ball, f is 0, while on the purple ball, f is 1.
Proof. First, assume that X is connected. Let f : X → Y be a locally constant function
to some space Y and assume that f is not constant. Pick any y ∈ f(X). Since f is not
constant, U1 = f
−1
(y) 6 = X, and of course, U1 6 = ∅. We proved just before Proposition
1346 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
37.17 that f

(V ) is open for every subset V ⊆ Y , and thus U1 = f
−1
(y) = f
−1
({y}) and
U2 = f
−1
(Y − {y}) are both open, nonempty, and clearly X = U1 ∪ U2 and U1 and U2 are
disjoint. This contradicts the fact that X is connected and f must be constant.
Assume that every locally constant function f : X → Y is constant. If X is not connected,
we can write X = U1 ∪ U2, where both U1, U2 are open, disjoint, and nonempty. We can
define the function, f : X → R, such that f(x) = 1 on U1 and f(x) = 0 on U2. Since U1 and
U2 are open, the function f is locally constant, and yet not constant, a contradiction.
A characterization on the connected subsets of R
n
is harder and requires the notion of
arcwise connectedness. One of the most important properties of connected sets is that they
are preserved by continuous maps.
Proposition 37.18. Given any continuous map, f : E → F, if A ⊆ E is connected, then
f(A) is connected.
Proof. If f(A) is not connected, then there exist some nonempty open sets, U, V , in F such
that f(A) ∩ U and f(A) ∩ V are nonempty and disjoint, and
f(A) = (f(A) ∩ U) ∪ (f(A) ∩ V ).
Then, f
−1
(U) and f
−1
(V ) are nonempty and open since f is continuous and
A = (A ∩ f
−1
(U)) ∪ (A ∩ f
−1
(V )),
with A ∩ f
−1
(U) and A ∩ f
−1
(V ) nonempty, disjoint, and open in A, contradicting the fact
that A is connected.
An important corollary of Proposition 37.18 is that for every continuous function, f : E →
R, where E is a connected space, f(E) is an interval. Indeed, this follows from Proposition
37.16. Thus, if f takes the values a and b where a < b, then f takes all values c ∈ [a, b].
This is a very important property known as the intermediate value theorem.
Even if a topological space is not connected, it turns out that it is the disjoint union of
maximal connected subsets and these connected components are closed in E. In order to
obtain this result, we need a few lemmas.
Lemma 37.19. Given a topological space, E, for any family, (Ai)i∈I , of (nonempty) con￾nected subsets of E, if Ai ∩ Aj 6 = ∅ for all i, j ∈ I, then the union, A =
S i∈I Ai, of the
family, (Ai)i∈I , is also connected.
Proof. Assume that S i∈I Ai
is not connected. There exists two nonempty open subsets, U
and V , of E such that A ∩ U and A ∩ V are disjoint and nonempty and such that
A = (A ∩ U) ∪ (A ∩ V ).
37.4. CONNECTED SETS 1347
Now, for every i ∈ I, we can write
Ai = (Ai ∩ U) ∪ (Ai ∩ V ),
where Ai ∩ U and Ai ∩ V are disjoint, since Ai ⊆ A and A ∩ U and A ∩ V are disjoint. Since
Ai
is connected, either Ai ∩ U = ∅ or Ai ∩ V = ∅. This implies that either Ai ⊆ A ∩ U or
Ai ⊆ A ∩ V . However, by assumption, Ai ∩ Aj 6 = ∅, for all i, j ∈ I, and thus, either both
Ai ⊆ A ∩ U and Aj ⊆ A ∩ U, or both Ai ⊆ A ∩ V and Aj ⊆ A ∩ V , since A ∩ U and A ∩ V
are disjoint. Thus, we conclude that either Ai ⊆ A ∩ U for all i ∈ I, or Ai ⊆ A ∩ V for all
i ∈ I. But this proves that either
A =
[
i∈I
Ai ⊆ A ∩ U,
or
A =
[
i∈I
Ai ⊆ A ∩ V,
contradicting the fact that both A ∩ U and A ∩ V are disjoint and nonempty. Thus, A must
be connected.
In particular, the above lemma applies when the connected sets in a family (Ai)i∈I have
a point in common.
Lemma 37.20. If A is a connected subset of a topological space, E, then for every subset,
B, such that A ⊆ B ⊆ A, where A is the closure of A in E, the set B is connected.
Proof. If B is not connected, then there are two nonempty open subsets, U, V , of E such
that B ∩ U and B ∩ V are disjoint and nonempty, and
B = (B ∩ U) ∪ (B ∩ V ).
Since A ⊆ B, the above implies that
A = (A ∩ U) ∪ (A ∩ V ),
and since A is connected, either A∩U = ∅, or A∩V = ∅. Without loss of generality, assume
that A ∩ V = ∅, which implies that A ⊆ A ∩ U ⊆ B ∩ U. However, B ∩ U is closed in
the subspace topology for B and since B ⊆ A and A is closed in E, the closure of A in B
w.r.t. the subspace topology of B is clearly B ∩ A = B, which implies that B ⊆ B ∩ U
(since the closure is the smallest closed set containing the given set). Thus, B ∩ V = ∅, a
contradiction.
In particular, Lemma 37.20 shows that if A is a connected subset, then its closure, A, is
also connected. We are now ready to introduce the connected components of a space.
1348 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Definition 37.23. Given a topological space, (E, O), we say that two points, a, b ∈ E, are
connected if there is some connected subset, A, of E such that a ∈ A and b ∈ A.
It is immediately verified that the relation “a and b are connected in E” is an equivalence
relation. Only transitivity is not obvious, but it follows immediately as a special case of
Lemma 37.19. Thus, the above equivalence relation defines a partition of E into nonempty
disjoint connected components. The following proposition is easily proved using Lemma 37.19
and Lemma 37.20:
Proposition 37.21. Given any topological space, E, for any a ∈ E, the connected component
containing a is the largest connected set containing a. The connected components of E are
closed.
The notion of a locally connected space is also useful.
Definition 37.24. A topological space, (E, O), is locally connected if for every a ∈ E, for
every neighborhood, V , of a, there is a connected neighborhood, U, of a such that U ⊆ V .
See Figure 37.24.

connected open sets.

There are connected spaces that are not locally connected and there are locally connected
spaces that are not connected. The two properties are independent. For example, the
subspace of R
2 S = {(x,sin(1/x)), | x > 0} ∪ {(0, y) | −1 ≤ y ≤ 1} is connected but not
locally connected. See Figure 37.25. The subspace S of R consisting [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] is locally
connected but not connected.
37.4. CONNECTED SETS 1349
Figure 37.25: Let S be the graph of f(x) = sin(1/x) union the y-axis between −1 and 1.
This space is connected, but not locally connected.
Proposition 37.22. A topological space, E, is locally connected iff for every open subset,
A, of E, the connected components of A are open.
Proof. Assume that E is locally connected. Let A be any open subset of E and let C be one of
the connected components of A. For any a ∈ C ⊆ A, there is some connected neighborhood,
U, of a such that U ⊆ A and since C is a connected component of A containing a, we must
have U ⊆ C. This shows that for every a ∈ C, there is some open subset containing a
contained in C, so C is open.
Conversely, assume that for every open subset, A, of E, the connected components of A
are open. Then, for every a ∈ E and every neighborhood, U, of a, since U contains some
open set A containing a, the interior,
◦
U, of U is an open set containing a and its connected
components are open. In particular, the connected component C containing a is a connected
open set containing a and contained in U.
Proposition 37.22 shows that in a locally connected space, the connected open sets form a
basis for the topology. It is easily seen that R
n
is locally connected. Another very important
property of surfaces and more generally, manifolds, is to be arcwise connected. The intuition
is that any two points can be joined by a continuous arc of curve. This is formalized as
follows.
1350 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Definition 37.25. Given a topological space, (E, O), an arc (or path) is a continuous map,
γ : [a, b] → E, where [a, b] is a closed interval of the real line, R. The point γ(a) is the initial
point of the arc and the point γ(b) is the terminal point of the arc. We say that γ is an arc
joining γ(a) and γ(b). See Figure 37.26. An arc is a closed curve if γ(a) = γ(b). The set
γ([a, b]) is the trace of the arc γ.

γ([a, b]). The torus is both arcwise connected and locally arcwise connected.
Typically, a = 0 and b = 1.

One should not confuse an arc, γ : [a, b] → E, with its trace. For example, γ could be
constant, and thus, its trace reduced to a single point.
An arc is a Jordan arc if γ is a homeomorphism onto its trace. An arc, γ : [a, b] → E,
is a Jordan curve if γ(a) = γ(b) and γ is injective on [a, b). Since [a, b] is connected, by
Proposition 37.18, the trace γ([a, b]) of an arc is a connected subset of E.
Given two arcs γ : [0, 1] → E and δ : [0, 1] → E such that γ(1) = δ(0), we can form a new
arc defined as follows:
Definition 37.26. Given two arcs, γ : [0, 1] → E and δ : [0, 1] → E, such that γ(1) = δ(0),
we can form their composition (or product), γδ,, defined such that

The inverse, γ

, of the arc, γ, is the arc defined such that γ

It is trivially verified that Definition 37.26 yields continuous arcs.
37.4. CONNECTED SETS 1351
Definition 37.27. A topological space, E, is arcwise connected if for any two points,
a, b ∈ E, there is an arc, γ : [0, 1] → E, joining a and b, i.e., such that γ(0) = a and
γ(1) = b. A topological space, E, is locally arcwise connected if for every a ∈ E, for every
neighborhood, V , of a, there is an arcwise connected neighborhood, U, of a such that U ⊆ V .
See Figure 37.26.
The space R
n
is locally arcwise connected, since for any open ball, any two points in this
ball are joined by a line segment. Manifolds and surfaces are also locally arcwise connected.
Proposition 37.18 also applies to arcwise connectedness (this is a simple exercise). The
following theorem is crucial to the theory of manifolds and surfaces:
Theorem 37.23. If a topological space, E, is arcwise connected, then it is connected. If a
topological space, E, is connected and locally arcwise connected, then E is arcwise connected.
Proof. First, assume that E is arcwise connected. Pick any point, a, in E. Since E is arcwise
connected, for every b ∈ E, there is a path, γb : [0, 1] → E, from a to b and so,
E =
[
b∈E
γb([0, 1])
a union of connected subsets all containing a. By Lemma 37.19, E is connected.
Now assume that E is connected and locally arcwise connected. For any point a ∈ E, let
Fa be the set of all points, b, such that there is an arc, γb : [0, 1] → E, from a to b. Clearly,
Fa contains a. We show that Fa is both open and closed. For any b ∈ Fa, since E is locally
arcwise connected, there is an arcwise connected neighborhood U containing b (because E
is a neighborhood of b). Thus, b can be joined to every point c ∈ U by an arc, and since
by the definition of Fa, there is an arc from a to b, the composition of these two arcs yields
an arc from a to c, which shows that c ∈ Fa. But then U ⊆ Fa and thus, Fa is open. See
Figure 37.27 (i.). Now assume that b is in the complement of Fa. As in the previous case,
there is some arcwise connected neighborhood U containing b. Thus, every point c ∈ U can
be joined to b by an arc. If there was an arc joining a to c, we would get an arc from a to b,
contradicting the fact that b is in the complement of Fa. Thus, every point c ∈ U is in the
complement of Fa, which shows that U is contained in the complement of Fa, and thus, that
the the complement of Fa is open. See Figure 37.27 (ii.). Consequently, we have shown that
Fa is both open and closed and since it is nonempty, we must have E = Fa, which shows
that E is arcwise connected.
If E is locally arcwise connected, the above argument shows that the connected compo￾nents of E are arcwise connected.

It is not true that a connected space is arcwise connected. For example, the space
consisting of the graph of the function
f(x) = sin(1/x),
where x > 0, together with the portion of the y-axis, for which −1 ≤ y ≤ 1, is connected,
but not arcwise connected. See Figure 37.25.

A trivial modification of the proof of Theorem 37.23 shows that in a normed vector
space, E, a connected open set is arcwise connected by polygonal lines (i.e., arcs consisting
of line segments). This is because in every open ball, any two points are connected by a line
segment. Furthermore, if E is finite dimensional, these polygonal lines can be forced to be
parallel to basis vectors.
We now consider compactness.
37.5 Compact Sets and Locally Compact Spaces
The property of compactness is very important in topology and analysis. We provide a quick
review geared towards the study of manifolds, and for details, we refer the reader to Munkres
[131], Schwartz [150]. In this section we will need to assume that the topological spaces are
Hausdorff spaces. This is not a luxury, as many of the results are false otherwise.
We begin this section by providing the definition of compactness and describing a col￾lection of compact spaces in R. There are various equivalent ways of defining compactness.
For our purposes, the most convenient way involves the notion of open cover.
37.5. COMPACT SETS AND LOCALLY COMPACT SPACES 1353
Definition 37.28. Given a topological space E, for any subset A of E, an open cover (Ui)i∈I
of A is a family of open subsets of E such that A ⊆
S i∈I Ui
. An open subcover of an open
cover (Ui)i∈I of A is any subfamily (Uj )j∈J which is an open cover of A, with J ⊆ I. An
open cover (Ui)i∈I of A is finite if I is finite. See Figure 37.28. The topological space E
is compact if it is Hausdorff and for every open cover (Ui)i∈I of E, there is a finite open
subcover (Uj )j∈J of E. Given any subset A of E, we say that A is compact if it is compact
with respect to the subspace topology. We say that A is relatively compact if its closure A
is compact.

U2
Figure 37.28: An open cover of S
2 using two open sets induced by the Euclidean topology
of R

.
It is immediately verified that a subset A of E is compact in the subspace topology
relative to A iff for every open cover (Ui)i∈I of A by open subsets of E, there is a finite open
subcover (Uj )j∈J of A. The property that every open cover contains a finite open subcover
is often called the Heine-Borel-Lebesgue property. By considering complements, a Hausdorff
space is compact iff for every family (Fi)i∈I of closed sets, if T i∈I Fi = ∅, then T j∈J Fj = ∅
for some finite subset J of I.

Definition 37.28 requires that a compact space be Hausdorff. There are books in which a
compact space is not necessarily required to be Hausdorff. Following Schwartz, we prefer
calling such a space quasi-compact.
Another equivalent and useful characterization can be given in terms of families having
the finite intersection property.
1354 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Definition 37.29. A family (Fi)i∈I of sets has the finite intersection property if T j∈J Fj 6 = ∅
for every finite subset J of I.
Proposition 37.24. A topological Hausdorff space E is compact iff for every family (Fi)i∈I
of closed sets having the finite intersection property, then T i∈I Fi 6 = ∅.
Proof. If E is compact and (Fi)i∈I is a family of closed sets having the finite intersection
property, then T i∈I Fi cannot be empty, since otherwise we would have T j∈J Fj = ∅ for some
finite subset J of I, a contradiction. The converse is equally obvious.
Another useful consequence of compactness is as follows. For any family (Fi)i∈I of closed
sets such that Fi+1 ⊆ Fi
for all i ∈ I, if T i∈I Fi = ∅, then Fi = ∅ for some i ∈ I. Indeed,
there must be some finite subset J of I such that T j∈J Fj = ∅, and since Fi+1 ⊆ Fi
for all
i ∈ I, we must have Fj = ∅ for the smallest Fj
in (Fj )j∈J . Using this fact, we note that R
is not compact. Indeed, the family of closed sets, ([n, +∞))n≥0, is decreasing and has an
empty intersection.
It is immediately verified that every finite union of compact subsets is compact. Similarly,
every finite union of relatively compact subsets is relatively compact (use the fact that
A ∪ B = A ∩ B).
Given a metric space, if we define a bounded subset to be a subset that can be enclosed
in some closed ball (of finite radius), then any nonbounded subset of a metric space is not
compact. However, a closed interval [a, b] of the real line is compact.
Proposition 37.25. Every closed interval, [a, b], of the real line is compact.
Proof. We proceed by contradiction. Let (Ui)i∈I be any open cover of [a, b] and assume that
there is no finite open subcover. Let c = (a + b)/2. If both [a, c] and [c, b] had some finite
open subcover, so would [a, b], and thus, either [a, c] does not have any finite subcover, or
[c, b] does not have any finite open subcover. Let [a1, b1] be such a bad subinterval. The
same argument applies and we split [a1, b1] into two equal subintervals, one of which must be
bad. Thus, having defined [an, bn] of length (b − a)/2
n as an interval having no finite open
subcover, splitting [an, bn] into two equal intervals, we know that at least one of the two
has no finite open subcover and we denote such a bad interval by [an+1, bn+1]. See Figure
37.29. The sequence (an) is nondecreasing and bounded from above by b, and thus, by a
fundamental property of the real line, it converges to its least upper bound, α. Similarly, the
sequence (bn) is nonincreasing and bounded from below by a and thus, it converges to its
greatest lowest bound, β. Since [an, bn] has length (b−a)/2
n
, we must have α = β. However,
the common limit α = β of the sequences (an) and (bn) must belong to some open set, Ui
, of
the open cover and since Ui
is open, it must contain some interval [c, d] containing α. Then,
because α is the common limit of the sequences (an) and (bn), there is some N such that
the intervals [an, bn] are all contained in the interval [c, d] for all n ≥ N, which contradicts
the fact that none of the intervals [an, bn] has a finite open subcover. Thus, [a, b] is indeed
compact.

The argument of Proposition 37.25 can be adapted to show that in R
m, every closed set,
[a1, b1] × · · · × [am, bm], is compact. At every stage, we need to divide into 2m subpieces
instead of 2.
We next discuss some important properties of compact spaces. We begin with two sepa￾rations axioms which only hold for Hausdorff spaces:
Proposition 37.26. Given a topological Hausdorff space, E, for every compact subset, A,
and every point, b, not in A, there exist disjoint open sets, U and V , such that A ⊆ U and
b ∈ V . See Figure 37.30. As a consequence, every compact subset is closed.

, A, is separated by any point in its complement.
1356 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Proof. Since E is Hausdorff, for every a ∈ A, there are some disjoint open sets, Ua and Va,
containing a and b respectively. Thus, the family, (Ua)a∈A, forms an open cover of A. Since
A is compact there is a finite open subcover, (Uj )j∈J , of A, where J ⊆ A, and then S j∈J Uj
is an open set containing A disjoint from the open set T j∈J
Vj containing b. This shows that
every point, b, in the complement of A belongs to some open set in this complement and
thus, that the complement is open, i.e., that A is closed. See Figure 37.31.

while V is the intersection of the seven open sets containing b.
Actually, the proof of Proposition 37.26 can be used to show the following useful property:
Proposition 37.27. Given a topological Hausdorff space E, for every pair of compact dis￾joint subsets A and B, there exist disjoint open sets U and V , such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V .
Proof. We repeat the argument of Proposition 37.26 with B playing the role of b and use
Proposition 37.26 to find disjoint open sets Ua containing a ∈ A, and Va containing B.
The following proposition shows that in a compact topological space, every closed set is
compact:
Proposition 37.28. Given a compact topological space, E, every closed set is compact.
Proof. Since A is closed, E − A is open and from any open cover, (Ui)i∈I , of A, we can form
an open cover of E by adding E − A to (Ui)i∈I and, since E is compact, a finite subcover,
(Uj )j∈J ∪ {E − A}, of E can be extracted such that (Uj )j∈J is a finite subcover of A. See
Figure 37.32.
Remark: Proposition 37.28 also holds for quasi-compact spaces, i.e., the Hausdorff separa￾tion property is not needed.

squares in R
2
. Note that an open cover of A, namely the green circles, when combined with
the yellow square annulus E − A covers all of the yellow square E.
Putting Proposition 37.27 and Proposition 37.28 together, we note that if X is compact,
then for every pair of disjoint closed sets A and B, there exist disjoint open sets U and V
such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V .
Definition 37.30. A topological space E is normal if every one-point set is closed, and for
every pair of disjoint closed sets A and B, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that
A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V . A topological space E is regular if every one-point set is closed, and for
every point a ∈ E and every closed subset B of E, if a /∈ B, then there exist disjoint open
sets U and V such that a ∈ U and B ⊆ V .
It is clear that a normal space is regular, and a regular space is Hausdorff. There are
examples of Hausdorff spaces that are not regular, and of regular spaces that are not normal.
We just observed that a compact space is normal. An important property of metrizable
spaces is that they are normal.
Proposition 37.29. Every metrizable space E is normal.
1358 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Proof. Assume the topology of E is given by the metric d. Since B is closed and A ∩ B = ∅,
for every a ∈ A since a /∈ B = B, there is some open ball B0(a, a) of radius  a > 0 such
that B0(a, a) ∩ B = ∅. Similarly, since A is closed and A ∩ B = ∅, for every b ∈ B there is
some open ball B0(b, b) of radius  b > 0 such that B0(b, b) ∩ A = ∅. Let
U =
[
a∈A
B0(a, a/2), V =
[
b∈B
B0(b, b/2).
Then A and B are open sets such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V , and we claim that U ∩ V = ∅.
If not, then there is some z ∈ U ∩V , which implies that for some a ∈ A and some b ∈ B,
we have
z ∈ B0(a, a/2) ∩ B0(b, b/2).
It follows that
d(a, b) ≤ d(a, z) + d(z, b) < ( a +  b)/2.
If  a ≤  b,then d(a, b) < b, so a ∈ B0(b, b), contradicting the fact that B0(b, b) ∩ A = ∅. If

b ≤  a,then d(a, b) < a, so b ∈ B0(a, a), contradicting the fact that B0(a, a) ∩ B = ∅.
Compact spaces also have the following property.
Proposition 37.30. Given a compact topological space, E, for every a ∈ E, for every
neighborhood, V , of a, there exists a compact neighborhood, U, of a such that U ⊆ V . See
Figure 37.33.

37.5. COMPACT SETS AND LOCALLY COMPACT SPACES 1359
Proof. Since V is a neighborhood of a, there is some open subset, O, of V containing a. Then
the complement, K = E −O, of O is closed and since E is compact, by Proposition 37.28, K
is compact. Now, if we consider the family of all closed sets of the form, K∩F, where F is any
closed neighborhood of a, since a /∈ K, this family has an empty intersection and thus, there
is a finite number of closed neighborhood, F1, . . . , Fn, of a, such that K ∩ F1 ∩ · · · ∩ Fn = ∅.
Then, U = F1 ∩ · · · ∩ Fn is closed and hence by Proposition 37.28, a compact neigborhood
of a contained in O ⊆ V . See Figure 37.34. aa

It can be shown that in a normed vector space of finite dimension, a subset is compact
iff it is closed and bounded. For R
n
the proof is simple.

In a normed vector space of infinite dimension, there are closed and bounded sets that
are not compact!
More could be said about compactness in metric spaces but we will only need the notion
of Lebesgue number, which will be discussed a little later. Another crucial property of
compactness is that it is preserved under continuity.
1360 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Proposition 37.31. Let E be a topological space and let F be a topological Hausdorff space.
For every compact subset, A, of E, for every continuous map, f : E → F, the subspace f(A)
is compact.
Proof. Let (Ui)i∈I be an open cover of f(A). We claim that (f
−1
(Ui))i∈I is an open cover of
A, which is easily checked. Since A is compact, there is a finite open subcover, (f
−1
(Uj ))j∈J ,
of A, and thus, (Uj )j∈J is an open subcover of f(A).
As a corollary of Proposition 37.31, if E is compact, F is Hausdorff, and f : E → F
is continuous and bijective, then f is a homeomorphism. Indeed, it is enough to show
that f
−1
is continuous, which is equivalent to showing that f maps closed sets to closed
sets. However, closed sets are compact and Proposition 37.31 shows that compact sets are
mapped to compact sets, which, by Proposition 37.26, are closed.
Another important corollary of Proposition 37.31 is the following result.
Proposition 37.32. If E is a compact nonempty topological space and if f : E → R is a
continuous function, then there are points a, b ∈ E such that f(a) is the minimum of f(E)
and f(b) is the maximum of f(E).
Proof. The set f(E) is a compact subset of R and thus, a closed and bounded set which
contains its greatest lower bound and its least upper bound.
The following property also holds.
Proposition 37.33. Let (E, d) be a metric space. For any nonempty subset A of E, if A
is compact, then for every open subset U such that A ⊆ U, there is some r > 0 such that
Vr(A) ⊆ U.
Proof. The function x 7→ d(x, E − U) is continuous and d(x, E − U) > 0 for x ∈ A (since
A ⊆ U). By Proposition 37.32, there is some a ∈ A such that
d(a, E − U) = inf
x∈A
d(x, E − U).
But d(a, E − U) = r > 0, which implies that Vr(A) ⊆ U.
Another useful notion is that of local compactness. Indeed manifolds and surfaces are
locally compact.
Definition 37.31. A topological space E is locally compact if it is Hausdorff and for every
a ∈ E, there is some compact neighborhood K of a. See Figure 37.33.
From Proposition 37.30, every compact space is locally compact but the converse is false.
For example, R is locally compact but not compact. In fact it can be shown that a normed
vector space of finite dimension is locally compact.
37.5. COMPACT SETS AND LOCALLY COMPACT SPACES 1361
Proposition 37.34. Given a locally compact topological space, E, for every a ∈ E, for every
neighborhood, N, of a, there exists a compact neighborhood, U, of a, such that U ⊆ N.
Proof. For any a ∈ E, there is some compact neighborhood, V , of a. By Proposition 37.30,
every neigborhood of a relative to V contains some compact neighborhood U of a relative
to V . But every neighborhood of a relative to V is a neighborhood of a relative to E and
every neighborhood N of a in E yields a neighborhood, V ∩ N, of a in V and thus, for every
neighborhood, N, of a, there exists a compact neighborhood, U, of a such that U ⊆ N.
When E is a metric space, the subsets Vr(A) defined in Definition 37.6 have the following
property.
Proposition 37.35. Let (E, d) be a metric space. If E is locally compact, then for any
nonempty compact subset A of E, there is some r > 0 such that Vr(A) is compact.
Proof. Since E is locally compact, for every x ∈ A, there is some compact subset Vx whose
interior
◦
V x contains x. The family of open subsets
◦
V x is an open cover A, and since A
is compact, it has a finite subcover {
◦
V x1
, . . . ,
◦
V xn }. Then U = Vx1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vxn
is compact
(as a finite union of compact subsets), and it contains an open subset containing A (the
union of the
◦
V xi
). By Proposition 37.33, there is some r > 0 such that Vr(A) ⊆
◦
U, and thus
Vr(A) ⊆ U. Since U is compact and Vr(A) is closed, Vr(A) is compact.
It is much harder to deal with noncompact manifolds than it is to deal with compact
manifolds. However, manifolds are locally compact and it turns out that there are various
ways of embedding a locally compact Hausdorff space into a compact Hausdorff space. The
most economical construction consists in adding just one point. This construction, known
as the Alexandroff compactification, is technically useful, and we now describe it and sketch
the proof that it achieves its goal.
To help the reader’s intuition, let us consider the case of the plane, R
2
. If we view the
plane, R
2
, as embedded in 3-space, R
3
, say as the xy plane of equation z = 0, we can consider
the sphere, Σ, of radius 1 centered on the z-axis at the point (0, 0, 1) and tangent to the xOy
plane at the origin (sphere of equation x
2 + y
2 + (z − 1)2 = 1). If N denotes the north pole
on the sphere, i.e., the point of coordinates (0, 0, 2), then any line, D, passing through the
north pole and not tangent to the sphere (i.e., not parallel to the xOy plane) intersects the
xOy plane in a unique point, M, and the sphere in a unique point, P, other than the north
pole, N. This, way, we obtain a bijection between the xOy plane and the punctured sphere
Σ, i.e., the sphere with the north pole N deleted. This bijection is called a stereographic
projection. See Figure 37.35.
The Alexandroff compactification of the plane puts the north pole back on the sphere,
which amounts to adding a single point at infinity ∞ to the plane. Intuitively, as we travel
away from the origin O towards infinity (in any direction!), we tend towards an ideal point
at infinity ∞. Imagine that we “bend” the plane so that it gets wrapped around the sphere,

according to stereographic projection. See Figure 37.36. A simpler example takes a line and
gets a circle as its compactification. The Alexandroff compactification is a generalization of
these simple constructions.
Definition 37.32. Let (E, O) be a locally compact space. Let ω be any point not in E,
and let Eω = E ∪ {ω}. Define the family, Oω, as follows:
Oω = O ∪ {(E − K) ∪ {ω} | K compact in E}.
The pair, (Eω, Oω), is called the Alexandroff compactification (or one point compactification)
of (E, O). See Figure 37.37.
The following theorem shows that (Eω, Oω) is indeed a topological space, and that it is
compact.
Theorem 37.36. Let E be a locally compact topological space. The Alexandroff compactifi-
cation, Eω, of E is a compact space such that E is a subspace of Eω and if E is not compact,
then E = Eω.
Proof. The verification that Oω is a family of open sets is not difficult but a bit tedious.
Details can be found in Munkres [131] or Schwartz [150]. Let us show that Eω is compact.
For every open cover, (Ui)i∈I , of Eω, since ω must be covered, there is some Ui0 of the form
Ui0 = (E − K0) ∪ {ω}
where K0 is compact in E. Consider the family, (Vi)i∈I , defined as follows:
Vi = Ui
if Ui ∈ O,
Vi = E − K if Ui = (E − K) ∪ {ω},

where K is compact in E. Then, because each K is compact and thus closed in E (since E
is Hausdorff), E − K is open, and every Vi
is an open subset of E. Furthermore, the family,
(Vi)i∈(I−{i0})
, is an open cover of K0. Since K0 is compact, there is a finite open subcover,
(Vj )j∈J , of K0, and thus, (Uj )j∈J∪{i0} is a finite open cover of Eω.
Let us show that Eω is Hausdorff. Given any two points, a, b ∈ Eω, if both a, b ∈ E, since
E is Hausdorff and every open set in O is an open set in Oω, there exist disjoint open sets,
U, V (in O), such that a ∈ U and b ∈ V . If b = ω, since E is locally compact, there is some
compact set, K, containing an open set, U, containing a and then, U and V = (E −K)∪ {ω}
are disjoint open sets (in Oω) such that a ∈ U and b ∈ V .
The space E is a subspace of Eω because for every open set, U, in Oω, either U ∈ O
and E ∩ U = U is open in E, or U = (E − K) ∪ {ω}, where K is compact in E, and thus,
U ∩ E = E − K, which is open in E, since K is compact in E and thus, closed (since E
is Hausdorff). Finally, if E is not compact, for every compact subset, K, of E, E − K is
nonempty and thus, for every open set, U = (E−K)∪{ω}, containing ω, we have U ∩E 6 = ∅,
