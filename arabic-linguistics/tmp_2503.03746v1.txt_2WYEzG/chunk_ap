There is a math problem and its corresponding solution. Please divide the 
given solution into individual steps logically. Use "Step n: " before 
each step to distinguish between different steps, where n is a positive 
integer starting from 1, representing the current step number. Only 
divide the steps without altering any information in the original 
solution. Please output only the divided solution steps in the format 
mentioned above, and do not include any additional information. Do not 
omit the final answer that is placed in boxed.

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of two next 
reasoning steps provided by two AI assistants to the question and 
partial reasoning steps displayed below. Your evaluation should 
consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given assistant A’s 
answer, and assistant B’s answer. Your job is to evaluate which 
assistant’s answer is better. You should compare the two responses and 
provide a detailed explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure 
that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence 
your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence 
your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as 
objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your 
final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if assistant A 
is better, and "[[B]]" if assistant B is better.
