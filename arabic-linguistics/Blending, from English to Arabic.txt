PREFACE 
 
 
 
This book aims to address the gap in the field of studying Arabic blends. 
It examines their structure in the light of the blend-formation tendencies that 
have been identified based on examining some prosodic features of blends 
in English.  
Blends in Classical Arabic are generally formed by joining the first two 
root consonants of each source word and imposing the prosodic pattern 
CaCCaC on them. Typical examples of Classical Arabic blends are 
/Ý§ab.dar(ij)/ âsomeone from the family of Abdul DÆUÂ´ < /Ý§DEGÂ³VODYHÂ´DQG
GDUÂ³KRXVHÂ´DQGÝ§ab.qas(ij)/ Â³VRPHRQHIURPWKHIDPLO\RI$EGXO4D\VÂ´ 
< /Ý§DEGÂ³VODYHÂ´DQGTDMVÂ³DPDOHQDPHÂ´ânames for Arab tribes in the 6th 
Century AD. However, such Classical blends are a few. However, the 
numerous blends that have been formed in Arabic in recent times do not 
appear to follow this root-and-pattern template. Examples are /faw.sÝ§awt(ij)/ 
Â³VXSHUVRQLFÂ´IDZTÂ³DERYHÂ´DQGVÝ§DZWLMÂ³VRXQGÂ´DQGTDEÆ«DUEÂ³SUH-
ZDUÂ´TDEOÂ³EHIRUHÂ´DQGÆ«DUEÂ³ZDUÂ´ 
The literature on Arabic linguistics does not show an in-depth 
investigation of the structure of modern Arabic blends; hence, this book 
aims to uncover the regularities that are found in these modern formations 
and in that way contributes to understanding the structure of Arabic words 
in general and blends in particular. The book also explains to what extent 
the blend-formation tendencies identified in English apply to blend 
formation in Arabic. 
The main blend material used in this book consists of established blends 
found in the literature on Arabic word-formation and novel blends created 
by native speakers in tasks specifically set up to address the assumption 
made in this book. The established Standard Arabic blends were examined 
to identify any tendencies in their formation that seem to be specific to 
Arabic and to, afterwards, determine if such tendencies are also found in the 
novel blends.  
Quantitative analysis of the established and novel Arabic blends 
demonstrates that there is a high degree of resemblance between modern 
Arabic blends and English blends as far as their prosodic features are 
concerned. 
This book is the revised version of my PhD Thesis in Linguistics and 
English Language at Newcastle University. I would like to dedicate this

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
1.1. Preliminaries 
It is noticed in our daily life as well as on several TV shows or series that 
speakers of Arabic use a technique by which they join two words in one 
word to jointly convey the meanings of the base words. One word was 
/laj.su:n/, which the person using it explained as a soft drink made from 
/laj.mu:n/ âlemonâ and /ja:.na.su:n/ âaniseâ. Another word was 
/ja.ta.Üµa:.Ã°Ý§am/; the person using it said it was formed from /ja.ta.Üµa:.dÝ§a:/ 
âignoreâ and /ja.ta.Ý§a:.Ã°Ý§am/ âincreaseâ. My household also made a good 
source for forming blend words for me. My eldest son (born in Baghdad in 
2004, living in the UK ever since 2013) when he was 10 years old, formed 
the blend fewseum referring to a âmuseumâ visited by âfewâ people, 
without being aware of the word Newseum (in Washington DC), which has 
a similar pattern: new + museum. Another word which was Monsday 
formed by my youngest son (born in Baghdad in 2011, living in the UK 
ever since 2013) explained to me that it referred to a trip that extended 
from Monday to Wednesday. My husband and I were not an exception for 
we also had our own blends in Arabic, English or French. My husband 
formed the blend /WÞ«an.WÞ«a.wi:l/ in Iraqi dialect with the meaning 
âextremely, hugely tallâ from <WÞ«an.WÞ«al> âa mythical creature that is huge, 
tall and scaryâ and <WÞ«a.wi:l> âtallâ. One of my blends in Arabic was 
/Üµa.Ýa:Ý¦/ âdinnerâ from /Üµa.da:Ý¦/ âlunchâ and /Ý§a.Ýa:Ý¦/ âsupperâ, in English 
was Hollangium referring to Baarle-Hertog, a village divided at the 
borders between Holland and Belgium, which I also Arabised into 
/ho.lan.dÝ¤i.ka:/ < /ho.lan.da:/ and /bal.dÝ¤i:.ka:/, and in French was jouge 
âred cheekâ from joue âcheekâ and rouge âredâ. 
These attempts at forming novel blends were the initial reason for 
starting this book. The knowledge I have about English blends and Arabic 
blends made me think of comparing the methods used in this process in 
these two languages.  
The linguistic phenomenon of blending, which is one of the means of 
adding neologisms to the lexicon, is widely recognised in English. 
Blending in English is a productive process of word formation whereby a 
new word is formed by joining parts of at least two other words as, for 
instance, the blend brunch which is formed by joining parts of the words 

1. Introduction

breakfast and lunch, motel from motor and hotel, and smog from smoke 
and fog (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 462). Blends in English are formed 
in such a way that at least one of the two words is shortened (Algeo 1991, 
10). For instance, the blend brunch is formed by joining the segments br- 
and -unch from the words breakfast and lunch respectively, with both 
words therefore shortened. Other cases of English blends involve a kind of 
overlap where both words have the same graphemes/phonemes at the 
joining point (Algeo 1977, 49). An example of this type is the blend 
slanguage, which is formed by joining the two words slang and language, 
where the string -lang- is found in both source words and therefore 
constitutes an overlap. There are also cases where one word or part of one 
word is inserted inside the other word, with or without truncation (Algeo 
1977, 49). An example of this type of blends is chortle, formed from 
chuckle and snort, with the segment -ort from the second word snort being 
inserted inside the first word chuckle, replacing the segment -uck-. 
The form of English blends was previously thought to be unpredictable 
and irregular ( (Bauer 1983, 225); (Marchand 1969)), but recent research 
(e.g. (Lehrer 2003); (Gries 2004a); (Gries 2004b); (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012); (Bauer 2012)) has shown that their formation, in fact, shows a 
considerable amount of regularity and predictability. These recent works 
have focused on the question of how and why English blends are formed 
the way they are rather than another way, and what the general tendencies 
for their formation and structure are.  
For the purpose of this book, three blend-formation features that have 
been identified in the literature on English blending are used as a basis for 
an examination of Arabic blends to assess the extent to which they also 
apply in Arabic. 
These features are: (1) the cut-off points in the source words; (2) the 
proportional contributions from the source words to the blend; and (3) the 
stress pattern of the resulting blend. These features are the most 
investigated ones in English and the tendencies that have been identified 
based on them were supported by evidence from large amounts of data. 
The success achieved in identifying tendencies and regularities in 
English blend formation raised the question of to what extent the same 
kinds of patterns exist in blending in other languages. There has indeed 
been some comparative work on blending, as in Renner, Maniez and 
Arnaud (2012) on English and Serbian, Kubozono (1990) on Japanese and 
English, and Renner (2019) on English and French. There has also been 
scholarly research on blending in other languages, as in Berman (1989), 
Bat-El (1996), and Pham (2011) on Hebrew, Fradin (2000) on French, 
PiÃ±eros (2004) on Spanish, Thornton (1993) and (2000) on Italian,

Ronneberger-Sibold (2006) and (2010) on German, Ralli and Xydopoulos 
(2012) on Greek, Konieczna (2012) on Polish, and Borgwaldt, Kulish and 
Bose (2012) on Ukrainian. However, the majority of studies have focused 
entirely on English, as in Algeo (1977), Cannon (1986), Cutler and Young 
(1994), Kelly (1998), Bertinetto (2001), Kemmer (2003), LÃ³pez 
RÃºa(2004), Hong (2005), Bat-El (2006) (2006), Lehrer (2007), Brdar-
SzabÃ³ and Brdar (2008), Cook and Stevenson (2010), Tomaszewicz 
(2012), Bat-El and Cohen (2012), Beliaeva (2014a) and (2014b). 
Since detailed analysis is necessary to uncover the relevant patterns (as 
shown by the fact that they were not recognised even in English until 
rather recently), progress at this stage is most likely to come from 
comparisons of the patterns found in English with those in other 
languages. In this book, the other language chosen for comparative 
purposes is Arabic. This language also has words that are formed by 
joining parts of other words, as in the blend  /rak.madÝ¤/ âto surfâ formed 
from /ra.kab/ ârideâ and /mawdÝ¤/ âwavesâ, and the blend Æ«DMQDEDWâa 
creature that is an animal and a plantâ formed from  Æ«DMDZDQâanimalâ 
and /na.ba:t/ âplantâ. Nevertheless, blend formation in Arabic has received 
very little linguistic attention so far. 
It is fair to say that there is a big gap in the literature on Arabic blends. 
In traditional grammars of Arabic, blends in Standard Arabic are described 
and classified based on other word-formation processes. However, these 
studies do not present a systematic account of blends analysed in terms of 
modern linguistic work on blending. Additionally, research on blends in 
Modern Standard Arabic is scarce, even though there has been a recent 
increase in the use of novel blends, especially in the domains of science, 
where blends are formed to refer to particular inventions, and in the media, 
where blends are used in comic shows, often to express sarcasm. To the 
best of my knowledge, there is no systematic linguistic analysis of the 
process of new-blend formation in Modern Arabic. The lack of such an 
analysis of this phenomenon in Arabic constitutes the major motivation for 
investigating blend formation in Arabic in this book.  
Because systematic linguistic research on Arabic blends is almost non-
existent, this book takes as its basis the results achieved in research on 
English blends and uses these as a guide to explore the so-far untrodden 
path of Arabic blending. Hence, this book aims to investigate the extent to 
which the features and tendencies identified as related to English blend 
formation can also be identified in blend formation in Arabic. The book is 
concerned with examining (novel) blends formed by Arabic speakers in 
the light of the already identified English blend-formation features and 
tendencies to assess the applicability of these tendencies in the context of

blend formation in Arabic. 
Arabic, a Semitic language, is very different from English. No 
previous research has jointly investigated blend formation in these two 
languages. However, when comparing two different languages like 
English and Arabic, and based on Kaunistoâs (2013, 6) statement that â[It] 
might be interesting to examine the structural aspects of blend words in 
different languages in a contrastive or comparative fashionâ, I propose that 
analysing Arabic blends in terms of English blend-formation tendencies 
would be beneficial. This is because it helps explore the extent to which 
linguistic resemblances or similarities can be identified. 
The investigation of the structure of blends in Arabic aims to provide 
insight into the nature of blending as a word-formation process in this 
language. It also leads to identifying the prevailing blend-formation 
tendencies in Arabic. The study also helps explore if there are any 
regularities in blend formation in Arabic that can contribute to the study of 
the morphological structure of the Arabic word. This book shows 
empirical results since it not only analyses existing blends but also 
investigates the formation of novel blends elicited from Arabic speaking 
informants.  
The two main questions at the heart of this book are as follows: 
 
1) Are there any Arabic-specific tendencies that can be identified in 
the blends investigated? 
2) To what extent do blend-formation tendencies identified based on 
the three main features of English blends also apply to blend 
formation in Arabic? 
 
It is essential at this point of the book to start with giving a brief overview 
of both blending in English (section 1.1.1) and blending in Arabic (section 
1.1.2) since they are the two major languages under investigation in this 
field. 
1.1.1. Overview of Blending in English 
This section presents an overview of the process of blending in English 
focusing on the analysis of features of blends proposed by Renner (2006).  
Blending in English is generally recognised as âa very productive 
source of words in modern Englishâ whereby a new word, namely a blend 
(word), is formed by joining parts from two or more words which are 
commonly referred to as source words (SWs) (Bauer 1983, 236-7). 
Examples are the blends brunch < breakfast and lunch, motel < motor and 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
5 
hotel, and smog < smoke and fog, where the parts in bold type form the 
blend and the bold parts that are underlined are points of overlap. 
The words involved in the process of blending are most often referred 
to as âsource wordsâ, but other terms are sometimes used such as âparent-
wordsâ (BergstrÃ¶m 1906), âconstituent wordsâ (Kelly 1998), âetymonsâ 
(Cannon 2000), âsource lexemesâ (Borgwaldt and Benczes 2011), or âbase 
wordsâ (Bat-El and Cohen 2012). The segments that constitute a blend are 
usually called âsplintersâ ( (Marchand 1969); (Lehrer 1996); (LÃ³pez RÃºa 
2012); (Ronneberger-Sibold 2012); (Beliaeva 2014a); (Beliaeva 2014b)), 
âsub-morphemic splintersâ or âfracto-lexemesâ (Renner 2014). These 
splinters are commonly joined to each other concatenatively; however, 
there are cases of blends in which part of one word is inserted within 
another, as is the case with the blend chortle < chuckle and snort, in which 
cases the blend may involve more than one segment from the source 
words. Such cases of blends have been referred to as âsandwich blendsâ 
((Algeo 1977); (Renner 2014)), âinterposed blendsâ (Cannon 1986), 
âdiscontinuous blendsâ (Lehrer 1996), âinfixed blendsâ (Danks 2003), 
âintercalative blendsâ ((Kemmer 2003); (Borgwaldt, Kulish and Bose 
2012); (Konieczna 2012)), âembedded blendsâ (Shaw 2013), or âcentral 
replacementâ blends ((Beliaeva 2014a); (Beliaeva 2014b)).  
Another important term that is encountered in studying blends is the 
joining point. This is the boundary point between the fracto-lexemes of a 
blend. It is also referred to as the âbreakpointâ (Kelly 1998), âswitching 
pointâ (Bertinetto 2001), âcrossover pointâ ( (Bauer 2012); (Borgwaldt, 
Kulish and Bose 2012)), âspliceâ (DiGirolamo 2012), or âsplit pointâ 
((Gries 2012); (Renner 2014)). 
This book, to maintain consistency, uses the term âsource wordsâ to 
refer to the words from which a blend is formed, âfracto-lexemesâ to refer 
to the segments of the source words that form the blend, âsandwich blendâ 
to refer to a blend formed by the non-continuous joining of fracto-lexemes, 
and âsplit pointâ to refer to the border point between fracto-lexemes. One 
further important term is âcut-off pointâ, which is used to refer to the point 
inside the source word where it is cut or shortened to give the fracto-
lexeme. 
Traditional accounts of the process of blending generally focus on one 
or a combination of the following points: (1) describing blending in terms 
of graphemes, or sometimes phonemes; (2) determining whether the 
fracto-lexemes are originally in the initial or final positions within their 
source words; and (3) the number of source words involved in the process, 
which is minimally two source words but occasionally three (e.g. 
compushity below, and turducken < turkey + duck + chicken) and only 

1. Introduction 
 
6 
rarely more than three. 
Algeo (1977, 48) defined blending as the process of combining two, or 
more, word forms where at least one of them is shortened. This definition, 
therefore, involves one of the points specified above, which is the 
minimum number of source words required to form a blend. Additionally, 
it indicates that the process of blending involves shortening in at least one 
source word. Later, Kaunisto (2000, 49) offered a definition based on the 
type of word-parts that are joined and stated that, in the process of 
blending, orthographic, or phonemic, items from the source words are 
joined together to form a blend.  
Gries (2004a, 416), on the other hand, presented a more detailed 
definition, which involved specifications of the type and location of the 
parts of the source words that are joined, in addition to the minimum 
number of source words required in the process. Gries (2004a, 416) 
defined blending as the process of âfusing parts of at least two source 
wordsâ where usually the fore part from the first source word combines 
with the hind part from the second source word with âsome phonemic or 
graphemic overlap of the source wordsâ. Griesâ (2004a, 416) definition 
applies to blends like motel but not like brunch. The former is formed by 
joining the fore part mot- from motor and the hind part -otel from hotel 
with the segment /-Ô¥Ýt-/ as the overlap point; whereas the latter is formed 
by joining the fore part br- from breakfast and the hind part -unch from 
lunch without any point of overlap, making it partially adhere to Griesâ 
(2004a, 416) definition. 
Research on English blends has shown that there are several tendencies 
governing blend formation in English, which have been identified and 
further investigated. This book focuses particularly on the tendencies that 
have been considered most frequently in the literature.  
These tendencies can be identified by examining specific definitional 
criteria that have been presented in the literature as characteristics that 
distinguish blends from other types of neologism. For example, Renner 
(2006) compared various, and sometimes conflicting, definitions 
attempting to identify the prototypical characteristics of English blends. 
Accordingly, Renner (2006, 139) specified three major types of 
ârestrictionsâ that can be used to identify blends. These restrictions are 
morphological, semantic and morpho-phonological. Renner (2006) tested 
the validity of these restrictions on English blends and classified blends 
into three groups ranging from the most typical, where all three of his 
restrictions apply, to the least typical, where only one of the restrictions 
applies. What follows gives an outline of Rennerâs restrictions on English 
blend-formation. 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
7 
The first restriction that Renner (2006) discusses is the morphological 
restriction whereby the truncation pattern of the source words corresponds 
to âan apocopeâ of the first source word and/or âan apheresisâ of the 
second source word. Renner (2006, 139)  gives three examples to explain 
this restriction, where three truncation patterns are identified. The first is 
the blend brunch, with the first source word breakfast undergoing apocope 
and the second source word lunch apheresis. The second example is the 
blend morphosyntax, with the first source word morphology undergoing 
apocope and the second source word syntax being present in its entirety. 
Finally, the third example is the blend claymation, with the first source 
word clay being present in its entirety and the second source word 
animation undergoing apheresis.  
Rennerâs (2006) truncation patterns correspond to the pattern of 
analysis proposed by Plag (2003) where the first source word is 
represented as AB and the second source word as CD, and accordingly, the 
types of blends given above can be represented as follows: 
AB+CD= AD (apocope and apheresis) 
AB+CD= ACD (only apocope) 
AB+CD= ABD (only apheresis) 
Renner (2006, 140)  states that there are cases that are not accounted 
for by these three patterns and are not referred to as blends but as âclipped 
compoundsâ because they do not fit into any of these three patterns. 
Renner (2006, 140) mentions that this term is adopted by Bauer and 
Huddleston (2002, 1635), Bauer (2003, 47), and Gries (2004b, 645-647). 
Examples include modem < modulator and demodulator, and sitcom < 
situation and comedy. These are both instances of biapocope, which, 
according to the patterns given above, correspond to AB+CD=AC, where 
both source words undergo apocope. 
The second restriction that Renner (2006, 140) specifies is semantic, 
whereby a blend should reflect the meanings of its source words. For 
example, smog is formed from the source words smoke and fog, and 
semantically refers to a combination of smoke and fog. This restriction 
does not apply to motel since the semantics of the source words is not 
reflected in the blend word, in that it is not both a motor and a hotel, or a 
combination of a motor and a hotel, but rather an abbreviated compound 
where the first source word modifies the second, as stated by Plag (2003, 
122).  
In terms of semantics, English blends can be divided into two groups: 
coordinate and determinative (Bauer 2012, 12). The former shows a 
paradigmatic relation between the source words, as in the blend smog < 
smoke and fog, and the latter a syntagmatic relation, as in the blend motel 

1. Introduction 
 
8 
< motor hotel (Dressler 2000, 5).  
For Renner (2006), the coordinate blends exhibit four semantic 
relationships. These are hybrid blends, like tigon < tiger and lion, addition 
blends, like semantax < semantics and syntax, polyvalence blends, like 
spork < spoon and fork, and tautologous blends, like rucus < ruction and 
rumpus. These semantic relations range from the most prototypical 
category of blends to the least, where hybrids are the most prototypical 
and tautologous the least. On the other hand, Bauer (2012, 19) states that 
the determinative blends have âa semantic structure more similar to 
endocentric compoundsâ.  
Most English blends, both attributive and coordinative, have the 
semantic characteristics of non-argumental compounds. An attributive 
blend is a hyponym of the second base word, and at the same time, the 
first base word has a âcontextually plausible relationship to the secondâ, 
e.g. daycation < day vacation is a one-day vacation (Bauer, Lieber and 
Plag 2013, 483).  
When it comes to the coordinative compounds, there are two types: 
appositive and compromise blends. The first type denotes âthe intersection 
of two types of entity or actionâ, e.g. fictomercial < fiction commercial is a 
work of fiction and a commercial at the same time. The second type 
denotes a hybrid entity or a concept, e.g. broccoflower < broccoli and 
cauliflower is a kind of vegetable that is somewhere between broccoli and 
cauliflower. 
Blends with argumental-compound semantics are affixal, and can be 
either object-referencing, e.g. agrimation < agriculture automation 
âautomation of agricultureâ, or subject-referencing, e.g. kidfluence < kid 
influence an âinfluence by kidsâ (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 483-4). 
There is a further miscellaneous group of so-called blends that cannot 
be so easily interpreted. These are the opaque cases of blends, such as 
Boyzilian < boy and Brazilian, âthe name for a bikini wax for menâ, and 
idiosyncratic-word-play blends, such as Internot < internet and not, âa 
person who refuses to use the internetâ (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 
485). 
Other than these last two types, blends are interpreted in the same way 
as compounds (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 485). In consideration of the 
features and categories of coordinative blends, this book is focusing on a 
particular type of blends, where there is a paradigmatic relation between 
the source words. 
The third restriction is morpho-phonological, whereby a blend is 
characterised by âinterpÃ©nÃ©trationâ (French for entanglement, nesting, 
telescoping). This characteristic applies in English to cases of blends with 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
9 
overlapping fracto-lexemes where at least one element of these fracto-
lexemes is common to both source words (Renner 2006, 141). For 
example, in motel, the part <ot> /Ô¥Ýt/ is shared by both motor and hotel, at 
both levels: orthography (motel < motor and hotel) and phonology 
(/mÔ¥ÝtÜ­l/ < /mÔ¥ÝtÔ¥/ and /hÔ¥ÝtÜ­l/).  
However, there are cases of blends where this kind of entanglement is 
incomplete because they can be interpreted either on the orthographic level 
or on the phonological level, but not, simultaneously, on both (Renner 
2006, 141). For instance, from an orthographic perspective, the <o> in the 
blend smog is considered to be common to both source words, smoke and 
fog, but phonologically, it is not, since the grapheme <o> represents /Ô¥Ý/ in 
smoke and /o/ in fog. On the other hand, the blend skyjack contains the 
diphthong /aÜ¼/, which is part of the phonology of both source words, sky 
and hijack, but is represented by different graphemes (<y> versus <i>).  
Cases of blends that have shared elements (whether on both, the 
orthographic and phonemic, levels or on either level) exhibit a kind of 
entanglement referred to as ambimorphemic (Renner 2006, 141). Other 
examples of ambimorphemic entanglement are the blends acupressure < 
acupuncture and pressure, planetesimal < planet and infinitesimal,1 and 
botox < botulin and toxin. Nevertheless, Renner (2006, 141) mentions that 
the literature on English blending does not identify this restriction as a 
definitional criterion for blends, possibly because it would exclude cases 
of blends like brunch, where no element can be found in both source 
words. 
Rennerâs (2006) restrictions form a specific scheme for examining the 
structure of English blends, where several features are considered at 
different linguistic levels: morphological, semantic and morpho-
phonological. The most commonly investigated features of the structure of 
English blends are those that are relevant to the morphological and 
morpho-phonological restrictions, which are subject to investigation in this 
book. As a result of research into the structure of English blends in terms 
of these features, many blend-formation tendencies have been identified in 
the literature and presented in section 3.5. 
1.1.2. Overview of Blending in Arabic 
In the traditional literature on blending in Arabic (e.g. (Ibn Manà¨ÇU; 
,EQ)ÆULV (1979), (1997), and (2001); (Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL; (Al-5Æ]L; 
(Al-Zubaydi 2003)), the word-formation process of blending is referred to 
as al-naÛt. Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL2 (1988, 60) was the first Arab linguist to discuss 
this linguistic phenomenon and to refer to it by this term, which literally 

1. Introduction 
 
10 
means âcarving, cutting, trimming, shortening, reducing, adjusting, 
constructingâ. To avoid confusion and to maintain consistency when 
referring to Arabic neologisms that correspond, by definition, to those 
formed by the process of blending in English, the term âblendingâ is used 
instead, and hence an Arabic neologism formed by this process is referred 
to as âa blendâ.  
Blending in Arabic is generally defined as the formation of a word by 
joining letters taken from two consecutive words or taken from a sentence, 
in such a way that the new word conveys the same meaning as that of the 
original words ( (Al-Maghribi 1908, 21); (Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL  ). 
Moreover, it is generally said that, when forming an Arabic blend, a 
formal relationship is established between the blend and the source words 
so that the letters of the blend all come from the source words (Al-0ÇVÆ
1966, 65-7).3  
Examples of Arabic blends mentioned in the literature about this process 
are shown in (a)-(d) below.

which was a name for an Arab tribe in the 6th century AD.

âgreatnessâ. 
 
To understand how words, in general, are formed in Arabic, it is important 
to have an idea about the structure of the word as well as the process of 
derivation in Arabic.  
Words in Arabic are characterised by a non-concatenative morphology 
((McCarthy 1981); (Watson 2002, 200); (Ouhalla 2012, 41)) whose basic 
units consist of a root and a derivational or inflectional pattern ((Cavalli-
Sforza, Soudi and Mitamura 2000, 86); (Saiegh-Haddad and Henkin-
Roitfarb 2014, 9)). In this process, the consonantal root forms the base that 
is mapped into a pattern consisting of a prosodic template, which is also 
referred to as the âderivational vocalic morphemeâ (Ouhalla 2012, 41-2). 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
11 
Because they cannot be realised in isolation from each other, the root and 
the pattern are unpronounceable bound morphemes.  
The root consists of a sequence of consonants that conveys the 
essential meaning (Bentin and Frost 1995, 273). They are mostly triliteral 
sequences such as /ktb/ âwriteâ, /drs/ âstudyâ, and /rsm/ âdrawâ. 
Quadriliteral sequences are also possible, though less common, such as 
/trdÝ¤m/ âtranslateâ, while biliteral sequences such as Æ«GÝ¤/ âpilgrimâ are 
rare.  
The patterns mostly take the form of vocalic/prosodic patterns that are 
spread over a consonantal base (Ouhalla 2012, 41). That is, patterns have 
âslots for the root consonantsâ to fill when forming the words (Saiegh-
Haddad and Henkin-Roitfarb 2014, 9). This indicates that the vocalisation of 
Arabic words does not take place at the level of the root but rather at the 
level of the word pattern where phonemic and morphosyntactic diacritics 
represent the vowels of the prosodic pattern ((Ouhalla 2012, 41); (Saiegh-
Haddad and Henkin-Roitfarb 2014, 18)).7 
A well-known example that shows how the root consonants are 
combined with a prosodic pattern is that of the root /ktb/ âwriteâ combined 
with the two patterns CaCaC and CaaCiC (Ouhalla 2012, 41). The 
consonant slots in the prosodic patterns are filled by the root consonants 
(Saiegh-Haddad and Henkin-Roitfarb 2014, 9). The first prosodic pattern 
gives the word /ka.tab/ âhe wroteâ and the second prosodic pattern gives 
the word /ka:.tib/ â(male) writerâ.  
Even though few blends have been identified in Classical Standard 
Arabic, an increasing number of novel examples can be found in Modern 
Standard Arabic. Neologisms formed by blending in Arabic enjoy growing 
popularity, especially in the media (Abdul-Âµ$]Æ¯]  -3) and in 
scientific fields such as chemistry and biology (Takeda 2011, 13). As has 
been pointed out, blending in Arabic, just like in English, is used to 
facilitate expression by means of reduction and brevity ( (Al-
ÆOÇVL
18-21); (Takeda 2011, 13)), by forming one word from two or more words 
while preserving the meaning of the original words ((Al-6KLKÆEL ; 
(Al-Khaà§¬Æ¯E). 
 
,EQ)ÆULV(1979, 271), a traditional linguist, defined blending simply as 
the process of forming one lexeme from two or more lexemes. However, 
this definition does not provide specific details about how the process 
operates. Some further detail on the outcome of blending is given by Al-
)DUÆKÆ¯GL (1988, 60), who described it as the process of âjoining two 
consecutive lexemes to form a new lexeme from which a verb is derivedâ, 
showing an awareness that the blend has the potential of acting as the base 

1. Introduction 
 
12 
for verb creation. 
Modern and contemporary linguists define blending as a process of 
forming âone unique lexemeâ by joining âletters taken from two lexemes 
or from a sentenceâ where the meanings of the original lexemes are 
conveyed by the new lexeme (Al-Maghribi 1947, 13). This definition goes 
further to refer to the selection of two or three words from a sentence to 
form a blend following the identified pattern for forming blends from any 
word pair. Although forming blends from words taken of sentences is not 
identified in English, the new Arabic word still conforms to the pattern of 
forming blends in Arabic. In this case, and this book, in particular, these 
blends are analysed as being formed from these source words, not from the 
sentence, since not all words in the sentence contribute to forming the 
blend. 
1.2. The Motivation of the Book 
This book is based on the assumption that there is, to some extent, a 
resemblance between the blend-formation tendencies of Arabic and those 
of English. To identify the nature and degree of any resemblance between 
the blends of these two languages, blends from Arabic were examined in 
the light of English blend-formation tendencies.  
In recent years, different types of blends have also appeared in Arabic. 
These types look more like the result of concatenating word parts, the way 
it is done in blends in English and other languages. Although this process 
seems to be relatively new in Arabic (and is condemned by some 
traditional Arab grammarians), there are already substantial numbers of 
words of this type and new ones that can regularly be encountered in the 
media. The study of such new blends and the principles governing their 
formation still needs to commence. This book aims to contribute to such a 
start. 
Moreover, the lack of a systematic, quantitative analysis of this 
phenomenon in Arabic constitutes the major motivation for investigating 
blend formation in Arabic in this book, which has led to posing the main 
assumption in this book, which is: Blend-formation features and 
tendencies that are identified for blend formation in English can, to some 
extent, be applicable to blend formation in Arabic. 
1.3. Structure of the Work 
The remainder of this book consists of five chapters. Chapter 2 outlines 
the methodology, describing the datasets (section 2.1), the methods of data 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
13 
collection (section 2.2), and the initial results and processing of the data 
(section 2.3). Chapter 3 presents an overview of the literature on blend 
formation in English focusing mainly on blend-formation features and 
tendencies (section 3.5) that have been identified in studies on English 
blends. Chapter 4 is an overview of blending in Arabic with a focus on the 
classification of Arabic blends (section 4.2) and the tendencies in Classical 
Arabic blend formation (section 4.3). Chapter 5 presents the analysis of 
the data, with both the established Arabic blends (section 5.2) as well as 
the novel ones produced by the informants (section 5.3), examined based 
on the major English blend-formation features and tendencies identified in 
chapter 3; chapter 5 concludes by presenting some further observations 
from the novel invented blends (section 5.4). Finally, chapter 6 starts with 
preliminaries about the motivation for commencing this book (section 6.1) 
and summarises the findings of this book within a set of conclusions 
(section 6.2). 

2. DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
 
 
 
2.1. Datasets 
The corpora examined for this book consist of two datasetsâone of the 
established blends and one of the novel invented blends. These blends 
were analysed to find answers to the questions posed in section 1.1. 
The first dataset was analysed based on the two methods identified in 
the literature on Arabic blends that are outlined in section 4.3. These 
methods are: (1) the root-and-pattern method, and (2) the concatenation 
method.  
The second dataset was analysed as related to the tendencies identified 
for the three major features of English blend formation that are outlined in 
section 3.5. These features are: (1) the cut-off points in the source words, 
(2) the proportional contributions from source words to blends, and (3) the 
stress patterns of the blends. 
2.1.1. The Established Arabic Blends  
The first dataset consists of two subsets of established Arabic blends: 
blends found in Classical Arabic and blends found in Modern Arabic. Both 
sets were compiled from articles, sources and websites. The full sets of the 
blends, their source words and glosses of their meaning are given in 
Appendices II and III. Table 2.1 below displays sample data from 
Classical Arabic (1-6) and Modern Arabic (7-12). Established blends and 
their source words in this table and all tables that follow are given in their 
stem-form unless it is necessary to give them in their full word form.

âairâ (reversed blend) 
 
All of the blends examined in this book are formed from two source 
words; nevertheless, it is not unusual to find a blend formed from three 
source words; an example is the blend /sÝ§al.Ý§am(a)/ meaning someone is 
saying âMay Allah pray on and greet himâ; âhimâ refers to Prophet 
Muhammed (peace be upon him) < /sÝ§al.la:/ âprayedâ, /Ý§a.la:/ âuponâ, and 
/sal.lam(a)/ âgreetedâ.  
It is also important to note that the order of the source words is 
maintained in most of the blends. Two exceptions are the blends 
/haw.mal(a)/ ÏË´Ï£Ï®Ë´Ï« âairborneâ < /Æ«DPDOD and /ha.wa:Ý¦/ Ë¯ÎÏ®Ë´Ï« ÏË´Ï¤Ë´Î£ âairâ and 
âcarryâ, and /dÝ¤aw.qal(a)/ ÏË´ÏÏ®Ë´Î âairborneâ < /na.qal(a)/ and /dÝ¤aw/ Ï®Ë´Î Ë´ÏË´ÏË´Ï§ 
âairâ and âtransportâ. The blend /dÝ¤aw.qal/ is formed from the source 
words /na.qal/ and /dÝ¤aw/, which appear in the original context as âS. 
/na.qa.la/ O. /dÝ¤aw.wan/â (S.V.O.Adv.), and the blend /haw.mal/ is formed 
from the source words Æ«DPDO and /ha.wa:Ý¦/, which also appear in the 
original context as S. /Æ«DPDOD O. /bil ha.wa:Ý¦/ (S.V.O.PP.). This 
indicates that it is not unusual to find blends that could be formed by

joining the source words in a reversed order. 
2.1.2. The Novel Invented Arabic Blends 
Two methods of data collection were used to collect the novel invented 
blends examined in this book. The data were invented blends elicited from 
native speakers of Arabic. To collect sufficient amounts of data, two 
structured anonymous methods of data collection were administered: one 
took the form of an online survey and the other a face-to-face experiment. 
A pilot test conducted with one respondent to the survey and one 
participant in the experiment whose responses were also analysed was 
conducted to make sure that the timing, the instructions, the given word 
pairs and their order of presentation were suitable for the investigation. 
The pilot test did not result in the identification of any problems related to 
the methodology. 
Steps were taken to make sure that anyone who took part in the 
experiment had not previously participated in the online survey since the 
survey had been posted online two months before the experiment started. 
This step was important to guarantee that the participants were producing 
spontaneous, genuine blends that they had not produced before. 
The instructions, the questions asked, and the stimuli used in the data 
collection were all written in Modern Standard Arabic. This variety is the 
one used in all school textbooks and the one that all literate native 
speakers of any Arabic dialect can read, write and understand.  
Demographic questions at the beginning of the survey asked the 
respondents about their mother language and their country of birth, to 
make sure that they were native speakers of Arabic who were born to Arab 
parents and grew up in an Arab country. 
The instructions given for both the survey and the experiment began 
with some examples of blends in Arabic, including established as well as 
novel blends, to clearly illustrate what the participants were going to be 
asked to do.  
Each method of data collection consisted of a task that required the 
informant to form possible blends from the stimuli given. The stimuli took 
the form of pairs of words. In both the survey and the experiment, 
informants were asked to provide only one response per stimulus (see 
Appendix D for the stimuli used in both methods of data collection).

2.2. Methods of Data Collection 
This section outlines the methods of data collection: the survey (section 
2.2.1) and the experiment (section 2.2.2). The selection and type of stimuli 
used in both methods of data collection are discussed in section 2.2.3. 
Section 2.2.4 is a description of the informants who participated in both 
methods of data collection. The debriefing that followed the experiment is 
discussed in section 2.2.5. 
2.2.1. The Survey 
The survey was conducted online. A link to the survey was posted on 
several social media websites and mailing lists. The instructions for the 
survey were given in Modern Standard Arabic. They included detailed 
explanations about the procedures that should be followed in responding to 
the survey questions. The respondents were asked to respond 
orthographically, writing their answers in Standard Arabic. The word pairs 
used as stimuli in the survey appeared as soon as the respondents clicked 
ânextâ on the screen. The survey instructions asked the respondents to 
diacritise their responses; and for this purpose, they were provided with a 
link to an Arabic keyboard where they could type the letters and diacritics 
they needed and then copy and paste them into the survey response slot. 
2.2.2. The Experiment 
The material for the experiment was shown to the participants in the same 
format as in the survey, with one difference: in the experiment, the word-
pair stimuli were displayed to participants by the researcher using 
PowerPoint slides. As with the survey, the experiment was promoted on 
several social media websites and mailing lists. The instructions for the 
experiment were also given in Modern Standard Arabic. They also 
included detailed explanations about the procedures that should be 
followed while participating in the experiment. The participants were 
given written information and consent forms in English and Arabic to sign 
before participation.  
Unlike in the survey, the participants in the experiment were asked to 
respond orally to the stimuli. The word-pair stimuli appeared as soon as 
the researcher clicked on ânextâ, which was done immediately after the 
participant had given his/her response to the previous stimulus. All 
responses in the experiment were audio-recorded.  

2. Data and Methodology 
18 
2.2.3. The Stimuli 
The responses that formed the dataset to be analysed were potential Arabic 
blends formed by joining parts of at least two words. It has been suggested 
that it is an essential requirement for an Arabic blend that it is formed by 
joining at least two source words (Al-4ÆVLPL. This is similar to 
the basic requirement stated for blend formation in English, described by 
Renner (2006, 139) as the minimal definitional criterion (see section 
1.1.1). Most of the blends, whether established or invented, that have been 
examined in previous studies of English were indeed formed from two 
source words; accordingly, this criterion was also used in collecting the 
data examined in this book, where all the stimuli in the survey and the 
experiment were word pairs, namely coordinates. See Appendix D for the 
full list of stimuli given in Arabic with their phonemic transcription and 
glossing. 
The stimuli used in the online survey were also used in the face-to-face 
experiment. The stimuli were word pairs that were presented to the 
informant as source words from which they were asked to form a blend. 
The words in each pair had a paradigmatic relationship to each other 
((Dressler 2000); (Plag 2003); (Beliaeva 2014a, 43))ÊLQRWKHUZRUGVWKH\
were purposely selected based on belonging to the same semantic 
category, such as food, metals or currency, as well as to the same syntactic 
category, namely nouns. This choice was motivated by considering that 
when informants were faced with a word pair like bread and cheese or 
gold and diamond (same part of speech, same semantic field) they might 
find it relatively natural to form a blend because it would have predictable 
semantics (âa bit of X and a bit of Yâ or âX and Y combinedâ).  
Many existing English blends are also of this type; that is, combining 
source words that have a semantic relationship. These blends have 
combinations of the properties of their source words, as is the case with 
the blends chofa < chair and sofa, and blizzaster < blizzard and disaster 
(Beliaeva 2014a, 43). 
Beliaeva (2014a, 44) extracted blends for her study from the Corpus of 
Contemporary American English (COCA) and found that 108 blends 
reflected this type of semantic relationship between the source words. The 
situation might be different if informants were given word pairs without a 
paradigmatic relationship, such as with a syntagmatic relationship since 
this might result in confusion about what kind of meaning the blend could 
have. However, blends of this type do exist. Examples include mansplain 
<man and explain (formed from a noun and a verb), and fake-ation <fake 
and vacation or briet <bridal and diet, both formed from an adjective and 
a noun, in which the source words show a subordinative combination

19 
(Beliaeva 2014a, 44).  
Since the informants in the survey and the experiment were asked to 
create a novel blend on the spot, it was felt that the bread and cheese type 
of word pairs was best. There were indeed no signs that participants 
experienced at any point any uncertainty about the basic meaning of the 
blends they were asked to create. Some of the stimuli were selected in a 
way to have a certain amount of graphemic or phonemic similarity at some 
point in some of the words, which allowed the creation of potentially 
overlapping blends to be examined as well. 
The survey and experiment used the same stimuli, consisting of two 
lists, each containing nine word-pairs. The same nine word-pairs appeared 
in each list, in the same sequence. The only difference between the two 
lists was that, for each word-pair, the second list reversed the order of the 
wordsâthat is, for each word-pair, the order Word I + Word II of the first 
list became Word II + Word I in the second list. In all cases, the words 
were established Modern Standard Arabic words that can be read and 
understood by any speaker of Arabic, and they were displayed in Arabic 
script. The complete set of stimuli (in Arabic with English translations 
given) is displayed in Table 2.2 below.

2.2.4. The Informants 
The total number of respondents to the survey was 63, and 32 people 
participated in the experiment. In both cases, participation was limited to 
native speakers of Arabic, regardless of their dialect or their citizenship. 
Before beginning the survey or experiment, the informants were asked to 
confirm that they had been born in an Arab country to Arab-speaking 
parents and that their basic education had been in Modern Standard 
Arabic. Beyond this, no further, identifying demographic information was 
collected. Of the participants in the experiment, 20 were studying or living 
in Newcastle, while 12 were recruited in Baghdad. 
2.2.5. Debriefing 
At the end of the experiment, the informants were asked about the 
technique they followed when forming blends from word pairs that have 
common elements like  Ï¦Ë¸ÎËµÎ /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and  Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ§ /xubz/ âbreadâ. They 
were asked how they chose the fracto-lexemes from these source words. 
There was a consensus on the point where they cut the words.  
The feedback showed that the informants preferred to cut what they 
called âorthographic unitsâ and use these as fracto-lexemes. These units 
for the informants include:  
 
- a grapheme-consonant with its diacritic from the first source word 
and the final consonant cluster from the second source word, as in 
the blend  Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ /dÝ¤ubz/ < Ï¦Ë¸ÎËµÎ /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and  Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ§ /xubz/ 
âbreadâ, where for this response all informants stated that they cut 
Ï¦Ë¸ÎËµÎ this way 
 ËµÎ
Ï¦Ë¸Î|  /dÝ¤u|bn/ and Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ§ this way 
 ËµÎ¥
Î°Ë¸Î|  /xu |bz/; or  
- a sequence of graphemes where all the graphemes they use as 
fracto-lexemes are connected in the source words, as in the blend 
ÎË´Ï«ÎÏ£ /ma:.hab/ < Î±ÎÏ£ /ma:s/ âdiamondâ and 
  
ÎË´Ï«Ë´Î«  /Ã°a.hab/ âgoldâ, 
where for this response all informants stated that they cut Î±ÎÏ£ this 
way 
ÎÏ£
Î±|  /ma:|s/ and ÎË´Ï«Ë´Î« this way 
 Ë´Î«
ÎË´Ï«|  /Ã°a. |hab/.  
 
This feedback is implemented in the analysis of the responses, 
especially for the feature of cut-off points (section 5.3.1) and that of 
proportional contributions (section 5.3.2). 
Although the technique followed by the informants does not allow for 
having potential cases of blends with overlap when the source words have 
common elements, the analysis still considers these blends, where 
possible, as having shared elements. For instance, the blend  Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ /dÝ¤ubz/ 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
21 
given above as showing no overlap can also be analysed as having overlap 
where the segment /ub/ is common to both source words due to having the 
source word Ï¦Ë¸ÎËµÎ /dÝ¤ubn/ cut inside the coda Ë¸ÎËµÎ
Ï¥_
 /dÝ¤ub_n/ and the second 
source word Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ§ /xubz/ cut between the onset and the nucleus Ëµ_Î¥
Î°Ë¸Î
 /x_ubz/. 
Moreover, although the discussion in this book adheres to the idea that 
the formation of blends can involve the overlapping of elements shared by 
both source words, the analysis of responses based on the proportional 
contribution from the source words to the blends still deals with both 
modes of analysesâwithout overlap, referred to in this book as the first 
mode of analysis (henceforth in tables, MoA1) and with overlap, referred 
to as the second mode of analysis (henceforth in tables, MoA2).  
2.3. Results and Processing of the Data 
This section is a description of the data compiled for examination. Section 
2.3.1 discusses the established Arabic blends and how they were compiled 
and section 2.3.2 discusses the novel blends that were invented by the 
native speakers of Arabic who participated in the Survey and Experiment. 
2.3.1. The Established Arabic Blends 
The overall dataset of established blends consists of 99 blendsâ61 blends 
from Classical Arabic and 38 blends from Modern Arabic. All of these 
blends are phonemically transcribed, following the list of IPA mapping for 
Arabic given in Appendix A. The roots and patterns of these blends were 
checked in some websites and dictionaries, such as The Dictionary of 
Meanings Ï²Ï§ÎÏÏ¤ÏÎÎ±Ï®Ï£ÎÏ  (2010)  accessed via https://www.almaany.com/, 
The Lexicon (Ï¢Î ÏÏ¤ÏÎ) (2016) accessed via https://www.almougem.com/, The 
International Corpus of Arabic (2013) accessed via http://www.bibalex.org/ 
ica/en/About.aspx, and The Aratools Arabic-English Dictionary  (2015) 
accessed via http://aratools.com/. 
The dataset includes blends that are formed from source words of non-
Arabic origin; these are loans into Arabic that have been nativised in some 
way and used as source words for Arabic blends. Arabised words of this 
type are treated the same way Arabic words are when it comes to 
identifying their roots. Although borrowed words are not recorded in any 
of the online Arabic dictionaries or corpora that were consulted, yet their 
roots were extracted by taking out their skeletal consonant letters after 
excluding any affixes they have acquired due to Arabisation. Whenever a 
word of non-Arabic origin is cited in this book, it is marked as such by the 
code ân-Arb.Wâ next to it. Examples of Arabised words are /du:la:r/

âdollarâ, which is used in one of the word pairs in the survey and 
experiment, /tal.fa.za/ âto televiseâ and /tal.fa.na/ âto telephoneâ. 
Considering the root structure of the source words throughout the analysis, 
whether for Arabic or Arabised words, makes it easier to relate their 
structure with that of the resulting blend. 
2.3.2. The Novel Invented Arabic Blends 
The raw number of responses collected overall in the Survey and 
Experiment was 1710, with 1134 written responses from the survey 
stimuli (63 respondents x 18 word-pairs), and 576 spoken responses from 
the experiment stimuli (32 participants x 18 word-pairs).  
The first step in processing the data was to phonemically transcribe the 
word pairs and the responses. As part of this transcription, syllable 
boundaries were also indicated in the word pairs and in the fully 
diacritised and fully vowelised responses (more details of diacritisation 
and vowelisation of the responses are given in section 2.3.3 below). The 
second step in processing the data was to filter out all irrelevant and 
unsuitable responses in line with a set of systematic criteria outlined in 
section 2.3.4 below. 
To get a sense of the kinds of responses that were given and the way 
the initial processing was conducted, it is useful to consider Table 2.3 and 
Table 2.4 below which record the most frequent responses given for each 
word pair in the survey and experiment respectively. Note that some of the 
responses given in Table 2.3 lack vowels due to the respondentsâ frequent 
failure to supply diacritics in the survey. All the responses, including those 
that were undiacritised, partially diacritised and fully diacritised, were 
phonemically transcribed in order to maintain consistency in the 
representation of the responses in the dataset. 
In Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 below, and all subsequent examples from 
the dataset, any element in a source word that is carried over into the blend 
is marked in bold. Elements of the blend that are found in both source 
words (henceforth referred to as overlapping segments) are additionally 
marked in italics in the transcriptions of the source words. Syllable 
boundaries are shown using a dot in the source words and the blends. 
Stress will be indicated in the source words and the blends only when the 
discussion turns to the consideration of the stress pattern of the responses.

2. Data and Methodology 
24 
It is noted that several items in these two lists, which are representative of 
similar responses in the whole dataset, contain segments that are found in 
both source words. Nevertheless, these segments are not shown in bold 
italics as being overlapping segments as noted earlier. For instance, the 
segments /d/ and /a:r/ in the blend /du:.na:r/, given as a response to the 
word pair /du:.la:r/ âdollarâ and /di:.na:r/ âdinarâ (and appearing in both 
tables above), are interpreted as coming from word I /du:.la:r/ and from 
word II /di:.na:r/, respectively and not from both source words. However, 
the segment /ub/ in the blend /dÝ¤ubz/ is interpreted as coming from both 
source words /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and /xubz/ âbreadâ.  
The reason for making this distinction is that responses of the former 
type have segmental overlaps that are not sequential across the source 
words. Another reason for not considering them as cases of overlap is that, 
if the blends were examined in terms of cut-off points, there would be 
multiple such points in the source words, leading to complications in the 
interpretation of the results. A specimen analysis of the multiple-overlap 
English blend fantabulous < fantastic and fabulous is given by Gries 
(2004b, 655-6), who examined the sequential contribution and non-
sequential contribution separately. The second method indeed causes great 
difficulties in the comparison of blends. Hence, only the first procedure of 
analysis is adopted in the analysis of the data compiled.   
There are also a few cases of central replacement (Beliaeva 2014a, 35), 
where one segment from one source word replaces a segment in the other 
source word as, for example, in the English blend parahawking < 
paragliding and hawk. An example from the dataset is the blend /zaj.tar/ 
given as a response to the word pair /zaÝ§.tar/ âthymeâ and /zajt/ âoilâ. 
Although such cases have more than one switch point in either or both of 
the source words, they are briefly discussed in Chapter 5 referred to as 
âsandwich blendsâ. 
2.3.3. Variation in the Diacritisation and Vowelisation  
of the Responses 
It is noteworthy that, despite the explicit instructions asking the 
respondents to the survey for full diacritisation of their responses, most of 
the written responses were not diacritised at all. Some responses were only 
partially diacritised. This meant that the nature of the short vowels in the 
blends (where they should be used) was either not or only partially 
indicated. Examples of undiacritised responses are the blend Î°ÎÎ /dÝ¤bz/ 
given as a response to the word pair Ï¦Ë¸ÎËµÎ /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and Î°Ë¸ÎËµÎ§ /xubz/ 
âbreadâ, and the blend Ï¦ÎÏ Î /dÝ¤lbn/ given as a response to the word pair Ï¦Ë¸ÎËµÎ 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
25 
/dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and Ï¦Ë´ÎË´Ï /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ. Examples of partially 
diacritised responses are the blend Î®Ï¤Ë´Ï /lamr/ given as a response to the 
word pair Ï¦Ë´ÎË´Ï /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and 
  
Î®Ë¸Ï¤Ë´Î  /tamr/ âdatesâ, and the blend ÎÏ´ÏË´Î¯ 
/zaÝ§jt/ given as a response to the word pair Î®Ë´ÎË¸ÏË´Î¯ /zaÝ§.tar/ âthymeâ and ÎË¸Ï³Ë´Î¯ 
/zajt/ âoilâ.  
This lack of full diacritisation in the data is not entirely surprising since 
it is not unusual to find Arabic texts in which words are written without 
some or all of the diacritics that could be used. Although full diacritisation 
is always used in headwords in Arabic dictionaries and in literary, and 
especially poetic, texts, diacritics are often left out in casual, non-formal 
writing in Arabic. 
To make clear what is at stake, it may be helpful at this point to give a 
little more detail about the role that diacritics play, in general, in the way 
that Arabic words can be written. There are four major diacritics in Arabic, 
which are written over or below consonant or semi-consonant graphemes. 
Three of them represent the three short vowels of Arabic, namely  Ë´à¬
< > /a/,  
 Ëµà¬
< > /u/, and  Ë¶à¬
< > /i/. The fourth diacritic, which is called VXNÇQ âsilenceâ, 
and is written as a small circle over the grapheme  Ë¸à¬
< > indicates that the 
consonant-grapheme over which it is placed is not followed by a short 
vowel. Examples of the use of these four diacritics in combination with, 
for instance, the consonant-grapheme <Î> (representing /t/) are as 
follows: <Ë´Î> /ta/, <ËµÎ> /tu/, <Ë¶Î> /ti/, and <Ë¸Î> /t/. The corresponding 
romanised spellings would be <ta, tu, ti, t>. Unlike the short vowels, the 
three corresponding long vowels of Arabic â<Î> /a:/, <Ï­> /u:/ and <Ï±> 
/i:/â are represented orthographically by separate vowel-graphemes rather 
than diacritics. Examples of words containing such long vowels are Ë¯ÎÏ£  
/ma:Ý¦/ âwaterâ, ËµÏ­Î©
Î©  /du:d/ âwormsâ, and ÏÏ³Î­ /ri:f/ âcountrysideâ.  
In addition to the four short-vowel diacritics, some other marks are 
also referred to as diacritics. These are used over or below graphemes to 
indicate one of three possible cases. One indicates the presence of a final 
post-nasalised short vowel, phonemically represented as /an/, /un/, and 
/in/, which can appear in words only when used in context. Another 
indicates the so-called elongated final vowel mark <Î> /a:/ which is 
transcribed exactly as the long vowel <Î> /a:/, and which is, in fact, a mark 
that in a way merely repeats information already given by the vowel letter 
itself. A third indicates consonant gemination, which is represented by the 
mark <Ë·à¬> over the relevant consonant grapheme. None of the stimulus 
word-pairs contained these marks (except for the mark of the elongated 
final vowel <Î> /a:/). This means that the use of the marks that indicate the 
final post-nasalised short vowel and the consonant gemination by 
informants in any of the responses would effectively introduce a new 

2. Data and Methodology 
26 
consonant into the blend, which would then make it unsuitable for analysis 
based on criterion (ii) as discussed in section 2.3.4. The mark of the 
elongated final vowel <Î> /a:/ was used non-finally in a number of the 
source words, also representing the same phoneme /a:/, as in the source 
words Ë¯ÎÏ£ /ma:Ý¦/ âwaterâ and Î­ÎÏ¨Ï³Î© /di:.na:r/ âdinarâ. In such cases, the 
presence or absence of this diacritic makes no difference to the 
pronunciation of the word; in both cases, whether <Î>, or <Î>, it represents 
the same phonemic segment, which is /a:/. 
It was noticeable that a few of the responses from the survey included 
the zero-vowel diacritic VXNÇQ over the final consonant grapheme. When 
word forms appear out of context (for example as isolated words in a 
dictionary), the presence or absence of the zero-vowel diacritic in the final 
position does not signify anything about the pronunciation of the word. 
Hence, when a word form is written with full diacritisation having the 
final consonant grapheme with a zero-vowel diacritic, the pronunciation 
that this word represents is the same as when this diacritic is not used. For 
instance, the Arabic word form meaning âbooksâ in English can be written 
in Arabic in two ways: one as Ë¸ÎËµÎËµÏ, with a final zero-vowel diacritic, and 
another as ÎËµÎËµÏ, with no final zero-vowel diacritic. Both orthographic forms 
represent the same phonological form /ku.tub/, which is the default word-
form when it is used in isolation, which can be found in the main 
headword entry in any Arabic dictionary. Since the presence or absence of 
the VXNÇQ diacritic on a final grapheme reflects no difference in 
pronunciation, responses that had all of their graphemes diacritised except 
for the final one, were counted as fully diacritised.  
Given that the three main diacritics mentioned above represent short 
vowels, they are necessary for indicating the word pattern (or template). 
For the purpose of this work, we need to know the roots and the word 
templates of the responses, as both are bound morphemes essential for 
derivation in Arabic. The root is the consonant skeleton of the word and 
the word template is âa fixed prosodic template with slots for the root 
consonantsâ (Saiegh-Haddad and Henkin-Roitfarb 2014, 9). For instance, 
the root of the word /xubz/ âbreadâ is CCC and the word template is 
CuCC. It is not unusual for different words to have the same word 
template; for instance, the two words /xubz/ âbreadâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ 
(used as stimuli in the data collection) have the same word template 
CuCC. Another example is both words /mak.tab/ âoffice, deskâ, and 
/max.zan/ âstoreâ, which have the same word pattern CaCCaC. The word 
pattern cannot be determined unless full internal diacritisation or 
vowelisation is provided. The absence of the three diacritics obviously 
means that no information is given about the presence and nature of the 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
27 
possible vowels; this also means that, in some cases, it is impossible to be 
certain about the intended number and nature of the syllables in the blend. 
For instance, the written novel blend /dÝ¤bz/ given as a response to the 
word pair /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and /xubz/ âbreadâ does not give any 
information about the vowels to be used in this word, nor about the 
number of syllables, which makes it impossible even to specify the word 
template of the response. 
One last point about diacritics relates to word-final short-vowel 
diacritics. Such diacritics are always case-markers in Arabic, which do not 
form part of the basic word or vocalic template of a word form (whether 
spoken or written) when given in isolation. The informants were asked to 
give their responses without any context; hence, they were neither required 
nor expected to use case markers. Indeed, none of the responses from the 
survey was case-marked, although in the experiment there was one 
response with what appeared to be a case marker; this was ËµÎË¸ÎËµÏ /lub.dÝ¤u/ 
given as a response to the word pair /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ 
âcheeseâ,7F8 where the final /u/ suggests that this is a nominative case.  
In general, whenever respondents wrote diacritics, these diacritics 
mostly represented short vowels that were found in the source words. 
However, there were also a few cases of responses with diacritics 
indicating short vowels not found in the source words or even indicating a 
combination of new short vowels together with short vowels found in the 
source words. An example from the survey dataset of a response 
containing only short vowels coming from either one or both source words 
is the blend /tamr.ban/ given as a response to the word pair /tamr/ âdatesâ 
and /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ. A similar example from the experiment dataset is 
WKHEOHQGÆ«DODj/ given as a response to the word pair /Æ«DOi:b/ âmilkâ and 
/Ýa:j/ âteaâ. There were no responses from the survey involving only new 
short vowels in the novel blend, but an example from the experiment 
dataset of this type of response is the blend /ti.bin/ formed from the word 
pair /tamr/ âdatesâ and /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ, with neither short vowel 
coming from the source words. An example from the survey dataset of 
responses containing a combination of short vowels coming from the 
source words and new vowels is the blend /da.wa.ma:Ý¦/ given as a 
response to the word pair /da.wa:Ý¦/ âmedicationâ and /ma:Ý¦/ âwaterâ, with 
the first /a/ coming from SW1 and the second /a/ a new one. An example 
of this type of response in the experiment dataset is the blend /xa.dÝ¤ubn/ 
given as a response to the word pair /xubz/ âbreadâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ, 
with a new short vowel /a/, and with /u/ coming from SW2. 
The significance of cases with new short vowels used in the novel 
blends relates to the question of whether informants formed blends using 

2. Data and Methodology 
28 
the vocalic templates of the source words, or only part of it, or an entirely 
new pattern. This issue is discussed in Chapter 5. 
It is necessary at this point to describe how the data were refined. Both 
the survey and experiment included several irrelevant or unsuitable 
responses that had the potential to create problems in the analysis. For 
example, some responses did not comply with the instructions given to the 
informants, especially in the online survey where guidance could not be 
offered and instructions were not guaranteed to be followed. Besides, 
several of the responses from the survey contained typographical errors or 
included indirect comments or more than one answer. In the experiment, 
the types of responses that were irrelevant or unsuitable for analysis 
included, for instance, words that violated the phonotactics of Arabic or 
that contained consonants or long vowels not found in either of the source 
words. 
Accordingly, to overcome the potential problems that such cases might 
cause, responses to both survey and experiment were filtered according to 
several criteria that were established by reviewing all of the collected data; 
these filtering criteria are discussed next. 
2.3.4. Filtering of Datasets 
After assessing the whole dataset, the following criteria were applied in 
determining which responses were to be excluded.  
 
i. 
Fully diacritised or vowelised responses that were identical to 
either of the source words (SWs) and which could be seen to be 
homophonous with either one of the source words were excluded 
from the data.  
ii. 
Some responses in the survey contained grapheme-consonants 
that were not found in the source words. No cases of new 
grapheme-vowels were found in the survey data. There were also 
responses in the experiment that contained consonants as well as 
long vowels that were not found in the source words. There were 
also cases of responses from the experiment that contained vowels 
that are not attested or used in Standard Arabic. All such 
responses were excluded from the data. Examples from the 
responses to the survey containing new grapheme-consonants are 
Ï¦ÎÏ Ï£ /mlbn/ and ÎÏ¨ÎÎ /dÝ¤bnt/ given as responses to the word pair 
/dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ, where the grapheme-
consonant <Ï¡> /m/ in the response /mlbn/ and the grapheme-
consonant <Î> /t/ in the response  /dÝ¤bnt/ are not present in either 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
29 
of the source words. There was also an example from the survey 
where the respondent added a new grapheme-consonant forming a 
variant form that differed from the form of the word pairs given as 
stimuli, which were in Standard Arabic. This example is ÏªË´ÏÎÏ¤Ë´Î§ 
[DPDWÞ«DK given as a response to the word pair /xi.ja:r/ 
âcucumberâ and WÞ«DPDWÞ«LP/ âtomatoâ, where the final sequence 
/im/ was replaced by the sequence /ah/ in a case that reflects an 
Iraqi dialect variant of the word WÞ«DPDWÞ«LP/ âtomatoâ. The use 
of this new consonant as well as the uncertainty caused by giving 
such a form, where it is not clear what base form the participant 
was using to create the blend, means that it is impossible to 
consider such a response in the analysis. The following examples 
from the experiment include new grapheme-consonants in the 
responses. Firstly, Î­ÎÏ³Ë¶Î©  /di.ja:r/ was given as a response to the word 
pair /di:.na:r/ âdinarâ and /du:.la:r/ âdollarâ, where the grapheme-
consonant /j/ is not found in either source word. Also Î­ÎÏ§ Ë¸Ï­Ë´Î© 
/daw.na:r/ was given as a response to the word pair /du:.la:r/ 
âdollarâ and /di:.na:r/ âdinarâ, where the grapheme-consonant 
<Ï­>, representing the semi-consonant /w/, is not found in either 
source word. Furthermore, Î©ÎË¸Ï£ /ma:d/ was given as a response to 
the word pair /ma:s/ âdiamondâ and /Ã°a.hab/ âgoldâ, where the 
grapheme-consonant <Î©> /d/ is not found in either source word. 
Finally, Î®Ë´ÎË¸ÏË´ÏË´Î¯ /za.laÝ§.tar/ was given as a response to the word pair 
/zajt/ âoilâ and /zaÝ§.tar/ âthymeâ, where the grapheme-consonant 
<Ë°Ï> /l/ is not found in either source word. Two examples from the 
responses to the experiment contained new long vowels. One 
response to the word pair /zaÝ§.tar/ âthymeâ and /zajt/ âoilâ was 
ÎÏ´ÏË´Î¯ /za.Ý§i:t/, where the long vowel /i:/ that is graphemically 
represented as <Ï±> is not present in either source word. Again,   
Ï­Î©ÎÏ£/ma:.du:/ was given as a response to the word pair /ma:Ý¦/ 
âwaterâ and /da.wa:Ý¦/ âmedicationâ, but the long vowel /u:/ that is 
graphemically represented as <Ï­> is not present in either source 
word. An example of an experiment response that contained 
vowels not found in Arabic is where Î­ÎÏ§Ï­Ë¸Î© /do.na:r/ was given as a 
response to the word pair /du:.la:r/ âdollarâ and /di:.na:r/ âdinarâ, 
where the vowel /o/ that is graphemically represented as <Ï­> is 
not used in Standard Arabic. 
iii. 
Responses that violated rules of spelling (in the survey) or 
phonotactics (in the experiment) were also excluded from the 
data. Some responses from the survey included obvious spelling 
mistakes. This category included responses that were written with 

2. Data and Methodology 
30 
a diacritic where it should not be placed, or which were written as 
a disconnected form where the contributed parts were written with 
a space between them, which is a way of writing that does not 
comply with the spelling rules of Arabic. An example of the 
former type of error was the response Ë¸ÎÏ³Î®Ô¸ÎË¸ÏË´Î¯ /zaÝ§trjt/ to the word 
pair /zaÝ§.tar/ âthymeâ and /zajt/ âoilâ, in which a diacritic is 
placed over the consonant grapheme <Î> /t/ where it does not 
normally appear (see section 2.3.3 for details of diacritic 
placement in Arabic). An example of the latter type of error is the 
response ÏµÏ­Î© Î­ÎÏ¨Ï³Î© /di:.na:r du:.la:/ to the word pair /di:.na:r/ 
âdinarâ and /du:.la:r/ âdollarâ, which was written with a space 
between the full word /di:.na:r/ âdinarâ and the part /du:.la:/ from 
the word /du:.la:r/ âdollarâ. A few cases of responses from the 
experiment did not conform to the ordinary phonotactics of 
Arabic. This category included responses that were produced with 
an initial consonantal cluster. An example of this case was the 
response Ï¢Ë¶ÏÎÏ´Î§ [MDWÞ«LPWRWKHword pair /xi.ja:r/ âcucumberâ and 
WÞ«DPa:.WÞ«LP/ âtomatoâ, where the response begins with an initial 
consonantal cluster /xj/, which is not existing, nor pronounceable 
in Arabic. Similarly, words pronounced as disconnected segments 
were excluded on the basis that they seemed to be produced as 
two-word phrases rather than as a single word. The only example 
of this case in the data was 
  
Î±ÎÎË´Ï«  /hab a:s/ given as a response to 
the word pair /Ã°a.hab/ âgoldâ and /ma:s/ âdiamondâ, where the 
contributed elements from the source words were produced with a 
pause in between. All such responses would have introduced a 
degree of uncertainty into the interpretation of the results; hence, 
they were excluded from the data to be analysed.  
iv. 
Responses that included the whole of both source words (whether 
undiacritised, partially diacritised or fully diacritised), thus in 
effect creating a compound instead of a blend, were excluded 
from the data. Examples from the survey were Î®Ë´ÎË¸ÏË´Î¯ ÎÏ³Ë´Î¯ /zajt 
zaÝ§.tar/ as a response to the word pair /zajt/ âoilâ and /zaÝ§.tar/ 
âthymeâ, and 
ÎË´Ï«Ë´Î«
-
Î±ÎÏ£
 /Ã°a.hab-ma:s/ as a response to the word 
pair /Ã°a.hab/ âgoldâ and /ma:s/ âdiamondâ. Similar examples from 
the experiment were ÎÏ´Ï Ë´Î£Ï±ÎÎ·  /Ýa:j Æ«D.li:b/ as a response to the 
word pair /Ýa:j/ âteaâ and /Æ«D.li:b/ âmilkâ, and Ï¢Ë¶ÏÎÏ¤Ë´ÏÎ­ÎÏ´ Ë¶Î§ 
[LMDUWÞ«DPDWÞ«LP as a response to the word pair /xi.ja:r/ 
âcucumberâ and WÞ«DPDWÞ«LP/ âtomatoâ. 
v. 
Responses that included both source words linked by a 
coordinator or preposition were also excluded. Examples from the 

Blending, from English to Arabic

survey included /tamr wa la.ban/ âdates and yoghurtâ as a 
response to the word pair /tamr/ âdatesâ and /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ, 
where /wa/ âandâ is used as a coordinator, and /xubz bi dÝ¤ubn/ 
âbread with cheeseâ as a response to the word pair /xubz/ âbreadâ 
and /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ, where the preposition /bi/ âwithâ has been 
added.9 No responses of this type were found in the data from the 
experiment. 
vi. 
All indirect or tangential responses and comments in the Survey 
and Experiment were excluded. These included responses other 
than a potential answer such as words like yes or no given in 
Arabic or English or full sentences like I do not know also in 
Arabic or English, or a sequence of letters such as <aaaaa> or 
<ttttt> in Arabic, or symbols such as a question mark or an X 
mark. 
vii. 
Although the informants were asked to give only one answer to 
each word pair, the data included several responses where the 
informants gave two invented blends for a given word pair. For 
any response in either method of data collection that included two 
answers, only the first was considered for analysis. 
viii. 
As pointed out above, one case-marked response was found in the 
whole dataset. That was ËµÎË¸ÎËµÏ /lub.dÝ¤u/ given in the experiment as a 
response to the word pair /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ. 
This response contains the short vowel /u/ word-finally, which 
could be taken to indicate that the form is in the nominative case, 
although without any surrounding context. There is no way of 
determining if this is what the participant intended, particularly 
when we consider that the /dÝ¤u-/ part of /dÝ¤ubn/ also has this 
vowel. However, this was the only response of this kind in the 
whole dataset, and therefore cannot be used as a basis for the 
analysis of case-marked responses.  
 
As a result of applying this set of filtering criteria, 154 (13.58%) 
responses from the survey were excluded, leaving a total of 980 (86.42%) 
responses in the dataset used for analysis, and 73 (12.67%) responses from 
the experiment were excluded, leaving a total of 503 (87.33%) responses 
in the dataset used for analysis. Table 2.5 and Table 2.6 below summarise 
the types and numbers of responses excluded from the survey and the 
experiment, respectively, according to the various filtering criteria listed 
above. The Roman numerals given after the response types in the left-hand 
column refer to the filtering criteria. In both tables, the total number of 
unsuitable responses in the various categories is given first. Two numbers

responses out of the total number of excluded responses.

The responses from the survey (980 responses) that passed the filtering 
criteria showed some variability in the way in which the respondents typed 
their answers. Only 59 responses (6%) were fully diacritised, with 69 (7%) 
being partially diacritised, and 852 (87%) undiacritised.  
Full details of the number of fully, partially and undiacritised 
responses from the survey are presented in Table 2.7 below. For each 
category of responses, the total number is given first. Two numbers in 
parentheses follow this number. These two numbers indicate the number 
of responses given in answer to the first list of word pairs and then the 
number of responses given in answer to the subsequent list of the same 
word pairs with reversed ordering. All these numbers are followed by 
percentages indicating the proportion of these responses out of the total 
number of responses.

Concerning the experiment, it was perhaps surprising that even though this 
involved spoken responses, there were responses that included cases of 
illicit consonant clusters. In these cases, the respondents appeared to 
intentionally, albeit with some difficulty, be not producing some vowels 
where they should. The two cases of such responses were: Î­ÎÏ´Ë¸Ï WÞ«MDU
JLYHQWRWKHZRUGSDLUWÞ«DPa:.WÞ«LPâtomatoâ and /xi.ja:r/ âcucumberâ, and

/WÞ«DPa:.WÞ«LPâtomatoâ. Both were excluded from the analysis because they 
violated the phonotactic rules of Arabic (filtering criterion (iii)). This 
leaves 503 responses that constitute the data to be analysed from the 
experiment. 

3. BLENDING IN ENGLISH 
 
 
 
3.1. Introduction 
This chapter discusses blending and blends in English. Section 3.2 
presents a brief background on blending within two main theoretical 
frameworks: Generative Grammar (GG) and Optimality Theory (OT). 
Section 3.3 is a discussion of major issues related to the definition, 
classification and form of blends. Section 3.4 considers whether and in 
what sense blending can be considered a productive process for forming 
new words. Section 3.5 presents some linguistic studies on English blends 
and discusses several tendencies identified based on the most investigated 
features of blends. Section 3.6 is a summary of blend-formation tendencies 
in English that constitute the focus of this book.  
3.2. Theoretical Background on Blending in English 
This section presents a brief discussion of blending within two main 
theoretical frameworks, namely Generative Grammar (GG) and Optimality 
Theory (OT), with a focus on their accounts of English word-formation. 
The discussion also sheds the light on the justifications for classifying 
blending as an extragrammatical phenomenon rather than as a grammatical 
process. 
Aronoff (1976, 46-86) âdeveloped the notion of a Word Formation 
Rule as an operation on a base, accompanied by various conditions on the 
baseâ. Although Aronoff (1976, 46-86) discusses these word-formation 
rules (WFRs) in terms of the syntax, semantics, morphology and 
phonology of words produced by such rules, there is no reference to 
blending as a word-formation process within the Generative framework 
that he adopts. This could be a consequence of his view of WFRs âas an 
operation on a baseâ or because blending is not considered a grammatical 
morphological process, but rather as an extragrammatical morphological 
process. The WFRs that Aronoff (1976)  refers to cannot describe the 
formation of blends probably because he (1976, 21) states that, although 
blends are derived from other words, they are not transparent, i.e. there is a 
lack of semantic transparency in the parts of the blend, referred to in this 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
35 
book by the term âfracto-lexemesâ. Similarly, Cannon (1986, 748) states 
that the diverse and numerous patterns that English blends exhibit cannot 
be generated within the traditional framework of generative rules. 
Mattiello (2013, 21) confirms this view stating that blends, being 
extragrammatical formations, âare mainly based on analogical patternsâ 
that âdo not generally change the denotative meaning of the input, but only 
express a certain attitude on the part of the speakerâ, hence they are 
âirrelevant within the generative approach to word-formationâ. 
Accordingly, WFRs cannot generate blends in the same way a 
paradigm is generated by adding affixes to a base, where the affixes are 
semantically transparent, as well as the base. Hence, the creation of new 
blends is not a matter of formation rules, but rather of tendencies, patterns, 
and/or constraints. This is the view adopted and argued for in this book.  
Another broadly similar account is that of McCarthy and Prince (1996) 
who discuss word-formation rules in the context of prosodic morphology 
and the framework of an Optimality Theory approach. Although the 
notions of prosodic morphology and OT constraints can be applied to 
English blend structures (see the discussion of Bat-EL and Cohen (2012) 
in section 3.5.3). McCarthy and Prince (1996) do not discuss blends, 
focusing instead on affixation and compounding as examples of word-
formation processes.  
 While blending is not described as a word-formation process within 
these two frameworks of Generative Grammar and Optimality Theory, this 
word-formation phenomenon has been investigated thoroughly, whether as 
a constraint-governed and hence predictable process or as a matter of 
âunusual coinagesâ and âodditiesâ (Aronoff 1976, 20). Aronoffâs (Aronoff 
1976, 18-19); (1983, 165)) framework states that a word-formation rule is 
âa directional device which forms potential words from actual wordsâ. 
These potential words are formed using complex morphological patterns, 
which Aronoff (1983, 165) calls word-formation patterns, and these 
patterns are subcategories of the output of a word-formation rule. What is 
interesting about the distinction between these patterns and the rules is that 
productivity is a property of the former, and not the latter (Aronoff 1983, 
165). 
Although unpredictability is a feature of blending in the sense that 
âthere is no transparent analysis into morphsâ, the word-formation rules of 
a given language allow for an amount of predictability as to which forms 
can be candidate blends (Bauer 1983, 234). Referring to a number of these 
rules, Bauer (1983, 234-5) explains why, for instance, dawk < dove + 
hawk wins over several other potential blend formations. These rules 
would preclude some formations from candidacy because of lexical 

3. Blending in English 
36 
blocking, like /dà­k/ and /hà­k/, or because of the unusual pattern of fracto-
lexemes, like /dÜ§v/ and /hà­k/, where neither is of the usual pattern AD < 
AB + CD, or because the orthographic representation of the blend would 
introduce a pronunciation that does not refer to the original sounds, like 
/hà­v/ which could be spelt as hove, hence be re-pronounced as /hÔ¥uv/. 
Recently, Bauer (2012) has reconsidered the analysis of blends. He 
argues (2012, 14-19) that there are regularities and constraints involved in 
blending, and he makes a distinction between the core and the periphery, 
where the core refers to prototypical categories of blends and the periphery 
to less prototypical categories. Bauer (2012, 11) suggests that rather than 
being âcut-and-dried categoriesâ, blends should be conceived in terms of 
more or less âprototypical or canonical categoriesâ. Accordingly, no 
criteria can say that a word is a blend or not, but there are âdefeasible 
constraintsâ on blend formation, âwhich may or may not be met in 
individual casesâ, meaning that these constraints may have counter-
examples (Bauer 2012, 11-12, 14).  
Bauer (2012, 14-17) lists nine of these blend-formation constraints: 
 
1) âthe longest base word sets up a maximum length for the blendâ,  
2) the contributed parts in a polysyllabic blend should be each at least 
one syllable long,  
3) the stressed syllable from at least one of the two bases (or maybe 
both) is retained in the blend, with a preference for the stress 
pattern of the second base to be retained,  
4) both base words must undergo deletion,  
5) when the first part of the blend ends with a consonant and the 
second begins with a consonant, the second consonant is less 
sonorant than the first,  
6) a blend âmust meet all relevant phonotactic requirementsâ,  
7) a monosyllabic blend is formed from a syllable onset from the first 
base and a syllable rhyme from the second,  
8) any common phoneme(s)/letter(s) between the two base words 
result in an overlap âthat defines the crossover pointâ, and 
9) the breakpoint in a blend occurs âat a syllable break or, failing that, 
at an onset/rhyme breakâ. 
 
More recently, Bauer, Lieber and Plag (2013, 462) have argued that 
âblends are a productive word-formation process in English which, despite 
the considerable variability, conforms to some general principles and 
tendencies that highly restrict the structure of possible formationsâ. 
 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
37 
On the same track, Plag (2003, 13, 17, 129) classifies blending as a 
ânon-concatenativeâ, ânon-affixational derivationalâ process of word 
formation in which, âin spite of the initial impression of irregularity, a 
whole range of systematic structural restrictions can be determinedâ. 
Nevertheless, although blends have been described as predictable and 
regular ((Lehrer 2003); (Gries 2004a); (Gries 2004b); (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012); (Bauer 2012)), it is apparent that they âare not completely 
predictableâ, hence showing âdifferent degrees of opacityâ (Mattiello 
2013, 33). 
The change in the position of some scholars, concerning their view of 
the nature of blending as a linguistic phenomenon, can be related to the 
classification of the process as an âextra-grammaticalâ mechanism 
((Dressler 2000); (Ronneberger-Sibold 2006); (Mattiello 2013)) of âword 
creationâ (Ronneberger-Sibold 2010), as opposed to considering it a 
regular and productive phenomenon of word formation ((Arndt-Lappe and 
Plag 2013); (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013)). 
The structure of words is governed either by a set of constraints and 
patterns or by a set of rules (Dressler 2000). The former set falls within a 
module of morphology called âextragrammatical morphologyâ, also 
referred to by Zwicky and Pullum (1987) as âexpressive morphologyâ, 
while the latter falls within a module called âmorphological grammarâ 
(Dressler 2000, 1). Since blending is a process that has no fixed rules, but 
rather constraints, patterns and/or tendencies, it is better classified as an 
extragrammatical morphological operation (EMO) (Dressler 2000, 2).  
Two reasons are taken into consideration for excluding blending from 
grammatical morphology: one relates to the morphotactics of the blends 
and the other to their semantics ((Dressler 2000); (Mattiello 2013)). 
Morphological rules produce âunconsciousâ and âpotential wordsâ and 
require âmeaning changeâ (Dressler 2000, 4). Most blends âdo not occur 
in unconscious, productive new formationsâ, and, therefore, âcannot be 
defined as potential wordsâ (Dressler 2000, 4-5). It is also the case that 
most blends do not have a meaning that is different from the meanings of 
their source words (Mattiello 2013, 21). Consequently, blends are not 
morphologically rule-governed. 
Additionally, âmorphotactic devices for forming blendsâ are âmuch less 
regularâ than, for instance, those of âgrammatical compound formationsâ 
(Dressler 2000, 5). This indicates that the blendsâ âfinal segmental make-up 
is often unpredictableâ, which leads to having merely preferences and not 
rules (Dressler 2000, 5). This feature made some morphologists (such as 
Bauer (1983, 234-237) and Rainer (1993, 87-90)) âexclude blending from 
morphological grammarâ ((Dressler 2000, 5); (Mattiello 2013, 33)).  

3. Blending in English 
38 
Moreover, some fracto-lexemes that are repeatedly used in blending 
are not reinterpreted, but simply undergo abbreviation, which âshould be 
kept distinct from âsecretionâ, involving reinterpretation of linguistic 
unitsâ (Mattiello 2013, 34). This process of âabbreviation confines blends 
to extra-grammaticality, typically characterised by the difficulty to predict 
the output given an inputâ (Mattiello 2013, 34). 
Blending qualifies as extragrammatical because âit includes properties 
which do not match the grammar of the language in question, or [â¦] lacks 
properties regularly associated with processes of similar typeâ and âit may 
include processes which are not present elsewhere in the morphology of 
the language in questionâ; moreover, blends being âconscious creationsâ is 
a fact that âhas been given as an additional argument in favour of 
considering them extragrammaticalâ (Ronneberger-Sibold 2010, 390-1).  
Nevertheless, Arndt-Lappe and Plag (2013) found that there is a set of 
constraints that determine the structure of blends, therefore making them 
predictable, and hence regular. This takes us back to the hypothesis, 
presented in Arndt-Lappe and Plagâs (2013) study, that the final structure 
of the blend is determined, or predicted, by phonological rules that relate 
to the stress properties of the two bases in the blend and determine âthe 
length of the blend, the location of the switchpoint, and the stress of the 
blendâ (Arndt-Lappe and Plag 2013, 537). Whatever position is taken in 
this debate on the nature of blendingâwhether it is seen as predictable or 
unpredictable, regular or irregularâit is always the case that there are 
counterexamples. Blending has been thought to be irregular and 
unpredictable ((Bauer 1983, 225); (Marchand 1969)), although with the 
acceptance that there is a degree of regularity and predictability in some 
blends. On the other hand, blending has been recently viewed as regular 
and predictable (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 460), although there are 
clear cases of blends that do not follow regular patterns of formation. 
This book agrees with the hypothesis that prosodic morphology 
explains the process of blending. This means that blending is manipulated 
by prosodic constituents rather than by the agglutination of morphemes 
and, therefore, that the phonological form of the output relies on the 
prosodic categories. This approach has been successful in accounting for 
the phonological properties of blends.10 Additionally, statistical and 
computational approaches have supported and added to results arrived at 
by the constraint-based approaches of prosodic morphology, with the 
properties of blends successfully modelled, quantitatively and computationally 
(Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 460) (Statistical and computational studies 
include, but are not limited to, Cook and Stevenson (2010), and Gries 
(2012).

3.3. Definition and Form-Related Issues 
Two issues that relate to the variation in the structural patterns of blends 
are discussed in this section: the definition (broad or narrow) of the blends 
based on their structure, and, based on the definition of blends, the 
criterion for differentiating blends from clipped compounds.  
The general, broad definition of blending tends to include word forms 
that can belong to other processes of word formation: two words are joined 
in a way where at least one undergoes truncation. Bauer (1983, 236) states 
that since there are various types of blends whose analysis can be 
perceived differently by the hearers, blending tends to shade off into many 
processes of word formation, particularly that of compounding; this 
process, in particular, shares many features with blending and 
consequently causes confusion as to whether a given word form is to be 
labelled a blend or a clipped compound.  
Of course, in contrast, a narrow definition of blends would restrict the 
membership of this process to specific word forms that are formed 
according to a more restrictive set of criteria. Bat-El (2006, 66) adopts a 
formal criterion according to which she restricts blends to certain 
formations. Forms in which the right edges of the source words are 
truncated (hence having the structural pattern AC), such as sitcom < 
situation and comedy, modem < modulator and demodulator, and fortran < 
formula and translation, are classified as clipped compounds, rather than 
blends. Additionally, blends in which only the first word undergoes 
truncation (hence having the structural pattern AW) would also be 
considered a clipped compound, e.g. mocamp < motor and camp, 
especially when each word contributes only one syllable to the surface 
form, which is a characteristic of clipped compounds (Bat-El 2006). 
In addition to these structural considerations, Bat-El (2006, 67) also 
distinguishes blends from clipped compounds based on lexical categories 
and semantic characteristics: blends allow any possible combination of 
lexical categories, including some that do not appear in compounds, e.g. 
verb-verb, as in baffound < baffle and confound; moreover, blends do not 
show a preference for endocentric or exocentric relation, whereas 
compounds are mostly endocentric. 
For Bat-El (2006, 67) , the formation of a blend involves two 
competing goals. On the one hand, it must have the structure of a single 
word, unlike compounds, in which the two base words are accessible. 
Consequently, the blend often adopts the number of syllables in one of its 
base words, thus truncating some segmental material (Bat-El 2006, 67) . 
On the other hand, in apparent competition with this, a blend must 

3. Blending in English 
40 
preserve as much of the structure from its base words as possible (Bat-El 
2006, 67). 
On the same track, Gries (2006) and Bauer, Lieber and Plag (2013) 
differentiate between the AC and AD formations, stating that they follow 
different structural requirements. On this basis, AC formations are often 
treated as a pattern distinct from blending and referred to as âclipped 
compoundsâ (Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013) or âcomplex clippingsâ (Gries 
2006). Clipped compounds (AC formations) systematically preserve much 
less material than AD formations and overlaps of segmental material are 
less common in clipped compounds (Arndt-Lappe and Plag 2013, 540-1). 
Although Arndt-Lappe and Plag (2013, 541) consider AD formations as 
including both blends and clipped compounds together, they state that 
there are differences regarding their base words: while the bases of AD 
blends tend to be orthographically and phonologically highly similar to 
each other, clipped compound bases are significantly less similar to each 
other (Arndt-Lappe and Plag 2013, 541). 
For Bauer, Lieber and Plag (2013, 458) a blend is originally a 
compound. They define a blend as a compound that has undergone a 
phonological loss in at least one of the constituents and behaves 
semantically as any compound, though it adopts the stress pattern of a 
single word, normally that of one of the constituents. Yet a certain amount 
of uncertainty about the nature of blending is reflected in the fact that 
Bauer, Lieber and Plag (2013, 458) nevertheless acknowledge that this 
phenomenon is not yet clearly defined. There has been no specific 
determination in Bauer, Lieber and Plagâs (2013) discussion of the 
boundaries of what is referred to as a blend.  
One problem is the formal features of what to be called a blend. Bauer, 
Lieber and Plag (2013, 458) distinguish between words where medial 
segmental material is lost, e.g. brunch, and others where both bases lose 
their final material, e.g. modem. While referring to the first of these 
examples as a blend and the second as a clipped compound, this 
distinction can be a counter-example for Bauer, Lieber and Plagâs (2013, 
458) definition cited in the previous paragraph. Since they refer to the 
blend as a compound, there is no reason why they cannot still classify both 
words as blends. 
Despite this potential confusion in the use of the terms, Bauer, Lieber 
and Plag (2013, 458) do propose a formula for the structure of each 
subtype. A blend follows the formula AB+CD o AD, whereas a clipped 
compound follows the formula AB+CD o AC. Based on the distinction 
between these two subtypes, Bauer, Lieber and Plag (2013, 458) justify 
classifying them as two distinct processes. Clipped compounds are 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
41 
different from blends in the following features: 
 
- the former preserve much less material than the latter and they do 
this in a systematic pattern; 
- the former show underrepresentation regarding the overlap of 
segmental material;  
- base words of the former are less similar to each other than those of 
the latter, which show high orthographic and phonological 
similarity; and  
- the former is a less productive process than the latter. 
 
Mattiello (2013, 60) suggests that blending, being âan extra-grammatical 
subtractive operationâ, âmay delete larger and not necessarily non-salient 
partsâ of the base words, as in, for instance, sitcom < situation comedy, 
modem < modulator + demodulator, ginormous < gigantic + enormous, 
and ambisextrous < ambidextrous + sex. Furthermore, what makes blends 
different from clipped compounds, such as hi-fi < high fidelity and adman 
< advertising man, is that the bases of the latter have a composite rather 
than independent meaning (Mattiello 2013, 70). 
To sum up, blending, as a rich source of new words, may share with 
other sources of words some formal and semantic features, depending on 
how blending is defined. The broader the definition of blending is, the 
more inclusive it will be of word forms formed by other processes simply 
because they have similar features, as is the case with the definition by 
Bauer, Lieber and Plag (2013). Similarly, the narrower the definition is, 
the less inclusive it will be, as is the case with the definition by Bat-El 
(2006). 
3.4. A View on the Productivity of Blending 
This section addresses the question of whether or not blending is a 
productive process.  
Blending is mostly defined as âa productive processâ whereby new 
words are formed by joining parts from other words ((Bauer 1983, 236); 
(LÃ³pez RÃºa 2012, 23); (Ralli and Xydopoulos 2012, 47)), and it has been 
described as an extra-grammatical process (Mattiello 2013, 4) which has 
no rules (Gries 2012, 146) but rather constraints (Bauer 2012, 11), or 
patterns and tendencies (section 3.5).  
The concept of productivity has been viewed differently by scholars as 
to the scope it covers. Some scholars describe productivity as a property of 
processes ((Uhlenbeck 1978, 4); (Anderson 1982, 585); (Bauer 2001, 13)), 

3. Blending in English 
42 
while others describe it as a property of rules ((Aronoff 1976, 36); 
(Zwanenburg 1980, 248)). Moreover, the general definition of productivity 
has been only applied to derivational processes like affixation ((Bauer 
1983); (Bauer 2001); (Plag, Dalton-Puffer and Baayen 1999)). 
Moreover, Bauer (1983, 97)  states that âproductivity is not so much an 
either/or phenomenon as a clineâ and that â[S]ome processes are more 
productive than othersâ. This statement has been confirmed by Plag, 
Dalton-Puffer and Baayen (1999, 11-12) who states that âproductivity is a 
gradual phenomenon, which means that morphological processes are 
either more or less productive than othersâ, and by Dressler (2000, 463) 
who states that there is âgradualness in the degrees of productivity in 
morphologyâ. In practice, the notion of productivity is usually applied to 
affixes only, partly because of the great influence of Baayenâs (1991)  
work on measuring productivity, which is based on a methodology that is 
very well suited to affixation, but not to other methods of making new 
words, such as compounding, clipping, and blending.  
Baayen (1991, 124) developed âtwo complementary techniques for 
evaluating the global productivity of word formation processesâ both were 
obtained by focusing âon the growth curve of the vocabularyâ. To evaluate 
the 
productivity 
of 
a 
word-formation 
process, 
namely 
derivation/affixation, Baayen (1991, 124-5) considered jointly the degree 
of productivity and the extent of use of vocabulary based on 1) frequency 
by counting âthe number of tokens, the number of types and the number of 
the hapaxes in the item sampleâ, and 2) on pragmatic potentiality by 
obtaining âa single explicit ranking by means of the index of pragmatic 
potentialityâ. Accordingly, the extent to which a morphological category, 
for instance, affixation, is productive may also be evaluated by considering 
the extent to which the number of potential types exceeds the number of 
observed types. However, this perspective of productivity does not apply 
to the process of blending (Baayen 1991, 124-5). 
For Bauer (2001, 13), it is best to view productivity as a property of 
processes, not of words or word parts. For instance, in a word like sayable, 
what is productive is the process of adding -able to a verb to form an 
adjective. However, Dressler (2008, 457) argues that â[P]roductive 
morphological patterns are [â¦] considered to be those that freely apply to 
new wordsâ¦â. In this case, it can also be argued that blending patterns 
and tendencies can also be applied to new blends, which could make them 
productive.  
Although the productivity of blending as a process would be hard to 
measure using Baayenâs (2009) methods, there are two signs that blending 
is a relatively productive process (in English as it has been shown in 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
43 
scholarly statistical research on blending, and in Arabic as the preliminary 
results of this book show in section 5.3): (1) the sheer number of blends 
that exist, and (2) the relative ease with which speakers can make a blend 
out of two words when asked to do so.  
Since âit is unclear how the fact that a blend is lexicalised affects the 
question of how well its structure reflects productive mechanismsâ, it is 
assumed with any research on productivity that âproductive mechanisms 
are best investigated in rare formations rather than in frequent formationsâ 
((Baayen 1992); (Baayen 1993); (Plag 1999)). This hypothesis can be 
confirmed by the results that are arrived at in this book, where the rare 
formations found in the data analysed show that some patterns of blends 
can be productive since the blenders can form novel blends following 
these patterns (section 5.3.1.1.iii). 
However, Bauer (2001, 22) states that â[M]ost linguists also wish to 
exclude some general patterns of word-making from the domain of 
productivityâ as well as âwords which are intentionally coined, leaving 
only such words as are automatically coined without speakers or hearers 
necessarily being aware of themâ, which would, in particular, exclude 
blends.  
Nevertheless, Mattiello (2013) has another viewpoint on the 
productivity of blending. She (2013, 19, 22, 30) states that blending, an 
extra-grammatical, non-rule-governed, phenomenon, is an analogical 
process and that blends are formations that âare based on creativity and 
analogy rather than on productivity rulesâ. She (2013, 20) also states that 
â[A]lthough there are some principles and regularities in the production of 
blends [â¦], these regularities are not productive rules, in the sense that 
[â¦] they do not allow full prediction of a regular outputâ. Moreover, 
â[T]he analogical principle governing their formation is indeed more 
permissive than rules [â¦]â (Mattiello 2013, 20, 251). Accordingly, extra-
grammatical processes are expected to be unproductive (Mattiello 2013, 
38). 
In Mattielloâs (2013) approach, the process of making a blend with a 
specific fracto-lexeme is, by definition, not productive. What can be 
productive is the process of making blends in general. Nevertheless, 
considering any specific fracto-lexeme productive is problematic because 
that would imply there is a productive process of using it to make blends, 
whereas they are frequently used and on the way to becoming 
morphemised, hence cannot be considered fracto-lexemes but rather 
âsplintersâ (Mattiello 2013, 34). 
Mattiello (2013, 34) argues that a form like -holic (as in foodaholic, 
workoholic) has undergone a âsecretion processâ, hence become a 

3. Blending in English 
44 
âsecreted combining formâ, which makes it lose âits connection with the 
source word alcoholic and can be considered as a morpheme in its own 
rightâ. These secreted combining forms âattach to other bases to obtain 
new words; however [â¦] they discard certain semantic elements from 
their source words: for instance, a sugarholic is âa person addicted to 
sugarâ, but has nothing to do with âalcoholâ (Mattiello 2013, 35-6).  
Mattiello (2013) distinguishes between productivity and creativity. She 
(2013, 48) defines âproductivity as that property of language which allows 
a native speaker to create new words in a rule-governed wayâ, whereas she 
defines creativity as âthe native speakerâs ability to extend the language 
system in a motivated, but unpredictable (non-rule-governed) wayâ.  
Moreover, Mattiello (2013, 48) agrees with the statement that 
productivity âis a gradual phenomenon ranging from unproductive to fully 
productiveâ; whereas she (2013, 48) describes creativity as being âan 
absolute phenomenon, with no intermediate degreesâ; which is âeither a 
morphological formation is obtained creatively or it is notâ. While 
âproductivity coins new words by exploiting word-formation rules, 
creativity coins new words by considering both rules and analogical 
patternsâ (Mattiello 2013, 48).  
Consequently, âwords coined by using word-formation rules are 
entirely predictable, while words exploiting analogical patterns are only 
partially soâ (Mattiello 2013, 49). According to Mattiello (2013, 49), 
âthose new words which are formed regularly [â¦] become established as 
part of the norm [â¦] whereas those which are formed creatively may fail 
to become part of the normâ, which makes it âclear that productivity is 
irrelevant as a criterion for predicting neologisms, which can also be 
obtained through creativity (Mattiello 2013, 49). Hence, âextra-
grammatical formations offer the language user the potential to produce 
new words, but this potential is a matter of availability rather than of 
actual profitabilityâ (Mattiello 2013, 49). 
Mattiello confirms that â[E]xtra-grammatical processes must be 
necessarily included in the realm of creativityâ because âthey are only to 
some extent predictable by means of analogyâ and not âcontrolled by 
productive generative-like rulesâ. Accordingly, the underlying mechanismsâ 
of âextra-grammatical morphological formationsâ are ânot productive 
word formation rules, but analogical patterns obtained from morphological 
structures already in use elsewhereâ (Mattiello 2013, 53). 
Mattiello (2013, 117) claims that secreted forms are âregular and 
therefore grammatical, although marginal in morphologyâ and that they 
have âacquired morpheme status, and cannot be viewed as part of a 
blendâ. Moreover, it can be said that these forms are moderately 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
45 
productive, which is why they cannot be considered as bound morphemes; 
however, if they become more productive, they can become free, in which 
case, they cannot be considered as representatives of bases in blends 
(Bauer, Lieber and Plag 2013, 525). 
To sum up, from a general perspective, blending is described as a 
productive word-formation process since new blends are frequently 
formed and could be lexicalised, and from a specific perspective, blending 
is described as creative since it makes use of analogical patterns but at the 
same time, the newly formed blends might not be lexicalised. 
The following section outlines the blend-formation features and tendencies 
for which there is good supporting evidence in the literature on blending in 
English. 
3.5. English Blend-Formation Features and Tendencies  
The structural characteristics of blends can be affected by several features. 
These play a role in determining the final shape of a blend and help 
explain why it has this particular form and not another. 
A major focus of recent research has been on the prosodic structure of 
blends and how it is determined by the prosodic structure of the source 
words. Studying the prosodic structure of the blend includes identifying 
the degree of shortening that source words undergo and their contribution 
to the blend. These investigations, which focus on both established and 
novel blends, have identified several blend-formation tendencies or 
patterns; hence making it possible to determine the structure of a blend 
based on the structure of the corresponding source words.  
Among the observations that BergstrÃ¶m (1906, 46) first made on 
blending, which were later elaborated upon by many scholars, he 
mentioned two factors as having a role in the formation of âword-
blendingsâ: stress and syllabic-boundary limits. Although BergstrÃ¶m 
(1906, 46) stated that his observations were ânot very instructiveâ, he 
thought âthat in the blending the stress is generally kept on a vowel 
stressed in one of the parent-words [â¦], [and] that the limit between 
syllables [â¦] generally marks the limit in the blendingsâ. It appears that 
stress patterns and cut-off points in source words, as well as, in recent 
investigations, the amount or the proportional contribution of source words 
to the blend, play central roles in determining the structure of English 
blends.   
This section focuses on these three major prosodic features that were 
first referred to by BergstrÃ¶m (1906) and which have been further 
investigated since then. These are: (1) the cut-off points in the source 

3. Blending in English 
46 
words; (2) the proportional contributions from source words to blends; and 
(3) the stress patterns of the blend.  
3.5.1. Cut-off Points in Source Words 
The following chronological overview of the literature focuses on previous 
studies that have identified the cut-off point as one of the dominant factors 
in shaping the final structure of the blend. 
Cannon (1986, 742) analysed a set of blends to find out where the cut-
off points occur in the source words. His corpus included 132 written 
English blends: 118 nouns, 11 adjectives, and 3 verbs, compiled from The 
Barnhart Dictionary of New English since 1963 (1973), The Second 
Barnhart Dictionary of New English (1980), and Merriamâs 9,000 Words 
(1983). 
In his analysis of this corpus, Cannon (1986, 726) found that in 90 
blends the âfusing pointsâ came at: 
(a) a syllabic boundary, as in ausform (austenitic + deform), (b) a 
morphemic one, as in alphametic (alphabet + arithmetic), which almost 
invariably comes at a syllabic boundary; and (c) a nonboundary, as in 
cystathionine (cysteine + methionine), where a linking /a/ replaces a vowel 
in order to create a new syllable, or in splanch (split-level + ranch), where 
a new monosyllable is created.11  
The first type of example has the cut-off point occur at a syllable 
boundary (ausform < austenitic and deform), and the second type has the 
cut-off point occur between two morphemes (alphametic < alphabet and 
arithmetic). It seems that Cannon (1986, 742) is interested only in the 
distinction âat a syllable boundaryâ versus ânot at a syllable boundaryâ, as 
is the case in the third type of cut-off point, where he (1986, 742)  just 
calls it âa nonboundaryâ fusing point without indicating specifically where 
it occurs. This type should be further analysed in terms of where within the 
syllable the cut-off point occurs. So, in cystathionine < cyst|eine and 
me|thionine, the cut-off point in the first source word occurs between the 
onset and the nucleus of the second syllable, while in splanch < spl|it-level 
and r|anch, the cut-off points occur between the onset and nucleus in both 
source words.  
In the second type, in (b) above, although the example that is given 
shows that the cut-off point occurs at morphemic boundaries, Cannon 
(1986, 742) still mentions that it âalmost invariably comes at a syllabic 
boundaryâ, and it is, therefore, unclear why he does not simply group this 
along with the first type of blend that he describes in (a). 
Although Cannon (1986) states that cut-off points occur at syllabic 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
47 
boundaries, without referring to where the cut-off points occur within 
syllables, the types of cut-off points he identified reflect a tendency for 
cut-off points to occur at, in addition to syllable boundaries, within-
syllable breaks, especially between the onset and nucleus. 
There is some variation in the ways that fracto-lexemes can be joined 
at the split point in a blend. Cannon (1986) analysed in detail what 
happens at and/or around the split point of his 132 blends. There are two 
basic modes of fusion: one with and the other without overlapping sounds 
or letters.  
In cases with overlapping sounds or letters, Cannon (1986, 742) 
identified four patterns. The first involves the truncation of both source 
words while retaining one shared letter whose pronunciation is taken from 
one of the source words, as in the blend Dixican < Dixi|e ÞGÜ¼ksi/ and 
Republ|ican /rà±¾ÞpÝblà±¾k(Ô¥)n/ where the letter <i> is found in both source 
words but takes its pronunciation (/i/) from the <ie> of the first source 
word.12 There are also cases of blends where the letter retained in the 
blend has the same pronunciation in both source words, as in fantabulous 
< fanta|stic and f|abulous, where the letter <a> has the same 
pronunciation in both source words (Cannon 1986, 742).  
The second pattern involves the blend retaining both of the source 
words in full while also having one or more shared letters that are found in 
both source words, as in the blend glassteel < glass and steel, where both 
words are retained with a shared <s>, and autopia < auto and utopia, 
where both words are retained with three shared letters <uto>, although 
the pronunciation of the shared <u> comes from the <au> of auto and not 
from utopia. 
The third pattern involves retaining the whole of the second source 
word and truncating the first source word with a shared segment of letters, 
as in the blend biathlete < biathl|on and athlete. The Oxford English 
Dictionary Online (1996) gives the etymology of this word as follows: 
biathlete < biathl- (in biathlon n.) + ete (in athlete n.), which means that 
the analysis of such cases can vary. This book adheres to Kaunistoâs 
(2013, 4) viewpoint of considering such cases as having shared elements 
simply because one cannot exactly decide which source word is the 
contributor of such elements, especially when measuring the proportional 
contributions from source words to blends. Additionally, these elements 
facilitate the recognition of both source words and hence help to make the 
meaning of the blend transparent.  
The fourth pattern involves retaining the whole of the first source word 
and truncating the second with a shared letter, as in the blend beefalo < 
beef and buf|falo. 

3. Blending in English 
48 
 
Concerning cases of fusion without overlapping, two patterns were 
identified: a fusion either at a syllabic juncture or one which changes the 
syllabic juncture (Cannon 1986, 74). In the former, the original 
syllabification of the fracto-lexemes is preserved in the blend, as in 
stagflation < stag|nation and in|flation where the fusion occurs at a 
consonantal juncture, and in parafoil < para|chute and air|foil where the 
fusion occurs at a vowel-consonant juncture. In these cases, the syllabic 
structure of the fracto-lexemes is maintained (Cannon 1986, 743). Other 
examples of this pattern given by Cannon (1986, 743) are the blends 
psytocracy < psy|chological and au|tocracy, radionics < radi|ation and 
electr|onics, and Dexedrine < dex|tro-amphetamine and Benz|edrine. 
In the second type of fusion pattern, one or both of the fracto-lexemes 
undergo resyllabification, as in the blends linar < lin|e and st|ar, varactor 
< var|ying and re|actor, ecdysone < ecdys|is and horm|one, and neuristor 
< neur|on and trans|istor. A rather special example with resyllabification 
is the blend etorphine < et|her and m|orphine, which quite unusually 
involves consonant-quality change. In this blend, the letter <t> from the 
first source word is retained due to the cut-off point occurring between the 
two graphemes <t> and <h>, which represent the sound È This changes 
the È of the source word into /t/ in the blend, where it becomes the initial 
consonant of the new syllable tor- (Cannon 1986, 743).  
Cannon (1986) found that there is a preference in one or both source 
words, with or without overlapping, for the cut-off point to occur at a 
phonological boundary, meaning syllable, onset and rime boundaries. 
Cannon (1986) concluded his discussion of cut-off points in source words 
by stating that they mostly occur between syllables, or between syllabic 
constituents with the fracto-lexemes being fused at a syllabic juncture, 
mostly involving resyllabification. These types of fusion at the fusing 
point (without or with overlap) are also discussed in section 5.3.1.2.ii since 
they relate to the feature of the cut-off point.  
Another study that provided evidence supporting the tendency for cut-
off points to occur at phonological joints or boundaries is that of 
Kubozono (1990) that compared morphological and phonological 
constraints on the structure of Japanese and English blends. Kubozono 
(1990, 4) found evidence that Japanese blends show the same tendencies 
as English blends. The focus in this overview concerns only Kubozonoâs 
(1990) findings on English blends.  
Kubozono (1990, 1-2) analysed a large corpus of 3661 English blends 
consisting of 61 spontaneous error-blends and 3600 consciously formed 
blends compiled from various sources, with the analysis focusing on 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
49 
morphological and phonological constraints. His main aim was to 
âuncover the phonological constraints on blending in Englishâ (Kubozono 
1990, 1). He examined the âpossible switch point at which two source 
words are each split and consequently combinedâ as being a consequence 
of phonological constraints on blending in English (Kubozono 1990, 5). 
These constraints are phonotactic and phonemic. The former constraint 
concerns ruling out forms with a phonemic shape that is identical to either 
of the source words and the latter concerns the phonological length of 
blends. The focus of this overview is only on the âswitch pointâ 
(Kubozono 1990, 5). 
From his corpus of error-blends and conscious blends, Kubozono 
(1990) identifies three major cut-off points in source words. Following a 
syllable structure of âonset-peak-codaâ, the phonological constraint 
prohibited cut-off points within a syllable constituent, where the cut 
resulted in a split of syllable constituents; namely, a split within an onset 
or a coda (Kubozono 1990, 6). This constraint implies that âthe blended 
items must switch in the same syllable position such that if one word is 
split in a given syllable positionâbetween the onset and the peak, for 
exampleâthe other word is split in the same positionâ (Kubozono 1990, 
6). This indicates that the cut-off point occurs either between the onset and 
nucleus or between the nucleus and coda of one syllable. This tendency 
applies to blends formed from monosyllabic source words. Added to these 
two cut-off points was a third possible cut-off point with blends formed 
from polysyllabic source words, where the cut-off point occurred at 
syllable boundaries (Kubozono 1990, 7).  
Moreover, Kubozono (1990, 14) found that, with polysyllabic source 
words, when the cut-off point occurred in one syllable of the first source 
word, the second source word has the cut-off point usually occurring in the 
corresponding syllable. For instance, the onset from the first source word 
was to be resyllabified with the rime (nucleus and coda) of the 
corresponding syllable from the second source word so that to maintain 
the length rule, which states that the number of syllables of a blend should 
be identical to that of one of the source words, in most cases the second 
(Kubozono 1990, 12). 
To summarise this overview, Kubozonoâs (1990) findings also support 
the tendency for English blends to have their source words cut at syllable 
boundaries or between syllabic constituents and then mostly between the 
onset and nucleus, in which case the rime (nucleus and coda) from the 
second source word is kept intact. 
In another study of cut-off points in source words, Kelly (1998) stated 
that âbreakpointsâ in blends do not fall randomly but rather cluster at 

3. Blending in English 
50 
major phonological joints. Kelly (1998, 584) used the term âbreakpointsâ 
to describe split points in blends and cut-off points in source words. From 
an examination of split points, it was found that they âfall primarily at 
major phonological joints, such as syllable, onset, and rime boundariesâ 
(Kelly 1998, 585-587). Split points in different blends vary based on 
where the cut-off point occurs in the source words. For instance, in the 
blend smog, the cut-off point occurs after the onset of smoke and before 
the rime of fog, whereas in the blend boost it occurs after the nucleus of 
boom and before the coda of hoist. Nevertheless, Kelly (1998, 585-587) 
states that âcertain breakpoints might be [favored] because they 
correspond with more natural phonological boundariesâ, especially those 
between the onset and rime (consisting of nucleus and coda).  
Kelly (1998) examined this tendency in his corpus of 165 intentional 
English blends, although, unfortunately, he did not give examples to show 
these cut-off points. He found that, firstly, the majority of cut-off points 
occur at word or syllable boundaries. However, when the cut-off point 
occurs within a syllable, the blends favoured preserving the rimes (nucleus 
and coda) over bodies (onset and nucleus), where an onset from the first 
source word is aligned with a rime from the second source word rather 
than aligning a body (onset and nucleus) from the first source word and a 
coda from the second source word. Moreover, the integrity of consonant 
clusters was maintained, with the cut-off point generally occurring after 
(or before) the consonant cluster rather than within it. Such cases of blends 
reflect one cut-off point in either or both source words, which leads to the 
sequential joining of the contributed fracto-lexemes without having shared 
parts.  
A study by Bertinetto (2001) also examined cut-off points in source 
words. In comparing the structure of blends in English, German, French 
and Italian, Bertinetto (2001, 63) proposed an analysis of blends based on 
phonemic shape, though in his examples of blends he described the 
graphemic and not the phonemic shape. The focus in this overview is only 
on the analysis of English blends in terms of cut-off points in source 
words. Bertinettoâs (2001, 63) corpus consisted of 250 English blends 
which he collected from Bryant (1974), Algeo (1977), and Lehrer (1996). 
Bertinetto (2001, 68-9) found three cut-off preferences: the first was 
for the cut-off point to occur at a syllable boundary, the second between 
the onset and rime (nucleus and coda) and the third between the body 
(onset and nucleus) and coda. Equally interesting in Bertinettoâs results 
were the types of recombination found where the fracto-lexemes combined 
to form the blend.  
The process of recombination may either preserve or change the 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
51 
structure of the blend. In the former, the two syllabic components coincide 
with the components in the source words, whereas in the latter the 
juxtaposition of components changes the syllabic structure of the blend 
relative to the structure of one or both of the source words (Bertinetto 
2001, 66). An example of the first case is the blend al.pha.me.tic < 
al.pha.|bet and a.rith.|me.tic, where the structure of the syllables in the 
blend preserves their original structure in the source words, while in the 
blend chat.ire < chat and sat.|ire the syllabic structure of the blend differs 
from the structure of the syllables in the first source word, though, of 
course, the first source word has only one syllable (Bertinetto 2001, 67). 
While considering these three cut-off preferences, Bertinetto (2001, 
67) identified four recombination patterns based on the nature of the split 
points in the blends, where the fracto-lexeme from the first source word 
joins with the fracto-lexeme from the second source word to form the 
blend. The first pattern involves cases of blends with no overlap, where the 
combination occurs at the only split point available in the source word, 
such as in chortle < ch|uckle and sn|ortle.13 The other three patterns 
involve cases of blends with overlapping where the combination may 
occur either before, after, or both before and after the overlap.14 This is the 
case with the blends blunge < bl|end and pl|unge (after the overlap), 
plodge < plo|d and tru|dge (before the overlap), and californicate < 
Californi|a and forni|cate (before and after the overlap).  
To sum up Bertinettoâs (2001) analysis of cut-off points in source 
words of English blends, it can be stated that it is generally the case that 
the cut-off point occurs between syllabic constituents or at syllabic 
boundaries. In most cases, this maintains the syllabic structure of the 
blend, with or without overlapping elements of fracto-lexemes. 
The findings of the research on blending in English outlined above suggest 
that there is a tendency for the cut-off points in source words to occur at 
syllabic joints, preferably between the onset and nucleus, or at a syllable 
boundary or word boundaries, with few cases between the nucleus and 
coda.  
Identifying where the cut-off points are in the source words makes it 
easy to see which parts of the source words are contributed to the blend. 
Plag (2003, 123) suggests that it is generally the first part of the first 
source word and the last part of the second source word that are joined to 
form the blend, following the pattern AB+CD=AD for the analysis of 
blends. Other patterns of joining the parts of source words form a 
minority, at 4-6%, of all blends as stated by Kubozono (1990, 4).  
Beliaeva (2014a, 34-5) proposed five structural types of blends based 
on âthe parts of the source words that enter into blendsâ, which she termed 

3. Blending in English 
52
âfracto-lexemesâ. Her data consisted of 487 neologisms, the majority of 
which were blends with two constituents. The data were compiled from 
several online sources of neologisms and occasionalisms. They were Word 
Spy, The Urban Dictionary, The Rice University Neologisms Database 
created by Suzanne Kemmer, Language Monitor, The McMillan 
Dictionary, The Word of the Year collections from Merriam Webster, and 
newspapers and magazines (Beliaeva 2014a, 31). 
Beliaeva (2014a, 34) found that the structural pattern of AB+CD=AD 
proposed by Plag (2003, 123) does not cover all the types of blends in her 
data. According to the different parts of the source words that were 
preserved in the blends, Beliaeva (2014a, 35) categorised the structural 
types of blends in her data, from the most frequent to the least frequent, as 
follows: 
 
i. 
AD (332 blends, 68.2%) where the beginning of SW1 is joined 
with the end of SW2, as in chofa < chair and sofa, and including 
cases in which SW1 is fully present in the blend, and clickmas < 
click and Christmas;  
ii. 
AW (83 blends, 17.0%) where the beginning of SW1 is joined 
with the entirety of SW2, as in fabulash < fabulous and lash; 
iii. 
WW (29 blends, 6.0%) where SW1 is joined with SW2 with an 
overlap, as in flabdomen < flab and abdomen; stoption < stop and 
option; 
iv. 
AC (23 blends, 4.7%) where the beginning of SW1 joins with the 
beginning of SW2, as in hydrail < hydrogen and railway, and 
including cases in which SW1 is fully present, and Obamacon < 
Obama and conservative; and 
v. 
Central replacement (20 blends, 4.1%) where SW2 is inserted in 
the middle of SW1, as in parahawking < paragliding and hawk. 
 
The results in this list show that it is generally the case that the initial 
fracto-lexeme from the first source word joins with the final fracto-lexeme 
from the second source word, which matches the general tendency 
identified in the literature regarding this feature.  
There is a relationship between the cut-off points in the source words 
and the contributed amount from the source words to the blend. When the 
cut-off point has been determined, it should then be easy to measure the 
amount retained from each source word in the blend. The following 
section gives an overview of several studies that have focused on 
measuring the contributions from source words to blends.

3.5.2. Proportional Contributions from Source Words to Blends 
When it comes to how much material is retained from the source words in 
a blend, two factors appear to interact: the semantics of the source words 
and their length. Kaunisto ((2000); (2013)) hypothesised that when 
forming a blend there is a tendency to minimise the loss of meaning by 
favouring the shorter source word in the resulting blend. Accordingly, the 
greater proportion would come from the shorter source word. In his 
research, Kaunisto (2013, 2) uses the term âproportional representation of 
source words in blendsâ. In this book, the term âproportional contributions 
from source words to blendsâ is the one that is used and examined.  
This hypothesis about the proportional contribution of the shorter 
source word was supported by the findings of Kaunisto (2000); (2013) 
after measuring the proportions taken from the source words of 102 
English blends. The data were compiled from the following sources: 
Algeo (1977), Cannon (1987), Å tekauer (1991), Kelly (1998), and the CD-
ROM editions of The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition (1992), 
Collins Electronic English Dictionary and Thesaurus, 3rd edition (1995), 
The Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary, 2nd edition (1996),  
and Merriam-Websterâs Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus, 10th edition 
(1999).  
Kaunistoâs (2013) detailed testing of his hypothesis is based on his 
previous brief outline on measuring the proportions of source words in 
blends (Kaunisto 2000).  Kaunisto  (2013) measured the graphemic 
contribution from the source words to the blends but he also referred to the 
fact that it is worth investigating the phonemic contribution, especially 
when the length of the source words and the form of language (written or 
spoken) in which blends were formed are taken into consideration. The 
length of the source words could be measured in terms of the number of 
graphemes or phonemes, depending on whether the blend originated in 
written language or spoken language (Kaunisto 2013, 4). Although 
Kaunisto (2013) mentions this point about written-spoken formation as a 
factor that potentially could be considered, it is not realistic to expect to be 
able to pinpoint the first occurrence of a blend, so in practice, this written-
spoken origin is always ignored also by Kaunisto himself who counted 
graphemic contribution, probably because that was easiest. 
Kaunisto (2013, 4) proposes an âaxiomâ stating that the proportion 
retained from the shorter source word is greater than the proportion 
retained from the longer source word. More precisely, for two words, X 
and Y, to form a blend, Z, where X is represented in Z by A and Y is 
represented in Z by B (so that the blend contains fracto-lexeme A from 
source word X and fracto-lexeme B from source word Y), Kaunisto (2013, 

3. Blending in English 
54 
4) presents his hypothesis based on this axiom as follows: 
 
âif x > y, then a:x Âb:y, where  
x = the number of letters/phonemes in X 
y = the number of letters/phonemes in Y 
a = the number of letters/phonemes in A 
b = the number of letters/phonemes in Bâ. 
 
To illustrate, Kaunisto uses the blends brunch and tangemon as 
examples. For brunch the calculation in terms of letters will be âX = 
breakfast, Y = lunch; A = br, B = unch; x (breakfast) = 9, y (lunch) = 5, a 
= 2, b = 4â, where 22% of breakfast and 80% of lunch are present in 
brunch, meaning that the proportion coming from lunch, the shorter source 
word, is greater than the proportion coming from breakfast, the longer 
source word. When applying the formula to tangemon, it also holds up, 
with 56% coming from tangerine, the longer source word, and 80% 
coming from lemon, the shorter source word (Kaunisto 2013, 4). In the 
case of such blends, the points where the source words were cut did not 
involve shared elements.  
Kaunisto (2013, 4) also pointed out that there are cases of blends that 
have shared elements, which are mostly joined in a âdiscontinuous 
fashionâ or non-sequentially. Such cases of blends were first referred to by 
BergstrÃ¶m (1906, 23) as having source words âcrossing each otherâ. These 
are cases where some elements in the blend are found in both source 
words, and these are therefore said to be jointly contributed from both 
source words (Kaunisto 2013, 4). The majority of these blends typically 
have overlapping elements, as mentioned above (Cannon 1986, 742). 
Examples of these blends are stagflation < stagnation and inflation, which 
has the final part (-ation) found in both source words; fantabulous < 
fantastic and fabulous, which has the first part (fa-) found in both source 
words; and chortle < chuckle and snort, which has the last part (-ort) from 
SW2 inserted within SW1 replacing the middle part of that word (-uck-).  
This description of the structure of such blends may be more attractive 
than claiming, for instance, that stagnation in the blend stagflation is 
represented only and exclusively by the fracto-lexeme stag-. However, 
cases of non-sequential fusion represent a small minority among existing 
blend words (BergstrÃ¶m 1906, 46); (Cannon 1987, 154).  
Regarding the question of whether to consider the number of letters or 
phonemes when measuring the proportional contributions from source 
words to blends, Kaunisto (2013, 6) states that âthe results of the words 
examined would not look drastically different if the analysis had focused 
on the numbers of phonemes instead of lettersâ. The calculation would 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
55 
have changed in only a few cases, especially with those that âillustrate the 
deliberately playful character of the words themselvesâ. Kaunisto (2013, 
6) gives the blend blaxploitation < black(s) and exploitation as an example 
of the case of blends where both words are phonemically preserved in their 
entirety, but this is not reflecting such cases, because the first vowel of 
exploitation is not represented in the blend. An example that better 
describes such cases is the blend sexploitation < sex and exploitation, 
where both source words are graphemically as well as phonemically 
represented in full in the blend. Nevertheless, Kaunisto (2013, 6) noted 
that, for this case, âa strict orthographical analysis would indicate that the 
shorter form is represented by fewer elements in the blendâ, meaning that 
his axiom did not hold for this blend. 
Finally, Kaunisto (2013, 6) also found that the ordering of the source 
words, in terms of which comes first and which second, did not play an 
important role in determining the greater proportional representation of the 
source words in the blend. There was no great difference as to whether it 
was the first source word or the second that had the greater proportional 
representation. Out of 102 blends, 33 had the first source word with 
greater proportional representation and 50 had the second (Kaunisto 2013, 
6). 
Following Kaunistoâs (2000) hypothesis as related to the proportions 
contributed from source words to blends, Gries (2004b) analysed the 
orthographic and phonemic structure of blends in English. In his research, 
Gries (2004b) investigated two features of blends in English: âthe amount 
of information contributed by the source words to the blendâ and âthe 
similarity of the source words to the blendâ. It is the former feature that 
concerns this book here. Gries (2004b, 639) found that âthe amount 
contributed by the source words is determined by the degree of 
recognisability of the source wordsâ, which he later validated by 
comparing intentional blends with speech-error blends. 
Kaunistoâs (2000) method of measuring the contribution from source 
words to blends is also used in Gries (2004b). In his analysis, Gries 
(2004b) wanted to overcome some drawbacks that he identified in 
Kaunistoâs (2000) analysis. Gries (2004b) examined cases of blends that 
include overlapping elements and not only cases with clear split points. He 
(2004b, 650) also examined cases of blends of source words that 
contribute different parts of themselves and not only cases where the first 
source word contributes its beginning and the second source word 
contributes its end. 
Gries (2004b) thus revised Kaunistoâs (2000) analysis to include cases 
of overlap. Gries (2004b, 651-2) added two methods of analysis for cases 

3. Blending in English 
56 
of overlap. One deals with cases of overlap that takes place at one split 
point, and another deals with cases of overlap that takes place at multiple 
points, as in the blend fantabulous < fantastic and fabulous.  
Analysis 1 in Figure 3.1 illustrates a blend that is interpreted as having 
overlap taking place at one split point and Analysis 2 in Figure 3.2 shows 
a blend interpreted as having overlaps taking place at multiple split points. 
The blend fantabulous is used to represent these two cases since this blend 
can be analysed using either method.

                                  an overlap    a split point with overlap 
 
Analysis 1 in Figure 3.1 shows that when analysing the blend fantabulous 
as having one point of overlap, the greater proportion (87.5%) comes from 
the graphemically shorter source word fabulous. Analysis 2 in Figure 3.2 
shows that when analysing the blend fantabulous as having multiple points 
of overlap, again the greater proportion (100%, namely the full source 
word) comes from the graphemically shorter source word fabulous.  
These two figures show that, while using either method of analysis, 
Kaunistos blend-graphemic-length hypothesis is borne out. When 
comparing the proportions of contribution from the two source words, 
both methods show that the greater proportional contribution comes from 
the graphemically shorter source word.  
Nevertheless, Gries (2004b, 651) also cited cases where the two 
methods of analysis give different results, as shown for the blend chunnel 
in Analysis 1 in Figure 3.3 and Analysis 2 in Figure 3.4.

Analysis 1 in Figure 3.3 supports Kaunistoâs hypothesis for cases of 
blends with overlap, where the greater proportional contribution comes 
from the graphemically shorter source word; but, according to Analysis 2 
in Figure 3.4, the word chunnel contradicts the hypothesis since the greater 
proportional contribution comes from the graphemically longer source 
word, though, of course, in this case, they are phonemically the same 
length. 
Based on these two methods of analysis, as well as the possible 
drawbacks that they highlight in Kaunistoâs (2000) hypothesis, Gries 
(2004b) proposed his approach where he analysed blends in terms of the 
interaction between these two factors; namely, the length of source words 
and the proportion of their contribution to the blend. 
Gries (2004b) implemented this analysis on his data of 585 blends 
compiled from Adams (1973), Akmajian, Demers, Farmer, and Harnish 
(1995 [1984]), Algeo (1977), Bauer (1983), Bryant (1974), Cannon 
(1986), Irwin (1939), Kaunisto (2000), Kelly (1998), Kemmer (2003), 
Murray (1995), Pound (1914), Å tekauer (1991), the Oxford English 
Dictionary on CD-ROM (version 1.15) (search word: blend), the

Encyclopedia Britannica 2000 (CD-version; s. v. blend), the internet pages 
of the course Linguistics/English 215, Words in English: Structure, 
History and Use, taught by Suzanne Kemmer at Rice University 
(www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ling215), and a summary on the LinguistList 
(issue 11.1378) by Suzanne Kemmer. 
Gries (2004b, 653-4) found that there was a significant interaction 
between length and contribution and that the results strongly supported 
Kaunistoâs (2000) hypothesis. The results reflected two preferences, which 
also support the general tendency for the proportional contributions from 
source words to blends. The first preference shows that when the first 
source word is longer, then the greater proportional contribution comes 
from the second source word; and when the second source word is longer, 
then the greater proportional contribution comes from the first source 
word. In other words, the greater contribution tends to come from the 
shorter source word. The second preference shows that when both source 
words have the same length, they strongly tend to contribute equal 
proportions to the blend (Gries 2004b, 654).  
3.5.3. Stress Patterns of Blends 
It is generally the case in blending that the stressed syllable of the blend 
corresponds to that of one of the source words (BergstrÃ¶m 1906, 46); (Bat-
El and Cohen 2012, 193). Two factors appear to play a role in determining 
the stress patterns of the blends: the size and the position of the source 
words. It is usually the longer source word that âdictatesâ the primary 
stress of the blend (Cannon 1986, 746), and in most English blends, the 
longer source word is the second source word (Gries 2004a, 426). This 
indicates that the size and the position of the source words interact in 
assigning the stress patterns of the blends. 
Bat-El and Cohen (2012) presented a comprehensive analysis of the 
stress system of English blends, in which they investigated the role of 
these two factors in assigning stress within a constraint-based Optimality 
Theoretic approach. The following discussion outlines their approach, 
analysis and findings. 
Bat-El and Cohen (2012) considered two factors: the size of the source 
words, measured in terms of the number of syllables, and the position of 
the stress in the source words. They found that there was no straightforward 
relationship of priority between these two factors, yet Bat-El and Cohen 
(2012, 193) did demonstrate their interaction. They found that priority was 
given to the stress of the longer source word and/or the stress of the 
rightmost source word (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 193). This interaction was 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
59 
maintained when these factors were combined in a constraint-based 
Optimality Theoretic approach whereby the analysis of blends resulted in an 
intra-word variation (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 193). 
Their analysis was based on the two minimally distinctive grammars of 
blend stress in English, which are: 
 
- FAITHMETRICALSTRUCTURE (henceforth, FAITHMS) >> 
FAITHHEADSW2 >> FAITHHEADSW1, which relates to the size 
of the source words, and 
- 
FAITHHEADSW2 >> FAITHMS >> FAITHHEADSW1, which 
relates to the position of the source word in the word pair.15 
 
Their dataset was based on a very narrow definition of what constitutes 
a blend, where they excluded the following cases: 
 
a) Blends of more than two source words, e.g. compÃºshity < 
compÃºlsion + push + necÃ©ssity; 
b) Blends of the forms AW, WC or WW, e.g. skinÃ³e < ski and canÃ³e; 
c) Blends of the form AC e.g. sÃ­tcom < situÃ¡tion and cÃ³medy; 
d) Blends formed with degemination, e.g. hÃ³tray < hot and tray; 
e) Blends including combining forms, e.g. workohÃ³lic < work and 
(o)hÃ³lic; and 
f) Blends with a source word that is an initial, e.g. Ã©mail < electrÃ³nic 
and mail (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 193-4). 
 
Although no reference was made to the amount of data they included 
in their analysis, Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 194) mentioned the sources 
from which it was compiled, which were Adams (1973), Bryant (1974), 
Algeo (1977), Gries (2004a), and Buzzwack.com. 
Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 195) found that, generally, when only one 
syllable is retained in the blend which originally carries stress in one of the 
source words, stress resides on this syllable in the blend, as in dynÃ©tic < 
dynÃ¡mic and magnÃ©tic. Nevertheless, their data included cases of blends 
that do not follow this pattern, and they investigated such cases based on 
the following conditions: 
 
1) Both stressed syllables from the source words are retained, as in 
fertigÃ¡tion < fÃ©rtilizer and irrigÃ¡tion, which has its stress from the 
stressed syllable coming from the second source word; 
2) Neither stressed syllable from the source words is retained, as in 
sÃ­mulcast < simultÃ¡neous and brÃ³adcast which has the same stress 
pattern as that of the second source word; 

3. Blending in English 
60 
3) One of the source words is monosyllabic, for example, [/bÃ­skwik/ < 
/bÃ­skit/ and /kwik/] in which case the blend receives its stress from 
the retained stressed syllable of the polysyllabic source word. 
 
In English, âstress is determined by faithfulness constraintsâ but when 
faithfulness constraints are not at work, the position of stress in a word is 
determined by the default stress of the language (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 
195). English blends are no exception to this general rule. 
Based on the âposition-based viewâ, the stressed syllable in the blend 
corresponds to that of the second source word regardless of its size, as in 
the blends fertigÃ¡tion < fÃ©rtilizer and irrigÃ¡tion (SW1=SW2), anchorlÃ¡stic 
< Ã¡nchor and elÃ¡stic (SW1<SW2), and aggranÃ³ying < Ã¡ggravating and 
annÃ³ying (SW1>SW2) (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 195-6). Meanwhile, 
based on the âsize-based viewâ, the stressed syllable in the blend 
corresponds to that in the longer source word regardless of its position in 
the blend. In such cases, the blend and the longer source word have an 
equal size (in terms of numbers of syllables), as in investopÃ©dia < 
invÃ©sting and encyclopÃ©dia (SW1<SW2), and hÃ¡ndkerchoo < hÃ¡ndkerchief 
and kerchÃ³o (SW1>SW2) (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 196). 
The first view does not apply when both source words have the same 
size, while the second does not apply when the size of the blend is 
different from that of either one of the source words (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012, 196). Accordingly, Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 196) adopted a 
combined approach including both size and position factors to analyse 
such cases of blends. 
To examine blends in the light of this view, Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 
197) distinguished three types of blends, which are: 
 
1) Blends whose size (expressed by the number of syllables) is 
identical to that of both source words (BlÄ±=SW1Ä±=SW2Ä±);16 
2) Blends whose size is identical to that of one of the source words 
(BlÄ±=SW1Ä±/BlÄ±=SW2Ä±); and  
3) Blends whose size differs from that of both source words 
(BlÄ±Â6:Ä±, BlÄ±Â6:Ä±, and SW1Ä±Â6:Ä±). 
 
From their analysis, it is apparent that, in cases of blends of source 
words that have identical numbers of syllables, it is not the size but rather 
the position of the source word that plays a role in assigning stress in the 
blend; whereas, in the cases of blends with source words of different sizes, 
it is the size of the source words that is decisive in assigning the stress in 
the blend.  

Blending, from English to Arabic 
61 
In their analysis, Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 197) identified two relevant 
constraints: FAITHHEAD and FAITHMS, which require input-output 
identity to maintain the relationship between the properties of the blend 
and those of its source words. These constraints are outlined below. 
Since the stressed syllable is the head of the word, the FAITHHEAD 
constraint for a blend must have two members: FAITHHEADSW1 and 
FAITHHEADSW2 (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 198). In 9 out of 10 cases of 
blends that have a size identical to that of both source words, and 
according to the FAITHHEAD constraint, it is the position that wins. This 
finding is based on the constraint ranking of FATHHEADSW2 >> 
FAITHHEADSW1, which gives priority to the stressed syllable of the 
second source word. Examples are the blends motÃ©l < mÃ³tor and hotÃ©l, 
and rockÃ³on < rÃ³cket and ballÃ³on (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 198). Only 
one exception out of 10 blends had the same stressed syllable as that of the 
first source word, which is squÃ¡drol < squÃ¡dcar and patrÃ³l, (Bat-El and 
Cohen 2012, 199). 
In 28 out of 29 cases from their data of blends that have a size identical 
to that of one of the source words, and according to the FAITHMS 
constraint, it is the size that wins where reference is made to the stress 
pattern rather than to the stressed syllable. This faithfulness constraint 
enforces the preservation of the metrical structure of the source words in 
the blend where it should be identical to that of either source word (Bat-El 
and Cohen 2012, 199). Examples are the blends digitÃ©ria < dÃ­gital and 
cafetÃ©ria, where the size of the blend is identical to that of the source word 
cafeteria and hence has the same stress pattern; and ballÃºte < ballÃ³on and 
pÃ¡rachute, where the blend has the same stress pattern as the source word 
balloon, both being identical in terms of the numbers of syllables (Bat-El 
and Cohen 2012, 199). For such cases, the ranking of the constraints is 
FAITHMS, FAITHHEADSW2>>FAITHHEADSW1, where the first two 
do not compete (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 200). In such cases, the prosodic 
pattern of one source word is preserved, while the segments of the other 
source word are superimposed onto it.  
The only exception (1 out of 29 blends) from their data was the blend 
cÃ¡mcorder < cÃ¡mera and recÃ³rder which has the same stress pattern as 
that of the first source word but not the same number of syllables (Bat-El 
and Cohen 2012, 200). 
There are cases of blends in their data where size (FAITHMS) and 
position (FAITHHEADSW2) compete because size calls for the first 
source word, and position calls for the second source word; these are 
blends that have the same size as that of the first source word (Bat-El and 
Cohen 2012, 201).

62 
In some cases, size (FAITHMS) wins, as in the blend hÃºrricoon < 
hÃºrricane and ballÃ³on, where the stress pattern of the blend is identical to 
that of the source word that has the same number of syllables (namely, the 
first source word). In other cases, position (FAITHHEADSW2) wins, as in 
the blend galvannÃ©al < gÃ¡lvanize and annÃ©al, where the stressed syllable 
of the second source word is preserved in the blend (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012, 201-2). 
In 31 out of 35 cases of blends where the size of the blend differs from 
that of both source words, and according to the relevant Optimality 
Theoretic faithfulness constraints of FAITHHEAD and FAITHMS, it is 
the position that wins, which is the default factor for blend stress 
assignment (in this case, FAITHHEADSW2). Examples are the blends 
anchorlÃ¡stic < Ã¡nchor and elÃ¡stic, and anecdÃ³tage < Ã¡necdote and 
dÃ³tage, which both have the same stressed syllable as that of their second 
source word (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 203). 
Four exceptions out of 35 blends were kÃ­ddypliance < kÃ­ddy and 
applÃ­ance, lÃ³rrytel < lÃ³rry and hotÃ©l, hÃ³llywooer < hÃ³llywood and wÃ³oer, 
and lÃºbricushion < lÃºbricant and cÃºshion, where the stressed syllable in 
the blend is identical to that of the first source word (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012, 204). 
Cases of blends with one monosyllabic source word did not behave 
differently from those with two polysyllabic source words. Nevertheless, 
Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 204) distinguished two sets of blends with one 
monosyllabic source word: those whose size is identical to that of the 
polysyllabic source word, and those whose size is different from that of 
the polysyllabic source word and, based on the factor of position, they 
distinguished between blends whose monosyllabic source word is the first 
source word and those whose monosyllabic source word is the second 
source word (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 204). 
In 126 out of 127 cases of blends whose size is identical to that of the 
polysyllabic source word, if the stressed syllable of this source word is 
retained it will be stressed in the blend, as in magnÃ©sticks < magnÃ©tic and 
sticks, and singspirÃ¡tion < sing and inspirÃ¡tion (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 
204). However, if the stressed syllable of the polysyllabic source word is 
truncated, the stress will fall on the monosyllabic source word retained in 
the blend, as in the blend blÃ³gives < blog and Ã¡rchives, where the stressed 
syllable in archives is truncated which means that blog in the blend carries 
the stress (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 204-5). This also shows that, in these 
cases, the stress pattern of the blend is the same as that of the polysyllabic 
source word, which means that the FAITHMS constraint is at work here 
(Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 205). The only exception out of 127 blends from 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
63 
the data is flÃ¡retrol < flare and contrÃ³l, where the stress in the blend is on 
the first source word, even though the stressed syllable from the source 
word of identical size is not truncated (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 205). 
In cases of blends whose size differs from that of the polysyllabic 
source word, it is the position of the monosyllabic source word that 
determines the stress of the blend (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 205). When the 
stressed syllable of the polysyllabic source word is retained and the 
monosyllabic source word is the first source word, the stress of the blend 
falls on that syllable, as in densÃ½lon < dense and nÃ½lon, and momprenÃ©ur 
< mom and entreprenÃ©ur; but when the stressed syllable of the 
polysyllabic source word is truncated and the monosyllabic source word is 
the first source word, stress falls on the syllable of the monosyllabic 
source word, as in fÃ¡nzine < fan and mÃ¡gazine (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 
206). In these cases, neither the FAITHHEAD nor FAITHMS constraints 
are at work due to the mismatch in the number of syllables in the blend 
and its source words (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 206). 
When both source words are polysyllabic, the generalisation arrived at 
when the blendâs size differs from that of both source words is that the 
stress of the blend corresponds to that of the second source word (with the 
position factor being active). Bat-El and Cohen (2012, 207) found that this 
generalisation holds when one of the source words is monosyllabic and it 
is the first source word, as in the blend densylon mentioned above, rather 
than the second, as in the blend cÃ­trisun < cÃ­tric and sun, where the stress 
of the blend corresponds to that of the first source word (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012, 207). 
In such cases, the FAITHMS constraint is violated and the 
FAITHHEADSW2 constraint is not satisfied since the second source word 
is monosyllabic (namely, with no lexical stress, and hence no head). This 
means that the FAITHHEADSW1 constraint operates, which is the lower-
ranked FAITHHEAD constraint. 
Faithfulness constraints are not at work in the stress assignment in the 
blend in two cases: when the stressed syllables of both source words are 
truncated, as in the blend elÃ©ctret < electrÃ­city and mÃ¡gnet, and when one 
of the source words is monosyllabic and the stressed syllable of the 
polysyllabic source word is truncated, as in the blend cÃ³ntrail < 
condensÃ¡tion and trail. In these cases, the default stress of English is 
assigned to the blend, which is on the heavy penultimate syllable (Bat-El 
and Cohen 2012, 208). 
Table 3.1 below summarises the results arrived at by Bat-El and Cohen 
(2012, 209) for stress patterns of blends of source words that are 
polysyllabic; again, the annotation is adjusted to match the conventions

constraints, 
which 
are 
FAITHMS, 
FAITHHEADSW2 >>FAITHHEADSW1, where the non-ranking of the 
first two accounts for the variation in stress assignment in blends. 
Nevertheless, blends with monosyllabic source words may diverge 
from these generalisations. Regardless of the position of the monosyllabic 
source word, if the stressed syllable of the polysyllabic source word is 
retained, it serves as the stressed syllable of the blend; otherwise, the blend 
is assigned the default stress of the language (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 
209). 
When it comes to the stress patterns, the data compiled for this book are 
examined in the light of these tendencies that Bat-El and Cohen (2012) 
have identified. Comparing their dataset to the one examined for this book, 
it appears that criterion (a) above, matches the basic criterion for data 
limitation adopted in this book, which is to include blends formed by 
joining only two source words. Cases of blends in the dataset of this book 
that are similar to criteria (b)-(d) above were not excluded from the dataâ
the data include cases of blends formed by all fusion possibilities. As for 
cases of blends in (e) and (f) above, they do not apply to the dataset since 
the source words included neither combining forms nor initials. 
3.6. Summary of Blend-Formation Tendencies in English 
The tendencies for blend formation that have been identified in the 
literature on blending in English and based on the three main features 
discussed in section 3.5 are summarised below. 
The tendencies associated with the cut-off point in the source words 
relate to their prosodic structure. It is generally the case that the cut-off 
point tends to occur at phonological boundaries, either between syllabic 
constituents or at syllabic boundaries. The preferences for cut-off points in 
the source words, arranged from the most to the least frequent, occur at the 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
65 
following points: 
 
a. between syllabic constituents, usually between the onset and 
nucleus, as in brunch  < br_eakfast and l|unch; or 
b. at a syllable boundary, as in alphametic < al.pha.|bet and 
a.rith.|me.tic; or 
c. at word boundaries, as in morphosyntax < morphology and syntax, 
where the second source word exists in its entirety in the blend; or  
d. between the nucleus and coda, as in plodge < plo|d and tru|dge, 
where both source words have the cut-off point between the 
nucleus and coda. 
 
The tendencies associated with the proportional contributions from 
source words to blends relate to the recognisability of the source words. It 
is generally the case that blends minimise the loss of meaning by 
favouring the shorter source word. Accordingly, the greater proportional 
contribution comes from the shorter source word. This strong preference 
for the proportional contribution indicates that when the first source word 
is longer, then the greater proportional contribution comes from the second 
source word, and when the second source word is longer, then the greater 
proportional contribution comes from the first source word. Another 
preference indicates that when both source words have the same length, 
there is a strong tendency that they will contribute equal proportions to the 
blend (Gries 2004b, 654).  
Concerning the tendencies associated with stress assignment in blends, 
it is generally the case that the stressed syllable of the blend corresponds to 
that of one of the source words (BergstrÃ¶m 1906, 46), (Bat-El and Cohen 
2012, 193). Two factors appear to play a role in determining the stress 
patterns of blends in English: the size and the position of the source words. 
It is usually the longer source word that âdictatesâ the primary stress of the 
blend (Cannon 1986, 746), and in most English blends, the longer source 
word is the second source word (Gries 2004a, 426). This indicates that the 
size and the position of the source words interact in assigning the stress 
patterns of the blends. 

4. BLENDING IN ARABIC 
 
 
 
4.1. Introduction 
This chapter discusses the classification of blends in Arabic based on a 
review of the available literature on word formation in Arabic (section 4.2) 
and the tendencies for forming blends in Classical Arabic focusing on 
what the traditional Arab grammarians had referred to concerning this 
linguistic phenomenon (section 4.3). A summary of the literature on 
blending in Arabic is provided in section 4.4.  
4.2. Classification of Arabic Blends 
Previous research on Arabic blends has mainly focused on two aspects of 
blend formation. The first is the nature of the source words from which 
blends are formed (Al-Maghribi 1908, 21-23). Specific issues falling 
under this heading are whether the source words are coordinates, iÚ²ÆIDK 
âgenitiveâ constructs, or sentences, and the question of which of the root 
graphemes are preserved in the blend and what their order is in the source 
words (Al-0ÇVÆ-7). The second aspect of blends, which has been 
investigated, is their parts of speech ((Al-Maghribi 1908, 21-23); (Abi 
à¦£ÆWLP).  
Arabic blends are classified, in traditional literature, into two 
categories based on the type of the source words from which they are 
formed. The first category includes blends that are formed from two 
source words, which are either two coordinate verbs or a genitive 
construction. Blends that are formed from two verbs usually have the part 
of speech of an adjective, as is the case for instance with the blends 
GÞ«LEDWÞ«U/ âthe strong manâ < /GÞ«DEDWÞ«/ âregulateâ and GÞ«DEDU/ âfastenâ, 
and VÞ«DKVÞ«DOLT meaning in Arabic âan old woman with a vociferous 
voiceâ < /VÞ«DKDO/ âwhinnyâ and VÞ«DODT/ âintense soundâ (Al-Khaà§¬Æ¯E
439-440). Blends that are formed from a genitive construction are said to 
be usually used as nicknames, as is the case with the blend /Ý§ab.Ýam(ij)/ < 
/Ý§abd/ and /Ýams/âa nickname âthe slave of the sunâ, and /Ý§ab.dar/  < 
/Ý§abd/ and /da:r/âa nickname âthe slave of the houseâ (Al-Khaà§¬Æ¯E
440). 
 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
67 
Although Al-Khaà§¬Æ¯E (2003, 440), being one of the traditional 
grammarians, describes this type of blends as having been formed by 
joining two letters from the first word with two letters from the second 
word, he does not seem to add any new aspects of the analysis of Arabic 
blends that have not already been mentioned in the literature.  
The second category includes blends whose source words come from a 
sentence or an expression (Al-Khaà§¬Æ¯E. These blends are usually 
formed by joining letters from two or more words from a sentence or an 
expression to convey the overall meaning of these structures. In such 
cases, some words in the sentence are not represented in the blend but are 
pragmatically understood since they refer to someone or something 
contextually recognised. An example of this type is the blend /Æ«aj.Ý§al(a)/ 
âcame toâ, which is formed from only two words which are /Æ«aj.ja/ 
âcomeâ and /Ý§a.la:/ âtoâ, conveying the meaning of the sentence /Ý¦an.ta 
Æ«DM.ja Ý§a.la: Ý¦VÞ«VÞ«DODW [DMU DO-Ý¦a.mal/ âYou come to do prayers/good 
deedâ. Although many words from the sentence are not represented in the 
blend, they are still contextually recognised by users where they would 
normally /Æ«aj.Ý§al/ âcome toâ prayers. Another example is the blend 
Æ«DZODTD meaning someone is saying /la: Æ«Dwla wa la: qu.wa.ta Ý¦il.la: 
bil.la:h/ âThere is neitKHUFKDQJHQRUSRZHUEXWIURP$OOÆKâ, where only 
Æ«DZOD and /qu.wa.ta/ are represented in the blend and the other words are 
contextually understood. 
Of these two main categories, there is no favoured category in terms of 
which of them reflects the most prototypical type of blend. The semantics 
of the blend is parallel to that of the source words joined together. The first 
category includes coordinative blends that are usually formed from two 
words of the same part of speech and in this case reflect a paradigmatic 
relationship. The second category includes genitive constructions or 
sentences which reflect syntagmatic relationships. Nevertheless, the 
literature on blending does not address or refer to the role of the semantics 
of Arabic blends. What scholars focus on is that blend formation is a 
matter of prosodic patterns: are they following the traditional root-and-
pattern structure, or rather a novel one or a borrowed one? 
There is another classification of Arabic blends found in the literature. 
This classification is based on the part of speech of the resulting blend. It 
classifies blends as verbal, adjectival, nominal or what is called 
genealogical (in modern terms, a proper name based on a family/ tribe/ 
clan). An example of verbal blends is the blend /Æ«aj.Ý§al(a)/ meaning 
someone is saying âcome over to do prayersâ <  Æ«DMMDâcomeâ and /Ý§a.la:/ 
âtoâ , of adjectival blends is the blend /GÞ«i.baWÞ«r/ âthe strong manâ < 
/GÞ«DEDWÞ«/ âregulateâ (Adj.) and GÞ«DEDU/ âfastenedâ (Adj.), of nominal

blends is the blend /nu.mruq/ âa small pillowâ < /na.maq/ âembellishâ and 
/raqq/ âsoftenâ, or of genealogical/ lineal relationship denoting a family 
name or reference is the blend /Ý§ab.dar(ij)/  < /Ý§abd/ and /da:r/, a nickname 
with the meaning âthe slave of the houseâ (Al-Maghribi 1908, 21-23); 
%DOÆVL-3); (Abi à¦£ÆWLP.  
4.3. Tendencies in Classical Arabic Blend-Formation 
No specific tendency in blend formation is clearly identified in any of the 
studies mentioned above, except for one statement made by Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL 
(1988) in which he describes how the few established blends found in 
Classical Standard Arabic are formed. 
As Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL (1988) describes classical Arabic blends as having 
tended to be formed by joining the first two root consonants from two 
different lexemes and mapping them onto one of the established prosodic 
patterns which are mostly four-consonantal templates, in which case if 
there is a root ABC and a root DEF, blending takes AB and DE, and then 
puts them into a template, adding the vowels. For instance, the blend 
/Ý§ab.Ýam/ is formed by taking the root graphemes   /Ý§b/ and /Ým/ from the 
roots /Ý§bd/ and /Ýms/ of the source words /Ý§abd/ and /Ýams/ and put into the 
template CaCCaC, where the root graphemes replace the Cs in the 
template in an orderly manner. The slots for the consonants in this 
template, which appear as in _a_ _a_ will be filled by the root graphemes 
coming from the source words, hence the resulting blend will be Ý§abÝam. 
This means of forming blends in Arabic was identified based on cases of 
classical blends formed centuries ago.  
The traditional process of blending in Arabic was restricted to this 
means for bringing new words to the lexicon, whereas the contemporary 
process includes various methods. A number of these methods resemble 
those used when forming neologisms in other languages, especially in 
English, as will become clear in the following chapters. 
Two main features relate to the structure of Arabic blends. The first 
feature relates to the number and position of the graphemes contributed 
from the source words to the blend. However, it is noted that in cases of 
roots whose second grapheme is a vowel-grapheme, it is generally the case 
that this grapheme is skipped so that the following consonant-grapheme is 
contributed (Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL  .17 The second feature relates to the 
prosodic pattern that the resulting blend exhibits, which is mostly 
CaCCaC,18 whether a nominal or verbal pattern ((Al-6KLKÆEL; 
(Al-0ÇVÆ-7); (Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL.

69 
Henceforth, the former feature is referred to as the feature of root 
contribution (RC in tables) and the latter as the feature of word pattern 
(WP in tables).  
To spell out this tendency, the blends given in section 1.1.2 above are 
analysed in Table 4.1 below displaying how these two features are 
maintained. The blends and their source words in this table are given in 
their stem forms.

Regarding the number and position of the graphemes contributed to the 
blend from the source words, it is clear that for the blends /Ý§ab.Ýam/ Ï¢Ë´Î¸Ë¸ÎË´Ï 
and /dÝ¤aÝ§.fad/ ÎªË´ÏË¸ÏË´Î, the first two consecutive root consonants are 
contributed from both source words to the blends. As to the feature related 
to word pattern, it is clearly shown that both blends conform to the word 
pattern CaCCaC.  
A superficial look at the blend /Ý§ab.Ýam/ might suggest that it seems to 
have been formed by joining what could be conceived as the fracto-
lexemes /Ý§ab-/ and /Ýam-/. Due to the similarity between the form of the 
blend /Ý§ab.Ýam/ and the combination of the constituting so-called fracto-
lexemes, this derivational process might look as if it were a concatenative 
morphological process. But derivation in Arabic, as has been mentioned 
earlier, is non-concatenative. The similarity between the form of the blend 
/Ý§ab.Ýam/ (together with other blends) and that of the combination of its 
so-called fracto-lexemes /Ý§ab-/ and /Ýam-/ is a matter of coincidence, not 
of regularity in morphological derivation. This observation is supported by 
the analysis of the blend /dÝ¤aÝ§.fad/ meaning someone is saying âPD\$OOÆK
make me redemption for youâ, /dÝ¤a.Ý§al(a)/ âmadeâ and /fi.da:Ý¦/ âredemptionâ. 
If it was assumed that the blend /dÝ¤aÝ§.fad/ was formed by 
concatenatively joining the so-called fracto-lexemes /dÝ¤aÝ§/- and /fid-/ from 
the source words /dÝ¤a.Ý§al/ and /fi.da:Ý¦/ respectively, then the resulting 
blend would have been */dÝ¤aÝ§.fid/, and not /dÝ¤aÝ§.fad/. The correct analysis 
is compatible with what has been pointed out in the traditional literature on 
Arabic blends: /dÝ¤aÝ§.fad/ is an example of the root-and-pattern method 

4. Blending in Arabic 
70 
with the word pattern CaCCaC. 
The analysis of the blends /Ý§ab.dar/ and /dam.Ý§az/, and according to the 
feature of root contribution, shows that the first source word of the blend 
/Ý§ab.dar/ and the second source word of the blend /dam.Ý§az/ each 
contributes the first two consecutive root consonants to the blend; whereas 
the second source word of the blend /Ý§ab.dar/ and the first source word of 
the blend /dam.Ý§az/ each contributes the first and third root letters, which 
are consonants, skipping the second root letter, which is a vowel; that is, 
each contributes their first two root consonants to the blend. As to the 
feature word pattern, both blends assume the word pattern CaCCaC. 
According to traditional grammarians, these four blends adhere to this 
tendency, supporting the claim that specific âroot lettersâ contribute to 
forming the blend by inserting them into the consonant slots of the word 
pattern CaCCaC (,EQ )ÆULV  ; (Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL  ). 
However, there are only a few blends in Classical Arabic, so the process 
seems to have had low productivity when being compared to the same 
process in English. 
Nevertheless, it is found in the literature that there are newly formed 
blends at the present day, the majority of which are not formed according 
to this means ((Al-.DZÆNLEL; (Al-à¦£uà§¢ari 1966)). These are mostly 
blends used in the fields of science and technology. .LIÆà¦¤ (2018, 157-8) 
gives several blends which he labels as contemporary Arabic blends. 
Examples are /Ýan.ka.bu:t(ijjah)/ network < /Ýa.ba.kah/ ânetâ and 
/Ý§an.ka.bu:t(ijjah)/  âspiderâ, /Æ«DMQDEDW/ âan animal-plantâ < /Æ«DMDZDQ/ 
âanimalâ and /na.ba:t/ âplantâ, and /rak.madÝ¤(a)/ âsurfedâ < /ra.kab(a)/ 
ârodeâ and /mawdÝ¤/ âwavesâ. The blend /rak.madÝ¤/ is formed according to 
the identified root-and-pattern method for forming blends in Classical 
Arabic; whereas the other two blends are not. They are instead formed by 
truncating either or both source words and concatenatively joining the 
remaining parts.  
However, there has been a debate amongst Arab linguists as to whether 
or not to consider this tendency as one means of forming blends in Arabic. 
Although the details of this debate are outside the scope of this book, it is 
still worth mentioning that Ibn FÆUis ((1979); (1997); (2001)) and Al-
Kirmaly (1938) are amongst the most prominent linguists who claim that 
blends should be formed following the identified features of Arabic 
blends; whereas contemporary scientists claim that forming blends in 
Arabic should not be restricted to the classical means of forming blends, 
especially with scientific terms used in modern research to cope with the 
terms used in modern Western research (Adriana 2014, 31).

4.4. Summary of Blend-Formation Literature in Arabic 
Overall, it can be said that there has been very little research so far on 
blending in Arabic, perhaps because in Classical Arabic, there are only a 
few words that could be examples of this word-formation pattern. Existing 
work on these classical blends tends to describe them as involving the 
selection of certain graphemes from the source words and combining these 
into a new word, which has new vowel graphemes inserted into it.  
A more precise characterisation of the process is given by Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL 
(1988), who points out that it is the first two consonants of each of the 
source words that form the input to the blend and that the result after 
vowel insertion is always CaCCaC. In modern terms, it could, therefore, 
be said that the literature identifies two tendencies (in fact, rules) in 
classical Arabic blending. Concerning root formation, the first two 
consonants from each source word go into the blend, which is therefore 
quadriliteral. Concerning the prosodic template, the word pattern adopted 
is always CaCCaC. It is interesting to see that the classical blends are 
formed according to the root-and-pattern derivational process of Arabic, 
which makes them very different from English blends. However, the 
number of such blends is small, suggesting comparatively low productivity 
of the process. 
 

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
 
 
5.1. Introduction 
The Arabic blends collected were examined based on the three major 
features and their related tendencies that have been identified in the 
literature on English blend formation, as discussed in Chapter 3.  
These features are: 
1) The location of the cut-off points in the source words, with English 
having a preference for the cut-off point to occur at a word or at a syllable 
boundary, or between (but not within) syllabic constituents, and also with 
a preference for it to occur between the onset and nucleus. An examination 
of this feature can be used to determine two things: which syllabic 
constituents are mostly preferred as contributions to the blend and the 
location in the source word of the contributed fracto-lexeme whether 
initial, medial or final. 
2) The proportion of graphemic and/ or phonemic contribution from the 
source words to the blend, where there is an interaction between the length 
of the source words and the amount of their contribution to the blends, 
with English having a preference for the greater proportion of contribution 
to come from the shorter source word. 
3) Stress patterns in the blends, based on which source word is privileged 
in determining the stress pattern of the resulting blend, with English 
having a preference for the blend to have the same stress pattern as that of 
the second source word and/ or the word that has the same size as the 
blend. 
The discussion in this chapter unfolds as follows: Section 5.2 consists 
of three subsections: Section 5.2.1 is an analysis of established Arabic 
blends in the light of the features identified for blend formation in Arabic, 
section 5.2.2 discusses the features of Arabic blends, and section 5.2.3 
analyses established Arabic blends in the light of English blend-formation 
features and tendencies. Section 5.2.3 examines the tendencies for the 
three features reviewed in detail in Chapter 3, which are: (1) the location 
of the cut-off points in source words (section 5.2.3.1), (2) the proportional 
contributions from source words to blends (section 5.2.3.2), and (3) the 
stress patterns of blends (section 5.2.3.3). Section 5.2.4 summarises the 
tendencies identified for forming established Arabic blends.

Section 5.3 is dedicated to the analysis of the collected novel invented 
blends, focussing again on the three features just mentioned (sections 
5.3.1, 5.3.2, and 5.3.3). For each feature, the analysis of the blends from 
the survey and the experiment are presented separately, followed by a 
comparison of the results. Finally, section 5.4 discusses some further 
observations made while analysing the novel invented blends like 
homophonous responses (section 5.4.1), reversed blends (section 5.4.2), 
blends with new sort vowels (section 5.4.3), and sandwich blends (section 
5.4.4). 
5.2. Analysis, Discussion, and Features of Established 
Arabic Blends 
As will be shown in section 5.2.1, the established blends in Classical 
Arabic appear to adhere to the blending tendencies identified in the 
traditional grammatical literature on Arabic. That is, they are formed 
according to the root-and-pattern derivational process of Arabic. The 
established blends in Modern Arabic are different: they are characterised 
by the sequential joining of fracto-lexemes, making them more similar to 
English blends than to classical blends.  
5.2.1. Analysis and Discussion of Established Blends 
The 99 established blends compiled consist of 61 classical blends and 38 
modern blends. These blends were frequently mentioned in the literature 
on blending in Arabic, especially the resources that have been consulted 
for this work. These blends and their source words with their transcription 
and meanings are given in Appendices B and C.  
In this section, the established blends of Arabic are examined in terms 
of the two methods for forming blends in Arabic: that of root-and-pattern, 
and that of concatenation. Regarding the root-and-pattern method, two 
features are involved: that of the root contribution and that of the prosodic 
pattern. The blends are examined following these two features separately. 
The reason for following this way for examining the blends is because the 
collected classical Arabic blends show partial conformity to this method. 
That is, some blends completely conform to the feature of root 
contribution but not to that of the word pattern, and vice versa. 
 The analysis of the classical Arabic blends shows that most of the 
blends exhibit the word pattern CaCCaC, whether they conform 
completely or only partially to the feature of root contribution. Table 5.1 
below presents the results of an analysis of all the established classical

blends collected in terms of the root-and-pattern method identified in the 
literature. The blends are arranged according to the frequency of the 
patterns of root contribution from the most to the least frequent. All source 
words of Arabic origin in this table are of three root graphemes (i.e. with 
triliteral roots). It is worth mentioning here that the sounds /w/ and /j/ within 
the Arabic root are considered root vowel-graphemes, not semi-vowel 
sounds. The root of each source word is represented by numbers in a column 
that specifies the position of the root graphemes in the source words in a way 
where 123 represents the root of SW1 and 456 represents the root of SW2 
(see Appendix B for meanings of Classical blends and their source words).

The table shows that these blends either completely or partially conform to 
the feature of root contribution and that of word pattern of the tendencies 
identified for forming Arabic blends. Regarding the feature of root 
contribution, this table shows that only 14/61 (23%) of the blends conform 
to the feature of root contribution, where each source word contributes its 
first two root consonants to the blend, as in /bar.qal/, /Ý§ab.dar/ and 
Æ«LVÝ§.kaf/. On the other hand, there are blends for which either one of their 
source words conforms to the feature of root contribution, as in 26/61 
(43%) blends where SW1, but not SW2, contributes its first two root 
consonants to the blend, as in /baÝ§ÈDU/, /dÝ§ab.xan/, and /sÝ§ah.sÝ§a.liq/, and 
4/61 (7%) blends where only SW2 contributes its first two root consonants 
to the blend, as in Æ«DMKDO/, /ras.Ý§an/ and /sam.Ý§al/. Additionally, in 18/61 
(30%) blends, neither source word conforms to the feature of root 
contribution, as in Æ«DVEDO/, /qaÝ.Ý§am/ and /ÝasÝ§.lab/.  
The table also shows that the most frequent consonant pattern for 
classical blends is 12 56, which indicates that the blend is formed from the 
first two root consonant-graphemes from SW1 and the last two root 
consonant-graphemes from SW2, with 21/61 blends (34%). This pattern 
does not seem to reflect the tendency identified in the traditional literature 
on blend formation in Arabic, which states that blends are formed from the 
first two root-consonant graphemes of both source words. 
The analysis also shows other tendencies for forming blends in terms

of the root-and-pattern method. There are 11/61 (18%) blends where the 
SW1 contributes all of its root graphemes with the SW2 either

As for the feature of word pattern, the analysis shows that the most 
frequent pattern is CaCCaC, which is the identified pattern in the 
literature, with 46/61 (75%) blends exhibiting it. The analysis also shows 
that the pattern CuCCuC is also frequent, with 8/61 (13%) blends 
exhibiting it. 7KHUHDUHDOVRRWKHUSDWWHUQVDVLQÆ«LGELÞUCiCCi:C, and

The results of this analysis show that it is not unusual to find a classical 
Arabic blend with source words contributing root graphemes other than 
the first two consonant-graphemes or exhibiting a word pattern other than 
CaCCaC. Nevertheless, it can be said that there are two (moderately) 
strong tendencies in the classical data: (1) SW1 tends to contribute its first 
two consonants (39 blends, 63% of all examples), and (2) the blend has the 
word pattern CaCCaC (46 blends, 74% of all examples). It is also 
noteworthy that all of the classical blends are formed following the root-
and-pattern method where the source words are joined non-concatenatively to 
form the blend.  
The established blends of Modern Arabic are different. Table 5.2 
below presents the results of an analysis of these blends in terms of the 
root-and-pattern method (see Appendix C for meanings of Modern blends 
and their source words), also arranged from the most to the least frequent 
pattern of root contribution. Words of non-Arab origin mostly have more 
than three root graphemes, like SW2 /hid.ru.dÝ¤LÞQRIWKHEOHQGQD]GÝ¤an/, 
which has five root graphemes, represented as 45678.

5. Results and Discussion 
80 
The results in this table show that only 17/38 (45%) of the established 
modern blends are formed following the root-and-pattern method for 
forming Classical Arabic blends. In only 4/17 (24%) of these blends, both 
source words contribute the first two root consonants and the blend 
exhibits the pattern CaCCaC. Examples are /sar.nam/ and /rak.madÝ¤/. Of 
the feature of root contribution in the remaining 13/17 (76%) blends, 8/13 
(62%) have only SW1 contributing the first two root consonants, as in 
/dar.Ý§am/ and /EDWÞ«GÝ¤al/, and only one blend, /daw.fam/, has SW2 
contributing the first two root consonants. In the remaining 4/13 (31%) 
blends, neither source word adheres to the tendency identified for the 
feature of root contribution, as in /dÝ¤aw.qal/ and /liÝ§.nif/. Regarding the 
feature of word pattern, 9/13 (69%) blends exhibit the word pattern 
CaCCaC. 
 Concerning this set of modern blends, it can, therefore, be said that 17 
(45%) of all examples resemble the classical blends in showing the 
following two tendencies: (1) SW1 contributes its first two consonants 
(14/17 blends, 82%), and (2) the blend has the word pattern CaCCaC 
(13/17 blends, 76%). 
The remaining 21/38 (55%) modern blends appear to reflect a process 
of joining fracto-lexemes which is not mentioned in the literature. Firstly, 
the analysis shows that they do not adhere to the tendency for the feature 
of root contribution identified, although they exhibit some attested Arabic 
word patterns. Secondly, the blends can be parsed at some point in such a 
way as to reflect a concatenative structure, which is not an identified 
feature of the formation of blends in Classical Arabic. The structure of 
these blends is displayed in Table 5.3 below, showing which fracto-
lexemes of the SWs are joined.

Of these blends, 14/21 (67%) blends are formed by joining the initial 
fracto-lexeme of SW1 with the whole of SW2, as in TDEÆ«DUE and 
/Ý§asÝ§.dÝ¤DQDÆ« known as âpartial blendsâ where only one source word is 
reduced and the other is present in the blend in its full form (Mattiello 
2013, 120). These blends are very frequent in English and confirm the 
relevance of the second source word to the whole blend. The remaining 
blends (7/21, 33%) reflect variations in the locations of the contributed 
fracto-lexemes: three have the initial fracto-lexeme of SW1 joined with the 
final fracto-lexeme of SW2, which is a prototypical English pattern, as in 
Æ«DMÈXP and one blend, /TLWÞ«VDU is formed by joining the initial fracto-

82 
lexemes of both SWs. The blends /Ýib.za:l/ and /faq.ba.naf.sa.dÝ¤ij/ have 
one of their SWs contributing non-sequential fracto-lexemes. Meanwhile, 
/dÝ¤aÃ°.ridÝ¤l/ is formed by the full contribution of both SWs with an overlap 
at one point, which covers the internal ends of the source words. The blend 
/Ýan.ka.bu:t/ reflects an interesting feature of onset replacement where the 
onset of the first syllable in the SW1 replaces that of the corresponding 
syllable in the SW2. This feature has not been identified before in Arabic. 
The different combinations of the fracto-lexemes can be conveniently 
displayed in terms of the structural pattern of AB+CD proposed by Plag 
(2003) for the analysis of blends in English (see section 1.1.1). In cases of 
blends where either one of the source words is present in its entirety in the 
blend without having an overlap with the other source word, the part of the 
structural pattern representing it is referred to by the letter W, indicating a 
full word. 
Table 5.4 below shows the numbers of blends for each structural 
pattern with the parts with a strikethrough indicating non-sequential 
contribution and the underlined parts the overlapping segments. For 
instance, the structural pattern of the blend /Ýib.za:l/ < /Ýibh/ and /za.la:l/ is 
AB+CD=ACD, with a strike-through CD indicating that there is non-
sequential contribution from SW2; and the structural pattern of the blend 
/dÝ¤aÃ°.ridÝ¤l/ < /dÝ¤aÃ°r/ and /ridÝ¤l/ is AB+CD=ABCD, with an underlined 
BC indicating overlap at this point.

The table shows that the most frequent pattern is the one that includes the 
first part of the first source word and the whole of the second source word. 
One last point should be mentioned about both sets of blends in 
Classical and Modern Arabic, which is the position of the source words in 
the blends. In these two sets of blends, except for the two blends 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
83 
/dÝ¤aw.qal/ and /haw.mal/, the order that the source words would normally 
have if they occurred together in a sentence is not maintained in the blend. 
The blend /dÝ¤aw.qal/ âairborneâ is formed from the source words /dÝ¤aw/ 
âatmosphereâ and /na.qal/ âtransportâ, which within an ordinary sentence 
would have the order /na.qal/ âtransportâ and /dÝ¤aw/ âairâ, as in X 
/na.qal(a)/ Y /dÝ¤aw(wan)/ (S.V.O.Adv.), and the blend /haw.mal/ 
âairborneâ is formed from the source words /ha.wa:Ý¦/ âairâ and Æ«DPDO/ 
âcarriedâ, which also in an ordinary sentence would have the order 
Æ«DPDO/ âcarriedâ and /ha.wa:Ý¦/ âairâ, as in X Æ«DPDOD Y 
/bil.ha.wa:.Ý¦(i)/ (S.V.O.PP.). This indicates that it is not unusual to find 
blends formed by joining the source words in a reversed order, more 
specifically, an English order 
The analysis so far has shown that classical blends are all formed 
following the root-and-pattern method and that around half of the 
established modern blends also work like this. In both sets, there is a 
tendency for SW1 to contribute its first two consonants and for the 
template of the blend to be CaCCaC. The fact that these are mere 
tendencies, not firm rules, indicates that such âtraditionalâ blends show 
considerable latitude in the choice of the root-and-pattern method adopted. 
This makes them rather different from the core cases of root-and-pattern 
template morphology in Arabic, where the patterns are completely fixed. 
The other half of the modern blends is not formed following the root-and-
pattern method at all; instead, they are formed following the concatenation 
method. The following section examines the features of both types of 
Arabic blends. 
Accordingly, a blend in Arabic can be defined as a new lexeme formed 
by joining two or more other lexemes following a root-and-pattern method 
or a concatenation method and exhibiting an identified word pattern in 
Arabic, meaning that two methods are identified for forming blends in 
Arabic. 
5.2.2. Features of Arabic Blends 
After examining the data compiled for Classical and Modern Arabic, it is 
found that blends tend to be formed according to two major tendencies: 
classical and modern. The classical type adheres to the tendencies 
identified for forming Classical blends (as discussed and found out in 
section 5.2.1) and the modern type adheres to both these tendencies as well 
as to a blend-formation tendency similar to the one identified in the 
literature for blend formation in English (as discussed in section 3.5). 
 

5. Results and Discussion 
84 
Although it appears that there are two very different processes at work: 
classical-type blends work according to the root-and-pattern method and 
modern-type blends work according to the concatenation method, it can be 
useful to group the three features identified for forming Arabic blends to 
work on categorising blends according to these two types. 
It is possible at this point to draw up a table for methods of forming 
Arabic blends based on the analysis of both datasets. This table includes, 
in addition to the identified root-and-pattern method, the method of 
concatenative joining (CON method in tables). This comprehensive table 
could then be used to check the level of conformity of any Arabic blends 
to these methods.  
The feature of root contribution is checked for each source word 
separately, not for both of them together. Examining this feature is not 
restricted only to the contribution of the first two root consonants from the 
source words but rather expands to include cases of blends whose source 
words contribute root graphemes from different parts in the word, not only 
the first two parts. Examining the feature of word pattern is not restricted 
to the one that traditional grammarians specified, which is CaCCaC, but 
rather expands to include cases of blends that show a high preference for 
exhibiting other Arabic word patterns. Table 5.5 below displays the level 
of conformity to the features on a scale of one to four for a sample set of 
blends from the data given in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2. See Appendix E for 
a full table. Blends are arranged from the most to the least conforming.  
Annotations used in this table refer to the following: 
 
- Y = 1; meaning that the blend completely conforms to the tendency 
identified for the specified feature or method. 
- P = 0.5; meaning that the blend partially conforms to the tendency 
identified for the feature of root contribution, where the source 
word contributes any of its root graphemes regardless of their 
amount and ordering within the root of each source word; or the 
blend partially conforms to the tendency identified for the feature 
of word pattern, where the blend exhibits a pattern other than 
CaCCaC that forms a preference for some blends to exhibit;  
- N = 0; meaning that the blend does not conform to the tendency 
identified for the specified feature or method, where the source 
words, for instance, do not contribute root graphemes or the blends 
exhibit nonce patterns, or a pattern not attested in Arabic; or the 
source words do not contribute fracto-lexemes, but rather root 
graphemes.

The results, as fully presented in Appendix E, show that any novel blends 
can be tested according to the features identified in the literature on Arabic 
blends. Although there are blends that only conform to one feature, they 
are still called blends. The definition of a blend in Arabic can be broader 
than the one identified with blends in Classical Arabic to include newly 
formed blends. These new blends do not necessarily conform to all of the 
features.  
5.2.3. Analysis and Discussion of Established Arabic Blends  
in the Light of the Features of English Blends 
This section examines in detail the 21 established blends that are formed 
through a process of concatenating fracto-lexemes coming from the source 
words, similar to the general blending pattern found in English and other 
languages. They will be analysed in light of the three features of English 
blends discussed in Chapter 3. To identify the most frequent patterns in 
these blends, their mean average frequencies are calculated. Any patterns 
that are located above the mean average frequency represent the most 
frequent ones and the labels and frequency figures for those patterns are 
shown in bold in the tables that follow. 
The following section (5.2.3.1) discusses the tendencies based on the 
location of the cut-off point in source words. The discussion of tendencies 
for the proportional contributions from source words to blends is given in 
section 5.2.3.2. The discussion of the tendencies for stress patterns in 
blends is given in section 5.2.3.3. Section 5.2.4 presents a summary of the 
tendencies identified for forming the collected established Arabic blends.

5.2.3.1. Tendencies for Cut-off Points in Source Words 
 
This section examines the feature of the location of cut-off points in the 
source words for the established blends. Four major tendencies relating to 
the feature of cut-off points that have been identified in English (see 
section 3.5.1) are considered in this discussion. The tendencies identified 
based on the feature of cut-off point in the source words relate to their 
prosodic structure. It is generally the case that the cut-off point tends to 
occur at phonological boundaries either between syllabic constituents or at 
syllabic boundaries. The preferences for cut-off points in the source words, 
arranged from the most to the least frequent, occur in the following points: 
between syllabic constituents, usually between the onset and nucleus; or  
 
- at a syllable boundary; or 
- at word boundaries; or  
- between the nucleus and coda.

means that 20 blends are examined for this feature. below presents an 
analysis of this set of established Arabic blends. Table 5.6 below shows 
the location of the cut-off point in the two SWs (at word boundaries, at a 
syllable boundary, between syllabic constituents, inside syllabic 
constituents), one example blend is given for each pattern, the SWs of the 
example, and the frequency of the pattern.

The results in this table show that the most frequent preference for the 
combination of cut-off points in source words is: inside the coda + at word 
boundaries, with 9/20 (45%) of the blends showing this preference. The 
second preference for the combination of cut-off points is: between the 
onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word + at word 
boundaries, with 3/20 (15%) of the blends showing this preference.  
Regarding the first preference, this combination contains a cut-off 
point that is inside a syllabic constituent; this location for the cut-off point 
is rare in English. 
There is some variation in the types of fusion found at the split points 
in these blends. Specifically, there are three types of fusion, the most

We can also consider the preferences for the location of the cut-off 
point in each source word; that is, the preference for the cut-off point in 
the first source word and that in the second source word, separately.

The table shows two most frequent preferences for the location of the cut-
off point in the first source word. These preferences are: (1) inside the 
coda, with 10 (50%) of the blends showing this preference, and (2) 
between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word, with 
5 (25%) of the blends showing this preference. The most frequent 
preference for the location of the cut-off point in the second source word is 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
89 
at word boundaries, with 15 (75%), meaning that the whole source word is 
present in the blend in its entirety. 
Table 5.9 below displays the frequency figures for the location of the 
cut-off points in all of the source words of these blends taken together.

As can be seen, there are three most frequent locations for the cut-off 
points in the source words of the established Arabic blends, which are: 
 
- at word boundaries;  
- inside the coda; and 
- between onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word. 
 
It should be noted, though, that these preferences are not equally strong 
in SW1 and SW2, as the data in Table 5.8 clearly show. 
 
5.2.3.2. Tendencies for Proportional Contributions from Source 
Words 
 
This section examines the feature of proportional contributions from 
source words to established blends. Two major tendencies relating to the 
feature of proportional contribution from source words to blends that have 
been identified in English (see section 3.5.2) are considered in this 
discussion. Both tendencies relate to the length of the source words, 
measured by the number of units, in this discussion, phonemes. The two 
tendencies are: firstly, it is generally the case for English blends that the 
greater proportion of contribution comes from the shorter source word 
(Kaunisto 2000, 49-50). Second, when source words have equal length, it 

5. Results and Discussion 
90 
is generally the case that there is an equal proportion of contribution from 
both source words to the blend (Gries 2004b, 654).  
The 99 established blends are analysed following the method of 
analysis implemented by Kaunisto (2000, 49) and developed by Gries 
(2004b, 651), discussed in section 3.5.2.  
This set of blends consists of two subsets: 78 of the blends are root-
and-pattern ones, and 21 are concatenative. The root-and-pattern blends 
will be analysed in terms of the root contribution, i.e. in terms of how 
many consonants in the blend come from SW1 and how many from SW2. 
Since these blends have an independent vocalic pattern/ template, analysis 
of source word contribution for their vowels is not possible. The 
concatenative blends will be analysed in terms of both vowels and 
consonants coming from SW1 as opposed to SW2.  
Of the 78 root-and-pattern blends, 72 are blends with source words of 
equal root lengths, e.g. /baÝ§ÈDUEDÝ§DÈDnd /Ý¦DÈDUERWKVRXUFHZRUGV
are of triliteral roots, and 6 blends with source words of different root 
lengths, e.g. /liÝ§.nif/ < /laj.jin/ (triliteral root) and /zuÝ§.nuf/ (quatriliteral 
root). Of the 21 concatenative blends, 15 blends have source words of 
different phonemic lengths and 6 have source words of equal phonemic 
lengths. 
The results of applying the method referred to above suggest that if X 
and Y = Z (where X and Y are the source words, and Z is the blend), and if 
X > Y, then a:x < b:y, where a is the contributed part from X and b the 
contributed part from Y. This finding for English also works the other way 
round; that is if X < Y, then a:x > b:y, where a is the contributed part from 
X and b the contributed part from Y. In other words, the greater proportion 
of contribution tends to come from the shorter source word regardless of 
its position in the blend.  
To explain how the established blends are analysed, two are analysed 
below as samples of established root-and-pattern blends and established 
concatenative blends. 
Figure 5.1 below displays how the proportional root-contributions for 
the root-and-pattern blend /rak.madÝ¤/ âsurfâ are calculated.

This figure shows that both source words, having the same root length,

This figure shows that the greater proportional phonemic contribution 
comes from the second source word, which has a longer phonemic length. 
In calculating the proportional contributions, each blend is coded 
according to the phonemic length of its source words as well as their 
proportional contribution to the blend. This coding replicates the one used 
by Gries (2004a, 418).  
Table 5.10 below displays the results for the proportional contributions 
from the source words to the 78 established root-and-pattern blends. The 
left-hand column indicates the length of the source words and the top line 
indicates whether both source words contribute equal proportions to the 
blend, or the first source word contributes the greater proportion to the 
blend, or the second source word contributes the greater proportion to the 
blend.

5. Results and Discussion 
92 
The results show that 3 (4%) of the blends have SW1 shorter than SW2, 3 
(4%) of the blends have SW2 shorter than SW1, and 72/78 (92%) have 
both source words of equal root length. This distribution looks much 
skewed; however, it conforms to the tendency of blending source words 
that are similar in terms of length. Nevertheless, it has to be realised that 
most words in Arabic are triliteral. All the SWs in the SW1=SW2 category 
are also of this kind, so these figures in Table 5.10 simply reflect the 
general pattern of word length in Arabic. 
When it comes to source word contribution, the results show a high 
preference for equal root proportional contributions, with 52/72 (72%) of 
the blends of SW1=SW2, as in /bal.Ý§am/ âesophagusâ < /ba.laÝ§/ âgulpâ 
and WÞ«DÝ§m/ âtasteâ showing this preference. When both the left-hand 
column and the top line in Table 5.10 are considered, the results also show 
that when both source words have the same root length, they tend to 
contribute equal root proportions to the blend.

source word, especially when it is longer phonemically. 
 
5.2.3.3. Tendencies for Stress Patterns of Blends 
 
This section discusses the stress patterns of established Arabic blends in 
light of the tendencies identified for blends in English. It is generally the 
case that the stressed syllable of the blend in English corresponds to that of 
one of the source words (BergstrÃ¶m 1906, 46); (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
93 
193); it is usually the longer source word that âdictatesâ the primary stress 
of the blend (Cannon 1986, 746), and in most English blends, the longer 
source word is the second source word (Gries 2004a, 426). This indicates 
that the size and the position of the source words interact in assigning the 
stress patterns of the blends. 
 In Arabic, the prosodic pattern of the word determines its stress pattern. 
For instance, the prosodic pattern of the blend /ÆÝ§ab.Ýam/ is ÆCVC.CVC and 
it is this pattern that means that stress in this word falls on the penultimate 
syllable.  
Stress assignment in Arabic is relatively simple. There are three 
patterns, described by Al-Jarrah (2002, 91-2) as follows: Stress falls on the 
final syllable of the word if and only if it is super heavy, i.e. with a coda 
consisting of two or more consonants (/CVCC/) as in NDÆWDEW/ âwroteâ or 
with both a branching nucleus and a coda (/CVVC/), as in NDÆEi:r/ 
âbigâ.If the final syllable is not super heavy, stress goes to the penultimate 
syllable if it is heavy, i.e. /CVC/ or /CVV/, as in ÆPDNWDE/ âofficeâ and 
ÆNDWLE/ âwriterâ.In all other cases, stress falls on either the penultimate, 
as in PDNÆWDEDK/ âlibraryâ, or on the antepenultimate syllable, as in 
ÆVDPLÝ§a/ âheardâ, whichever is separated from a preceding heavy 
syllable (or a word boundary) by an even number of light syllables. 
Since word stress in Arabic is determined by the prosodic pattern it 
exhibits, it is rarely found in this set of data that the blend gets its stressed 
syllable from either of the source words. The two main factors regarding 
this feature are:  
 
- Whether the blend has a syllabic size different from/ similar to that 
of both or either source word; and 
- whether the blend exhibits a stress pattern different from/ similar to 
that of either source word. 
 
The established Arabic blends displayed in Table 5.5 are examined in 
the light of this feature, except for the blend /sÝ§al.Ý§am/ < /sÝ§al.la:/, /Ý§a.la:/ 
and /sal.lam/, which is formed from three source words.  
Of the 99 established blends, 56 (57%) have source words of identical 
syllabic sizes and 43 (43%) have source words of different syllabic size. 
Table 5.12 below displays the stress patterns of Arabic blends while 
referring to the syllabic size of the source words as having identical or 
different sizes.

The results show several preferences for the stress patterns of established 
Arabic blends. Two preferences can be observed within the dataset with 
source words that have identical syllabic sizes and two preferences 
concern source words that have different syllabic sizes.  
When both source words have identical syllabic sizes, there is a 
preference for the blends that have a syllabic size different from either 
source word to have also a stress pattern that is different from that of either 
source word, and a preference for the blends that have a syllabic size that 
is identical to that of both source words to have a stress pattern that is also 
identical to that of both source words. An example blend illustrating the first 
preference is /Ý¦a.Ænar.kaz/ âegocentricâ < /ÆÝ¦a.na:/ âegoâ and /Æmar.kaz/

âcentreâ. In total, 31/31 (100%) of the relevant blends are like this. An 
example blend illustrating the second preference is /Ækar.bal/ âlaxity in 
legsâ < /Æka.bal/ âshackleâ and /Æra.bal/ âfleshyâ. In total, 12/25 (48%) of 
the relevant blends are like this. When the source words have different 
syllabic sizes, there is firstly a clear preference for the blends that have a 
syllabic size that is identical to that of either source word to have also a 
stress pattern that is identical to that of this source word. Example blends 
illustrating this preference are /ÆdÝ¤al.Ý§ad/ âsternâ < /ÆdÝ¤a.lad/ âfortitudeâ 
and /dÝ¤aÝ§d/ âfuzzyâ, and /ÆqaÝ.Ý§am/ âagedâ < /qaÝÝ§/ âdry skinâ and 
/Æqa.dim/ âbecome oldâ. In total, 27/35 (77%) of the relevant blends are 
like this, with 15/18 (83%) of the blends that have an identical syllabic 
size to that of SW1 to also have an identical stress pattern as that of this 
SW, and with 12/17 (71%) of the blends that have an identical syllabic 
size to that of SW2 to have an identical stress pattern as that of this SW. 
Secondly, the blends that have a syllabic size different from that of both 
source words tend to have also a stress pattern that is different from that of 
both source words. An example blend illustrating this preference is 
/Ýa.ÆTDÆ«WÞ«DE âsplitting woodâ < /Ýaqq/ âsplitâ and /ÆÆ«DWÞ«DE âwoodâ. In 
total, 8/8 (100%) of the relevant blends are like this. 
When considering the preferences based on the (non-)identity of stress 
position in blends and SWs shown in column 5 of Table 5.12 above and 
without referring to the syllabic size of both source words shown in 
column 1 of the same table, or the syllabic size of blends to SWs shown in 
column 3 of the same table, the results also support this tendency. 
Table 5.13 below displays the overall results regarding the stress 
patterns of established blends.

5.2.4. Summary of Tendencies for Forming Established  
Arabic Blends 
This section summarises the findings for the tendencies related to the three 
features of cut-off points in source words, proportional contributions from 
source words to blends, and stress patterns of blends in the compiled 
established Arabic blends.  
It is generally the case that source words of the established Arabic 
blends have the cut-off points at a phonological joint, specifically at word 
boundaries or between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of a source 
word. But there is also a substantial number of blends that have a source 
word with a cut-off point inside a coda. These tendencies are similar to the 
ones identified for the cut-off point in the source words of English blends. 
Cut-off points in source words tend to occur at phonological boundaries, 
either between syllabic constituents or at syllabic boundaries, except that 
in English, a cut-off point inside syllabic constituents is rarely found. 
Regarding the proportional contributions from source words to blends, 
the general tendency for source words of identical root length is to 
contribute equal root proportions to the blend, and for the greater phonemic 
proportional contribution to come from the second source word, with a high 
preference for the longer source word to be that contributor. Concerning the 
first part of the tendency, Arabic blends are similar to English blends in that 
when they have source words of identical sizes, they tend to contribute equal 
proportions to the blend; whereas, when they have different sizes, in 
English, it is generally the case that the greater proportional contribution 
comes from the shorter source word, but in Arabic, the greater proportional 
contribution comes from the longer source word.  
Regarding the stress patterns of blends, firstly, it is generally the case 
for blends whose syllabic sizes are different from that of either source 
word to also have a stress pattern that is different from their stress patterns, 
especially when the source words themselves have different syllabic sizes. 
But when the blend has a syllabic size identical to that of either source 
word, there is a tendency for the blend to have a stress pattern identical to 
that of this source word. 
These findings reflect some similarity between Arabic blends and 
English blends as to stress assignment. It is generally the case that the 
stressed syllable of the English blend corresponds to that of one of the 
source words (BergstrÃ¶m 1906, 46); (Bat-El and Cohen 2012, 193), which 
is usually the longer source word (Cannon 1986, 746), especially when it 
is the second source word (Gries 2004a, 426). The discussion turns now to 
the examination and analysis of the novel invented blends collected

5.3. Analysis and Discussion of Novel Invented Arabic 
Blends in the Light of English Blending Tendencies 
This section presents the analysis of the novel invented Arabic blends 
compiled through the survey and experiment. In this section too, the three 
major features and their related tendencies are examined in the analysis of 
these novel invented Arabic blends. 
Two minor factors to be considered will be the position of the source 
words in the word pair (as SW1 or SW2), and the size of the source words 
measured in terms of the number of syllables.  
As discussed in section 2.3.3, of the three kinds of responses given in 
the surveyâundiacritised, partially diacritised, and fully diacritised 
blendsâthe first two are not ideal for examination of cut-off points in the 
source words because the lack of diacritisation causes uncertainty about 
the shape of the intended forms and the possible location of cut-off points 
within them. Hence, in the analysis that follows, only the fully diacritised 
responses in the survey and the fully vowelised responses in the 
experiment are included. These represent a total of 59 responses from the 
survey and 503 responses from the experiment.  
The following section discusses the cut-off points in source words, 
starting with the results from the survey (section 5.3.1.1) followed by the 
results from the experiment (section 5.3.1.2). For each section, six aspects 
related to the cut-off point are examined: a) combinations of cut-off points, 
b) types of fusion at split points, c) location of fracto-lexemes in each 
source word separately, d) preferences for the location of the cut-off point 
in all of SW1s and all SW2s separately, e) locations of cut-off points in 
source words in general, and f) the relation between the position of the cut-
off point and the size of the source word. Section 5.3.1.3 concludes with a 
summary of the results and findings of the data from the survey and the 
experiment regarding cut-off points.  
The description of the proportional contributions from source words to 
blends is given in section 5.3.2. The discussion of the tendencies for 
proportional contributions in blends from the survey are given in section 
5.3.2.1, and those in blends from the experiment in section 5.3.2.2. Section 
5.3.2.3 concludes with a summary of the results and findings of the data 
from the survey and the experiment regarding this feature.  
The stress patterns of blends and how they are affected by the stress 
patterns of the source words are examined in section 5.3.3. The discussion 
of the tendencies for stress patterns of blends from the survey are given in 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
99 
section 5.3.3.1, and those in blends from the experiment are given in 
section 5.3.3.2. Section 5.3.3.3 concludes with a summary of the results 
and findings of the data from the survey and the experiment regarding 
stress patterns of blends.  
5.3.1. Cut-off Points in Source Words  
It should be noted that there are some responses in the dataset that, after 
being phonemically transcribed, show what appear to be multiple cut-off 
points in one or both of the source words. These cases are not considered in 
examining this feature. In data collection, the stimuli were graphemically 
presented to the informants, and this means that responses with source 
words having multiple cut-off points are simply formed based on a non-
sequential selection of some graphemes from the source words while 
ignoring the diacritics that represent short vowels. To form their blends, 
the informants joined these graphemes together while, when necessary and 
especially to facilitate pronunciation, adding new short vowels that are not 
found in either one of the source words.  
Examples from the survey of such blends having multiple cut-off 
points in either one or both of the source words include /ma.Ã°ab/ given as 
a response to the word pair P_DVâdiamondâ DQGÃ¨D_KD_Eâgoldâ, where 
the second source word has two cut-off points; and /xaMDWÞ«um/ given as a 
UHVSRQVH WR WKH ZRUG SDLU [_L_MD:_U âcucumberâ DQG WÞ«DP_DWÞ«_L_P
âtomatoâ, where each source word has three cut-off points with two new 
short vowels added to the contributed fracto-lexemes: /a/ is added to the 
fracto-lexemes from the first source word, and /u/ is added to the 
contributed fracto-lexeme from the second source word.  
Examples from the experiment of blends having multiple cut-off points 
in either one or both of the source words include /dÝ¤ul.ban/ given as a 
response to the word pair /dÝ¤X_EQâcheeseâ DQGO_D_EDQâyoghurtâ, where 
the second source word has two cut-off points; and /ma.da:Ý¦/ given as a 
UHVSRQVH WR WKH ZRUG SDLU P_DÝ¦/ âwaterâ DQG G_DZ_DÝ¦/ âmedicationâ, 
where the second source word has two cut-off points. 
Of the 59 fully diacritised responses from the survey, only 6 had 
multiple cut-off points in their source words, hence leaving 53 responses 
from the survey. Of the 503 fully vowelised responses in the experiment, 
87 had multiple cut-off points in their source words; hence leaving 416 
responses from the experiment.  
The discussion that follows concerning the Arabic data is presented in 
light of the tendencies (as outlined in section 3.5.1) for English blend 
formation based on the location of the cut-off point in the source words. In

H[SHULPHQWGDWDVHWVDUHJLYHQZLWKWKHYHUWLFDOEDU_LQGLFDWLQJDFXW-off 
point in the source words.  
The tendency identified based on the cut-off points in the source words 
of English blends indicates that there is a preference for the cut-off point 
to occur at a word or syllable boundary or a within-syllable break. When 
the cut-off point occurs at a within-syllable break, the preference is for it 
to occur mostly between the onset and nucleus of that syllable, in a way 
where an onset from the first source word is combined with a rime from 
the second (Kubozono 1990); (Kelly 1998, 585); (Gries 2004b, 648). 
The tendencies identified in English distinguish between two syllabic 
structures for blends: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. It has been 
determined that, in monosyllabic blends, it is mostly the case that one 
onset from the first source word adjoins to a rime from the second source 
word. Polysyllabic blends tend to have a syllable from the first source 
word adjoining to a syllable from the second source word, or an onset 
from one syllable in the first source word adjoining to the rime of the 
syllable corresponding in its position to that in the second source word.  
In examining the data, cases of overlap are considered while 
identifying cut-off points in the source words. Such responses are analysed 
based on the two modes of analyses: one without showing overlap, and 
another showing overlap. An example is the blend /dÝ¤ubz/ < /dÝ¤ubn/ 
âcheeseâ and /xubz/ âbreadâ that can be analysed once according to the 
first mode of analysis as having parts of the fracto-lexemes common to 
both source words, as in /dÝ¤ubz/ < /dÝ¤ub_QDQG[_ubz/, with the parts in 
bold italics being the overlapping segments, and another according to the 
second mode of analysis as having no shared elements from the source 
words, as in /dÝ¤ubz/ < /dÝ¤u|EQDQG[X_bz/. 
 These two modes are implemented based on the feedback from the 
informants (as discussed in section 2.2.5). The informants tend to cut what 
they call âgraphemic unitsâ from the source words. This technique mostly 
reflects a cut-off point between syllabic constituents, usually between the 
nucleus and coda, or a syllable or at word boundaries. 
On the other hand, when analysing the blends as having overlapping 
segments, the fusion extends over more than one point, hence causing the 
cut-off point to occur, in some cases, within syllabic constituents. For 
instance, in cases of blends like /dÝ¤ubz/ < /dÝ¤ub_Q DQG [_ubz/ with an 
overlapping segment of more than one element (/ub/), although the fusion 
starts at the sound /u/ of the first source word /dÝ¤ub_QWKHFXW-off point 
does not occur after this sound, but rather after the last point of fusion, 
which is the sound /b/. Hence, cut-off points can occur sometimes inside a 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
101 
syllabic constituent, especially when the fusion includes overlapping 
segments across the phonological joints as is the case with the blend 
/dÝ¤ubz/. Accordingly, both techniques for identifying cut-off points in 
source words are considered in the analysis of the responses in datasets. 
The discussion starts by examining the cut-off points in the source 
words of the 53 responses to the survey (106 source words) and the 416 
responses to the experiment (832 source words) separately, and then it 
considers the cut-off points in the whole dataset of 469 responses (938 
source words).  
To identify the most frequent patterns for cut-off points in the source 
words, the mean average frequencies of each pattern are calculated. Any 
patterns related to cut-off points in the source words that are located above 
the mean average frequency represent the most frequent ones. 
For each dataset, the results are analysed based on two factors: 
locations of the fracto-lexemes in the source words and the size of the 
source words. These factors help examine several related sub-features of 
the feature of cut-off points, which are: (1) the combinations of cut-off 
points in the source words, (2) the types of fusion at split points in the 
blends, (3) the patterns of fracto-lexemes, (4) preferences for the location 
of cut-off points in the source words while referring to their position in the 
blend, (5) preferences for the location of cut-off points in all of the source 
words of each dataset, and (6) preferences for the location of cut-off points 
in source words while referring to their size. The combinations of cut-off 
points and the position of the source words are displayed as represented in 
the novel blends.  
 
5.3.1.1. Tendencies for Cut-off Points in Responses from the Survey 
 
The responses to the survey include cases of overlap where the blend 
contains elements that are found in both source words. These represent 24 
blends out of the 53 that are subject to analysis of the feature of the cut-off 
point. The data are analysed based on the two modes of analyses, where 
the first mode of analysis does not show overlap and the second mode of 
analysis does. 
 
5.3.1.1.i. Combinations of cut-off points in the source words 
 
Table 5.14 below displays the results for the combinations of cut-off 
points in the source words of responses to the survey without showing 
overlap.

*A novel blend with a new diacritic which is indicated by the underlined vowel.  
 
The table shows that the most frequent combinations of cut-off points in 
source words of responses to the survey are: 
 
- inside the coda + between the onset and nucleus; 
- inside the coda + at a syllable boundary; 
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word 
+ between the onset and nucleus; 
- between the onset and nucleus + between the onset and nucleus of 
the 1st syllable of the source word;  
- between the nucleus and coda + at a syllable boundary; and 
- at a syllable boundary + at word boundaries. 
 
The results show that when the overlapping segments are shared by 
both source words, two of these combinations would then have the cut-off 
point in the first source word within a syllabic constituent, namely inside 
the coda.

Comparing the most frequent preferences for the data from the survey 
in Table 5.14 and Table 5.15, we see that the combinations in the first 
mode of analysis that include cut-off points at phonological joints either 
disappear in the second mode of analysis, as is the case, for instance, with 
the combination between the nucleus and coda + between the nucleus and 
coda or they become less frequent in the second mode of analysis, as is the 
case, for instance, with the combination between the nucleus and coda + 
syllable boundary of the first mode of analysis. Table 5.16 below shows a 
comparison of the most frequent patterns in both modes of analyses for the 
combinations of cut-off points in responses from the survey based on both 
modes of analyses. The combinations are listed in each column based on 
their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

This comparison also shows that, in both modes of analyses, four 
combinations come out as having high frequencies, which are: 
 
- between the nucleus and coda + at a syllable boundary; 
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word 
+ between the onset and nucleus; 
- between the onset and nucleus + between the onset and nucleus of 
the 1st syllable of the source word; and 
- at a syllable boundary + at word boundaries. 
 
5.3.1.1.ii. Types of fusion at the split points in blends 
 
The different combinations of cut-off points in the source words cause 
variation in the types of fusion found at split points in the blends. This 
variation will be examined here in responses from the survey based on the

two modes of analyses to find out if there is a change in the patterns of 
types of fusion at split points in the blends along with any changes in the 
locations of cut-off points in the source words.

The table shows that the most frequent patterns of the types of fusion at 
split points in the blends are resyllabification and onset replacement. 
A comparison of the patterns of the types of fusion based on the two 
modes of analyses is given in Table 5.19 below. The most frequent 
preference for the type of fusion based on both modes of analyses is 
resyllabification. The next most frequent preference for the type of fusion 
in blends of the survey based on the first mode of analysis is coda 
replacement; whereas based on the second mode of analysis it is onset 
replacement. The types of fusion are listed in each column based on their 
order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

5.3.1.1.iii. Patterns of fracto-lexemes 
 
After examining the combinations of cut-off points in source words of 
responses to the survey in section 5.3.1.1.i. based on the two different 
modes of analyses, it is found that the results for the patterns of fracto-
lexemes are the same based on both modes of analyses.  
The patterns of fracto-lexemes will again be analysed in terms of the 
AB+CD structure proposed by Plag (2003) for the patterns of analysis of 
blends in English, in addition to being displayed following the pattern 
adopted in this book, as displayed in Table 5.3. 
Table 5.20 below displays the frequencies of the patterns of fracto-
lexemes in responses from the survey.

The table also shows four patterns for the locations of the fracto-lexemes 
in the source words of the blends, with the combination initial + final (i.e. 
pattern AD) as the most frequent preference.  
When considering the locations of the fracto-lexemes in the source 
words, the results show that, for most of the responses, it is the fore part 
from the first source word and the hind part from the second source word 
that join to form the blend.  
 
5.3.1.1.iv. Locations of cut-off points in source words while referring to 
their position in the blend 
 
The combinations of cut-off points also reflect the preferences for the cut-
off point in each source word of the word pair; that is, the preference for 
the cut-off point in the first source word and that in the second source 
word. 5.3.1.1.i below displays the locations of cut-off points in the first 
and second source words separately in the responses to the survey based 
on the first mode of analysis.

The table shows that the most frequent locations of cut-off points in the 
first source word are between the nucleus and coda and at a syllable

somewhat more variability. The table shows that the most frequent 
locations are: 
 
- between the nucleus and coda;

The table shows that the most frequent locations of the cut-off point in the 
first source word are: 
 
- inside the coda;  
- at a syllable boundary;  
- between the nucleus and coda; and 
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source 
word.  
 
As to the cut-off point in the second source word, the table shows that 
the most frequent preferences are between the onset and nucleus and at a 
syllable boundary.

We can also consider the location of the cut-off points in all of SW1s and 
SW2s taken together, so disregarding the position of the source word in 
the blend.

The table shows that the most frequent locations of cut-off points in all of 
the source words are: 
 
- between the onset and nucleus;  
- at a syllable boundary;  
- inside the coda;  
- at word boundaries; and  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 1st syllable of the source 
word. 
 
Comparing the most frequent patterns for cut-off points in all of the 
source words in Table 5.23 and Table 5.24, it can be seen that there are 
locations of cut-off points that are common to both modes of analyses. 
Table 5.25 below displays a comparison of the most frequent locations of 
cut-off points in all of the source words of responses to the survey based 
on both modes of analyses and following their order of frequency in Table 
5.23 and Table 5.24. The locations of cut-off points are listed in each 
column based on their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

The table shows that, based on both modes of analyses, three locations are 
commonly found, which are: 
 
- between the onset and nucleus; 
- at a syllable boundary; and  
- at word boundaries. 
 
The table also shows that the level of frequency for the locations of 
cut-off points based on the first mode of analysis differs from that based 
on the second mode of analysis and that there are locations that are 
common to one mode of analysis and not to the other, like the cut-off point 
inside the coda.  
 
5.3.1.1.vi. Locations of cut-off points in source words while referring to 
their size 
 
The results also show that there is a relationship between the cut-off point 
and the size of the source words. Although there is a general tendency for 
cut-off points to occur mostly at phonological joints, there is some 
variation in cut-off points in the source words in terms of the number of 
their syllables. 
To examine the relationship between the cut-off point and the size of 
the source words and to determine if there is a difference in the results 
when considering cases with obvious single fusion points as opposed to 
cases of overlap, the results from both modes of analyses of responses to 
the survey are considered. The size of a source word is measured in terms 
of the number of its syllables as monosyllabic or polysyllabic.

words as related to their size based on the first mode of analysis.

The table shows that the most frequent preference for the cut-off point in 
monosyllabic source words is between the nucleus and coda. For 
polysyllabic source words, the table shows that the most frequent locations 
of cut-off points are:

The table shows that the most frequent locations of cut-off points in 
monosyllabic source words are between the onset and nucleus and inside 
the coda. For polysyllabic source words, the table shows that the most 
frequent locations of cut-off points are: 
 
- at a syllable boundary;  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 1st syllable of the source 
word; and 
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source 
word. 
 
Based on the results in Table 5.26 and Table 5.27, it is clear that there 
is a general tendency for the cut-off point to occur at syllabic joints or 
between syllabic constituents.

Table 5.28 below displays a comparison of the most frequent locations 
of cut-off points in all of the source words as related to their size based on

The comparison in this table shows that, based on both modes of analyses, 
the general tendency for monosyllabic source words is to have the cut-off 
point at a phonological joint, usually between nucleus and coda or between 
onset and nucleus. In the second mode of analysis, the least preferred 
option in monosyllabic source words is for it to occur within a syllabic 
constituent, namely inside the coda. Meanwhile, for polysyllabic source 
words and based on both modes of analyses, with a comparable ordering 
of preferences, there is a general tendency for the cut-off points to occur at 
phonological joints, and mostly at a syllable boundary or between syllabic 
constituents, usually, between the onset and nucleus. 
 
5.3.1.2. Tendencies for Cut-off Points in Responses from the 
Experiment 
 
After examining the responses to the survey as related to cut-off points in 
the source words based on the two different modes of analyses, the 
responses to the experiment were also examined in the same way. Cases of 
blends with overlap contain elements that are found in source words. 
These represent 151 out of 416. The data are analysed based on the two 
modes of analyses, where the first mode of analysis does not show the 
overlap and the second mode of analysis does.

Comparing Table 5.29 and Table 5.30 shows that, based on both 
modes of analyses, there are combinations of cut-off points that are 
frequent and others that are not. It is also noted that there are preferences 
for having certain combinations of cut-off points based on one mode of 
analysis over others based on the other mode of analysis, as is the case, for 
instance, with the combination between the nucleus and coda + at a 
syllable boundary, which is a frequent combination based on the first 
mode of analysis that appears less frequent based on the second mode of 
analysis. 
Table 5.31 below shows a comparison of the most frequent 
combinations of cut-off points in responses from the experiment showing 
the results based on the first mode of analysis and the second mode of 
analysis. The combinations of cut-off points are listed in each column 
based on their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

This comparison also shows that four combinations are commonly found 
in both modes of analyses, which are: 
 
- between the nucleus and coda + at a syllable boundary; 
- between the nucleus and coda + between the onset and nucleus;  
- at a syllable boundary + at a syllable boundary; and 
- at a syllable boundary + between the onset and nucleus.

5.3.1.2.ii. Types of fusion at the split points in blends 
 
Variation in the types of fusion at the split points in the blends caused by 
having different combinations of cut-off points in the source words was 
also examined in responses from the experiment based on both modes of 
analyses.  
Table 5.32 below displays variations in the types of fusion at the split 
points in blends in the experiment based on the first mode of analysis.

The table shows that the most frequent types of fusion at split points in the 
blends are resyllabification, syllabic maintenance, and onset replacement. 
From a comparison of the types of fusion at the split points in blends in 
Table 5.32 and Table 5.33, we can see that the two most frequent types of 
fusion for both modes of analyses are resyllabification and syllabic 
maintenance. The next most frequent preference for the type of fusion in 
blends of the experiment based on the second mode of analysis is onset 
replacement. Table 5.34 below summarises the types of fusion at split 
points in responses from the experiment comparing the results shown in 
Table 5.32 and Table 5.33. The types of fusion are listed in each column 
based on their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

5.3.1.2.iii. Patterns of fracto-lexemes  
 
The combinations of cut-off points in source words of responses to the 
experiment were then examined based on the two different modes of 
analyses. It is found that the results for the patterns of fracto-lexemes do 
not change. When considering the locations of fracto-lexemes in the 
source words, the results show that, for most of the responses, the fore part 
from the first source word and the hind part from the second source word 
are joined to form the blend.  
The patterns of fracto-lexemes can be displayed following the 
structural pattern of AB+CD proposed by Plag (2003) for the analysis of 
blends in English, in addition to being displayed following the pattern 
adopted in the current work, as displayed earlier in Table 5.3. 
Table 5.35 below displays the combinations of locations of the fracto-
lexemes in the source words in responses from the experiment.

The table also shows six patterns for the locations of the fracto-lexemes in the 
source words of the blends, with the combination initial + final (i.e. pattern AD) 
as the most frequent preference. It is noteworthy to mention that the last two 
patterns in this table do not exist in English. This could be an interesting 
observation had these patterns been supported by more data in further research. 
It is worth mentioning at this point that although it has not been identified 
in the established Arabic blends that there are patterns like BD and BC, it is 
still possible to attribute these patterns to the participantsâ preference to adopt 
a new tendency for joining the fracto-lexemes they fancied from the source 
words. BD and BC structures could be peculiar to Arabic: according to Lehrer 
(2007, 117-120), English blends can be formed from the beginning of two 
words, e.g. Mexicali < Mexico + California, but âthe beginning of a blend 
cannot be the end of a wordâ, e.g. *glyson < ugly + person. 
 
5.3.1.2.iv. Locations of cut-off points in source words while referring to 
their position in the blend 
 
The combinations of cut-off points also reflect the locations of the cut-off 
point in each source word of the word pair; that is, the preference for the 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
127 
cut-off point in the first source word and that in the second source word. 
Table 5.36 below displays the locations of cut-off points in the first and 
second source words in the responses to the experiment based on the first 
mode of analysis.

The table shows that the most frequent locations of the cut-off point in the 
first source word are: 
 
- between the nucleus and coda;  
- at a syllable boundary;  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source 
word; and  
- between the onset and nucleus.  
 
As for the cut-off point in the second source word, the table shows that 
the most frequent preferences are: 
 
- at a syllable boundary;

The locations of cut-off points in SW1s and SW2s are all compiled 
together in one table to identify the locations of cut-off points in all of the 
source words of responses regardless of their position in the blend.

The table shows that the most frequent locations of cut-off points in all of 
the source words are: 
 
- at a syllable boundary;  
- between the onset and nucleus; 
- at word boundaries; 
- inside the coda;  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 1st syllable of the source 
word; and  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source 
word. 
 
When the most frequent locations of cut-off points in all of the source 
words in Table 5.38 and Table 5.39 are compared, it is found that there are 
locations of cut-off points that are common to both modes of analyses. 
Table 5.40 below displays the comparison of the locations of cut-off points 
in all of the source words of responses to the experiment based on both 
modes of analyses. The locations of cut-off points are listed in each 
column based on their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

The table shows that there are four frequent locations of cut-off points that 
are commonly found in the whole data based on both modes of analyses, 
which are: 
 
- at a syllable boundary 
- at word boundaries 
- between the onset and nucleus  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word  
 
The table also shows that the most frequent preference for the cut-off 
point based on the first mode of analysis does not appear amongst the 
preferences for cut-off points based on the second mode of analysis and 
that the fourth preference based on the second mode of analysis is not 
found amongst the preferences based on the first mode of analysis.  
 
5.3.1.2.vi. Locations of cut-off points in source words while referring to 
their size 
 
The results also show that there is a relationship between the cut-off point 
and the size of the source word. Although there is a general tendency for 
cut-off points to occur mostly at phonological joints, there is some 
variation in cut-off points in the source words in terms of the number of 
their syllables. 
To examine the relationship between the cut-off point and the size of 
the source word and to determine if there is a difference in the results 
when considering cases with obvious single fusion points as opposed to 
when considering cases of overlap, the results from both modes of 
analyses of responses to the experiment are considered. The size of a 
source word is again measured in terms of the number of its syllables as

monosyllabic or polysyllabic.

The table shows that the most frequent location of the cut-off point in 
monosyllabic source words is between the onset and nucleus, with 
152/399 (38%) SWs showing this preference and the most frequent 
locations of cut-off points in polysyllabic source words are at a syllable 
boundary, with 200/433 (46%) SWs showing this preference, and between 
the onset and nucleus, with 83/433 (19%) SWs having the cut-off point in 
the first syllable and 83/433 (19%) in the second. 
After comparing the results in Table 5.41 and Table 5.42, it is found 
that there is no change in the most frequent locations of the cut-off point in 
monosyllabic and polysyllabic source words based on both modes of 
analyses. It is generally the case that cut-off points occur at syllabic joints 
or between syllabic constituents.  
Table 5.43 below displays a comparison of the most frequent locations 
of cut-off points in source words as related to their size based on the two 
modes of analyses. The locations of cut-off points are listed in each 

Blending, from English to Arabic

column based on their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

The comparison in this table shows that, based on both modes of analyses, 
the general tendency for monosyllabic source words is to have the cut-off 
point at a phonological joint, usually between the nucleus and coda based 
on the first mode of analysis, and between the onset and nucleus based on 
the second mode of analysis. Meanwhile, for polysyllabic source words 
and based on both modes of analyses, there is a general tendency for cut-
off points to occur also at phonological joints, with a comparable ordering 
for the first most frequent preference, which is at the syllable boundary or 
between syllabic constituents, with a reversed ordering for the second and 
third most frequent preferences, which are between the onset and nucleus 
with a preference for it to occur in the first syllable or the second syllable. 
 
5.3.1.3. Cut-off Points in Novel Invented Blends: A Summary 
 
This section summarises the findings for the tendencies related to the 
feature of cut-off points in source words of the 469 (53 from the survey 
and 416 from the experiment) responses examined for this feature, 
henceforth referred to as the cut-off dataset.  
Table 5.44 below displays the most frequent combinations of cut-off 
points in this dataset based on both modes of analyses. The combinations 
are listed based on their order of frequency from the highest to the lowest.

This comparison shows that there are seven combinations of cut-off points 
(marked in bold) that are commonly found based on both modes of 
analyses. 
The comparison also shows that, based on the first mode of analysis, 
the combinations that include cut-off points at phonological joints are less 
frequent within the preferences based on the second mode of analysis, as is 
the case with the combination between the nucleus and coda + at a syllable 
boundary, or disappear altogether, as is the case, for instance, with the 
combination at a syllable boundary + between the nucleus and coda. On 
the other hand, combinations that include cut-off points within syllabic 
constituents based on the second mode of analysis are either not frequent 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
137 
based on the first mode of analysis, as is the case, for instance, with the 
combination inside the coda + between the onset and nucleus, or are less 
frequent as is the case, for instance, with the combination inside the coda + 
at a syllable boundary. 
Table 5.45 below displays the most frequent types of fusion at split 
points in the cut-off dataset based on both modes of analyses. The 
preferences for the types of fusion are listed based on their order of 
frequency from the highest to the lowest.

This comparison shows that the same types of fusion are commonly found 
in both modes of analyses. The comparison also shows that for the cut-off 
dataset and based on both modes of analyses, the same two types of fusion 
(marked in bold) are more common than the remaining types. Meanwhile, 
the other types appear to have different orderings of preferences in the two 
modes of analyses.  
The combinations of the patterns of fracto-lexemes can also be 
displayed here following the structural pattern of AB+CD proposed by 
Plag (2003) for the analysis of blends in English, in addition to being 
displayed following the pattern adopted in the current work, as displayed 
in Table 5.3. 
Table 5.46 below displays the combinations of the locations of fracto-
lexemes in the source words in responses from the survey.

The results in this table show six patterns of fracto-lexemes of the blends, 
with the combination initial + final (i.e. pattern AD) as the most frequent 
preference. The last two patterns, as was shown earlier in Table 5.35, do 
not exist in English. This means that they could be peculiar to Arabic. 
Regarding the locations of cut-off points in the source words of the 
cut-off dataset, while referring to their ordering in the blend, the 
preferences for cut-off points in the first source word based on the first 
mode of analysis are compared to those based on the second mode of 
analysis. Table 5.47 below displays this comparison.

5. Results and Discussion 
140 
This comparison shows that four of the most frequent locations of cut-off 
points in the first source word are commonly found in both modes of 
analyses, which are: 
 
- between the nucleus and coda;  
- at a syllable boundary; 
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source 
word; and 
- between the onset and nucleus. 
 
It is also shown that the most frequent location of the cut-off point 
based on the first mode of analysis, which is between the nucleus and 
coda, becomes less frequent based on the second mode of analysis and that 
one of the least frequent locations based on the first mode of analysis, 
which is inside the coda, becomes the most frequent one based on the 
second mode of analysis. This comparison also shows that there are two 
locations of the cut-off point whose order of preference does not change, 
which are at a syllable boundary and between the onset and nucleus of the 
2nd syllable of the source word.  
The locations of cut-off points in the second source word based on the 
first mode of analysis were also compared to those in the second source 
word based on the second mode of analysis. Table 5.48 below displays this 
comparison.

This comparison shows that three of the most frequent locations of cut-off 
points in the second source word are commonly found in both modes of 
analyses, which are: 
 
- at a syllable boundary; 
- at word boundaries; and 
- between the onset and nucleus of the 1st syllable of the source 
word. 
 
It is also shown that the second most frequent preference for the cut-off 
point based on the first mode of analysis, which is between the nucleus 
and coda, becomes less frequent based on the second mode of analysis, 
and that preference which is amongst the least frequent ones based on the 
first mode of analysis, between the onset and nucleus, becomes the most 
frequent one based on the second mode of analysis. This comparison also 
shows that, apart from the most frequent preferences that are not common 
to both modes of analyses, the preference for the cut-off point at the 
syllable boundary is the most frequent.  

5. Results and Discussion

The locations of cut-off points in the source words of the cut-off 
dataset were then all compiled for both modes of analyses to identify the 
most frequent preferences regardless of their ordering in the blend.  
The locations of cut-off points in the source words of all responses in 
the cut-off dataset based on both modes of analyses are summarised and 
compared in Table 5.49 below.

This comparison shows that six of the most frequent locations of cut-off 
points in all of the source words are commonly found based on both 
modes of analyses, although with a different order of frequency, which 
are: 
 
- between the nucleus and coda;  
- at a syllable boundary; 
- at word boundaries; 
- between the onset and nucleus;  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source 
word; and  
- between the onset and nucleus of the 1st syllable of the source word 
 
The most frequent location of the cut-off point based on the first mode 
of analysis is between the nucleus and coda, whereas the most frequent 
location of the cut-off point based on the second mode of analysis is at a 
syllable boundary. Additionally, the location of the cut-off point inside the 
coda appears within the most frequent ones based on the second mode of 
analysis but not based on the first mode of analysis. Moreover, the location 
of a cut-off point at a syllable boundary has the same level of frequency 
based on both modes of analyses. 
The locations of cut-off points in the source words of the cut-off 
dataset as related to their size based on both modes of analyses are 
summarised and compared in 3.5.2 below.

This comparison shows that the most frequent location of the cut-off point 
in the monosyllabic source words based on the first mode of analysis is 
between the nucleus and coda and that the most frequent location of the 
cut-off point in the monosyllabic source word based on the second mode 
of analysis is between the onset and nucleus. 
 
 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
145 
Meanwhile, the most frequent location of the cut-off point in 
polysyllabic source words is at a syllable boundary that has the same 
ordering and level of frequency based on both modes of analyses. The 
remaining most frequent locations, which are between the onset and 
nucleus of the 2nd syllable of the source word and between the onset and 
nucleus of the 1st syllable of the source word, are both common based on 
both modes of analyses, although with a reversed ordering of frequency. 
The results suggest that it is generally the case that novel Arabic blends 
have a cut-off point between syllabic constituents, preferably between the 
onset and the nucleus, or at a syllable boundary.  
The discussion now turns to an examination of the proportion of 
phonemic contribution from source words to blends.  
5.3.2. Proportional Contributions from Source Words to Blends 
This section examines the proportions of contribution from source words 
to blends. Two major tendencies relating to this feature have been 
identified in English blends (see section 3.5.2.) and are considered in this 
discussion. Both tendencies relate to the length of the source words, 
measured in terms of the number of phonemes. Firstly, it is generally the 
case for English blends that the greater proportion of contribution comes 
from the shorter source word (Kaunisto 2000, 49-50). Secondly, when 
source words have equal length, it is generally the case that there are equal 
proportions of contribution from both source words to the blend (Gries 
2004b, 654).  
The blends examined here are only the fully diacritised responses from 
the survey (59 responses) and the experiment (503 responses). These cases 
provide a complete representation of the structure of the blends. 
Furthermore, since this book counts overlapping segments as common to 
both source words, blends are analysed based on the second mode of 
analysis only. 
Of the nine word-pairs given as stimuli in the survey, seven included 
source words with different phonemic lengths, such as /zajt/ âoilâ and 
/zaÝ§.tar/ âthymeâ, while the other two included source words of equal 
phonemic length, as in /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and /xubz/ âbreadâ.  
The formula used by Kaunisto (2000, 49) to measure the proportional 
contributions of source words to blends is used to measure the proportional 
contributions from source words to blends from the whole data.  
To explain how the blends are analysed, three are analysed below as 
samples of those having the greater proportional contributions from the 
shorter SW, or the longer SW, and for those having equal contributions

5.3.2.1. Tendencies for Proportional Contributions from Source 
Words to Blends from the Survey 
 
The same coding template as in Table 5.10 is used to display the frequency 
of proportional contributions from source words to blends in responses 
from the survey and the experiment.  
The proportional contributions from source words to blends were 
calculated following the formula in section 3.5.2, and the results show that 
the greater proportional contribution tends to come from the shorter source 
word. All 59 responses in the survey were analysed following the process 
implemented by Gries (2004b, 651). 
Table 5.51 below displays the proportional contributions of the source 
words to blends from the survey.

The results in this table show that 28 (47%) of the responses have SW1 
shorter than SW2, 20 (34%) have an SW2 shorter than SW1, and 11 (19%) 
have both source words of equal phonemic length.  
The results show that the greater proportional contribution tends to 
come from the shorter source word, with 17/28 (61%) of the responses 
with SW1<SW2 having the greater proportional contributions from SW1, 
as in /dÝ¤u.ban/ < /dÝ¤ub_QDQGOD_ban/; and 16/20 (80%) of the responses 
with SW1>SW2 having the greater proportional contribution from SW2, 

5. Results and Discussion 
148 
as in /da.ma:Ý¦/ < /da._ZDÝ¦/ and /ma:Ý¦/. This amounts to 33/48 (69%) of 
the total responses to these two sets of word pairs, representing 56% of the 
overall number of responses to the survey (33/59 responses). 
The results also show that the source words that have equal phonemic 
lengths contribute equal proportions to the blend, with 10/11 (91%) of the 
responses with SW1=SW2 showing this preference, as in /xu.bun/ < 
/xub_]DQGGÝ¤_ubn/. 
The results show three main preferences for the proportional 
contributions from all source words to the blends. Firstly, the highest 
preference is for the greater proportional contribution to come from SW2, 
with 27/59 (46%) of the responses showing this preference, with the 
highest frequency for the shorter source word in 16/27 (60%) of the 
responses showing this tendency. Secondly, there is a preference to have 
the greater proportional contribution from SW1, with 21/59 (36%), with 
the highest frequency for the shorter source word in 17/21 (81%) of the 
responses showing this tendency. Thirdly, the least preferred option for the 
proportional contribution is to have both source words contribute equally 
to the blend with 11/59 (19%) of the responses showing this tendency. 
This is especially true of source words that have equal phonemic length 
forming 10/11 (91%) of the responses to this set of word pairs. 
However, when both the left-hand column and the top line in Table 
5.51 are considered, the results show that the length of the source word is 
more influential than its position in the blend, which is clearly shown 
when considering that only 14/48 (29%) of the responses to source words 
of different phonemic lengths have the greater proportional contribution 
coming from the longer source word. Four of twenty (20%) of the 
responses with SW1>SW2 have a greater proportional contribution from 
SW1, as in Æ«DOLEDM  Æ«DOLE/ and /Ý_a:j/, and 10/28 (36%) of the 
responses with SW1<SW2 have the greater proportional contribution from 
SW2, as in /ta.ban/ < /ta_PUDQGO_a.ban/.  
 
5.3.2.2. Tendencies for Proportional Contributions from Source 
Words to Blends from the Experiment 
 
The formula for calculating the proportional contributions from source 
words to blends was then applied to the data from the experiment, and the 
results show that there is a preference for the greater proportional 
contribution to come from the shorter source word in the blend. All 503 
responses from the experiment were analysed following the process 
implemented by Gries.

The results in this table show that 208 (42%) of the responses have an 
SW1 shorter than SW2, 200 (40%) have an SW2 shorter than SW1, and 95 
(19%) have both source words of equal phonemic length. 
The results also show a preference for the greater proportional 
contribution to come from the shorter source word, with 121/208 (58%) of 
the responses with SW1<SW2 having the greater proportional contribution 
from SW1, as in /dÝ¤u.ban/ < /dÝ¤ub_Q DQG OD_ban/; and 144/200 (72%)

DV LQ WÞ«DPMDU  WÞ«DP_DWÞ«LP DQG [L_ja:r/. This amounts to 265/408 
(65%) of the total responses to these two sets of word pairs, representing 
53% of the overall number of responses to the experiment (265/503 
responses). 
The results also show that the source words that have equal phonemic 
lengths contribute equal proportions to the blend, with 56/95 (59%) of the 
responses with SW1=SW2 showing this preference, as in /di:n.la:r/ < 
/di:.n_DU and GX_la:r/. 
The results show three preferences for the proportional contributions 
from all source words to the blends. Firstly, the highest frequency is for 
the greater proportional contribution to come from SW2, with 258/503 
(51%) of the responses showing this tendency, with the highest frequency 
for the shorter source word in 144/258 (56%) of the responses showing 
this tendency. Secondly, the greater proportional contribution tends to 

5. Results and Discussion 
150 
come from SW1, at 184/503 (37%), with the highest frequency for the 
shorter source word in 121/184 (66%) of the responses showing this 
tendency. Thirdly, both source words contribute equal proportions to the 
blend, with 61/503 (12%) of the responses showing this tendency; and this 
is especially the case with source words that have equal phonemic length, 
representing 56/61 (95%) of the responses to this set of word pairs. 
However, when both axes are considered, the results show that the 
length of the source word is more important than its order in the blend, 
which is clearly shown when considering that only 138/408 (34%) of the 
responses to source words of different phonemic lengths have the greater 
proportional contribution to come from the longer source word. Only 
53/200 (27%) of the responses with SW1>SW2 have the greater 
proportional contribution coming from SW1, as in /la.bar/ < /la.ba_QDQG
WDP_r/; and 85/208 (41%) of responses with SW1<SW2 have the greater 
proportional contribution from SW2, as in /ma.wa:Ý¦/ < /m_DÝ¦/ and 
G_a.wa:Ý¦/.  
The findings of the analysis of data from the experiment support those 
from the survey. It is generally the case that the greater proportional 
contribution to the blend comes from the shorter source word, which is 
mostly the second source word, as shown in Table 5.52. 
 
5.3.2.3. Proportional Contributions from Source Words to Novel 
Invented Blends: A Summary 
 
This section summarises the findings for tendencies related to examining 
the feature of the proportional contributions from source words in the 562 
(59 from the survey and 503 from the experiment) responses examined, 
henceforth referred to as the proportional contribution dataset.  
Table 5.53 below gives a summary of the results for the proportional 
contributions from source words to blends in the proportional contribution 
dataset.

The table shows two main preferences for the proportional contributions 
from source words to blends. Firstly, it is generally the case that the 
greater contribution comes from the shorter source word, as shown by the 
frequencies of 58% and 73% for SW1 and SW2 respectively. Secondly, 
there is a tendency for the source words that have equal phonemic lengths 
to contribute equal proportions to the blend, as shown by the frequency of 
62%. 
5.3.3. Stress Patterns of Blends 
This section discusses the stress patterns of blends from the survey in 
section 5.3.3.1 and the experiment in section 5.3.3.2 following the same 
method used in examining the established Arabic blends in section 5.2.3.3. 
Section 5.3.3.3 concludes with a summary of the results and findings from 
both datasets. 
Since stress patterns cannot be assigned unless words are phonemically 
fully represented, only the fully diacritised responses from the survey (59 
responses) and the fully vowelised responses from the experiment (503 
responses) are suitable to be examined for this feature. Cases of 
monosyllabic responses are not included in this examination, for obvious 
reasons.  
Table 3.1 for stress assignment in English blends (discussed in section 
3.5.3) is used to summarise the results for analysing the novel blends in 
terms of the feature of stress pattern. The same aspects considered for 

5. Results and Discussion 
152
discussing the stress patterns of established Arabic blends are also used in 
this discussion, which are: 
 
- Whether the blend has a syllabic size different from/similar to that 
of both or either source word; and 
- Whether the blend exhibits a stress pattern different from/similar to 
that of either source word. 
 
As also mentioned in section 5.2.3.3, the stress pattern of Arabic words 
is determined by their prosodic pattern. Nevertheless, it is noticed in the 
data from the survey and the experiment that blends tend to have a stress 
pattern that is identical to that of the source word of the same syllabic size. 
 
5.3.3.1. Tendencies for the Stress Patterns of Blends from the Survey 
 
This section discusses the stress patterns of blends from the survey. Of the 
fully diacritised responses (59 responses) from the survey, 51 responses 
from the dataset are examined for this feature, since 8 monosyllabic 
responses are excluded from the data. Of the 51 blends, 48 (94%) have 
source words of different syllabic sizes and 3 (6%) only have source words 
of identical syllabic size. 
After examining this feature in blends from the survey, it is found that 
there is a tendency for the blend to have the same stress pattern as that of 
the second source word, especially when the blend has a syllabic size 
identical to that of this source word. 
Table 5.54 below displays the stress patterns of the responses from the 
survey while referring to the syllabic size of the source words as having 
identical or different sizes.  
The results show that when both source words have different syllabic 
sizes, there is a preference for the blends that have a syllabic size identical 
to that of the second source word to have also a stress pattern identical to 
that of this source word.

When considering the frequencies based on the (non-)identity of stress 
position in blends and the source words shown in column 5 of Table 5.54 
and without reference to the syllabic size of both source words shown in 
column 1 of the same table, or the syllabic size of blends to source words 
shown in column 3 of the same table, the results also support this 
tendency. 
Table 5.55 below displays the overall results regarding the stress 
patterns of blends from the survey.

5.3.3.2. Tendencies for Stress Patterns of Blends from the Experiment 
 
This section discusses the stress patterns of blends from the experiment. 
Of the fully vowelised responses (503 responses) from the experiment, 
422 responses from the dataset examined for this feature, since 81 
monosyllabic responses are excluded from the data. Of the 422 blends, 
366 (87%) have source words of different syllabic sizes and 56 (13%) 
have source words of identical syllabic sizes. 
After examining this feature in blends from the experiment, it is found 
that there is a tendency for the blends to have a stress pattern that is 
identical to that of the source word that has a syllabic size identical to that 
of the blend. 
Table 5.56 below displays the stress patterns of the responses from the 
experiment while referring to the syllabic size of the source words as 
having identical or different sizes.

The results show three main preferences for the stress patterns of blends 
from the responses to the experiment. Two of them fall within the dataset 
with source words that have different syllabic sizes and one within the 
dataset with source words that have identical syllabic sizes.  
When the source words have different syllabic sizes, there is a 
preference for the blends that have a syllabic size that is identical to that of 
either source word to have also a stress pattern that is identical to that of 
this source word; and when both source words have identical syllabic 
sizes, there is a preference for the blends that have a syllabic size different 
from either source word to have also a stress pattern that is different from 
that of either source word.  
When considering the frequencies based on the (non-)identity of stress 
position in blends and SWs that are shown in column 5 of Table 5.56 and 
without reference to the syllabic size of both source words shown in 
column 1 of the same table, or the syllabic size of blends to SWs shown in 
column 3 of the same table, the results also support this tendency. 
Table 5.57 below displays the overall results regarding stress patterns 
of blends from the experiment.

The table shows two tendencies for stress patterns in blends. Most blends 
(47%) tend to have a stress pattern that is identical to that of the second 
source word, and 28% of the blends tend to have a stress pattern that is 
different from that of either source word.

from the experiment (422 responses), henceforth referred to as the stress 
pattern dataset. Overall, 473 responses constitute this dataset.

The results show five preferences for the stress patterns of established 
Arabic blends. Two of them fall within the dataset of source words that 
have identical syllabic sizes and three within the dataset with source words 
that have different syllabic sizes.  
When the source words have different syllabic sizes, there is a high 
preference for the blends that have a syllabic size that is identical to that of 
either source word to have also a stress pattern that is identical to that of 
this source word; and for the blends that have a syllabic size different from 
that of both source words to have also a stress pattern that is different from 
that of both source words. 
When both source words have identical syllabic sizes, there is a 
preference for the blends that have a syllabic size different from either 
source word to have also a stress pattern that is different from that of either 
source word, and a preference for the blends that have a syllabic size that 
is identical to that of both source words to have a stress pattern that is also 
identical to that of both source words.

When considering the preferences based on the (non-)identity of stress 
position in blends and SWs shown in column 5 of Table 5.58 and without 
reference to the syllabic size of both source words shown in column 1 of 
the same table, or the syllabic size of blends to SWs shown in column 3 of 
the same table, the results also support this tendency. 
Table 5.59 below displays the overall results regarding stress patterns 
of blends from the stress pattern dataset.

The table shows two tendencies for stress patterns of blends. The first 
tendency is for blends to have a stress pattern that is identical to that of the 
second source word, and the second tendency is for blends to have a stress 
pattern that is different from that of either source word. 
5.4. Further Observations  
This section presents some further observations about the data from the 
survey and the experiment. Section 5.4.1 discusses the cases of 
homography/homophony in the data, section 5.4.2 discusses reversed 
responses, section 5.4.3 discusses blends that included short vowels not 
found in either source word, and finally, section 5.4.4 discusses potential 
cases of sandwich blends in the data. 
5.4.1. Cases of Homophonous Responses 
The literature shows that some English blends seem to be blocked because 
they would be homophonous to existing words (Bauer 1983), such as dang 
< damn and hang, which is formed in such a way to avoid having the 
potential blend hamn which might be confused with ham (Gleitman and 
Gleitman 2000, 319). Nevertheless, some blends are found to be 
homophonous to existing words, like the blend faction < fact and fiction 
meaning âcampâ (Fischer 1998, 98).  

5. Results and Discussion 
160 
The distinction between homographs and homophones found in the 
collected data relates to whether or not the responses included diacritics 
(for the written responses) and fully pronounced with short vowels (for the 
spoken responses).  
 Several responses from the data of this book appeared identical 
(graphemically or phonemically) to existing words in Arabic. As 
mentioned in section 2.3.3, there is variation in the diacritisation of the 
responses to the survey: undiacritised, partially diacritised, and fully 
diacritised responses. The first two types of responses were considered 
orthographically since they either lack all diacritics or have incomplete 
diacritisation. These cases of responses are called homographic blends.  
As for the fully diacritised responses from the survey and the responses 
from the experiment that are phonemically identical to existing words, 
these are called homophonous blends. 
To be judged homographic or homophonous, all responses in the 
whole data were checked in the Arabic Dictionary of Meanings (2010) 
(accessed via https://www.almaany.com), a comprehensive Arabic online 
dictionary that provides all existing Arabic words with their etymology, 
derivatives, and diacritisation. The entry in the dictionary that has an 
identical root to that of each checked blend was taken to be the one 
intended for the meaning of this homoform. Accordingly, all these 
homoforms are treated in the following table as being homophonous 
forms.  
Of the 1483 responses (survey 980 and experiment 503), 262 (18%) 
responses reflect homographic and homophonous forms of existing words 
in Arabic. 187 responses are from the survey and 75 are from the 
experiment. Of the 262 responses, 165 responses reflecting homographic 
forms, which are all from the survey, and 97 responses reflecting 
homophonous forms, with 22 responses from the survey and 75 responses 
from the experiment.  
Table 5.60 below displays the frequency of responses to the survey that 
reflect homographic blends to existing words in Arabic. The responses are 
listed from the most frequent to the least.

5. Results and Discussion 
162 
Having these types of responses in the datasets could indicate that 
informants might not know that these are already existing words in Arabic. 
Secondly, informants could probably know that their responses are 
existing words but they deliberately formed their novel blends while 
referring to a new meaning creating by that a new homonym. This goes 
against Aronoffâs (1976, 43) notion of âblockingâ, according to which the 
formation of a new (blend) word that happens to be identical to an existing 
one would be blocked, thus avoiding ambiguity. Nevertheless, homonymy 
is a typical phenomenon of Arabic where one lexeme has multiple 
meanings. Thirdly, there might be closeness in the meaning of either of the 
source words or both to the newly formed blend, which could have given 
the informants a motivation to make these forms as blends for the given 
source words. Fourthly, and more importantly, informants could have been 
avoiding violating the phonotactic rules of Arabic and hence resorting to 
already existing words whether they were aware of their existence in 
Arabic or not. 
After examining the responses in the whole dataset, the results show 
that the word pair that has the most frequent response reflecting an 
identical form to an existing Arabic word is /dÝ¤ubn/ and /xubz/ with 
57/262 (22%) of the responses reflecting this form. 
Of all the homoforms in the whole data, only 2 responses show a 
meaning relationship with the meanings of the source words that could be 
interpreted as being a justification for using these forms as blends for the 
given word pairs. These responses are the homophonous blend /dÝ¤u.ban/ < 
/dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ and /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and the homographic (partially 
diacritised) blend /lubn/ < /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ. The 
meaning of the response /dÝ¤u.ban/ âcheese (pl.)â is close to the meaning of 
the source word /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ, and the meaning of the response /lubn/ 
connotes the meaning of both source words /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ 
âcheeseâ, meaning mammals that usually feed their children with milk, 
which is the basic material from which both yoghurt and cheese are made.  
The other homophonous blends in Table 5.60 have meanings that are 
completely different from those of the source words. Overall, therefore, it 
appears that the existence of a homophone word does not block the 
creation of a specific blend, cf. (Aronoff 1976, 43). The meaning relation 
between the homophone word and the blend in the case of /dÝ¤u.ban/ and 
/lubn/ is probably fortuitous.

5.4.2. Cases of Blends with Reversed Ordering of Source Words 
It is useful to mention at this point a noteworthy observation related to the 
ordering of the source words in the responses to both the survey and the 
experiment. Two lists of word pairs (having two different orderings for the 
same source words) were given as stimuli. The informantsâ responses are 
expected to reflect the ordering of the source words as they were presented 
in the given word pairs. Nevertheless, some responses are âreversedââ
that is, the source words are blended not in the order in which they are 
presented to the informants, namely SWI-SWII, but in the reversed order, 
namely SWII-SWI. These responses are referred to in this book as 
âreversed blendsâ.  
In the total of 1483 responses, there are 114 reversed blends, with 35 
given to the first ordering of word pairs and 79 to the second ordering of 
word pairs. Of the 114 reversed blends, 100 are from the survey, with 68 
given to the first ordering and 32 to the second ordering; and 14 from the 
experiment, with 3 given to the first ordering and 11 to the second 
ordering. 
An example from the survey is the reversed blend /dÝ¤u.ban/ given as a 
response to the word pair /la.ban/ âyoghurtâ and /dÝ¤ubn/ âcheeseâ, and an 
example from the experiment is the reversed blend /Ýa.li:b/ given as a 
response to the word pair Æ«a.li:b/ âmilkâ and /Ýa:j/ âteaâ. These cases of 
reversed blends seem to reflect the English tendency to have the shorter 
source word first, which could indicate some kind of influence by the 
English blend-formation patterns. 
Table 5.61 below displays the frequency of reversed blends in the 
whole dataset of the novel, invented blends.

The results show that the frequency of reversed blends is higher in the 
responses given to the second ordering, where informants appear to prefer 
to use the first ordering they were presented with over the second one. 
They also seem to have used the same blend they formed for the first 
ordering of a word pair when given the reversed ordering of the same 
word pair, rather than forming a different blend. 

5. Results and Discussion 
164 
The existence of reversed blends in the collected data for this book 
shows that blending in Arabic sometimes does not obey the given ordering 
of the source words, especially when there is no conventional temporal or 
sequential ordering that requires the blend maker to maintain this ordering. 
For example, the blend /dÝ§ab.xan/ Ï¦Ë´Î¨Ë¸ÎË´Î¿ âsmogâ is formed from /dÝ§a.ba:b/ 
ÎÎÎË´Î¿ âfogâ and /dux.xa:n/ Ï¥ÎÎ§ËµÎ© âsmokeâ, whose order does not reflect the 
temporal or sequential relationship. This is an interesting case as compared 
to English smog. 
Nevertheless, the two established Arabic blends /dÝ¤aw.qal/ < /na.qal/ 
and /dÝ¤aw/, and /haw.mal/ âairborneâ < /ha.wa:Ý¦/ and Æ«DPDO have the 
ordering of the source words reversed although they are part of a syntactic 
structure where the verb Æ«DPDO is followed by an object /ha.wa:Ý¦/. 
5.4.3. Cases of Blends with New Added Short Vowels  
As discussed in section 2.3.3, it is usually the case in Arabic that short 
vowels are represented by diacritics placed over or below the graphemes. 
The short vowels usually form the nucleus of a syllable whose onset is 
represented by this grapheme. 
The fully diacritised responses from the survey (59 responses) and the 
fully vowelised responses from the experiment (503 response) included 
cases of blends that have new short vowels, i.e. vowels not found in either 
source word. Overall, 49 responses have new short vowels (2 from the 
survey, 47 from the experiment). 
The cases of blends in the data that include new short vowels either 
have all the short vowels completely new or a combination of short vowels 
contributed from the source words and new short vowels added to the 
consonants contributed from the source words.  
An example from the survey is the blend [LMDWÞ«XP/ < /xi.ja:r/ 
âcucumberâ and WÞ«DPa:WÞ«LP/ âtomatoâ with the short vowel /u/ not 
coming from either source word. An example from the experiment is the 
blend /ti.bin/ < /la.ban/ and /tamr/, a reversed blend with completely new 
short vowels added to the blend. 
Table 5.62 below displays all blends in the whole data set containing 
new short vowels (shown through underlining).

The table shows that the most frequent new short vowel is /i/, then come 
/a/ and /u/. The use of /i/ more often may be attributed to the effect of the 
Arabic dialects which tend to frequently use this short vowel.  
The results also show that the most frequent word pairs that have 
responses with new short vowels are /dÝ¤ubn/ and /xubz/, /dÝ¤ubn/ and 
/la.ban/, and /tamr/ and /la.ban/ in both given orderings.  
Table 5.63 below summarises the results as to the word pairs that are

The table shows that the first three lines with both orderings of the source 
words have the most frequent responses with new vowels added by the 
informants. There is no clear reason for this tendency, but it could be 
because these words are so commonly used in our daily life to the extent 
that using them is affected by the dialect where the vowel /i/ is commonly 
inserted to avoid producing consonant clusters.  
5.4.4. Cases of Sandwich Blends  
Arabic blends, whether formed following the classical root-and-pattern 
method or the concatenation method, generally do not have a fracto-
lexeme from one source word sandwiched within the other source word, as 
it is found in English (discussed in section 1.1.1). Nevertheless, there are a 
few cases like that in the novel, invented blends of this book.  
Of the overall data (1483 responses), 19 (1.28%) responses are 
sandwich blends: 11 blends from the survey, and 8 blends from the 
experiment. All cases of sandwich blends from the survey are 
undiacritised responses, where graphemes are cut from one source word

and sandwiched into the other, whereas those from the experiment are all 
fully vowelised. In these cases of responses, source words have multiple 
cut-off points. 
Table 5.64 below displays these cases of sandwich blends from the 
survey.

It is noticed that the blend /zÝ§jtr/ raises an issue related to source word 
recognisability. Unlike English, where one source word is âintercalatedâ 
within the other (e.g. ambiSEXtrous) and entirely recognisable, here it is 
difficult to identify the intercalated source word from just one phoneme in 
the blend (Mattiello 2013, 7, 57). Nevertheless, it could be similar to the 
case of the blend chunnel when âexplained as a combination of the whole 
consonantal skeleton of the form channel plus the vowel of the word 
tunnelâ rather than as a combination of the first segment ch- from channel 
and the last part -unnel from tunnel (Hamans 2010, 455). 
Table 5.65 below displays these cases of sandwich from the 
experiment.

6. CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
6.1. Preliminaries 
The question that initiated this book was: Can we âbrunchâ in other 
languages? Or, more technically: Do native speakers of other languages 
form blends in the same way that English blends are formed? 
Blends in Arabic seem to have received little attention in earlier work 
resulting in the absence of any systematic, quantitative or comparative 
research on them. Accordingly, this language is in a way a convenient 
choice as the target of investigation for a study of the cross-linguistic 
validity of tendencies and principles of blending.  
Moreover, the morphology of Arabic is so fundamentally different 
from that of English that an expectation could arise of dissimilarity in 
blending as well. Hence the choice of English and Arabic seemed 
appropriate in response to the statement by Kaunisto (2013, 6) that â[It] 
might be interesting to examine the structural aspects of blend words in 
different languages in a contrastive or comparative fashionâ. 
Since the most detailed existing research on blending has focused on 
English, the research question addressed in this book was as follows: To 
what extent does blend formation in Arabic follow tendencies that are 
similar to those identified in English?  
The predominantly non-concatenative, root-and-template nature of 
Arabic morphology means that we might expect processes of this nature 
also to be operative in blending. But, are they completely operative? Or, 
does blending in Arabic follow, in any way, the concatenative patterns that 
have been found to govern blending in English and other European 
languages? This is the central issue that this book set out to investigate.  
Arabic is not an exception amongst other languages of the world that 
have been influenced by English whether as an international language or 
as a lingua franca. This means that, as far as this book is concerned, there 
is potential interference from English on the blendersâ decision when 
forming their blends once given potential source words. Therefore, the 
formation of new modern blends according to a concatenative process in 
addition to, or rather than, a non-concatenative, root-and-template one 
could be viewed as âborrowed morphologyâ (Amiridze, Arkadiev and 
Gardani 2015). 

Blending, from English to Arabic 
171 
Amiridze, Arkadiev and Gardani (2015, 1) state that âa high intensity 
of contactâ is ânecessary for morphological borrowing to occurâ. Hence, 
due to language contact, whether âstructurallyâ inspired through studying 
(in) English, or âsociolinguistically inspiredâ through living within an 
English-speaking community in addition to the fact that there is a tendency 
for derivational morphology âto be more susceptible to borrowingâ 
(Amiridze, Arkadiev and Gardani 2015, 9, 17), borrowings from English 
are widespread in Arabic and it might be thought that English-type 
processes would also be used when forming neologisms, including blends, 
in Arabic. 
Moreover, I would add and agree with Dresslerâs (2000, 6) viewpoint 
as to the universality of preferences which he states to be âexpected to 
apply more consistently to extragrammatical phenomena than to the 
morphological rules encapsulated within grammarâ. This means that since 
blending is classified as an extragrammatical morphological phenomenon, 
it is expected to find âuniversal preferencesâ common to various 
languages.  
6.2. Summary of Findings 
Examination of the structure of Arabic blends has revealed that there are 
two methods of forming blends in Arabic. The first method, seen in 
classical Arabic blends and some modern blends, involves the use of the 
root-template type of patterning that is characteristic of Arabic 
morphology in general. Here, the roots of two or more words are involved 
in the combination process and a prosodic pattern is overlaid on them. 
These types of blends can, therefore, be regarded as resulting from the 
prosodic-morphological processes that typically govern word formation in 
Arabic. Yet, many modern Arabic blends appear to exhibit another 
scheme, one that is characterised by the sequential joining of word parts. 
In such cases, there is at work a process of concatenative non-affixational 
derivation of the type found in English and some other European 
languages, which emerges to govern the formation of such words where 
the word-and-pattern formation process is in action, and not root-and-
pattern.  
Three main features of the structure of such concatenative blends in 
Arabic have been investigated in this book: the cut-off points in the source 
words, the proportional contributions from source words to blends, and the 
stress patterns of the blends. Several tendencies have been identified based 
on these features for blends in English and these were used to guide the 
investigation of the Arabic data. 

6. Conclusions 
172
The findings were as follows: 
 
- Most blends in Modern Arabic are characterised by the sequential 
joining of segmentsâfracto-lexemesâfrom their source words, in 
a way where the fore part from the first source word adjoins to the 
last part from the second source word. The concatenative joining 
requires that the source words be cut sequentially at one pointâa 
cut-off point; it is generally the case that the cut-off points occur at 
syllabic joints or between syllabic constituents.  
- The concatenative joining reflects two variants for the length of 
fusion. There is a fusion that occurs at one point, and another that 
expands over many points. The former does not involve common 
elements from the joined segments, in which case, there is no 
potential overlap in the blend, whereas, the latter may involve 
common segments, and definitely show overlap in the blend. 
- The concatenative joining allows for variations in the types of 
fusion where the segments adjoinâvariations that are similar to the 
ones identified in connection with blend formation in English. The 
most common types of fusion are resyllabification, syllabic 
maintenance, and onset replacement. 
- It is generally the case that the greater proportional contribution 
comes from the shorter source word; when the source words have 
equal phonemic lengths, they tend to contribute equal proportions 
to the blend. 
- It is generally the case that the stress pattern of the blend is 
identical to that of the source word that has identical syllabic size 
as that of the blend, and it is mostly the second source word, 
especially with the concatenative blends. 
 
To sum up, these blending patterns could imply that the blenders may 
have been influenced by either or both of the following factors. 
 
- English as an international language: The influence of English is 
evident in all aspects of life like (social) media or entertainment as 
is the case with movies, series, and songs. 
- Language contact: Participants in the study could have been 
influenced by English because they have immediate contact with 
the native speakers of English (since they are living in Newcastle), 
or are studying in English whether in the UK or Iraq, or are 
studying English as a major in Iraq.

NOTES 
 
 
1 /planà±¾tÜ­sà±¾ml/ < /planÜ¼t/ and /Ü¼nfÜ¼nÜ¼tÜ­sÜ¼mÔ¥l/ (Oxford English Dictionary). 
2 Al-)DUÆKÆ¯GL 8-786 AD) was one of the earliest Arab lexicographers and 
philologists.  
3 The reference to âlettersâ reflects the strong focus on written shapes of words in 
traditional Arabic grammar. This in itself is an interesting historiographical 
phenomenon but one outside the scope of this book. I simply reproduce the 
relevant formulations without comment.  
4 /-ij/ is an attributive suffix present in Arabic to indicate kinship. In all similar 
cases of attributive adjectives cited throughout the book, this suffix does not 
contribute to the formation of the blend, and hence is not considered when 
analysing attested blends, especially in cases following the classical pattern of 
forming blends. 
5 /-a/ is a case marker that does not form part of the basic word pattern. 
6 The two source words Ò±abd al-GÆUare given in their non-pausal, context position, 
Ò±DEGLGGÆU 
7 The term word pattern and prosodic pattern are used alternatively to refer to the 
vocalic pattern in Arabic. 
8 The first /u/ is a new vowel added to the response.  
9 These two responses could reflect the fact that these combinations of food are 
mostly eaten together. 
10 Constraint-based studies include but are not limited to: Bat-El and Cohen 
(2012); Arndt-Lappe and Plag (2012). 
11 These conclusions also agree with Adamâs (1973: 151) findings. 
12 Pronunciation of source words is added from the Oxford English Dictionary 
Online. 
13 Bertinetto (2001) analyses this blend as being formed in a sequential manner, 
although elsewhere in research on blending in English it is given as an example of 
sandwich blends, with source words chuckle and snort (Algeo 1977: 51). 
14 Although the examples used for each type of recombination are taken from 
Bertinetto (2001, 67-8), he clearly cited blunge as an example of recombination 
after the overlap; the other examples are selected by the present author as showing 
the other types of recombination. 
15 Annotation and abbreviation are here adjusted to match the conventions used in 
the present study. Bat-El and Cohen (2012) referred to the source words as base 
words and used the term âlefthand base wordâ (W1) and ârighthand base wordâ 
(W2) to refer to the first and second source words, respectively.

18 The Arabic word pattern that is represented by this skeletal/vocalic pattern is 
generally called IDÒ±ODO which is a derivational morpheme for most of the 
quadriliteral verbs and nouns in Arabic. 
19 The use of âandâ under the label SWs reflects coordinates; whereas the source 
words that are given without âand are either genitive constructions or taken from 
sentences. 
20 A variant spelling for this blend that is found in the literature is /dÝ¤aÝ§fal/, where 
there is metathesis. 
21 0Æmeaning âwhat, whichâ is a connective, non-inflected noun in Arabic. Due 
to the consistent use of this noun /ma:/ with the verb /Ýa:Ý¦/ âwillâ, the two terms 
have both been identified and used as one lexeme in this context; therefore, they 
contribute their root graphemes as if they were one unit.

fortressâ to properly refer to the place after which it has been named. 
23 This word pattern is represented in Arabic as /fiÝ§all/. 
24 Bi âinâ is a preposition. The preposition /bi/ and its object /Ý¦ism/ ânameâ are 
written and pronounced as one word when followed by the word $OOÆK. These two 
words are collocating, and they are used frequently in Arabic especially, when 
reading the Holy Quran. This prepositional phrase has been used as one lexeme in 
this context. When looked for in the ICA under the root search option, it appeared 
to have the root bsm. 
25 This word pattern is represented in Arabic as /fahfaÝ§il/.
