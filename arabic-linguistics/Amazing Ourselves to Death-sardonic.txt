**"Amazing Ourselves to the Sarcasm: A 'Brave' New Review"**

Oh joy, another book review has landed in our laps, promising to unravel the mysteries of Neil Postman’s legacy. This time it's Lance Strate’s take on “Amusing Ourselves to Death” – or should we say, "Amazing Ourselves to Death"? Because apparently, we need to re-interpret everything to fit into today’s media landscape, even when Postman himself stopped updating his magnum opus years ago.

Strate dives headfirst into the world of media ecology, a field that seems less about exploring new territories and more like an intellectual game of “Whack-a-Mole” with theoretical concepts. His approach: meticulously sticking to Postman’s original ideas like they’re sacred texts from Mount Olympus. Why innovate when you can just elaborate on what someone else already said?

The book begins by dissecting Postman's original thesis, asserting that the television-dominated media landscape had somehow turned our brains into mush, making us unable to tell serious matters from entertainment. Bravo! Who would have thought? The cornerstone of democratic culture is public discourse based on literate communication – and guess what, dear reader, we’ve forgotten how to do that because of some pesky TV shows.

Then there’s Strate’s homage to media ecology, which sounds like an eco-friendly spinoff of the tech industry but isn't. It’s all about understanding mediums as both technology and technique – a concept so mind-bendingly complex it makes quantum physics look like preschool math. Strate goes on to argue that these mediums permeate our environment, altering everything within it. So, yes, you can blame your inability to have deep conversations at dinner parties on the very air you breathe.

Moving on, social media gets a rap as the new-age heralds of public discourse – or not. Twitter and its ilk are celebrated for fostering interpersonal connections, even though they might as well be glorified gossip columns with character limits. Apparently, substantive dialogue is too much to ask from our digital overlords.

Then we have journalism, which apparently went on a holiday when television news arrived. Objectivity became passé, replaced by the drama of para-social relationships between reporters and their audience. Blogs and social news websites are hailed as democratic forces – except when they’re not, according to Strate's selective critique.

And let’s not forget education, with its grand thefts perpetrated by video shows like Sesame Street. Learning is now a hybrid of entertainment and information, making the classroom feel more like a theme park than a temple of knowledge.

In conclusion, Strate leaves us pondering how we can align new media with democratic needs – as if one person’s deep analysis could solve that conundrum! Maybe next time, we’ll have an author who isn’t afraid to offer original thoughts instead of just rehashing old ones. But until then, we’re left wondering: is this book review or a historical recount? Either way, it's a must-read for anyone who still believes in the power of print.

**"Back to Basics? Why This Review Might Just Make You Want to Unplug Forever!"**

Ah, yes, here we are once again, embarking on a thrilling journey into the labyrinthine world of education and media technology critique—courtesy of L. E. Mason's review of yet another academic paper by Strate that makes you wonder if the pen is mightier than the smartphone.

At its core, this review attempts to tackle the *existential* crisis in modern education—not due to a lack of information or outdated methodologies—but because, as Strate so insightfully puts it, "the problem of education is a human one." A bold statement indeed! In a world where everyone seems convinced they're on the verge of discovering the next educational super-app, Strate dares to suggest that maybe, just maybe, we should focus more on our humanity than our hardware.

Let's dive into the heartwarming embrace of Strate’s argument: online technologies are akin to digital scissors, ready to amputate learning possibilities with a single click. And in this dystopian vision, he warns us against falling for the siren song of technological advancement without considering the potential downsides—because who doesn't need another lecture on how tech can be bad?

But fear not! Strate is here with his panacea: balance! How revolutionary! In his grand finale, he assures us that while we cannot—and should not—return to a simpler time (cue the dramatic sighs), we must engage in "concerted evaluation" of our actions. Because nothing says 'progress' like tiptoeing around with caution flags.

And here comes the pièce de résistance: the call for reviving orality, print literacy, and all things analog—because who doesn't dream about spending their days hand-writing letters while humming Beethoven's Fifth? This is Strate’s recipe for a "fully human life," which apparently excludes any semblance of modern convenience.

Some readers might argue that Strate (influenced by Postman) exaggerates the perils of media technologies and downplays the benefits. But let's face it, who has time for nuance when you can be bombarded with clickbait titles about the "Dangers of Modern Technology" or "Is Tech Ruining Education?" 

For those brave enough to venture into this quagmire of critical assessment, Strate’s work is supposedly an essential read. Just don’t say we didn’t warn you—prepare for a nostalgic trip back to a time when "media literacy" was just the name of your third-grade reading program.

So, grab your paperbacks and dust off those record players—you're about to get schooled in what it means to be human in an increasingly digital world. Or maybe just enjoy this article as a brief respite from the relentless march of progress. Your choice!
