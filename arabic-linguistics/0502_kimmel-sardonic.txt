Ah yes, the venerable world of science fiction—so serious, so complex, and absolutely not just about spaceships or time travel! Prepare yourself for this enlightening review of Dan Kimmel's heartfelt plea to the masses: "Oh please, let us have our moment in the literary sun, thank you very much!"

Kimmel, who is quite clearly sporting a yellow jacket in his bonnet—or maybe it’s just that he’s been sitting too long on his throne as an advocate for science fiction—wants us all to believe that sci-fi is not only legitimate but essential. Who knew? Cue the eye rolls.

In 2011, Kimmel released *Jar Jar Binks Must Die... and Other Observations about Science Fiction Movies*, a title so delightfully clickbaity it’s enough to make your heart stop for a nanosecond. (But don’t worry, there are no killer robots involved.) The book was nominated for a Hugo Award, which is apparently the Oscars of science fiction—though clearly, even in this genre, Kimmel has his detractors.

Why must science fiction films be defended? Because, according to our dear Dan, every time someone dares to use futuristic gadgets or explores dystopian futures, critics and filmmakers alike declare it's really not about "real" science. It’s “really” just a thinly veiled metaphor for human relationships. How groundbreaking! It’s almost as if these films might actually feature more than one genre—shocking!

Take *Gattaca*, the film that makes you cry because it’s such a heavy-handed reminder that your DNA isn’t your destiny. Well, obviously. But who knew science fiction could evoke tears? Maybe we should reconsider our entire definition of what constitutes emotional storytelling.

Then there's *Metropolis*, which Kimmel champions as a sci-fi masterpiece despite its German expressionist roots and, well, the fact that it includes all the requisite elements of a dystopian narrative: mad scientists, killer robots, and oppressive futures. This film is apparently so thinly disguised in science fiction trappings that even German archivists can't see them! If only more films were this subtle.

And let's not forget *The Time Traveler’s Wife*, which Kimmel insists is science fiction but is “really” about romance—a classic example of genre bending if there ever was one. It’s almost like the film wants to have its cake and eat it too, except everyone keeps saying it doesn’t want cake at all.

So why are these dismissive appraisals a thing? Kimmel suggests that even in fandom, science fiction is often written off as something for children. Because nothing says “for adults only” quite like the thought of time travel or alien encounters! (Note to self: never trust anyone who doesn’t consider spaceships part of their morning routine.)

In conclusion, Dan Kimmel’s impassioned defense of science fiction serves as a delightful reminder that sometimes, what seems like niche entertainment is actually a complex reflection of our society. Or at the very least, it’s a place where robots and mad scientists reign supreme—something adults can appreciate alongside their favorite rom-coms.

**"Binge-Watch This List of Must-See Sci-Fi Films—if You Enjoy Watching Time Warp and Mind Warp in One Swoop!"**

Ah, yes. Let's dive into the thrilling world where 90% is supposedly "crud," yet we're promised a list that will redefine our understanding of space, time, and sanity—or at least try to.

First off, let’s marvel at the genius insight provided by science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (because when in doubt, quote the experts on how half the things you love are garbage). According to him, everything's crud. So, why bother with anything at all? Good question! Perhaps that's what this genre is trying to answer as it gives us coded messages about real life—like talking communism through alien pod people. Who knew "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" was a metaphorical deep dive into Hollywood’s blacklist?

Now, let's talk about our author who just completed a novel entitled *Shh! It’s a Secret: A Novel about Aliens, Hollywood, and the Bartender’s Guide*. Oh wait, that sounds like my last Saturday night—except replace "bartenders" with intergalactic diplomats. How original, how riveting! Who knew the son of an alien ambassador would come to Hollywood wanting to be in movies? Because nothing screams “top secret movie project” quite like a film about aliens mingling with Tinseltown execs.

Enter Kimmel’s “baker's dozen” of sci-fi films. Now, I love a good baker’s dozen almost as much as I love soggy bottoms on my scones, but why stop at 13 when you can add "The Fly" twice? Once in 1958 and then again in 1986 because—surprise!—the remake is better, right?

Metropolis (1927) is here. You know, that silent film where they made the robots look more expressive than your average emoji user. Bride of Frankenstein (1935), because there's nothing like a little horror to spice up science fiction.

And let’s not forget Gattaca (1997). Oh wait, we haven’t even discussed the 25th-century genetic engineering yet! Because clearly, discussing DNA is as mainstream as alien ambassadors in Hollywood. 

In all seriousness, it's hard not to feel entertained by such enthusiasm for a genre often dismissed as frivolous fluff. So while some might dismiss science fiction as part of that dreaded 90% crud, it seems someone was having fun with those very same conventions—whether through film or writing.

So here’s your takeaway: Whether you’re gazing into the starry abyss of "2001: A Space Odyssey" or pondering why pod people are more politically palatable than pinkos, science fiction offers a delightful escape. It might not solve life's mysteries, but it sure makes for an entertaining trip through them—critics be damned!
