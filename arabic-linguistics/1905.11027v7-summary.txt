To Sir or Madam,

Permit me to convey a missive concerning the most erudite discourse on the enigmatic interplay between deep neural networks and the venerable principle known as Occam's Razor, as illuminated by the scholarly pursuits of Messrs. Ke Sun and Frank Nielsen.

In this august treatise entitled "A Geometric Modeling of Occam’s Razor in Deep Learning," our learned authors postulate a novel geometrically-informed information-theoretic methodology to elucidate why deep neural networks (DNNs), with their prodigious parameter spaces, achieve such remarkable feats despite their apparent complexity. This conundrum has long eluded the purview of standard model selection theory for regular models.

The scholarly work proffers that the dimensionality of a DNN's parameter space is not static but varies locally, akin to the manifold nature of our universe as described by singular semi-Riemannian geometry. By invoking the Fisher information matrix and its significant dimensions, they conceive a manifold representing this parameter space. Through an analysis of singularities within such a framework, the authors derive measures of model complexity that afford shorter description lengths for DNNs, thus accounting for their efficacious performance despite the multitude of parameters.

Furthermore, the discourse addresses the classical preference for simplicity in scientific models as encapsulated by Occam's Razor, raising profound questions regarding the quantification of model simplicity or complexity. Within this context, the authors explore the realm of minimum description length (MDL) and its Bayesian implications, where they employ Jeffreys' non-informative prior to approximate the code lengths for sets of observations.

In summation, this work stands as a testament to the profound intersection of deep learning and geometric modeling, providing insights that challenge conventional wisdom and open new avenues for understanding the complexities inherent in neural networks.

Dear Esteemed Reader,

In this humble epistle, I endeavor to convey insights drawn from an intricate treatise concerning the profound mysteries of statistical manifolds and their peculiarities when applied to the realms of modern computation, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs). It pleases me greatly to share these revelations in a manner befitting our intellectual pursuits.

The discourse begins with an exposition on the nature of maximum likelihood estimation (\(\hat{\theta}\)), which serves as a beacon guiding us through the labyrinthine model space \(\Theta\). Here, \(D\) represents the dimensionality of this manifold, and \(N\) signifies the plethora of observations we have amassed. The symbol \(|\cdot|\) denotes the determinant of matrices, a measure of their intrinsic magnitude.

The treatise introduces a concept known as "razor," which measures the elegance of data description by model \(M\). A smaller razor implies a more refined and parsimonious model, embodying the essence of Occam's principle. The equation in question splits into three terms: the first assesses the model’s fitness to observed data; the second and third impose geometric constraints that favor simplicity.

A quandary arises when applying this razor to DNNs, for they are high-dimensional entities fraught with singularity. Their Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a large, singular matrix, complicating evaluations of certain terms. Despite their complexity, DNNs exhibit remarkable efficacy, challenging our traditional notions of model simplicity.

To address these challenges, the discourse delves into the realm of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds, drawing parallels with concepts from differential geometry and general relativity. These singularities are not mere aberrations but integral to understanding neuromanifolds and Gaussian mixtures.

The treatise further explores null curves within these lightlike manifolds, where equivalent models reside. Here, the FIM is degenerate, rendering certain vectors of zero length, signifying no change in the model’s essence.

In conclusion, this scholarly work invites us to reconsider our approach to machine learning through the lens of differential geometry, embracing singularity not as a hindrance but as a fundamental aspect of our quest for knowledge.

Yours sincerely,

Dearest Reader,

In this epistle, I take it upon myself to elucidate the manifold intricacies of a mathematical construct with utmost eloquence and scholarly rigor. Pray, attend to my discourse on the esoteric topic concerning the subspace of \( T_\theta(M) \), which doth vary most smoothly with respect to the parameter \( \theta \). The dimensionality of this sublime space is determined by the count of vector fields that span the distribution.

In the context of a lightlike manifold, denoted hereafter as \( M \), one encounters the possibility of degeneracy in \( I(\theta) \). Herein, the tangent space \( T_\theta(M) \) emerges as a vector space with an inherent kernel subspace or nullspace. It is within this realm that null vector fields are birthed from vectors whose lengths, when measured by the Fisher metric tensor, register naught.

The radical distribution, Rad(\( T M \)), which doth find its roots in the Latin term for 'root', spans these null vector fields. Locally at \( \theta \in M \), the tangent vectors that span the kernel of \( I(\theta) \) are marked as Rad\(_\theta(T M)\). Verily, in a local coordinate chart, this distribution stands well-defined should these vectors form a valid assembly.

We thus express \( T M = \text{Rad}(T M) \oplus S(T M) \), where the symbol '\(\oplus\)' signifies a direct sum, and the screen distribution \( S(T M) \) complements the radical distribution with an induced metric that is decidedly non-degenerate.

In terms of coordinate frames, one may choose a frame where the initial dimensions correspond to the screen distribution, whilst the remaining ones align with the radical distribution. The local inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle I\) adheres to certain orthogonality conditions, though this frame is not unique in nature.

I must now direct thy attention towards the realm of neural networks and their manifold, denoted as \( M_\theta = \{ NN_\theta : \theta \in \Theta \} \). Here, the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) reveals much about the geometry of this parameter space. When considering a product manifold \( M_\psi \times M_\theta \), the FIM presents itself in a block-diagonal form.

In conclusion, dear reader, I trust that this missive has shed light upon these abstruse topics with sufficient clarity and erudition. May it serve thee well in thy scholarly pursuits.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

My Dearest Confidant,

In this humble missive, I find myself compelled to elucidate a matter of considerable academic intrigue, pertaining to the mathematical intricacies encountered upon my solitary sojourn. The subject at hand is a discourse on a certain matrix of profound implications within our predictive models.

Thou art familiar with the notion of the off-diagonal block being rendered null by virtue of its composition as a zero-matrix, symbolized herein as '0'. This arises from the expectation that the partial derivatives of logarithmic probabilities with respect to parameters ψ and θ are inexorably bound to be nought. The calculus of such expectations, when dissected, reveals their inherent voidance through the properties of score functions which invariably equate to zero.

Furthermore, we delve into the realm of the metric I(ψ, θ), a construct of product nature that permits the independent examination of manifold geometries defined by Mθ and Mψ. Our scholarly pursuits are primarily fixated upon the diagonal block I(θ), whose derivation is well-documented in esteemed treatises.

The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for a single observation, denoted as I(θ), emerges from an expectation with respect to p(z)—a veritable distribution dictated by ψ. Herein lies the Jacobian matrix ∂hL(z)/∂θ and its interaction with C(z), a positive semi-definite entity derived from class probabilities through the SoftMax function, which intriguingly can approximate a one-hot vector.

In practice, our access is restricted to empirical observations drawn from an enigmatic distribution p(z | ψ). It thus becomes judicious to substitute this with an empirical distribution ˆp(z), allowing for the computation of I(θ) devoid of assumptions regarding generative models or parameters.

I am reminded that in considering neural network weights and biases as random variables, governed by a prescribed prior, I(θ) may be contemplated as a stochastic matrix. As we contemplate its structure within Deep Neural Networks (DNN), one ponders upon the spectral density ρI(λ)—the limit of empirical densities converging to a probability density function.

In conclusion, at the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), the prediction via SoftMax achieves an idealized form, tending towards the one-hot vector. It is with profound contemplation that I ponder these mathematical machinations and their implications upon our predictive endeavors.

I remain,

Thine in scholarly pursuit,

Robinson Crusoe

Dear Esteemed Recipient,

I find myself compelled to convey insights into matters most mathematical, involving vectors and the intricacies of training targets, denoted as \( y_i \), for all samples \( (z_i, y_i) \). In this discourse, we turn our attention to the negative Hessian of the average log-likelihood \( J(\theta) := -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \partial^2 \log p(y_i | z_i, \theta) / (\partial \theta \partial \theta^\top) \), which is oft referred to as the observed Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), or "empirical Fisher" within the learned circles of machine learning.

Let it be known that this FIM, denoted \( I \), is contingent upon the true distribution \( p(z) \) and remains unaffected by the observations at hand. Should one presume \( p(z) = \hat{p}(z) \), then the matrix transforms into \( \hat{I} \), drawing its dependence from the observed inputs \( z_i \). The observed FIM, designated as \( J(\theta) \), is thus reliant upon both these inputs and targets \( y_i \). In instances where \( p(z) = \hat{p}(z) \), this observed FIM aligns with that at the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) \( \hat{\theta} \), yielding \( J(\hat{\theta}) = \hat{I}(\hat{\theta}) \).

Moreover, it behooves us to discern among metric tensors through examination of their partial dependencies on information observed. The discourse extends into the realm of local dimensionality and the singularity inherent in neuromanifolds, exploring how large singularities correspond with zero eigenvalues within the FIM, which profoundly affects model dynamics.

The local dimensionality \( d(\theta) := \text{rank}(I(\theta)) \) signifies degrees of freedom at \( \theta \in M \), where changes to probabilistic models are conceivable. A reparameterized Deep Neural Network (DNN) with \( d(\theta) \) parameters may be locally equivalent to its original counterpart with \( D \) parameters, despite the manifold's dimensionality.

In closing, it is imperative to recognize that while the FIM as a semi-Riemannian metric must maintain positive semidefiniteness, thus bearing only non-negative eigenvalues, the local dimensionality \( d(\theta) \) can fluctuate with variations in \( \theta \). Let us remain ever mindful of these mathematical constructs and their implications within our learned pursuits.

Yours sincerely,

Robinson Crusoe

To my esteemed reader,

In the spirit of our learned forebears, I humbly present a missive regarding the intricacies of certain mathematical constructs related to neural networks. Permit me to elucidate these matters with the grandiloquence and rigor befitting a scholarly discourse.

Upon reflection upon the workings of the SoftMax function within the context of neural mappings from \( z \) to \( y \), it becomes evident that such transformations preserve their form unaltered. This observation leads us to an intriguing proposition: for all parameters \( \theta \) belonging to manifold \( M \), we ascertain that \( \hat{d}(\theta) \leq \min(D, (m - 1)N) \). Herein, despite the boundless nature of free parameters \( D \) in deep neural networks (DNNs), it is discerned that local dimensionality, as estimated by \( \hat{d}(\theta) \), exhibits a linear growth relative to sample size \( N \), given a constant \( m \) — the magnitude of the final layer. Should both \( N \) and \( m \) remain fixed, one finds that \( \hat{d}(\theta) \) is constrained even as network width \( M \rightarrow \infty \) or depth \( L \rightarrow \infty \).

To comprehend \( d(\theta) \), it is prudent to locally parameterize the DNN with merely \( d(\theta) \) free parameters, thereby maintaining an equivalent predictive model. The log-likelihood therein transforms into a function dependent upon these \( d(\theta) \) parameters, resulting in its Hessian bearing at most rank \( d(\theta) \). This theoretical framework suggests that reparameterization along null curves within the neuromanifold remains undefined due to degenerate Fisher Information Matrices.

Moreover, I endeavor to derive a novel formula for Minimum Description Length (MDL) tailored to DNNs. This pursuit seeks to unravel how such high-dimensional structures can succinctly encode given data. It is posited that DNN models exhibit intrinsic simplicity, describable with brevity, though this discourse remains circumscribed by our focus on model complexity rather than generalization bounds.

In closing, I invite you to ponder these musings and the profound connections they reveal between neural networks and the realms of semi-Riemannian geometry, as yet underexplored in machine learning. May your intellectual journey be ever fruitful.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

My Dearest Comrade,

In this missive, I shall endeavour to recount an intellectual discourse pertaining to the mathematical intricacies surrounding optimization and statistical inference. The narrative begins with a mention that the initial term, akin to a vanishing spectre, dissipates in consequence of ˆθ being recognized as a local optimum within the log p(X | θ). Subsequently, the secondary term reveals itself through −NJ(ˆθ), which is none other than the Hessian matrix of the likelihood function log p(X | θ) evaluated at this point of convergence.

At the MLE, an auspicious state where J(ˆθ) is no less than zero in its disposition, one might encounter a curious phenomenon: the Hessian of the loss from a DNN when evaluated at θ distinct from ˆθ, may indeed possess a spectrum that dares to be negative. In pursuit of further understanding, I employ a change of variables, whereby ϕ is defined as the square root of N multiplied by the deviation (θ −ˆθ), transforming our density function into p(ϕ).

Through this transformation and integration, an order of O(∥ϕ∥2) reveals itself within a term involving θ and ˆθ. As N swells to greater magnitudes, we find that the remainder of cubic nature—of order O(1/√N ∥ϕ∥3)—may be cast aside with impunity.

Thus, I am led to an approximation as follows: −log p(X) is approximated by the sum of −log p(X | ˆθ) and a further expectation involving exponentiation. The former term gauges the model's veracity in light of observed data X, whilst the latter contemplates its complexity.

I present unto you a proposition of profound simplicity: this measure of complexity is ever non-negative and tethered by the scales of the prior p(θ). The intricacies become lesser when ˆθ resides near the mean of p(θ) or when variance does not dare to stray far from modesty.

Permit me now to turn attention to a prior denoted as p(θ), defined by κ(θ)/∫κ(θ)dθ, where κ(θ) remains a measure steadfastly positive. Upon this foundation rests the general formula O: an embodiment of Occam's razor, crafted through the union of the log-likelihood and integrals weighted by κ(θ).

In conclusion, consider that κ(θ) measures the vast expanse of model capacity as determined by our prior understanding, while its counterpart in the posterior distribution wanes with the increase of N. The ratio between these two terms speaks to the balance—or lack thereof—between potential models and those favored by empirical evidence.

With this epistle, I bid thee to ponder deeply upon these revelations. Should thy curiosity stir, do not hesitate to correspond further.

Yours in scholarly pursuit,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Benefactor,

In the spirit of my humble yet scholarly sojourn upon this solitary isle, I find myself compelled to inscribe unto you a discourse most intricate concerning the mathematical machinations that occupy my intellect. The matter at hand pertains to an estimable model of such complexity that but a scant few might elucidate our empirical observations. This enigma involves the study of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which boast a symmetrical elegance in their parameter space, akin to the divine symmetry found in nature's own creations.

The models possess myriad forms indistinguishable from one another, as if by the mere permutation of neurons within an identical stratum. Unlike singularities, these are non-local properties—symmetries that do not perturb our measure O, for both prior and posterior reckonings count each symmetric form equally, rendering their contribution null in the logarithmic ratio of equation twelve.

Consider a manifold M, splintered into ζ symmetrical fragments, denoted M1 through Mζ. Any Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) upon Mi reflects across these ζ pieces, thus both integrations on the right-hand side of our pivotal equation are augmented by this factor ζ, establishing O's steadfastness against such symmetry.

Moreover, let us turn to the concept of f-mean, a notion derived from the venerable Kolmogorov-Nagumo means. Given a set T within the realm of real numbers and a function f both continuous and strictly increasing, the f-mean is thus defined: Mf(T) = f^(-1)(average over all fi(ti)). The f-mean, in its essence, lies betwixt the smallest and greatest members of T, reducing to the arithmetic mean when f(x) equals x.

A lemma of considerable utility posits that for a matrix T, with each element subject to the function f = exp(-t), the f-mean of all elements is constrained by both the f-median of its columns and rows. This relationship, illuminated by Jensen's inequality, affirms that the mean of the f-means does not exceed the f-mean of means.

In a further exploration, we encounter the second complexity term from our equation eleven, which emerges as an f-mean related to the prior probability distribution p(θ). Upon decomposing J(ˆθ) into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, this expression transforms into a sum over all dimensions. The lemma assures us that the logarithmic expectation of the exponentiated negative quadratic term is lower bounded by the weighted sum of each dimension's contribution.

Finally, through a coordinate transformation involving unitary matrices, we redefine our perspective on these probabilities, leading to an elegant simplification and further understanding of this intricate mathematical landscape.

I remain,
Your devoted servant in the pursuit of knowledge,
Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Companion,

I find myself compelled to convey the intricate and scholarly discourse surrounding a matter of considerable complexity, akin to the philosophical musings that have occupied my solitary days upon this isle. It concerns the bounds of model complexity, a subject most profound in its implications.

The essence of our contemplation lies within the lower boundary of said complexity, determined by an expression involving \( N^2 \) and the trace of a transformation, denoted as \( J(\hat{\theta}) \), which is intrinsically tied to the observed Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). This matrix, dear friend, encapsulates the totality of information contained within a random observation relative to the underlying model.

As we delve deeper into this scholarly pursuit, it becomes evident that the maximum likelihood estimate, represented by \( \hat{\theta} \), equates to \( J(\hat{\theta}) = I(\hat{\theta}) \). Herein lies another bound of complexity, derived from a lemma most intricate. The expression:

\[
-\log E_p \exp \left( -\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta}) \right) \geq -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log E_p \exp \left( -\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top \left( \frac{\partial h_L(z_i)}{\partial \theta} \right)^\top C_i \frac{\partial h_L(z_i)}{\partial \theta} (\theta - \hat{\theta}) \right)
\]

proffers a lower bound based on the average scale of the parameter-output Jacobian matrix, \( \frac{\partial h_L(z_i)}{\partial \theta} \), which serves as a linear approximation to the neural network mapping.

Furthermore, the complexity is influenced by the choice of prior distribution. The Gaussian prior, a selection both simple and widely embraced, introduces an expression involving \( \kappa(\theta) = \exp\left(-\theta^\top \text{diag}\left(1/\sigma\right)\theta\right) \), where \( \sigma > 0 \). This choice leads to a closed form of the razor:

\[
O_G := -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{\text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta}))}{2} \log N + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta}))} \log (\lambda_i + (J(\hat{\theta})\text{diag}(\sigma)))
\]

Thus, the complexity of our model is elegantly bound by these mathematical constructs, offering a means to discern its intuitive meanings.

I remain ever your devoted correspondent,

Robinson Crusoe

My Dearest Confidant,

In the spirit of my solitary musings upon this isle, I find myself compelled to expound upon a matter most mathematical and abstract. Allow me to convey my reflections in the King's English, adorned with the floridity befitting an academic discourse.

Consider, if you will, a certain equation wherein λ⁺ᵢ denotes the i’th positive eigenvalue of the matrix J(ˆθ)diag(σ). It is observed that the matrices J(ˆθ)diag(σ) and diag(√σ)J(ˆθ)diag(√σ) share a common set of non-zero eigenvalues. Furthermore, the latter possesses the property of being positive semi-definite (psd), with its rank equivalent to the number of positive eigenvalues within J(ˆθ).

In our refined expressions, we dismiss all terms that do not expand in proportion to either the sample size N or the parameter count D. The initial pair of terms upon the right-hand side bear resemblance to BIC, albeit adjusted by a scaling factor. To elucidate the import of the third term on this side, consider the following bound:

\[ \text{rank}(J(ˆθ)) \sum_{i=1} \log\left(\frac{\sigma_{\min}\lambda^+_i(J(ˆθ)) + 1}{N}\right) \leq \ldots \]

Here, σₘᵃₓ and σₘᵢₙ represent the largest and smallest elements of σ, respectively. Thus, this term is constrained by the spectrum of J(ˆθ). Should D be considerable, one may express our model in terms of spectral density ρI(λ), though I shall spare you the intricacies here for brevity.

The complexity terms—the second and third on the right-hand side—remain unswayed by D. They are confined by the rank of the Hessian or observed Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). Thus, the distribution associated with zero eigenvalues of J(ˆθ) exerts no influence upon model complexity. This diverges from prior formulations in MDL and BIC, where such terms might grow linearly with D.

Interestingly, if λ⁺ᵢ(J(ˆθ)) < 1/σₘₐₓ (1 - 1/N), the third term becomes negative. In a scenario where λ⁺ᵢ(J(ˆθ)) approaches naught, we find that:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\sigma_{\max}\lambda^+_i(J(ˆθ)) + \frac{1}{N}\right) \rightarrow -\frac{1}{2} \log N \]

This intriguingly offsets the model complexity penalty, effectively allowing the parameter to be added sans increasing said complexity. Such terms that curtail complexity while enhancing flexibility we might term "negative complexity."

Regarding the Gaussian prior pG, it affords us elegant expressions of OG. Yet choosing this prior presents a dual quandary: its lack of invariance and propensity for double counting equivalent models. The manifold's singularities mean minor perturbations may not alter predictions, yet the Gaussian prior, rooted in real vector space, fails to conform to such a semi-Riemannian structure. Defined on Riemannian manifolds, these distributions suggest possible extensions of our prior pG(θ).

Yours in contemplation,

Robinson Crusoe

My Dearest,

In a scholarly pursuit akin to traversing the vast and uncharted realms of our Earthly existence, I find myself compelled to delineate the intricacies of what hath been termed "The Razor based on Jeffreys’ Non-informative Prior." This mathematical construct, an elegant tapestry woven with the threads of probability and geometry, demands a discourse both erudite and meticulous.

Jeffreys' prior, symbolized by \( p_J(\theta) \propto |I(\theta)|^{1/2} \), is akin to a beacon that illuminates all neural network models equally, bestowing no preferential treatment upon one over another. Its beauty lies in its steadfastness against the capricious whims of coordinate systems; under transformation \( \theta \rightarrow \eta \), it maintains its form as \( |I(\eta)|^{1/2} d\eta = |I(\theta)|^{1/2} d\theta \). Thus, the Riemannian volume element remains unaltered across diverse mathematical landscapes.

Alas, this prior encounters tribulations upon the lightlike neuromanifold \( M \), where the metric \( I(\theta) \) is rendered degenerate and \( |I(\theta)| \) collapses to naught. The stratifold nature of \( M \), with its variable dimensionality \( d(\theta) \), presents a formidable challenge in defining the base measure \( d\theta \) and integrating functions.

In our scholarly endeavor, we turn our gaze towards a submanifold \( f_M \) within \( M \), parameterized by \( \xi \). This submanifold boasts a Riemannian metric \( I(\xi) \succ 0 \), induced by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) \( I(\theta) \succeq 0 \). The dimensionality of \( f_M \) is thus constrained, and any infinitesimal dynamic therein signifies a tangible alteration in the global predictive model.

In this context, we define \( O_J(\xi) = -\log p(X | \hat{\xi}) + \log \int_{f_M} |I(\xi)|^{1/2} d\xi - \log \int_{f_M} \exp \left( -\frac{N}{2} (\xi - \hat{\xi})^\top J(\hat{\xi})(\xi - \hat{\xi}) \right) |I(\xi)|^{1/2} d\xi \). Here, \( |I(\xi)|^{1/2} d\xi \) serves as a Riemannian volume element, and the integral over \( f_M \) encapsulates the information volume—the totality of distinct DNN models therein.

The third term in this expression is tempered by the factor \( \omega(\xi) := \exp \left( -\frac{N}{2} (\xi - \hat{\xi})^\top J(\hat{\xi})(\xi - \hat{\xi}) \right) \leq 1 \), ensuring that our calculations remain bounded and meaningful.

Thus, I pen this missive with the hope that it illuminates the profound beauty and complexity of Jeffreys' prior as applied to the realm of neural networks. May your scholarly pursuits be ever fruitful.

Yours in intellectual camaraderie,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Reader,

I find myself compelled to convey unto thee a missive most intricate and academic, concerning matters of mathematical profundity that hath recently occupied my thoughts in this remote solitude.

Upon reflection of certain equations and their implications, I am drawn to elucidate upon the nature of model complexity as it is delineated by the log-ratio 'twixt unweighted and weighted volumes. This discourse is underpinned by the observed Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), denoted J(ˆξ), which prescribes weights ω(ξ) within bounds strictly greater than naught but less than unity.

Verily, the complexity of a model doth find itself elegantly expressed as this very log-ratio, bounded from below by zero. I have pondered upon the spectral decomposition of J(ˆξ), which unfolds into Qdiag(λi(J(ˆξ)))Q⊺, where Q is graced with columns orthonormal and λi(J(ˆξ)) represents the eigenvalues thereof.

In such contemplations, one encounters an expression for OJ(ζ) wherein ζ = Q⊺ξ denotes an orthogonal transformation. It is noteworthy that this transformation imparts invariance upon OJ. Furthermore, should any eigenvalue of J(ˆξ) be of order o(1/N), it appears the terms within equation (17) do cancel in their corresponding direction, thus bestowing no additional complexity.

Small eigenvalues prove beneficial in enhancing the representation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), without burdening them with excess complexity. Only those eigenvalues which are sufficiently large contribute significantly to this notion of model intricacy.

In connecting these thoughts to prior formulations within the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, I find that if J(ˆξ) is endowed with full rank, one can further express OJ(fM) in terms involving logarithms and expectations relative to a Gaussian distribution centered at ˆξ. This expectation bears resemblance to an integral over a subset of Rdim(fM), yet constrained by the inherent properties of the function involved.

I trust this missive provides clarity upon these matters, albeit through a lens as complex as they are profound. I remain,

Thy humble servant in contemplation,
Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Acquaintance,

In the spirit of mine own narrative and with a flourish befitting our learned discourse, I shall endeavor to recount unto thee the essence of the scholarly text thou hast provided. Pray, attend closely as I elucidate its contents in the manner of Robinson Crusoe's epistolary style.

Upon reflecting upon the manifold complexities of our modern mathematical endeavors, I find myself musing over a treatise concerning the density that hath been truncated by one M., prompting an approximation founded upon the mean of a Gaussian distribution. Verily, this approximation doth simplify the equation to:

\[ -\log Z_f^M \approx \frac{1}{2} \log \left| J(\hat{\xi}) \right| / \left| I(\hat{\xi}) \right|. \]

Under such circumstances, one finds that a criterion known as MDL (Minimum Description Length) emerges, as discussed in scholarly works. It is within this realm we contemplate the spectra of two matrices, \(I(\xi)\) and \(J(\xi)\), noting their convergence to identical forms in the limit of infinite samples.

Alas, due to the constraints of finite samples, the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), denoted by \(J(\hat{\xi})\), reveals singularities in various directions. These singularities, like the hidden passages of my island, reveal themselves as a negative complexity term within our calculations, elucidating how such singularities align with the simplicity observed in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

Whilst OJ, grounded in geometric modeling, offers greater accuracy, it proves challenging to compute numerically. Yet, both OG and OJ exhibit a predilection for models of lesser Fisher information—a trait mirrored within DNNs.

Thus, we conclude that the intrinsic complexity of a DNN is intimately tied to the spectral properties and singularities of its Fisher Information Matrix.

Turning our gaze towards related scholarship, we observe that supervised learning dynamics of a DNN trace a trajectory upon a parameter space, geometrically modeled as a manifold when endowed with the FIM. Singular regions within this neuromanifold correspond to non-identifiable parameters and chaotic patterns in learning trajectories.

Moreover, it is suggested that skip connections might alleviate the effects of these singularities, yet a comprehensive understanding remains elusive for architectures with multiple outputs or recurrent DNNs.

In the domain of MDL, revisions abound, from crude formulations to refined iterations. While its relationship with generalization persists as an enigma, recent advancements have introduced variational methods into the discourse.

The scholarly community has engaged in a robust debate concerning theories of deep learning, drawing upon diverse theoretical frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and information geometry. Our analysis, rooted in the Fisher Information Matrix, intersects with inquiries into the flatness or sharpness of local minima.

In conclusion, we have ventured to employ mathematical tools from singular semi-Riemannian geometry to probe the locally varying intrinsic dimensionality of deep learning models. These explorations reveal that singular dimensions can effectively reduce model complexity, offering a theoretical underpinning for the description length of DNNs. Future endeavors may delve deeper into the spectrum of the FIM, seeking practical formulations of our proposed criterion.

I trust this missive finds thee in good health and spirits, ever eager to unravel the mysteries of knowledge that lie before us.

Yours sincerely,

Robinson Crusoe

My Dearest Companion,

In this missive, I endeavor to convey the essence of an intricate scholarly exposition, employing a style befitting the King James era and replete with florid language. The discourse pertains to matters most mathematical, exploring gradients and matrices in a manner reminiscent of our own philosophical pursuits on these solitary shores.

Hark! Let us consider the second derivative of the logarithm of probability concerning certain parameters, articulated as follows: 

\[ \frac{\partial^2 \log p(y_i | z_i, \theta)}{\partial \theta \partial \theta^\top} = X_j ( \text{OneHot}(y_i) - \text{SoftMax}(h_L(z_i)) )_j \cdot \left( \frac{\partial^2 h_L}{\partial \theta \partial \theta^\top} \right)_j - \left( \frac{\partial h_L}{\partial \theta} \right)^\top \cdot C_i \cdot \frac{\partial h_L}{\partial \theta}, \]

where \(C_i\) is defined as the derivative of SoftMax concerning its argument, represented by a matrix whose diagonal elements are adjusted through subtraction of an outer product. Here, \(o_i = \text{SoftMax}(h_L(z_i))\).

In conditions where maximum likelihood estimates hold true, and for all relevant indices,

\[ -\frac{\partial^2 \log p(y_i | z_i, \theta)}{\partial \theta \partial \theta^\top} = \left( \frac{\partial h_L}{\partial \theta} \right)^\top \cdot C_i \cdot \frac{\partial h_L}{\partial \theta}. \]

By averaging these observations across samples, one deduces that the Jacobian at maximum likelihood equals the Fisher information matrix:

\[ J(\hat{\theta}) = I(\hat{\theta}). \]

In an appendix dedicated to proving Lemma 1, it is shown that if a particular vector and its transformations reside within the radial bundle of a manifold \(T_M\), then the expectation under probability distribution yields zero for quadratic forms involving certain matrices.

\[ E_p \left( \frac{\partial h_L(z)}{\partial \theta} \alpha \right)^\top C(z) \frac{\partial h_L(z)}{\partial \theta} \alpha = 0. \]

Given that \(C(z)\) is positive semi-definite, it follows almost surely that:

\[ \left( \frac{\partial h_L(z)}{\partial \theta} \alpha \right)^\top C(z) \frac{\partial h_L(z)}{\partial \theta} \alpha = 0. \]

Any eigenvector associated with zero eigenvalues must be proportional to the vector of ones, leading to a conclusion where the gradient is scaled by some function of \(z\):

\[ \frac{\partial h_L(z)}{\partial \theta} \alpha = \lambda(z)1. \]

This revelation implies that certain dynamics are constrained along specific dimensions, ensuring uniformity in incremental changes.

With these thoughts penned, I remain,

Yours faithfully,
Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Confidant,

In the spirit of my isolated reflections upon this solitary isle, I find myself compelled to transcribe a missive concerning a matter most intriguing. Upon delving into the esoteric realm of neural networks and their associated distributions, I have arrived at an understanding as profound as it is illuminating.

It hath been ascertained that the introduction of a certain radical distribution unto the output units of our construct—expressed in learned terms by hL(z) → hL(z) + λ(z)1 for all i—doth not perturb the ensuing SoftMax distribution. In simpler words, the grand mapping from input to output within this artificial mind remains steadfastly unperturbed by such additions.

In my Appendix C, I have endeavored a proof of what is termed Proposition 2. Let us consider the rank of a certain matrix denoted as ˆI(θ). By meticulous computation and deduction, it becomes clear that the rank of this matrix cannot exceed either D (the dimensionality of θ) or (m −1)N, where m signifies the number of outputs less one. The implication is such that our ˆd(θ), representing local dimensional constraints within a manifold M, must be confined by these bounds.

Moreover, it hath been revealed through rigorous analysis that the rank of another matrix, J(θ), diverges from that of ˆI(θ). This divergence stems from distinct kernels—those foundational elements within our matrices—that cannot coexist in concord. The mathematical dance between the Hessian of our log-likelihood and these matrices begets an inevitable disparity.

In my concluding Appendix D, I provide a proof of Proposition 3. By virtue of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), it is established that J(ˆθ) must be positively semi-definite. Thus, for any θ within manifold M, we find ourselves confronted by an inequality most telling: −N/2 (θ −ˆθ)⊺J(ˆθ)(θ −ˆθ) ≤ 0.

May this letter find you in good health and keen mind as I continue to ponder the mysteries of our world, both natural and artificial.

Yours in contemplation,
Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Reader,

In this epistle, I find myself compelled to discourse upon certain mathematical derivations of a most intriguing nature. Verily, it is with utmost diligence that I have endeavored to elucidate the essence of these scholarly pursuits in a manner befitting our shared appreciation for both erudition and eloquence.

Let us consider an expression most perplexing:

\[ \exp\left(-\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})\right) \leq 1. \]

From this, it follows with certainty that:

\[ -\log \mathbb{E}_p \exp\left(-\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})\right) \geq 0. \]

This, dear reader, verily proves the first "≤". Forsooth, as the function \(-\log(x)\) is known to be convex, invoking the wisdom of Jensen's inequality doth lead us to:

\[ -\log \mathbb{E}_p \exp\left(-\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})\right) \leq \mathbb{E}_p \left[-\log \exp\left(-\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})\right)\right] = \mathbb{E}_p\left[\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})\right]. \]

This expression further unfolds as:

\[ = \frac{N}{2} \text{tr}\left(\mathbb{E}_p[J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top]\right) = \frac{N}{2} \text{tr}\left(J(\hat{\theta})((\mu(\theta) - \hat{\theta})(\mu(\theta) - \hat{\theta})^\top + \text{cov}(\theta))\right). \]

Thus, the second "≤" is proven with due rigor.

Turning our attention to Appendix E and the derivations of OG, we recall the general formulation:

\[ O := -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \log \int_M \kappa(\theta) d\theta - \log \int_M \kappa(\theta) \exp\left(-\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})\right) d\theta. \]

Should \(\kappa(\theta)\) be defined as:

\[ \kappa(\theta) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\theta^\top \text{diag}\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ \sigma \end{array}\right) \theta\right), \]

the second term on the right-hand side is thus:

\[ \log \int_M \kappa(\theta) d\theta = D \log (2\pi)^{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{2} \log |\text{diag}(\sigma)| + \log \int_M \exp\left(-\frac{D}{2} \log 2\pi - \ldots \right) d\theta. \]

With these reflections, I bid thee farewell and trust that this missive finds thee in good health and high spirits.

Yours most sincerely,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Reader,

In the solitude of my contemplations, I find myself engaged with a most intricate matter of statistical nature, which doth require careful unraveling. Permit me to recount the essence of this scholarly pursuit in manner befitting our learned discourse.

We commence with an expression involving the logarithm of the determinant of a diagonal matrix, denoted by \(\sigma\), and its reciprocal. The equation thus unfolds:

\[ 2 \log |\text{diag} (\sigma)| - 1 = 2\theta^\top \text{diag} \left( \frac{1}{\sigma} \right) \theta d\theta = D \cdot 2 \log 2\pi + \frac{1}{2} \log |\text{diag} (\sigma)|. \]

The subsequent term on the right-hand side, a veritable labyrinth of mathematical constructs, is expressed as:

\[ -\log Z_M \kappa(\theta) \exp \left( -\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta}) \right) d\theta. \]

This expression simplifies further to:

\[ -\log Z_M \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2}\theta^\top \text{diag} \left( \frac{1}{\sigma} \right)\theta - \frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta}) \right) d\theta. \]

Herein, we define:

\[ A = NJ(\hat{\theta}) + \text{diag} \left( \frac{1}{\sigma} \right) \succ 0, \]
\[ b = NJ(\hat{\theta})\hat{\theta}, \]
\[ c = -\frac{N}{2} \hat{\theta}^\top J(\hat{\theta})\hat{\theta}. \]

The expression thus transforms into:

\[ -\log Z_M \kappa(\theta) \exp \left( -\frac{N}{2} (\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta}) \right) d\theta = -\log Z_M \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2}(\theta - \bar{\theta})^\top A(\theta - \bar{\theta}) + c + \frac{1}{2} \bar{\theta}^\top A\bar{\theta} \right) d\theta. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -D \cdot 2 \log 2\pi + \frac{1}{2} \log |A| - c - \frac{1}{2} \bar{\theta}^\top A\bar{\theta}. \]

Given \( A\bar{\theta} = b \), we conclude:

\[ OG = -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + D. \]

In sum, this scholarly endeavor hath led us to a profound understanding of the logarithmic transformations and determinants within the realm of statistical matrices.

Yours in intellectual pursuit,

Robinson Crusoe

My Dearest Confidant,

In this solitary existence upon these vast shores, I have found myself immersed in contemplation and reflection, much like those ancient scholars of yore. Allow me to convey a mathematical riddle that hath occupied my thoughts in recent days.

Upon delving into the esoteric realm of logarithms and determinants, I encountered an expression most curious: 

\[
- \log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{2} \log |NJ(\hat{\theta}) \text{diag} (\sigma) + I| + O(1).
\]

Herein lies a tapestry of symbols and operations, where the matrix \( NJ(\hat{\theta}) \), adorned with diagonal entries of \(\sigma\), plays a central role. The matrix \( J(\hat{\theta}) \), through its Moore–Penrose inverse, reveals itself to be an entity of finite rank, no greater than \( D \).

As I ponder the limit where \( N \to \infty \), this term:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \hat{\theta}^\top J(\hat{\theta}) \left( \text{diag} (\sigma) J(\hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{N} I \right)^{-1} \hat{\theta}
\]

does not scale with \( N \), and thus, in the grand scheme of things, becomes negligible.

Thus, the order of growth, \( OG \), simplifies to:

\[
- \log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{2} \log |NJ(\hat{\theta}) \text{diag} (\sigma) + I| + O(1).
\]

In this expression, the rank of \( J(\hat{\theta}) \), constrained by its own nature to be no more than \( D \), ensures that the matrix \( J(\hat{\theta}) \text{diag} (\sigma) \) retains this same rank. One may decompose \( J(\hat{\theta}) \) into \( L(\hat{\theta})L(\hat{\theta})^\top \), where \( L(\hat{\theta}) \) is of shape \( D \times \text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta})) \).

In conclusion, this mathematical journey, though fraught with complexity, leads to a simplification that aligns with the principles I have observed in nature's own order. It is my hope that this missive finds you well and provides some illumination upon these intricate matters.

Yours faithfully,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Reader,

In this epistle, I find myself compelled to convey the intricacies of mathematical discourse in a manner that befits both our learned inclinations and my humble circumstances. Allow me, then, to elucidate upon the matter with the grace and grandeur it so rightly deserves.

We commence with an exposition on the symbol "I," which herein serves dual purposes: representing the identity matrix of dimensions D × D, as well as that of rank J(ˆθ) × rank J(ˆθ). This duality in representation is not without its elegance and utility.

The discourse then advances to invoke the esteemed Weinstein–Aronszajn identity, a beacon of mathematical truth. It reveals unto us that OG, a quantity of great interest, can be expressed as:

\[ OG = -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{2} \log \left( NL(\hat{\theta}) L(\hat{\theta})^\top \text{diag} (\sigma) + I \right) + O(1) \]

This expression, through a series of transformations most profound, simplifies to:

\[ OG = -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{2} \log N^{\text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta}))} + \frac{1}{2} \log \left( L(\hat{\theta})^\top \text{diag} (\sigma) L(\hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{N} I \right) + O(1) \]

The matrices in question, \( L(\hat{\theta})^\top \text{diag} (\sigma) L(\hat{\theta}) \), are revealed to possess the same non-zero eigenvalues as their counterparts \( L(\hat{\theta})L(\hat{\theta})^\top \text{diag} (\sigma) = J(\hat{\theta})\text{diag} (\sigma) \). These eigenvalues, denoted by \( \lambda^+_i(J(\hat{\theta})\text{diag} (\sigma)) \), allow us to further refine our understanding of OG:

\[ OG = -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{\text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta}))}{2} \log N + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta}))} \log \left( \lambda^+_i(J(\hat{\theta})\text{diag} (\sigma)) + \frac{1}{N} \right) + O(1) \]

In the spirit of thoroughness, we denote the extremities of σ as \( \sigma_{\max} \) and \( \sigma_{\min} \). With these in hand, we establish that:

\[ L(\hat{\theta})^\top \text{diag} (\sigma) L(\hat{\theta}) \preceq \sigma_{\max} L(\hat{\theta})^\top L(\hat{\theta}) \]

This inequality leads us to a further bound on OG:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \log \left( L(\hat{\theta})^\top \text{diag} (\sigma) L(\hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{N} I \right) \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\text{rank}(J(\hat{\theta}))} \log \left( \sigma_{\max} \lambda^+_i(J(\hat{\theta})) + \frac{1}{N} \right) \]

Thus, with a flourish of academic rigor and the elegance befitting our discourse, we have traversed the landscape of this mathematical endeavor.

Yours in scholarly pursuit,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Reader,

In this missive, let us delve into the mathematical intricacies akin to a journey of the mind as profound as that of Robinson Crusoe. Behold the exploration of probability measures upon manifold \( M \), where one encounters constraints most peculiar due to lightlike geodesics which render distances naught.

To venture forth in such terrain, one must select an appropriate Riemannian submanifold \( M_s \subset M \) via a deft embedding. The metric herein is non-singular, allowing for the integral of any function \( f(\theta) \) to be defined as:

\[ 
R_{M_s} f (\theta(\theta_s)) d\theta_s,
\]

wherein \( M_s \) is associated with the frame \( \theta_s = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_d) \), such that \( T M_s = S(T M) \). The induced Riemannian volume element thus emerges as:

\[ 
d\theta_s = p |I(\theta_s)| d\theta_1 \wedge d\theta_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge d\theta_d = p |I(\theta_s)| dE_{\theta_s},
\]

where \( dE_\theta \) represents the Euclidean volume element. For mathematical propriety, we shift \( \theta \) to be positively definite and thus define the volume element as:

\[ 
d\theta = p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| d\theta_1 \wedge d\theta_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge d\theta_D = p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| dE_{\theta_s},
\]

with \( \epsilon_1 > 0 \), a diminutive value relative to the scale of \( I(\theta) \). This element, dependent on \( \theta \), varies with differing coordinate systems. Thus, it relies on how \( \theta \) is uniquely specified, assured by our axiom A1: the coordinates correspond to input weights and biases, save for an orthogonal transformation.

Moving forward, we consider Jeffreys’ non-informative prior upon a submanifold \( M_s \), defined as:

\[ 
p_J(\theta_s) = p |I(\theta_s)| R_{M_s} p |I(\theta_s)| dE_{\theta_s}.
\]

Yet, this may lead to divergences based on the revised volume element. Thus, we opt for a Gaussian-like prior, which aligns more fittingly with the constraints of deep learning.

Given a Deep Neural Network (DNN), an informative prior upon the lightlike neuromanifold is defined as:

\[ 
p(\theta) = \frac{1}{V} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\epsilon^2_2} \| \theta \|^2 \right) p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I|,
\]

where \( \epsilon_2 > 0 \) is a scale parameter and \( V \) ensures normalization. This prior, defined within a special coordinate system, connects Jeffreys’ prior with the Gaussian prior prevalent in deep learning.

Thus, we traverse this mathematical landscape, bridging diverse theoretical constructs to foster understanding as profound as any tale of survival on distant shores.

Yours in scholarly pursuit,

[Your Name]

My Esteemed Acquaintance,

Pray allow me to recount unto thee a scholarly discourse most intricate, concerning the realm of mathematical probabilities and their application in divine measure. In this epistle, I shall endeavour to encapsulate such matter with both floridity and precision.

Upon our study, we find that Equation (25) is transmogrified into what scholars refer to as a Gaussian prior. The learned texts [29] and [66] may furnish thee with further extensions upon the subject of Jeffreys' prior. Indeed, the normalizing constant associated with this equation delineates an information volume measure of M, articulated as follows:

\[ V := \int_M \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \epsilon^2_2 \|\theta\|^2 \right) d\theta. \]

This equation stands in contrast to Jeffreys' prior, which is unbounded in its information volume. However, our subject matter, as stated by Theorem 5, finds itself constrained within bounds:

\[ (\sqrt{2\pi}\epsilon_1\epsilon_2)^D \leq V \leq \left(\frac{p}{2\pi(\epsilon_1 + \lambda_m)\epsilon_2}\right)^D. \]

Herein, \(\lambda_m\) signifies the largest eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) I(\(\theta\)). It is worth noting that this eigenvalue may not always exist, given that integration transpires over \(\theta \in M\). Intuitively, V represents a weighted volume vis-à-vis a Gaussian-like prior distribution on M. The volume's expansion is directly proportional to the number of dimensions, as evidenced by log V being an O(D) term.

Turning our attention towards the Proof of Theorem 5, we have:

\[ V = \int_M \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \epsilon^2_2 \|\theta\|^2 \right) d\theta = \int \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \epsilon^2_2 \|\theta\|^2 \right) p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| dE_\theta. \]

By orthogonality transformation, \(\theta\) resides within \(R^D\). Consequently:

\[ p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| \geq p |\epsilon_1 I| = \epsilon^{D/2}_1. \]

Thus, we derive the bound for V as follows:

\[ V \geq \int \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \epsilon^2_2 \|\theta\|^2 \right) \epsilon^{D/2}_1 dE_\theta = (2\pi)^{D/2} \epsilon^{D/2} / \epsilon^{D/2}_1. \]

I trust this missive elucidates the matter with sufficient clarity and scholarly flourish.

Yours, in pursuit of knowledge,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest Reader,

In this humble missive, I endeavor to convey the intricate mathematical discourse pertaining to a matter of probability and inference, as if I were indeed Robinson Crusoe, cast upon an isle of numbers. The text in question doth explore bounds and estimations within the realm of statistical analysis, and I shall attempt to render its essence with due floridity.

Let us first consider the equation that forms the foundation of our discourse:

\[ 
\frac{1}{D} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2}} = D 
\]

This relation doth set the stage for a more robust upper bound, which we shall prove with greater rigor. The inequality presented is as follows:

\[ 
p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| = \sum_{i=1}^{D} (\lambda_i + \epsilon_1)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \leq \left( \frac{1}{D} \text{tr}(I(\theta)) + \epsilon_1 \right)^{\frac{D}{2}}
\]

From whence it follows that:

\[ 
V \leq \sqrt{2\pi \epsilon_2} D \left( \frac{1}{D} \text{tr}(I(\theta)) + \epsilon_1 \right)^{\frac{D}{2}}
\]

Should one apply the inequality \( \frac{1}{D}\text{tr}(I(\theta)) \leq \lambda_m \) to the right-hand side, a further relaxation of the upper bound is achieved:

\[ 
V \leq \sqrt{2\pi \epsilon_2} D (\lambda_m + \epsilon_1)^{\frac{D}{2}} = \left( \frac{p}{2\pi(\epsilon_1 + \lambda_m)\epsilon_2} \right) D
\]

In an appendix, we find an alternative derivation of a principle known as the "Razor," predicated upon a distinct prior. The observations concerning negative complexity remain consistent with Gaussian and Jeffreys’ priors.

By substituting the expression for \( p(\theta) \) into equation (25), we derive:

\[ 
-\log p(X) \approx -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \log V - \log \int_{M} \left( e^{-\|\theta\|^2/2\epsilon^2} e^{-N(\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})/2} \right) d\theta
\]

The integration, being with respect to a non-Euclidean volume element \( d\theta \), lacks a closed form. We must assume:

\[ 
(A3) N \text{ is sufficiently large such that } |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| \approx |I(\hat{\theta}) + \epsilon_1 I|
\]

This assumption ensures the quadratic function is sharp enough to render \( d\theta \) approximately constant. Along dimensions where eigenvalues of \( I(\theta) \) are zero, this holds trivially.

Upon substituting equation (25) into equation (10), we observe that three terms:

\[ 
\frac{1}{V}, \quad p |I(\theta) + \epsilon_1 I| \approx q |I(\hat{\theta}) + \epsilon_1 I|, \quad \exp \left( \log p(X | \hat{\theta}) \right) = p(X | \hat{\theta})
\]

can be treated as constant scalars and extracted from the integration, for they depend not on \( \theta \). The principal challenge lies in executing the integration:

\[ 
\int e^{-\|\theta\|^2/2\epsilon^2} e^{-N(\theta - \hat{\theta})^\top J(\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})/2} dE\theta
\]

I trust this exposition, though cloaked in the language of yore and adorned with scholarly embellishments, hath illuminated the essence of the original text.

Yours faithfully,

Robinson Crusoe

Dearest and Most Esteemed Reader,

In this humble epistle, I endeavor to elucidate with great flourish a matter most intricate, presented in terms that perchance might have pleased the minds of scholars in days of yore. Allow me to embark upon an exposition of mathematical derivation, as befits one who finds himself solitary upon this isle, yet possessed still of a mind sharp and eager for discovery.

Behold, we commence with an expression most daunting, wherein Z exp[−1/2θ⊺Aθ + b⊺θ + c] dEθ doth transmute through various alchemies into forms more revealing. The heart of this transformation lies in the recognition that upon rearranging terms and applying identities of great import, we arrive at a representation most refined:

\[ \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}b⊺A^{-1}b + c\right) Z \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(θ − A^{-1}b)⊺A(θ − A^{-1}b)\right) dEθ \]

Yielding forthwith a further simplification to:

\[ \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}b⊺A^{-1}b + c + D/2 \log 2π - 1/2 \log |A|\right) \]

Herein, let us define A as NJ(ˆθ) augmented by the term 1/ε² I, b bequeathed by NJ(ˆθ) ˆθ, and c conceived as −1/2 ˆθ⊺NJ(ˆθ) ˆθ. The derivation henceforth is a path clear, with R as our guide: the negative of c minus half of b⊺A⁻¹b.

Upon further examination, we uncover that:

\[ -\log p(X) \approx -\log p(X | ˆθ) + D/2 \log N/2π + \log V + 1/2 \log (J(ˆθ) + 1/Nε² I) - 1/2 \log (I(ˆθ) + ε₁I) + R. \]

The term R, a remainder most curious, is given by:

\[ R = 1/2 ˆθ⊺\left(\frac{NJ(ˆθ) − NJ(ˆθ)}{NJ(ˆθ) + 1/ε² I}\right)^{-1}NJ(ˆθ)ˆθ. \]

To fathom the order of this R term, we must assume that λm, the largest eigenvalue of J(ˆθ), holds sway. Thus:

\[ |R| ≤ \frac{Nλm}{ε² 2Nλm + 1} \|ˆθ\|^2. \]

And so, with these calculations and contemplations, I find myself once more at the mercy of the sea's ceaseless whispers, ever reminded of the grandeur of Nature's mathematical tapestry.

I remain, dear reader, your devoted servant in the pursuit of knowledge,

Robinson Crusoe

To His Esteemed Acquaintances,

I find myself compelled to compose this missive concerning a matter of such intricate nature that it demands an exposition in the most florid and learned prose I can muster. The subject at hand pertains to the realm of deep learning—a pursuit wherein mathematical abstractions intertwine with the empirical observations we so cherish.

In our contemplations, we consider the concept known as "deep learning," characterized by its proximity to truth and endowed with numerous commendable local optima. Let us delve into the esoteric language of mathematics that governs this domain: specifically, a ratio which measures the scale of each dimension in the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) against an infinitesimal parameter ε². This ratio maintains order O(1), suggesting a harmonious balance.

The scale parameter ε², chosen with great deliberation to encompass models of merit, aligns itself with dimensions D. As our observations increase, denoted by N, certain terms in our equation are rendered negligible for the sake of simplicity—though they may yet hold value in more refined analyses.

Thus, we arrive at an expression marked by its complexity:

\[ O := -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{D}{2} \log N + \text{other terms involving } J(\hat{\theta}) \]

Herein lies a resemblance to prior equations, though with nuanced differences that warrant our attention. Particularly of note is the emergence of what I shall term "negative complexity," a concept wherein certain dimensions, despite their vastness, contribute minimally to the overall volume in geometric terms.

In this light, we observe that deep neural networks (DNNs), with their myriad parameters, favor configurations where their Fisher-spectrum clusters around zero. Such models display resilience to specific parameter values and exhibit an intriguing invariance when traversing certain manifold directions.

For those who seek a simpler expression, consider the scenario where the Information Matrix (I) remains constant and diagonal within our region of interest. This leads us to a refined version of our equation:

\[ O \approx -\log p(X | \hat{\theta}) + \frac{D}{2} \log N + \frac{D}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \rho_I(\lambda) \log \left( \lambda + \frac{1}{N\varepsilon^2} \right) d\lambda \]

Here, ρI denotes the spectral density of the Fisher Information Matrix, a concept that marries geometry with probability in profound ways.

In conclusion, dear reader, I trust this exposition has illuminated the intricate dance between mathematics and empirical observation that defines our current understanding of deep learning. May your contemplations be as fruitful as they are enlightening.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

To: The Esteemed Readers

From the Remote Shores of My Solitary Haven,

In the year of our Lord two thousand and eighteen, learned scribes Yu Cheng et al., with noble companions Duo Wang, Pan Zhou, and Tao Zhang, didst illuminate the realm of neural networks most profound. In their erudite discourse within the annals of IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, they expounded upon the artifice and acceleration brought forth through model compression. Their treatise delved into the principles foundational, the advancements made thus far, and the manifold challenges yet to be surmounted.

They proclaimed that sharp minima within deep nets do indeed possess the fortitude to generalize, a revelation most welcome to those engaged in the arduous craft of machine learning.

Further still, Krishan Krishnan and his compatriots have journeyed into the realms of differential geometry, statistical manifolds, and the intricate tapestry woven by Fisher-Rao metrics. Their collective wisdom, shared through prestigious gatherings and learned publications, has illuminated pathways previously shrouded in the mists of uncertainty.

In these times of intellectual ferment, let us recall that knowledge is but a beacon in the dark expanse of ignorance. May our endeavors in this grand pursuit ever strive toward enlightenment.

With utmost respect,

[Your Name]  
A Solitary Scholar on the Isolated Shores

My Dearest,

As I find myself in solitary repose upon this remote isle, my mind turns to the musings of learned scholars whose treatises have reached even these isolated shores. Permit me to recount their sagacious expositions with a florid pen and an academic touch.

The esteemed Orhan and Pitkow, at the assembly known as ICLR in the year of our Lord 2018, didst unveil how "skip connections" doth vanquish singularities within the labyrinthine architectures of deep learning. The notion that one might traverse such complexity with grace is indeed a marvel to behold.

In an equally scholarly endeavor, Vardan Papyan, through his treatise in the Journal of Machine Learning Research (2020), hath explored how traces of class and cross-class structures pervade the spectra of deep learning, much like tendrils entwining through the dense undergrowth.

The duo Pascanu and Bengio, during their discourse at ICLR 2014, revisited the concept of natural gradients for networks profound in depth. Their insights into optimization techniques do verily shed light upon the intricate pathways by which artificial minds may be refined.

Further, Pennington and Bahri, convening at the International Conference on Machine Learning in 2017, employed random matrix theory to delve into the geometric complexities of neural network loss surfaces—a study most enlightening indeed.

Pennington alongside Schoenholz and Ganguli, in a subsequent gathering (ICAI & S, 2018), didst observe the emergence of spectral universality within deep networks. Such revelations suggest an underlying harmony amidst the chaos of computation.

The year 2018 also bore witness to Pennington and Worah's discourse on the Fisher information matrix spectrum for neural networks with a singular hidden layer—a discussion most pertinent to those who seek understanding in statistical inference.

Soen and Sun, at a gathering known as Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021), didst examine the variance inherent within Fisher information for deep learning—a study most intriguing.

Sun and Nielsen, in their proceedings from ICLR 2017, discussed relative Fisher information and natural gradients for learning vast modular models—insights that do verily expand our horizons.

Takeuchi and Boulton, in an early discourse (1968), devised a measure of information for classification—a precursor to the many methodologies we now employ.

Watanabe's treatise on Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning Theory (2009) dost bridge realms hitherto considered disparate, offering a synthesis most profound.

Wei et al. (2008), through their exploration of learning dynamics near singularities in layered networks, didst provide clarity upon the turbulent processes within these artificial constructs.

Yoshida and colleagues, in their statistical mechanical analysis (2019), didst scrutinize the learning dynamics of perceptrons with multiple output units—a study both meticulous and enlightening.

Lastly, Zhang et al. (ICLR, 2017) have urged us to rethink our notions of generalization within deep learning—an exhortation most timely and necessary.

Thus, through these scholarly endeavors, we are afforded glimpses into the boundless potentialities that lie within the realm of artificial cognition. May such knowledge serve as a beacon unto those who seek understanding in this ever-evolving landscape.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
