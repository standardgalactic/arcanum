means a “weighted volume” of f
M, where the weights ω(ξ) are determined by the observed FIM
J(ˆξ) and satisfy 0 < ω(ξ) ≤1. Combining these two terms, the model complexity is the log-ratio
between the unweighted volume and the weighted volume and is lower bounded by 0.

where ζ = Q⊺ξ is an orthogonal transformation of ξ, and OJ is invariant to such transformations.
If an eigenvalue of J(ˆξ) has an order of o( 1
N ), the last two terms in eq. (17) cancel out in the
corresponding direction, meaning no complexity is added. This is similar to how the positive and
negative complexity terms cancel out in eq. (15) – small eigenvalues of J(ˆξ) are helpful to enhance
the representation power of DNNs without increasing the model complexity. Only eigenvalues
that are large enough contribute significantly to the model complexity.
In the rest of this section, we connect with previous formulations of MDL [7, 44]. If J(ˆξ) has
full rank, we can further write

By assumption (A6), the RHS of eq. (16) is well defined, while the RHS of eq. (18) is only
meaningful for a full rank J(ˆξ). If J(ˆξ) is not invertible, one can consider the limit case when the
zero eigenvalues of J(ˆξ) are replaced by a small ϵ > 0 and still enjoy the expression in eq. (18).
One has to note that

as the internal is over f

resembles an expectation w.r.t. a Gaussian distribution centered at ˆξ on f
