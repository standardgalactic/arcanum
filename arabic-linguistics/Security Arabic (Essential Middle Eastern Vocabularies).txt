USER GUIDE 
 
To enhance your ability to recall the vocabulary and 
to pronounce it correctly, this book is accompanied 
by audio recordings and audio-visual e-Flashcards 
of the entire contents of each chapter, recorded in 
both English and Arabic. This e-Learning material 
is provided in two formats: 1. Audio recordings 
compatible with iPods and other devices (via MP3 
files on the CD accompanying this book and via 
http://www.euppublishing.com/page/emev/e-learning); 
2. Audio-visual e-Flashcards (via http://www. 
euppublishing.com/page/emev/e-learning). Material 
on the website requires access token 46616Eva. 
 
Audio recordings 
Main features 
● Each Arabic term is recorded with authentic native 
pronunciation at normal speed.  
● Each Arabic term is preceded by its equivalent in 
English. 
● Each chapter is recorded as a single MP3 track (the 
track numbers correspond to the chapter numbers, 
e.g. Track 01 = Chapter 1). 
● The audio files can be played on a computer or 
transferred to an MP3 device (e.g. iPod, mobile 
phone, etc.), enabling you to study on the move. 
 
Tips 
● Make sure that you engage actively with the audio 
recordings by repeating each Arabic term during 
the pause. 

 
USER GUIDE • vii 
● Pause the recording and challenge yourself to 
produce the Arabic word before it is announced. 
 
Audio-visual e-Flashcards 
Main features 
● Designed with the language-learning software Before 
You Know It (BYKI), available as a free download 
suitable for Windows or Mac at www.byki.com/fls 
(select ‘Arabic’ as your chosen language). 
● Each e-Flashcard contains the English term on one 
side and the Arabic on the reverse. 
● Each Arabic term is recorded with authentic native 
pronunciation. 
● The native speaker sound can be slowed down for 
paced listening. 
● Vocabulary acquisition is accelerated through a 
variety of fun interactive self-assessment 
activities. 
 
Tips 
Keep track of your progress through BYKI’s 
interactive self-assessment modes: 
● Preview it: learn and review the vocabulary in e-
Flashcard mode including audio, without being 
assessed. 
● Recognise it: test your recognition of the 
vocabulary in English from the Arabic side, and 
vice versa. 
● Produce it: test your knowledge of the vocabulary 
in English by typing its translation in Arabic, and 
vice versa.

INTRODUCTION 
Middle East security issues remain prominent in the 
Arab, Western and wider media, and are followed
closely by public and private sector organisations
worldwide, in areas of foreign policy, international
cooperation 
and 
development, 
defence 
and
academia. Arabic security terminology is constantly
evolving, as new words and terms are coined and
new concepts integrated. This ‘quick-fix’ vocabulary
of security and intelligence Arabic is essential to
students of Arabic, primarily at intermediate and
advanced levels, and to individuals or organisations
engaging with the Arab world. 
As part of the Essential Middle Eastern 
Vocabularies series, this book aims to provide the
core Arabic vocabulary for the topics of security and 
intelligence, to facilitate easy learning, reference and
translation of terminology between Arabic and 
English. The book will prove indispensable for
anyone developing or using Arabic skills in these
and other subject areas, whether for discussion,
interpreting, 
reading, 
translation, 
listening
comprehension or for interacting with Arabic
speakers or Arab TV, radio or internet sources. 
The book comprises thirteen chapters covering
primary security and intelligence topics: General;
Global Security; Organisations; Energy Security;
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD); Defence &
Military; Law Enforcement; Counter Terrorism;
Human Intelligence; Communications Technology; 
Information Technology; Information Security;
Intelligence Analysis. The vocabulary featured here 
 

2 • INTRODUCTION 
is not exhaustive. It is derived from internet and 
other research on current usage and from files and 
databases developed in support of training and
language work, built from on-the-job experience in 
the relevant fields. Every effort has been made to
place terminology in the most appropriate chapter
and to avoid repetition as far as possible. Instead of
relying upon alphabetical lists, chapters are arranged
to follow an internal logic which aids learning
within a conceptual and/or linguistic framework. An 
alphabetised English index is provided at the end of 
the book for convenient reference. 
 
Notes on the formal presentation 
Vowelling has not been included, except in First 
Form verbs. These are supplied in the form of the 
basic stem (past tense masculine singular, with the 
middle vowel marked where it is not a fatha) 
followed by the present tense (masculine singular), 
with the masdar given in brackets. Shadda has been 
omitted on a final ‘ya’ where it simply indicates a
nisba adjective. Guidance on pronunciation is 
provided by the accompanying CD and the audio-
visual e-Flashcards, available online. 
Nouns are generally presented in the indefinite 
form, but the definite article is used to reflect 
common 
usage 
with 
generic 
concepts 
and 
compound nouns. Noun plurals have been included
(separated from the singular by a comma) only
where these are commonly found in use and not easy
to predict. 
I would like to thank Lis Kendall for her support 
and insights during the preparation of this book.

Thanks also to Mourad Diouri for his contributions

of interest and use in developing your own

language.
