APPENDIX A: Chess Problem Composing Steps 
 
 
Chess problems for this research were composed automatically using CHESTHETICA (see Figure 9) following 
the essential steps below. It is a modification of the approach used in (Iqbal, 2011). The problems composed are 
limited to orthodox mate-in-3 problems in standard international chess.  
 
1. Obtain the two new DSNS strings produced from the DSNS process (see section 3.1). 
2. Set the total number of white pieces and black pieces that can be used in the composition. There are 
two attribute values pertaining to these features in each DSNS string. 
a. 
For example, if in string 1 the white piece count is 5 and in string 2 the white piece count is 
10, the range possible for this computer composition is between 5 and 10. The same for the 
black pieces.
