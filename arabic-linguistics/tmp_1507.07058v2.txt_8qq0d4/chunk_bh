move can stop only one of the threatened mates. No duals. 
nice geometric moves by the newly promoting queen... 
long moves... 
26 
Dual after 1...Rd1+ 2.Sxd1. Flight taking key. wSe3 could be 
removed, by placing for instance wK on g2 and wRc4 on c5. 
very obvious... not taking the rook is ok.. but still... 
27 
Double solution: 1.Rxb2! ~ 2.Ra7/Rd7 ~ 3.Ra1/Rd1#. Dual in 
the intention after 2...c5 3.Rd1#. The threat is unstoppable - no 
real fight by Black. 
not unexpected at all 
28 
Duals after 1...Sd3+ 2.Ke3/Kg3/Kg5. Key takes three flights 
and threatens a short mate. Poorly constructed position, with 
duals in the second variation: 1...Sg2+ 2.Ke5/Kg5/Kg3/Ke4. 
ignoring the en-prise knight... still, too straightforward 
29 
Flight taking key, threatening a short mate. Black defense pins 
wQ, but the pin is released through a brutal capture of pinner. 
Duals: 2...a3 3.Qb7/Qb8#. Nothing subtle. 
actually the only way by far... that's quite nice, but still not 
very beautiful 
lots of pieces and pawns makes it more difficult for the 
computers to compose...
30 
Another horrible key, taking the most prominent black figure 
(bQ). 2...Bc6 ensures that 3.Qb7# is avoided. wSs can be traded 
for wPe2, when bQ is replaced on d3: 1.exd3! 
some checkmate combination with an underpromotion to a 
knight would be beautiful, capturing the black queen on the 
first move isn't 
31 
Straightforward play, with no surprises. There is a dual 2.b8=R 
which occurs after 1...g2. No need to have black pawns on the 
board. 
Black pawns d4 and g3 are seemingly useless.
very plain 
 
32 
Multiple duals in intention after 1...Se5 
2.Bb3/Bd5/Be6/Ba3/Bb4/Bc5/Kc8. The flight taking key is not 
pleasant. 
the helpless black knight, a unique solution... 
33 
Double solution: 1.Rc6! with the following variations: 
1...Rh8/Rh6 2.Re7+ Kf8 3.d8=Q# and 1...Kf8/Kg8/Kf7 
2.d8=Q[+] ~ 3.Re7#. Bad key taking three flights. 
the most obvious solution 
34 
The second variation 1...Kf8 2.Sg6+ Kg8 3.Rg7# enhances the 
content of this composition. The key is not bad and a better one 
can not be found. Best from the lot. 
This is clearly the best of the lot. A human composer would 
even consider publishing this composition! 
too simple 
 
35 
Duals: 2.bxa8=R/B/S/Kxa8. The second variation 1...Re2 2.h7 
adds some interest. The key takes an unprovided flight and 
creates a short threat. 
1... Re2 2. h7 with an overloaded black rook would be 
slightly more pretty... just giving the rook away is not 

36 
Duals: 3.Qf5# and 2.Kd3 Kf3(Ke5) 3.Rf6(Qe4/Qg5)#. With 
same material, Healey created a memorable composition (Kd6, 
Qf2, Rc5, pc3 - Kd3): 1.Kd7 Ke4 2.Rd5 Kxd5 3.Qd4#. 
the pawn unexpectedly joins in the checkmating 
construction.. also the only way for #3... quite nice 
the role of the pawn in this checkmate in terms of 
making this composition appealing has to be 
appreciated... seems humanlike perception of beauty
37 
Duals in the main variation: 3.Qb6/Qc8# and 2.d8=R ~ 
3.Rdc8#. The key is not very good, because wR is en prise in 
the initial position. 
too obvious 
38 
Dual: 2.Bd8 (instead of 2.Bf4+), avoidable by shifting wBc7 to 
b8. Again a major promotion key taking three flights. Second 
variation 1...Kh4 2.Bf4/Bd8 Kh5 3.Qg5#. 
too obvious 
39 
Double solutions: 1.Rh1! Bb1 2.Rxb1 Ka5/Ka3 3.Ra1# and 
1.Rh8! Be8 2.Rxe8 Ka5/Ka3 3.Ra8#. Duals in the intention 
after 1...Ka5 any waiting move e.g. 2.Kf7/Rb8/Rc6 etc. will 
mate. 
too obvious 
40 
Dual after 2...Kh4 3.Rh7#. Give and take key introducing a 
short threat, with wR playing from en prise position. 
1. Rg8 is not the first move that comes too mind.. that 
slightly contributes to the aesthetic value 
41 
Multiple duals: 2.Rh6/Rf6/Sc3/Se3. The key is awful, capturing 
the only black unit left on the board (bQ). Everything is very 
obvious. 
too straightforward 
42
