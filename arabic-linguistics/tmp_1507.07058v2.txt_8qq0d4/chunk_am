TG1500 samples contrasted against variations of each where only 150 objects were used (instead of 300) and 
also against the same sample size but where only 5 attributes were used, i.e. the first 5 attributes (see section 
4.3). The automatic composing process (see Appendix A) would simply skip the constraints that depended upon 
the missing attributes. Comp3.5 and TG1500 were used because these had, respectively, the highest and lowest 
aesthetics scores (see Table 5). The results are shown in Tables 9 and 10.

Table 10:  Mean aesthetics scores and variations for the compositions generated 
(one low quality source, variable objects and attributes). 
 
For Comp3.5 (300 objects, 10 attributes) against Comp3.5 (150 objects, 10 attributes), the difference between 
the mean aesthetics scores based on a TTEV test was statistically significant: t(148) = 2.439, P = 0.0159. For 
Comp3.5 (300 objects, 10 attributes) against Comp3.5 (300 objects, 5 attributes), the difference between the 
mean aesthetics scores based on the same test was statistically significant as well: t(169) = 2.749, P = 0.0033. 
This suggests that, given a high quality chess source, using more objects or using more attributes improves the 
quality of the generated compositions, which implies scalability of the DSNS approach. There were no 
differences of statistical significance (TTUV) between the average number of variations comparing the same 
groups. 
 
For TG1500 (300 objects, 10 attributes) against TG1500 (150 objects, 10 attributes), the difference between the 
mean aesthetics scores based on a TTEV test was not statistically significant. For TG1500 (300 objects, 10 
attributes) against TG1500 (300 objects, 5 attributes), the difference between the mean aesthetics scores based 
on a TTUV test was not statistically significant either. This suggests that using more objects or more attributes 
makes no difference given a low quality chess source. There were no differences of statistical significance 
(TTUV) between the average number of variations comparing the same groups. We also tested a merged set, i.e. 
TG1500p (see previous section) using just 150 objects and 5 attributes as follows; for the photos, we used the 
first 5 attributes (see section 4.3).
