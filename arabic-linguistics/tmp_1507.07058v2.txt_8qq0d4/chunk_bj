Key captures the remaining black officer, but provides a flight. 
Two ideal mirror echo mates delivered thanks to zugzwang, the 
second after 1...Kc6 2.Rb4 Kd6 3.Rb6#. 
Two echo variations - something that humans will 
appreciate and try to create. 
Plain 
 
60 
Duals: 3.Rh5/Rh6#. Other not dualistic variations: 1...Kg6 
2.Rxc6+ Kh7 3.Re7/Rh5/Rh6# and 1...Rxb6 2.Qf7+ Kh6(Kh8) 
3.Rh5(Re8)#. Key takes three flights, though. 
obvious... still, at least the rook wasn't captured 
immediately 
61 
Key takes three flights, defending the wS en prise. No real 
fight: white threat can not be actually stopped. 
obvious, but looks efficient 
62 
Only two flights taken by key - defect would have been 
avoided by putting wQ initially on e7 (or Kb4 Qf6 Sf3 - Kd5; 
B: wQf6 -> e8). Continued zugzwang and midboard mate. 
An appealing diagonal mate. An equally appealing setting 
would be Kc4 Qd4 Sh4 - Ke4. 
nice geometry, unique solution... quite pretty 
very appealing... the quality of this problem seems to be 
much higher than of the average problem here... hence 
the decision 
63 
Single line, but key is obvious, defending wR en prise. Black 
active distant selfblock is exploited in the mate. 
For the nice symmetry - asymmetry. 
nice geometry, unique solution, minor pieces... pretty.. still 
relatively obvious (hard to decide whether or not it was 
composed by a human) 
it was quite difficult to decide on this one... still, the 
minor pieces combine an appealing net... and it is 
probably relatively difficult computationally to operate 
with this subset of pieces
64 
Flight taking first move followed by flight taking second move 
with imparable mate. Pretty ordinary combination, often seen 
in practice. 
obvious 
65 
Major promotion threatens three short mates. Main variation 
spoilt by many duals: 1...Bce7 
2.Qb3+/Qb5+/Qb7+/Qb6/Qc7/Qc8. Second bB not justified. 
diagonal check on white squares vs. the opposite color 
bishops.. but still not really beautiful 
66 
Clear single line, with forced continuation. Key takes flight and 
stops pawn's advance. bPe5 used in order to avoid stalemate. 
Just for the fact that Re4-c4 and Rc4-e4 are equipollent 
vectors and Kb1, Bc2, Re4 are aligned on the same 
diagonal. Many similar settings are possible. 
very straightforward 
 
67 
Double solutions: 1.Qg1/Qg6! with two unstoppable threats: 
2.Qg2+ Kh4 3.Qg4# and 2.Qg4+ Kh2 3.Qg2# (also 1.Qf2 
cooks). Duals in the intention: 2.Qc7/Qf2/Qg1. Flight taking 
key. 
mating net with bishop and knight.. the second move (Qb8) 
is certainly more beautiful than 2.Qf2... 
68 
Nice minor promotion, but bad key taking flight. A better 
presentation of this idea was shown by Mackenzie (Kc6, Bb8, 
pc7 - Ka8): 1.Ba7 Kxa7 2.c8=R Ka6 3.Ra8# with stalemate 
avoidance. 
For the minor promotions. Human even composed the 
following: Ke4 pc7 d6 e7 f6 g7 - Ke6: 1.e8=B Kxd6(Kxf6) 
2.c8=R(g8=R) Ke6 3.Rc6(Rg6)#. Are computers able to do 
something similar? 
underpromotion to a rook is nice... also this is a unique 
solution... with so little pieces.. quite pretty.. although easy 
to find 
 
69 
Dual 3.Qa6#. Again the key takes an unprovided flight and the 
second move captures the remaining officer, hence putting 
black in zugzwang. 
not capturing the knight on the first move... still, an 
obvious solution 
70 
No surprise: key takes flight, second move takes main black 
officer and unavoidable mate follows. No real fight. 
a unique solution... each piece takes part.. black succeeds 
promoting to a queen, still helpless against the timely 
mate... pretty (and quite humanlike if it was composed by 
the computer) 
such geometry is something that humans know to 
appreciate (and compose)
71 
Double solution: 1.d8=S! ~ 2.Ba7/Bb7/Bf2/Bg1 ~ 3.Sc7/Sf4#. 
In the intention Black can not parry the threat - actually no real 
fight. 
many alternatives for black, but Qd8-c8-c4 is always 
decisive in time... quite pretty! 
the fact that the same maneuver wins in all variations
