of height, width and length to build a new box. The box-building system is not part of the DSNS approach itself. 
  
3.2 
Using Different Domains 
 
If objects from two different domains should be integrated using the DSNS approach, the process is the same except 
that two deviations are generated. Each deviation is obtained by choosing two random DSNS strings from the same 
domain, following the steps described in the previous section. These two deviations are then ‘merged’. So if the first 
domain was chess problems and the second music, and the first deviation obtained was 126.21 whereas the second 
was 35722.11 (the numbers can be quite different), the two deviations can be merged as shown in Figure 1. If an 
object from the chess problem domain was desired, then the deviation value would need to relate to that domain, i.e. 
be the sort of number that a deviation derived entirely from objects in that domain would look like. However, with 
two deviations and only one of them relating to the chess problem domain, they need to be merged as shown on the 
left side of Figure 1. This may be seen as a sort of ‘lateral thinking’ approach to merging the two unrelated deviation 
values so they become functionally one in the desired or target domain.

Figure 1: Merging deviations from different domains. 
 
What happens is the chess problem deviation (i.e. 126.21) is placed in the first row with the music deviation (i.e. 
35722.11) directly beneath it, aligning the digits so they match. The ‘3’ and ‘5’ are simply crossed out because there 
are no digits of that value in the row above. The remaining digits follow this rule: If [top digit] modulo [bottom digit] 
                                                                                                                                                        
work as well. Indeed, there are likely hundreds of different ways the DSNS approach could be executed differently but we had to decide on the one 
we expected to work best.  
12 The sample of 300, in this case, is used simply because it was the source of the original two DSNS strings and readily available. A 
slightly larger or even smaller ‘knowledge base’ (e.g. 290, 310) to look through can also be used at this point but it would likely not have a 
significant impact on the result. On the other hand, a much larger knowledge base of say, 600 or even 1,000 objects (even from an altogether 
different sample than the two strings came from) might yield better results. 
13 The approach we suggest is to randomly select new values for all the attributes in each tentatively new string at the same time before 
testing to see if the new strings produce the desired deviation. Systematically changing the value of just one attribute in either string to see if 
it brings you closer to the desired deviation is also possible, as are presumably other methods. 

= 0 then result = [bottom digit] else result = [top digit]. So the result here is 122.11. On the right side of Figure 1, a 
deviation relating to the music domain is desired so that deviation is put in the first row with the chess problem 
domain deviation in the second. The ‘3’ and ‘5’ in this case simply ‘fall down’ and the remaining digits follow the 
same rule mentioned above. The result in both cases (i.e. the last row) is a single deviation value that can be used as 
described in section 3.1 (the fourth step) to generate two new DSNS strings. In some cases there may be no difference 
at all between the merged deviation and the original deviation from the same domain. This process of merging may 
reflect or mimic the imperfect recollection of information by humans which inherently produces variation that can be 
functional in the creative thought process. In other words, they recall information that is similar and functional in the 
domain but not necessarily identical to what they have seen before. We consider this to be self-evident as well.
