robot capable of fully exploring its environment, using a variety of senses; perhaps even more and more 
sensitive than our own. A robot that is able to automatically extract attributes or features from the objects it 
perceives and ‘pool’ them together in the form of DSNS strings in its computerized brain. These strings will 
then be free to mingle until something of value – in any domain the robot is familiar with – can likely be 
produced. The robot would have a built-in system of trial and error that learns automatically which 
combinations of attributes from which domains produce the best results and would create a cycle of consistently 
improving output. This process would be, in principle, inexhaustible because the same creative objects produced 
can then be fed back into the robot’s perception for further processing, assuming an ever-changing environment 
was not enough. A reality in the not-so-distant future, perhaps. In any case, at the very least, the DSNS approach 
has been shown to be quite good at composing valid chess problems of the three-move variety (that requires 
creativity). This is what we set out to do and have hopefully demonstrated in this article. 
 
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) in Malaysia under their 
eScienceFund research grant (01-02-03-SF0240). We would also like to sincerely thank Vlaicu Crisan who provided 
detailed feedback pertaining to the DSNS-generated compositions, and Cameron Browne for his various contributions 
to the project. 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
21 This is with reference to ‘traditional’ chess problems that must abide by various composition conventions; not all of which have aesthetic 
merit. However, there is a new, comparable class of chess problems known as ‘chess constructs’ which have aesthetic value yet need not 
abide by such conventions (Iqbal, 2014b, 2014c). These are therefore less esoteric and more accessible to a wider audience of players and 
composers. By this standard, the compositions generated are likely of even higher quality.
