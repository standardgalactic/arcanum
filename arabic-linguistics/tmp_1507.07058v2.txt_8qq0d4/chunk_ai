Table 4:  Compositions generated by CHESTHETICA using the DSNS approach (one domain) in 24 hours total. 
   
The average composing rate (using the DSNS approach) for PC 1 was 5.27 compositions per hour (cph) whereas 
for PC 2 it was 4.23 cph. The sample sizes are too small, at this point, for statistical analysis but it is fair to 
assume that processing power and memory do not make very much of a difference in this case. Table 5 shows 
the mean aesthetics scores and variations for the (total) generated compositions derived from each set. The 
                                                 
17 Alan Turing proposed slightly different values, i.e. P=1, N = 3, B = 3.5, R = 5, Q = 10 (Turing, 1953). 

higher the number of variations, the ‘richer’ or ‘more complex’ the composition is typically regarded to be, 
according to convention. Despite the precision of these aesthetics scores they are typically used for ranking 
purposes. One should therefore not make claims that an aesthetics score of 2.0 implies that a composition is 
twice as beautiful as one with an aesthetics score of 1.0. At the same time, a small yet statistically significant 
difference in mean aesthetics (between groups) is not necessarily meaningless. A single factor analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) test was performed across all the five sets comparing the aesthetics means and the 
differences were found to be statistically significant: F (4, 667) = 4.33, p = 0.0018. Even excluding the ‘random 
approach’ control, the differences in means were still statistically significant: F (3, 452) = 3.14, p = 0.0251.

So we see a clear distinction in mean aesthetic value between compositions generated from higher quality 
sources (Comp3.5, TG2500) and lower quality sources (Comp1.25, TG1500) using the DSNS approach. 
Interestingly, compositions generated using higher quality tournament games fared slightly better, aesthetically, 
than low quality compositions. The random approach, expectedly, fared the poorest aesthetically. There was no 
statistically significant difference in the mean variations across all the five sets. This supports previous work that 
suggested variations are relevant but only to a point (Iqbal et al., 2012). In other words, simply having more 
variations does not necessarily imply higher aesthetic quality.

The Second Experiment: Different Domains 
 
The first experiment (see section 4.3) demonstrated that the DSNS approach can indeed produce compositions 
of higher creative value (than a purely random approach) based on the sources used for the DSNS strings. In the 
second experiment, we tested to see if materials sourced from different domains could also be used successfully. 
The four domains included: renowned human artworks (i.e. paintings), computer-generated abstract art pieces 
(from the Elvira system), photographs (with people in them, but not selfies) and renowned classical music 
pieces. The paintings, photographs and music were identified and selected (300 objects each) by a female 
research assistant18 who is also a co-author. The abstract art pieces (1,000 in total) were supplied by another two 
co-authors and from these, the first 300 based on the file names were used. These pieces were created using the 
Elvira system (Colton et al., 2011). The selection process of these objects were considered sufficiently random 
for our purposes. 
 
The paintings and classical music pieces were considered high quality sources in contrast to the abstract art 
pieces that were computer-evolved and considered of comparatively lower quality. The photographs were 
considered to be of ‘moderate’ quality; perhaps somewhere between the computer-evolved abstract art pieces 
and the renowned paintings. Each of these four sets of 300 objects were divided into subsets of 150 as in the 
first experiment. The same DSNS approach was then used; refer to section 3.2 for information about merging 
deviations from different domains. The attributes used for the paintings, photographs and abstract art pieces are 
as follows. As with the chess domain they represent unique features that a human observer might notice or be 
able to find out. Similarly they are arbitrary but should be obtainable by some means and describable using real 
numbers.
