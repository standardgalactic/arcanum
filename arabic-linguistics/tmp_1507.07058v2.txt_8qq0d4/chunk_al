Table 7:  Mean aesthetics scores and variations for the compositions generated (two domains). 
 
For Comp3.5, an ANOVA test across 5 sets, i.e. Comp3.5 on its own (2.438 mean aesthetics score, see Table 5) 
and Comp3.5 merged with the four other domains (see Table 7), showed a statistically significant difference 
between the means for their aesthetics scores: F (4, 372) = 2.69, p = 0.0031. This suggests that, given a high 
quality source (Comp3.5), using ‘information’ from other domains to compose chess problems does not result in 
higher quality compositions since the aesthetics scores using two domains were all lower. There was no 
difference of statistical significance for the average number of variations between the sets, which is the same 
outcome as the previous experiment. 
 
For Comp1.25, a similar ANOVA test showed no statistically significant difference between the means for their 
aesthetics scores or the average number of variations between the sets. This suggests that given a lower quality 
chess source (2.278 mean aesthetics score for Comp1.25 alone, see Table 5), using information from other 
domains neither negatively nor positively affects the quality of the generated compositions. For TG2500, 
however, the same ANOVA test showed a statistically significant difference between the means for their 
aesthetics scores: F (4, 327) = 3.48, p = 0.0084, but not for the variations. This suggests that using a high quality 
source of tournament game sequences (2.308 mean aesthetics score for TG2500 alone, see Table 5), the quality 
of the generated compositions can actually be improved slightly if used in combination with the Elvira or 
classical music sets. Yet the opposite is true if combined with the art and photo domains in this case. 
 
Finally, for TG1500, the ANOVA test showed a statistically significant difference between the means for their 
aesthetics scores: F (4, 504) = 2.39, p = 0.0497; and also for the variations: F (4, 504) = 2.51, p = 0.0412. This 
suggests that using a low quality set of tournament game sequences (2.278 mean aesthetics score for TG1500 
alone, see Table 5), the quality of the generated compositions can actually be improved if used in combination 
with any of the four other domains. In contrast with the result obtained for Comp1.25 above, the result also 
suggests that there is something ‘intrinsically’ different about compositions and tournament game sequences 
given that, in this case, their mean aesthetics scores using a single domain source were exactly the same (i.e. 
2.278). If, in principle, we can accept that compositions, even low quality ones, are generally better than low 

quality tournament game sequences, then the results so far would suggest that the lowest quality source domain 
(i.e. TG1500) used in combination with other domains actually produces among the best results. 
 
Even though the difference in the average number of variations in the case of TG1500 was also statistically 
significant, it is difficult to prove that having more or fewer variations (and what the thresholds really are) 
improves the quality of a composition. We can only say that the DSNS approach, in combining information 
from other domains with low quality tournament game sequences, is able to influence the average number of 
variations for the compositions generated both positively and negatively. Returning to the mean aesthetics 
scores, it is not clear why, exactly, the lowest quality chess source used in combination with all the other 
completely unrelated domains tested, through the DSNS approach, should produce compositions of higher 
quality than using the low quality chess source alone. It suggests that ‘unrelated’ information from different 
domains can indeed be aggregated meaningfully as is likely occurring in some form in the human brain. 
 
To test this further, we performed another comparison of three sets involving the TG1500 and photo domains. 
This is because the ‘TG1500 + photo’ combination (TG1500p for brevity) yielded the highest, statistically 
significant mean aesthetics score (2.449). We introduced a new source material set, i.e. ‘photorandom’. This is 
basically the same set of 300 photographs of people except that the values for each attribute were randomly-
generated within the range of highest and lowest for that attribute. So, for instance, if the ‘number of colors’ 
attribute for all 300 photos ranged from 927 to 238,034, then a ‘random’ photo would have a new value for that 
attribute based on a random number generated within that range. This was done for all 10 attributes. The result 
was a collection of ‘garbage’ photos where the attributes of each made no sense and probably did not exist in 
reality. 
 
It stands to reason that, if information is indeed being ‘successfully’ integrated or aggregated between unrelated 
domain types using the DSNS approach, actual photos (with real attribute values) should do better than those 
with randomly-generated attribute values (garbage photos) and also better than not using photos at all. So we 
compared the TG1500 (alone with no photo integration), the TG1500p and the TG1500 + photorandom 
(TG1500pr for brevity) sets together. The results are shown in Table 8.

Table 8:  Mean aesthetics scores and variations for the compositions generated (one and two domains). 
 
An ANOVA test showed a statistically significant difference between the means for their aesthetics scores: F (2, 
286) = 3.62, p = 0.0281; and also for the variations: F (2, 286) = 3.60, p = 0.0286. So it would seem that using 
actual photos (with real attributes) performs better than garbage photo data and also better than not using photos 
at all. Using actual photos also yields the highest number of variations, on average, of the three sets but that 
alone is not necessarily an improvement in terms of quality because we can see that the non-DSNS random 
approach in Table 5 also had a relatively high number of variations (35.5) but the lowest mean aesthetics score 
(2.208) compared to the other single domain chess sources. In summary, the DSNS approach, at least in the case 
of low quality tournament game sequences integrating information from real photographs, is able to produce 
compositions of higher aesthetic quality than otherwise. It remains an open question for now why this should 
happen at all, even though the human brain likely successfully mingles information from different domains in 
unusual and poorly-understood ways as well.

The Third Experiment: Variations in the Number of Objects and Attributes 
 
In the third experiment, we wanted to test if the number of objects used in the DSNS approach and the number 
of attributes influenced the quality of the compositions generated. For this purpose, we used the Comp3.5 and
