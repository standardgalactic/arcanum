Double solution: 1.c8=R! Ka3 2.Rc4 Ka2 3.Ra4#. Nice 
stalemate avoidance in the intention 2.Qc4?? 
In spite of the double solution, the stalemate 2.Qc4 would 
appeal much to humans, as it reminds the famous Barbieri-
Saavedra endgame. 
underpromotion to a rook would be more pretty... 2. Qg4 is 
not too unexpected 
 
43 
Double solution: 1.Rd6! Kf1 2.Rd2/Bf3 Ke1 3.Rd1#. Dual in 
the intention as well: 2.Rg6 Ke1 3.Rg1#. Bad key taking an 
unprovided flight. 
too obvious 
44 
Capturing key, creating a short threat. The defense is unique, 
but the continuation is rather dull. With wR placed on g4 and 
bPs a6, b7 and h4 removed, the key would have been 
improved. 
Black pawns a6 and b7 are seemingly useless. As stated in 
the commentary, the position could have been improved.
an obvious choice

Double solution: 1.Kh6! e3 2.Kg6/Ba2-f7[Bh2] e2 
3.Bd4[Be5]#. Similar duals in the intention: 2.Kh6/Ba2-f7. Bad 
key taking an unprovided flight. 
most obvious 
46 
Dual: 3.f8=R#. Flight taking key. The play could have been 
improved by adding a twin (e.g. Shift bK to h8 with the 
solution: 1.Be4 Kg8 2.Ke7 Kh8 3.f7#). 
there is only one possible #3 solution... and that is slightly 
surprising.. but fairly easy one to find 
47 
Double solutions: 1.Kb7/Kc7! Kb5 2.Bc2 Kb4 3.Qa4#. Duals 
in the intention: 2.Kb7/Kc7. Also dual after 2...Kb4 3.Qc5#. 
Key piece out of play in the initial position. 
nice to engage the queen in such geometry... there are 
however several alternative solutions 
48 
After a major promotion key taking a provided flight, the play 
is dualistic: 1...Sf8 
2.Qh5+/Qe1+/Qe4+/Qe7+/Rh2+/Qe3/Qe5/Qf7/Qb8/Qc8/Qxf8/. 
Same apply to other variations. 
so many alternatives on the 2nd move... 
49 
Major promotion key takes three flights. Duals in the main 
variation after 2...Ke5 3.Ra5# or 1...g3 2.Ra6+/Kd4/Ke4. Spoilt 
by duals in all variations. 
nice geometry... but certainly not the unique solution 
50 
Double solutions: 1.h8=R! ~ 2.Rg8+ Kh1 3.Rf1# and 1.Kg3! ~ 
2.h8=Q ~ 3.Qh2#. Duals in the intention: 2.Qg7+/Qxe5/Kg3. 
Bad key (major promotion) and several threats. 
most obvious 
51 
Promotion key takes a provided flight and introduces a short 
threat. Just one line, with no duals. 
unique, but too obvious solution 
52 
Give (e5) and take (c6, e6) key by an en prise piece. The rest is 
forced, in spite of what black moves. No duals. 
the mating net by the knight and bishop is nice... 
53 
Interversion of moves possible: 1.Rb4! Kc5 2.Rgb6 Kd5 
3.Ra5#. Double solution: 1.Ra4! Kc5 2.K any (or R waiting) 
Kd5 3.Rb5#. Dual in intention: 2.Ra4 Kd5 3.R2b5#. 
too elementary 
54 
Duals in the main variation: 1...Bb6 2.Qd5+/Qg5+/Qd7+ and 
2...Kb4 3.Ra4/Rc4#. Again major promotion key takes flight 
and threatens a short mate. 
diagonal checks on white squares vs. the opposite color 
bishop is a nice choice, but still fairly plain 
55 
Dual in the main variation: 3.Qb5#. The key played by en prise 
wQ threatens a short mate (2.Sc4#). The alternate black defense 
1...Se3 is dualistic: 2.Qc7+/Bd3+/Bd7+/Bf1+/Be2+/Bc4+. 
quite pretty 
relatively complex... although I wouldn't be too 
surprised if the computer composed this one (the 
absence of pawns reduce the complexity in the 
computational sense)
56 
Key takes black piece with major promotion. Dual 2.Qb1 after 
1...Kd2. Duals also after 1...Ke3 2.Qb2/Qd8 - not only 2.Qb3+. 
too obvious 

Not exciting play. 
57 
Flight taking key, capturing the only black officer and 
threatening two short mates. Dual after 1...Kh4 
2.Qg5+/Qxg6/Sf2. 
too obvious... e.g. a unique solution without capturing the 
knight (at least not on the first move) would be much 
prettier 
58 
Dual 2.Kc3 in the main variation. Bad key, taking three flights. 
Again this must be compared with Shinkman's cited at no 13. 
obvious
