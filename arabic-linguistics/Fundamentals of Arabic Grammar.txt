Fundamentals of  Arabic Grammar provides an authoritative guide to Modern Standard 
Arabic (MSA) grammar. It has been organised to promote a thorough understanding 
of MSA grammar and presents its complexities in a cohesive and user-friendly format, 
filling many gaps left by other textbooks. Explanations are clear, full and accessible 
and extensive cross-referencing, two generous indexes and six appendices provide users 
with easy access to the information they require. No prior knowledge of linguistic 
terminology is required.
Features include:
•
Expert treatment of a full range of grammar topics and structures, including the 
case system, IDhaafa, the equational sentence, quantifiers and the vocative, gener-
ously spread across thirty-eight chapters
•
Special attention to parts of speech, such as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs and 
prepositions, given at the beginning of the book to acquaint students with the basic 
units of Arabic and provide a solid foundation for further learning
•
A wide range of contemporary examples drawn from real life to provide a solid 
context for grammar points, further supported by word glosses and idiomatic 
translations of sentences
•
Grammatical terms given in both Arabic and English
•
A wide variety of supplementary learning resources such as practice sheets, exer-
cises and verb tables available to download free at http://www.routledge.com/
books/details/9780415710046/
•
A substantial bibliography incorporating primary Arabic grammar sources in  
addition to secondary sources in Arabic and in English.
Fundamentals of  Arabic Grammar has been field tested over a number of years and has 
been written by a highly experienced teacher of Arabic. It will be an essential resource 
for students and teachers of Arabic at all university levels and is suitable for use both 
as a companion reference text in Arabic language courses and as a standalone text in 
independent grammar classes.

I have observed that no one finishes the writing of a book who does not say afterwards: had 
this change been made, the book would have been better; had this item been added the book 
would have been better appreciated; had this item been moved forward the book would have been 
more beautiful. In this lies the most important lesson: it is proof of the inherent imperfection 
of all humans.

Introduction
The rise of the grammatical tradition among Arabs is tied closely to the rise 
of Islam and its holy book, the Qur’an. This book became a subject of study and 
linguistic analysis in the seventh century A.D. This is no different to the develop
ment of grammars of other nations that was stimulated by religious or other 
major works: the Vedas gave rise to the grammar of Sanskrit, Homer to the Greek 
grammar, the Biblical canons to Hebrew and the book of Confucius to Chinese.
The first book on Arabic grammar, al-Kitaab, was authored by Sibawayhi 
in the eighth century. Since then, many schools of Arabic grammar have devel
oped, with various competing regional and intellectual paradigms resulting in 
a great number of books from various perspectives and for different purposes. 
Through such works, the Arabic language has been minutely and painstakingly 
analyzed and set out in countless descriptions by eminent scholars writing in 
Arabic as well as in major Eastern and Western languages.
This work is not intended to add one more book to the distinguished list 
of classics on the subject. Rather, it is intended for a special audience: students 
learning Arabic as a foreign language at university level. One of its major goals 
is to present the fundamentals of Arabic grammar to those in the process of 
acquiring the language in an easy-to-read format.
This material consists of topics essential to the mastery of Arabic as a 
foreign language, both orally and in its written form. It treats the grammatical 
issues integral to language learning at university level, both undergraduate as 
well as graduate. Various grammar details and innumerable complex exceptions 
to rules, endemic to classic Arabic grammar books and university-level gram-
mar courses in Arab universities, were deliberately left out.
The first eight chapters cover the basic building blocks of language in a 
manner learners untrained in grammar in their high schools can find accessible. 

Introdu t on
xxiii
These chapters present a general overview of how those elements interface with 
each other to form a system of communication, both orally and in writing, to 
foster accuracy in the linguistic output, the means of communication in a 
speech community. Fundamentals of  Arabic Grammar, henceforth Fundamentals, 
presumes its users to have mastered the Arabic writing system, the names of 
letters of the alphabet and the sounds they represent. This is normally expected 
by the end of the first four weeks of the first semester of an introductory Arabic 
language course in any serious university program. That is why all examples 
are given in the Arabic orthography, and references are made to the Arabic 
names of the letters and basic notions such as tanwiin.
Fundamentals is not intended to replace instructional textbooks. It is intended 
to supplement and to reinforce them; to function as a resource book, a refer-
ence tool providing a holistic presentation of grammar rather than the disjointed 
approach often encountered in textbooks available on the market nowadays.
The arrangement of chapters attempts to relate relevant items to one  
another. Materials specific to nouns, their cases, derivation, numbers, etc., for 
example, are sequentially ordered in the interest of providing a comprehensive 
treatment of nouns. The same is to be said about verbs, their types, behaviors, 
tenses, and moods, etc. Instructors can enjoy leeway in determining which 
chapters, or sections of chapters, are essential to their students’ immediate 
needs. They, therefore, can order the presentation of materials to their students 
according to the learners’ levels, curricular requirements in a specific week, or 
their program priorities. The chapter on verbs, for example, is too detailed to 
present to a beginning-level class in one sitting. The assignment of such a 
chapter could be spread over a number of sessions, as need dictates. Similarly, 
to treat the grammar of numbers adequately instructors may choose to divide 
this topic for different presentations on different days.
Fundamentals is well suited for an independent grammar course at university 
level. Indeed, its origin lay in just such a course. In this case, it plays a different 
role. As a course textbook, it can serve as a desk reference for both the student and 
instructor and will enable them to clarify points of grammar in an organized 
fashion.
The pages of this work contain a large number of tables of verb conjugation 
spread out in the various chapters dealing with verbs, their tenses and moods. 
In addition, there are several supplementary tables, placed on the web, to which 
learners can refer to ensure mastery of the verb system and other derivations.

Learning the grammar contained in the pages of this book is supported by 
the accompanying exercises placed on the web. These exercises are intended 
for in-class practice as well as for homework assignments. Language learning 
is not different from any skill that can be mastered through practice only. As 
the saying goes, “practice makes perfect.”
The Arabic introduced in this book is often referred to as Modern Standard 
Arabic (MSA), or Modern Literary Arabic (MLA), the language variety used 
in formal settings across the Arabic-speaking regions, both in print and, increas-
ingly, in electronic media, especially in the last few decades. The Arabic term 
fuS-Ha, “refined, pure,” is often employed in reference to this linguistic variety. 
Thus, the examples used in these pages to illustrate certain grammar points 
mirror those utterances delivered in formal settings by literate, educated native 
speakers, orally or in writing. Due to historical and other reasons, educated 
native speakers of MSA have not represented a majority in their societies. Their 
numbers, however, are increasing due to many factors: the spread of education, 
rising literacy levels, and the recent introduction of pan-Arab electronic media 
venues that employ the linguistic variety contained in this work.
Examples are provided only in the Arabic script with full vocalization, 
except for proper nouns where case markers have been left out. Some grammar 
books provide phonetic transcription of example sentences. This book deliber-
ately avoids this practice in order to encourage learners to access the language 
in its own writing system. Word glosses and idiomatic translations of sentences 
are also provided.
Latinate nomenclature may not always be adequate to characterize the 
Arabic linguistic phenomena under discussion. There is a deliberate effort on 
our side to introduce Arabic grammar terminology, often side by side with 
commonly used Western terminology. Instead of using the designation “as-
similative verbs” used by Western sources, for example, the term waaw-beginning 
verbs is employed, named after the letter waaw––a term favored by Arab gram-
marians, and more descriptive in the classification of those verbs. The linguis-
tically savvy learner will find the Arabic labels more accurate than the Latinate 
ones, which are conventionally imposed from outside the language tradition to 
describe grammar categories belonging to a different language tradition and 
family.
To study Arabic grammar is to participate in Arab culture. In addition to 
facilitating precise communication in Arabic, the study of grammar opens doors 

Introdu t on

to cultural production like theology, literature, songs, and even humor. Many 
a fine point turns on grammar, and in these Arabic speakers have always found 
much to enjoy and debate. It is hoped that students will learn to appreciate 
Arabic grammar as much as they do the music, food and other aspects of Arab 
culture.

Verbs are that part of speech that express action or the occurrence of an event. 
Verbs are usually the first element in MSA sentences that contain verbs, followed 
by performers of actions, called  فاعِلin Arabic. A sentence whose initial ele-
ment is a verb is known as a verbal sentence. A sentence beginning with a noun 
is called a nominal sentence. There are grammatical consequences for the choice 
of placing the verb or the performer of action at the head of the sentence. 
Examples of verbal and nominal sentences follow:
. ِوَصَ لَ الصَّ ديقُ أَمْسThe friend (M) arrived yesterday.
. ِالصَّ ديقَةُ وَصَ لَت أَمْسThe friend (F) arrived yesterday.
1.1 The performer of ac ion فاعِل
All verbs have a  ,فاعِلthe performer of action. This element could be expressed 
as a noun, or nouns, or as a pronoun, explicit or implied. An expressed noun 
functioning as a performer is always in the nominative case; it can be definite 
or indefinite. Definite singular nouns must end with a Dhamma in the writing 
system of formal Arabic, pronounced -u; indefinite singular nouns end with 
two Dhammas in orthography, pronounced -un. Dual definite and indefinite 
nouns such as  فاعِلmust have ِان- at their ends; regular masculine plural nouns 
have َون-; irregular plural nouns, like singular nouns, have either a Dhamma or 
two, depending on their determination (whether they are definite or indefinite). 
Finally, regular feminine plural nouns must have ات - with either a Dhamma or 
two, depending on their determination.
1.2 Verb enses
Verbs can convey a sense of time frame: past, present, or future; whether the 
action happened in the past or was a single occurrence, or if one action  
T

happened before or after another, whether it happens regularly and habitually, 
or is happening at the present time, or whether it will happen at some future 
time. These time references of events expressed by verbs are called tenses. Verb 
tenses in Arabic are divided into the following:
1.
Past tense is used to express a past, completed action (see Chapter 11), or 
an action which was ongoing in the past (see Chapter 18 on past continuous 
tense), or two actions which happened in the past with one action occurring 
before the other (see past perfect tense, Chapter 19).
2.
Present tense is used to express actions in the present, either happening 
habitually or regularly, or to state a fact. Additionally, this tense can be 
used to express the future (see Chapter 14). Forms of the present tense are 
also used in imperatives and their negatives, and follow subjunctive particles.
3.
Future tense employs verbs to express action that will happen at some point 
in the future (see Chapter 14).

1.3.1 Intransitive verbs ُاألَفْعالُ الالزِمَة
Some verbs require only a performer of action, the  ,فاعِلto make a complete 
sentence. For example, the verbs َ“ نامhe slept, to sleep” or َ“ اِبْتَسَ مhe smiled, 
to smile” express actions that are unilaterally performed by one person, namely 
the person who slept or smiled. Such verbs are referred to as intransitive verbs 
( / فِعل الزمPl  ,)أَفعال الزِمَةverbs that do not require direct objects as in َ ُر“ كَبto 
become bigger,” َ“ ضَ حِ كto laugh.” Intransitive verbs are often used with prep-
ositions which are learned as part and parcel of learning the verb itself and 
how it is used. Examples of intransitive verbs include: “ ذَهَبَ إىلto go to,” َ رَجَ ع
“ مِنْ / إِىلto return from/to,” ْ“ خَ رَجَ مِنto go out, exit,” etc.
1.3.2 Transitive verbs األفْعالُ الـمُ تَعَدِّيَة
Some verbs express actions by a performer that extends explicitly or implicitly 
to something or someone else. Such verbs are called transitive verbs (ٍّ فِعل مُتَعَد
 /Pl  .)أَفعال مُتَعَدِّيَةA transitive verb not only has a  ,فاعِلperformer, but can

take what is referred to as ِ ,مَفْعولٌ  بِهa direct object. Examples of transitive  
verbs include َ“ دَرَسto study,” َ“ كَتَبto write,” َ“ فَهِمto understand,” َِبَر“ شto 
drink,” etc. If the direct object is not mentioned, the speaker/writer is using  
a stylistic strategy called truncation and is leaving it to the listener/reader to fill 
it in. A limited number of verbs take two direct objects. Examples of such 
verbs include: “ أعْطىto give,” َ َّن“ عَيto appoint,” َ“ اِنْتَخَ بto elect, select.” Consider 
the following examples:
.ًأَعْطَ ى الرَّجُ لُ الوَلَدَ ديناراThe man gave the boy a dinar.
.ًَ الرَّئيسُ األُستاذَ وزيراَّنعَيThe president appointed the professor  
as a minister.
1.4 
ouns as direc  objec s
Direct objects are always in the accusative case ( ;)مَنْصوبthey can be definite 
or indefinite (see Chapter 3 on cases). Singular, definite nouns functioning as 
direct objects must end with a fat-Ha in formal spoken or scripted Arabic. On 
the other hand, if the direct object is indefinite masculine, it must end with an 
’alif bearing two fat-Has ً( اtanwiin) in the orthography. Masculine, indefinite 
nouns as direct objects ending with hamza do not take this ’alif-bearing two 
fat-Has, as in, for example, ً“ سَ امءsky,” ً“ ماءwater,” ً“ هواءair,” etc. Feminine 
nouns functioning as direct objects end with two fat-Has placed above the 
feminine marker, the taa’ marbuuTa ً .ةConsider the following:
.ًالطالِبَةُ قَرَأَت كِتاباThe student (F) read a book.
.ًِبَ قَهْوَةَرحُ سَ ي شHussein drank coffee.
Dual masculine or feminine nouns must end with َِ يْن- when functioning as 
direct objects, as in the following examples:
.ِ ْنقابلوا مُوَظَّ فَيThey met two employees.
.ِ ْندعَوْنا صَ ديقَتَيWe invited two friends (F).
Regular masculine nouns end with َين-; irregular plural nouns as objects behave 
largely like singular nouns with respect to their accusative case endings; definite 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

feminine regular plural nouns must have a kasra instead of fat-Ha or two fat-Has 
if they are indefinite. Consider the following examples:
.َِكَةُ مُهَنْدِسنيَّروَظَّ فَتِ الشThe company employed engineers (M).
. ٍقابَلَتِ املُديرَةُ مُدَرِّساتThe director met teachers (F, Pl).
1.5 
ronouns as direc  objec s
If the direct object is a pronoun, this pronoun assumes a cliticized, shortened 
form that must attach to the end of the verb as a suffix (see Chapter 5 on 
pronouns). The direct object pronoun cannot stand independently and is under
stood to be in the accusative case. Consider the following:
. ِاألبُ قابَلَنا أَمْسThe father met us yesterday.
ا يف املَكْ تَبَةِ؟َههَلْ شاهَدْتDid you see her in the library?
.ِعَرَفْتُهُم أَثْناءَ الدِّراسَ ةِ يف اجلامِعَةI knew them during the [my] university  
study.
1.6 Gender
Verbs are inflected to first, second and third pronouns. They must reflect the 
gender of the  فاعِلfor the second َ“ أَنْتyou (M),” ِ“ أَنْتyou (F),” their dual 
and plural forms (see Chapter 5 on pronouns) and third person pronouns َ هُ و
“he,” َ“ هِيshe,” and their dual and plural forms. The first person pronouns  
“ أناI” and ُ“ نَحْ نwe” do not have gender markings in verb inflection/ 
conjugation. If the  فاعِلis a feminine noun, it is marked by suffixing ت-, as in 
the following:
.َالطّ الِبَةُ أَكَلَتِ اخلُبْزThe student (F) ate the bread.
.َأَكَلَتِ الطّ الِبَةُ اخلُبْزThe student (F) ate the bread.
Because verbs are specific to gender, person and number (below), no pronoun 
is necessary to represent the  .فاعِلIf a pronoun is used, it simply adds  
emphasis.

The verb system in Arabic

1.7 
umber in Verbs
Singular nouns such as  فاعِلare used with singular verbs. If, however, the  فاعِل
is a dual or plural noun placed before the verb, as in nominal sentences, the  
verb must reflect the number of the noun. (This matter is treated in detail in 
Chapter 11.) The following examples are illustrative:
.َِبَ املُعَلِّمونَ القَهْوَةَرشThe teachers drank coffee.
.َِبوا القَهْوَةَراملُعَلّمونَ شThe teachers drank coffee.
1.8 Verb 
oice
1.8.1 The active voice
All verb tenses, past, present and future, discussed thus far are in the active 
voice. This means that the identity of the performer of the action, i.e. the  ,فاعِل
is known to interlocutors; it is easily identifiable by the presence of the noun 
indicating who carried out the action, as in the following examples:
. ََ الطالِبُ الزُّجاجَركَسThe student broke the glass.
.ٍيَكُ تُبُ الصُّ حُ فِيُّ مَقالَةً كُلَّ أُسْ بوعThe journalist writes an article every week.
1.8.2 The passive voice
In cases when the performer is not identified or is unknown, the verb is rendered 
in the passive voice. Passive verbs in Arabic in all tenses undergo internal vowel 
change(s) from the active. The two examples in the active voice above are 
rendered in the passive voice as follows:
. َُ الزُّجاجِركُسThe glass was broken.
.ٍتُكْ تَبُ مَقالَةٌ كُلَّ أُسْ بوعAn article is written every week.
Note that the performers of actions in these sentences are not identified, and 
that the accusative direct objects َ“ الزُّجاجthe glass,” and ً“ مَقالَةessay, an article,” 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
6
in the active voice sentences changed their cases to the nominative. Accusative 
direct objects changing to the nominative case are labeled as  نائِب  الفاعِل
“performer deputy” in Arabic grammar. Note that the verb ُ“ يَكْ تُبhe writes” in 
the second sentence changes gender into the feminine to agree with the femin
ine noun “ مَقالةessay, article” when it becomes the  فاعِلof the passive verb.
In addition to obscuring the identity of the performer in the preceding 
examples, the passive voice is sometimes used for stylistic variation, especially 
in writing (see Chapter 16 for detailed discussion).
1.9 Verb forms or pa
erns  وَزْنor صيغة
Arab grammarians describe Arabic verbs by using a standard verb, the verb 
َ“ فَعَلto do,” and rendering it into various forms or patterns with prefixes and 
infixes to describe how a particular verb fits into the general patterning of 
Arabic verbs. It is a device similar to how X, Y, and Z serve as templates for 
algebraic expressions. The three consonants of the verb َ فَعَلstand for the three 
consonants that comprise the root of most Arabic verbs. These tri-consonantal 
verbs are called ّ / فِعْل ثُالثِيPl  .أَفْعال ثُالثِيَّةThe  فrepresents the first consonant, 
 عrepresents the second consonant, and  لrepresents the third consonant. Thus, 
from the three consonants  ر، دand  سwe obtain the verb َ“ دَرَسhe studied, to 
study”; it is in the َ فَعَلform, Form I. When the middle consonant is doubled 
phonetically (written with a shadda in the orthography), we obtain َ .دَرَّسThis 
verb is said to be in the َ فَعَّلform, Form II; the newly formed verb means  
“he taught.” Western writers on Arabic grammar refer to verb categories by 
the use of Roman numerals. A verb consisting of three consonants is referred 
to as a Form I verb. Other verb forms are assigned different Roman numerals, 
as we shall see below.
1.9.1 Form I verbs َصيغَة فَعَل
Verbs in the past tense in َ فَعَلform express the third person singular  
pronoun َ .هُ وThey always end in fat-Ha. The middle vowel may be a fat-Ha as 
in ُ“ كَتَبَ  /  يَكْ تُبhe wrote,” or a kasra as in ُ“ لَعِبَ  /  يَلْعَبhe played,” or a 
Dhamma as in ُ ُرَ / يَكْ بُر“ كَبhe grew up.” Schooled native speakers memorize 
their verb patterns and internalize this information. Foreign learners are expected 
to do the same.

The verb system in Arabic
7
Tri-consonantal َ فَعَلverbs can be intransitive and transitive verbs (see above). 
َ فَعَلverbs (Form I) are generally viewed to have several subcategories, presented 
below under their respective titles:
1.9.1.1 waaw-beginning verbs اَألَفْعال الواوِيَّة
 فَعَلَverbs include a list of verbs that begin with a waaw in the past tense, known 
as  ,أَفْعال الـمِثالor “ أَفْعال واوِيَّةwaaw-beginning verbs.” The middle vowel in 
the past tense varies. Some of these verbs are intransitive, others are transitive. 
In the present tense, the waaw for the third person singular pronoun َ“ هُ وhe” 
changes to yaa’, as we shall see in Chapter 12. Following are intransitive verbs 
in this category: َ“ وَجَ بto become necessary, to be incumbent,” ُ وَصَ لَ / يَصِ ل
“to arrive at, reach,” ُ“ وَقَفَ / يَقِفto stand up, to stop.” Transitive verbs in this 
category include ُِدَج“ وَجَ دَ / يto find, to locate,” ُ“ وَصَ فَ / يَصِ فto describe,” 
and ُِبَه“ وَهَبَ / يto grant.”
1.9.1.2 yaa’-beginning verbs اَألَفْعالُ اليائِيَّة
 فَعَلَverbs include a list of verbs that begin with a yaa’ in the past tense, known 
as “ أَفْعال يائِيَّةyaa’-beginning verbs.” These verbs tend to be intransitive, and 
their use is rather infrequent. Examples include ُ“ يَئِسَ / يَيْأَسto despair, to lose 
hope,” ُ“ يَبِسَ / يَيْبَسto be/become dry.”
1.9.1.3 Hollow verbs اَألفْعال اجلَوْفاء
Hollow verbs in the past tense consist of two consonants separated by an ’alif  
 اas in ُ“ نامَ / يَنامto sleep,” ُ“ قالَ / يَقولto say,” etc. They have roots that are 
either waaw or yaa’.
1.9.1.4 Defective verbs (األفْعال الـمُ عْتَلَّة اآلخِ ر (األَفْعال النّاقِصَ ة
Defective verbs  األَفْعال الـمُ عْتَلَّة اآلخِ رor  األفْعال النّاقِصَ ةin the past tense end with 
either ’alif  maqSuura or ’alif. Examples of verbs ending with ’alif  maqSuura are 
“ بَنى / يَبْنيto build,” and “ رَمى / يَرْميto throw, to toss.” Examples of verbs 
ending with regular ’alif include “ عَال / يَعْلوto go up, to rise,” and  سام / يَسْ مو
“to become sublime.”

1.9.1.5 Doubled verbs اَألفْعال الـمُ ضَ عَّفَة
The last sub-category of َ فَعَلverbs is a group of verbs that have a final doubled, 
geminated consonant, as in ُّ“ عَدَّ / يَعُدto count, to consider,” ُّ“ مَرَّ / يَمُ رto pass 
through,” and so on.
1.9.1.6 Verbs of beginning وعُّرأَفعال الش
This is a group of verbs denoting the onset of an action. Such verbs must be 
followed by a noun forming an equational sentence whose predicate must be 
an indicative present tense verb. For that reason, Arab grammarians consider 
verbs of beginning members of َ كانand its sisters (see Chapter 10) . This structure 
is used to indicate actions that happened in the past. All these verbs have the 
meaning of “[he] began, started, initiated.” Such a finite list of verbs includes 
the following examples: ُ[“ أَخَ ذَ / يَأْخُ ذhe] took it upon himself,” ُ“ بَدَأَ / يَبْدَأhe 
began,” َُعْرَ عَ / يَشَر“ شhe started,” etc.
These verbs are generally followed by verbs in the present tense to express 
the notion that someone initiated an action. Note that the forms of verbs of 
beginning themselves are in the past tense; however, the verb following them 
must be in the present tense. Examine the following illustrative examples:
.أَخَ ذَ يَدْرُسُ عِنْدَما شاهَدَينHe started to study when he saw me.
.ِهَبَّ يُدافِعُ عَن هذِهِ القَضِ يَّةHe rushed to defend this matter.
.َِ عَ يَتَكَ لَّمُ عَنْ آرائِهِ السِّ ياسِ يَّةَرشHe began talking about his political views.
.ٍصارَ يَصيحُ بِصَ وْتٍ عالHe started shouting in a loud voice.
.ِأَخَ ذَ يَتَكَ لَّمُ عَنِ السِّ ياسَ ةHe began talking about politics.
.ِبَدَأَ يَكْ تُبُ مُذَكِّراتِهHe started writing his memoirs.
1.9.2 Augmented verbs ( األَفْعال الـمَزيدَةForms II–X)
The َ فَعَلform can be manipulated by prefixes and/or infixes, or a combination 
of these to create other verb categories. These elements are represented in the 
orthography and include doubling of a consonant in the middle or end of a 
verb (Form II), as was mentioned previously. In addition, there are the long 

The verb system in Arabic
9
vowel aa represented by ’alif in the orthography (Form III); a hamza written on 
an ’alif  (Form IV); a taa’ prefixed to Form II verbs (Form V); or a combination 
of taa’ as a prefix and ’alif as an infix (Form VI); or a combination of ’alif and 
nuun as a prefix (Form VII); or ’alif as prefix and taa’ as infix (Form VIII); an 
’alif and doubling of the final consonant (Form IX); and, finally, َ اِسْ تـas prefix 
(Form X). Discussion of the various verb categories follows.
1.9.2.1 Form II verbs َصيغَة فَعَّل
This verb form is derived from َ فَعَلverbs by doubling the middle consonant. 
In the Arabic orthography, this is represented by writing the shadda followed 
by a fat-Ha above the middle consonant. This doubling of the middle consonant 
results in new verbs with new special meanings. Since َ فَعَّلform verbs are derived 
from َ فَعَلverbs, a semantic link between the original form and the augmented 
one may exist. For example, ُ دَرَسَ / يَدْرُسmeans “to study.” ُ ,دَرَّسَ / يُدَرِّسon 
the other hand, means “to make someone study” or “to cause someone to 
study.” َ دَرَّسis, therefore, used in the sense of “to teach.” Verbs in this category 
tend to be transitive, i.e. they require a direct object.
Some َ فَعَّلform verbs indicate a level of intensity added to the original  
meaning of َ فَعَلforms. For example, ُ ِّرَ / يُكَ سَّر كَسis augmented from ُ ِرَ / يَكْ سَر كَس
“to break.” It conveys the meaning of “to break in an intensive fashion,” i.e., 
“to smash.”
1.9.2.2 Form III verbs َصيغَة فاعَل
This verb form is derived from the َ فَعَلform by phonetically elongating the 
fat-Ha sound; in the orthography by inserting an ’alif  اafter the first consonant, 
resulting in َ .فاعَلSome verbs in this category can be transitive, others intransitive. 
Intransitive verbs require a preposition. Many instances of  فاعَلforms indicate 
reciprocity or mutuality and have a semantic relationship to َ فَعَلverb forms. 
This relationship, however, is sometimes tenuous. Examine the following  
examples:
. َساعَدَ املُدَرِّسُ الطالِبThe instructor helped the student.
.َقابَلَ املُديرُ الطَّ بيبَةThe director met with the physician.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
10
1.9.2.3 Form IV verbs َصيغَة أَفْعَل
Verbs in this form are derived by the prefixation of a hamza at the beginning 
of the َ فَعَلform. In the orthography, the hamza at the beginning of a word 
must always have a “seat” in the form of an ’alif; such augmentation results 
in change in the vowel pattern. Notice in this form that the first consonant is 
not followed by a vowel; a sukuun is provided in the orthography. Many verbs in 
this category are transitive, others intransitive. In many instances َ أَفْعَلforms 
have a causal semantic relationship to َ فَعَلverb forms. This relationship, however, 
is sometimes tenuous. Examine the following examples:
.ِ َرعَلِمَ باخلَبHe knew of the news [item].
.ِ َرأَعْلَمَ صَ ديقَهُ باخلَبHe informed his friend of the news [item].
. َفَهِمَ السُّ ؤالHe understood the question.
. َأَفْهَمَني السُّ ؤالHe explained the question to me.
1.9.2.4 Form V verbs َصيغة تَفَعَّل
This form is obtained by the prefixation of the  تto َ فَعَّلForm II verbs. Whereas 
Form II has a causative effect, the addition of taa’ at the beginning contributes 
to make  تَفَعَّلForm V reflexive, as in َ“ قَطَّ عto cut intensively,” َ“ تَقَطَّ عto be cut.” 
In addition, Form V also conveys a sense of intensity. For example, َقَر اِفْتmeans 
“to separate,” and َ تَفَرَّقconveys the meaning of “disperse.” Examine the  
following examples:
.ِتَفَرَّقَ املُتظاهِرونَ يف شَ وارِعِ املَدينةThe demonstrators dispersed in the  
streets of the city.
.ُ عَنْ سورياِرتَكَ لَّمَ املُحاضThe lecturer spoke about Syria.
.َرَضِ اِبْنِهاِلم ُّتَأَلـَّمَتِ األُمThe mother felt pain due to her  
son’s illness.
1.9.2.5 Form VI verbs َصيغَة تَفاعَل
This form is derived by the prefixation of taa’ to the َ فاعَلform, thus resulting 
in َ—تَفاعَلa form that conveys the sense of reciprocity or mutuality. َ فاعَلverb 

The verb system in Arabic
11
forms and those of َ تَفاعَلshare features of the same meaning. The difference 
between these two categories, however, is in their syntax. Whereas َ فاعَلforms 
often tend to have a direct object, َ تَفاعَلverbs, on the other hand, often require 
the use of a preposition, most commonly َ.مَع
تَساعَدَ مَعَ الطُّ الّبِ .He and the students cooperated.
.ِتَقابَلَ مَعَ الزُّوّارHe met with the visitors.
1.9.2.6 Form VII verbs َصيغَة اِنْفَعَل
This form is derived from َ فَعَلverb forms by the prefixation of ْ اِنـto َ فَعَلverbs. 
In general, this verb form expresses a reflexive or passive meaning, i.e. some-
thing that happens to the entity, a person or a thing, from within itself, without 
external agents. For example, َ َر“ كَسto break,” requires an agent to effect  
the action. On the other hand,  اِنْكَ سexpresses that the thing broke by itself; 
it was not broken by an outside agent. All َ اِنْفَعَلform verbs are intransitive; 
some in this category require the use of a preposition, usually ْ“ مِنfrom,”  إِىل
“to,” or َمَع“with,” but other prepositions are also possible.
.ِاِنْسَ حَ بَ مِنَ االِجْ تِامعHe withdrew from the meeting.
. َُ الزُّجاجَراِنْكَ سThe glass broke.
1.9.2.7 Form VIII verbs َصيغَة اِفْتَعَل
This verb form is derived by two processes: the use of hamza as a prefix (in the 
orthography it is written as an ’alif with a kasra underneath it), and the insertion 
of a taa’ after the first consonant of َ فَعَلverbs. The first consonant is not followed 
by a vowel. This explains why in the orthography the sukuun is written above the 
first organic consonant of the verb. From the verb ُ“ سَ مِعَ / يَسْ مَعto hear,” we obtain 
ُ“ اِسْ تَمَعَ / يَسْ تَمِعto listen.” Some of the verbs in this pattern are transitive, requir-
ing direct objects; others are intransitive and require the use of prepositions.
The inserted taa’ in this pattern undergoes changes in the environment of 
voiced and/or emphatic sounds. Thus, in the verb ُ“ زَحَ مَ / يَزْحَ مto crowd, to 
push,” the taa’ changes to its voiced counterpart, namely daal. Instead of the 
expected ََمَح اِزْتthe actual verb in use is ُ“ اِزْدَحَ مَ / يَزْدَحِ مto become crowded.” 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
12
Similarly, in the verb ُ“ زَهَرَ / يُزْهِرto bloom, flourish” the taa’ is assimilated by 
the voiced consonant  زand changes to daal, thus creating the verb ُ اِزْدَهَرَ / يَزْدَهِر
“to flourish, prosper.”
If dhaal is the first letter/sound of the tri-consonantal verb, the inserted taa’ 
is assimilated by this first letter. From َ“ ذَخَ رto keep, preserve” we obtain َ اِدَّخَ ر
“to save, preserve, amass, hoard.”
If the first letter/sound of the َ فَعَلForm I verb is either  صor  ضthe inserted 
 تchanges into  .طSimilarly, if the first letter/sound of the َ فَعَلForm I verb 
is  طthe inserted  تchanges to  ;طif the first letter/sound is  ظthe inserted  ت
changes to  ,ظas the following examples illustrate:
From َ ,صَ لَحone of whose meanings is “to be useful,” we obtain َ اِصْ طَ لَح
“to accept, to adopt”; from َ“ صادto catch, to trap,” we obtain َ“ اِصْ طادto catch,  
to hunt.” From َ“ ضَ جَ عto sleep, recline,” we obtain the verb َ“ اِضْ طَ جَ عto recline, 
to sleep, to lie down”; from ََ بَر“ ضto hit,” we obtain َ“ اِضْ طَ رَبto be in a state of 
turmoil, to agitate.” From َ“ طَ لَعto appear, to rise, to become visible,” we obtain 
َ“ اِطَّ لَعto behold a view”; from َ“ ظَ لَمto do injustice to someone,” we obtain َ اِظَّ لَم
“to suffer injustice, to be wronged.”
Consider the following examples:
.َِتِ الشَّ وارِعُ بالزُّوّارَماِزْدَحThe streets were crowded with tourists.
.ِاِزْدَهَرَ اِقْتِصادُ البِالدThe country’s economy flourished.
.ًاِصْ طادَ الصّ يّادُ سَ مَكَ ةً كَبريَةThe fisher caught a big fish.
.ًاِدَّخَ رَ املُسْ تَثْمِرُ أَمْواالً كَثريَةThe investor amassed huge amounts  
of money.
. ِاِضْ طَ رَبَتِ األَسواقُ املالِيَّةُ أَثْناءَ احلَرْبThe stock markets were in a state of  
turmoil during the war.
In waaw-beginning verbs the waaw is assimilated by the inserted taa’. From 
Form I verb َ“ وَصَ لto arrive at,” we obtain َ“ اِتَّصَ لto contact, communicate 
with,” of Form VIII. Similarly, from َ“ أَخَ ذto take,” the Form VIII verb is ََذَّخ اِت
“to take up, to take on, to adopt.” Examine the following:
.َد مِن دِمَشْ قْماِتَّصَ لَ يب صَ ديقي أحMy friend Ahmad contacted me from  
Damascus.
.َِذَ سامي رَأْيَ أبيهَّخاِتSami adopted his father’s opinion.

The verb system in Arabic

1.9.2.8 Form IX verbs َّصيغَة اِفْعَل
This verb form is obtained by the use of hamza as a prefix to the َ فَعَلform (in 
the orthography it is written as an ’alif with a kasra underneath it) and the 
doubling of the final consonant, represented in the writing system by a shadda. 
Note that the first consonant is not followed by a vowel. َّ افْعَلverbs tend to 
designate physical defects or change of color. For example, the triconsonantal 
verb ُ عَرَجَ / يَعْرُجpertains to limping or lameness. Thus, the verb ُّ اِعْرَجَّ / يَعْرَج
is used to express the condition of someone who has become lame.
َّ افْعَلhowever is used more frequently to express a change of color. These verbs 
are always intransitive. From the adjective َرْم“ أَحred,” we obtain ُّْمَرَحَرَّ / يْم“ اِحto 
become red, to change color into red,” as in the following example:
.َُرَّتِ السَّ امءْماِحThe sky turned red.
1.9.2.9 Form X verbs َصيغَة اِسْ تَفْعَل
This form is derived by the prefixation of َ اِسْ تـto َ فَعَلverbs. Note the change 
in the vowel pattern, namely the dropping of the fat-Ha after the first consonant 
of َ فَعَلverbs. Thus, from ُ“ عَلِمَ / يَعْلَمto know,” we derive ُ“ اِسْ تَعْلَمَ / يَسْ تَعْلِمto 
inquire.” In this example, a connection in meaning between َ عَلِمand َ اِسْ تَعْلَم
can be discerned. In other words, َ“ اِسْ تَعْلَمto inquire,” has something to do 
with wanting to know. The relationship in meaning between the َ فَعَلverb form 
and its derived counterpart َ اسْ تَفْعَلmay not always obtain. Some verbs in this  
category are transitive, requiring a direct object; others are intransitive and 
require the use of prepositions.
.َاِسْ تَقْبَلَتِ العائِلَةُ االزّائِرThe family received the visitor.
. َِ الطَّ بيبُ عَنِ املَريضَراِسْ تَفْسThe doctor inquired about the patient.
1.9.3 Quadriliteral verbs
A group of verbs in Arabic consist of four consonants, hence the name  
“ األَفعال الرُّباعِيَّةquadriliteral verbs.” Examples of such include َْجِ مُ /  تَرجَ مَر يُت
“to translate,” َ“ يُسَ يْطِرُ/  سَ يْطَ رto control,” ََنْدِسُ  /  هَنْدَسُه“ يto engineer,” and  
َ“ يُطَ مْئِنُ / طَ مْأَنto assure, to calm someone down.”

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
14
A common form of quadriliteral verbs is what is referred to as duplicatives. 
These are verbs in which the same syllable is duplicated, often expressing move
ment or sound. Such verbs include َ“ يُوَسْ وِسُ / وَسْ وَسto whisper,” َ يُزَلْزِلُ / زَلْزَل
“to shake,” َ“ يُبَلْبِلُ  /  بَلْبَلto confound, confuse,” َ“ يُعَشْ عِشُ  /  عَشْ عَشto nest,” 
َ“ يُقَلْقِلُ / قَلْقَلto disturb.” (See Chapter 25 for more details.)
1.10 Verb moods
Verbs reflect whether the sentence conveys a simple statement of fact; expresses 
a belief, ability, or desire; gives a direct command; or states a conditional situation. 
These different nuances are called moods. The moods of Arabic verbs pertain 
only to the present tense. The past tense does not have moods.
1.10.1 Indicative mood حالةُ الرَّفْع
Verbs in the indicative mood comprise the majority of verb usage in the  
language. The indicative mood expresses statements of facts or opinions, as in 
the following examples:
.ٍُ عُ نْوانَهُ كُلَّ سَ نَةّيرَيُغHe changes his address annually.
.َتَدْرُسُ اإلِسبانِيَّةShe is studying Spanish.
1.10.2 Subjunctive mood
This mood occurs in dependent clauses following verbs in the main clause  
using, among many others, verbs like َ“ أَمِلhope,” َ“ أَرادwant,” َنّىَم“ تwish,” َ رَغِب
“desire,” “ خافfear,” َّ“ أَحَ بwant, like, love,” َّ“ وَدdesire,” َ“ نَصَ حadvise,”  
ََحَر“ اِقْتsuggest.” Such verbs must be followed by a finite set of particles,  
called “ أدَوات النَّصْ بsubjunctive particles,” that are in turn followed by verbs 
having endings different from those in the indicative mood. Discussion of this 
and the particles that cause this change in verb endings is in Chapter 13.
The subjunctive in Arabic is not dissimilar to changes in present tense verbs for 
the English third person singular pronouns, “he” and “she”. In the environment of 
verbs like “suggest,” “advise,” “recommend,” etc., the verbs following in the depend
ent clause have different endings from the indicative, as in the following examples:
I suggest that he change his address annually.
Her advisor recommends that she study Spanish.

The verb system in Arabic
15
1.10.3 Jussive mood
Verbs in this mood can occur in main and subordinate clauses and assume 
different endings from those in the indicative, with some similarity to those in 
the subjunctive. This includes the use of the imperative mood, conditionals 
(both in the main and conditional clauses), and the use of the negative particle 
ْ لَـمto negate past tense actions. (Jussive with conditionals is in Chapter 20, 
and with ْ َم لis in Chapter 15.)
1.10.4 Imperative mood
The imperative mood expresses a direct command in either the affirmative or 
negative. It is generally addressed to the second person, i.e. the various forms 
of “you.” (See Chapter 17 for a detailed discussion.)

The definition of nouns by linguists faces controversy as one definition by 
certain criteria may not fit all languages in the world. We will nonetheless  
attempt to provide a working definition of nouns. A noun denotes a person, 
place, thing or abstract idea. As members of a lexical category nouns can 
perform certain functions in the language. For example, the Arabic word ٌ شَ جَ رَة
“tree,” while referring to an entity known to all readers, can only function as 
a subject of a sentence, or a direct object of a transitive verb, or it can be pre-
ceded by a preposition like “ عَىلon,” or َْتَح“ تunder,” and so on. This Arabic 
word can also vary its number as it can be put in dual or plural; in addition 
the definite article “ اَلـthe” can attach to it. On the other hand, the English 
equivalent tree can do some but not all of the preceding functions of the Arabic 
noun; for example it cannot have a dual form morphologically by adding a 
suffix as in the Arabic case; yet the English tree can, albeit not commonly, be 
used as a verb, which the Arabic equivalent cannot.
2.1 Types of nouns
Nouns in Arabic are generally derived from verbs. ٌ“ كِتابbook,” for example, 
is derived from the verbs َ“ كَتَبto write,” and ٌ“ مِفْتاحkey,” from َ“ فَتَحto open,” 
according to a certain pattern (see Chapter 28). A noun of this type is often 
referred to as “ اِسْ م مُشْ تَقderivative,” extracted from a verb form. Other nouns 
such as ٌ ْن“ عَيeye,” ٌ“ فَرَسhorse,” or ٌ“ بَطَّ ةduck,” are not derived from verbs; 
they are often labeled as “ اِسْ م جامِدprimitive,” or “stationary.” Other types of 
nouns that Arab grammarians recognize in their rich grammar tradition are 
nouns that express concrete objects such as ٌ“ حَ جَ رstone,” or abstract ideas such 
as ٌ“ عِلْمknowledge,” or ٌ“ جَ هْلignorance.” These are grouped under  اِسْ م جِ نْس
“a generic or common noun.” Contrasted with this, there exists a category of 
nouns known by the name “ اِسْ م عَلَمproper nouns,” to refer to named entities, 
such as “ عُ مَرOmar,” “ سوزانSusanne,” “ القاهِرَةCairo,” and so on.

Nouns derived from verbal forms are of many types, including, among 
others, ( املَصادِرplural of “ )مَصْ دَرverbal nouns or gerunds” (see Chapter 25); 
“ أَسْ امء  الفاعِلagentive nouns,” or “active participles” (see Chapter 23);  
“ أَسْ امء املَفْعولpassive participles” (see Chapter 24). Plurals of noun  أَسْ امء املَكان
“place nouns,” “ أَسْ امء  املِهْنَةnouns of profession,” “ أَسامء  الوِحْ دةunit nouns,” 
“ أَسْ امء اآللةinstrument nouns,” etc. are all discussed in Chapter 28.
It is necessary to mention here that Arabic categorizes plural nouns in two 
groups: human, such as َ“ مُوَظَّ فونemployees,” ٌ“ طُالّبstudents,” ٌ“ مُديراتdirectors 
(F),” and non-human, as in ٌ“ كِالبdogs,” ُ“ مَدارِسschools,” ٌ“ طائراتairplanes.” 
Non-human plural nouns are treated as feminine singular in all their behavior 
in the language. We turn now to discuss various features of nouns.
2.2 Gende
Nouns in Arabic are grouped in three classes with respect to gender. A noun 
can be masculine  ,مُذَكَّرfeminine  ,مُؤَنَّثor, as in the case of a few nouns, either 
masculine or feminine. There is no neuter in Arabic.
Feminine nouns can be most readily recognized by their form, ending with 
 ةtaa’ marbuuTa as in ٌ“ قَرْيَةvillage,” ٌ“ عاصِ مَةcapital.” They can also be identified 
by three other endings: the long ’alif  اas in “ دُنياlife, world,” or the ’alif  maqSuura 
 ىas in ّىُم“ حfever,” ىْر“ بُشgood news,” or, in some cases, ’alif  hamza  اءas in 
“ صَ حْ راءdesert,” “ حِ رْباءchameleon.” Moreover, feminine nouns can be  
recognized by what they signify, for instance a female entity such as ٌّ“ أُمmother,” 
or ٌ“ عَروسbride.” Feminine nouns can indicate a natural or real feminine  
entity such as ٌ“ اِمْرَأَةwoman,” or an assigned gender such as “ الشَّ مْسthe sun,” 
or “ األَرْضthe earth, land.”
We must also emphasize that all cities in Arabic are treated as feminine 
nouns. Countries, on the other hand, can be either feminine or masculine. 
Countries that are written with regular ’alif or taa’ marbuuTa are always feminine, 
as in ( أَمْريكاwritten as  أَمْريكةby some) or  ,سوريا  /  سوريةetc. Some other 
countries are treated as masculine, for example  العِراقor .السّ ودان
As a general rule, nouns can be changed into their feminine forms through 
the addition of taa’ marbuuTa  ةpreceded by a fat-Ha at the end of the masculine 
noun. For example, ٌ“ طالِبstudent (M),” becomes ٌ“ طالِبَةstudent (F).” (Note 
that the taa’ marbuuTa  ةis represented in the orthography as a taa’ maftuuHa 
 تwhen a suffix, such as a possessive suffix pronoun, is added to feminine 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
18
nouns.) However, the feminine forms of the masculine “ أَوَّلfirst,” “ آخَ رother,” 
and “ أَحَ دone of” end with ’alif  maqSuura, as in “ أُوىلfirst (F),” “ أُخْ رىother 
(F),” and “ إِحْ دىone of,” respectively, not to mention other phonological 
changes in these words that are beyond this discussion.
It is worthy of mention that there are a few masculine nouns that end with 
taa’ marbuuTa. These include, among others, “ خَ ليفَةcaliph,” also a man’s name,” 
“ أُسامَةOsama,” “ رَحّ الَةavid traveler,” “ عَالّمَةerudite scholar,” etc.
Finally, there are a few instances where a noun can be used in either the 
masculine or the feminine. Such examples include ٌ“ سوقsuq, market,” ٌ دُكّان
“shop,” ٌنيّ“ سِ كknife,” ٌ“ طَ ريقway, path.”
2.3 
umbe
Nouns in Arabic can be in the singular, dual or plural. Plural nouns are treated 
in some detail in Chapter 28.
Dual formation, masculine or feminine, is accomplished by the suffixation 
of ِ انto the termination of singular nouns. The  ةtaa’ marbuuTa of feminine 
nouns changes in this case to a regular taa’  ,تtaa’ maftuuHa or taa’ Tawiila (as 
it is called by some), as in the following examples:
Singular nominative
Dual nominative
ٌطالِب
طالِبانِTwo students (M)
ٌمُعَلِّم
مُعَلِّامنِTwo teachers (M)
Singular nominative
Dual nominative
ٌطالِبَة
طالِبَتانِTwo students (F)
ٌمُعَلِّمَة
مُعَلِّمَتانِTwo teachers (F)
The examples in the dual, masculine and feminine, in the preceding tables, are 
in the nominative case, known by the Arabic name  .مَرْفوعNouns, regardless 
of number, take different endings, depending on their function in the sentence. 
(See Chapter 3 for discussion of the Arabic case system.) By coincidence, dual 
nouns have the same ending in the accusative and genitive cases, namely ِ .يْن
In other words,  انchanges to ِ يْنas shown in the following tables:

Singular nouns that end with ’alif  maqSuura require the insertion of yaa’  ي
before the dual marker ِ انis suffixed. Thus, “ مَلْهىentertainment place,” and 
“ فَتْوىreligious legal opinion,” become ِ مَلْهَيانand ِ فَتْوَيانrespectively. Similarly, 
singular nouns whose ending is yaa’ elided with tanwiin kasra as in ٍ“ ماشa 
walker,” and ٍ“ بانa builder,” for example, require the insertion of yaa’ before 
the dual suffix is added. Thus, we obtain ِ ماشِ يانand ِ بانِيانrespectively.
The dual of singular nouns which end with ’alif  hamza  اءas in  صَ حْ راء
“desert,” and “ سَ امءsky,” requires the insertion of waaw  وbefore the dual suffix 
is attached. Thus, we obtain ِ“ صَ حْ راوانtwo deserts,” and ِ“ سَ اموانtwo skies.” 
Similarly, ٌ“ أَبfather,” and ٌ“ أَخbrother,” and the others in this group (see ُ األَسْ امء
 اخلمسةat the end of this chapter) require the insertion of waaw before the dual 
suffix is attached, as in the following: ِ“ أَبَوانtwo fathers,” and ِ“ أَخَ وانtwo brothers.”
2.4 
e e min
ion of nouns
Arab grammarians follow the tradition of citing nouns in dictionaries or in 
glossary lists in their indefinite, nominative, masculine forms. For example, 
ٌ“ مُعَلِّمteacher (M),” ends with two Dhammas   ٌ   in its orthographic representa-
tion in a glossary list. The first Dhamma ُ  indicates that this noun is in the nom
inative case; the second indicates the noun is indefinite. The second Dhamma 
has the value of an -n sound, a process referred to as tanwiin in Arabic. The case 
system in Arabic is discussed in some detail in Chapter 3.
There are four different ways of changing nouns (and adjectives for that 
matter) from indefinite to definite, i.e. unknown or unspecified entity to known, 
specified. This process is known by the name of determination, or  تَعْريف االِسْ م
in Arabic.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

1.
Nouns are made definite by the pre-fixation of the definite article  الـ
“the” to common nouns. By placing  الـin front of the common noun, the 
indefinite marker, i.e. the second -n sounding Dhamma mentioned above is 
dropped and the noun remains with only one Dhamma at its end. Thus, 
ٌ“ مُعَلِّمteacher” becomes ُ“ املُعَلِّمthe teacher.”
The use of the definite article  الـis common in Arabic to indicate  
general categories or to make categorical statements. Thus, one speaks  
of “ السَّ يّارَةcar” in Arabic without a reference to a specific car but to  
the means of transportation in general. In addition,  الـis commonly  
used with plural nouns to indicate categories. For example,  الطالّب
“students” expresses a categorical statement without specifying particular 
individuals.
2.
Nouns become definite by suffixing a possessive pronoun (see Chapter 5). 
If we take ٌ“ مُعَلِّمteacher,” and add the possessive suffix “ ناour,” we obtain 
“ مُعَلِّمُ ناour teacher.” Notice that the second Dhamma in ٌ ,مُعَلِّمthe  
marker of indefiniteness, is dropped, whereas the nominative case marker 
is maintained.
3.
Nouns become definite in IDhaafa-constructs whose terminal noun is definite. 
In the example ِ“ كِتابُ  املُعَلِّمlit. the book of the teacher; the teacher’s  
book,” the first noun  كِتابdoes not carry “ الـthe,” yet it is interpreted as 
specified, known to readers or speakers by virtue of the definite noun  
 .املُعَلِّمThus, while the initial noun is not carrying the definite article  الـit 
can be interpreted as definite by virtue of the terminal definite noun in 
such structures. However, if the second noun in IDhaafa-constructs is  
indefinite, then both elements in the construct are not specified, they  
are indefinite. Thus, ٍ كِتابُ مُعَلِّمwould refer to an unspecified book belong-
ing to some unspecified teacher, “book of a teacher, a teacher’s book.” (See 
Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion.)
4.
Abstract nouns such as ُ“ احلُرِّيَّةfreedom,” ُ“ الصَّ داقَةfriendship,” “ التَّعليمlearn-
ing, education,” ُّ“ احلُبlove,” etc. are always definite and are used with the 
definite article  الـor as a part of IDhaafa.
5.
Finally, a noun is definite, i.e.  اِسْ م مُعَرَّفby virtue of its being a proper 
noun. Thus, names of people or other entities such as “ عَيلAli” or  مَرْيَم
“Maryam” or “ دِمَشْ قDamascus” or “ نْيويوركNew York” are known enti-
ties and recognized to be definite by virtue of their being known to those  
involved in interlocution.

Nouns

2.5 un
ion of nouns
Nouns can play the following functions which are subject to certain requirements, 
conditions and/or constraints, as will be seen below:
1.
Subjects of nominal or equational sentences: As subjects of this sentential 
structure, nouns must be definite (see the preceding section). In addition, 
common nouns must be in the nominative case (see Chapter 3). Nouns in 
the subject position can be singular, dual or plural, as in the following 
examples:
. ٌاملُعَلِّمُ جَ ديدThe teacher (M, Sg) is new.
.الصَّ ديقانِ مِن سورياThe two friends (M, D) are from Syria.
. ِالبَناتُ يف املَلْعَبThe girls (F, Pl) are on the playground.
2.
Predicates of nominal or equational sentences: Nouns as predicates are 
placed after subjects have been introduced. Predicates of equational/nominal 
sentences can be common or proper nouns. Common nouns in the predicate 
position must be indefinite and also nominative, as illustrated below:
.ٌهِيَ مُديرَةShe is a director.
. ٌهُ م طُ الّبThey are students.
Predicate nouns can also be definite. In this case, the subject and predicate 
must be separated by a third person pronoun, depending on the number 
and gender of the subject. In other words, it can be the third person  
singular pronouns َ هُ وor َ ,هِيthe dual pronoun اُم ,هor the plural pronouns 
ْ هُ مor َّ هُ نas in the following examples:
.ُْمود هُ وَ املُديرَحم
Mahmoud is the director.
.ِا املُوَظَّ فتانُمسامِيَة ولَيىل ه
Samia and Leila are the employees (F, D).
. َمَّد هُ م املُدَرِّسونُحجورج وموسى وم
George, Musa and Mohammed are the teachers (M, Pl).

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
22
3.
Predicate nouns of equational sentences preceded by one of the members 
of َ كانand its “sisters” (its verb group) must change into the accusative 
(see Chapter 10 on kaana). The subject of such sentences must remain 
nominative, as in the following:
.ًكانَ الرَّجُ لُ مُوَظَّ فاThe man was an employee.
.ًلَيْسَ ت املَرْأَةُ مُديرَةThe woman is not a director.
4.
Nouns in subject positions preceded by one of the members of َّ إِنand its 
“sisters” must be in the accusative case. The noun or adjective predicate of 
such sentences must maintain its nominative case, as in the following:
. ٌيلَمإِنَّ الطَّ قْسَ جIndeed the weather is beautiful.
5.
Verbal sentences are those in which verbs are in initial positions in sentence 
structures. Nouns following verbs in these sentences can be performers of 
actions expressed by the verbs and are known as the  فاعِلin Arabic grammar 
terminology. In such cases, the  فاعِلmust be in the nominative case. The 
 فاعِلcan be definite or indefinite. However, the  فاعِلgender determines  
the gender of the verb. In other words, if the  فاعِلis a masculine noun, 
the verb must also exhibit this gender; similarly, if it is feminine, the verb 
must also be marked for feminine. Examine the following:
. ُنامَ الطِّ فْلThe baby (M) went to sleep.
.ُضَ حِ كَ ت األُستاذَةThe teacher (F) laughed.
.ٌوَصَ لَت سَ يّارَةA car arrived.
The  فاعِلfollowing the verb could be in the singular, dual or plural. However, 
the verb in verbal sentences when it occupies its usual initial position must 
always be singular. The verb needs only to be marked for gender, i.e.  
masculine or feminine determined by the gender of the  ,فاعِلas in the  
following:
.ِعادَ الصَّ ديقانThe friends (M, D) returned.
.زارتِ البَناتُ مِصThe girls (F, Pl) visited Egypt.

Nouns

6.
Nouns can be direct objects of transitive verbs (see Chapter 11). Direct 
objects of transitive verbs must be in the accusative case. In singular nouns, 
direct objects end with one fat-Ha if they are definite. Indefinite, direct 
objects end with two fat-Has. Dual nouns in the direct object position must 
end with ِ .ـَ يْنRegular plural masculine nouns end with َ ;ينregular feminine 
plural nouns in object position end with one kasra if they are definite or 
two if they are indefinite. Examine the following examples:
.َأَكَلَت هِند اخلُبْزHend ate the bread.
.ِ ْنشاهَدَ صديقي فِلمَيMy friend saw two films.
.َقابَلْنا املُهَنْدسنيWe met the engineers.
. ِدَرَّسَ سامي الطالباتSami taught the girls.
. ٍسامي دَرَّسَ طالباتSami taught girls.
Some transitive verbs like “ أَعْطىto give,” َ“ اِنْتَخَ بto elect,” َ َّن“ عَيto appoint,” 
take two direct objects. Note that in English this operation would be  
accomplished either with an indirect object, or the object of a preposition 
such as “to” or “as.” Examine the following:
.ًأَعْطى األبُ البِنْتَ كِتاباThe father gave the girl a book.
.ًِكَةُ املُوَظَّ فَ مُديراَّرعَيَّنَتِ الشThe company appointed the employee  
as director.
7.
Nouns can be preceded by prepositions. In this case, nouns must be in the 
genitive case (see Chapter 3), ending with one kasra if they are singular 
and definite, or two kasras if they are singular and indefinite. In pronun-
ciation, the kasra is pronounced -i; the two kasras are pronounced -in; this 
phenomenon is called tanwiin in Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, proper 
nouns are usually not marked for case unless the text is of a very formal 
quality, as in formal reading of the news, or in scripted speeches delivered 
on highly formal occasions. Examine the following:
ِيف البيْتin the house
ٍيف بَيْتin a house

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
24
Dual nouns preceded by prepositions end with ِ ـَ يْنas in:
ِ ْنمَعَ صَ ديقَيwith two friends (M, D)
ِ ْنمَعَ صَ ديقَتَيwith two friends (F, D)
Regular masculine plural nouns end with َ ينwhen preceded by prepositions:
َمَعَ مُديرينwith directors (M, Pl)
Regular feminine plural nouns end with one kasra if they are definite, or 
two kasras if they are indefinite:
ِمَعَ الطالِباتwith the students (F, Pl)
ٍمَعَ طالِباتwith students (F, Pl)
8.
Finally, nouns can be constituents of IDhaafa-constructs (see Chapter 8). 
If a noun is the first element of such a construct, its case varies depending 
on its function in the sentence. The first noun in such a construct can never 
have a definite article. Nor can it have tanwiin, the -n sounding orthographic 
symbol. A noun in the second position in IDhaafa-constructs must always 
be in the genitive. It can be either definite or indefinite. If definite, it ends 
only with one kasra; if indefinite, it ends with two kasras, as illustrated below:
ِصَ ديقَةُ األُستاذthe teacher’s friend (F) (lit. “the friend  
of the teacher”)
ٍصَ ديقَةُ أُسْ تاذa friend (F) of a teacher
ِمَعَ صَ ديقَةِ األُستاذwith the teacher’s friend (F)
IDhaafa-constructs may contain more than two nouns. All nouns in such a 
construct, except the first one, must be in the genitive case, ending in only one 
kasra. The terminal noun can only be either definite, carrying the article  الـfor 
example, or indefinite, thus ending with two kasras, as in the examples below:
ِكِتابُ طالِبِ اجلامِعَةthe book of the university student
ٍكِتابُ طالِبِ جامِعَةa book of a student of (some) university

The following nouns, known by the Arabic name “ األَسامءُ اخلَمْسَ ةthe five nouns,” 
form a special category; some grammarians speak of a sixth noun. They are 
marked by waaw in the nominative case, ’alif in the accusative, and yaa’ in the 
genitive. (See Chapter 3 for the case system in Arabic.) Further discussion of 
these nouns will be in Chapter 28, section 28.6.

A brief word about case systems in languages is necessary. How nouns,  
pronouns, or adjectives are understood in their different functions in sentences 
is a matter of precision and clarity. In Arabic, as well as in German, Latin, 
Greek and Russian, among others, nouns and pronouns assume different forms 
or endings when performing specific functions in a sentence. A noun functioning 
as the subject of an equational/nominal sentence, or as the performer of an 
action in a verbal sentence, for example, may exhibit a different ending from 
that used when that noun is the object of a transitive verb. Different languages 
employ different cases; the number of cases varies from one language to another. 
The three cases that Arabic uses—nominative, accusative and genitive—are 
among the most common.
3.1 The Case 
ys em in nglish
Only pronouns observe a case system in English. The pronoun “he,” for example, 
can only be used as the subject of a sentence. Such a pronoun is said to be in 
the nominative case, because of its function. This same pronoun changes to 
“him” when the pronoun is used after a verb that requires a direct object, such 
as in the sentence “I saw him.” In this case, he is the recipient of the verb 
“saw,” and is said to be in the accusative case. Finally, to express possession, 
“he” changes into a third form, namely “his,” as in “This is his book.” “His” 
is in the genitive case, used, in this instance, to express possession. English 
nouns and adjectives have lost case markers that at one time existed in the 
language. One residue of cases in English nouns appears in the possessive 
system in the language, expressed in the writing system by the ’s (apostrophe 
s) as in “the King’s English.” As the cases dropped, word order in the sentence 
structure became a determining factor in conveying the intended meaning. 
Thus, the words “boy” and “teacher” in the following two sentences convey 
C

different functions expressed only by the order of words. The “teacher” in the 
first sentence is the performer of action, and the “boy” the recipient; the roles 
are reversed in the second sentence:
1.
The teacher saw the boy.
2.
The boy saw the teacher.
3.2 The 
ase sys em in 
abi
Pronouns and their cases in Arabic are introduced in Chapter 5. In this section 
the case system for nouns and adjectives is examined. While word order is 
important in Modern Standard Arabic, the language employs three cases to 
express relationships among words in sentences. These three cases are marked 
by different vowel sounds at the end of nouns and adjectives to express the 
various functions of these elements. The cases in Arabic are also marked in 
the orthography by various devices outlined below. It should be emphasized that 
adjectives used to modify nouns exhibit the same cases as those nouns, both in 
their phonological representation as well as in the orthography. The three cases 
in Arabic apply to singular, dual and plural nouns and adjectives. Pronouns as 
direct objects are explained when we examine verbal sentences in Chapter 11.
It is necessary to mention that the case system is a feature of classical as 
well as Modern Standard Arabic. The use of cases, however, is observed  
primarily in formal situations like public speeches, news broadcasts, university 
and public lectures, and scripted texts. We shall now turn to discuss briefly the 
three cases governing Arabic nouns. Adjectives and their cases are discussed 
in Chapter 4.
3.3 The nomina ive 
ase
In general, the nominative case is used in the following instances:
1.
when a noun is in the subject position of an equational/nominal sentence,
2.
when a noun or adjective is the predicate of an equational/nominal sentence 
(see Chapter 3), and
3.
when it is performer of an action, i.e.,  فاعِلin a verbal sentence (see  
Chapter 11).

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
28
Cases apply to singular, dual and plural nouns. In addition, adjectives 
modifying nominative nouns must also be marked for this same case. Nouns 
in the singular, dual and/or plural are marked by different endings for this case, 
as illustrated below.
3.3.1 Nominative singular nouns
In singular indefinite common nouns, the nominative case is marked by the 
sound -un at their end. The noun in this case is referred to as  اِسْ م مَرْفوعin the 
Arabic. In the orthography, this is generally marked by the writing of two 
terminal Dhammas. On the other hand, a singular definite noun in the nominative 
case has at its end one Dhamma, pronounced -u. Let us illustrate this by using 
a common noun such as “ بَيْتhouse.” If  بَيْتis the subject of an equational/
nominal sentence, it must be definite, pronounced with terminal -u, represented 
by one terminal Dhamma in the orthography, as in ٌ“ البَيْتُ كَبريThe house is 
big.” Adjectives functioning as predicates in equational/nominal sentences in 
the affirmative must also be in the nominative but indefinite. This explains why 
ٌ كَبريin the preceding sentence ends with two Dhammas in the writing system, 
pronounced -un.
Similarly, if  بَيْتis the predicate of an equational/nominal sentence, it must 
be indefinite, pronounced with -un, represented by two Dhammas at its end, as 
in ٌ“ هذا بَيّتThis is a house.” The adjective modifying ٌ بَيْتmust also be indefinite, 
nominative, written with two Dhammas above its terminal consonant, as in: 
ٌ“ هذا بَيْتٌ كَبريThis is a big house.”
3.3.2 Nominative dual nouns
Dual nouns, masculine or feminine, are marked for the nominative case by 
ِان- suffixed to singular nouns. ِ انis part and parcel of this nominative marker 
that always remains the same, always indivisible. In other words, the kasra in 
ِ انis not a marker of the genitive case in singular nouns. Nouns such as ِ صَ ديقان
“two friends (M),” or ِ“ صَ ديقَتانtwo friends (F),” are to be used only as subjects 
or predicates of affirmative equational/nominal sentences, or as  فاعِلperformers 
of actions in verbal sentences (see Chapter 11).

The case system in Arabic
29
3.3.3 Nominative plural nouns
Regular masculine plural nouns in the nominative case are marked by suffixing 
the indivisible suffix َون- to singular nouns. Thus, َ“ مُعَلِّمونteachers,” can only 
function as the subject of equational/nominal sentences, or as the predicate of 
affirmative equational/nominal sentences, or  ,فاعِلi.e. performer of verbs in 
verbal sentences. In the latter case, this plural noun can be either definite or 
indefinite, depending on the intended meaning, as in the following:
. َوَصَ لَ مُعَلِّمون
[Some] teachers arrived.
. َوَصَ لَ املُعَلِّمونThe teachers arrived.
Irregular plural masculine nouns, on the other hand, demonstrate behavior similar 
to that of singular nouns in taking either the definite marker (one Dhamma) or the 
indefinite nunation (two Dhammas). An example is the plural ٌ“ طُ الّبstudents.” 
As the subject of an equational sentence, this noun must be definite, written with 
only one Dhamma, as in َْتَهِدونُج“ الطُ الّبُ مThe students are hard-working.” On 
the other hand, when ٌ طُ الّبis used as the predicate of an affirmative equational 
sentence, it must be indefinite, written with two Dhammas, as in ٌ“ هُ م طُ الّبThey 
are students.” As  فاعِلor performer of verbs in verbal sentences it could be 
either definite or indefinite, depending on the intended meaning.
Regular feminine plural nouns in the nominative case are marked by the 
suffix ٌات- added to singular nouns. Thus, ٌ“ مُديراتdirectors” can function as 
the subject of equational sentences, the predicate of affirmative equational 
sentences, or  ,فاعِلi.e. the performer of verbal sentences. In the latter case, it 
could be either definite with one Dhamma, or indefinite, written with two 
Dhammas, as in the following:
. ُتِ املُديراتَرحَ ضThe directors came.
. ٌَ ت مُديراتَرحَ ض
[Some] directors came.

The second case of nouns or adjectives is referred to as  النَّصْ بin Arabic,  
accusative. A noun in this case is labeled  .اِسْ م مَنصوبFollowing is a partial 
list of situations where nouns or adjectives can be in the accusative case:

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

Direct objects of transitive verbs (see Chapter 11);
2.

Some adverbs (see Chapter 7).
3.4.1 Accusative singular nouns
Singular definite nouns functioning as direct objects of transitive verbs such as 
the verb “ بَنىto build,” for example, must end with one fat-Ha at the end of 
the noun, as in:
. َجورج بَنى البَيْتGeorge built the house.
If  بَيْتin the preceding example is indefinite, it must end with two fat-Has 
placed on an ’alif, which, in this case, has no phonetic value, i.e., it is not 
pronounced but used as a carrier of the two fat-Has, as in the following:
.ًجورج بَنَى بَيْتاGeorge built a house.
In feminine nouns, the two fat-Has are written above  ,ةthe taa’marbuuTa, 
as in:
.ًجورج شاهَدَ سَ يّارَةGeorge saw a car.
3.4.2 Accusative dual nouns
Accusative dual nouns, masculine or feminine, are marked by َِ يْن- suffixed to 
singular nouns. َِ يْن- always remains the same, is always indivisible. Nouns such 
as ِ ْن“ صَ ديقَيtwo friends (M),” or ِ ْن“ صَ ديقَتَيtwo friends (F),” are to be used only 
as objects of transitive verbs, or predicates of equational/nominal sentences 

The case system in Arabic
31
preceded by a member of َ كانand its “sisters,” or in some other environments 
(see Chapter 3).
3.4.3 Accusative plural nouns
Regular masculine plural nouns in the accusative case are marked by adding 
the indivisible suffix َين-. Thus, َ“ مُعَلِّمنيteachers” can only function as object 
of transitive verbs, or predicate of equational/nominal sentences when preceded 
by َ كانor any of its “sisters,” or in some other environments.
Irregular plural masculine nouns, on the other hand, generally demon
strate behavior similar to that of singular nouns in the accusative case. Take, 
for example, the plural “ طُ الّبstudents.” As the object of a transitive verb,  
this noun can be definite, written with only one fat-Ha َ“ الطالّبthe students,” 
as in:
. َسامي دَرَّسَ الطالّبSami taught the students.
Or it can be indefinite, written with two fat-Has ً“ طُ الّباstudents.” The two fat-
Has are written on a regular ’alif  that has no phonetic value, as in:
.ًسامي دَرَّسَ طُ الّباSami taught students.
Regular indefinite feminine plural nouns in the accusative case are marked by 
the suffix ٍات-. Thus, ٍ“ مُديراتdirectors” can function as the object of transitive 
verbs, or the predicate of affirmative equational sentences preceded by َ كانor 
any of its “sisters.” In the latter case, it could be either definite with one kasra, 
or indefinite, written with two kasras. Adjectives modifying accusative nouns 
must assume the same cases as the nouns they modify.
3.5 The geni ive 
ase
The genitive case ّ جَ رis used for nouns following prepositions and for the second 
and subsequent terms of the IDhaafa-construct. The IDhaafa-construct is dis-
cussed in some detail in Chapter 8.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
32
3.5.1 Genitive singular nouns
Singular indefinite nouns are marked by two kasras at their end, pronounced 
-in. Definite singular nouns in the genitive case end with one kasra.
3.5.2 Genitive dual nouns
Dual nouns, masculine or feminine, are marked for the genitive case by ِيْن َ-, 
which is one indivisible unit. This form is identical to the accusative dual form. 
Nouns such as ِ ْن“ صَ ديقَيtwo friends (M),” or ِ ْن“ صَ ديقَتَيtwo friends (F),” are to 
be used after prepositions, or as the second noun of an IDhaafa-construct, as in:
ِ ْنِ / صَ ديقَتَيْنبَيْتُ صَ ديقَيa house of two friends (M/F)
3.5.3 Genitive plural nouns
Regular masculine plural nouns in the genitive case are marked by adding  
the indivisible suffix َين-. Thus, َ“ مُعَلِّمنيteachers” assumes this form after  
prepositions, or if it is used as a second noun in an IDhaafa-construct, as  
in َ“ مَكْ تَبُ مُعَلِّمنيteachers’ office.”
Irregular plural masculine nouns demonstrate behavior similar to that of 
singular nouns in taking definite or indefinite markers. Let us take as an example 
the plural ٌ“ طُ الّبstudents.” When preceded by a preposition, this noun can 
be definite, written with only one kasra ِ“ الطُ الّبthe students,” as in ِ مَعَ الطالّب
“with the students.” Or it can be indefinite as in ٍ“ طُ الّبstudents,” written with 
two terminal kasras, as in:
ٍمَعَ طُ الّبwith students
Regular indefinite feminine plural nouns in the genitive case are marked by the 
suffix ٍات-, identical to feminine plural nouns in the accusative case. Thus, 
ٍ“ مُديراتdirectors” assumes this form when preceded by a preposition, or when 
used as a second noun in an IDhaafa-construct. In the latter case, it could be 
either definite, written with one kasra, as in ِ“ مَكاتِبُ املُديراتthe offices of the 
directors,” or it could be indefinite, written with two kasras, as in ٍ مَكاتِبُ مُديرات
“offices of directors.”

Adjectives are elements in the language that modify nouns, adding more  
information about them. Adjectives can also function as nouns in that they 
can be subjects of sentences, objects of verbs, governed by prepositions, etc. 
Regular adjectives such as ٌ“ كَبريbig, large” or ٌ“ جَ ديدnew” are commonly used 
as predicates of equational sentences (see Chapter 9). For the comparative and 
superlative forms of adjectives, see Chapter 27.
4.1 Common forms of adje tives
4.1.1 Regular adjectives
Like many nouns in Arabic, adjectives can be derived from verbs according to 
particular patterns. A common adjectival form is of the ٌ فَعيلpattern, producing, 
for example, ٌ“ كَبريbig, large,” from َ ُر“ كَبto become big,” or ٌ“ جَ ديدnew,” from 
َدُ“ جَ دto become new.”
4.1.2 Color words and traits as adjectives
4.1.2.1 Color words
Words for basic colors: red, blue, yellow, etc. can function both as nouns and 
adjectives. Many of the color words in Arabic follow the pattern of ُ أَفْعَلwhen 
used to modify masculine nouns (see Chapter 27). The feminine form of color 
words is formed from ُ أَفْعَلwords according to the pattern ُ فَعْالءas illustrated 
in the following table:

ُأَسْ وَدُسَ وْداءblack
ُأصْ فَرُصَ فْراءyellow
ُأبْيَضُبَيْضاءwhite
ُأَزْرَقُزَرْقاءblue
َُ رأَخْ ضُاءْرخَ ضgreen
ُأَشْ قَرُشَ قْراءblond
The intensity or degree of color is gauged by either “ غامِقdeep, dark” or  فاتِح
“light,” as in, for example, “ أَخْ ض غَامِقdeep green,” or “ أَخْ ض فاتِحlight green.” 
Some color words collocate with certain adjectives: ٌ ناصِ عُ“ أبْيَضsnow white,” 
ٌ  قاتِمُ“ أسْ وَدpitch black,” ٍ  قانَُرَم“ أحblood red,” and “ أصْ فَر  فاقِعintense/bright 
yellow.”
The masculine dual of color adjectives is formed by the dual marker ِان, 
as in ِ“ بَيْتانِ أبْيَضانtwo white houses,” and ِالنِ أشْ قَرانُ“ رَجtwo blond men.” The 
feminine dual however is formed by dropping the hamza, inserting a waaw and 
adding the suffix ِ ,انas in ِ“ بِنْتانِ شَ قْراوانtwo blond girls,” and ِْراوانَم سَ يّارَتانِ ح
“two red cars.”
The plurals of the colors in the above table for human masculine nouns 
follow the ٌعْلُ فpattern, as in the following: ، ٌ ْرضُرْقٌ ، خُفْرٌ، بيضٌ ، زُْرٌ، سودٌ، صُم ح
قْرٌُ .شThe case of these plural colors changes according to the case of the nouns 
they modify. Of these plural adjectives only two are actually used for humans, 
namely ٌ“ سودblack,” and ٌ“ بيضwhite,” as in the following: ٌ“ رِجالٌ سودblack 
men,” and ٌ“ رِجالٌ  بيضwhite men.” The plural adjective ٌْرُم“ حred” is used, 
despite its current political unacceptability, at least in English, to refer to native 
American citizens as in ُمْرُ احلُنودُ“ اهلRed Indians.”
On the other hand, the plural adjectives for human feminine nouns follow 
the pattern  .فَعْالواتThus, according to this pattern, we obtain ،ْراواتَم ح
اوات، شَ قْراواتْر .سَ وْداوات، صَ فْراوات، بَيْضاوات، زَرْقاوات، خَ ضOf these plural  
adjectives, only two can be used for humans, namely ٌ“ بَيْضاواتwhite,” and

ٌ“ شَ قْراواتblond,” as in, for example, ٌ“ بَناتٌ  شَ قْراواتblond young women,”  
ٌ“ نِساءٌ  بَيْضاواتwhite women,” ٌ“ سَ يّداتٌ  سَ مْراواتdark [skinned] ladies,” ٌ بَنات
“ سَ وْداواتٌblack young women.”
Non-human plural nouns take singular feminine adjectives, as in, for  
example, ُْراءَم“ سَ يّاراتٌ حred cars,” ُ سَ وْداءُ“ حَ قائِبblack bags.” One is likely to 
encounter, for example, ٌرودٌ بيضُ“ وwhite roses,” ٌْرُمرودٌ حُ وand so on with other 
colors for roses.
4.1.2.2 Traits
Words denoting inherent characteristics or defects, often related to humans, 
comply with the pattern ُ أَفْعَلin the masculine, and ُ فَعْالءin the feminine in 
the singular. Consider the examples in the table below:
ُأَفْعَلُفَعْالءMeaning
أَعْمىُعَمْياءblind
ُأَطْ رَشُطَ رْشاءdeaf
َُقْمأَحُْقاءَمحfoolish
ُّأَصَ مُءّاصَ مdeaf, solid
ُأَبْلَهُبَلْهاءstupid
ُأَبْكَ مُامءْبَكdumb
ُأَبْرَصُبَرْصاءleprous
Some of these adjectives exhibit two plurals, one adhering to the ٌعْلُ فpattern, 
and another to the عْالنُ فpattern. Thus we obtain ٌمْيُ عand مْيانُ“ عblind,” and 
ٌرْشُ طand رْشانُ“ طdeaf.” We also see ٌْقُم حand ْقىَم“ حfoolish.” ٌّمُ“ صdeaf,” ٌكْ مُ ب
“dumb,” and ٌلْهُ“ بstupid,” are the only plural forms used.
4.1.3 Nisba adjectives
The word  نِسْ بَةdenotes “with relation to.” A very common adjective form is 
the nisba adjective. Such forms are derived from place names such as a country, 
city, locality, or tribe, and from common nouns by the simple process of  

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
36
suffixing the nisba adjective marker ٌّي- (doubled yaa’ that carries a shadda in 
the writing system). The consonant preceding the doubled yaa’ must end with 
one kasra. Thus, from the name of the city of Damascus  دِمَشْ قwe derive ٌّ دِمَشْ قِي
“Damascene,” from وتْيرَ“ بBeirut,” we derive ٌّ ِيوتْيرَ“ بBeiruti,” and from  ,تَغْلِب
a famous Arab tribe, we derive ٌّ“ تَغْلِبِيtaghlibi, member of the Taghlibs,” from 
the common noun “ رَمْلsand,” we derive ٌّ ِي“ رَمْلsandy,” and so on.
If the noun ends with regular ’alif, the ’alif is dropped before adding the 
nisba yaa’. For example, from “ أَمْريكاAmerica,” we derive ٌّ“ أَمْريكِيAmerican,” 
and from “ فِرَنْسا / فَرَنْساFrance,” we derive ٌّ ِي“ فِرَنْسFrench.” If the place name 
carries the definite article  الْـas in “ العِراقIraq,” and “ الـمَغْرِبMorocco,” the 
definite article is dropped before we add the nisba yaa’. Thus, from  العِراقwe 
derive the nisba adjective ٌّ“ عِراقِيIraqi,” and from  املَغْرِبwe obtain ٌّ ِي مَغْرِب
“Moroccan.” Nisba-adjectives derived from proper nouns are adjectives like any 
other. When used as predicates of equational sentences, they must be indefinite 
and in the nominative case. However, when such adjectives are used to modify 
definite nouns, the definite article is retrieved to modify definite nouns as in 
ُّ العِراقِيُ“ الطّ الِبthe Iraqi student.”
Nisba adjectives are made feminine by the addition of the feminine marker, 
the taa’ marbuuTa  .ةThe masculine adjective ٌّ أَمْريكِيbecomes ٌ أَمْريكِيَّةin the feminine.
4.1.3.1 Nisba adjectives of color words
Nisba adjectives produce the names of all secondary colors. These adjectives 
derive from the names of fruits, flowers, metals, household or consumable 
items. Thus from ٌقالُرْتُ“ بoranges,” we obtain ّ ِيقالُرْتُ“ بorange color.” The feminine 
form of this color adjective is obtained by the addition of the feminine marker, 
the taa’-marbuuTa قالِيَّةُرْتُ .بExamine the list of such non-basic colors below:

4.1.4 Other types of adjective
An active participle  اِسْ م  الفاعِلand a passive participle  اِسْ م  املَفعولcan also 
serve as adjectives. These adjectives are referred to in the Arab grammatical 
tradition as شَ بَّهَة بِاسْ مِ الفاعِل واسْ م املَفعولُ“ صِ فات مadjectives like the active and 
passive participle forms.” “ اِسْ م الفاعِلactive participles” are discussed in detail 
in Chapter 23; passive participle  اِسْ م املَفعولforms are discussed in Chapter 24.
4.2 
oun–adje tive agreement
4.2.1 Noun–adjective agreement in the singular
Adjectives modifying nouns in the singular assume the form of nouns in gender, 
number, determination (definite/indefinite) and case. If a noun is masculine, 
singular, indefinite and nominative, the adjective modifying it must have all 
these features, as in the following:
ٌكاتِبٌ مَشْ هورa famous writer
ُ السُّ ورِيَّةُديرَةُاملthe Syrian director
ٍمَعَ طالِبَةٍ جَ ديدَةwith a new student

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

4.2.2 Noun–adjective agreement in the dual
Dual masculine nouns in the nominative case, definite or indefinite, end with 
ِان-. Accusative and genitive dual masculine nouns, definite or indefinite, end 
with ِيْن-. Dual masculine nouns look like the following in their various cases:
Dual nominative
Dual accusative/genitive
Meaning
ِطالِبان
طالِبَيـْنِtwo students
ِامنِّعَلُم
عَلِّمَيـْنُِمtwo teachers
Dual nouns require dual adjectives that must agree with them in number, case 
and gender. In other words, adjectives used to modify dual masculine nouns 
must end with ِان- in the nominative or ِيْن- in the accusative and genitive, as 
in the following:
Dual nominative
Dual accusative/genitive
Meaning
ِـمْتازانُطالِبانِ م

Dual feminine nouns in the nominative case, definite or indefinite, also end 
with ِ .انRecall that the feminine suffix taa’ marbuuTa in singular feminine 
nouns changes to open  تbefore the addition of ِ .انAccusative and genitive 
dual feminine nouns end with َِ يْن-. Dual feminine nouns look like the follow-

4.2.3 Human noun–adjective agreement in the plural
Plural human nouns are generally modified by plural adjectives that carry the 
regular plural marker for nouns. Thus, masculine human nouns that terminate 
with the nominative suffix َ ون- are modified by adjectives ending with َ ون-. 
Masculine human nouns in the accusative and genitive that end with َ ينare 
modified by adjectives ending in َ ينalso, as in the following table:
Plural nominative
Plural accusative/genitive
Meaning
َعَلِّمونَ مَشْ هورونُم
عَلِّمنيَ مَشْ هورينَُمfamous teachers (M)
There are irregular plural forms of adjectives that tend to collocate with plural 
human nouns in set phrases. These include, among a few others, ٌدُدُ“ جnew,” 
ٌ“ كِبارfamous, big,” ُامءَظُ عor ٌ“ عِظامgreat, big,” ُقَراءُ“ فpoor,” ُ“ أَغْنِياءrich, wealthy,” 
ٌ“ عَرَبArabs,” ٌودَه“ يJews,” ُ“ أَجانِبforeign,” ٌ“ صِ غارyoung,” etc. Thus, the 
adjective َ عَظيمونis acceptable in َدَرِّسونَ عَظيمونُ“ مgreat teachers;” the use of 
ٌ عِظامor امءَظُ عinstead, however, would be more acceptable, more idiomatic. In 
general there is a tendency among speakers to regularize forms in languages. 
It is not unlikely to encounter َ“ غَنِيّونrich,” in place of  أَغْنِياءor َ“ فَقريونpoor,” 
in place of قَراءُ .فHowever, plural nouns like ٌ“ عَرَبArabs,” ٌودَه“ يJews,” and 
ُ“ أَجانِبforeigners” never tolerate a plural form ending with the suffix َ ونor 
its accusative/genitive form َ.ين
Feminine human nouns ending with ات- are modified by adjectives that 
terminate with the suffix ٌات- i.e., ending with two Dhammas in the nominative, 
and with two kasras in the accusative and genitive, as in the following tables:
Plural nominative
Plural accusative/genitive
Meaning

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

4.2.4 Non-human noun–adjective agreement in the plural
Non-human plural nouns must be modified by regular feminine singular  
adjectives. In the nominative, such adjectives carry one Dhamma when the noun 
is definite, and two Dhammas when the noun is indefinite, as in the following:
ُ اجلَديدَةُبُتُالكthe new books
ٌبٌ جَ ديدَةُتُكnew books
If the noun is in the accusative, the adjective carries one fat-Ha if the noun is 
definite, and two fat-Has if it is indefinite. In the writing system indefinite  
accusative masculine nouns require the use of ’alif to carry the two fat-Has. 
The two fat-Has are written above the taa’ marbuuTa in indefinite accusative 
feminine nouns.
َبَ اجلَديدَةُتُالكthe new books
ًباً جَ ديدةُتُكnew books
If the noun is in the genitive, the adjective must carry one kasra if the noun is 
definite, and two kasras if it is indefinite:
ِبِ اجلَديدَةُتُالكthe new books
ٍبٍ جَ ديدَةُتُكnew books

Pronouns are a finite set of words in languages that take the place of nouns 
or refer to them. Pronouns function in similar ways to nouns: they can be 
subjects of equational/nominal sentences and objects of transitive verbs. Some 
pronoun forms can indicate possession. In addition, pronouns can be preceded 
by prepositions, or a group of words Arab grammarians call ( ظُ روفPl of  )ظَ رْف
that are similar to prepositions in their behavior. A list of “ ظُروفadverbs” will 
be provided in Chapter 7. Pronouns in Arabic are of different types and have 
singular, dual and plural forms.
5.1 Personal Pronouns الضَّ امئِر
There are three main categories of personal pronouns: (1) those used to indicate 
the speaker, such as “ أَناI” and ُ“ نَحْ نwe,” referred to as first person pronouns, 
 ضَ مري املُتَكَ لَّمin Arabic; (2) those that indicate the addressee, as in َ“ أَنْتyou,” 
for example, referred to as second person pronouns,  ضَ مري املُخاطَ بin Arabic; 
and (3) those that refer to someone other than the speaker or addressee, such 
as َ“ هُ وhe,” for example, referred to as third person pronouns,  ضَ مري الغائِبin 
Arabic.
The meaning of pronouns, especially the third person pronouns (َ هُ وor َ هِي
and their dual and plural forms), often involves a referent, an antecedent, i.e. 
an entity that has already been introduced in the discourse.

Independent personal pronouns stand alone and function as subjects of  
sentences, as will be discussed in Chapter 9. In the singular they are:

َأَنـْتyou (M)
ِأَنـْتyou (F)

5.1.2 Singular suffixal personal pronouns  
الضَّ امئِر املُتَّصِ لَة يف املُفْرَد
Personal pronouns performing functions other than as subjects of sentences 
are expressed as suffixes in Arabic. These pronouns must be attached to other 
elements in the language: nouns, prepositions, or verbs.
1.
By suffixing possessive pronouns to nouns, the nouns become definite. Consequ­
ently, nouns with suffixal pronouns attached to their endings function as 
subjects of equational sentences. Nouns cannot combine the definite article 
 الـand the possessive pronoun simultaneously. What follows is a list of 
suffixal possessive pronouns in the singular and their respective meanings:
Suffix pronoun form
Meaning
يmy
َكyour (M)
ِكyour (F)
ُهhis/its
هاher/its

Pronouns
43
Attached to nominative nouns such as “ كِتابa book,” the singular possessive 
pronouns appear as follows:
Suffix pronoun form
Meaning
كِتايبmy book
َكِتابُكyour (M) book
ِكِتابُكyour (F) book
ُكِتابُهhis book
اُهكِتابher book
The suffixes are invariable, except for ُ“ هhis.” Nouns in Arabic decline,  
i.e. they assume different endings according to their function in sentences 
(see Chapter 3). If ُه“his” is attached to a noun ending with yaa’ or 
kasra, it changes to ِ .هThe reason for the change of ُ هto ِ هin this case is 
physiologically motivated. As the vocal tract produces the vowel /i/ in  
the kasra or the yaa’ it is natural to continue in the same mode for the 
production of a following vowel, thus causing the Dhamma to change to 
an identical kasra.
2.
The suffixal pronoun forms can be attached to prepositions, as in the table 
below:
Suffix pronoun form
Meaning
معيwith me
َمَعَكwith you (M)
ِمَعَكwith you (F)
ُمَعَهwith him
مَعَهاwith her

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
44
3.
In addition, the suffixal pronoun forms can be attached to the end of verbs, 
thus functioning as direct objects of transitive verbs (see Chapter 11), as in 
the following table:
Suffix pronoun form
Meaning
نيme
َكyou (M)
ِكyou (F)
ُهhim
هاher
Note that the first person singular suffixal pronoun  يassumes the form  ين
when attached to transitive verbs as a direct object. In other words, the 
change from  يto  ينinvolves the insertion of  .نArabic does not allow two 
different vowels in sequence. As verbs in the past end with a fat-Ha, the  ن
is inserted to bridge the transition from the fat-Ha of the verb to  ,يi.e. the 
kasra of the pronoun. This  نis known in Arabic grammar as  نون الوِقايَة
“guarding or preventive nuun,” i.e. it prevents the vowel at the end of the 
verb from being absorbed by the long vowel  .يThis also applies to verbs 
in the present tense ending with a Dhamma.
With prepositions that end with a yaa’, the first person singular suffix  
pronoun  يis followed by a fat-Ha. The combination of the original yaa’  يof 
the preposition and the suffix pronoun yaa’ sounds like a geminated yaa’, i.e.  
doubled, followed by a fat-Ha. Examine the following table:
Preposition
Suffix
Meaning
في

َِّيفin me

The Dhamma of the suffix pronoun ُ هchanges to a kasra, resulting in ِ .فيهThe 
Dhamma in all third person pronouns, singular as in ُ ,هdual as in اُم( هM, F) and 
plural as in ْ هُ مand َّ( هُ نsee below) changes to a kasra when preceded by a yaa’ 
or a kasra. In addition to ِ“ فيهin him,” we obtain “ فيهِامin them (D),” “ فيهِمin 
them (M, Pl)” and َّ“ فيهِنin them (F, Pl)”.
5.1.3 Dual independent personal pronouns  
ضَ امئِر الـمُ ثَنّى املُنْفَصِ لَة
نَحْ نُwe two (M, F)
أَنْتُامyou two (M, F)
اُمهthey two (M, F)
There is not an independent dual pronoun in Arabic; instead the plural pronoun 
ُ نَحْ نis used to represent two people, as well as more than two.
5.1.4 Dual suffixal personal pronouns ضَ امئِر الـمُ ثَنّى املُتَّصِ لَة
1.
The following dual suffix pronouns are suffixed to nouns to indicate possession:
ناour
كُامyour (M, F)
اُمهtheir (M, F)
These pronouns are attached to nominative nouns as follows:
Suffix pronoun form
Meaning
كِتابُناour (M, F) book
كِتابُكُ امyour (M, F) book
ُامُهكِتابtheir (M, F) book
Note that اُمه “their (M, F)” changes to اِم هwhen it is attached to a noun 
ending with a kasra or yaa’.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
46
2.
The following dual suffix pronouns also attach to prepositions or adverbs, 
as with َ“ مَعwith” or “ إِىلto, for,” respectively:
مَعَناwith usإِلَيْناto us, for us (M/F)
مَعَكُ امwith you (M, F)إِلَيْكُ امto you (M/F)
مَعَهُامwith them (M, F)إِلَيْهِامto them (M/F)
Note the change of the ’alif  maqSuura  إِىلinto yaa’. Often ’alif  maqSuura 
changes to yaa’ when suffixes are attached to it.
3.
These dual suffixal pronouns can attach to verbs functioning as direct objects. 
This will be discussed further in Chapter 11.
5.1.5 Plural independent personal pronouns

َّكِتابـُكُ نyour (F) book
كِتابـُهُمtheir (M) book

2.
The suffix pronouns can also attach to prepositions or adverbs, as in the 
following:
مَعَناwith us
ْمَعَكُ مwith you (M, Pl)
َّمَعَكُ نwith you (F, Pl)
ْمَعَهُمwith them (M, Pl)
َّمَعَهُنwith them (F, Pl)
When the suffixal pronouns ْ“ هُ مtheir (M)” and َّ“ هُ نtheir (F)” are preceded 
by a kasra or yaa’, the Dhamma at the beginning of these pronouns changes 
to a kasra, as in the following:
ِمِهيف كِتابin their (M) book
َِّنِهيف كِتابin their (F) book
َّعَلَيْهِنon them (F)
3.
The suffixal plural pronouns can also attach to verbs, thus functioning  
as direct objects with meanings similar to those in the preceding sections 
1 and 2.

5.2 Demons ra ive 
ronouns
Demonstrative pronouns point to nouns and indicate whether they are near  
or far in time and space. The use of demonstrative pronouns in equational 
sentences is discussed in Chapter 9.
5.2.1 Singular demonstrative pronouns  الـمُ فْرَد- أَسْ امء اإلِشارَة
Singular demonstrative pronouns are invariable with respect to case. In other words, 
they exhibit the same endings in the nominative, accusative and genitive cases.
هذا / ذاthis (M)
ِهذِهthis (F)
َذلِكَ / ذاكthat (M)
َتِلْكthat (F)
“ هذاthis (M)” and ِ“ هذِهthis (F)” are used to indicate objects in close proximity 
to the speaker; َ“ ذلِكthat (M)” and َ“ تِلْكthat (F)” are used for entities  
distant from the speaker. َ ذلِكhas other forms which are not commonly used 
but are likely to appear in writing, namely َ ذاكand .ذا
Non-human plural nouns are treated grammatically as feminine singular 
nouns in Arabic, whether reference to such nouns is made by demonstrative 
pronouns, or by the use of adjectives to modify them, or verbs. Reference to 
non human plural nouns such as ٌ“ كُتُبbooks,” ٌ“ سَ يْاراتcars,” or ٌ“ كِالبdogs” 
is accomplished by the use of the singular demonstrative pronouns ِ“ هذِهthis” 
or َ“ تِلْكthat” (see Chapter 5).
5.2.2 Dual demonstrative pronouns  الـمُ ثَنّى- أسامءُ اإلِشارة
هذانِthese two (M)
ِهاتانthese two (F)
These two nouns are used to demonstrate dual nouns that are close to the 
speaker. They are in the nominative case, used when they are subjects or parts 
of subjects of equational sentences (see Chapter 9). In addition, they assume

the same forms when they function as faacil “ فاعِلperformer of action” in

ِ هذانand ِ هاتانassume different endings when they are direct objects of

“adverbs.” The accusative and genitive forms are ِ هذَيْنand ِ ْن.هاتَي
 ذلِكَand َ تِلْكhave the following archaic dual nominative forms to demonstrate 
items distant from the speaker, namely َ ذانِكand َ .تانِكTheir accusative and 
genitive forms are َ ذَيْنِكand َ تَيْنِكrespectively. However, they are rarely used in 
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). They are restricted to grammar books and 
extremely erudite writers/speakers. Instead of those obsolete forms, MSA uses 
the plural forms for these demonstratives, as we shall see below.
5.2.3 Plural demonstrative pronouns  اجلَمْع- أسامءُ اإلِشارة
هؤُالءِThese (M, F)
َأُولئِكThose (M, F)
Both demonstrative pronouns are used to demonstrate human plural nouns. 
ِ هؤُالءis used to demonstrate persons that are close to the speaker; َ أُولئِكon 
the other hand is used to indicate persons distant from the speaker. They are  
invariable with respect to case, assuming the same form regardless of their 
function in sentences. Demonstrative pronouns for non human plural nouns 
are always ِ“ هذِهthis” or َ“ تِلْكthat.”

Arabic has a limited set of words known by the Arabic name ّ حُ روف  اجلَر
“prepositions.” These always precede nouns and cause them to end in formal 
writing with two kasras if they are indefinite, or with one if definite. (See 
Chapter 3 for discussion of the genitive case.) Prepositions may also precede 
pronouns, and they are of two types: bound and independent, free.
6.1 Bound prepositions
Bound prepositions consist of one consonant followed by a vowel. In the writing 
system, bound prepositions are represented by one orthographic symbol for 
the consonant followed by a vowel, usually a kasra or fat-Ha. In the writing 
system, these bound prepositions must attach to the following noun or pronoun, 
as in the following examples:
ِبـat, with, by means of, in
e.g. ِ“ بالبَيْتat the house,” ٍ“ بِسَ يّارَةby means of a car”
ِبِهwith/in him or it
َكـlike
e.g. “ كَأُمِّهاlike her mother.” This specific preposition can only be followed 
by a noun, never by a pronoun.
ِلـto, for

This preposition is followed only by nouns and the suffix pronoun  ي
“my,” for example, ِ“ لِلْمُ عَلِّمfor the teacher,” “ يلfor me.”
َلـto, for
This is a variant of the preceding ِ لـwith the same meaning. This pre­
position, however, must be followed by other suffix pronouns, except  ,ي
e.g. ُ“ لَهfor him, to him,” َ“ لَـكfor you, to you (M, Sg).” It cannot be 
followed by the suffix .ي
6.2 ndependent prepositions
Independent, or free, prepositions usually consist of either two or three letters 
in writing. As was stated above, prepositions always precede nouns that must 
obligatorily end in formal writing or speaking with one kasra if the noun is 
definite or with two (i.e. tanwiin, pronounced -in) if it is indefinite. Examples 
of these prepositions include:
إِىلto, forيفin, at
َبَيـْنbetween, among
َمَعwith
حَ تّىuntil
ْمِنfrom, of
عَىلonلَدىwith, at
ْعَنabout
Traditionally, Arab grammarians tended to include َ“ بَيـْنbetween, among”  
and ُ“ مُنْذsince, for, from” in the list of adverbs,  .الظُ روفThe above independent 
pronouns may be classified into three groups:
6.2.1 Prepositions that precede nouns or pronouns
This group includes “ إِىلto, for,” َ ْن“ بَيbetween,” “ عَىلon,” ْ“ عَنabout,”“ يفin, 
at,” َ“ مَعwith,” ْ“ مِنfrom, of.” The ’alif  maqSuura in “ إىلto,” or “ عَىلon,” 
changes into a yaa’  يwhen a suffix pronoun is attached, as in ِ“ عَلَيْهon him,” 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
52
ِ“ إِلَيْكto you (F, Sg).” Suffixal pronouns attach to prepositions and/or adverbs 
as illustrated below, using َ“ مَعwith” and َ“ أَمامin front of,” respectively:
مَعيwith meأَماميin front of me
َمَعَكwith you (M, Sg)
َأَمامَكin front of you (M, Sg)
ِمَعَكwith you (F, Sg)
ِأَمامَكin front of you (F, Sg)
ُمَعَهwith him/it
ُأَمامَهin front of him/it
مَعَهاwith her/itأَمامَهاin front of her/it
Note that all suffixal pronouns remain unchanged. However, with the prepositions 
“ عَىلon” and “ إِىلto,” three changes take place:
1.
When the pronoun suffixes attach to these prepositions, the ’alif  maqSuura 
 ىat the end of these prepositions is shortened and then a semi consonant 
y  phonetically, represented as a  يin the writing system, is introduced, as 
illustrated below:
عىل
إِىل
ََّيعَل
ََّإلي
عَلَيْكَ
إلَيْكَ
عَلَيْكِ
إِلَيْكِ
عَلَيْهِ
إِلَيْهِ
عَلَيْها
إِلَيْها
2.
The pronoun suffix  يfor the pronoun  أَناcarries a shadda followed by fat-Ha 
in the writing system،, as in َّ َي“ عَلon me,” and َّ َليِ“ إto me, toward me.”
3.
The pronoun suffix ُ هfor the pronoun َ هُ وchanges to ِ هfor the physiological 
reason mentioned in Chapter 5. Similarly, the dual masculine and feminine 
suffixal pronoun اُم“ هthem, their” changes to اِم ,هand the plural masculine 
suffixal pronoun “ هُ مthem, their” and the plural feminine suffixal pronoun 
َّ“ هُ نthem, their” change to  هِمand َّ ,هِنrespectively, when suffixed to 
prepositions ending with ’alif  maqSuura like “ عَىلon” or “ إِىلto, for.” The 
’alif  maqSuura in these prepositions changes to yaa’, which causes the 

Prepositions
53
Dhamma of such suffixes to change to kasra as in the following illustrative 
examples:
ِعَلَيْهon him
إلَيْهِمto them
َّعَلَيْهِنon them (F, Pl)
6.2.2 Prepositions that precede nouns but not  
pronouns
This group includes “ حَ تَّىuntil” and, as mentioned above, the bound preposition 
َ“ كـlike.”
6.2.3 Prepositions that can precede nouns signaling  
time reference
This includes ُ“ مُنْذsince, for, from,” or its variation ْ“ مُذsince, for, from,” as in 
the following:
ٍمُنْذُ ساعَةan hour ago
ِمُنْذُ زيارتِهِ األخريةsince his last visit
ُ مُنذcan be followed by verbs in the same meaning.
.ِ ْنوَصَ لْنَ مُنْذُ يَوْمَيThey (F, Pl) arrived two days ago.
6.3 َ وnd َ تـin 
t -m king
There are two one letter prepositions used in oath making: َ“ وby” and َ“ تـby” 
The first is commonly used as in ِ َّه“ واللby God.” َ تـon the other hand is  
practically obsolete and rarely used in Modern Standard Arabic. It is used only 
with the name of God, as in ِ َّه“ تاللby God.”

Unlike the connotation of “adverb” in English grammar, the following list of 
Arabic words, labeled adverbs of place and time, function like prepositions: 
they make the nouns following them genitive. This class of adverbs was categor­
ized by traditional Arab grammarians as nouns because they can be preceded 
by prepositions, attach to the definite article  الـand be part of IDhaafa constructs 
(see Chapter 8). Definite nouns following them must end with one kasra;  
indefinite nouns must end with two kasras.

6.6 nterrog tive 
rti les أَدَواتُ االِسـْتـِفْـهام
Interrogative particles in Arabic are of two types: (1) a group that is used with 
nouns to form equational/nominal sentences, and (2) those that are used with 
verbs in verbal sentences.
Interrogative particles restricted in their use to nouns include “ ماwhat?” 
ُّ“ أَيwhich, he who (M),” and ُ“ أَيَّةshe who (F)”. Interrogative particles that 
appear before verbs include “ ماذاwhat?,” َّ“ مـِمfrom what?,” اذاِم“ لwhy, what 
for?,” َ“ لـِمwhy?.” Some of these particles are used with both nouns and verbs: 
“ مَنwho?,” ْ“ مِـمَّنfrom whom?,” ْ“ مَعَ مَنwith whom?,” َ“ أَيْنwhere?,” َ مِنْ أَيْن
“where from?,” َ“ إِىل أَيْنwhere to?,” َ“ كَيْفhow?,”“ كَمhow much, how many?,” 
“ بِكَ مfor how much?” Finally, ْ هَلor َ .أThe answer expected to questions begin­
ning with ْ هَلor َ أmust begin with yes or no.

Adverbs are parts of speech that modify verbs, adding information with respect 
to time or manner, or indicating intensity, limitation, or repetitiveness. Generally, 
adverbs are derived from several word categories: nouns or adjectives, or formed 
by the use of prepositions plus nouns. Chapter 6 presents elements that Arab 
grammarians classify as adverbs, although in fact they function like prepositions 
in causing nouns that follow them to be in the genitive case. Many adverbs are 
invariable in the accusative case, written with tanwiin. A few end with a Dhamma; 
a small number end in a kasra or a fat-Ha.
Adverbs are divided into three types: adverbs of time, adverbs of place, and 
adverbs of degree.
7.1 Adverbs of time ظُ روفُ الزَّمان
Adverbs and adverbial phrases of time indicate a particular action’s time of 
occurrence, duration, or sequence. Several categories belong to this group:
1.
Accusative nouns of units of time: Adverbs of time can be nouns denot­
ing units of time like ٌ“ ساعةhour,” ٌ“ يَوْمday,” ٌ“ أُسْ بوعweek,” “ شَ هْرmonth,” 
“ سَ نَةyear.” These time nouns, when used as adverbs, must always be  
indefinite and accusative, thus ending in tanwiin, as in the following  
examples:
.ًدَرَسَ ساعَة
He studied for an hour.
.ًأقامَ يف هذِهِ املَدينةِ سَ نَة
He resided a year in this city.

ًمَساءin the evening
ًأَحْ ياناsometimes
ًظُ هْراat noon
ًاراَهنday time

ًيَوْماsome day
ًلَيْالat night
ًأَبَداnever
ًفَجْ راat dawn
ًأخرياlately, finally
ًغَداtomorrow
The following examples illustrate the use of some of these adverbs in  
sentences:
.ًرَجَ عَ الـمُ عَلِّمُ صَ باحاThe teacher returned in the morning.
.ًاِجْ تَمَعَ مَعَنا لَيْالHe met with us at night.

ًحَ ديثاrecently
ًباكِراearly
ًحالِيّاpresently, now
ًمُتَأَخِّ راlate

Adverbs derived from ordinal numbers:
ًأَوَّالfirst, firstly
ًثالِثاthird, thirdly
ًثانِياsecond, secondly
ًرابِعاfourth, fourthly
4.
Prepositional phrases: this category consists of a preposition and a noun 
indicating time. Examples of prepositions include “ يفin, at” or َ قَبْل
“before,” or its diminutive form َ“ قُبَيْلa little bit before,” or َ“ بَعْدafter,” or 
its diminutive form َ“ بُعَيْدa little bit after.”
ِيف الصَّ باحin the morning
ِيف الفَجْ رat dawn
ِيف الـمَساءin the evening
ِيف الغَدtomorrow
ِيف الظُّ هْرat noon
ِيف العادَةusually
ِيف العَصin the late afternoon
ِيف الغالِبmostly
ِيف النَّهارduring day timeيف الـاميضin the past
ِيف اللَيْلat night
Such prepositional phrases expressing the time of actions in this section 
are synonymous with adverbs of time listed in the first category. For example, 
ِ يف  الصَّ باحis synonymous with ً صَ باحاand so on. The choice is personal 
preference and carries a certain register in the sense that ً صَ باحاcarries an 
educated speech register.
ٍقَبْلَ ساعَةan hour ago

Some adverbs of time in this category include, in addition to the preposi­
tional phrase, an adjective indicating a reference to past, present, or future 
times. Examine the following:

.َحينَام كانَ يف دِمَشْ ق، دَرَسَ العَرَبِيَّة
When he was in Damascus, he studied Arabic.
7.
A quantifier plus a noun indicating a reference to time: this structure forms 
the IDhaafa construct. As adverbial phrases, the first element of this con­
struct is in the accusative. The second element of this IDhaafa construct is 
in the genitive case see Chapter 8 .
ٍكُلَّ يَوْمevery day
ِغالِبَ األحْ يانmostly
ٍكُلَّ سَ نَةevery year

8.
A noun denoting time with the invariable suffix ٍ“ ئِذthat” attached to it. 
The noun is always in the accusative, as in the following:
ٍوَقتَئِذat that time
ٍيَوْمَئِذon that day
ٍحينَئِذthen
ٍبَعْدَئِذafter that
ٍعِنْدَئِذthen
ٍساعَتَئِذat that time, at that hour
ٍآنَئِذthen
The following sentence illustrates the use of these adverbs:
.ِدَرَّسَ صَ فَّ التّاريخِ وَبَعْدَئِذٍ رَجَ عَ إِىل بَيْتِه
He taught the history class and after that he returned home.
9.
A noun denoting time with َ“ ذاكthat,” a form of the demonstrative َ ذلِك
suffixed to the noun. The noun is always in the accusative, as in the  
following:
َآنَذاكthen, at that time
َوَقْتَذاكthen, at that time
َحينَذاكthen, at that time
َيَوْمَذاكthen, on that day
Examine the following sentence illustrating the use of such adverbs:
.ٍدَرَّسَ يف اجلامِعَةِ وَحينَذاكَ كانَ يَسْ كُ نُ يف بَيْتٍ كَبري
He taught at the university and then he lived in a big house.
7.2 Adverbs of 
l
e ظُ روف الـمَكان
This group of adverbs and prepositional phrases modifies a verb by indicating 
its location or direction. This includes words like ُ“ حَ يْثin the place where.” 
ُ حَ يْثalways ends with Dhamma, as the following sentence illustrates:
.ُسَ كَ نَ حَ يْثُ سَ كَ نَ أبوهHe resided where his father did.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
62
The following categories belong to this group:
1.
Words for directions like ٌْقَر“ شeast,” ٌ“ غَرْبwest,” ٌ“ جَ نوبsouth” and ٌ شَ امل
“north.” As adverbs, these are always indefinite, accusative, thus ending in tanwiin:
ًْقاَرشeastward
ًجَ نوباsouthward
ًغَرْباwestward
ًيَميناto the right
ًشَ امالnorthward
ًيَساراto the left
Examine the following sentence illustrating the use of such adverbs:
.ًْقاَرسارَ شHe walked eastward.
.ًمَشى شَ امالHe walked northward.
It is also possible to use prepositional phrases with the direction words as in
.ِمَشى إىل الشَّ املHe walked northward.
The use of ً شَ امالas a synonym conveys a speech register revealing a more 
educated usage.
2.
Words which are invariable in form, mostly ending with a fat-Ha. Note that 
a limited number end with a Dhamma or kasra. Nouns following them are 
always in the genitive case, ending with one kasra if the noun is definite, 
or with two kasras if it is indefinite:

. ِّجَ لَسَ ت األُسْ تاذَةُ أمامَ الصَّ فThe teacher sat in front of the class.
7.3 Adverbs of degree
These adverbs modify the verb by indicating its degree or extent. They include:
1.
Adverbs derived from adjectives. Masculine, indefinite, and accusative  
adjectives function as adverbs, for example ً“ كَثرياa lot,” ً“ قَليالa little,” ً بَعيدا
“distantly,” as in:
.ًأكَلَ كَثرياHe ate a lot.
.ًنامَ قَليالHe slept a little.
2.
Adverbs of degree denoting or delimiting intensity. Such adverbs include 
“ فَقَطonly,” ً“ جِ دّاvery, to a large extent,” ُّ“ قَطever, never,” ُ“ فَحَ سْ بonly,” 
and َ البَتَّةor ً“ بَتاتاdefinitely, absolutely.” ُّ قَطand َ البَتَّةor ً بَتاتاare used with 
past tense verbs often in the negative, or with jussive verbs. They are also 
in interrogative sentences. Consider the following examples:
. ُّما رَأَيْتُهُ قَطI never saw it/him.
هَلْ قابَلْتَها قَطّ ؟Have you ever met her?
.َْ أُدَخِّ ن يف حَ يايت البَتَّةَملI never smoked in my life.
3.
Prepositional phrases of degree:
ٍإِىل حَ دٍّ كَبريto a large extentبالضَّ بْطexactly
ٍإِىل حَ دِّ قَليلto a small extent
ِّعَىل األَقَلat least
ِلِلغايَةto a large extent, extremely
ِعَىل األَكْثَرat most

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

Consider the following examples:
.ٍأَحَ بَّتِ مَرْيم الـمَدينَةَ إِىل حَ دٍّ كَبري
Maryam liked the city a lot.
.ِْسَ ةُ طُ الّبٍ عىل األكْثرَمَ الصَّ فَّ خَرحَ ض
At most five students attended the class.
4.
Adverbs derived from maSdars. Prepositions like ِ“ بـby, by means of,”  عَىل
“on,” with indefinite nouns or maSdars see Chapter 25 on maSdars  function 
as adverbs modifying the manner of verbs. Examine the following:
.ٍعَةُرمَشى بِسHe walked in a hurry.
.ٍوَصَ لَ عَىل عَجَ لHe arrived in a hurry.
.ٍنامَتْ بِعُمْقShe slept deeply.
. ٍتَكَ لَّمَتْ بِوُضوحShe spoke clearly.
We must mention also other types of adverbs that will be discussed separately 
in this book, namely adverbs of specification, “tamyiiz” Chapter 33 , adverbs 
of manner that include adverbs of circumstance, “Haal” Chapter 32 , and 
the cognate accusative/object “al-maf cuul al-muTlaq” in the maSdar chapter 
Chapter 25 .
7.4 Pl
ement of 
dverbs
As a general rule, adverbs are often placed after the verb they modify, or as 
close to it as possible. This part of speech, however, enjoys a degree of mobility 
with respect to its position in sentences. Adverb mobility is used for stylistic 
variation, or to highlight and emphasize a certain element. To illustrate this 
statement, examine the following sentence:
.ِْطَ ةُّرْعَةٍ كَبريَةٍ اِنْطَ لَقَت سَ يّارَةُ الشُربِس
The police car set out at high speed.

Adverbs
65
The placement of ٍْعَةُر“ بِسat high speed, fast,” at the beginning of the sentence 
lends emphasis to how the car set out. Adverbial phrases such as ٍْعَةُر بِس
“at high speed,” can be modified by the use of adjectives as this example  
illustrates.
Adverbs of degree and time can be used in the same sentence, clearly 
modifying verbs in their different ways, as in the example below:
. ِدَرَسَ تِ الطّ الِبَةُ كثرياً أَمْس
The student F  studied a lot yesterday.

The IDhaafa-construct consists of nouns bound together into an indivisible unit, 
generally indicating either possession or that one entity is related to another. 
Two nouns in an IDhaafa-construct are used to express the relationship between 
two nouns, for example, X noun of Y [noun]. As an illustration, ِ صُ عودُ اجلَبَل
“mountain climbing” or ِ“ مُشاهَدَةُ الرِّياضَ ةsport watching” do not convey a sense 
of ownership, or possession, as does ِ“ كِتابُ الطّ الِبthe student’s book,” literally, 
“the book of the student.”
When nouns are used to form the IDhaafa-construct, the first noun indicates 
the possessed item, or the related item. The second indicates the possessor, or 
the entity to which another one is related. The IDhaafa-construct is generally 
formed by placing two nouns (in some cases adjectives, as we shall see in the 
Quasi- or Pseudo-IDhaafa section below) or more, in sequence. The second and 
any following nouns must always be in the genitive case. In Arabic, the first 
noun is called  مُضافmuDhaaf; the second ِ مُضاف إِلَيـْهmuDhaaf  ilayhi.
The IDhaafa-construct can also be formed by having a masculine or feminine 
adjective in the first position followed by a noun in the second position. This 
kind of construct is called in Arabic “ إِضافَة غَي حَ قيقِيَّةQuasi or Pseudo IDhaafa.” 
This will be discussed in a separate section below. There are certain conditions 
on each of the IDhaafa nouns to maintain grammaticality, correctness, as will 
be detailed below.
8.1 The Firs  Nou
 i
 IDhaafa
1.
The first noun in the IDhaafa-construct can never carry the definite article 
 .الْـIts definiteness is determined by the second or final noun of the construct. 
For example: ِ“ كِتابُ الطّ الِبthe student’s book,” literally, “the book of the 
student.”
2.
It can never carry nunation, the n-sound that marks indefinite nouns.

3.
The case of the first noun may vary, depending on its function in the  
sentence. If it is the subject of a sentence, the noun must be in the nominative 
case, as in the following example:
. ٌكِتابُ الطّ الِبِ جَ ديدThe student’s book is new.
Similarly, if the first noun is predicate, it must be in the nominative case, 
as in the following example:
. ِهذا هُ وَ كِتابُ الطّ الِبThis is the student’s book.
Or, if the first noun is the direct object of a transitive verb, it must bear 
only one fat-Ha, as in the following:
. ِقَرَأَْتُ كِتابَ الطّ الِبI read the student’s book.
Or, if it is governed by a preposition, it must end with only one kasra, as 
in the following:
. ِهذا يف كِتابِ الطّ الِبThis is in the student’s book.
4.
If the first noun in the IDhaafa is feminine, the taa’ marbuuTa at the end 
of the noun must be pronounced explicitly, as in:
.ٌسَ يّارَةُ الطّ الِبِ جَ ديدَةThe student’s car is new.
8.2 The se o

 IDhaafa
1.
The second noun in the IDhaafa-construct must always be in the genitive 
case.
2.
It can be a definite noun, marked by one kasra. This definite noun  
makes the first noun definite but without it having the definite article  .الـ
Thus, in ِ“ كِتابُ  األُستاذthe teacher’s book” the first noun  كِتابbecomes 
definite, although it cannot, and does not, carry the definite article. It is 
definite by virtue of the presence of the definite article  الْـin the second 
noun .األُستاذ

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

3.
It may be indefinite. In this case, the second noun must end with two  
kasras. The fact that the second noun is indefinite makes the whole IDhaafa-
construct indefinite, both nouns are unspecified. Consider:
ٍكِتابُ أُستاذlit. “a book of a professor” or  
“a professor’s book”
8.3 IDhaafa u

IDhaafa-constructs form a single indivisible nominal (“noun”) unit. Let us 
examine the construct ِ“ صَ ديقُ  الطّ الِبthe student’s friend,” to see how this  
indivisible unit can play the various functions of a single noun:
1.
Subject of equational sentence: مُبْتَدَأ
صَ ديقُ الطّ الِبِ أَمريكِيٌّ .The student’s friend is American.
2.
Predicate of equational sentence: خَ ب
هذا هُ وَ صَ ديقُ الطّ الِبِ .This is the student’s friend.
3.
Performer of an action of a verb: فاعِل
سافَرَ صَ ديقُ الطّ الِبِ إِىل لُبنان.The student’s friend traveled to Lebanon.
4.
Direct object of verb: ِمَفعول بِه
شاهَدْتُ صَ ديقَ الطّ الِبِ .I saw the student’s friend.
5.
Governed by a preposition: ْرورَججار وَم
سافَرَ مَعَ صَ ديقِ الطّ الِبِ .He traveled with the student’s friend.

A new development has taken place in Modern Standard Arabic where the 
first noun of an IDhaafa-construct is conjoined by another noun, or more in

some instances. This is perhaps becoming common due to translations from 
foreign languages, as in the following:
ِاتُ اجلامِعَةَرْتَبُخمَكْ تَبَةُ وَم
the library and laboratories of the university
ِمُوَظَّ فو وَأَساتِذَةُ وَطُ الّبُ اجلامِعَة
the employees, professors and students of the university
Traditional Arabic grammar does not sanction such structures. The preceding 
two IDhaafa structures are expressed, according to traditional grammar rules, 
in the following fashion:
اُهاتَرْتَبُخمَكْ تَبَةُ اجلامِعَةِ وَم
the university library and its laboratories
اُها وَطُ الّبُهمُوَظَّ فو اجلامِعَةِ وَأَساتِذَت

The preceding examples of the IDhaafa-construct are formed by two or more 
nouns. It is possible to form a type of IDhaafa by having a masculine or 
feminine adjective in the position of the first noun of an IDhaafa-construct, as 
in, for example: ِ“ طَ يِّبَةُ القَلْبِ / طَ يِّبُ القَلْبgood-hearted.”
1.
The case of the adjective can vary depending on its function in the sentence. 
The noun in the second position in this IDhaafa-construct must be definite. 
Examine the three sentences below:
.ِيلةُ الوَجْ هَموَصَ لَت ج
The beautiful-faced [woman] arrived.
.ِيلَةَ الوَجْ هَمقابَلْتُ أَمْسِ ج
I met the beautiful-faced [woman] yesterday.
.ِيلةِ الوَجْ هَمَ مَعَ جَرحَ ض
He came with the beautiful-faced [woman].

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

2.
The adjective IDhaafa-construct can function as an adjective. If the anteced-
ent noun is definite, the adjective must be definite, as in the following  
examples:
.ِِبُّ السَّ يّاراتِ اليابانِيَّةَ الصُّ نْعُحي
He likes Japanese-made cars.
.َِ ةْرتُغْرَسُ يف شَ وارِعِ املَدينَةِ األَشْ جارُ الدّائِمَةُ اخلُض
Evergreen trees are planted in the city streets.
On the other hand, if the antecedent is indefinite, the quasi-IDhaafa must 
begin with an indefinite adjective. Consider the following examples:
.ِيلَةُ الوَجْ هَمجاءَت اِمْرَأَةٌ ج
A woman with a beautiful face arrived.
.ِْطَ ةُ القَبْضَ عَىل قاتِلٍ كَثريِ اإلجْ رامُّرأَلقَت الش
The police arrested a perpetrator of many crimes.

Both nouns of an IDhaafa-construct may be modified by demonstrative pronouns 
and regular adjectives.
1.
Modification by demonstrative pronouns (see Chapter 5): Only a  
demonstrative pronoun can intervene between the first noun in IDhaafa-
constructs and the second. In this case, the demonstrative modifies the 
second noun in this structure. The modification of the second noun forms 
a single unit called the demonstrative phrase. Examine the following  
examples:
ِكِتابُ هذِهِ الطّ الِبَةlit. “the book of this student (F)”
ِأُستاذَةُ هذا الطّ الِبlit. “the teacher (F) of this student (M)”

The IDhaafa-construct
71
2.
The first noun in IDhaafa can also be modified by a demonstrative pronoun. 
However, it must be placed at the end of the IDhaafa-construct, as in the 
following examples:
كِتابُ الطّ الِبَةِ هذاthis book of the student (F)
ِأُستاذَةُ الطّ الِبِ هذِهthis teacher (F) of the student (M)
3.
Modifying an IDhaafa with regular adjectives:
As the two nouns in the IDhaafa-construct can only be split apart by a 
demonstrative pronoun, regular adjectives must occur at the end of the 
construct, as in the following:
. ٌكِتابُ الطّ الِبِ اجلَديدُ ضَ خْ مThe new book of the student is big.
Note that ُ اجلَديدin the preceding example carries the nominative marker 
functioning as modification of ُ .كِتابSince ُ كِتابis definite by virtue of the 
definite noun  الطّ الِبthe adjective for this noun must also be definite. To 
illustrate how important the case is in Arabic, compare the following examples:
. ٌكِتابُ الطّ الِب اجلَديدُ ضَ خْ مThe new book of the student is big.
. ٌكِتابُ الطّ الِبِ اجلَديدِ ضَ خْ مThe book of the new student is big.
It goes without saying that in spoken Arabic, the context plays a major role 
in eliminating ambiguity. Usually, interlocutors are aware of what they are 
talking about, and what adjectives go with what nouns. If interlocutors are 
not clear, clarification is requested. In written Arabic, however, the marking 
of case can remove ambiguity and facilitate communication.
4.
Suffixal possessive pronouns may attach to the second noun in an IDhaafa-
construct. Consider the following examples:
.هذا كِتابُ طالِبيThis is my student’s book.
. َهذا كِتابُ طالِبِكThis is your (M) student’s book.
Any adjective modifying  كِتابin the preceding examples must occur at the 
end of the IDhaafa-construct. In this case, the adjective must be in the 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
72
nominative case to agree with the noun it is modifying, as in the following 
example:
. ُهذا كِتابُ طالبي اجلَديدThis is my student’s new book.
Any adjective modifying  طالِبيmust be in the genitive case and also definite, 
as in the following:
.ِهذا كِتابُ طالِبي اجلَديدlit. “This is the book of my new student.”

An IDhaafa may consist of multiple nouns. As was mentioned, the placement 
of regular adjectives in any IDhaafa is restricted to the end of the construct. 
Sorting out which adjective applies to which noun can constrain processing of 
information as well as result in syntactically awkward structures. The solution 
to this grammatical clutter is to separate the nouns and their modifiers with 
the use of ِ .لـThe following sentence in which the two nouns forming IDhaafa 
are modified by two sequential adjectives verges on unacceptability:
ُِّ اجلَديدِيهذا كِتابُ األُستاذِ العَرَب
*This is the Arabic book of the new teacher.
Instead of stacking adjectives sequentially, as above, the language provides an 
alternative, simpler structure. The possessive preposition ِ“ لـfor, of, belonging 
to,” is used to convey the function of IDhaafa. A simpler, more common structure 
of the above sentence is expressed as follows:
.ُِّ لِألُستاذِ اجلَديدِيهذا الكِتابُ العَرَب
lit. “This Arabic book is for [belongs to] the new professor.”
8.7.1 Multiple noun IDhaafa and ِ لـconstruct
In theory, the number of nouns in this construct can be large. However, real 
language usage dictates that only a small number of nouns can be sequentially 

The IDhaafa-construct
73
allowed in IDhaafa. For example, the following four-noun string is easy to 
process, and, therefore, an acceptable utterance:
.هذا هُ وَ كِتابُ أُستاذِ جامِعَةِ القاهِرَة
4
3
2
1
lit. “This is the book of the professor of the University of Cairo.”
Similarly, the following five-noun IDhaafa string is acceptable, and the information 
can be processed relatively easily:
.هذا هُ وَ عُ نْوانُ كِتابِ أُستاذِ جامِعَةِ القاهِرَة
5
4
3
2
1
lit. “This is the title of the book of the professor of the  
  University of Cairo.”
If one continues expanding the string of nouns forming the IDhaafa-construct 
as in the previous examples, the processing of information eventually becomes 
constrained. It follows, therefore, that the major criterion for determining the 
number of nouns forming IDhaafa is the ability to process information with 
some facility.
Another factor that determines the number of nouns in IDhaafa is the place
ment of adjectives modifying the nouns in the construct. Examine the following:
. ُهذا هُ وَ عُ نْوانُ كِتابِ أُسْ تاذِ جامِعَةِ القاهِرَة اجلَديد
lit. “This is the new title of the book of the professor of the  
  University of Cairo.”
ُ“ اجلَديدthe new” in the preceding sentence modifies ُ“ عُ نْوانthe title,” as can 
be determined by the nominative case marker of both the noun and adjective, 
despite the rather extensive separation between the two elements. As adjectives 
tend to be placed in closer proximity to the nouns they modify, ِ لـprovides a 
simpler alternative to cumbersome an IDhaafa-constructs. The above sentence 
can be expressed more elegantly and more easily as follows:
.هذا هُ وَ العُنْوانُ اجلَديدُ لِكِتابِ أُستاذِ جامِعَةِ القاهِرَة
lit. “This is the new title of the book of the professor of the  
  University of Cairo.”

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
74
Thus, the use of the ِ لـconstruct becomes more expedient when more than  
one adjective is used to modify more than one noun in an IDhaafa-construct. 
Examine the following example:
.ِهذا هُ وَ العُنْوانُ اجلَديدُ لِكِتابِ أُستاذِ جامِعَةِ القاهِرَة اجلديد
This is the new title of the new book of the professor of the  
  University of Cairo.
The adjective  اجلَديدin the IDhaafa component ِ .لِكِتابِ أُستاذِ جامِعَةِ القاهِرَة اجلديد
is ambiguous. The masculine adjective ِ[“ اجلَديدthe] new,” in the genitive case, 
could, in fact, modify either ِ“ كِتابbook” or ِ“ أُسْ تاذprofessor,” as both masculine 
nouns are in the genitive case. However, interlocutors involved in such a  
discourse know whether the discussion is about “the new book” or “the new 
professor.” In other words, the pragmatics of the discourse eliminate such 
ambiguity.
8.8 
se o  ْ مِنi
s e d o  ِلـ
In some instances, the preposition “ مِنfrom, of” is used instead of ِ .لـExamine 
the following examples:
.ِكَةُ اجليلَ اجلَديدَ مِنْ سَ يّاراتِ تويوتاَّرأَصْ دَرَتِ الش
The company produced the new model of Toyota cars.

 غَي
The negative noun ُ ْر غَيcan be used in forming IDhaafa-constructs to produce 
the meaning of “non-,” “not,” or “without.” ُ ْر غَيremains invariable with respect 
to gender. Its case can vary depending on its function. It can be followed by a 
noun, pronoun, ’ism faacil “active participle,”’ism maf cuul “passive participle,” 
or adjective. Additionally, it can be preceded by a preposition, thus causing it 
to be put into the genitive case. Consider the following:

8.9.1  غَيwith nouns
The noun following  غَيmust always be in the genitive. Examine the following 
examples:
.ُِ الطُّ الّبِ إِىل الـمَدينَةْروَفَدَ الطُّ الّبُ وَغَي
Students and non-students flocked to the city.
.َِ اجلُبْنَةْريَأْكُلونَ اجلُبْنَةَ وَغَي
They eat cheese and [foods] other than cheese.
. ِِ السَّ يّاراتْريَنْتَقِلُ احلُجّ اجُ بِالسَّ يّاراتِ وَغَي
The pilgrims travel in cars and other means of transportation.
Note that ُ ْر غَيin the preceding examples agrees with the case of the noun to 
which it is conjoined.
8.9.2 ُ ْر غَيwith pronouns
The nouns following  غَيin the preceding section can be replaced by the  
appropriate pronoun to produce the meaning of “other than,” as in the following:
.ُِهُ م إِىل الـمَدينَةْروَفَدَ الطُّ الّبُ وَغَي
Students and others [other than them] flocked to the city.
.َهاْريَأْكلونَ اجلُبْنَةَ وَغَي

.ِهاْريَنْتَقِلُ احلُجّ اجُ بالسَّ يّاراتِ وغَي

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
76
8.9.3  غَيwith adjectives
 غَيcan function as a negative particle of adjectives to produce the meaning of 
“not” or “un-.” As a first term in an IDhaafa-construct, the adjective following 
it must always be in the genitive case. Examine the following examples:
ٍُ بَعيدْرغَيnot far
ٍُ صَ عْبَةْرغَيnot difficult
ٍُّ أَمريكِيْرغَيun-American
The preceding can also be expressed by the use of َ ,لَيْسconveying the same 
meaning:
ًلَيْسَ بَعيدا
لَيْسَ صَ عْباً
لَيْسَ أَمْريكِيّاً
The following sentences illustrate ُ ْر غَيwith adjectives:
.ُ بَعيدٍ مِنْ هُ ناْراملَطْ عَمُ غَي
The restaurant is not far from here.
.ٍَ حَ كيمْريَقولُ هذا الرَّجُ لُ قَوْالً غَي
This man says an unwise thing.
.َِ الصَّ عْبَةْرناقَشَ الوزيرُ املَسائِلَ الصَّ عْبَةَ وَغَي
The minister discussed the difficult and not difficult issues.
Note that in the first sentence the phrase beginning with  غَيis in the nominative, 
functioning as the predicate of the sentence. In the second sentence, the phrase 
beginning with  غَيis an adjective of the direct object ً ,قَوْالwhich explains why 
 غَيis in the accusative.  غَيin the third sentence is conjoined to the  
direct object and its adjective َ ,املَسائِلَ  الصَّ عْبَةwhich explains why  غَيis in  
the accusative case.

The IDhaafa-construct
77
8.9.4  غَيafter prepositions
 غَيcan attach to a preposition such as ِ بـor be preceded by  ,مِنconveying the 
meaning of “without,” or “other than,” as in the following:
.ٍِ سُ كَّ رْرَبُ القَهْوَةَ مِنْ غَيْريَش
He drinks coffee without sugar.
.ِ أفكارِهِمْرواجَ هَ خُ صُ ومَهُ بِغَي
He faced his adversaries with ideas other than theirs.
8.9.5  غَيwith the definite article
 غَيcan support the prefixing of the definite article  الـin limited usages. This 
is frowned upon by purists who consider this structure ungrammatical. One 
may, however, encounter examples like the following in the press, or other 
media:
.َِ عَىل نَفْسِهْريُفَضِّ لُ الغَي
He places others before himself.
.ِ ْرتُسَ بِّبُ الضَّ وْضاءُ اإلِزْعاجَ لِلْغَي
Loud noise causes disturbance to others.
8.9.6 ُ ْر ال غَيand ُ ْرلَيْسَ غَي
Thus far,  غَيhas been shown to behave as a declinable noun showing  
three cases: the nominative, accusative and genitive. ُ ْر غَيcan be preceded  
by the negative particles  الor َ لَيْسto function as an adverb in the sense of 
“only.” In this case, it must always be in the nominative, as in the following 
examples:
.ُ ْرَ بُ القَهْوَةَ ال غَيْرأَش
I only drink coffee.
.ُ ْرأُريدُ فَقَط هذا الكِتابَ لَيْسَ غَي
I want only this book, not any other.

elements will be detailed in Chapter 34. Furthermore, the quantifiers ّ“ كُلall

The equational sentence  اجلُمْلَة االِسْ مِيَّةis a basic sentence structure in Arabic 
and expresses propositions in the present tense. Young children first learn such 
utterances when speaking stretches longer than a single word. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that learners of Arabic as a foreign language are introduced to this 
structure first.
The basic equational sentence in Arabic consists of two components: mubtada’ 
“ مُبْتَدَأsubject,” often placed at the beginning of the sentence, and khabar  خَ ب
“predicate,” the element that states something about the subject. Both the 
subject and predicate are governed by rules to maintain sentence acceptability.
Unlike English or other European languages, equational sentences in Arabic 
are constructed without the verb “to be” in the present tense. The absence of 
the verb “to be” is not unique to Arabic, however; other languages, such as 
Russian and Hebrew share this feature as well. We present below several patterns 
in which the equational sentence is constructed:
9.1 Personal 
ronouns as subjects
Personal pronouns can act as subjects of equational sentences with proper 
nouns, common nouns, adjectives and prepositional phrases as their predicates. 
(See Chapter 5 for discussion of personal pronouns.)
9.1.1 Personal pronouns (as subjects) + proper nouns 
(as predicates)
Singular:
.َدْمأَنا أَحI am Ahmad.
.هِيَ مَرْيَمShe is Maryam.
.أَنْتِ لَيْلYou are Leila.

.هُ م عيل وسَ لمى ومَرْيَمThey are Ali, Salma and Maryam.
.َى وَسِ هامْرهُ نَّ فاطِمَة وَيُسThey are Fatima, Yusra and Siham.
9.1.2 Personal pronouns + common nouns
The predicate must agree with the subject pronoun in gender and number. The 
predicate noun must be indefinite, hence the two Dhammas at its end.
Singular:
. ٌأَنا طالِبI am a student.
.ٌهُ وَ أُسْ تاذHe is a teacher.
.ٌهِيَ مُعَلِّمَةShe is a teacher.
Dual:
Predicate nouns of sentences containing dual pronouns (or nouns) as subjects must 
be dual, indefinite and nominative, and must agree with the subject in gender.
.أَنْتُام مُعَلِّمَتانYou are teachers (F).
.ِا طالِبَتانُمهThey are students (F).
.ِا مُعَلِّامنُمهThey are teachers (M).
.ِنَحْ نُ مُوَظَّ فانWe (D, M) are employees.

Plural:
Predicate nouns of sentences containing plural pronouns or nouns as subjects 
must be plural, indefinite and nominative. Predicate nouns must also agree 
with the subject in gender.
. ٌنَحْ نُ طُ الّبWe are students.
. ٌهُ نَّ مُعَلِّامتThey (F) are teachers.
9.1.3 Personal pronouns + adjectives
Adjective predicates must be nominative. In addition, they must agree with the 
subject in number and gender, as in the following:
Singular:
. ٌهُ وَ جَ ديدHe is new.
.ٌهِيَ مَشْ هورَةShe is famous.
Dual:
.ِيلَتانَما جُمهThey (F) are beautiful.
.ِا مَشْ هورانُمهThey (M) are famous.
هَلْ أَنْتُام مَغْرِبِيّانِ؟Are you (M) Moroccan?

9.1.4 Proper nouns or personal pronouns + prepositional 
phrases or adverbs
Nouns following prepositions end with one kasra if they are definite, and with 
two kasras if they are indefinite. Proper nouns like “ واشِ نْطُ نWashington” are 
not marked for case.
Singular:
. ِأَنا يف البَيْتI am in the house.
.ِهِي يف اجلامِعَةShe is at the university.

9.2 Demonstrative Pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns can function both as subjects of equational sentences 
and as modifiers of nouns in the subject position. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion 
of demonstrative pronouns.) They can also follow prepositions, as in  وَمِثالٌ عىل
“ هذاand an example of this,” َ“ وَمِثالٌ عىل ذلِكand an example of that,” etc.
9.2.1 Demonstrative pronouns + proper nouns
In Modern Standard Arabic, proper nouns in the predicate position, as well as 
in the subject position, are often used without the nominative case marker.
Singular:
.ْمودَحهذا مThis is Mahmoud.
.هذِهِ سَ مريَةThis is Samira.
Dual:
.مودَحَد وَمْمهذانِ أَحThese are Ahmad and Mahmoud.
.هاتانِ فِرْدَوْس وَسُ وزانThese are Firdaws and Suzanne.
Plural:
.أُولئِكَ لَيْل وَسامِيَة وَهادِيَةThose are Leila, Samia and Hadia.
.هؤُالءِ عَدْنان وَلَيْل وَزَيْنَبThese are Adnan, Leila and Zainab.
9.2.2 Demonstrative pronouns with common nouns as 
predicates
When the subjects of equational sentences are demonstrative pronouns, the predicate 
must be indefinite and agree in gender and number, as in the following examples:
Singular:
.ٌهذِهِ أُسْ تاذَةThis (F) is a teacher (F).
. ٌهذا كِتابThis (M) is a book (M).

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
84
Dual:
.ِهذانِ طالِبانThese (M) are students.
.هاتانِ مُعَلِّمَتانThese (F) are teachers.
Plural:
. َهؤُالءِ مُدَرِّسونThese are teachers (M).
. ٌاولئِكَ مُوَظَّ فاتThose are employees (F).
9.2.3 Demonstrative pronouns modifying subjects of 
equational sentences
If the noun following the demonstrative is definite, the construct is not a  
sentence. Thus ُ هذا الكِتابis equivalent to “this book” in English. To turn such 
a structure into a sentence, a third person pronoun must be inserted between 
the subject and the definite noun to form a predicate and an equational  
sentence. This intervening pronoun, known in Arabic as “ ضَ مري  الفَصْ لthe 
pronoun of separation,” must agree with the demonstrative subject in number 
and gender. Compare the following pairs in which the first is a phrase, the 
second a sentence:
Singular:
ُهذا الطّ الِبthis student (M)
. ُهذا هُ وَ الطّ الِبThis is the student (M).
ُهذِهِ اجلَريدَةthis newspaper
.ُهذِهِ هِيَ اجلَريدَةThis is the newspaper (F).
Dual:
ِهاتانِ البِنْتانthese girls
.ِا البِنْتانُمهاتانِ هThese are the girls.

The Equational Sentence
85
Plural:
َهؤُالءِ املُعَلِّمونthese teachers
. َهؤُالءِ هُ مُ املُعَلِّمونThese are the teachers (M).
9.3 
ommon nouns as subjects
A common noun beginning equational sentences in Arabic must be definite, by 
having either a definite article  ,الـa possessive pronoun suffix such as “ يmy,” 
“ هاher,” for example, or the first noun of an IDhaafa-construct whose terminal 
noun is definite, as in ِِكَةَّر“ مُديرُ الشthe company’s manager.” (See Chapter 2 
for a discussion of determination of nouns.) Consider the following examples:
.ِىل الطاوِلَةَالكِتابُ عThe book is on the table.
.ِىل الطاوِلَةَكِتايب عMy book is on the table.
.ِىل الطاوِلَةَكِتابُ املُعَلِّمِ عThe teacher’s book is on the table.
9.3.1 Common nouns + prepositional phrases or adverbs
Singular:
. ِاألُسْ تاذُ يف البَيْتThe teacher (M) is in the house.
. ِّالطالِبُ يف الصَّ فThe student (M) is in the classroom.
Dual:
.الطّ الِبانِ مِنَ املَغْرِبThe students (M) are from Morocco.
. ِّالكُ رْسِ يّانِ أَمامَ الصِّ فThe chairs (M) are at the front of the classroom.
.املَدينَتانِ يف مِصThe cities (F) are in Egypt.
Plural:
. ِالطُّ الّبُ يف الصُّ فوفThe students (M/F) are in the classrooms.
.الـمُ وَظَّ فونَ يف مَكاتِبِهِمThe employees (M/F) are in their offices.
. ِّاملُعَلِّمونَ خارِجَ الصَّ فThe teachers (M/F) are outside the classroom.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
86
9.3.2 Common nouns + adjectives
Regardless of the number of the subject, the predicate adjective must be in the 
nominative, indefinite, and it must agree with the subject in gender and number.
Singular:
. ٌيلَمبَيْتُكِ جYour (F, Sg) house is beautiful.
.ٌيلَةَمسَ يّارَتُكَ جYour (M) car is beautiful.
Dual:
.ِيلَتانَمالصَّ ديقَتانِ جThe two friends (F) are beautiful.
.ِالكِتابانِ مـُمْتِـعانThe two books (M) are enjoyable.
Plural:
Note that irregular plural nouns can be human or non-human. Adjectives used 
with human nouns must agree with the nouns they modify in number and 
gender. Furthermore, they must agree in case.
. َالـمُ وَظَّ فونَ نَشيطونThe employees are energetic.
. ٌالطّ الِباتُ عِراقِيّاتThe students (F) are Iraqis.
Adjectives used with non-human plural nouns, on the other hand, must be in 
the feminine singular. Examine the following:
.ٌالكُ تُبُ جَ ديدَةThe books are new.
.ٌيلَةَمالـمُ دُ نُ جThe cities are beautiful.
Non-human plural nouns are treated grammatically in all facets of the language 
as feminine singular.
9.4 
ubject– re icate inversion
Subjects usually occur at the beginning of equational sentences and are followed 
by their predicates. There are instances, however, when the subject and predicate 

The Equational Sentence
87
of the equational sentence switch positions. This can be called either subject–
predicate inversion or a fronted predicate. This condition occurs in two cases:
(a) When using the interrogative particles  أَدَواتُ االِسْ تِفْهامat the beginning of 
the sentence, and
(b) when using prepositional or adverbial phrases at the beginning of the  
sentence.
9.4.1 Interrogative particles
Interrogative particles in Arabic occur at the beginnings of sentences, thus 
causing the inversion of subject and predicate. The inverted subject could be  
a personal pronoun, a demonstrative pronoun, or a proper noun. These  
possibilities are illustrated with the interrogative particle “ مَنwho” below:
مَنْ أَنْتَ ؟Who are you?
مَنْ هُ وَ؟Who is he?
ا؟ُممَنْ هWho are they (M/F, D)?
مَنْ أَنْتُم؟Who are you (M, Pl)?
Or:
A demonstrative pronoun, which remains unchanged, as in the following  
examples:
مَنْ ذلِكَ ؟Who is that (M)?
مَنْ تِلْكَ ؟Who is that (F)?
مَنْ هذانِ؟Who are these (M, D)?
مَنْ هؤُالءِ؟Who are these (M/F, Pl)?
Or:
A nominative definite common noun. In the singular, the noun ends with one 
Dhamma. If the noun is in the dual, the noun ends with ِ .انRegular masculine 
plural nouns end with َون-. Irregular plural nouns end with one Dhamma. 
Regular feminine plural nouns end with only one Dhamma.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
88
Inverted subjects could be definite when prefixed by the definite article ْ الـ
or by a possessive pronoun, or by an IDhaafa-construct. Consider the following 
examples:
Singular:
مَنِ األُسْ تاذَةُ؟Who is the teacher (F)?
مَنِ الطّ الِبُ ؟Who is the student?
مَنْ صَ ديقُهُ؟Who is his friend?
مَنْ مُديرُ املَكْ تَبِ ؟Who is the office manager?
Dual:
مَنِ الـمُ ديرَتانِ؟Who are the directors (F, D)?
مَنِ الصَّ ديقانِ؟Who are the friends (M, D)?
Plural:
مَنِ الـمُ وَظَّ فونَ ؟Who are the employees (M, Pl)?
مَنِ الـمُ وَظَّ فاتُ ؟Who are the employees (F, Pl)?
Note that the definite article in the non-initial position loses the hamza sound, 
thus creating the possibility of having three consonants in a row. To avoid this 
possibility, a kasra is inserted at the end of ْ مَنin the previous examples that 
begin with the definite article ْ.الـ
9.4.1.1 “ ماWhat?”
This particle is commonly used with the demonstrative pronouns ،ِ هذا،  هذِه
 ،ذلِكَor َ .تِلْكUnlike ْ مَنmentioned above,  ماgenerally solicits information 
about non-human entities, as in the following examples:
ما هذا؟What is this?
ما هذِهِ؟What is this/are those?
ما هذانِ؟What are those (M, D)?

The Equational Sentence
89
Since  ماhas a definitional function, the predicates of sentences in answers to 
questions having  ماtend to be indefinite. Note again that the use of  ,ماunlike 
 ,مَنis restricted to non-human entities. As a reminder, non-human plural entities 
are treated as feminine singular nouns. In answer to the second question, ِ هذِه
can conceivably refer to “books,” “tables,” or some other non-human plural 
noun, as in the following:
ما هذِهِ الكُ تُبُ ؟What are these books?
9.4.1.2 َ“ أَيْنWhere?”
This particle inquires about the location of an entity, a person or a thing.  
Examine the following sentences:
أَيْنَ هُ وَ؟Where is he?
أَيْنَ الطالِبُ ؟Where is the student?
ا؟ُمأَيْنَ هWhere are they (M/F, D)?
أَيْنَ هُ نَّ ؟Where are they (F, Pl)?
أَيْنَ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ ؟Where are the teachers (M, Pl)?
Predicates in answers to such questions must be prepositional phrases comprising 
a preposition indicating location or place, followed by a noun. The following 
prepositions “ يفin” and “ عَلon” indicate location. There are adverbs like َ أمام
“in front of,” ِ“ بِجانِبto the side of,” and a few others that can answer ques-
tions with َ .أَيْنNote that nouns following prepositions or adverbs must end 
with one kasra if the noun is definite, or with two kasras if it is indefinite.
9.4.1.3 َ“ مِنْ أَيْنWhere from?” or “from where?”
In an equational sentence this particle inquires about where the person or 
entity in question is from. The inverted subject in this case can be a pronoun, 
a proper noun, or a common noun, as in the following examples:
مِنْ أَيْنَ هُ وَ؟Where is he from?
مِنْ أَيْنَ سُ لَيْامن؟Where is Sulaiman from?

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
90
مِنْ أَيْنَ األُسْ تاذُ؟Where is the teacher from?
ا؟ُممِنْ أَيْنَ هWhere are they (M/F, D) from?
مِنْ أَيْنَ هؤُالءِ؟Where are these (M/F, Pl) from?
Note that the common noun in the third sentence is in the definite and  
nominative. An indefinite noun would result in an ungrammatical sentence. 
The reason for this is perhaps that the entity in question is known to both 
interlocutors. We should also mention that as a question word, َ مِن أَيْنcan also 
be used with verbs, as in, for example:
ىل الـاملِ؟َمِنْ أَيْنَ حَ صلوا عWhere did they get the money from?
Answers to questions with َ مِنْ أَيْنmust always have ْ ,مِنin addition to a place 
or location, as in the following:
مِنْ أَيْنَ أَنْتَ ؟Where are you from?
.أَنا مِن سورياI’m from Syria.
9.4.1.4 َ“ كَيْفHow?”
This particle solicits information about a condition, or how someone or some-
thing is. It can be followed by a proper noun or a common noun. If the noun 
following َ كَيْفis a common noun, it must be both definite and nominative, as 
in the following examples:
كَيْفَ مَرْيـَم؟How is Maryam?
كَيْفَ احلالُ ؟How are you? (lit. “How is the condition?”)
كَيْفَ الطَّ قْسُ ؟How is the weather?
كَيْفَ الطُّ الّبُ ؟How are the students?
 كَيْفcan also be followed by an independent pronoun, as in the following:
كَيْفَ هِيَ ؟How is she?
كَيْفَ أَنتِ ؟How are you (F)?
كَيْفَ هُ مْ ؟How are they (M, Pl)?

The Equational Sentence
91
As with َ مِن أَيْنabove, َ كَيْفcan also be followed by verbs as in the following 
examples:
كَيـْفَ وَصَ لْتَ إِىل هُ نا؟How did you arrive here?
ىل هذا الكِتابِ ؟َكَيْفَ حَ صَ لْتَ عHow did you obtain this book?
9.4.2 Prepositional or adverbial phrases
Subject–predicate inversion also occurs when using prepositional or adverbial 
phrases indicating location, possession, or ownership. The subject must be 
indefinite and nominative. Examine the following example:
.ٌيف السَّ يّارَةِ حَ قيبَةThere is a bag in the car.
Note that subjects of equational sentences in initial position must always start 
with a known entity, i.e., definite. Contrast the preceding sentence in which 
the subject is in the indefinite with the following, where the subject is definite:
.ِاحلَقيبَةُ يف السَّ يّارَةThe bag is in the car.
9.4.2.1 Prepositional phrases ٌْرورَججارٌّ وَم
1.
The prepositions “ يفin” and ىلَ“ عon” indicate location, as in the following 
examples:
.ٌىل الطّ اوِلَةِ وَرَقَةَعThere is a paper on the table.
. ٌيف البَيْتِ كِتابThere is a book in the house.
. ٌيف الـمُ دُ نِ مَكْ تَباتThere are libraries (bookshops) in cities.
.ِِ سَ يّارَتانْنيف البَيْتَيThere are cars (D) in the houses (D).
2. لَـindicates possession in the sense of “for” or “to,” and attaches to suffix 
pronouns only, as in the following example:
. ٌلَنا مُدَرِّساتٌ مَشْ هوراتWe have famous instructors (F, Pl).

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
92
This preposition also has the variant ِ لـwhich attaches to proper or common 
nouns, as in the following:
. ٌلِعَيل بَيْتAli has a house.
.ِلِلطّ الِبَـيـْنِ صَ ديقانThe students (M, D) have friends (M, D).
3.
The preposition َ“ مَعwith” indicates possession, and also accompaniment. 
Examine the following example:
. ٌمَعي كِتابI have a book. (lit. “A book is with me.”)
. ِمَعي أَصْ دِقاءُ يف البَيْتI have friends in the house.
.ِمَعي جَ ريدَتانI have two newspapers.
9.4.2.2 Adverbial phrases الظروف
Arab grammarians classify a group of words indicating location as  ظُ روف مَكان
“adverbs of place.” This group includes َ“ أَمامin front of,” َ“ وَراءbehind, at the 
back of,” َ“ خَ لْفbehind, at the back of,” ِ“ بِجانِبbeside, to the side of,” َ عِنْد
“at, with,” َ“ فَوْقover,” َْتَح“ تunder,” etc.
Nouns following prepositions or “ ظُ روفadverbs” must be in the genitive 
case, as in the following examples:
.ٌأَمامَ البَيْتِ مَكْ تَبَةThere is a bookstore/library in front of the house.
. ٌعِنْدَ األُسْ تاذِ كِتابThe professor has a book.
.ٌخَ لْفَ الـمَكْ تَبَةِ بِناءٌ كَبريThere is a big building behind the library.
9.5 
o ifying subjects an  
re icates الصِّ فات
When the subject of the equational sentence is a common noun, it is possible to 
provide additional information about this noun. This can be done in several ways. 
In this section, we shall discuss only two of these: adjectives and prepositions.
9.5.1 Modifying subjects by adjectives
Adjectives add extra information in the form of epithets, attributes or descriptions. 
This process is subject to several restrictions. Adjectives modifying subject nouns 

The Equational Sentence
93
must be definite and nominative. In addition, they must agree with nouns in 
gender and number. If the subject is feminine, the adjective must also be 
feminine, and vice versa. Examine the following sentences:
. ِالطالِبُ اجلَديدُ يف البَيْت
The new student (M) is in the house.
.األُستاذَةُ اجلَميلَةُ مِنَ العِراق
The beautiful teacher (F) is from Iraq.
.الطّ الِبَتانِ الطّ ويلَتانِ مِنْ أمريكا
The tall students (F, D) are from America.
.ٍىل جائِزَةَاملُدَرِّسونَ املَشْ هورونَ حَ صلوا ع
The famous instructors (M, Pl) won a prize.
Note that the adjectives in the above examples agree with their subjects in deter
mination (definiteness/indefiniteness), case (nominative), number and gender.
If the subject is a non-human plural, the adjective must be feminine singular, 
as in the following example. (See Chapter 2, section 2.1 for discussion of non-
human plurals.)
. ِالسَّ يّاراتُ اجلَديدَةُ وَصَ لَت أَمْسThe new cars arrived yesterday.
A legitimate question can be raised: how many adjectives can be combined to 
modify a particular noun? The answer to this question is not clear-cut. In 
theory, there is no limit to the number. However, if too many adjectives are 
stacked up it presents processing problems to the reader or listener. Generally, 
it would be safe to state that two to three consecutive adjectives following a 
noun will be tolerated, as in the following examples:
.األُسْ تاذَةُ اجلَميلةُ الطويلَةُ مِن املَغرِب
2
1
The tall, beautiful teacher is from Morocco.
.الطالِبُ األَمْريكيُّ اجلَديدُ مِنْ كاليفورنيا
2
1
The new American student is from California.
.الطّ الِبُ األَمريكِيُّ اجلَديدُ الطَّ ويلُ مِن كاليفورنيا
3
2
1
The tall, new American student is from California.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
94
If more than two or three adjectives are used, there is a tendency to conjoin 
adjectives by the conjunctive particle  .وExamine the example below:
.الطالِبُ األَمريكيُّ اجلَديدُ واجلَميلُ مِن كاليفورنيا
The new, handsome American student is from California.
(Note that  وattaches to the word following it in the writing system.)
Nouns with possessive pronoun suffixes are definite by virtue of the  
possessive suffixes attached to them. Adjectives modifying such subjects must 
be definite and also nominative. Examine the following examples:
.ِىل الطّ اولةَكِتايب اجلَديدُ عMy new book is on the table.
. ِا اجلَديدَةُ يف البَيْتُهسَ يّارَتHer new car is at home.
9.5.2 Modifying predicates by adjectives
Nouns functioning as predicates of equational sentences can also be modified 
by adjectives or prepositional/adverbial phrases. Recall that adjectives must exactly 
mirror the noun in four features: determination; number; case; and gender.
The conditions of subject modification illustrated in the previous section 
can be generalized to apply to predicate modification. In other words, the 
number of adjectives used to modify a predicate noun should be limited. If 
more adjectives are used, the conjoining particle  وwill be used to conjoin these 
adjectives, as in the following examples:
.ٌْتازُمروبَرْت طالِبٌ أَمْريكِيٌّ جَ ديدٌ وم
Robert is a new and excellent American student.
.ٌيلَةَمهذِهِ طالِبَةٌ أَمريكيَّةٌ جَ ديدَةٌ وج
This is a new, beautiful American student (F).
.ِْتِعانُمهذانِ كِتابانِ جَ ديدانِ م
These are new, interesting books (D).
.ِيّاتٌ مَشْ هوراتٌ ومُدَرَّباتٌ يف أمريكاْرهؤُالءِ مُدَرِّساتٌ مِص
These are famous Egyptian teachers (F, Pl) and well-trained in  
America.

The Equational Sentence
95
Nouns with possessive pronoun suffixes functioning as predicates can also  
be modified by adjectives. Since these nouns are definite by virtue of the  
possessive suffixes attached to them, adjectives modifying such predicates must 
also be definite. Examine the following examples:
. ُهذا كِتايب اجلَديدThis is my new book.
.ُا القَديمَةُههذِهِ سَ يّارَتThis is her old car.
.ُاآلنِسَ ةُ بْراوْن مُديرَتُنا اجلَديدَةMiss Brown is our new director.
Note that the adjectives in the above sentences are definite because the nouns 
they modify are definite by virtue of the possessive pronouns attached to the 
predicate nouns. Also, note that the adjectives in these sentences are in the 
nominative because of the case of the nouns they modify.
9.6 هَل
 هَلis used to solicit confirmation about the truth value of the proposition in 
question, i.e. whether the information in the sentence is true or not.
Technically,  هَلis not like the preceding interrogative particles. It does not 
cause the inversion of subject and predicate. Sentences containing  هَلmaintain 
their normal order, i.e., the subject initiates the sentence and the predicate  
occupies the second position. The placement of  هَلmust be directly in front 
of the subject. Examine the following examples:
هَلْ هُ وَ طالِبٌ ؟Is he a student?
هَلْ هُ مْ أَمْريكِيّونَ ؟Are they (M, Pl) Americans?
هَلْ أَنْـتُـنَّ طالِباتٌ ؟Are you (F, Pl) students?
The questions in these examples require either a “ نَعَمyes” or “ الno” response.
9.7 
ategorical negation ال النّافِيَة للجِ نْس
 الnegates the existence of entities in absolute terms. It is followed by inde
finite nouns or maSdars in the accusative without tanwiin. In equational 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
96
sentences, the predicate, noun or adjective, must be in the nominative, as in 
the following:
. ٌال طالِبَ نائِمNo student is asleep.
If a regular feminine plural noun follows  ,الa kasra terminates the noun, as in 
the following:
.َْ نَ اليَوْمَرال مُعَلِّامتِ حَ ضNo teachers came today.
Some grammarians tolerate the use of a fat-Ha to terminate a regular feminine 
plural. The preceding sentences can appear as follows:
.َْ نَ اليَوْمَرال مُعَلِّامتَ حَ ضNo teachers came today.
.ِال سَ يّاراتَ يف الشَّ وارِعThere are no cars on the streets.
This negative particle forms certain sentential expressions commonly used in 
discourse, as in the following:
! َال بَأْسَ عَلَيْكNo harm will befall you.
!ِ ّهال حَ وْلَ وال قُوَّةَ إِالّ بِاللThere is no power or might save in God.
.ال شَ كَّ يف ذَلِكThere is no doubt in that.
Expressions such as the following are used to introduce sentences, as illustrated 
below:
ال بُدَّ مِنIt is absolutely necessary that
َّال غَرْوَ أَنThere is no wondering that
!ّال بُدَّ مِن العَمَلِ اجلادSerious work is necessary!
. ِال غَرْوَ أَنَّ احلَرْبَ سَ بَّبَت خَ سائِرَ يف األرْواحThere is no question that the war  
  caused the loss of many lives.
Equational sentences are negated by the use of the negative particle َ ,لَيْسwhich 
will be discussed in detail in Chapter 10.

There is a small group of verbs in Arabic that are used with equational sentences 
to express meanings related to being, becoming or their negation. Traditional 
Arabic grammarians labeled this group “ أَفعال ناقِصَ ةincomplete or defective verbs,” 
primarily because of their form. Their use is restricted to certain domains. A 
commonly used member of this group is the verb َ“ كانto be,” which is employed 
in equational sentences to state a proposition in the past tense. It can also be 
used to form the future tense. Arab grammarians call these verbs  كانَ وَأَخَ واتهُ ا
“kaana and its sisters.” The name assigned to this group as sisters is premised 
on the identical behavior that these verbs exhibit when used in equational/
nominal sentences. The most striking grammatical feature of َ كانand its sisters 
is that they turn common nouns and adjectives functioning as predicates into the 
accusative case. َ كانis used with verbs in the present tense to express an action 
that happened at a point of time in the past (see Chapter 18 on past continuous).
In the following list, we present these verbs in the past and present tenses 
for the third person singular pronoun َوُ .هOut of the list, all but َ لَيْسexhibit a 
present tense form:
ُكانَ / يَكونto beـمْيسُأَمْسى / يto become
َلَيْسis not
ُباتَ / يَبيتto become
ُصارَ / يَصريto become
ُما زالَ / ال يَزالto remain, still is
ُصْ بِحُأَصْ بَحَ / يto become
ُّظَ لَّ / يَظَ لto remain
ضْ حيُأَضْ حى / يto become
We should note that some of these verbs etymologically pertain to different 
times of day. For example, ُصْ بِحُ“ أَصْ بَحَ / يto become” pertains to “ صَ باحmorning;” 
CHAPTER 10
Kaana and its sisters كانَ وَأَخَ واتهُ ا

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
98
ـمْيسُ“ أَمْسى  /  يto become” pertains to “ مَساءevening,” ضْ حيُ أَضْ حى  /  ي
“to become” pertains to ًحىُ“ ضmid-morning, before noon” and ُ باتَ / يَبيت
“to remain” pertains to sleeping overnight, overnighting.
Furthermore, some of these verbs share the same meaning although they 
are derived from different roots. For example, ُ صارَ / يَصريand ُصبِحُ ,أَصْ بَحَ / ي
in addition to ـمْيسُ ,أَمْسى / يall mean “to become.”
The frequency with which these verbs are used varies. For example,  
َصبِحُ أَصْ بَحَ / يand َ صارَ / يَصريare more frequently used than ـمْيسُ أَمْسى / يand 
ضْ حيُ أَضْ حى / يdespite their shared meaning. On the other hand, ُ ما زالَ / ال يَزال
and ُ , باتَ / يَبيتin addition to ُّ ,ظَ لَّ / يَظَ لall mean “to remain.”  ما زالَ / ال
ُ يَزالand ُّ ظَ لَّ / يَظَ لand َ ما دامare more commonly used than ُ .باتَ / يَبيتWe 
should also mention that one hears or sees in writing the forms َ ال  زالand 
ُ ,ما يَزالwhich are considered by purists to be wrong usages. They consider َ ما زال
and its present form ُ ال يَزالto be the only correct forms since  ماis restricted 
to past tense verbs, and  الto the present tense.
There are other verbs that belong to this list of kaana and its sisters, including 
َ .ما انـْفَكَّ ، ما بَـرِحَ ، ما فَـتـِئThese verbs are characterized by the past tense nega
tive particle  ماin front of them; however, these verbs are not commonly used 
in Modern Standard Arabic. They all convey the meaning of ُ ما زالَ / ال يَزال
introduced in the list above. Some of these verbs have functions outside of 
equational sentences.
It was stated at the outset of this chapter that all these elements are used 
with equational sentences and exhibit an identical behavior, despite differences 
in their functions. General statements about their behavior in equational  
sentences can be made:
1.
The gender of the subject must be marked in the verb.
2.
If subjects optionally precede any kaana and any of its sisters, these verbs

ملةِاالِسْ مِيَّةُنَفْي اجل
 لَيْسَis treated as a verb in Arabic, subject to conjugation only in the past tense. 
It conjugates with singular, dual and plural pronouns.
10.1.1 Negation of the equational sentence in  
the singular
The singular pronouns are listed in the table below, along with the ending  
associated with each pronoun:

َوُه

لَيْسَhe/it is not
َهِي
 تْ
لَيْسَ تْshe/it is not
Note that the yaa’ of َ لَيْسis dropped for the first person singular pronoun  أَنا
and for the second person pronoun َ أَنْتand ِ .أَنتAs the table illustrates, if the 
subject of the equational sentence is a pronoun, َ لَيْسchanges its ending to 
express that pronoun in its suffix. This is accomplished by having a suffixal 
form attached to the end of َ لَيْسas in any verb. In addition to the singular, 
َ لَيْسconjugates in the dual and plural as we shall see below.
Equational sentences are negated by َ لَيْسin the present tense. Compare the 
following examples in the affirmative, followed by the negative:
. ِّ يف الصَّ فُستاذُاألThe teacher (M) is in the classroom.
. ِّ يف الصَّ فُستاذُلَيْسَ األThe teacher (M) is not in the classroom.
. ِّ يف الصَّ فُستاذَةُاألThe teacher (F) is in the classroom.
. ِّ يف الصَّ فُستاذَةُلَيْسَ تِ األThe teacher (F) is not in the classroom.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
100
The use of َ لَيْسas a negative particle is restricted to written and formal spoken 
Arabic only.
The position of َ لَيْسin the sentence has some flexibility. It can either  
precede the subject or follow it immediately, as in the following.
.ِ يف الـمَكْ تَبَةُالطّ الِبThe student is in the library.
.ِ لَيْسَ يف الـمَكْ تَبَةُالطّ الِبThe student is not in the library.
.ِ يف الـمَكْ تَبَةُلَيْسَ الطّ الِبThe student is not in the library.
The repetition of the pronoun with the conjugated َ لَيْسis redundant; however, 
its repetition adds emphasis, as in the following:
.وتْيرَهِيَ مِن بShe is from Beirut.
.هِيَ لَيْسَ ت مِن بَريوتShe is not from Beirut.
.وتْيرَلَيْسَ ت مِن بShe is not from Beirut.
If, in discourses, a noun has been previously mentioned, the repetition of the 
noun or pronoun becomes redundant.
Mention should be made that َ لَيْسcan be preceded by the interrogative َ أ
to corroborate or to seek information, as in the following:
سْ تاذاً؟ُأَلَيْسَ حممّد أIsn’t Mohammed a teacher?
Additionally, َ أَلَيْسcould be used in a question tag format following an  
equational sentence, also to corroborate the statement in the sentence. Consider 
the following:
يلٌ اليَوْمَ. أَلَيْسَ كَذلِك؟َم جُالطَّ قْسThe weather is good today. Isn’t it?
10.1.2 Negation of the equational sentence in the dual 
ثَنّىُ الـم- مْلَة االِسْ مِيَّةُنَفْي اجل

As in the singular, subjects of equational sentence negated by َ لَيْسremain 
unchanged. َ لَيْسmust indicate the subject’s gender. If the dual subject precedes 
َ لَيْسits number must also be marked in the verb. Consider the following  
examples:
. ِوَظَّ فانِ يف املَكْ تَبُلَيْسَ املThe employees (M, D) are not in the office.
. ِوَظَّ فانِ لَيْسا يف املَكْ تَبُاملThe employees (M) are not in the office.

10.2.1 Singular nouns and adjectives as predicates
Nouns or adjectives functioning as predicates of equational sentences negated 
by َ لَيْسmust change into the accusative case. In formal spoken Arabic, this is 
marked by the sound -an. In the orthography, the predicate must end with an 
’alif with two fat-Has ً اif the negated predicate noun or adjective is masculine, 
as in the following examples:
.َِد طالِبٌ يف اجلامِعَةْمأَحAhmad is a student at the university.
.َِد طالِباً يف اجلامِعَةْملَيْسَ أحAhmad is not a student at the university.
.ِ جَ ديدٌ يف الـمَدْرَسَ ةُالطّ الِبThe student is new at school.
.ِ جَ ديداً يف الـمَدْرَسَ ةُلَيْسَ الطّ الِبThe student is not new at school.
If the predicate noun or adjective is feminine, the two fat-Has are placed above the 
taa’ marbuuTa ً ةof the feminine noun or adjective, as in the following examples:
.ٌمَرْيَـمْ طالِبَةMaryam is a student.
.ًلَيْسَ ت مَرْيَـمْ طالِبَةMaryam is not a student.
.ٌ جَ ديدَةُالسّ يّارَةThe car is new.
.ً جَ ديدَةُلَيْسَ تِ السَّ يارَةThe car is not new.
If the predicate is an IDhaafa-construct, only the first noun of the IDhaafa is 
in the accusative case, as in the following example:
. ِ املَكْ تَبُديرَةُسوزان هِيَ مSuzanne is the office director.
. ِديرَةَ املَكْ تَبُلَيْسَ ت سوزان مSuzanne is not the office director.

Kaana and its sisters
103
10.2.2 Dual nouns and adjectives as predicates
Predicate adjectives or nouns must change into the accusative. The accusative 
case of the dual noun or adjective is ِ يْـنfor the masculine and ِ تَيـْنfor the 
feminine. َ لَيْسmust indicate the gender of the feminine subject. The following 
pairs, in which the first sentence is in the affirmative, the second in the negative, 
illustrate the point:
.ِمود وعَيل طالِبانَمحMahmoud and Ali are students (M, D).
.ِلَيْسَ حممود وَعَيل طالِبَـيـْنMahmoud and Ali are not students (M, D).
.ِديرَتانِ جَ ديدَتانُالـمThe directors (F, D) are new.
.ِديرَتانِ جَ ديدَتَـيـْنُلَيْسَ تِ الـمThe directors (F, D) are not new.
If َ لَيْسfollows the subject, it must express the number of the subject as well 
as its gender, as in the following:
.ِديرَتانِ جَ ديدَتانُالـمThe directors (F, D) are new.
.ِديرَتانِ لَيْسَ تا جَ ديدَتَيـْنُالـمThe directors (F, D) are not new.
.ِمود وَعَيل طالِبانَمحMahmoud and Ali are students (M, D).
.ِحممود وَعَيل لَيْسا طالِبَيـْنMahmoud and Ali are not students (M, D).
10.2.3 Plural nouns and adjectives as predicates
Adjectives or nouns as predicates of equational sentences must change into the 
accusative. The accusative case of a regular plural noun or adjective is َين- for 
the masculine and ٍات- for the feminine. Consider the following:
. َوَظَّ فونُسَ ليم وعيل وجورج م
Salim, Ali and George are employees.
.َوَظَّ فنيُلَيْسَ سَ ليم وعيل وجورج م
Salim, Ali and George are not employees.
. ٌسوزان ولَيْىل وسَ لمى طالِبات
Susanne, Laila and Salma are students.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
104
. ٍلَيْسَ ت سوزان ولَيْىل وسَ لمى طالِبات
Susanne, Laila and Salma are not students.
. َديرونَ مَعْروفونُالـم
The directors (M, Pl) are well known.
.َديرونَ مَعْروفنيُلَيْسَ الـم
The directors (M, Pl) are not well known.
. ٌ نَشيطاتُالطَّ الِبات
The students (F, Pl) are active.
. ٍ نَشيطاتُلَيْسَ تِ الطّ الِبات
The students (F, Pl) are not active.
Consider the following examples that illustrate the verb’s gender and number 
when subjects precede َ لَيْسor any of the members of َ:كان
ديرونَ مَعْروفونَ .ُالـم
The directors (M, Pl) are well known.
.َديرونَ لَـيْسوا مَعْروفنيُالـم
The directors (M, Pl) are not well known.
. ٌ عِراقِيّاتُسْ تاذاتُاأل

Equational sentences express propositions in the present time without the use 
of a verb (see Chapter 9 on the equational sentence). The use of the verb َ كان
is required to put equational sentences into the past tense. As with َ لَيْسin the 
preceding section, َ كانhas some flexibility with respect to its placement in the 
equational sentence. Regardless of its position,  كانhas no impact on the case 
of the sentence subject. Prepositional or adverbial phrase predicates remain 
unchanged. Noun or adjective predicates must change into the accusative.

10.3.1 The equational sentence in past tense in  
the singular فْرَدُ الـم- مْلَة االِسْ مِيَّة يف الـاميضُاجل
 كانَis conjugated like any other Form I hollow verb, as illustrated in the table 
below. The singular pronouns are listed below, along with the ending associated 
with each pronoun:

ِأَنْت
ِت
نـْتُِكyou (F) were
َوُه
—
كانَhe was
َهِي
ْت
كانَتْshe was
This internal morphological change by the use of Dhamma can be explained 
by considering the present tense form of َ كانfor َوُ ,هwhich is ُ( .يَكونSee the 
detailed discussion of hollow verbs in Form I in Chapter 11).
10.3.1.1 Nouns or adjectives as predicates
. ٌَد طالِبْمأَحAhmad is a student.
.ًَد طالِباْمكانَ أَحAhmad was a student.
. ٌ جَ ديدُالطّ الِبThe student is new.
.ً جَ ديداُكانَ الطّ الِبThe student was new.
If the predicate is a feminine noun or adjective, two fat-Has are placed above 
the taa’ marbuuTa ً ةof the feminine noun or adjective. Compare the following 
sentences in the present and in the past:
.ٌمَرْيَم طالِبَةMaryam is a student.
.ًكانَت مَرْيَم طالِبَةMaryam was a student.
.ٌ جَ ديدَةُالسَّ يّارَةThe car is new.

Or, in a nominal sentence:
.ِنَّ يف الـمَطْ عَمُ كُسْ تاذاتُاأل
The professors (F, Pl) were in the restaurant.
.ِنَّ يف الـمَطْ عَمُ ما كُسْ تاذاتُاأل
The professors (F, Pl) were not in the restaurant.
10.4.2  ل+ Jussive of َكان
 كانَcan be negated by the negative particle  ,لwhich requires a present tense 
form in the jussive to follow it. As shown in Chapter 15, the use of  لwith 
hollow verbs results in the shortening of the long vowel of the present tense 
form into its counterpart. In other words, if the present tense form of the hollow 
verb has waaw, the short counterpart vowel is Dhamma; if it is yaa’, the short 
counterpart vowel is kasra; and, finally, if it is ’alif the counterpart vowel is 
fat-Ha. In the case of َ كانthe verb form following  لmust have a Dhamma due 
to the fact that the present tense of this verb has a waaw, namely ُ .يَكونThe 
following table illustrates َ كانafter  لin the singular, dual and plural:

ُ“ سَ وْفَ يَكونhe will be,” ُصْ بِحُ“ سَ يhe will become”. (The future tense and its 
negation is presented in Chapter 14.)

The second type of sentence structure in Arabic, the verbal sentence, is  
introduced in this chapter. Following that, verbs in the past tense in the  
singular are presented, followed by verbs in the dual and the plural, respectively. 
Other tenses will be discussed in subsequent chapters. We now turn to examine 
how verbal sentences are constructed with these two types of verbs.
11.1 Sentence 
tructure بِناء اجلُملَة
Verbal sentences are formed by placing the verb at the beginning of the  
sentence, followed by the  فاعِلnoun in the nominative. Recall that the verb at 
the beginning of a sentence is always singular, regardless of the number of the 
subject. Verbs must indicate gender, however. Examine the following verbal 
sentences in which the subject is a plural noun:
.سافَرَ الطُّ الّبُ إىل حَ لَبThe students traveled to Aleppo.
.سافَرَتِ الطّ الِباتُ إِىل حَ لَبThe students (F) traveled to Aleppo.
As has been mentioned elsewhere, the subject can occur before the verb, thus 
adding emphasis to the subject. The verb must indicate number and gender, as 
in the following examples of nominal sentences:
.الطُّ الّبُ سافَروا إِىل تونِسThe students (M) traveled to Tunisia.
.الطاّلِباتُ سافَرْنَ إِىل تونِسThe students (F) traveled to Tunisia.
Arab grammarians emphasize and encourage the placement of verbs at the 
beginning of sentences.

11.2 Sentence  wit  intr n iti e 
erb   
ُاألَفْعالُ الالزِمَة
As a general rule, sentences are constructed in the following sequential format: 
A verb occurs at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the  ,فاعِلi.e. agentive 
noun, the doer, and, optionally, there may be additional information that is 
provided by the speaker to the addressee, or reader. This additional information 
could be expressed by the use of prepositional or adverbial phrases expressing 
place, time, or manner. Schematically, a verbal sentence in Arabic looks like 
the following in its sequential order from right to left:
(Additional information) + (Agentive noun) + Verb
Note that the use of parentheses in the string in the schema above indicates 
that this information is optional. The following sentences are generated according 
to this schema:
.نامَ عَيلAli slept.
. ُاِبْـتَسَ مَ الطّ الِبThe student smiled.
If one chooses to add extra information as to where, when, or how Ali slept 
in the first sentence above, this is usually done by the use of prepositional or 
adverbial phrases, as in the examples below:
. ِنامَ عَيل يف البَيْتAli slept in the house.
.ًنامَ عَيل صَ باحاAli slept in the morning.
.ًاِبْـتَسَ مَ عَيل كَثرياAli smiled a lot.
Thus the phrases ِ“ يف البَيْتin the house,” ً“ صَ باحاin the morning,” and ً“ كَثرياa 
lot” provide additional, optional information. Lists of adverbs of time, as well 
as adverbs of place, in addition to adverbs of degree are provided in Chapter 7.
11.3 Sentence  wit  tr n iti e

Sentences with transitive verbs are structured in the following linear sequence: 
a verb occurs at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the  فاعِلperformer 

Verbal sentences: past tense

of action, the doer, followed by the direct object (ِ ,)مَفعول بِهfollowed by any 
other additional information that the speaker or writer wishes to provide to 
his/her listener or reader. ِ مَفعول  بِهis a person or a thing that undergoes or 
receives the action expressed in the verb. The direct object is always in the  
accusative case ( ,)مَنْصوبand it can be definite or indefinite. If the direct object 
noun is singular and definite, it must end with a fat-Ha in formal spoken or 
scripted Arabic. On the other hand, if the direct object is indefinite, it must 
end with an ’alif bearing two fat-Has ً( اtanwiin) in the orthography if the noun 
is masculine. Some masculine nouns ending with hamza do not take this  
’alif-bearing two fat-Has when such nouns are indefinite and accusative, as in, 
for example, ً“ سَ امءsky,” ً“ ماءwater,” ً“ هواءair,” etc. If the direct object is a 
feminine noun, it ends with two fat-Has placed above the feminine marker, the 
taa’ marbuuTa ً.ة
Any additional information can be expressed through the use of prepositional 
or adverbial phrases that express place, time, manner, or degree. Schematically, 
this looks like the following right-to-left order:
(additional information) + direct object + (agentive noun) + verb
The parentheses in the string indicate that such items are optional. Examine 
the following sentences in which the direct object nouns are definite:
.َأَكَلَ عَيل اخلُبْزAli ate the bread.
. َدَرَّسَ األُسْ تاذُ الطّ الِبThe teacher taught the student.
The direct objects in the following sentences are indefinite nouns. Hence the 
use of ً اwith the masculine noun in the first example, and ً ةwith the feminine 
noun in the second:
.ًدَرَّسَ األُسْ تاذُ طالِباThe teacher taught a student (M).
.ًدَرَّسَ األُسْ تاذُ طالِبَةThe teacher taught a student (F).
If one chooses to add extra information as to where, when, or how Ali ate the 
bread in the first sentence above, or where, how, or when the teacher taught 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

the student in the second sentence above, this information can be provided 
most readily through the use of prepositional or adverbial phrases, as in the 
examples below:
. ِأَكَلَ عيل اخلُبْزَ يف البَيْتAli ate the bread in the house.
. ِدَرَّسَ األُستاذُ الطّ الِبَ أَمْسThe teacher taught the student yesterday.
Thus in the sentences above, ِ“ يف  البَيْتin the house” and ِ“ أَمْسyesterday” 
provide added optional information.
Arabic provides some flexibility in the order of elements in verbal sentences. 
This pertains to two elements: (1) the “ فاعِلagentive noun,” and (2) the pre
positional or adverbial phrase.
The  فاعِلcan precede the verb optionally. This changes the status of the 
sentence from a verbal to a nominal sentence. Placing a word at the beginning 
of a sentence adds emphasis to that word. The sentence below, for instance, 
emphasizes that the bread eater was the student, not anyone else:
.َالطّ الِبُ أَكَلَ اخلُبْزThe student ate the bread.
If the  فاعِلis a feminine noun, gender agreement must be marked in the verb 
by suffixing ت- to the verb. Examine the following examples:
.َالطّ الِبَةُ أَكَلَتِ اخلُبْزThe student (F) ate the bread.
.َأَكَلَتِ الطّ الِبَةُ اخلُبْزThe student (F) ate the bread.
The verb ِ“ أَكَلَتshe ate” in the preceding two examples ends with an epenthetic 
kasra. The insertion of this vowel is to break the consonant cluster for easier 
pronunciation.
There is another condition pertaining to number that must apply. Singular 
nouns do not present any further requirements. If, however, the  فاعِلis a dual 
or plural noun placed before the verb, the verb must reflect the number of the 
agentive noun. This matter will be taken up when we discuss duals and plurals, 
and verb conjugation with dual and plural nouns in this chapter.
Prepositional or adverbial phrases have more flexibility in word order in 
verbal sentences. They can occur at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. 

Verbal sentences: past tense
115
The location of these phrases is linked to the degree of emphasis desired. 
Compare the following two examples:
.َيف البَيْتِ أَكَلَ عَيل اخلُبْزAt home, Ali ate the bread.
. ِأَكَلَ عَيل اخلُبْزَ يف البَيْتAli ate the bread at home.
In the first sentence, the prepositional phrase ِ يف البَيْتhighlights the location 
of the action. In the second, emphasis is on َ“ أَكَلhe ate,” as opposed to another 
action Ali might have performed.

Arabic verbs in the past tense for the third person singular pronoun َ هُ وalways 
end with a fat-Ha. The middle vowel may be a fat-Ha as in َ“ كَتَبhe wrote,” 
or a kasra as in َ“ لَعِبhe played,” or a Dhamma as in َ ُر“ كَبhe grew up.” It is 
difficult to make generalizations about the middle vowel of َ فَعَلverbs. Schooled 
native speakers memorize their verb patterns and internalize this information. 
Foreign learners are expected to do the same.
Below is a list of tri-consonantal َ فَعَلverbs that are commonly used. The 
list is divided into intransitive and transitive verbs. As a general tendency,  
intransitive verbs are often used with prepositions which are learned as part 
and parcel of learning the verb itself and how it is used.
Intransitive verbs:
Middle fat-Ha:
َذَهَبto go
َجَ لَسto sit
َرَجَ عto return
ََضَهنto rise, get up
َخَ رَجto go out, exit
Middle Dhamma:
َ ُركَبto become bigger
َُلَمجto become pretty
َصَ غُرto become smaller
َقَبُحto become ugly
َحَ سُ نto become better
Middle kasra:
َضَ حِ كto laugh
َفَرِحto become happy
َخَ جِ لto become shy
َطَ رِبto be moved by music, song
َيَئِسto despair, to lose hope
َسَ عِدto become happy
َيَبِسto become dry

11.4.1.3 Hollow verbs األَفْعال اجلَوْفاء
Hollow verbs in the past tense consist of two consonants separated by an ’alif
 اas in َ“ نامto sleep,” َ“ قالto say,” etc.
All hollow verbs maintain the past tense suffixes in their conjugation in the 
past tense. The only noticeable difference is the change in the vowel following 
the first consonant. This vowel can be a Dhamma or a kasra.
The Dhamma is a reflex of the long vowel waaw in its present tense form 
of the verb. For example, the present tense of the verb َ“ زارto visit” is ُ .يَزورIn 
conjugating this verb in the past tense, a Dhamma, a short version of the waaw, 
is used. Examine the following table:
Independent pronoun
Past tense form
Meaning
أَنا
زُرْتُI visited
َأَنْت
زُرْتَyou (M) visited
ِأَنْت
زُرْتِyou (F) visited

If the middle vowel in the present tense form of the verb is an ’alif  اor a yaa’ 
 يthe vowel following the first consonant in the past tense must be a kasra for 
the pronouns “ أَناI,” َ“ أَنْتyou (M),” and ِ“ أَنتyou (F).” For example, the 
present tense form of the verb َ“ نامto sleep” is ُ يَنامand ُ سارَ/ يَسريis “to walk.” 
Examine the conjugation of the verb َ“ نامto sleep,” in the past tense, followed 
by the conjugation of َ“ سارto walk”:

Verbs that end with ’alif  maqSuura exhibit a shortening of this vowel sound, 
and a compensatory semi-consonant yaa’ is added following this short fat-Ha. 
In the orthography, this yaa’ is written on a seat. This is true for the conjugation 
of such verbs for the pronouns “ أَناI,” َ“ أَنْتyou (M),” and ِ“ أَنْتyou (F).” The

hard work.” However, in the present tense they end with ’alif  maqSuura for the 
pronoun َ هُ وas in  يَرىand  يَسْ عىrespectively. Examine the conjugation of the

It is of interest to note that the verb “ ﺣﹶﻴﹼﺎ / ﳛﹸﹶﻴﹼﻲto greet” that belongs to this group 
is written with regular long ’alif: an example of imperfect orthography. Perhaps 
this is done to avoid the writing of two adjacent yaa’s (one with the two integral 
dots, followed by the ’alif  maqSuura that resembles yaa’ but without the dots.)

11.4.2.2 Form III verbs َصيغَة فاعَل
Form III is made by inserting ’alif  after the first consonant of the verb; it conveys 
the notion that effort is made to carry out the action of the verb upon the 
recipient, the direct object (in the case of transitive verbs). It also conveys the 
idea of reciprocity.
Below is the conjugation of ُ“ كاتَبَ  /  يُكاتِبto correspond with” as an

A group of َ فاعَلform (Form III) verbs ends with ’alif  maqSuura, as in the  
following list. In conjugating these verbs in the past tense, the ’alif  maqSuura 
changes to a yaa’ before the suffix is added, similar to the defective verbs ending 
with ’alif  maqSuura presented in an earlier section. Examine the conjugation 
of the verb “ نادى / يُناديto call”:

َهُ و
نادىhe called
َهِي
نادَتْshe called
The present tense of such a group has a yaa’ at this end, as in “ نادى / يُناديto 
call someone’s attention.” Here is a sample list:
بارى / يُباريto compete with (in sports)
ايبُححابى / يto favor, to side with s.o.

11.4.2.3 Form IV verbs َصيغَة أَفْعَل
These are formed by the prefixation of ’alif, causing the first consonant to lose 
its vowel. Verbs in this category can be transitive or intransitive. Some of these 
verbs are declarative, stating a fact, often derived from nouns. For example, 
َ“ أَمْطَ رto rain” is derived from the noun ٌ“ مَطَ رrain,” and َ“ أَثْلَجto snow” is  
derived from ٌ“ ثَلْجsnow.”
In the table below, we provide the conjugation of the verb َ“ أَكْمَلto complete,”

11.4.2.4 Form V verbs َصيغَة تَفَعَّل
This form is obtained by the prefixation of َ تـto Form II verbs and conveys a 
reflexive notion and also a degree of intensity as in Form II. َ تَفَعَّلverbs share 
features of the same meaning with verbs in  فَعَّلforms. However, the difference 
between these two categories is in the way they are used in sentence construction, 
i.e. syntax. Whereas َ فَعَّلforms often tend to have a direct object, َ تَفَعَّلverbs 
often require the use of a preposition. Examine the following pair of sentences:

A limited number of hollow verbs can be derived according to this pattern, as 
in the following:
ُيحَراحَ / يَسْ تَراِسْ تto rest
ُاِسْ تَطاعَ / يَسْ تَطيعto be able to
ُاِسْ تَعادَ / يَسْ تَعيدto retrieve

ُاِسْ تَقامَ / يَسْ تَقيمto become straight
ُاِسْ تَنامَ / يَسْ تَنيمto let oneself be lulled to sleep, to accede
Moreover, a few doubled verbs can be derived according to this pattern:
ُّاِسْ تَجَ دَّ / يَسْ تَجِ دto come newly into existence
ُّاِسْ تَحَ لَّ / يَسْ تَحِ لto seize unlawfully, to regard s.th. as permissible

ُّاِسْ تَمَدَّ / يَسْ تَمِدto derive
ُّاِسْ تَمَرَّ / يَسْ تَمِرto continue, to pursue
Additionally, a few defective verbs can be derived according to this pattern:
اِسْ تَبْقى / يَسْ تَبْقيto ask s.o. to stay
اِسْ تَثْنى / يَسْ تَثْنيto exclude, to except
اِسْ تَدْعى / يَسْ تَدعيto call, to beckon

11.4.3 Quadriliteral verbs
Another group, َ ,فَعْلَلis derived from nouns originally assimilated into Arabic 
from foreign languages. These include, among others, َ“ فَلْسَ فto philosophize,” 
derived from “ فَلْسَ فَةphilosophy,” َ“ جَ لْبَبto dress s.o. with a garment,” from 
“ جِ لْبابa garment, a dress,” and َ“ تَلْمَذto make someone a pupil,” from  تِلْميذ
“a student.”
The quadriliteral verb pattern َ فَعْلَلis used in Modern Standard Arabic  
to derive verbs from borrowed European nouns, such as names of modern 
apparatuses imported from the West. Thus, the verb َ“ تَلْفَنto telephone” was 
derived from the commonly used European noun “ تَلِفونtelephone.” Similarly 
َ“ تَلْفَزto televise” was derived from the borrowed European noun  تِلْفزيون
“television.” Quadriliteral verbs can also be derived from some country names. 
For example, from “ امريكاUSA,” we obtain the verb َ“ أَمْرَكto americanize;” 
from “ لُبْنانLebanon,” we obtain َ“ لَبْنَنto lebanize;” from ّ“ األُرْدُنJordan,” we 
obtain َ“ أَرْدَنto jordanize.”
It is worth noting that some of these verbs are transitive, requiring direct 
objects, such as َ“ هَنْدَسto engineer” and َ“ دَحْ رَجto roll something out”; some 
others are intransitive and require the use of prepositions such as “ سَ يْطَ رَ عَىلto 
have control over someone or something,” “ وَشْ وَشَ إىلto whisper to someone.” 
Examine the following examples:
.ِدَحْ رَجَ الالعِبُ كُرَةَ القَدَمThe player rolled the football.
. ِِكَةُ عَىل األسواقَّرسَ يْطَ رَتِ الشThe company had control over all markets.
It should be mentioned that from the verb form َ فَعْلَلother verbs can be derived 
according to the pattern َ تَفَعْلَلto signify a reflexive meaning. Thus from the trans
itive verb َ“ دَحْ رَجto roll s.th.” we obtain َ“ تَدَحْ رَجto roll oneself;” from َ“ أَمْرَكto 
Americanize,” we obtain َ“ تَأَمْرَكto become American;” and from َ“ بَلْبَلto confuse 
someone,” we obtain َ“ تَبَلْبَلto become confused, confounded.”

pronouns have a second function in Arabic. They can be suffixed to transitive 
verbs to function as direct objects. The suffix form of a pronoun cannot  
stand alone; it must be attached to the verb. There is a minor difference,  
however, in the suffixal form of  .أَناWhen  يis suffixed to verbs it changes to 
 ينby inserting a nuun to avoid having two vowels in sequence. Let us now 
examine the suffix pronouns as direct objects of the transitive verb َ شاهَدin the 
past tense:

11.6.1 Hollow verbs األفْعال اجلَوْفاء
Hollow verbs show a change in their middle vowels when suffixes beginning 
with consonants as in  ناand اُم تare attached to past tense verbs. Past tense verbs 
for اُم( هM) end with a regular ’alif  .اPast tense verbs for اُم( هF) end with .تا
The middle vowel in the past tense is always either a Dhamma, as in ُ زارَ / يَزور
“to visit,” or a kasra, as in ُ“ سارَ / يَسريto walk.” The choice of Dhamma or 
kasra is related to the vowel in the present tense form of the verb. If the  
vowel in the present tense is a waaw, the vowel in the past tense is a Dhamma. 
For example, the present tense of the verb َ“ زارto visit” is ُ .يَزورTherefore, a 
Dhamma is used in the conjugation of this verb in the past, as in the follow
ing table:
Independent pronoun

اُمه
زاراthey (M) visited
اُمه
زارَتــاthey (F) visited
On the other hand, if the vowel in the present tense of the verb is an ’alif or 
a yaa’, the short vowel in the past tense is a kasra. The verb َ“ سارto walk” has 
a yaa’ in its present tense, and the verb َ“ نامto sleep” has an ’alif in its present 
tense. A kasra is used in the conjugation of these two verbs in the past tense.

11.7 Sentence 
tructure بِناء اجلُمْلَة
The verb at the beginning of a sentence is always singular, regardless of  
the number of the subject. The only condition placed on initial verbs is  
gender agreement between the verb and the subject, as in the following  
examples:
.َدَرَسَ الطّ الِبانِ العَرَبِيَّة
The students (M, D) studied Arabic.
.َدَرَسَ تِ الطّ الِبَتانِ العَرَبِيَّة
The students (F, D) studied Arabic.
If the dual subject precedes the verb, the verb must express the number and 
gender of the subject noun. Examine the following examples:
.الطّ الِبانِ سافَرا إِىل تونِس
The two students (M) traveled to Tunisia.
.الطّ الِبَتانِ سافَرَتا إىل تونِس
The two students (F) traveled to Tunisia.

Verbal sentences: past tense
151
When the dual pronouns  أَنْتُامand اُم هprecede the verb in the past tense, the 
verb must be marked for the dual by the presence of an ’alif at the end of the 
verb, as in the following sentences:
.ِأَنْتُام دَرَسْ تُام يف اجلامِعَةYou studied at the university.
.ِا دَرَسا يف اجلامِعَةُمهThey studied at the university.
.ِا دَرَسَ تا يف اجلامِعَةُمهThey studied at the university.

Verbs conjugate in the plural in the past tense by attaching the personal plural

the suffixes that attach to verbs in the past tense;

For ْ“ هُ مthey (M),” the verb suffix in the past tense is represented in the 
writing system by waaw followed by a dummy ’alif that has no phonetic

the reader to indicate that this element is a verb. Examine the conjugation

11.9.1 Hollow verbs األفْعال اجلَوْفاء
Hollow verbs show a change in their middle vowels when suffixes beginning 
with consonants as in  ناand ْ ,تُمin addition to َّ تُنand َ ,نare attached to past 
tense verbs.
When conjugating these verbs in the past tense, the middle vowel is always 
either a Dhamma, as in ُ“ زارَ / يَزورto visit,” or a kasra, as in ُ“ سارَ / يَسريto 
walk.”
The choice between the Dhamma or kasra is determined by the vowel in 
the present tense form of the verb. If the vowel is a waaw in the present tense, 
the vowel in the past tense is a Dhamma, as in َ“ زارto visit,” whose present 
tense for the pronoun َ“ هُ وhe” is ُ.يَزور
On the other hand, if the vowel in the present tense of the verb is an ’alif 
or a yaa’, the short vowel in the past tense is a kasra. The verb َ“ نامto sleep” 
has an ’alif in its present tense for the pronoun َ ,هُ وas in ُ ,يَنامand the verb َ سار
“to walk” has a yaa’ in its present tense, as in ُ .يَسريA kasra, therefore, is used

11.11 P
t ten e neg tion
Verbs in the past tense are negated by the negative particle  ماplaced immediately 
in front of the verb. The verb form remains unchanged, as in the following 
examples:
.ُما دَرَسَ الطّ الِبُ دَرْسَ ه
The student did not read his lesson.
.وتْما سافَرَ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ إل بير
The teacher did not travel to Beirut.
. َما كَتَبَتِ الطّ الِبَتانِ الواجِ ب
The two students (F) did not write the homework.
.َِبَتِ البَناتُ القَهْوَةَرما ش
The girls did not drink the coffee.
If the  فاعِلprecedes the verb,  ماis placed immediately before the verb, as in 
the following examples:
.الطّ الِبَةُ ما رَجَ عَت مِنْ بَيْتِها
The student (F) did not return from her house.
.ََ ةَرا الـمُ حاضَرالـمُ عَلِّامنِ ما حَ ض
The teachers (M, D) did not attend the lecture.
.ِالـمُ وَظَّ فونَ ما شاركوا يف االِحتِفال
The employees did not participate in the celebration.
.َالطَّ بيباتُ ما اِسْ تَقْبَلْنَ الـمَرْىض اليَوْم
The doctors (F, Pl) did not receive patients today.
There is a second negative particle used to negate past tense verbs, namely ْ َم .ل
The use of ْ َم لrequires change in the verb that follows it. This negative particle 
will be presented in detail in Chapter 15.

The present tense indicative is used to express actions occurring in the present 
time as statements of fact or opinion. The actions can be a singular occurrence, 
as in:
. َيَعْمَلُ اِبْني واجِ بَهُ اآلنMy son is doing his homework now.
Or they can be habitual, as in:
.ِيَرْكُضُ عَزيز كُلَّ صَ باحٍ قَبْلَ املَدْرَسَ ةAziz runs every morning before  
school.
The present tense indicative can also express actions that will happen in the 
future, particularly the very near future, as in:
.ًتَرْجِ عُ املُديرَةُ غَداThe director (F) returns tomorrow.
Other moods of the present tense are covered in Chapter 13 (subjunctive); 
Chapter 15 (jussive); and Chapter 17 (imperative).
12.1 present tense singular الفِعل الـمُ ضارِع الـمُ فْرَد
The present tense of verbs in the singular is indicated by the use of prefixes in 
the form of consonants followed by vowels. The vowel following the prefix, 
written above it in the orthography, is either a fat-Ha or a Dhamma, depending 
on the verb form, called  وَزْنor  صيغةin Arabic. The present tense verb form 
for the feminine singular pronoun ِ أَنْتrequires a prefix and a suffix. The pre-
fixes (and suffix for the ِأَنْت ) for the singular pronouns are represented in the 
table below:

12.1.1 Form I verbs َصيغة فَعَل
The prefixes in the conjugation of this verb pattern are followed by a fat-Ha, 
which is used throughout the َ فَعَلverbs (Form I). Thus, the conjugation of the 
verb َ“ دَرَسto study” in the present tense looks like the following:

In َ فَعَلverbs (Form I) the middle vowel is largely unpredictable. It can be a 
fat-Ha, a Dhamma, or a kasra. It is difficult to make a definitive rule about which 
verbs in َ فَعَلform (Form I) take which vowel in their middle, except for one 
group of verbs. Verbs that have a kasra in their middle in the past tense always 
have a fat-Ha in the present tense, as in the following illustrative examples:
ُسَ مِعَ / يَسْ مَعto hear
َُبْرِبَ / يَشَرشto drink
ُعَمِلَ / يَعْمَلto make, to do

ُفَهِمَ / يَفْهَمto understand
ُلَعِبَ / يَلْعَبto play
The following may help manage this phenomenon. Schoolchildren in the  
Arab world are introduced to the past tense of a particular verb for the third 
person singular pronoun َ هُ وwhen they begin learning verbs in Arabic, and they 
simultaneously learn the present tense for that verb. For example, they learn the 
past tense verb َ“ هُ وَ كَتَبto write; lit. he wrote,” and its present form: ُ .هُ وَ يَكْ تُب
The middle vowel in the present for the verb َ كَتَبis therefore a Dhamma. It 
must be strongly emphasized that the Dhamma is specific in this case to the verb 
َ كَتَبand some others. Other verbs may have different vowels in their middle. 
For example, the middle vowel of the verb َ“ ذَهَبto go” in the present tense is a 
fat-Ha, i.e. ُ .يَذْهَبTherefore, foreign learners, following the tradition practiced 
by schooled native speakers, are expected to memorize the middle vowel of 
the past and the present tense of verb forms to be able to use them correctly.
Below is a list of Form I verbs َ صيغَة  فَعَلwith their meanings, grouped 
together according to the middle vowel in the present tense:
Dhamma
ُأَخَ ذَ / يَأْخُ ذto take
ُ أَكَلَ / يَأْكُلto eat
ُُكْرتَرَكَ / يَتto leave s.th., to depart
ْصُ لُ عَىلَححَ صَ لَ عَىل / يto obtain
ُ ُرْضَحَ / يَرحَ ضto attend
ُدَرَسَ / يَدْرُسto study
ُكَتَبَ / يَكْ تُبto write
ُشَ كَ رَ / يَشْ كُ رto thank
ُدَخَ لَ / يَدْخُ لto enter
In conjugating the verb ُ“ أَكَلَ / يَأْكُلto eat” the hamza is maintained on its ’alif  
for all prefixes except for the pronoun  .أَناThe combination of the two hamzas 
in ُ أَأْكُلand ُ أَأْخُ ذis replaced by madda, as in ُ“ أَنا آكُلI eat” and ُ“ أَنا آخُ ذI take.”

Present tense indicative

Fat-Ha
ُذَهَبَ / يَذْهَبto go
ُفَعَلَ / يَفْعَلto do
َُقَرَأَ / يَقْرَأto read
َُضَ / يَنْهَضَهنto rise, to wake up
ُسَ أَلَ / يَسْ أَلto ask, to inquire
In writing, the hamza of َُ“ قَرَأَ / يَقْرَأto read” is written above the ’alif as in َُ أَنا أَقْرَأ
“I read” and so on. For the pronoun ِ“ أَنتyou (F),” the verb form in the present 
can be written in one of two ways: َ أَنْتِ تَقْرَأينor َ“ أَنتِ تَقْرَئنيyou (F) read.”
Kasra
ُْلِسَججَ لَسَ / يto sit
ُعَرَفَ / يَعْرِفto know
ُرَجَ عَ / يَرْجِ عto return
ُغَسَ لَ / يَغْسِلto wash
12.1.1.1 Waaw-beginning verbs األَفعال الواوِيَّة
The initial waaw of such verbs in the present tense for the third person singu-
lar pronoun َ ,هُ وi.e. ُ ,يَوْجَ دis dropped. Instead, we obtain a yaa’ for this pronoun; 
the correct form is ُِدَج“ يhe finds.” This yaa’ is dropped for the other pronouns 
before the addition of their respective prefixes, as in the table below:

12.1.1.2 Hollow verbs اَألفْعال اجلَوْفاء
Hollow verbs have a long vowel in their middle in the past tense, namely  
’alif  .اThis ’alif is realized as a waaw in the present tense of some verbs; in 
other verbs it is realized as a yaa’. In the following table, we present the con-
jugation of َ“ زارto visit” in the present tense:

12.1.1.4 Doubled verbs األَفْعال الـمُ ضَ عَّفة
Verbs in this category maintain two identical consonants at their end, which 
are not separated by a vowel in the present tense. The vowel following the first 
consonant in some of these verbs can be a Dhamma or a kasra and, in a few 
cases, a fat-Ha. Examine the conjugation of the verb ُّ“ شَ كَّ / يَشُ كto doubt” in 
the table below:
Independent pronoun
Present tense form

12.1.2 Augmented verbs (Forms II–X) األَفْعالُ املَزيدَة
We present below a list of the remaining nine verb forms that were introduced 
in Chapters 1 and 11. In the heading of each form, we provide its present tense 
pattern. While َ فَعَلForm I verbs generally tend to be unpredictable with respect 
to their middle vowels, Form II ( َ–)فَعَّلForm X ( َ )اِسْ تَفْعَلverbs are entirely pre-
dictable with respect to the vowels that follow the prefixes, and also with respect 
to their penultimate vowels.
The present tense prefix for the respective pronouns is followed by Dhamma 
in the verb forms َ( فَعَّلForm II), َ( فاعَلForm III) and َ( أَفعَلForm IV). In a 
chart format, the present tense indicative in the singular is as follows:

12.2 present tense dual الفِعْل الـمُ ضارِع الـمُ ثَـنّى
Verbs in the present tense for the different pronouns in the dual have prefixes 
and suffixes attached to them to indicate the person involved in the act. There 
is no dual pronoun form for the first person. Instead, the plural pronoun ُ نَحْ ن
and its prefixes are used to represent the plural. We list below the prefixes and 
suffixes for the different pronouns that are used in the conjugation of the pre-
sent tense in the dual.

The only exception is the ending of indicative verbs for the pronoun ُ ,نَحْ نwhich 
ends with a Dhamma for all categories of tri-consonantal verbs except defective 
verbs ending with either a yaa’ or waaw.
The vowels following these prefixes are the same as those presented in the 
singular section above. Form I verbs always have a fat-Ha; Forms II, III and 
IV have a Dhamma. Forms V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X have a fat-Ha. Examine

12.3.1.1 Hollow verbs األفعال اجلَوْفاء
In the conjugation of hollow verbs, the middle vowel is shortened when the 
suffix begins with a consonant. This applies to the suffixes for َّ“ أَنْتـُنyou (F)”

12.3.1.2 Defective verbs األفْعال الـمُ عْـتَـلَّة اآلخِ ر
Defective verbs whose present tense ends with yaa’, such as “ شَ وَى / يَشْ ويto 
grill, roast,” or waaw, as in “ دَعا / يَدعوto invite,” show some change in the 
conjugation in the present tense for some pronouns.
In verbs ending with yaa’ such as “ شَ وَى / يَشْ ويto grill, roast,” for ex
ample, for the pronouns  أَنْتُمand ْ هُ مthe yaa’ is dropped, a waaw is called up, 
and the plural suffix َ ونis added. In other words, the present tense of defective 
verbs for the pronouns ْ أَنْتُمand ْ هُ مis represented in the orthography with  
two waaws.
For the pronouns َّ أَنـْتـُنand َّ هُ نthe yaa’ is maintained in the singular, and 
is followed by a nuun. Examine the conjugation of  شَ وَى / يَشْ ويin the follow-
ing table:
شَ وَى / يَشوي
Independent plural pronoun

In verbs ending with a waaw, such as “ دَعا / يَدْعوto invite,” for example, for 
the pronouns  أَنْتُمand ْ هُ مthe waaw in the singular verb is dropped before  
attaching the plural suffix َ .ونIn other words, the present tense of defective 
verbs for the pronouns  أَنْتُمand ْ هُ مis written with one waaw. For the pronouns 
َّ أَنـْتـُنand َّ هُ نthe original waaw in the singular is maintained, followed by  
the suffix َ نas illustrated in the table above. Now examine the conjugation of

12.3.1.3 Doubled verbs األفْعال الـمُ ضَ عَّـفَـة
When conjugating doubled verbs ( )األَفْعال الـمُ ضَ عَّفَةsuch as ُّ“ مَرَّ / يَمُ رto pass” in 
the present tense, geminated consonants (the doubled consonants marked by a 
shadda in the orthography) remain in their geminated form when the suffix begins 
with a vowel. This applies to the pronouns ْ نَحْ نُ ، أَنْتُمand ْ هُ مas in the table below.
When the suffix begins with a consonant, e.g. َ ,نthe geminated consonants 
must be separated by a vowel. This is to prevent the clustering of three con
sonants. The separation of the geminated consonants, only applies to the 
pronouns َّ أَنْتـُنand َّ.هُ ن
As noted previously, the middle vowel in some of these verbs is sometimes 
a Dhamma, as in ُّ“ مَرَّ / يَمُ رto pass through”; in other verbs it is a kasra, as in 
ُّ“ قَلَّ / يَقِلto become less, few,” or a fat-Ha, as in ُّ“ ظَ لَّ / يَظَ لto remain.” In 
the majority of verbs the middle vowel is a Dhamma. Examine the conjugation 
of the verb ُّ“ مَرَّ / يَمُ رto pass” in the following table:
ُّمَرَّ / يَمُ ر

resent tense negation «نَفْي الـمُ ضارِع «ال
Verbs in the present tense in the singular, dual and plural are negated by the 
use of  الplaced immediately in front of the verb. The verb remains unchanged, 
as in the examples below:
.ِيَذْهَبُ الطالِبُ إِىل اجلامِعَة
The student (M) goes to the university.
.ِال يَذْهَبُ الطّ الِبُ إِىل اجلامِعَة

The teachers (F, Pl) do not finish teaching today.

When a verb in a main clause expresses a wish, doubt, desire, fear, obligation, 
etc. the verb in the subordinate clause takes the subjunctive mood. This situation 
applies in the context of certain elements called “ أَدَوات  النَّصْ بsubjunctive 
particles,” which include ْ حَ تّى/ لـِ/ كَيand ْ ,لِكَ يall meaning “so that” or “in 
order to,” and express desire, reason, or a goal. Other subjunctive particles 
include ْ“ أَنso that” and the negative particle  .لَنThese particles must be  
immediately followed by a verb in the subjunctive. The difference between a 
verb in the present indicative and a verb in the subjunctive is a matter of their 
endings. A verb that undergoes this change is called “ فِعْل مَنصوبsubjunctive 
verb.” A list of verbs that trigger the subjunctive is included in this chapter. 
Note that the verb in the main clause may be in the past, present or future 
tense.
13.1 Singular 
ubjunctive verb   
 الـمُ فْرَد- الفِعْل الـمُ ضارِع الـمَنْصوب
Indicative present tense verbs in the singular always end with a Dhamma except 
in the verb form for the feminine pronoun ِ“ أَنْتyou (F),” which ends with 
-iina َ .ينHowever, when such verbs follow any of the subjunctive particles the 
Dhamma at the end must change to a fat-Ha. The suffix -iina - َ ينfor ِ أَنتchanges 
into -ii ي‏. In other words, the nuun must be dropped. These subjunctive  
particles are presented in some detail below:
13.1.1‏  لِـ‏، ْ لِكَ ي‏، ْ كَي‏،“ حَ تّىin order to,” “for the purpose of”
These particles must be followed immediately by a verb in the subjunctive 
mood. All forms of singular verbs in this mood end with a fat-Ha except the 
verb form for the pronoun ِ ,أَنْتwhich results in the dropping of the nuun َ.ن

Verbs expressing remembering, forgetting, etc.
ُ / يَتَذَكَّر‏َتَذَكَّرto remember
 / يَنْسى‏َ ِينَسto forget
An alternative to the subordinate clause after ْ أَنis using the maSdar, the verbal 
noun, of the verb instead of the subjunctive. (See Chapter 25 on maSdars.)
The following verbs convey an impersonal use. In other words, they cannot 
be conjugated with the various pronouns.
‏ِ لـ‏ُ / يُـمْكِن‏ِ لـ‏َأَمْكَ نto become possible
 عَىل‏ / يَنْبَغي‏اِنْبَغى عَىلto become necessary
‏ عَىل‏ُ / يَسْ هُل‏ عَىل‏َ سَ هُل‏
to become easy
‏ عَىل‏ُ / يَصْ عُب‏ عَىل‏َ صَ عُب‏
to become difficult
 / يَكْ في‏كَفىto suffice, to be sufficient
‏ عَىل‏ُ / يَلْزَم‏ عَىل‏َلَزِمto become necessary
ُالَه / ي‏َهالto be overwhelmed, to be overawed
 عَىل‏ُِبَج / ي‏ عَىل‏َوَجَ بto become necessary
As an illustration, the verb  عَىل‏َ“ وَجَ بto become necessary” requires the use 
of a designated noun to follow the preposition  عَىلas in the following example:
.‏ َ يَدْرُس‏ْ أَن‏ِ الطّ الِب‏ عَىل‏َوَجَ بIt was necessary for the student to study.
Similarly, if a suffixal pronoun designating a person is used, the pronoun must 
attach to the preposition, as in the following:
.‏َ تَذْهَب‏ْ أَن‏َ عَلَيْك‏ُِبَجيIt is necessary that you go.
.‏َ أُسافِر‏ْ أَن‏َّ َي عَل‏ُِبَجيI must travel.
.‏ َ يَدْرُس‏ْ أَن‏ِ عَلَيْه‏ُِبَجيHe must study.

. َأَرادَ صَ ديقي أَنْ يَأْكُلMy friend wanted to eat.
.‏َ الـمَتْحَ ف‏َ أَزور‏ْأُحِ بُّ أَنI like to visit the museum.
.‏ َ يَدْرُس‏ْ أَن‏ِ عَىل الطّ الِب‏ُِبَجيIt is necessary that the student study.
The nuun of the second person singular ِ أَنْتmust be dropped, as in the example below:
.‏ تَدْرُيس‏ْ أَن‏ِ عَلَيْك‏ُِبِجيYou (F) must study.
Note also in the above examples that the subjects of the verbs in the main 
clauses are the same as for the subjunctive verbs in the subordinate clauses. 
Subjects of verbs in the main clause can be different from those of the subjunctive 
verb in subordinate clauses, as in the following examples:
.‏ُأَرادَ صَ ديقي أَنْ تَأْكُلَ سوزان مَعَه
My friend‏ (M) wanted Suzanne to eat with him.
.‏َ الـمَتْحَ ف‏ صَ ديقتي‏َ تَزور‏ْأُحِ بُّ أَن
I [would] like my friend (F) to visit the museum.
.‏َ العَرَبِيَّة‏ُ الطّ الِب‏ َ يَدْرُس‏ْ أَن‏ُ األُستاذ‏ُيُريد
The teacher wants the student to study Arabic.
13.1.2.1 Expressions with ’an ْ أن‏َعِبارات مَع
In addition to the verbs listed above, ْ أَنis also used with certain fixed expres-
sions, including, but not restricted to, the following:
ْ أَن‏ِ األَحْ سَ ن‏َمِنit is better that
ْ أَن‏ِ الالزِم‏َمِنit is obligatory that
ْ األَفْضَ لِ أَن‏َمِنit is preferable that

These phrases are invariable. The subjunctive verb following ْ ,أَنhowever,  
indicates the intended person(s). Examine the following:
.‏ِ إِىل الـمَكتَبَة‏ُ الطُّ الّب‏َ يَذْهَب‏ْ أَن‏وريَّر الض‏َمِن
It is necessary that students go to the library.
.‏ِ إِىل الـمَكتبَة‏َ نَذهَب‏ْ أَن‏ِ الالزِم‏َمِن
It is obligatory that we go to the library.
.‏ً غَدا‏ تَذْهَبي‏ْ األَحْ سَ ن أَن‏َمِن
It is better that you (F) go tomorrow.
There are other phrases‏ containing the absolute negative particle  الfollowed 
by a noun in the accusative, as in the following:
ْمِن أَن ‏َّال بُدit is necessary that, it is obligatory that
‏ْ أَن‏َال عَجَ بit is not unusual that, it is not surprising that
ْ أَن‏َ غَرابَة‏الit is not unusual that, it is not surprising that
Examine the following examples:
.‏ أَصْ دِقائى‏َ أَزور‏ْ أَن‏ْال بُدَّ مِنIt is necessary that I visit my friends.
.‏ِ اجلامِعَة‏ يف‏َ يَعْمَل‏ْ أَن‏َال عَجَ بIt is not surprising that he works at  
the university.
Some prepositions, prepositional phrases, adverbial phrases, conditional  
particles and others require the use of ْ أَنand, consequently, the subjunctive 
verb form. Below is a partial list:

13.1.2.1.1 The phrases in the negative
The negative of the preceding phrases is formed by the use of َ ,لَيْسwhich 
remains invariable, regardless of the person intended, as in the following  
illustrative examples:
ْ أَن‏ِ األَحْ سَ ن‏َ مِن‏ َلَيْسit is not better that
ْ أَن‏ِ األَفْضَ ل‏َ مِن‏ َلَيْسit is not preferable that
ْلَيْسَ مِنَ الالزِمِ أَنit is not necessary that
ْوري أَنَّرلَيْسَ مِنَ الضit is not obligatory/necessary that
13.1.2.1.2 The phrases in the past tense
The preceding phrases can be used to refer to time in the past by the use of 
َ ,كانwhich remains invariable. The following examples are illustrative:
.‏ِ إِىل الـمَكتَبَة‏ُ الطّ الِب‏َ يَذهَب‏ْ أَن‏َ الواجِ ب‏َ مِن‏َكان
It was incumbent upon the student (M) to go to the library.

13.1.2.1.3 The phrases in the future tense
The preceding phrases can also be used to express the future by َ سَ وْفor َ سـ
“will, shall” followed by ُ .يَكونThe sequence of ُ سَ وْفَ  يَكونis invariable.  
Examine the following examples:
‏. تَذْهَبي‏ْ أَن‏ِّوريَّر الض‏َ مِن‏ُ يَكون‏َسَ وْف
It will be necessary that you (F) go.

13.2 Dual 
ubjunctive verb   
‏ الـمُ ثَنّى- ‏ الـمَنْصوب‏  الـمُ ضارِع‏  الفِعْل‏
The final nuun of dual verbs in the present tense preceded by any of ‏، ْ لِكَ ي‏، لِـ
 حَ تّى، لَن، أَنْ‏، ْ كَيis dropped, as in the examples below.
.‏ يُدَرِّسا‏ حَ تّى‏ِ الـمُ عَلِّامن‏َذَهَب
The teachers (M, D) went to teach.
‏. َ البَيْت‏ تُشاهِدا‏أَنْتُام رَجَ عْتُام حَ تّى
You‏ (M/F, D) returned to see the house.
.‏ يَدْرُسا‏ْ أَن‏ِ الطّ الِبان‏َأَراد
The students (M, D) wanted to study.
.‏ِ هذا الـمَطعَم‏ يف‏ لَنْ تَأْكُال‏ِالبِنْتان
The two girls will not eat in this restaurant.
.‏ القاهِرَة‏ يف‏ يَدْرُسا‏ْعادا إِىل مِص كَي
They (M, D) returned to Egypt to study in Cairo.
.‏ صَ ديقَتَهُام‏ تُقابِال‏ْ لِكَ ي‏ِ البَيْت‏َخَ رَجَ تا مِن
They (F, D) went out of the house to meet their friend (F).
The following examples are in the negative:
.أَرادَ الصَّ ديقانِ أَنْ ال يَدْرُسا
The two friends (M) wanted not to study.
.َخَ رَجَ تا مِنَ البـَيْتِ كَيْ ال تـَسْ تَقْبِال الزّائِر
They (F, D) left the house in order not to receive the visitor.
The nuun in ْ أَنwhen followed by laam as in  الgets assimilated by laam. The 
preceding first sentence can appear in the orthography as follows:
.أَرادَ الصَّ ديقانِ أَالّ يَدْرُسا
The two friends (M, D) wanted not to study.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

On the other hand, ْ كَيand  الin the second sentence above can be conjoined 
in the writing system, appearing as  ,كَيْالas in the following:
.َخَ رَجَ تا مِن البـَيْتِ كَيْال تـَسْ تَقْبِال الزّائِر
They (F, D) left the house in order not to receive the visitor.
13.3 Plural 
ubjunctive verb   
 اجلَمْع- ‏الفِعْل الـمُ ضارِع الـمَنْصوب
The final nuun of plural verbs in the present tense only drops when preceded 
by a long vowel. This applies to the verbs for the pronouns  أَنْتُم‏ “you (M, Pl)” 
and ْ“ هُ مthey (M, Pl)”, as in the examples below:
.‏َ تُشاهِدوا البَيْت‏ رَجَ عْتُم حَ تّى‏ْأَنْتُم
You (M, Pl) returned (in order) to see the house.
.‏ يُدَرِّسوا‏ حَ تّى‏َ الـمُ عَلِّمون‏َسافَر
The teachers (M, Pl) left (in order) to teach.
‏.َ القَديمَة‏َ اآلثار‏ ليُشاهِدوا‏ يُسافِروا‏ْأَحَ بّوا أَن
They (M, Pl) wanted to travel to see the old antiquities.
.‏َ يُشاهِدوا الفِلْم‏ْ أَن‏ُ الطُّ الّب‏َأَراد
The students (M, Pl) wanted to see the film.
.‏ يَدْرُسوا‏ْ أَن‏ُ الطُّ الّب‏ُِّبُحي
The students like to study.
.‏ يَعْمَلوا‏ْ عَىل الـمُ وَظَّ فنيَ أَن‏َلَزِم
The employees (M, Pl) had to work. (lit.: “It was obligatory  
for the employees to work.”)
In the orthography, when the nuun of the plural verb is dropped an ’alif is 
added. This ’alif  is not pronounced but rather functions as a device to indicate 
that the word in question is a verb.
If the plural verb in the present tense ends with a nuun not preceded by a 
long vowel, the nuun is maintained‏. This applies to the verb forms for the 
pronouns َّ“ أَنْتُـنyou (F, Pl)” and َّ“ هُ نthey (F, Pl),” as in the following examples:

Present tense subjunctive
197
.‏َ يَدرُسْ ن‏ حَ تَّى‏ِ إِىل الـمَكتَبَة‏َ ذَهَبْـن‏ُالطاّلِبات
The students (F, Pl) went to the library to study.
.‏َ يَلْعَبْـن‏ حَ تَّى‏ِ إِىل الـمَلْعَب‏َ رَجَ عْن‏ُالبَنات
The girls returned to the playground to play.
.‏َ تَدْرُسْ ن‏ حَ تّى‏َّ رَجَ عْتُـن‏َّأَنْتُـن
You (F, Pl) returned in order to study.
.‏َ يَدْرُسْ ن‏ْ أَن‏ِ عَىل الطّ الِبات‏َسَ هُل
It was easy for the students (F, Pl) to study.
13.4 
egation of t e 
ubjunctive  
 الفِعْل الـمَنْصوب‏نَفي
Negation of the subjunctive verb is accomplished by placing  الbetween the 
subjunctive particle and the verb. Examine the following:
.‏َ يَأَْكُل‏ ال‏ْ أَن‏ صَ ديقي‏َقَرَّر
My friend decided not to eat.
.‏َ اليَوْم‏َ الـمَتْحَ ف‏َ أَزور‏ ال‏ْ أَن‏ُأُفَضِّ ل
I prefer not to visit the museum today.
.‏َ يُسافِر‏ ال‏ْ أَن‏ِ عَىل الطّ الِب‏ُِبَجي
It is necessary that the student does not travel.
.ِيشَ يف املَطَ رْبَقِيَ يف البَيْتِ حَ تّى ال يَم
He stayed at home in order not to walk in the rain.
.َعَمِلْنا كُلَّ الواجِ باتِ كَيْال نُغْضِ بَ املُعَلِّمَة
We did all the homework in order not to anger the teacher.
The nuun in ْ أَنgets assimilated by the laam of the negative particle thus obtaining 
ّ ,أَالas in the following:
.ِمِنَ الالزِمِ عَلَيْكُ م أَالّ تَرْجِ عوا إىل هذا املَكان
It is incumbent upon you not to return to this place.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
198
On the other hand, writing ْ أَنand  الindependently is quite acceptable, as we 
see below:
.قَرَّرَ الصَّ ديقانِ أَنْ ال يُسافِرا
The two friends (M, D) decided not to travel.
. َّتـُحِ بُّ البِـنتانِ أَنْ ال تَدْرُسا الطِّ ب
The two girls do not like to study medicine.
.رَغِبوا أَنْ ال يـُسافِروا
They did not want to travel.
.وَجَ بَ عَلَيْهِم أَنْ ال يَرْجِ عوا
It was incumbent upon them not to return.
.َأَحَ بَّت الطّ الِباتُ أَنْ ال يُقابِلْنَ األُسْ تاذَة
The students (F) did not want to meet the teacher.

Putting a verb in Arabic into the future is a simple matter of using either of 
two particles, َ سَ وْفand  ,سَ ـin front of a verb in the present indicative tense. 
These “auxiliary” elements are the same in singular, dual or plural verbs. The 
negative of a verb in the future requires ْ لَنfollowed by the subjunctive.
14.1 Future tense singular  الـمُ فْرَد- الفِعْل الـمُ سْ تَقْبَل
The two particles expressing the future, َ سَ وْفand its shorter version َ ,سـmust 
be followed immediately by a verb in the present tense indicative. In the  
orthography, َ سَ وْفstands independent of the verb. However,  سَ ـmust attach 
to the verb following it, as in these examples:
.ًسَ وْفَ يُسافِرُ كَريم إِىل الـمَغْرِب غَدا
Kareem will travel to Morocco tomorrow.
.ًسَ يُسافِرُ كَريم إِىل الـمَغْرِبِ غَدا
Kareem will travel to Morocco tomorrow.
Classical Arabic grammarians belabored the difference between these two particles 
with respect to near future time when using  سَ ـas opposed to distant future 
time when using َ .سَ وْفIn Modern Standard Arabic, however, the difference 
in meaning between these particles is blurred.
The main verb must be marked for gender, as in the following pairs of sentences:
.َسَ وْفَ يَدْرُسُ سامي العَرَبِيَّةSami will study Arabic.
.َسَ يَدْرُسُ سامي العَرَبِيَّةSami will study Arabic.
.َسَ وْفَ تَدْرُسُ سامِية العَرَبِيَّةSamia will study Arabic.
.َسَ تَدْرُسُ سامِيَة العَرَبِيَّةSamia will study Arabic.

The future tense الـمُ سْ تَـقْبَل

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
200
The present tense could be used to express a future action or condition. This 
use holds especially when adverbs of time expressing the future are used, as 
in the following illustrative example:
.ًيُسافِرُ كَريم إِىل الـمَغْرِبِ غَداKareem will travel to Morocco tomorrow.
This new tendency in Arabic seems to be widely used in the media.
14.2 Future tense dual  الـمُ ثَـنّى- الفِعْل الـمُ سْ تَـقْبَل
The future tense dual is expressed by either َ سَ وْفor  سَ ـfollowed by the verb 
in the present tense. This verb combination is treated as one indivisible unit. 
Examine the following examples:
.ًسَ وْفَ يُسافِرُ الطّ الِبانِ إِىل سوريا غَدا
The two students (M) will travel to Syria tomorrow.
The verb preceding the  ,فاعِلthe performer, must always be in the singular. 
When the  فاعِلprecedes the verb, the verb must be conjugated to express the 
number and gender of the subject. َ سَ وْفor َ سـin this case must precede the 
conjugated dual verb, as in the following two sentences:
.ًالـمُ وَظَّ فَتانِ سَ وْفَ تَرجِ عانِ غَدا
The two employees (F) will return tomorrow.
.ٍاملُهَنْدِسانِ سَ وْفَ يَبْنِيانِ البِناءَ اجلَديدَ بَعْدَ سَ نَة
The two engineers will build the new building in a year’s time.
14.3 Future tense 
lural  اجلَمْع- الفِعْل الـمُ سْ تَقْبَل
The future tense plural is expressed by either َ سَ وْفor  سَ ـplus a verb in the present 
tense. When the verbs precede the performer of action, the  فاعِلmust always be 
in the singular as required by verbal sentences. Consider the following examples:
.ًسَ وْفَ يُسافِرُ الطُّ الّبُ إِىل سوريا غَدا
The students will travel to Syria tomorrow.
.سَ يُسافِرُ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ إِىل القاهِرَة
The teachers will travel to Cairo.

The future tense
201
When the  فاعِلprecedes the verb, the verb must be conjugated to agree with 
the  فاعِلin number and gender, as in the following examples:
.ًالـمُ وَظَّ فاتُ سَ وْفَ يَرْجِ عْنَ غَدا
The employees (F) will return tomorrow.
.ٍالـمُ هَنْدِسونَ سَ يَبْنونَ البِناءَ اجلَديدَ بَعْدَ سَ نَة
The engineers will build the new building in a year’s time.
As was stated elsewhere, Arabic strongly prefers to begin sentences with verbs. 
The preceding two sentences are preferably rendered as follows:
.ًسَ وْف تَرجِ عُ الـمُ وَظَّ فاتُ غَدا
The employees (F) will return tomorrow.
.ٍسَ يَـبْني الـمُ هَنْدِسونَ البِـناءَ اجلَديدَ بَعْدَ سَ نَة
The engineers will build the new building in a year’s time.
14.4 Future tense negation نَفْي الـمُ سْ تَقْبَل
14.4.1 Singular
Verbs in the future tense are negated by placing the particle ْ لَنimmediately in 
front of the present tense verb, thus changing it into the subjunctive. ْ لَنis one 
of several particles that must be followed by present tense verbs in the  
subjunctive. These particles and the subjunctive are presented in Chapter 13. 
Singular verbs following ْ لَنmust end with a fat-Ha. The only exception is the 
verb form for the pronoun ِ“ أَنتyou (F)”, which must end with a yaa’. Examine 
the following two pairs of examples in the singular, in which the first sentence 
is in the affirmative in the future, and the second is negated in the future:
.َسَ وْفَ يَدْرُسُ كَريم العَرَبِيَّةKareem will study Arabic.
.َلَنْ يَدْرُسَ كَريم العَرَبِيَّةKareem will not study Arabic.
When the  فاعِلis placed at the beginning, which one may encounter, the above 
sentences are rendered as follows:
.َكَريم سَ وْفَ يَدْرُسُ العَربِيَّةKareem will study Arabic.
.َكَريم لَنْ يَدْرُسَ العَرَبِيَّةKareem will not study Arabic.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
202
14.4.2 Dual
As in the singular, this is accomplished by the dropping of َ سَ وْفor َ سـand 
placing ْ لَنin front of the main verb. This results in the dropping of the final 
nuun, as in the following:
.َسَ وْفَ يَدْرُسُ الطّ الِبانِ العَرَبِيَّةThe students (M, D) will study Arabic.
.َلَنْ يَدْرُسَ الطّ الِبانِ العَرَبِيَّةThe students (M, D) will not study Arabic.
By placing  فاعِلat the beginning of the sentence, the main verb must express 
the gender and number of the dual noun, as in the following sexample:
.َالطّ الِبانِ لَنْ يَدْرُسا العَرَبِيَّة
The students (M, D) will not study Arabic.
.ِِكَةَّراملُوَظَّ فتانِ لَنْ تَعْمَال يف هذِهِ الش
The employees (F, D) will not work in this company.
14.4.3 Plural
In the presence of ْ لَنplural verbs lose their -nuun when the nuun is preceded 
by a long vowel. Consider the following:
.َسَ وْفَ يَعْقِدُ املُوَظَّ فونَ االِجْ تِامع
The employees will hold the meeting.
.َلَنْ يَعْقِدَ املُوَظَّ فونَ االِجْ تِامع
The employees will not hold the meeting.
.ًالـمُ دَرِّسونَ سَ يزورونَ الـمَدارِسَ غَدا
The teachers (M, Pl) will visit the schools tomorrow.
.ًالـمُ دَرِّسونَ لَنْ يَزوروا الـمَدارِسَ غَدا
The teachers (M, Pl) will not visit the schools tomorrow.

The future tense
203
However, if the nuun is not preceded by a long vowel, as in the case of verbs 
for the pronouns َّ أَنـْتـُنand َّ ,هُ نthe nuun is maintained, as in the following:
.ًالـمُ دَرِّساتُ سَ يَزُرْنَ الـمَدارِسَ غَدا
The teachers (F, Pl) will visit the schools tomorrow.
.ًالـمُ دَرِّساتُ لَنْ يَزُرْنَ الـمَدارِسَ غَدا
The teachers (F, Pl) will not visit the schools tomorrow.
.ًأَنْتُـنَّ سَ وْفَ تُقابِلْنَ الـمُ ديرَةَ غَدا
You (F, Pl) will meet the director tomorrow.
.ًأَنْتُـنَّ لَن تُقابِلْنَ الـمُ ديرَةَ غَدا
You (F, Pl) will not meet the director tomorrow.

The jussive  جَ زْمis a mood of the present tense that performs a variety of func-
tions in Arabic. It is used in negating the past tense with the negative particle 
ْ ,لَـمin conditional clauses, and in forming the imperative verb. This chapter 
will be devoted to  لand its impact on verbs. The imperative will be discussed 
in Chapter 17, and the conditionals in Chapter 20.
The verb in the jussive is referred to as ْزومَج .فِعْل  مIt is a foreshortened 
version of the present tense. Present tense indicative verbs become jussive by 
dropping their final vowel in the singular and their final nuun when preceded 
by a long vowel such as yaa’ in the singular (this mostly applies to the pronoun 
ِ ,)أَنْتor ’alif  (in the dual), or waaw (in the plural).
15.1 Negatio
 with lam «ْ َماَلنَّفْي بـِ «ل
Past tense verbs can be negated by placing  ماin front of them (see Chapter 
11). The negative particle ْ َم لis used for the same purpose but requires that the  
verb be in the jussive mood of the present tense. There is a slight difference in 
register but not in meaning. The negative particle  ماis used in formal written 
Arabic as well as everyday speech;  لon the other hand is used in written 
Arabic and formal speech only.
15.1.1 Verbs in the singular
Singular verbs in the present indicative ending with a Dhamma lose their Dhamma 
when they appear after ْ َم .لA sukuun replaces the Dhamma in the orthography. 
Examine the following examples:
. ِْ أَدْرُسْ أَمْسَمأَنا لI did not study yesterday.
.ْ تَرْجِ عْ مِنَ العِراقَمهِيَ لShe did not return from Iraq.

An -i sound is heard when jussive verbs are followed by definite nouns. In the 
orthography, a kasra is inserted at the end of the verb.
15.1.1.1 Hollow verbs
The use of ْ َم لbefore hollow verbs results in two things: (1) the shortening  
of the middle long vowel in the present tense form, and (2) the loss of the final 
nuun. The exceptions to this rule in the singular are the verb forms for the 
pronoun ِ .أَنْتAs verbs for ِ أَنْتhave long vowels ( yaa’ or waaw or ’alif  ), the 
“organic” long vowels in the present tense of these verbs must be maintained.

15.1.2 Verbs in the dual
Present tense verbs in the dual lose their final nuun when the verb is preceded 
by ْ َم .لConsider the following pairs of examples, in which the first sentence is 
in the past tense affirmative, the second in the negative:
. َالطّ الِبانِ دَرَسا الدَّرْسThe students (M, D) studied the lesson.
. َْ يَدْرُسا الدَّرْسَمالطّ الِبانِ لThe students (M, D) did not study the lesson.
.َِبَتا الـامءَرا شُمهThey (F, D) drank the water.
.ََبا الـامءْرْ تَشَما لُمهThey (F, D) did not drink the water.
.َِبْتُام القَهْوَةَرأَنْتُام شYou (M/F, D) drank the coffee.
.ََبا القَهْوَةْرْ تَشَمأَنْتُام لYou (M/F, D) did not drink the coffee.
In dual verbs for the first person ُ نَحْ نthe usual Dhamma at the end of the verb 
changes to sukuun, as in the following:
.ِِكَةَّرنَحْ نُ عَمِلْنا يف الشWe (M/F, D) worked at the company.
.ِِكَةَّرنَحْ نُ ل نَعْمَلْ يف الشWe (M/F, D) did not work at the company.
Note that the pronoun ُ نَحْ نis also used in the plural. In the preceding two 
sentences, the context clarifies that two persons are involved in the action.

15.1.3 Verbs in the plural
As in the dual, when plural verbs are used with ْ َم لthey lose their nuun when it 
is preceded by a long vowel. This applies to the pronouns “ أَنْتُمyou (M, Pl)” 
and ْ“ هُ مthey (M, Pl).” Examine the following pairs, in which the first is in 
the affirmative, the second in the negative:
. َالطُّ الّبُ دَرَسوا الدَّرْسThe students read the lesson.
. َْ يَدْرُسوا الدَّرْسَمالطُّ الّبُ لThe students (M, Pl) did not study the lesson.
.َِبْتُمُ القَهْوَةَرأَنْتُم شYou drank the coffee.
.ََبوا القَهْوَةْرْ تَشَمأَنْتُمْ لYou (M, Pl) did not drink the coffee.
Plural verbs that end with a nuun not preceded by a long vowel maintain the 
nuun. This applies only to two pronouns, namely َّ“ أَنـْتـُنyou (F, Pl),” and َّ هُ ن
“they (F, Pl),” as in the following examples:
.َِبْـتُـنَّ القَهْوَةَرأَنْـتُـنَّ شYou (F, Pl) drank the coffee.
.ََبْـنَ القَهوَةْرْ تَشَمأَنْـتُـنَّ لYou (F, Pl) did not drink the coffee.
.َِبْنَ القَهْوَةَرهُ نَّ شThey (F, Pl) drank the coffee.
.ََبْـنَ القَهْوَةْرْ يَشَمهُ نَّ لThey (F, Pl) did not drink the coffee.
The plural verb form for ُ“ نَحْ نwe (M/F, Pl)” ends with a sukuun, as in the 
following:
. ِنَحْ نُ أَكْمَلْنا الواجِ باتWe completed the homework assignments.
. ِْ نُكْ مِلِ الواجِ باتَمنَحْ نُ لWe did not complete the homework assignments.

In plural doubled verbs, the doubled consonant is separated by a vowel when 
the attached suffix begins with a consonant. This applies to the pronouns َّ أَنْتـُن

16.1 Past ense
We stated in Chapter 1 that verbs are of two types: (1) intransitive verbs 
 ,أَفعال الزِمَةi.e. verbs which do not require direct objects; the singular of this 
form is called  .فِعْل الزِمExamples of such verbs include َ“ ضَ حِ كto laugh,” َ عاد
“to come back,” َ“ رَجَ عto come back,” etc. And (2) transitive verbs  ,أَفْعال مُتَعَدِّيَة
which require direct objects, ِ .مَفْعولٌ بِهExamples include َِبَر“ شto drink,” َ أَكَل
“to eat,” etc.
The forms of verbs presented thus far are said to be in the active voice. 
Verbs can also assume another form referred to as  فِعْل مَبْنيّ لِلمَجْ هولin Arabic, 
or the passive voice. The passive voice form of verbs in Arabic is obtained by 
internal change in the vowel pattern within the verb. Past and present tenses 
of these verbs follow different patterns to form their passive voice, as will be 
illustrated below.
Passive voice forms are generally derived from transitive verbs. Intransitive 
verbs that require the presence of prepositions can be put in the passive voice. 
Verbs in the passive voice, like verbs in the active voice, can be in the singular, 
dual or plural. This form of verbs is used for two possible reasons: (1) lack of 
knowledge about the agentive noun  ,فاعِلi.e. the performer of the action, and 
(2) stylistic variation in writing. It must be noted that the use of the passive 
voice is more common in written than in spoken Arabic. Examine the follow-
ing pair of sentences:
. َكَتَبَ األُستاذُ الكِتابThe professor wrote the book.
. ُكُتِبَ الكِتابThe book was written.
In the first sentence above, the agentive noun, namely ُ ,األُستاذis known, whereas 
in the second sentence, information about who wrote the book is lacking. Note 
CH P
R 16
Passive voice الـمَبْنيُّ لِلْـمَجْ هول

Passive voice
217
also that in the two sentences above,  الكِتابin the first sentence is a direct 
object, ending with the accusative marker, a fat-Ha in singular nouns. In the 
second sentence, however,  الكِتابis in the nominative, ending with a Dhamma.
When transitive verbs are put in the passive voice, their direct objects must 
change their accusative endings into the nominative. In Arabic, the changed 
noun is referred to as  نائِب الفاعِلlit. “deputy of the  ,،فاعِلthe agentive noun.” 
In other words, the change in the status of the direct object entitles this changed 
noun to occupy the place of  .فاعِلThis explains why direct object nouns, when 
verbs are put in the passive, assume the nominative ending of the  فاعِلindicated 
by the Dhamma in singular nouns.
In dual nouns,  نائِب  الفاعِلis marked by ِان-. And in regular masculine  
plural nouns,  نائِب الفاعِلis generally marked by َون-. Regular feminine plural 
nouns  نائِب الفاعِلare marked by ٌات-. In irregular plural nouns, the  نائِب الفاعل
is marked orthographically by a Dhamma and phonetically by the sound -u.
The following sets of sentences in the past tense illustrate these points. In 
each set the first sentence is in the active voice, the second in the passive:
1. Singular:
. َِ الطالِبُ الزُّجاجَ أمْسَركَسThe student broke the glass yesterday.
. َِ الزُّجاجُ أَمْسِركُسThe glass was broken yesterday.
.ِشاهَدَ الطُّ الّبُ األُستاذَ يف اجلامِعَةThe students saw the professor at  
the university.
.ِشُ وهِدَ األُسْ تاذُ يف اجلامِعَةThe professor was seen at the university.
2. Dual:
. َِ الطالِبانِ الزُّجاجَ أَمْسَركَسThe students (M, D) broke the glass  
yesterday.
. َِ الزُّجاجُ أَمْسِركُسThe glass was broken yesterday.
.ِشاهَدَ الطُّ الّبُ األُستاذَيْنِ يف اجلامِعَةThe students saw the professors  
(M, D) at the university.
.ِشُ وهِدَ األُسْ تاذانِ يف اجلامِعَةThe professors (M, D) were seen at the  
university.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

.ِشاهَدَ الطُّ الّبُ األُسْ تاذَتَيْـنِ يف اجلامِعَةThe students saw the professors (F, D)  
at the university.
.ِشُ وهِدَتِ األُسْ تاذَتَانِ يف اجلامِعَةThe professors (F, D) were seen at  
the university.
Recall that when the subject precedes the verb, the latter must indicate the 
number of the noun as well as its gender, as in the following examples:
.ِاألُسْ تاذانِ شُ وهِدا يف اجلامِعَة
The professors (M, D) were seen at the university.
.ِاألُسْ تاذَتانِ شُ وهِدَتا يف اجلامِعَة
The professors (F, D) were seen at the university.
In the preceding first sentence, the subject, a masculine, dual noun, is placed 
before the verb, thus making it necessary for the verb to agree with the noun 
in gender and number. On the other hand, the subject that begins the second 
sentence is feminine and dual, which explains why the verb  شوهِدَتاis feminine 
and dual.
3. Plural:
.ِشاهَدَ الطُّ الّبُ الـمُ عَلِّمنيَ يف اجلامِعَة
The students saw the teachers (M, Pl) at the university.
.ِشُ وهِدَ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ يف اجلامِعَة
The teachers (M, Pl) were seen at the university.
.ِشاهَدَ الطُّ الّبُ الـمُ عَلِّامتِ يف اجلامِعَة
The students saw the teachers (F, Pl) at the university.
.ِشُ وهِدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّامتُ يف اجلامِعَة
The teachers (F, Pl) were seen at the university.
As in the dual above, when the subject precedes the verb, the verb must agree 
with the subject in number and gender, as in the following:

Passive voice
219
.ِالـمُ عَلِّمونَ شُ وهِدوا يف اجلامِعَة
The teachers (M, Pl) were seen at the university.
.ِالـمُ عَلِّامتُ شُ وهِدْنَ يف اجلامِعَة
The teachers (F, Pl) were seen at the university.
It should be mentioned that whereas  ,فاعِلthe performer, is not expressed  
in passive structures, certain phrases are typically used to indicate the doer,  
or the agent who executed the action. Such phrases, which may have been 
introduced into Modern Standard Arabic due to translation from Western  
languages, include ِ“ بِقَلَمby the pen of” (restricted to verbs expressing writing), 
ِ“ عَىل يَدby/on the hand of,” ِ“ مِن قِبَلby,” or ِ“ مِن طَ رَفby” (lit. “from the side 
of”), ِ“ مِنْ  جانِبfrom the side of,” and “ مِن  لَدُ نby.” Thus, one encounters 
examples like the following:
. ِكُتِبَتِ الرِّسالةُ بِقَلَمِ الرَّئيس
The letter was written by the president. (lit. “by the president’s pen”)
.ِمُنِحَ الكاتِبُ اجلائِزَةَ مِنْ طَ رِفِ احلُكومَة
The writer was awarded the prize by the government.
We mentioned above that verbs in the passive voice undergo internal change 
in their vowel patterns. The passive voice in past tense verbs requires the  
initial consonant to always be followed by a Dhamma. If the verb has a long 
vowel as in َ فاعَلand َ تَفاعَلforms, a waaw is used instead of a Dhamma. The 
penultimate consonant must always be followed by a kasra. Examine the follow
ing lists of verbs in the past tense in the active and passive voice:

Passive voice
221
Note that َ اِنْفَعَلand َّ اِفْعَلverb forms cannot be put in the passive voice due to 
the fact that they are not transitive verbs. Additionally, some verbs are often, 
but not always, used in the passive voice. Examples include َ“ وُلِدto be born, 
َ“ شُ فِيto recover from illness,” and َّ“ جُ نto be or become insane, mad, madly 
excited,” as in the following:
.َد يف مَرّاكِشْموُلِدَ أَحAhmad was born in the city of Marrakesh.
.ِشُ فِيَ الـمَريضُ مِنْ مَرَضِ هThe sick person recovered.
.جُ نَّ جُ نونُهُ عِنْدَما سَ مِعَ اخلَبHe became madly upset when he heard  
the news.
Hollow verbs form their passive voice in the past tense by changing the middle 
’alif into a yaa’. The use of the yaa’ instead of a kasra is to compensate for the 
missing third consonant. Thus, in the active voice َ“ زارto visit” and َ“ قالto say” 
become َ“ زيرhe/it was visited,” and َ“ قيلit was said,” respectively. It must be noted 
that the active voice form of such verbs is commonly used. However, the passive 
voice form َّ“ قيلَ إنit was said that” is rather common, especially when the source 
of “reporting” or “news” is not known. Examine the following example:
.ِقيلَ إنَّ الرَّئيسَ اِجْ تَمَعَ مَعَ بَعْضِ الوُزَراء
It was mentioned that the president met with some ministers.
16.1.1 Defective verbs
In the past tense, defective verbs form their passive voice by placing a Dhamma 
after the first consonant and a kasra before the final consonant which is changed 
into a yaa’. This causes some adjustment in the orthography. Instead of the 
regular ’alif in verbs that are normally written with a final ’alif, or an ’alif  
maqSuura, the passive voice of such verbs in the past tense is written with  
a yaa’, as in the following examples:

Examine the following sentences, which illustrate some of these passive verbs:
.ِدُعِيَ الطُّ الّبُ إىل حَ فْلَةِ األُسْ تاذThe students were invited to the teacher’s  
party.
.سُ مِّيَتِ البِنْتُ لَيْىلThe girl was named Laila.
.َِ يف هذِهِ القَضِ يَّةِيقُضThis case was decided.
16.1.2 Doubled verbs
In the past tense, doubled verbs, on the other hand, begin with a Dhamma 
after the first consonant; the final vowel in this case is a fat-Ha. For example, 
we obtain َّ“ عُ دhe/it was counted, considered” from َّ عَدand “ شُ كَّ يفhe/it was 
doubted,” from  شَ كَّ يفand so on. Examine the following sentence:
. ِشُ كَّ يف قَوْلِ هذا الرَّجُ لThe words of this man were doubted.
.ٍحُ لَّت هَذهِ املُشْ كِلَةُ بِسُ هولَةThis problem was easily solved.
16.2 P esent ense الـمُ ضارِع الـمَبْنيّ لِلمَجْ هول

The imperative form of verbs is used to give someone, an addressee, a command, 
an order, or a request to perform an act. There are two types of commands: 
(1) direct and (2) indirect.
The direct imperative is the form of a verb used to ask the addressee to perform 
an act. Imperative verb forms are generally used with the second person pronouns, 
singular, dual, or plural, as in the following for the verb َ“ كَتَبto write”:
ُكَتَبَ / يَكْ تُب

The indirect imperative conveys a suggestion, a request or a milder form of 
command directed to an addressee to perform an act. It is generally used with 
the third person singular, dual or plural pronoun. The indirect imperative can 
also be used with the first and second person pronouns. It is often translated 
as “had better” in English.
17.1 Fo m I Im
v  
bs  األمْر- صيغَة فَعَل
Verbs of the َ فَعَلpattern such as َِبَر ش‏، َ كَتَب‏، َ دَرَسbegin with ُ اor ِا . The choice 
of ُ اor ِ اis determined by the penultimate vowel in the present tense form of 
the verb. It is therefore very necessary to learn the present tense form of verbs 
accurately. For example, the imperative of ُ / يَكْ تُب‏َ كَتَبis .اُكْتُب
If the middle vowel in the present tense of َ فَعَلverbs is a fat-Ha or a kasra, 
the imperative verb form must begin with a kasra. In the orthography, the  
expected hamza is not written; an ’alif followed by a kasra ِ( اprosthetic ’alif ) is 
used, as in َُبْر / يَش‏َِبَر:ش

Recall that the final ’alif in the plural verb in the masculine  ارشبواis not pro-
nounced. It is only used in the orthography to mark the word as a verb.
If the penultimate vowel in the present‏ tense of َ فَعَلis a kasra, as in

17.1.2 Middle vowel hamza
When ‏َ فَعَلverbs have an initial hamza, as in ُ أَكَلَ / يَأْكُلor ُ ,أَخَ ذَ / يَأْخُ ذthe hamza

17.1.3 Waaw-beginning verbs
In waaw-beginning verbs as in ُ  /  يَصِ ف‏َ“ وَصَ فto describe,” the hamza that  
usually begins the imperative form does not appear. The vowel following the 
first consonant in the imperative form takes the middle vowel of the present 
tense of the verb for َ.هُ و
An example of when the middle vowel is a kasra, as in ُ / يَصِ ف‏َ“ وَصَ فto 
describe,” is below:

17.1.4 Hollow verbs
As with the waaw-beginning verbs, there is no initial hamza in the imperative 
of the َ فَعَلform of hollow verbs. The imperative of hollow verbs such as  
َ ,زارَ ,عادand َ نامresults in the shortening of the long vowel of the present

17.1.5 Defective verbs
The prosthetic ’alif ِ اis followed by either a kasra if the indicative present tense 
is a yaa’ as in  بَنى / يَبْنيor a Dhamma if the indicative present tense is a waaw:

The imperative form for the pronoun ‏َ أَنْت‏ must end with a kasra in verbs 
whose present tense ends with yaa’. The pronoun ِ أَنْتin the imperative form 
must end with a yaa’. The dual pronoun  أَنْتُامmust maintain the yaa’ followed 
by an ’alif as the dual marker. The masculine plural pronoun ْ أَنتُم‏ drops the 
yaa’ and must end with a waaw, followed by an ’alif  in the orthography. Finally, 
the feminine plural pronoun َّ أَنـْتـُنmust end with a yaa’ followed by َ .نExamine

plural pronoun ْ أَنْتُمmust end with a waaw, also followed by an ’alif  in the 
orthography to indicate that the word is a verb. Finally, the feminine plural

17.1.6 Doubled verbs
Like waaw-beginning and hollow verbs, double verbs in Form I imperatives do 
not have a prosthetic ’alif  .

Imperative verbs
237
The imperative form of doubled verbs always ends with a double consonant. 
For the pronoun َ أَنْت‏ a fat-Ha follows the doubled consonants. For the pronoun 
ِ أَنتa yaa’ follows the doubled consonants. For the dual pronoun  أَنْتُامan ’alif 
follows the doubled consonants. For the plural pronoun ْ  أَنتُم‏ a waaw must  
follow the doubled consonant, followed in the orthography by an ’alif. The 
imperative form of defective verbs for the pronoun َّ أَنْتُـنtakes a different form, 
as in the table below for the verb ُّ / يَرُد‏َّ“ رَدto reply, to return, to respond”:
ُّرَدَّ / يـَرُد
Singular:
Independent pronoun

cal consonant of the doubled verb must be separated by a vowel.

As was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, indirect imperatives convey 
suggestions to perform an act. Whereas the direct imperative applies only to 
the second person pronouns ‏ِ  أَنْت‏ and َ أَنتand their plural and dual forms 
‏، َّ أَنْـتُـن‏, ْ أَنْـتُـمand ‏ ,أَنْـتُـامthe indirect imperative applies to all personal pronouns‏. 
This includes the first person plural pronouns  أَناand ُ نَحْ نand the third person 
singular pronouns  هُ وand َ هِيin addition to their dual counterparts اُم( هM) 
and اُم( هF) and plural forms ْ هُ مand َّ.هُ ن
Indirect imperatives are formed by the use of ِ لـin front of the present tense 
form of the verb in the jussive.‏ In other words, the verb must end with a sukuun 
or a long vowel (’alif, waaw, or yaa’). The only exceptions are the forms for 
َّ أَنْـتُـنand َّ هُ نthat we see in the following:
First person pronouns:
َْذْهَبِلأI had better go
ْلِنَذْهَبlet’s go
Second person pronouns:
ْلِتَذْهَبyou (M) had better go or you go
لِتَذْهَبيyou (F) had better go or you go
لِتَذْهَباyou (M/F, D) had better go

!ال تَكْ ـتُباDon’t write (M/F, D)!

17.5 W
n ngs التَّحذير
There is another way of expressing  النَّهيor warning  ,التَّحذيرwhich is less 
frequently used in Modern Standard Arabic. The particle  إِيّاplus a pronoun in 
one of the second person suffixal forms functions as a warning when followed 
by the content of the warning. This can be provided by a dependent clause or 
a noun. It may be followed by ْ أَنfollowed by the subjunctive verb form, as in 
the following examples:

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
246
! َ تَلْعَب‏ْ أَن‏َإِيّاكBe careful (M, Sg) not to play.
! تَلْعَبي‏ْ أَن‏ِإيّاكBe careful (F, Sg) not to play.
! تَلْعَبا‏ْإيّاكُام أَنBe careful (M/F, D) not to play.
! تَلْعَبوا‏ْ أَن‏ْإيّاكُمBe careful (M, Pl) not to play.
! َإِيّاكُنَّ أَنْ تَـلْعَبـْنBe careful (F, Pl) not to play.
 إِيّاand the personal suffixal pronouns can be followed by ْ ,مِنwhich is followed 
by the subjunctive particle ْ أَنand a subjunctive verb. Thus we can obtain the 
following as illustration:
! َإِيّاكَ مِنْ أَنْ تَلْعَبBeware (M, Sg) of playing!
‏! ِْمِلوا الواجِ باتُه ت‏ْ أَن‏ْإِيّاكُم مِنNever forget your (M, Pl) homework!
ْ أَنplus the subjunctive verb form can be substituted with a maSdar preceded 
by a waaw. Thus  تَلْعَب‏ْ أَن‏َ إِيّاكis equivalent in meaning to َ واللَعِب‏َ إِيّاك‏“take 
care not to play” or “be careful not to play.”
 إِيّاplus the personal pronoun suffix can be followed by ْ مِنin addition to 
maSdar, as in:
‏! اللَعِب‏َ مِن‏َإِيّاكBeware (M, Sg) of playing!
Furthermore,  إِيّاplus the personal pronoun can be followed by a noun or a 
maSdar preceded by a waaw  ,وas in the following examples:
!إِيّاكُم والكَ ذِبBeware of lying!
!إيّاكِ وَجَ ليسَ السُّ وءBeware of bad companionship!
The waaw can be dropped only with maSdars, as in the following:
!َإِيّاكُم الفاحِ شَ ةBeware of committing evil things!
!َإِيّاكِ الكَ ذِبBeware of lying!

When َ كانwas first introduced, its function was to transform equational sen-
tences from the present to the past tense (see Chapter 10). َ كانhas another 
function in Modern Standard Arabic. In the following discussion, َ كانis 
followed by an indicative verb in the present tense to express (1) a state in  
the past, (2) a past habitual action, (3) a past continuous event, or (4) the  
past perfect (also referred to as the pluperfect). We shall discuss each of these 
functions below:
18.1 A St te in the p
t
There are certain verbs in Arabic that denote a quality or a condition but not 
an action. In English they are known as stative verbs. Such verbs include, for 
example, verbs of knowing and understanding, as in َ“ فَهِمto understand,” ‮ 
َعَرَف‬ “to know,” or verbs of liking or loving, as in َّ“ أَحَ بto like, to love,” َ رَغِب
“to desire, to want,” َأَراد‬ ‮“to want, to wish,” etc. When َ كانis followed by one 
of these verbs in the present tense, its use indicates a state or a condition  
in the past. This combination is equivalent to the English “used to.” Examine 
the following examples:
.َكانَ يَعْرِفُ الـمُ شْ كِلَةHe used to know the problem.
.َكانَ يَفْهَمُ الـمُ شْ كِلَةHe used to understand the problem.
.َكُنْتُ أُحِ بُّ الـمُ وسيقى العَرَبِيَّةI used to like Arabic music.
18.2 
t 
bitu l Action
Action verbs in the past tense express the occurrence of an event or action  
in the past. When َ كانis followed by the present tense of action verbs such as 
A
R 18
Past continuous tense  
ّالفِعْل الـاميض الـمُ سْ تَمِر

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
248
َ“ أَكَلto eat” or َِبَر“ شto drink,” this usage expresses a past habitual action,  
in the sense that someone used to perform a certain action in the past as  
a habit. Examine the following:
.ِكانَتْ تَزورُهُ يف اجلامِعَةShe used to visit him at the university.
.ِكانَ يَلْعَبُ كُرَةَ القَدَمHe used to play soccer.
. ََ بُ احلَليبْركُنْتُ أَشI used to drink milk.
18.3 
t 
ontinuou
َ كانfollowed by a present tense verb can also convey the notion of an action 
that was progressing in the past. This notion is usually conveyed when another 
event or action intersects, as in the following examples.
.‮ُْلِسُ يف الـمَقْهى عِنْدَما شاهَدتُهَجكانَ ي
He was sitting in the café when I saw him.
.اُهكانَت تَدْرُسُ هذا الصَّ باحَ عِنْدَما زُرْت
She was teaching this morning when I visited her.
ماذا كُنْتَ تَعمَلُ يف الـمَكتَبَةِ عِنْدَما رَأَيْتُكَ ؟
What were you doing in the library when I saw you?
It should be mentioned that it is more common to begin such sentences with 
adverbial clauses of time such as  ,حينَام، عِنْدَما، لَـمas in the following:
.ْلِسُ يف املَقْهىَجعِنْدَما شاهَدْتُهُ كانَ ي
When I saw him, he was sitting in the café.
. ُا هذا الصَّ باح كانَتْ تُدَرِّسُهحينَام زُرْت
When I visited her this morning, she was teaching.
Furthermore, when the phrase َ كانis followed by a present tense verb in the 
main clause, this clause can be immediately followed by a verb in the present 
tense, as in the following example:
.‮ِكانَت تُراسِ لُهُ مِنَ العِراق، تَتَحَ دَّثُ عن الـمَشاكِل
She used to correspond with him from Iraq, discussing problems.

Past continuous tense
249
The above sentence has undergone some truncation. In other words, َ كان
in front of ُ تَتحَ دَّثhas not been repeated, perhaps for economy and style.  
Optionally, it can be repeated, of course, as in the following:
.‮ِكانَت تُراسِ لُهُ مِنَ العِراق وكانَت تَتَحَ دَّثُ عَنِ الـمَشاكِل
She used to correspond with him from Iraq and discuss the problems.
Similarly, the following sentence has undergone truncation as well.
.‮ََبُ الشايْرْتَمِعُ يف الـمَقاهي مَعَ أصْ دِقائِهِ، يَلْعَبُ الوَرَقَ وَيَشَجكانَ ي
He used to meet in cafés with his friends, play cards and drink tea.
In other words, َ كانhas been deleted in front of the present tense verbs ُ يَلْعَب
and َُبْر يَشrespectively.
18.3.1 Past continuous tense negation  
 النَّفي- ّ الـمُ ستَمِر‮ الفِعْل الـاميض‮
There are three ways of negating the past continuous in Arabic. The first two 
are to negate َ كانas any past tense verb, using either  ماor ْ َم( لsee Chapter 11 
on past tense; Chapter 15 on jussive). The third way is to negate the present 
tense verb following َ.كان
Recall that َ كانcan simply be negated by placing  ماimmediately before it, 
as in the following example:
‬.‮َما كانَ يَعْرِفُ اإلنْكليزِيَّة  He used to not know English.
The preceding sentence in Arabic can be said about someone who is no longer 
with us. It can also have another reading. One can also infer from this sentence 
that while that person did not know English in the past, he does now, or he 
knew it at another stage in life. In other words, the above sentence implies the 
following meanings:
‬.‮َما كانَ يَعْرِفُ اإلنْكليزِيَّةَ وَلَكِنَّهُ يَعْرِفُها اآلن
He used to not know English but he knows it now.
.ما كانَ يَعْرِفُ اإلنكليزيَّة وَلكِنَّهُ عَرَفَها فيام بَعْد
He used to not know English but he learned it at a later stage.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
250
The structure above can also be negated by the use of ْ َم لplaced in front of the 
present tense jussive of the verb َ ,كانas in the following:
‬.‮َْ يَكُ نْ يَعْرِفُ اإلنْكليزِيَّةَملHe used to not know English.
Such sentences can also be negated by the use of  الbetween the verb َ كانand 
the present tense verb following it, as in the following example:
.كانَ ال يَعْرِفُ اإلِنْكِليزِيَّةHe used to not know English.
Or,
It used to be that he did not know English.
This form of negation can be found in Quranic Arabic as well as in Modern 
Standard. We will cite a couple of Quranic verses to illustrate this usage:
. ُإِنَّهُ كانَ ال يُؤْمِن
He used to not believe.
.ُكانوا ال يَتَناهَوْنَ عَنْ مُنْكَ رٍ فَعَلوه
They used to not cease from a bad act they were in the habit of doing.

This tense is used to indicate two events that happened at different times in 
the past with one having happened prior to the other. Such events are generally 
organized in sequence by two clauses. Such a structure requires the particle 
ْ ,قَدone of whose functions is to indicate that an action had already been com-
pleted before another. ْ قَدimmediately precedes the past tense verb indicating 
the already completed action; it could also be preceded by َ وَكانor َ .كانConsider 
the following examples:
. َرَجَ عَ أَخي مِنَ القاهِرة وكانَ قَدْ أَكْمَلَ دِراسَ تَهُ اجلامِعيَّةَ هُ ناك
My brother returned from Cairo and he had completed his  
university study there.
.َذَهَبَ الطالِبُ إىل مَكْ تَبِ األُستاذِ فَوَجَ دَهُ قَدْ غادَر
The student went to the professor’s office and found out that  
he had already left.
The times of events are indicated by time adverbial phrases such as  قَبْلَ أَنْ ، قَبْلَم
“before” and “ بَعْدَ أَنْ ، بَعْدَماafter.” As these phrases organize the sequence of 
past events, verbs following them must be in the past tense.
The main clause containing َ كانmust be followed by the particle ْ قَد
and the past tense of the verb expressing the action that happened first. The 
past tense verb following َ كانmust be conjugated to indicate the person(s)  
involved in the events with respect to number and gender. The subordinate 
clause following َ قَبْلor امَ قَبْـلmust have a verb in the past tense. Examine the 
following examples:
‬.‮ِّكانَ الطّ الِبُ قَدْ أَكَلَ قَبْلَم ذَهَبَ إىل الصَّ ف
The student (M) had eaten before he went to class.

. ُكانَتِ الطَّ بيبَةُ قَدْ وَصَ لَتِ إِىل الـمُ سْ تَشْ فى قَبْلَ أَنْ أُدْخِ لَ الـمَريض
The physician (F) had arrived at the hospital before the  
patient was admitted.
‬.‮َُ املُديرَركانَ الـمُ ساعِدونَ قَدْ وَصَ لوا قَبْلَم حَ ض
The assistants (M, Pl) had arrived before the director came.
The positions of the two clauses are not rigid. In other words, the subordinate 
clause can be placed at the beginning of the sentence. The above examples are 
duplicated below to illustrate this flexibility:
‬.‮َقَبْلَم ذَهَبَ إِىل الصَّ فِّ كانَ الطّ الِبُ قَدْ أَكَل
Before he went to class, the student had [already] eaten.
.قَبْلَ أَنْ أُدْخِ لَ املَريضُ كانَتِ الطَّ بيبَةُ قَدْ وَصَ لَت إىل املُسْ تَشْ فى
Before the patient was admitted, the doctor had [already]  
arrived at the hospital.
‬.‮َ املُديرُ كانَ الـمُ ساعِدونَ قَدْ وَصَ لواَرقَبْلَم حَ ض
Before the director came, the assistants had [already] arrived.
The time adverb  قَبْلَمcan be replaced by عِنْدَما‬ ‮“when.” Thus the sentences 
above can be rendered in the following way to convey the same meaning:
‬.‮ِّكانَ الطّ الِبُ قَدْ أَكَلَ عِنْدَما ذَهَبَ إىل الصَّ ف
The student (M) had [already] eaten when he went to class.
. ُكانَتِ الطَّ بيبَةُ قَدْ وَصَ لَت إىل املُسْ تَشْ فى عِنْدَما أُدْخِ لَ الـمَريض
The doctor (F) had [already] arrived at the hospital when  
the patient was admitted.
‬.‮َُ الـمُ ديرَركانَ الـمُ ساعِدونَ قَدْ وَصَ لوا عِنْدَما حَ ض
The assistants had [already] arrived when the director arrived.

This structure can be used without necessarily requiring the adverbial particle 
 ,عِنْدَماas in the following more commonly used example:
.َاِسْ تَقْبَلَ الرَّئيسُ أَمريَ دَوْلَةِ الكُ وَيْت. وكانَ األَمريُ قَدْ وَصَ لَ إىل دِمَشْ ق اللَيْلَةَ املاضِ يَة
The president welcomed the emir of Kuwait, who had arrived in 
Damascus the previous night.
Moreover, instead of the phrase‬ ‮قَبْلَم‬ ‮and the past tense verb following it, maSdars 
can be used to convey the same meaning, as in the following sentences:
‬.‮ِّكانَ الطّ الِبُ قَدْ أَكَلَ قَبْلَ الذَّهابِ إىل الصَّ ف
The student (M) had [already] eaten before going to class.
. ِكانَتِ الطَّ بيبَةُ قَدْ وَصَ لَت إىل املُسْ تَشْ فى قَبْلَ إِدْخالِ الـمَريض
The doctor (F) had already arrived before admitting the patient.
‬.‮ِكانَ الـمُ ساعِدونَ قَدْ وَصَ لوا قَبْلَ حُ ضُ ورِ الـمُ دير
The assistants had [already] arrived before the director’s arrival.
.وتْيرَيا لَيْىل، كُنْتِ قَدْ وُلِدْتِ قَبْلَ اِنْتِقالِ العائِلَةِ إىل ب
Laila, you had been born before the family moved to Beirut.
ام؟َهَلْ كُنْتَ قَدْ أَكَلْتَ قَبْلَ الذَّهابِ إىل السّ ين
Had you eaten before you went to the movies?

Conditional sentences consist of two components: (1) the subordinate clause 
that contains the conditional particle, called in Arabic  ,جمُ ْلَة الشرَّ ْطand (2) the 
main clause that contains the consequence of the condition, known in tradi-
tional Arabic grammar as “ جَ واب الشرَّ ْطthe result clause.”  جمُ ْلَة الشرَّ ْطclauses 
always begin with a conditional particle. Conditional sentences may express 
possible outcomes or unrealizable ones, depending on the particle used.
There are several conditional particles ( )أَدَوَات الشرَّ ْطin Arabic, listed below; 
each will be discussed separately: ،امُ إِذا، لَوْ، إِنْ ، مَنْ ، ما، مَهْام، أَيْنَام، مَتى، أَيُّ ، حَ يْث
 كَيْفَام، أَيّانَand ىَّ .أَنOf this list, َ أَيّانand  أَنّىare not commonly used in Modern 
Standard Arabic as they tend to be archaic; and, therefore, they will not be 
discussed in this work.
These particles can be divided into three categories:
1.
Particles that can be followed by verbs in varying tenses. This includes  إذا
“if,” ْ“ لَوwere,” “had been.”
2.
Particles that must be followed by jussive verbs زومَج فِعْل مonly (see Chapter 15 
on Jussive). This includes the following: “ مَتىwhen, whenever,” ْ“ مَنwho-
ever,” “ ماwhatever,” “ مَهْامwhatever,”  أَيْنَامor َ“ أَيْنwherever,” امُ“ حَ يْثwherever,” 
“ كَيْفَامhowever,” and ُّ“ أَيwhichever.”
3.
Different verb tenses besides the jussive form are permissible in the case  
of ْ“ إِنif.”
20.1 Particles with Varying enses
20.1.1 “ إِذاif”
“ إذاif” always begins the conditional clause; it must be followed by either  
a verb in the past tense or a verb negated by the jussive particle ْ َم .لThe use of 
P

 إذاconveys the idea of a possible condition and some degree of probability;  
it could be equivalent to either “if” or “when.”
.َ األَهْرامُرْتُ إِىل القاهِرَة زُإِذا سافَرْت
If I travel to Cairo, I shall visit the pyramids.
The verb in the result clause can be in the past. Other verb tenses such as the 
future tense or imperative mood, for example, are also possible. The verb unit 
in this situation must be introduced by َ .فـConsider the following examples:
.َ األَهْرامُإِذا سافَرْنا إِىل القاهرة فَسَ وْفَ نَزور
If we travel to Cairo, we will visit the pyramids.
.ِ يف االمْتِحانُإِذا دَرَسْ نا كَثرياً فَسَ نَنْجَ ح
If we study hard, we will pass the exam.
The imperative verb form can also be used in the result clause; it must also 
begin with َ ,فـas in the following example:
.ًإِذا أَرَدْتَ العَمَلَ فَقَدِّم طَ لَباً غَدا
If you want to work, submit an application tomorrow.
The result clause can contain an equational sentence whose head is a pronoun. 
The pronoun must have َ فـprefixed to it, as in the following:
. ٌْطِئُخوَ مُإِذا قالَ هذا فَه
If he said this, he is wrong.
.ِوَ أَمْرٌ لَيْسَ باليَسريُإذا حَ دَثَ ذلِكَ فَه
If that happens, it will be a serious matter.
Clauses containing the conditional particle  إذاcan be switched around. This 
requires the faa’ to be dropped at the beginning of َ سَ وْفor the pronoun in 
equational sentences. Consider the following:
. ُإِذا دَرَسْ تَ كَثرياً فَسَ وْفَ تَنْجَ حIf you study hard, you will pass.
.ً إِذا دَرَسْ تَ كَثرياُسَ وْفَ تَنْجَ حYou will pass if you study hard.

Recall that by placing an element at the front of a sentence, more emphasis is 
put on that element.
20.1.2 ْ“ لَوwere,” “had . . . been”
ْ لَوexpresses conditions that are contrary to fact, or conditions that are not 
realizable. The use of ْ لَوrequires that the result clause begin with  .لَـClauses 
containing the conditional ْ لَوmust always be sentence-initial. Certain conditions 
must apply on the use of ْ ,لَوhowever.
1.
Both conditional and result clauses must have verbs in the past tense, as in 
the following examples:
.َ األَهرامُ، لَشاهَدْتْر مِصُرْتُلَوْ ز
Had I visited Egypt, I would have seen the pyramids.
. َلَوْ دَرَسَ لَنَجَ ح
Had he studied, he would have passed.
The visit to Egypt has not been realized in the first sentence above. There-
fore, the viewing of the pyramids did not happen. Similarly, in the second 
sentence, the person mentioned has not studied. Had he studied, he would 
have passed the examination.
2.
The conditional clause may have a verb negated by ْ َم .لThe main clause 
must also begin with the negative particle  ماlinked to َ لـfollowed by a past 
tense verb, as in the following examples:
. ِ يف البَيْتُنْ مَريضاً لَـام بَقيْتُْ أَكَملَوْ ل
Had I not been sick, I would not have stayed at home.
.بنان لَـام شاهَدوا بَعْلَبَكُسافِروا إِىل لُْ يَملَوْ ل
Had they not traveled to Lebanon, they would not have seen  
Baalbek.
Some changes have been noticed in Modern Standard Arabic in the rules 
introduced above. Some writing exhibits the dropping of َ لـwhen the negative 
particle  ماis used, as in the following:
. َكَ ، ما قابَلكُلَوْ رافَقْت
Had I accompanied you, he would not have received you.

Conditionals
257
. ِ يف البَيْتُنْ مَريضاً، ما بَقيتُْ أَكَملَوْ ل
Had I not been sick, I would not have stayed at home.
. َكُْ تَنْجَ حْ ، طَ رَدّتَملَوْ ل
Had you not passed, I would have dismissed you.
3. ْ لَوcan be followed by َّ ,أَنthus forming a conditional particle by combining 
the elements ْ لَوand َّ أَنas a part of the conditional clause. Recall that َّ أَنmust 
be followed by a sentence beginning with a noun, or a suffix pronoun  
(see Chapter 21 on ’Inna and its sisters). The result clause must begin with 
َ لـfollowed by a complete sentence, as in the following:
.ٍَصَ لوا عَىل عَالماتٍ عالِيَةَح الطُّ الّبَ دَرَسوا جَ يِّداً لَّلَوْ أَن
Had the students studied well, they would have obtained high  
grades.
.صَ لَت بِناَّا وَصَ لَت أَمْسِ الَتَّهلَوْ أَن
Had she arrived yesterday, she would have contacted us.
4. ْ لَوcan be followed by the negative particle  الto form “ لَوْ الhad it not been 
for.” This construct can be followed by a nominative noun to form the 
conditional clause. The result clause must begin with َ لـprefixed to the 
negative particle  ماas in the following examples:
.ُمَتِ البِالدَّا تَقَدَم لُلَوْال الـامل
Had it not been for money, the country would not have progressed.
. ُفَقَتِ األَطْ رافَّا اتَمئيسِ لَّ الرُورُضُلَوْال ح
Had it not been for the presence of the president, the parties would  
not have come to an agreement.
20.1.3 ْ“ إِنif”
It is extremely important not to confuse the conditional particle ْ إنwith the 
particles ْ أَنor َّ إِنbecause of their homographic similarities, especially when 
they are not vocalized.
As a conditional particle, ْ إِنis used for a possible condition or a hypo-
thetical one. Various verb tenses can be used in the result clause, as will be 
illustrated below. The conditional clause may use the past tense, as below, or 
the jussive form of the present tense, as follows in the next paragraph.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
258
1.
The clause containing ْ إِنcan have a past tense verb. In this case, the result 
clause can also have a verb in the past tense, as in the following example:
. مَدينةَ فاسُرْتُ إِىل الـمَغْرِب زُإِنْ سافَرْت
If I travel to Morocco, I will visit the City of Fez.
The use of ْ إِنin the preceding sentence indicates that travel to Morocco is 
likely to happen, which makes it possible to visit Fez.
2.
While the conditional clause containing ْ إِنcan have a past tense verb, the 
result clause can have a future tense verb with  فـattached to the future 
particle:
. فاسُ إِىل الـمَغرِب فَسَ وْفَ أَزورُإِنْ سافَرْت
If I travel to Morocco, I will visit Fez.
Verbs in the main and/or subordinate clauses may be expressed in the past or 
future tenses in Arabic. They are usually expressed in the present and future 
tenses in English.
20.2 Particles with the Jussi e Mood
ْ إِنallows the use of the jussive form of the present tense. The result clause 
must also have a verb in the jussive. The meaning expresses a possible condition, 
as in the following examples:
. ْسْ تَنْجَ حُإِنْ تَدْر
If you (M) study, you will pass.
.شاهِدي أَخيُإِنْ تَذهَبي مَعي ت
If you (F) go with me, you will see my brother.
.سا يَنْجَ حاُإِنْ يَدْر
If they (M, D) study, they will pass.
.شاهِدا صَ ديقيُإِنْ تَذْهَبا إِىل السُّ وقِ ت
If you (M/F, D) go to the suq, you will see my friend.

Conditionals
259
.َلوسٍ أَكْثَرُلوا عَىل فُْصَحإِنْ يَعْمَلوا كَثرياً ي
If they (M, Pl) work a lot, they will get more money.
.اءْرشاهِدْنَ البَتُرْدُّن تُإِنْ تَذهَبْـنَ إِىل األ
If you (F, Pl) go to Jordan, you will see Petra.
.اءْرشاهِدْنَ البَتُرْدُّن يُإِنْ يَذْهَبْـنَ إىل األ
If they (F, Pl) go to Jordan, they will see Petra.
Clauses containing the conditional ْ إِنmust always be sentence-initial. The 
conditional particle ْ إِنcan be dropped from the beginning of the conditional 
clause. In this case, the conditional clause begins with the imperative verb  
form (in the jussive); the result clause must also have a verb in the jussive,  
as in the examples below:
. ْسْ تَنْجَ حُدْرُاStudy and you will succeed.
.ِلْ عَلَيْهُبِ الـاملَ تـَحْ صُطْ لُاSeek wealth and you will get it.
20.2.1 ْ“ مَنwhoever”
ْ مَنhas various functions in the language: as an interrogative particle, introduced 
in Chapter 6, and also as a relative pronoun (see Chapter 22). This section is 
concerned with ْ مَنas a conditional particle, used for human nouns only.
The clause containing “ مَنwhoever” as a conditional particle requires the 
use of the jussive form of the verb. The result clause must also have a verb in 
the jussive, as in the following examples:
.ٍلْ عَىل دَرَجاتٍ عالِيَةُْصَحْتَهِدْ يَجمَنْ يWhoever studies hard gets high marks.
. ْْ يَنَلِرمَنْ يَصْ بWhoever demonstrates patience wins.
20.2.2 “ ماwhatever”
The clause containing the conditional particle “ ماwhatever” requires the use 
of the jussive form of the verb. It is used in reference to non-human nouns. 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
260
The result clause must also have a verb in the jussive, as in the following  
examples:
. َ أَبوكُ يَعْرِفْهُما تَفْعَلْهWhatever you do, your father knows it.
. َّلَبُ يُبوهُما تَطْ لWhatever you (M, Pl) request will be provided.
The following observation should be made regarding the defective verb “ لَبّىto 
provide, to answer” in the second sentence above and similar other verbs. The 
insertion of a fat-Ha at the end of the verb breaks the consonant gemination, 
thus resulting in َّلَبُ.ي
20.2.3 “ مَهْامwhatever”
“ مَهْامwhatever” requires the use of the jussive form. The result clause must 
also have a verb in the jussive, as in the following examples:
.ْنَفِّذُؤْمَرْ يُمَهْام يWhatever he is ordered [to do], he performs.
. َلِ الصِّ دْقُلْ يَقُمَهْام يَقWhatever he says, he says the truth.
20.2.4 “ أَيْنَامwherever”
This particle consists of َ أَيْنplus  .ماThe clause containing “ أَيْنَامwherever” 
requires the use of the verb in the jussive form. The result clause must also 
have a verb in the jussive, as in the following examples:
.ْسافِرُسافِرْ تُأَيْنَام يWherever he travels, she travels.
.َجَ رَِّدِ الشَجأَيْنَام تَذْهَبْ تWherever you go, you find trees.
The insertion of kasra at the end of ِدَج تinstead of the expected sukuun is to 
break the consonant cluster in this example.
20.2.5 “ مَتىwhenever”
“ مَتىwhenever” requires the use of the verb in the jussive form. The result 
clause must also have a verb in the jussive, as in the following examples:

Conditionals
261
. َلوسِ كُلْ عَىل فُِ اإليصالَ تَـحْ صِرـحْ ضُمَتى ت
Whenever you bring the receipt, you get your money.
.َنْفيذَّعْ التَّرْ يَتَوَقُمَتى يَأْم
Whenever he issues an order, he expects execution [of the order].
The required use of the jussive form of the verb with several of the conditional 
particles mentioned above does not apply in two instances:
First, if the result clause is in the negative, the negative particle ْ لَنmust 
be preceded by َ ,فـas in the following:
.ً شَ عْباً كَريامَِّدَ إِالَجسافِرْ إِىل الـمَغْرِب فَلَنْ تُمَهْام ت
lit. “No matter how many times you travel to Morocco,  
you will not find but a generous people.”
Second, if the result clause is in the future tense, as in the following  
example:
.ً شَ عْباً كَريامُِدَجسافِرْ إِىل الـمَغْرِب فَسَ وْفَ تُمَهْام ت
No matter how many times you travel to Morocco, you will  
always find a generous people.
There are other cases where  فـis used at the beginning of the result clause. 
One such case is when the result clause is in the interrogative, as in the  
following example:
؟ُ لَهَُ أَبوكَ فَهَلْ سَ تَقولَرإِذا حَ ض
If your father comes, will you tell him?
The other case is when the particle ْ قَدis used, followed by a present tense verb 
to indicate possibility or likelihood, as in the following example:
.ُُهُِ رخْ بَُ أَبوكَ فَقَدْ أَرإِذا حَ ض
If your father comes, it is possible that I will tell him.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
262
20.2.6 ُّ“ أَيwhoever, whichever”
This element was introduced in Chapter 6 as an interrogative particle in the 
sense of “which” or “who.” It also has a conditional function in the sense  
of “whoever, whichever,” used for both human as well as non-human nouns. 
The clause containing ُّ أَيrequires the use of the jussive verb form. The result 
clause must also have a verb in the jussive, as in the following examples:
. ْسْ يَنْجَ حُأَيُّ إِنْسانٍ يَدْر
Whoever studies will succeed.
! َسافِرْ مَعَكُسافِرْ إِلَيْها أُأَيُّ مَدينَةٍ ت
Whichever city you travel to, I will go with you.
20.2.7 “ كَيْفَامhowever”
This particle consists of َ“ كَيْفhow” and the particle  .ماVerbs in the clause 
containing  كَيْفَامand the main clause must be in the jussive, as in the following 
examples:
. ْطَ عُرْ يُكَيْفَام يَأْمHowever he demands, he is obeyed.
.اَهغْفَرْ لُكَيْفَام تَفْعَلْ يHowever she acts, she is forgiven.
20.2.8 امُ“ حَ يْثwherever”
This particle comprises ُ ,حَ يْثa place adverb in the sense of “where,” in addition 
to  .ماVerbs in both clauses must be in the jussive form, as in the following 
examples:
.ُام يَرْحَ لْ تَرْحَ لْ مَعَهُحَ يْثWherever he relocates, she relocates with him.
. ُباتَّتِ النُـمْطِرْ يَنْبُام تُحَ يْثWherever it rains, plants grow.

The following particles: َّ، لَعَلَّ، لأِ َنَّنِ، لَكَّ، أَنَّنِ، إَّ كَـأَنand َ لَيْتgenerally conjoin 
sentences. َّ إنand َّ لَعَلcan also be used in non-conjoining functions in independ-
ent sentences. Each of these particles has a different meaning. However, all of 
these particles share the following characteristics:
1.
They must be followed by a nominal sentence, that is to say, one that begins 
with a noun or a pronoun (see Chapter 9 on equational sentences). If the 
subject of this sentence is an explicitly expressed noun, its case must  
be in the accusative; the predicate of the equational sentence, however, 
must remain marfuuc, nominative, as in the following examples:
. ِالسّ يّاراتِمٌ بِعَ مُزْدَحِ الشّ ارَّنِيلٌ لكَمالبَيْتُ ج
The house is beautiful, but the street is overcrowded with cars.
.ٌعَةِ الدِّراسَ ةَ مُـمْتَّعَةَ لأِ َنِبُّ اَجلامِأُح
I like the university because studying is interesting.
2.
If the subject of the sentence following these particles is a pronoun, the 
suffixal form of that pronoun must be used, as in the following:
. َهُ يَدْرُسُ هُ ناكَّوت لأِ َنْرىل بَيِسافَرَ صَ ديقي إ
My friend traveled to Beirut because he studies there.
. َا تَعْمَلُ هُ ناكَّهمَشْ ق لأِ َنِىل دِرَجَ عَت إ
She returned to Damascus because she works there.
We now turn to discussing each of these particles separately:
21.1 َّنِ“ لكbut”
This particle contrasts two entities with respect to a particular characteristic. 
Examine the following two examples:
CHAP ER 21
اُه وَأَخَ واتَّ’ إنInna and its sisters

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

.ٌ شارْلوتسڤيل صَ غريَةَّنِشيكاغو كَبريَةٌ لَك
Chicago is large but Charlottesville is small.
.ٌيّارَةَ جَ ديدَةَّ السَّنِالبَـيـْتُ قَديمٌ لَك
The house is old but the car is new.
َّنِ لكcan also contrast the same entity with respect to certain characteristics  
or actions of the same person, as in the following examples:
. ٌهُ بَخيلَّنِيٌّ لَكَِد غَنْمأَح
Ahmad is rich but he is stingy.
.ها ما دَرَسَ تَّنِ لَكِىل الـمَكْ تَبَةِلَيْىل ذَهَبَت إ
Leila went to the library but she did not study.
21.2 َّ“ لأِ َنb
us ”
This particle consists of the prepositions ـِ“ لfor, to” and َّ .أَنIt is used to con-
join two sentences and indicates a reason for connecting them, as in the fol-
lowing examples:
.ٌا قَديمَةَّهيلَةٌ لأِ َنَمحَ لَب ج
Aleppo is beautiful because it is old.
. َبٌ هُ ناكِهُ طالَّىل نيويورك لأِ َنَِد سافَرَ إْمأَح
Ahmad traveled to New York because he is a student there.
. َا تَعْمَلُ هُ ناكَّه لأِ َنِىل الـمَكْ تَبَةِتَذْهَبُ صَ ديقَتي إ
My friend (F) goes to the library because she works there.
Note that the verb following the noun or pronoun after َّألَن may or may not 
agree in tense with the verb in the main clause, as in the following example:
. َا تَعْمَلُ هُ ناكَّه لأِ َنِىل الـمَكْ تَبَةِذَهَبَت صَ ديقَتي إ
My friend (F) went to the library because she works there.
In the preceding sentence, the verb in the main clause is in the past tense, 
whereas the verb in the subordinate clause is in the present. However, in the 

’Inna and its sisters
265
sentence .ا تَعْمَلُ هُ ناكَّه لأِ َنِىل الـمَكْ تَبَةِ تَذْهَبُ صَ ديقَتي إthe verb in the main clause 
is in the present tense, as is the verb in the subordinate clause. The use of tense 
depends on the meaning intended. It is important to note that َّألَن provides 
answers to questions asking for reasons. Consider the two questions below and 
their answers:
؟ِعَةِىل اجلامِبُ إِامذا ما ذَهَبَ الطّ الِلـ
Why did the student not go to the university?
.ًهُ كانَ مَريضاَّ لأِ َنِمعةِىل اجلاِبُ إِما ذَهَبَ الطّ ال
The student did not go to the university because he was sick.
؟ِىل البَيْتِاذا رَجَ عَتْ مَرْيَم إَمل
Why did Mariam return to the house?
.ًا كانَت مَريضَ ةَّه لأِ َنِىل البَيْتِرَجَ عَت مَرْيَم إ
Mariam returned to the house because she was sick.
21.3 َّنِ“ إInd
d” 
nd “t
t”
This particle has two functions in Modern Standard Arabic:
1.
It can begin a sentence to add emphasis to the proposition of the sentence, 
as in the following two sentences:
!َيلٌ اليَوْمَمقْسَ جَّ الطَّنِإIndeed, the weather is beautiful today.
! ٌّمِتابَ مُهِ هذا الكَّنِإIndeed, this book is important.
!َةَّيِا تَدْرُسُ العَرَبَّهإنIndeed, she is studying Arabic.
The sentences are equivalent to:
.َيلٌ اليومَمقْسُ جَّالطThe weather is good today.
. ٌّمِتابُ مُهِهذا الكThis book is important.
.َةَّيِيَ تَدْرُسُ العَرَبِهShe studies Arabic.
The sentences with َّ ,إنhowever, indicate more emphasis on the proposi-
tions in them.

It is also used to change direct into indirect, or reported, speech when the 
preceding verb is َ قالor any of its derived forms. Examine the following:
.«ٌيلَةَمةُ جَّيِبُ : «اللُغَةُ العَرَبِقالَ الطّ ال
The student said: “Arabic is beautiful”.
.ٌيلَةَمةَ جَّيِ اللُغَةَ العَرَبَّبُ إنِقالَ الطّ ال
The student said that Arabic is beautiful.
.ٌةَ سَ هْلَةَّيِ العَرَبَّنِامً يُكَ رِّرُ القَوْلَ إِدائ
He always repeats saying that Arabic is easy.
Note that in the sentence «ٌيلَةَمةُ جَّيِبُ : «اللُغَةُ العَرَبِ قالَ الطّ الthe exact words of the 
student are enclosed between quotation marks. Those words are what is referred 
to as direct speech. In the sentence ٌمجيلَة َ اللغةَ العربيةَّبُ إنِ قالَ الطّ الhowever, the 
exact words by the student are not stated. What the student said is reported 
in indirect speech format. Another example will illustrate this point further:
.«مَشْ قِرُ إىل دِقالَ الـمُ ديرُ: «سَ أُساف
The director said: “I will travel to Damascus.”
.مَشْ قِرُ إىل دِهُ سَ يُسافَّنِقالَ الـمُ ديرُ إ
The director said that he would travel to Damascus.
21.4 َّ“ أَنt
t”
Like َّنِ إabove this particle is also used to change direct into indirect or reported 
speech, as in the following examples:
.«ٌيلَةَمةُ جَّيِذَكَرَ األُسْ تاذُ: «اللُغَةُ العَرَب
The professor said: “Arabic is beautiful”.
.ٌيلَةَمةَ جَّيِ اللُغَةَ العَرَبَّذَكَرَ األُسْ تاذُ أَن
The professor stated that Arabic is beautiful.
Note that in the first sentence the exact words of the teacher are enclosed 
between quotation marks. Those words are what is referred to as direct speech. 
In the second sentence the exact words uttered by the professor are not stated 
and what the professor said is reported in indirect speech.

The professor (F) informed him that she taught at Columbia  
University.
The use of َّ أَنis restricted to verbs of “mention,” “knowing,” “hearing,” etc. 
It is not to be confused with ْ أَنfollowed by the subjunctive (see Chapter 13  
on the subjunctive).
The following list contains some of these verbs and their meanings. A more 
comprehensive list appears in Appendix F.
Verbs that express knowing, understanding, doubting, believing, etc. include:

Verbs expressing confirmation, certainty, etc. include:
ُدَ / يـُؤَكِّدَّأَكto confirm, ascertain, to assure
ُنِْهَربَرْهَنَ / يُبto prove
In addition, there are invariable phrases that require the use of َّ .أَنBelow is  
a partial list:

Note that many of these invariable phrases can function as connectors of state-
ments within or between sentences, as in the following examples:
.ِهِ الـمُ ديرُ يف عَمَلَّسْ تَمَرِهُ كانَ مَريضاً، اَّنْ أَنِ مِغْمَّعَىل الر
Although he was sick, the director continued his work.
.ًامُِ دائَّرقْسَ يَتَغَيَّ الطَّ أَنِحِنَ الواضِم
It is obvious that the weather always changes.
.ًئَةِ كانَت خاطِئيسَّياسَ ةَ الرِ سَّ أَنَّال شَ ك
Undoubtedly, the president’s policy was faulty.
21.5 َّ“ لَعَلP
s”
This particle conveys the meaning of “perhaps”, “maybe”, “it is possible that.” 
It should be strongly emphasized that this particle cannot stand alone, as can 
the English words “perhaps” and “maybe,” in response to a question. As has 
been mentioned previously, َّ لَعَلis not necessarily used to conjoin sentences 
like the other particles in this group; like َّنِ إit can initiate discourse. َّ لَعَلmust 
be followed immediately by a sentential structure that begins with a noun in 
the accusative case or by a suffixal pronoun attached to it, as in the following:
.ًنُ غَداَّقْسَ يَتَحَ سَّ الطَّلَعَل
The weather may improve tomorrow.
. ٌهُ مَريضَّما وَصَ لَ صَ ديقي، لَعَل
My friend did not arrive. Perhaps he is sick.
21.6 َّ“ كَأَنs f, 
s t oug ”
This particle has the meaning of “as if” or “as though.” Like the other members 
in this set, َّ كـَأَنmust be followed by a nominal sentence. If followed by a pro
noun, the suffixal pronoun form must be attached. When followed by a regular 
noun, the noun must be in the accusative. Examine the following:
. َلْجَ ما هَطَ لَّ الثَّ كَأَنِعِيَلْعَبُ األَوْالدُ يف الشّ ار
The kids play in the street as if snow had not fallen.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

. ٌَهُ مَريضَّيَـمْيش كَأَن
He walks as though he were sick.
.ٌلْيونريِهُ مَّجُ لُ كَأَنَّفُ هذا الرَّ َريَـتَـص
This man behaves as if he were a millionaire.
َّ كَأَنdoes not always have to be preceded by a verb as in the preceding examples. 
Its position can be at the beginning of a sentence to express a simile or a  
description of condition or a state, as in the following:
!ٌ اَلعَروسَ قَمَرَّكَأَن
The bride is beautiful (lit. “The bride has the beautiful  
looks of a moon!”)
! ٌ ْر اَلبَيْتَ قَصَّكَأَن
The house has the appearance of a palace!
21.7 َ“ لَيْتf only”
َ لَيْتexpresses a wish that is not realizable. It has the meaning of “if only,” or “if 
it were.” Syntactically, it must be followed by a nominal (equational) sentence, 
with either a suffix pronoun or an accusative noun, as in the following:
.ًيّاِلَيْتَني كُنْتُ غَن
I wish I were rich!
.لَيْتَ احلَرْبَ ما وَقَعَت
If only the war had not happened.
Note that after the particles َّ، لَعَلَّألَن ، َّنِ، لَكَّ، أَنَّ إنand the rest of this group, 
the suffixal pronoun for “ أَناI” is  يor  .ينEither form is acceptable. Examine 
the two pairs of examples below:
.ًن كُنْتُ مَريضاَ ِأ لِعَةِىل اجلامِما ذَهَبْتُ إ
I did not go to the university because I was sick.
.ًني كُنْتُ مَريضاَّ لأِ َنِعَةِما ذَهَبْتُ إىل اجلام
I did not go to the university because I was sick.

. ُني ما أَكَلْتَّنِ لَكِىل البَيْتِرَجَ عْتُ إ
I returned to the house, but I did not eat.
Similarly, if followed by the pronoun ُ“ نَحْ نwe,” the suffixal form  ناor  اis  
acceptable, as in the following:
.َلْنا كَثرياً اليَوْمِ لأِ َنّا عَمِعَبَّالتِنَشْ عُرُ ب
We feel tired because we worked a lot today.

22.1 Singular 
elative Pronoun   
االِسْ م الـمَوْصول الـمُ فْرَد
The relative pronouns (M) ( ,اَلَّذيF) “ اَلَّتيwho / whom, which,” and their dual 
and plural forms, presented below, are used to conjoin two sentences. Hence 
the name  ,االِسْ م الـمَوْصولin which  الـمَوْصولis derived from the verb َ ,وَصَ ل
one of whose meanings is “to connect, to tie together.” In order for these ele-
ments to function grammatically, there must be two sentences, the first of which 
must have a definite noun referred to as the antecedent. This noun can be a 
subject of a sentence or a direct object of a transitive verb, or it can be preceded 
by a preposition. The second sentence must also contain a noun that relates 
or refers to the antecedent. The two sentences are then conjoined to form one 
sentence by using the relative pronoun  اَلَّذيor  اَلَّتيdepending on the gender 
of the antecedent, thus forming two clauses: a main clause and a dependent 
clause. The dependent clause is called a relative clause. In effect, the dependent 
clause becomes a sentential adjective that modifies the definite noun in the 
main clause, i.e. the antecedent.  اَلَّذي، اَلَّتيare invariable in form. Arab gram-
marians call the structure beginning with the relative pronoun .صِ لَة الـمَوْصول
 الذيis used to introduce clauses modifying masculine nouns.  ,اَلَّتيon 
the other hand, is used to introduce feminine nouns in the singular, and is also 
used with non-human plural nouns.
22.1.1  اَلَّذيand  اَلَّتيreplacing subject nouns
 اَلَّذيreplaces masculine singular nouns only.  اَلَّتيreplaces feminine singular 
nouns. Examine the following:
. ُسافَرَ الرَّجُ لThe man departed.
.ِدَرَّسَ الرَّجُ لُ يف اجلامِعَةThe man taught at the university.
CH P
 22
Relative pronouns االِسْ م الـمَوْصول

Relative pronouns
273
The second sentence provides extra information about ُ الرَّجُ لin the first sentence 
(the antecedent). In other words, this sentence functions like an adjective in the 
form of a sentence, rather than a single-word adjective. Since ُ الرَّجُ لin these 
two sentences refers to the same entity, the second occurrence of ُ الرَّجُ لis  
replaced, for style and more idiomatic Arabic, by the relative pronoun  ,اَلَّذي
which must follow the antecedent immediately, thus resulting in:
.ِسافَرَ الرَّجُ لُ اَلَّذي دَرَّسَ يف اجلامِعَة
The man who taught at the university departed.
If the antecedent is a feminine noun,  اَلَّتيmust be used, as in the following 
pair of sentences:
.ُسافَرَتِ الـمَرْأَةThe woman departed.
.ِدَرَّسَ تِ الـمَرْأَةُ يف اجلامِعَةThe woman taught at the university.
Instead of repeating ُ الـمَرْأَةin the second sentence, this noun is replaced by the 
relative pronoun  ,اَلَّتيthus resulting in:
.ِسافَرَتِ الـمَرْأَةُ اَلَّتي دَرَّسَ ت يف اجلامِعَة
The woman who taught at the university departed.
Note that  اَلَّذيor  اَلَّتيcan be followed by a verb. This verb can vary in tense. The 
use of the appropriate tense depends on the meaning intended to be conveyed. 
They can also be followed by a nominal sentence, as in the following:
.ٌشاهَدُّ تُ الطّ الِبَ الذي أَخوهُ وَزير
I saw the student whose brother is a minister.
.ٌشاهَدْنا البِـنْتَ التي أُمُّها مُـمَرِّضَ ة
We saw the girl whose mother is a nurse.
.ِعَرَفْنا الطالِبَةَ التي يُدَرِّسُ أَبوها يف اجلامِعَة
We knew the student whose father teaches at the university.
.قابَلوا الصَّ ديقَ الذي كانَ زائِراً من العِراق
They met the friend who was visiting from Iraq.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
274
22.1.2  اَلَّذيand  اَلَّتيreplacing object nouns
We shall now examine examples in which the noun in the second sentence is 
a direct object of a transitive verb:
. ُسافَرَ الرَّجُ لThe man departed.
.ِشاهَدْتُ الرَّجُ لَ يف اجلامِعَةI saw the man at the university.
In the second sentence above, َ الرَّجُ لis a direct object of the verb ُ .شاهَدُّ تThe 
two sentences can be conjoined by  .اَلَّذيHowever, َ الرَّجُ لin the second sentence 
must be replaced by a suffixal form of the pronoun َ ,هُ وnamely ُ .هThis pronoun 
must attach to the verb, as in the example below:
.ِسافَرَ الرَّجُ لُ اَلَّذي شاهَدتُهُ يف اجلامِعَة
The man whom I saw at the university departed.”
Similarly, a feminine noun is replaced by a suffix form of the pronoun َ هِي
in the example below:
.ُسافَرَتِ الـمَرْأَة
The woman departed.
.ِشاهَدْتُ الـمَرْأَةَ يف اجلامِعَة
I saw the woman at the university.
.ِا يف اجلامِعَةُهسافَرَتِ الـمَرْأَةُ اَلَّتي شاهَدْت
The woman whom I saw at the university departed.
22.1.3  اَلَّذيand  اَلَّتيreplacing nouns governed by prepositions
Some verbs are said to be transitive in Arabic by the use of prepositions in 
order for syntax to be grammatical. Examples of such verbs include  بَحَ ثَ عَن
“to look for,” “ حَ صَ لَ عَىلto get, obtain,” “ رَجَ عَ مِن/ إِىلto return from / to,” 
etc. When  اَلَّذيor  اَلَّتيis used to begin a sentence with such verbs, the suffixal 
form of the pronoun in the second sentence refers to the antecedent, called 
 الضَّ مري العائِدin Arabic. This pronoun must be attached to the preposition, as 
in the following examples:

Relative pronouns
275
. َقَرَأْتُ الكِتابI read the book.
.حَ صَ لْتُ عَىل الكِتابِ يف واشِ نْطُ نI got the book in Washington.
Thus the two sentences can be conjoined by  اَلَّذيas follows:
.قَرَأْتُ الكِتابَ اَلَّذي حَ صَ لْتُ عَلَيْهِ يف واشِ نْطُ ن
I read the book that I obtained in Washington.
The suffixal pronoun -ُ هreplacing the masculine noun ِ الكِتابmust be attached 
to the preposition لَ .عRecall that in the orthography, the ’alif  maqSuura changes 
to a regular yaa’ when a suffix is attached to it. As was mentioned in Chapter 5, 
-ُ هchanges to -ِ هwhen preceded by a kasra or a yaa’. Thus instead of ُ عَلَيْهwe 
obtain ِ.عَلَيْه
In the following two sentences,  اَلَّتيreplaces the feminine noun ُ اَلوَرَقَةin 
the second sentence. The suffixal pronoun replacing this feminine noun is  ,ها
which must be attached to the preposition  .عَنExamine the following:
.ُهذِهِ هِيَ الوَرَقَةThis is the paper.
. ِبَحَ ثْتُ عَنِ الوَرَقَةِ يف البَيْتI looked for the paper in the house.
. ِهذِهِ هِيَ الوَرَقَةُ اَلَّتي بَحَ ثْتُ عَنْها يف البَيْتThis is the paper that I looked for  
in the house.
If in the second sentence the  فاعِلis the same as the antecedent, the use of  
a suffixal pronoun is not called for, as in the following example:
. َقَرَأْتُ الكِتابI read the book.
.ٍيَتَكَ وَّنُ الكِتابُ مِنْ أَرْبَعَةِ فُصولThe book consists of four chapters.
.ِ قَرَأْتُ الكِتابَ اَلَّذي يَتَكَ وَّنُ مِنْ أَرْبَعَة
فُصُ ولٍ
I read the book that consists of  
four chapters.
22.1.4  اَلَّتيreplacing non-human plural nouns
As was stated in Chapter 4, non-human plural nouns are treated as feminine 
singular in Arabic. Therefore  اَلَّتيmust be used to replace non-human plural 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
276
nouns such as ٌ ,سَ يّاراتٌ ، جامِعاتand ٌ .كُتُبIn the following examples  اَلَّتيreplaces 
subject nouns:
. ُرَجَ عَتِ السَّ ياراتThe cars returned.
.سافَرَتِ السَّ يّاراتُ إىل بَغْدادThe cars traveled to Baghdad.
.رَجَ عَتِ السَّ ياراتُ التي سافَرَتْ إِىل بَغْدادThe cars that traveled to Baghdad  
returned.
When  اَلَّتيis used to replace non-human nouns functioning as objects of transitive 
verbs, these nouns are replaced by the suffixal form of the pronoun َ ,هِيi.e., 
 .هاThis suffix pronoun must attach to the verb, as in the following:
. َقَرَأَ صَ ديقي الكُ تُبMy friend (M) read the books.
. َِنْجواي كَتَبَ الكُ تُبَمهHemingway wrote the books.
.ِنْجوايَمقَرَأَ صَ ديقي الكُ تُبَ التي كَتَبَها هMy friend read the books which  
Hemingway wrote.
Likewise, when a noun is preceded by a preposition, the suffix pronoun must 
attach to the preposition, as in the following:
. ِزُرْنا اجلامِعاتWe visited the universities.
. ِأُخْ تي دَرَسَ ت يف اجلامعاتMy sister studied in universities.
.زُرْنا اجلامِعاتِ التي دَرَسَ ت أُخْ تي فيهاWe visited the universities in  
which my sister studied.
22.1.5 Relative pronouns without antecedents
The relative pronouns  اَلَّذيand  اَلَّتيare also used in situations where no  
antecedent is present. This is equivalent to the English structure “he who,” 
“she who,” or “the one who.” Such usage can occur as:
1.
Subjects of sentences, as in the following examples:
.ٍْصُ لُ عَىل جائِزَةَحاَلَّذي يَدْرُسُ كَثرياً ي
He who studies hard will win a prize.

Relative pronouns
277
.ِاَلَّتي وَصَ لَت أَمْسِ تَعْمَلُ يف اجلامِعَة

Objects of verbs, as in the following examples:
. ِقابَلْنا اَلَّذي وَصَ لَ أَمْس
We met the one who arrived yesterday.
.َ ت عَن العِراقَرشاهَدْنا اَلَّتي حاض
We saw the one (F) who lectured about Iraq.
3.
Governed by a preposition, as in the following examples:
َ أَمْسِ ؟َرهَل اِسْ تَمَعْتَ إِىل اَلَّذي حاض
Did you listen to the one who lectured yesterday?
.بَحَ ثْتُ عَن اَلَّتي وَصَ لَت مِن اليَمَن
I looked for the one (F) who arrived from Yemen.
A final note about the verb tenses used in  االِسْ م  الـمَوْصولis in order. The  
preceding examples mostly have past tense verbs. However, the use of other 
tenses is possible. Sentences containing verbs in the present or future tenses 
can be conjoined by  اَلَّذيor  ,اَلَّتيas in the following example:
.األُسْ تاذَةُ اَلَّتي تُدَرِّسُ يف اجلامِعَةِ سَ وْفَ تُسافِرُ إِىل القاهِرَة
The professor (F) who teaches at the university will travel to Cairo.
Note that in the preceding sentence,  اَلَّتيis followed by a verb in the present 
whereas the main clause contains the future tense.

22.2.1 ِ اَللذانand ِ اَللتانreplacing subject nouns
ِ اَللذانis the dual form of  .اَلَّذيIt is used when referring to a dual, masculine 
noun in the nominative case, as in the following example:
. ِوَصَ لَ الصَّ ديقانِ أَمْسThe two friends (M) arrived yesterday.
. َكَتَبَ الصَّ ديقانِ الكِتابThe two friends (M) wrote the book.
ِ الصَّ ديقانin the second sentence is replaced by ِ ,اَللَذانresulting in the following:
. ِوَصَ لَ الصَّ ديقانِ اَللذانِ كَتَبا الكِتابَ أَمْس
The two friends (M) who wrote the book arrived yesterday.
Note that the verb following ِ اَللَذانmust also be in the dual. ِ اللتانreplaces 
feminine, dual and nominative nouns, similarly to the preceding discussion, as 
in the following example:
. ِوَصَ لَتِ الصَّ ديقَتانِ أَمْسThe friends (F, D) arrived yesterday.
. َالصَّ ديقَتانِ كَتَبَتا الكِتابThe friends (F, D) wrote the book.
. ِوَصَ لَتِ أَمْسِ الصَّ ديقَتانِ اَللتانِ كَتَبَتا اَلكِتابThe friends (F, D) who wrote the  
book arrived yesterday.
22.2.2 ِ اَللذَيْنand ِ اَللَتنيreplacing direct object nouns and 
objects of prepositions
ِ اَللذانand ِ اَللتانassume a different form, namely ِ اَللذَيْنand ِ ,اَللَتَـيْـنwhen they 
are in the accusative or genitive cases. Thus, when their antecedents are in the 
accusative (or genitive), as we shall see below, ِ اَللذَيْنand ِ اَللَتنيmust be used, 
as in the following two sets of examples:
.ِداوَى الطَّ بيبُ الـمَريضَ يـْن
The doctor treated the two patients (M).
.ِشاهَدْنا الـمَـريضَ يـْنِ يف العِيادَة

.ِا يف العِيادَةُمداوَى الطَّ بيبُ الـمَـريضَ يـْنِ اَللذَيْنِ شاهَدناه
The doctor treated the two patients (M) whom we saw in the clinic.
Note that in the sentences above, the antecedent ِ“ الـمَريضَ يـْنthe two patients 
(M),” is in the accusative case because it is a direct object of the verb  داوَى
“to treat.” Consequently, ِ الـمَريضَ يـْنin the second sentence is replaced by the 
relative pronoun ِ .اَللذَيْنThe dual noun in the second sentence is replaced  
by the suffixal dual pronoun اُم .هThis suffixal form must obligatorily attach  
to the verb .شاهَدْنا
داوى الطَّ بيبُ الـمَريضَ تـَيـْنِ.
The doctor treated the two patients (F).
.ِشاهَدْنا الـمَـريضَ تَيـْنِ يف العِيادَة
We saw the two patients (F) in the clinic.
.ِا يف العِيادَةُمداوى الطَّ بيبُ الـمَريضَ تَـيـْنِ اَللَتنيِ شاهَدْناه
The doctor treated the two patients (F) whom we saw in the clinic.
On the other hand, ِ الـمَريضَ تَـيـْنin the second sentence above is replaced  
by ِ .اللتَـيـْنThe dual noun in the second sentence is replaced by the suffixal 
dual pronoun اُم .هThis suffixal form must obligatorily attach to the verb 
.شاهَدْ نا
With verbs requiring the use of prepositions such as “ حَ صَ لَ عَىلto obtain, 
acquire,” the suffixal form of the pronoun replacing the noun in the second 
sentence must attach to the preposition, as in the following examples:
.ِ ْنقَرَأْتُ الكِتابَي
I read the two books.

Note that َ“ املُعَلِّمنيthe teachers” in the second sentence is a direct object of 
َ .قابَلIt is replaced by the plural pronoun ْ ,هُ مwhich must attach to the verb.
In conjoining two sentences, the plural masculine noun governed by  
a preposition in the second sentence must be replaced by a suffix form of  
the pronoun. This suffix pronoun must attach to the preposition, as in the  
following:
.َشاهَدْنا الـمُ عَلِّمني

it modifies, as in the following:
.َِ ت أَمْسِ النِّساءُ اللوايت يَعْمَلْنَ يف اجلامِعَةَرحَ ض
The women who work at the university came yesterday.
The preceding sentence conveys nuance in meaning by emphasizing time due 
to the fronting of the adverb ِ أَمْسcloser to the verb.

It has been mentioned that the relative pronouns  اَلَّذي، اَلَّتيand their dual 
and plural variants are used to conjoin two sentences in which the second 
sentence contains a noun related to the noun in the first. It has also been 
emphasized that these relative pronouns are only used when the antecedent 
in the first sentence is definite. In cases when the antecedent is indefinite,  
the relative pronouns are not used. Instead, a verbal sentence must be used 
to modify the antecedent, essentially functioning as a sentential adjective, 
hence the Arabic name ْلَة الصِّ فَةُم جfor such structures. The tense of verbs in 
such sentences may vary depending on the time the interlocutor intends to 
convey: past, present or future tense. Verbs in لة الصِّ فَةُم جmust agree with the 
indefinite antecedent in number and gender, however. Recall that non-human 
plural nouns are always treated as feminine singular and the verb used  
in ْلة  الصِّ فَةُم جfollowing such nouns must be in the singular. Examine the  
following examples:
.وَصَ لَ طالِبٌ زارَ القاهِرَة
A student (M, Sg) who visited Cairo arrived.
.ِِكَةَّرغادَرَتِ البِالدَ مُوَظَّ فَةٌ تَعْمَلُ يف الش

If the noun modified is a subject of a verb, the subject pronoun is expressed 
in the verb of لة الصِّ فةُم ,جas in the following:
.َزارَتْنا طالِبةٌ دَرَست العَربيَّة
A student who studied Arabic visited us.

On the other hand, if the noun modified is an object of a verb or object of  
a preposition, a suffixal pronoun, i.e.  ,الضَّ مري  العائِدmust be attached to the  
verb of لة الصِّ فةُم ,جas in the following examples:
.أَكَلوا أَكْالً طَ بَخَ هُ سامي

22.5.1 ْ مَنand  ماas relative pronouns
If the antecedent is not explicitly mentioned, the relative pronouns cannot be 
used. Instead of  اَلَّذيand  اَلَّتيthere are two other elements that function as 
relative pronouns: ْ“ مَنwho” (for human nouns, masculine or feminine) and 
“ ماwhat” (for non-human nouns):
22.5.1.1 ْمَن
Examine the following examples:
. ِوَصَ لَ أَمْسHe arrived yesterday.
.َكَتَبَ الكِتابَ اجلَديدHe wrote the new book.
.َوَصَ لَ مَنْ كَتَبَ الكِتابَ اجلَديدThe one who wrote the new book arrived.
Note that ِ وَصَ لَ أَمسamounts to a complete sentence by itself in which there is 
no mention of the person who arrived, presumably a masculine entity, i.e. َ هُ و
“he.” On the other hand, َ“ كَتَبَ الكِتابَ اجلديدHe wrote the new book,” is also 
a sentence, the subject of which, while not explicitly expressed, is deduced to be 
human, i.e. the pronoun َ .هُ وIn both sentences, the referent is the same. In other 
words, the subject of both sentences refers to the same human entity. Thus, 
these two sentences are conjoined by  ,مَنas in َ .وَصَ لَ  مَنْ  كَتَبَ  الكِتابَ  اجلديد
We should mention that the above sentence is equivalent to the following, 
which contains the relative pronoun  الذيdiscussed earlier:
.َوَصَ لَ الذي كَتَبَ الكِتابَ اجلَديد
He who wrote the new book arrived.
Note that if the antecedent is known and explicitly expressed, the relative 
pronoun  اَلَّذيmust be used, as in the following:
.َوَصَ لَ الكاتِبُ الذي كَتَبَ الكِتابَ اجلَديد
The writer who wrote the new book arrived.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
286
22.5.1.2 ما
If, on the other hand, the subject of the second sentence is non-human,  ماis 
used, as in the following:
. ُنَعْرِفWe know.
. ِحَ دَثَ أَمْسIt happened yesterday.
. ِنَعْرِفُ ما حَ دَثَ أَمْسWe know what happened yesterday.
The preceding sentence is equivalent in meaning to the following:
. ِنَعْرِفُ الذي حَ دَثَ أمْسWe know what happened yesterday.
Note that if the antecedent is stated, the referent and the relative pronoun  اَلَّذي
must appear, as in:
. ِنَعْرِفُ الشَّ يئَ الذي حَ دَثَ أَمْسWe know the thing that happened yesterday.
If the second sentence contains a transitive verb such as َ“ طَ بَخto cook” and 
َ“ قابَلto meet,” for example, the verb in the second sentence must have a suf-
fixal form of a pronoun attached to it, expressing the direct object of the verb. 
Examine the following examples:
.أُحِ بُّ ما طَ بَخَ هُ صَ ديقيI like what my friend cooked.
.َ مَنْ قابَلْتُهُ يف القاهِرَةَرحَ ضThe one I met in Cairo arrived.
In  أُحِ بُّ ما طَ بَخَ هُ صَ ديقيwe observe that  ماis in a direct object position. In this 
situation, the verb following  ,ماnamely َ“ طَ بَخto cook,” must have a suffixal 
form of the pronoun َ هُ وattached to it. It is also possible to delete the pronoun, 
so the preceding sentence would be equivalent to the following:
.أُحِ بَّ ما طَ بَخَ صَ ديقيI like what my friend cooked.
Similarly, in the sentence َ  مَنْ  قابَلْتُهُ  يف  القاهِرَةَر“ حَ ضThe one I met in Cairo  
arrived,” the verb َ قابَلhas the suffixal form of َ ,هُ وnamely ُه- as a direct object 
to this verb.

Relative pronouns
287
If the verb requires a preposition when the antecedent is not explicitly stated, 
the suffix pronoun must attach to this preposition, as in the following:
.ُقَرَأْنا ما حَ صَ لَ عَلَيْهِ األَُسْ تاذWe read what the teacher obtained.
.ُشاهَدْنا مَنْ بَحَ ثْنا عَنْهWe saw who we looked for.

 اِسْ مُ الفاعِلagentive nouns, often referred to as active participles, are derived 
from verbs to denote the performer of the action as expressed in the verb. In 
the same way that the English word “teacher” indicates “the person who teaches,” 
the Arabic ٌ“ كاتِبwriter,” derived from the verb َ“ كَتَبto write,” signifies “the 
person who performs the act of writing.” Hence the name  اِسْ م الفاعِلin Arabic, 
“noun representing the performer.” These derivations function primarily as 
regular nouns in the language. Secondarily, they can function as adjectives. The 
derivation of  اسم الفاعِلand its functions are shown below.
23.1 Form I Verbs َفَعَل
 اِسْ م الفاعِلare derived from َ فَعَلverbs (Form I) according to the ٌ( فاعِلfaacilun) 
pattern. Thus, from َ دَرَسwe obtain ٌ“ دارِسhe who studies, i.e., a student,  
or a researcher (M).” The feminine form of this agentive noun is ٌ“ دارِسَ ةa re­
searcher, a student (F).” From the verb َِ بَر“ شto drink,” we obtain ٌ ,شارِب
“he who drinks, a drinker (M),” and its feminine counterpart ٌ“ شارِبَةa drinker 
(F).” The plural of such nouns will be discussed in Chapter 28.
23.1.1 Hollow verbs اِسْ م فاعِل
To derive  اسم فاعِلfrom verbs like َ“ زارto visit,” or َ“ نامto sleep,” the  فاعِل
pattern is used with a minor variation. The expected middle consonant in the 
case of hollow verbs is always a hamza, written on a yaa’ seat minus the two 
dots of the yaa’. Accordingly, from َ“ زارto visit,” we obtain ٌ“ زائِرa visitor”; 
from َ“ نامto sleep,” we obtain ٌ“ نائِمhe who sleeps, a sleeper.”
The following examples illustrate agentive nouns functioning as a performer 
of action, an object of a transitive verb, and, finally, when preceded by a preposition.

.ِذَهَبَ إِىل الـمَطْ عَمِ مَعَ اجلائِعَةHe went to the restaurant with  
the hungry one (F).
23.1.2 Defective verbs اِسم فاعِل
The derivation of agentive nouns from defective verbs (a subcategory of َ فَعَل
verbs (Form I)) follows the aforementioned ٌ فاعِلpattern. For example, from 
the verb “ دَعاto invite,” we derive the agentive noun “ داعيinviter (M),” and 
from the verb َىَم“ حto protect,” we derive the agentive noun “ حاميprotector 
(M).” When such nouns are indefinite and masculine, they end with an in 
sound (tanwiin), represented in the orthography by two kasras, and we thus 
obtain ٍ“ داعhe who invites, an inviter (M)”; ٍ“ حامa protector (M).”
However, when such nouns are made definite by the use of the definite 
article  ,الـthe tanwiin changes to a yaa’. For example, ٍ داعand ٍ حامbecome 
“ الدّاعيthe inviter (M),” and “ احلاميthe protector (M),” respectively. Similarly, 
when a suffix pronoun is attached to such nouns, the tanwiin changes to a yaa’ 
as in, for example, ِ“ داعيهhis inviter,” and “ حاميهاher protector.”
The yaa’ is also realized in these masculine nouns when they are put in 
the accusative, or in the IDhaafa construct, as in the following examples:
.ٍقابَلْتُ داعِياً إىل حَ فْلَةI met an inviter (M) to a party.
.ٍقابَلْتُ الدّاعِيَ إىل حَ فْلَةI met the inviter to the party.
.ِقابَلْتُ داعِيَ احلَفْلَةI met the party’s inviter (M).
In addition, the yaa’ is also realized when such nouns are put in the feminine. 
Thus ٍ داعbecomes ٌ“ داعِيَةan inviter (F)” and ٍ حامbecomes ٌ“ حامِيَةa protector 
(F).” The masculine  اِسْ مُ الفاعِلin the preceding sentences is rendered into the 
feminine as follows:
.ٍقابَلْتُ داعِيَةً إىل حَ فْلَةI met an inviter (F) to a party.
.ٍقابَلْتُ الدّاعِيَةَ إىل حَ فْلَةI met the inviter (F) to a party.
.ِقابَلْتُ داعِيَةَ احلَفْلَـةI met the party’s inviter (F).

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

23.1.3 Doubled verbs اِسم فاعِل
Agentive nouns derived from doubled verbs according to the ٌ فاعِلpattern 
maintain the geminate consonants. For example, from the verb َّ“ مَرto pass 
through,” we derive ٌّ“ مارone who passes by/through (M),” and from َّ شَ ك
“to doubt,” we derive ٌّ“ شاكa doubter (M).” The feminine counterparts of  
these nouns are ٌ“ مارَّةone who passes through (F),” and ٌ“ شاكَّةa doubter (F).” 
The following are examples of how such nouns are used:
.ِالـامرُّ أَمامَ البَيْتِ سَ أَلَ عَنِ العُنْوان
The passer by (M) in front of the house inquired about the address.
.َِأَت إِىل الـمَكْ تَبَةَلج ِالشّ اكَّةُ يف هذِهِ الـمَعلومات
The doubter (F) of this information resorted to the library.
Agentive nouns from waaw beginning verbs, yaa’-initial verbs and verbs beginning 
with a hamza follow the same pattern. Thus, from َ“ وَجَ دto find,” we obtain 
ٌ“ واجِ دfinder,” from َ“ يَئِسto despair,” we derive ٌ“ يائِسdespairer,” and from 
َ“ أَكَلto eat,” we obtain ٌ“ آكِلeater.” Note the change of the hamza into a longer 
hamza،, labeled madda  هin Arabic.
23.2 Form II–X 
erbs َ اِسْ تَفْعَل- َفَعَّل
Now we turn to examine how  اسْ م فاعِلis derived from َ( فَعَّلForm II) through 
َ( اسْ تَفْعَلForm X). A general statement can be made about deriving agentive 
nouns from these verb forms.  اِسْ مُ الفاعِلin these verb patterns always begins 
with a miim followed by a Dhamma, namely  .مُـThe penultimate vowel in  
 اسم فاعِلin this group of verbs is always a kasra. Thus, from the verb َ دَرَّس
“to teach,” we obtain ٌ“ مُدَرِّسa teacher (M)”; from َ“ سافَرto travel,” we obtain 
ٌ“ مُسافِرa traveler (M)”; from َ“ أَرْسَ لto send,” we obtain ٌ“ مُرْسِ لa sender (M).” 
And so on with the other verb forms.
The feminine form of agentive nouns in the derived verb forms is made by 
suffixing the taa’ marbuuTa, as in ٌ“ مُدَرِّسَ ةa teacher (F),” ٌ“ مُسافِرَةa traveler (F)”, 
ٌ“ مُرْسِ لَةa sender (F),” etc.
The plural formation of such agentive nouns is regular. (See Chapter 28 
on plural nouns.)

23.2.1 Hollow verbs in َ اِسْ تَفْعَل- َ( فَعَّلForms II–X) اِسْ م فاعِل
Hollow verbs can be augmented to derive the following forms: َ( أَفْعَلForm IV), 
َ( اِنْفَعَلForm VII), َ( اِفْتَعَلForm VIII) and َ( اِسْ تَفْعَلForm X). Note that due to 
the presence of the long ’alif in hollow verbs, the penultimate vowel also pre­
sents some variation: it is either an ’alif as in forms VII and VIII, or a yaa’, as 
in forms IV and X. The following table illustrates the way agentive nouns are

ouns
Agentive nouns can function as regular nouns and as adjectives modifying  
other nouns. As nouns they may be the subjects of sentences, direct objects  
of transitive verbs, or governed by prepositions. They may also be a part of an 
IDhaafa construct. As adjectives, agentive nouns must agree with the noun they 
modify in gender, number, case and determination.
23.3.1 Agentive nouns functioning as nouns
As nouns, agentive nouns could be rendered into English as nouns that end 
with “ er” or “ or”, or “ ant” such as “teacher,” “professor,” or “applicant.”
23.3.1.1 As subjects
Examine the agentive nouns as subjects in the following sentences:
.ِالعامِلُ ذَهَبَ إىل الـمَصْ نَع
The worker went to the factory.
.ًَت كِتاباً جَ ديداَرالكاتِبَةُ الـمَشْ هورَةُ نَش
The famous writer (F) published a new book.
Note that ُ“ العامِلthe worker” in the first sentence and ُ“ الكاتِبَةthe writer (F)” 
in the second sentence are subjects of the sentences.

23.3.1.2 As objects
 اِسْ مُ الفاعِلnouns can also be direct objects of transitive verbs, as in the following 
examples:
. ِقابَلَ أَيب السّ اكِنَ اجلَديدَ أَمْس
My father met the new resident yesterday.
هَلْ عَرَفْتَ اخلارِجَ مِنَ البَيْتِ ؟
Did you know the person who exited from the house?
23.3.1.3 Preceded by prepositions
Additionally,  اِسْ مُ  الفاعِلcan be governed by a preposition. If the noun is  
singular, it must end with a kasra, as in the following:
.ِالكِتابُ مَعَ الطّ الِبَةThe book is with the student (F).
It is worth noting how the agentive noun ُ الطّ الِبwith its feminine counterpart 
ُ الطّ الِبَةhas come to mean “a student.” The verb َ طَ لَبoriginally meant “to seek, 
request.” A “student,” therefore, is the person who seeks, in this case knowledge 
and learning in a school or university setting. In other situations, it simply 
means “a seeker,” as in the following example:
.ِاِسْ تَقْبَلوا طالِبَ العَوْنThey received the help seeker.
23.3.1.4 In an IDhaafa-construct
As a noun,  اِسْ مُ الفاعِلcan also be part of an IDhaafa construct, as in the following:
.سافَرَ مُدَرِّسُ اجلامِعَةِ إىل لُبْنان
The university professor traveled to Lebanon.
.ِتَكَ لَّمْتُ مَعَ مُسْ تَقْبِلِ الزّائِر
I talked with the “welcomer” of the visitor.

23.3.2 Agentive nouns functioning as adjectives
Adjectives cannot stand independently in sentences when they are functioning 
in their primary role as adjectives: they must always be used with nouns as a 
way of adding more information about them. Note that when agentive nouns 
function as adjectives, the English translation tends to be the “ ing” form of 
the verb. Examine the following:
. ِوَصَ لَ األُسْ تاذُ الزّائِرُ أَمْسThe visiting professor arrived yesterday.
. ِشاهَدْتُّ الـمَرْأَةَ الـمُ سافِرَةَ أَمْسI saw the traveling woman yesterday.
In the first sentence,  ,وَصَ لَ األُستاذُ الزّائِرُ أَمسthe word “ الزّائِرvisiting” has the 
form of  .اِسْ م فاعِلSince it follows the noun ُ“ األُستاذthe professor, teacher,” it 
must therefore be an adjective. Note that it agrees with the noun in determina­
tion (definite/indefinite), gender (masculine), case (nominative), and number 
(singular).
Similarly, in the second sentence, ِ ,شاهَدْتُ  املَرْأَةَ  املُسافِرَةَ  أَمْسthe word  
َ الـمُ سافِرَةas  اسم  فاعِلmodifies the noun َ الـمَرْأَةand agrees with this noun  
in determination, case, gender and number.
 اِسْ مُ الفاعِلis primarily used as a noun. Its function as adjective is secondary.
23.3.3 Agentive nouns functioning as transitive verbs
Agentive nouns derived from transitive verbs sometimes maintain the behavior 
of these verbs by causing the nouns that follow them to be in a direct object 
position, and consequently in the accusative case. In the following two sentences, 
the agentive noun in the first sentence functions as the first noun in IDhaafa, 
causing the noun following it to be in the genitive case. In the second, the 
agentive noun functions as a transitive verb, causing the noun that follows it 
to be in the accusative case:
. ِزائِرُ اجلامِعَةِ وَصَ لَ مِنَ العِراق أَمْس
The university visitor arrived from Iraq yesterday.
هَلْ قابَلْتَ الرَّجُ لَ الزّائِرَ صَ ديقَهُ؟
Did you meet the man [who is] visiting his friend?

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
296
More examples of agentive nouns that demonstrate the function of transitive 
verbs are provided below:
.َمود قارِئٌ دَرْسَ هَحمMahmoud is reading his lesson.
.ُهذا الـمُ وَظَّ فُ مُهْمِلٌ واجِ بَهThis employee is ignoring his duties.
. َكانَتِ الزَّوْجَ ةُ أَمسِ طابِخَ ةً األَكْلThe wife was cooking the food  
yesterday.
هَلْ عَرَفْتُم أَنَّهُ دارِسٌ الطِّ بَّ ؟Did you know that he is studying  
medicine?

 ,اِسْ مُ الـمَفْعولthe passive participle, is a derivation of verbs used to convey that 
an action has happened or is happening to someone or something else. For 
example, the English word “written” denotes that something was penned down, 
put on paper; in other words, it has undergone the action of writing. The  
passive participle can function as an adjective or a noun. It also appears in  
a number of idiomatic expressions that are followed by dependent clauses.
24.1 Derivation of passive participles اِسْ مُ الـمَفْعول
24.1.1 َ( فَعَلForm I)
Passive participles from َ فَعَلverb forms are derived according to the ٌ مَفْعول
(maf cuul) pattern. Thus, from the verb َِبَر“ شto drink,” we obtain ٌوبْر“ مَشthat 
which is/was drunk,” i.e., “a drink;” and from the verb َ“ كَتَبto write,” we 
obtain ٌ“ مَكتوبthat which is/was written,” i.e., “a letter.”
24.1.1.1 Hollow verbs
Passive participles can be derived from hollow verbs according to the maf cuul 
pattern. Thus, from ُ“ زارَ / يَزورto visit,” we obtain ٌ“ مَزورthat which is visited.”
From ُ“ سارَ  /  يَسريto walk, traverse,” we obtain ٌ“ مَسريthat which was  
traversed.”
Verbs that have ’alif in their present tense, such as ُافَخ“ خافَ  /  يto be 
afraid,” form their passive participle with a waaw, as in ٌوفَخ مin some cases. 
This pertains to the formation of their maSdar. The maSdar of this verb is ٌ خَ وْف
“fear.” This explains why there is a waaw in وفَخ“ مthat which is feared.”  
On the other hand, ُ“ نالَ / يَنالto obtain, to win,” has its passive participle as 
ٌ مَنالor ٌ .مَنيلThe maSdar of this verb is ٌ“ نَيْلwinning,” which explains why the 
passive participle has a yaa’, not a waaw.
H

Passive participles اِسْ مُ الـمَفْعول

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
298
Such passive participle forms are derivable in theory, according to the rules 
advanced above. However, passive participles such as وفَخ مand/or  مَنيلare 
not commonly used in the language. As a proper noun, however,  مَنالappears 
as a woman’s name.
24.1.1.2 Defective verbs
The maf cuul pattern for defective verbs manifests the waaw or the yaa’ of the 
verb’s present tense. Thus for passive participles we obtain ٌّ“ مَدْعُ وa guest,” from 
“ دَعاto invite,” and ٌّ“ مَرْمِيthrown,” from “ رَمىto throw, cast.” The presence 
of the waaw in ٌّ مَدْعُ وreflects the waaw in  ,يَدْعوwhich is the present tense of 
 .دَعاSimilarly, the presence of the yaa’ in ٌّ مَرْمِيreflects the yaa’ in the present 
tense of .يَرْمي
24.1.1.3 Doubled verbs
Doubled verbs are easy to fit into the maf cuul pattern by separating the doubled 
consonants with a waaw. Thus from َّ“ عَدto count, to consider,” we obtain 
ٌ“ مَعْدودthat which is/was counted.” From َّ“ حَ سto feel, to touch,” we obtain 
ٌْسوسَح“ مtangible, material,” and, finally, from َّ شَ كwe obtain ٌ“ مَشْ كوكdoubted, 
suspected.”
24.1.2 َ اِسْ تَفْعَل- َ( فَعَّلForms II–X)
Passive participles from َ فَعَّلverbs (Form II) through َ اسْ تَفْعَلverbs (Form X) 
are derived by a simple process. This involves the positioning of the prefix 
mu- ُ مـat the beginning of the verb. The penultimate vowel is always a fat-Ha. 
In verbs beginning with a hamza, the hamza is dropped. Examine the following:

24.1.2.1 Augmented hollow verbs passive participles
Hollow verbs can be augmented to derive the following forms: َ( أَفْعَلForm IV), 
َ( اِنْفَعَلForm VII), َ( اِفْتَعَلForm VIII) and َ( اِسْ تَفْعَلForm X). Passive participle 
forms can be derived from verbs in these forms by prefixing mu  مُـwhile main-
taining the penultimate ’alif.

24.1.2.2 Augmented defective verbs passive participles
Derivations of passive participles of  ,األَفعال الـمُ ضَ عَّفَة اآلخِ رaugmented defec-
tive verbs of َ( فَعَّلForm II) through َ( اسْ تَفْعَلForm X), follow the same rules of 
derivation mentioned above. The passive participle form begins with ُ مـmu-. 
Due to the absence of a consonant at the end of the verb, however, the passive 
participle ends up with tanwiin, or two fat-Has, in the orthography. For example, 
from “ سَ مّى / يُـسَ مّيto name,” we obtain ً“ مُسَ مّىthat which is named”; from 
“ نادى / يُناديto call,” we obtain ً“ مُنادىhe who is called”; from يَرى / يَشْ تَر اِشْ ت
“to buy,” we obtain ًَىَر“ مُشْ تthat which is bought”; from “ اِسْ تَـثْـنى / يَستَـثْـنيto 
exclude, to except,” we obtain ً“ مُسْ تَثْنىthat which is excluded.”
When the definite article  الـis prefixed to such derivations, the tanwiin is 
dropped. In this case, such words are pronounced with an ’alif sound at their 
end. Thus, ً مُسَ مّىbecomes  الـمُ سَ مّىand ً مُنادىbecomes  الـمُ نادىand so on.
Additionally, the tanwiin is dropped when such derivations are put in  
the feminine. In the orthography, the ’alif  maqSuura in this case changes to  
a regular ’alif. For example, the feminine of ً مُسَ مّىis ٌةّا مُسَ مand the feminine of 
ً مُسْ تَثْنىis ٌ مُسْ تَثْناةand so on. The following sentences illustrate the use of the 
above passive participles:

.َِ تِ األُسْ تاذَةُ الـمُ سْ تَثْناةُ مِنَ الوَظيفَةَرحَ ض

24.1.2.3 Augmented doubled verbs passive participles
The passive participles of “ األَفعالُ الـمُ ضَ عَّفَة اآلخِ رthe doubled verbs” of forms 
II through X are derived by placing the prefix ُ مـmu- at the beginning of the 
verb. Here, the penultimate vowel is always a fat-Ha. Thus from ُّْتَلَح احْ تَلَّ /  ي
“to occupy,” we obtain ٌّْتَلُح“ مoccupied”; from ُّ“ اِمْتَدَّ / يَمْتَدto extend,” we derive 
ٌّْتَدُم“ مextended.” Examine the following sentence:
.ِناقَشَ الرَّئيسُ مُشْ كِلَةَ األَرْضِ الـمُ حْ تَلَّة
The president debated the issue of the occupied territory.
.ْتَدَّةٌ مِنْ كَندا إىل املَكْ سيكُمحُ دودُ أمريكا م
The boundaries of the USA are extended from Canada to Mexico.
24.2 unctions of assive articiples
24.2.1 Passive participles as adjectives
Passive participles are used primarily as adjectives, as illustrated in the examples 
below:
.ِقَرَأْتُ الكِتابَ الـمَكـْتوبَ باللُّغَةِ اإلِنْكِليزِيَّة
I read the book [which is] written in English.
.ِقابَلَتِ األُسْ تاذَةَ الـمَعْروفَةَ يف اجلامِعَة
She met the professor (F) [who is] known at the university.
Note that “ الـمَكْ توبthat which is written,” in the sentence َ قَرَأَْتُ الكِتابَ الـمَكتوب
 ,باللُغَةِ  اإلنْكِليزِيَّةِis derived from the verb َ“ كَتَبto write.” Also, note that its 
position after the noun indicates its function as an adjective modifying the noun 
َ“ الكِتابthe book.” Additionally, note the agreement between َ الكِتابand 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
302
َ الـمَكْ توبin determination (definite/indefinite), gender (masculine), number 
(singular), and, finally, case (accusative), because of the fact that َ الكِتابis  
a direct object of the verb ُ.قَرَأْت
In the sentence ِ قابَلتِ  األُستاذَةَ  الـمَعْروفَةَ  يف  اجلامِعَةthe passive participle 
َ الـمَعْروفةis derived from the verb َ عَرَفaccording to the ( مَفْعولmaf cuul ) 
pattern. In this sentence,  الـمَعْروفَةis used to modify َ .األُسْ تاذَةFurthermore, it 
agrees with this noun in gender, case determination, and number.
The following are more examples of passive participles that illustrate their 
functions as adjectives:
.ِوَصَ لَ اليَوْمَ الرَّجُ لُ الـمَدْعُ وُّ إِىل احلَفْلَة
The man [who was] invited to the party arrived today.
.ِأُحِ بُّ البِناءَ الـمَـبْنِيَّ مِنَ احلَجَ ر
I like the building [which is] built of stone.
.ِسَ لَّمْتُ عَىل األُسْ تاذَةِ الـمَدْعُ وَّةِ إِىل العَشاء
I greeted the teacher (F) [who is] invited to dinner.
24.2.2 Passive participles as nouns
Some passive participles have attained the status of nouns. For example, ٌ مَكْ توب
is used to mean “a letter, an epistle”; ٌوبْر مَشis used to mean “a drink”; ٌ مُسْ تَخْ دَم
and ٌ مُوَظَّ فare both used to mean “employee.” It should be emphasized  
that not all passive participle derivations can be used as nouns. The following 
examples illustrate passive participles that do function as nouns:
. ِقابَلَتِ الـمُ وظَّ فَ يف مَكْ تَبِهِ أَمْس
She met the employee in his office yesterday.
. ِوَصَ لَ الـمَكْ توبُ أَمْس

24.3 assive participle p rases
There are common phrases in Arabic that include a small set of passive parti-
ciples. Such phrases have become idiomatic expressions in the language and 
are invariable in form. They are followed by dependent clauses.
24.3.1 Passive participle phrases used with َّأَن
Passive participle phrases can be used with ’anna َّ أَنto express statements of 
fact. Recall that ’anna َّ أَنmust be followed by a nominal sentence beginning 
with a noun in the accusative case, or a suffix pronoun (see Chapter 21.)

A maSdar or “verbal noun,” as the English translation indicates, is a noun that 
names the activity of a verb. MaSdars are roughly equivalent to gerunds in 
English grammar. These are nouns that end with “-ing” such as “swimming,” 
“eating,” or nouns that end with other morphological elements, derived from 
verbs such as “arrival,” from the verb “to arrive,” or “application,” from the 
verb “to apply.” A single verb may have two or more maSdars in Arabic, some-
times with nuanced differences in meaning.
The maSdar in Arabic behaves as a regular noun but also retains some 
properties of its original verb. As a noun, it can take the definite article, be 
singular, dual or plural, be masculine or feminine, and function in sentences 
like any noun by taking cases according to its role in the sentence.
We present below, as an example, the maSdar ٌ“ زِيارَةa visit” (from the verb 
َ“ زارto visit”), to illustrate its various functions:
1.
The subject of equational sentences:
.ًالزِّيارَةُ كانَت قَصريَة
The visit was short.
In addition to the use of the definite article “ الـthe,” nouns can be made 
definite by the use of suffixal pronouns (possessive), or by the use of ID-
haafa, as in the following examples:
.ًْتِعَةُما كانَت مُهزِيارَت
Her visit was enjoyable.
.زيارَةُ مِص أَعْجَ بَت أَيب
The visit to Egypt pleased my father. (lit. “The Egypt visit”)

25.1.1.1 Hollow verb maSdars
It is also difficult to generalize about the derivation of maSdars from hollow 
verbs. For example, learners should memorize that the maSdar of َ“ زارto visit” 
is ٌ“ زِيارَةvisit, visiting,” the maSdar of َ“ نامto sleep” is ٌ“ نَوْمsleep,” and so on.

25.1.1.2 Doubled verb maSdars
Doubled verbs such as َّ“ مَرto pass, go through” do not follow a set pattern for 
the derivation of verbal nouns. Here is a list of common doubled verbs and 
their maSdars:
Verb
MaSdar
Meaning
َّحَ س
حَ سٌّ / حِ سٌّfeeling
َّحَ ل
حَ لٌّsolving
َّشَ ك
شَ كٌّdoubting
َّعَد
عَدٌّcounting
َّفَر
فَرٌّ / فَرارٌescaping
َّمَر
مُرورٌ / مَرٌّpassing
Some of the doubled verbs have two maSdars, with little, if any, difference  
in meaning. For example, ِ“ حَ سَّ  بـto feel,” has the maSdars ٌّ حَ سand ٌّ حِ س
“feeling,” which have practically the same meaning. As can be seen from this 
example, the maSdars of these doubled verbs resemble their past tense form, 
with tanwiin terminating the verb. Thus we get َّ“ فَرto escape, to flee” and its 
maSdar ٌّ فَرand the more commonly used ٌ“ فَرارthe act of escaping;” from َّ مَر
“to pass,” we obtain ٌّ مَرand the more common ٌ“ مُرورpassing through, transit, 
traffic.”
25.1.1.3 Defective verb maSdars
Defective verbs  األَفعال  الـمُ عْتَلَّة  اآلخِ رcan be divided into two groups with  
respect to the derivation of their verbal nouns. The first group consists of verbs 
that end with a yaa’ in the present tense verb form for the pronoun َ هُ وas in 
“ رَمَى / يَرْميto throw.” Examine the following list of verbs and their maSdars 
below:

The second group includes verbs that end with a waaw in the present tense for 
the pronoun َ ,هُ وas in “ رَجا / يَرْجوto request.” Examine the following list of 
verbs and their maSdars below:

سَ ام
سُ مُ وٌّtranscending
Some defective verbs do not fit the above patterns. For example, from the  
verb  رَأَى / يَرىwe obtain two maSdars with different meanings: ٌ“ رُؤْيَةvisibility” 
or “outlook” and ٌ“ رَأْيopinion.” From the verb “ لَقِيَ / يَلْقىto find, encounter,” 
we obtain ٌ لِقاءٌ، لُقْيَةand  ,لُقْياall meaning “a meeting, an encounter.” Of these 
three maSdars, ٌ لِقاءis more common in usage.
There are other verbs whose verbal nouns do not fit any of the above pat-
terns; they are learned individually and incrementally.
25.1.2 َ فَعَّل- َ( اِسْ تَفْعَلForms II–X) maSdars
Beginning with َ فَعَّلthrough َ اسْ تَفْعَلverbs (Form II through Form X), the  
formation of verbal nouns is regulated by set, and largely predictable, rules. It 

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
312
is quite possible for two verbal nouns derived from the same verb to exist, 
however, one generated from the set rule and another not generated from the 
rule, with more currency in actual usage. Such preferences will be indicated in 
the separate verb patterns.
25.1.2.1 َ( فَعَّلForm II) maSdars
MaSdars from َ فَعَّلverbs are derived according to the pattern ٌ .تَفعيلBelow we 
mention a few illustrative verbs and their maSdars:
َفَعَّل
تَـفْعيلٌMeaning
َدَرَّس
تَـدْريسٌteaching
َحَ سَّ ن
تـَحْ سنيٌimproving
َصَ وَّر
تـَصْ ويرٌdepicting
While it is possible to derive ٌْديثَح تas a verbal noun from َ“ حَ دَّثto tell, to 
inform,” the maSdar ٌ“ حَ ديثtalk, discussion,” is more commonly used. In 
theory, one can obtain ٌْديثَح تaccording to the verbal noun pattern for this verb 
category; however, in practice this form is rarely used in the sense of “talk, 
discussion.” ٌَديثَح تhas a separate meaning altogether. It relates to a secondary 
meaning of َ حَ دَّثwhich is “renew, renovate.” Hence ٌْديثَح تas maSdar has the 
meaning of “renovating, modernizing.”
MaSdars from defective َ فَعَّلverbs (Form II) ending with ’alif  maqSuura are 
derived according to the ٌ تَفْعِلَةtaficlatun pattern, as in the following examples:
َفَعَّل
تَـفعيلٌMeaning
سَ مَّى
تـَسْ مِيَةٌnaming

25.1.2.2 َ( فاعَلForm III) maSdars
There are two verbal nouns from َ فاعَلverbs: ٌ مُفاعَلَةand ٌ .فِعالThe use of ٌ مُفاعَلة
is more prevalent. A few verbs use another form of maSdar entirely.
Knowing which َ( فاعَلForm III) maSdar to use requires study. For example, 
from َ“ قاتَلto fight,” we obtain ٌ مُقاتَلَةand ٌ ,قِتالwhich mean “fighting” in both 
instances but ٌ قِتالis more commonly used. In addition, ٌ قِتالcollocates with the 
word ٌ“ ساحَ ةdomain, area,” as in the term “ ساحة قِتالbattlefield.” Similarly, 
from َ“ كافَحto struggle, to oppose, to fight,” we obtain the two maSdars  مُكافَحَ ة
and  كِفاحwith the same meaning. Yet “ مُكافَحَ ة املُخَ دِّراتfighting [against] drugs” 
and “ مُكافَحَ ة اإلرْهابfighting terrorism” are appropriate collocations, whereas 
 كِفاح املُخَ دِّراتand  كِفاح اإلرْهابare not.

“to travel,” and ٌارَبَةُح“ مfighting” from َ .حارَبThese words exist in older writ-
ings in specialized contexts. However, in Modern Standard Arabic the nouns

Such verbal nouns lose their tanwiin (nunation) and end with a yaa’ when they 
are definite, either by the attachment of the definite article  ,الـthrough the 
formation of an IDhaafa-construct or when a suffix pronoun is attached to 
them, as in the following examples, respectively: “ التَّبَنّيthe adoption,”  تَبَـنّي

اِنـْفِعالٌMeaning
َاِنـْسَ حَ ب

َاِنْقاد
اِنْقيادٌobeying, following
25.1.2.7 َ( اِفْتَعَلForm VIII) maSdars
Verbal nouns from َ اِفْتَعَلverbs are derived according to the ٌ اِفْتِعالpattern, as 
illustrated in the table below:
َاِفْتَعَل
اِفْتـِعالٌMeaning
َاِسْ تـَمَع
اِسْ تـِامعٌlistening
َاِحْ تـَفَل
اِحْ تـِفالٌcelebrating
َاِجْ تَمَع
اِجْ تِامعٌmeeting
Assimilation in this verb category also takes place when the inserted taa’ in 
َ اِفْتَعَلis contiguous with a voiced consonant such as zayn. The verb َ“ زادto 
become more, to increase” in the َ اِفْتَعَلpattern results in َ .اِزْتادThe taa’ changes 
to a daal, as in َ“ اِزْدادs.th. increased,” as a result of its adjacency to the two 
voiced sounds: the preceding zayn, on the one hand, and the following ’alif on 
the other. The verbal noun, therefore, is “ اِزْدِيادincrease, increment.”
From the verb َ“ صَ دَمto hit, collide,” we obtain َ ,اِصْ تَدَمaccording to the َ اِفْتَعَل
pattern. The maSdar is “ اِصْ طِدامcollision.” Through assimilation, the taa’ in 
the verb changes to its emphatic counterpart Taa’ because of the following daal.
25.1.2.7.1 Hollow verb َ( اِفْتَعَلForm VIII) maSdars
MaSdars of hollow verbs in this form have a yaa’ after the first radical, as in 
the following:

examples:
َّاِحْ تـَل
اِحْ تـِاللٌoccupying
َّاِرْتَد
اِرْتِدادٌregressing
َّاِعْتَد
اِعْتِدادٌshowing pride
25.1.2.7.3 Waaw-beginning verb َ( اِفْتَعَلForm VIII) maSdars
In tri-consonantal verbs beginning with a waaw, such as َ“ وَصَ لto arrive,” the 
waaw changes to a taa’ through the process of assimilation. Thus, instead of 
َ ,اِوْتَصَ لa form that does not exist in the vocabulary, we obtain َ“ اِتَّصَ لto contact, 
communicate with.” Therefore, the verbal noun becomes ُ“ اِتِّصالcommunica-
tion, contact.” Similarly, instead of ََدَح( اِوْتaugmented from the root َ وَحَ د
according to the َ اِفْتَعَلpattern), we obtain ََدَّح“ اِتto unite with.” Its maSdar is ٌادِّح اِت
“union, unification,” and so on.
25.1.2.8 َّ( اِفْعَلForm IX) maSdars
The ٌ اِفْعِاللpattern is used to derive verbal nouns from this category, as in the

The derivation of maSdars from “ األَفعال  الرُّباعِيَّةquadriliteral verbs” (four- 
consonant verbs), such as َ“ تَرْجَ مto translate,” َ“ سَ يْطَ رto control,” َ“ هَنْدَسto

A common form of  األفعال الرُّباعيةare the duplicative verbs. These are verbs 
in which the initial syllable is duplicated to form quadriliteral verbs such as 
َ“ وَسْ وَسto instill evil,” َ“ زَلْزَلto shake,” َ“ خَ شْ خَ شto rustle, to rattle,” َ“ بَلْبَلto 
confound, confuse,” َ“ عَشْ عَشto nest,” َ“ قَلْقَلto disturb.”

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR

The quadriliteral pattern َ فَعْلَلis also used in Modern Standard Arabic to coin 
verbs from borrowed nouns such as names of countries, or of imported mod-
ern equipment, as illustrated in the table below:
Noun
Quad. verb
Meaning
تَلِفون
تَلْفَنَto telephone
تَلفِزيون
تَلْفَزَto televise
أَمْريكا
أَمْرَكَto Americanize
السَّ عودِيَّة
سَ عْوَدَto Saudize
MaSdars from the preceding quadriliteral verbs are derived according to the 
 فَعْلَلَةpattern. Thus, we obtain ٌ“ تَلْفَنَةtelephoning,” ٌ“ تَلْفَزَةtelevising,” ٌ أَمْرَكَة
“Americanizing, Americanization,” and ٌ“ سَ عْوَدَةSaudizing.”
25.1.4 Color word maSdars
Some of the basic color words have two maSdars, derived according to the 
patterns  اِفْعِاللand ٌ .فُعْلَةThis applies to three colors, namely, َرْم“ أَحred,”  أَصْ فَر
“yellow,” and “ أَخْ ضgreen.” Thus we obtain ٌِرارْم اِحand ٌْرَةُم ,حboth meaning 
“redness;” ٌ اِصْ فِرارand ٌ“ صُ فْرَةyellowness;” and ٌارِر اِخْ ضand ٌَ ةْر“ خُ ضgreenness, 
verdancy.” There is no difference in meaning between these maSdars. From 
“ أَسْ وَدblack,” we obtain ٌ اِسْ وِدادand ٌ ,سَ وادboth meaning “blackness;” but from ُ أَبْيَض
“white,” we obtain only ٌ“ بَياضwhiteness;” from ُ“ أَزْرَقblue,” we obtain only 
ٌ“ زُرْقَةblueness;” and, finally, from ُ“ أَشْ قَرblond,” we only have ٌ“ شَ قارblondness.”
25.1.5 Miim-beginning maSdars الـمَصْ دَر الـميمي
The maSdar miimi, as the name indicates, is a verbal noun that always has a 
miim at its beginning. The maSdar miimi is always singular and masculine. It is 
derived from regular tri-consonantal verbs only, according to the pattern ٌ مَفْعَل
maf cal(un). Thus, from the verb َ“ طَ لَبto request,” we derive ٌ“ مَطْ لَبa request.” 
This maSdar has the same meaning as the regularly derived maSdar ٌ“ طَ لَبa 
request.” And from the verb َ“ أَكَلto eat,” the maSdar miimi ٌ“ مَأْكَلeating” can 
be derived, which has the same meaning as the regular maSdar ٌ.أَكْل

Verbal nouns: maSdars
323
25.1.5.1 Miim-beginning ma dars from waaw-beginning 
verbs
The maSdar miimi from tri-consonantal verbs beginning with waaw is derived 
according to the pattern ٌ( مَفْعِلmaf cil(un)). Thus, from the verb َ“ وَصَ لto arrive,” 
we can derive ٌ ,مَوْصِ لwhich has the same meaning as the regular maSdar ٌ وُصول
“arrival.” And from the verb َ“ وَعَدto promise,” we can derive ٌ“ مَوْعِدtime  
appointment,” which is used commonly, roughly with the same meaning as 
the regular maSdar ٌ“ وَعْدa promise.”
25.1.6 Abstract nouns of quality الـمَصْ دَر الصِّ ناعِي
Abstract nouns in general often end with the nisba adjective doubled yaa’  
followed by the feminine taa’ marbuuTa. MaSdars expresssing abstract nouns 
follow this pattern. This form of maSdar can be derived from other maSdars. 
For example, from the maSdar ٌ“ تَعاوُنcooperation,” we derive by way of adding 
the nisba adjective and the feminine taa’ marbuuTa ٌ“ تَعاوُنِيَّةa cooperative.” This 
form of maSdar is known as a maSdar Sinaaci, a derived maSdar.
In addition, this maSdar is derived from other forms of speech such as 
nouns, adjectives, pronouns or interrogative particles. For example, from the 
noun ٌ“ إِنْسانhuman being, homo sapiens” we derive ٌ“ إِنْسانِيَّةhumanity.” From 
the adjective ٌّ“ حُ رfree,” we derive ٌ“ حُ رِيَّةfreedom.” From the pronoun َ“ هُ وhe,” 
we derive ٌ“ هُ وِيَّةidentity.” Finally, from the interrogative word َ“ كَيْفhow,” we 
derive ٌ“ كَيْفِيَّةquality.”
25.2 B
vio  of maSdars
MaSdars in Arabic behave as regular nouns. They can take the definite article, 
have a suffix pronoun, change number into dual and plural, form IDhaafa-
constructs, and be modified by adjectives. Some maSdars can also behave like 
a verb in retaining the preposition of the original verb or taking a direct object 
if they are derived originally from transitive verbs. maSdars can also substitute 
for dependent clauses with ْ أَنplus a verb in the subjunctive.

25.2.1 Definite and indefinite maSdars
MaSdars are almost always in the definite except in two situations:
1.
When they are used as cognate objects, discussed in some detail in the 
following section.
2.
When they are modified by a delimiting adjective such as ٌ“ كَبريbig,” ٌ طَ ويل
‘long, tall,” ٌ“ قَصريshort,” ٌ“ قَريبnear, realizable,” etc. Consider the follow-
ing examples:
.ًزارَنا زيارَةً طويلَةHe paid us a long visit.
.ًأَكَلْنا أَكْالً كَثرياWe ate a lot.
25.3 Cogn
 o j
s الـمَفْعول الـمُ طْ لَق
MaSdars can also be used as cognate objects, also known as the cognate ac-
cusative form. Cognate objects in Arabic are maSdars derived from related 
verbs, sharing the same consonants. Both the verb and the maSdar must be used 
concomitantly followed by adjectives denoting intensity, length, degree, etc. 
The use of a maSdar plus an adjective amounts to an adverbial function. Note 
the following about cognate objects:
1.
They can be derived from transitive or intransitive verbs.
2.
They tend to be in the accusative case. They are often modified by adjec-
tives indicating quality or quantity, related to duration or intensity.
3.
They tend to be indefinite. Consider the following examples:
.ًنامَت البِنْتُ نَوْماً عَميقاThe girl slept deeply.
.ًمَشَ يْنا مَشْ ياً طَ ويالWe walked a lot.
4.
They can be preceded by the comparative form of adjectives, thus resulting 
in IDhaafa. In this case, the maSdar is in the genitive case. Examine the 
following examples:
.ٍَلَ مُقابَلَةْمقابَلَني أَجHe met me graciously.
.ٍِشَ كَ رَتِ األُسْ تاذَةُ الطّ الِباتِ أَجْ زَلَ شُ كْ رThe teacher (F) thanked the  
students (F) profusely.

5.
When maSdars are preceded by one of the quantifiers such as “ بَعْضsome 
of,” or ّ“ كُلall of” (see Chapter 31), this combination also forms an IDhaafa-
construct. The maSdar in this case is both definite and genitive, as in the 
following examples:
. ِِّبُّهُ كُلَّ احلُبُحتShe loves him a lot.
.ِساعَدَها بَعْضَ الـمُ ساعَدَةHe helped her some.
6.
Cognate objects can be the first noun in an IDhaafa-construct. In this case, 
it cannot have  .الـIn such situations, the maSdar must be accusative but 
without tanwiin, as in the following examples:
.َِخيهِلأ ِساعَدَهُ مُساعَدَةَ األَخHe helped him like a brother.
.ِأَحَ بَّها حُ بَّ األَبِ الِبْنَتِهHe loved her as a father loves  
his daughter.

MaSdars derived from transitive verbs generally maintain the behavior of these 
verbs in taking direct objects. The nouns immediately following the maSdars 
in this case are in the genitive case because they function as the second nouns 
of IDhaafa-constructs. The following nouns in the three sentences below are 
direct objects of the maSdars “ نَيْلobtaining, awarding,” “ زِيارةvisit, visiting,” 
and “ لِقاءmeeting,” respectively. Examine the following sentences:
.َتَكَ لَّمْنا عَنْهُ كَثرياً مُنْذُ نَيْلِ الطّ الِبِ اجلائِزَة
We have talked about the student a lot since his obtaining  
the prize.
.ِأَثْناءَ زِيارَةِ صَ ديقي البِالدَ تَوَقَّفَ كَثرياً يف الـمُ دُ نِ األَثَرِيَّة

We should also note that maSdars can be made definite, like the ones in the 
preceding sentences, by having suffix pronouns, as in the following example:
.شَ جَّ عَت األُمُّ دِراسَ تَهُ تاريخَ مِص
[His] mother encouraged his study of the history of Egypt.

Prepositions that are used with intransitive verbs are maintained with maSdars 
derived from such verbs, as in the following:
.أُحِ بُّ أَنْ أُسافِرَ إىل القاهِرَةI like to travel to Cairo.
.أُحِ بُّ السَّ فَرَ إِىل القاهِرَةI like traveling to Cairo.
. ِأُريدُ أَنْ أَحْ صُ لَ عَىل هذا الكِتابI want to acquire this book.
. ِأُريدُ احلُصولَ عَىل هذا الكِتابI want to acquire this book.

MaSdars can be used to replace the construct ’an and the subjunctive verb form 
to provide stylistic variation in the language. Examine the maSdar in the second 
sentence below, which substitutes for ’an and the subjunctive verb:
.ًأَُحِ بُّ أَنْ أَدْرُسَ كَثرياI like to study a lot.
.ًأَُحِ بُّ الدِّراسَ ةَ كَثرياI like studying a lot.
The choice of using the maSdar instead of ْ أَنplus the subjunctive verb is in-
terchangeable; this is done for stylistic variation. In Chapter 3, lists of verbs 
are provided as well as invariable expressions that require the use of ْ .أَنThese 
verbs and expressions can be followed by maSdars.
The maSdar replacing ْ أَنplus the subjunctive verb must be in the nomina-
tive after phrases such as ْ“ مِنَ الواجِ بِ أَنit is incumbent that,” ْوري أَنَّر مِنَ الض

Verbal nouns: maSdars
327
“it is necessary that,” etc. In this case, the maSdar functions as a subject of the 
sentence. Consider the examples below:
.َِبُ عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَعودَجي
He must return.
.ُِبُ عَلَيْهِ العَوْدَةَجي
It is incumbent upon him to return.
.ُسَ هُلَ عَىل الطّ الِبِ أَنْ يَزورَ عائِلَتَه
It was easy for the student to visit his family.
.ِسَ هُلَ عَىل الطّ الِبِ زِيارَةُ عائِلَتِه
It was easy for the student to visit his family.
.مِنَ الواجِ بِ أَنْ يُسافِرَ أَخي إِىل الكوَيْت
It is necessary that my brother travel to Kuwait.
.مِنَ الواجِ بِ سَ فَرُ أَخي إِىل الكُ وَيْت
It is necessary for my brother to travel to Kuwait.

Another function that maSdars perform in Arabic is to express reasons for ac-
tions performed. If the maSdar is derived from a transitive verb, it must be 
followed by the preposition ِ“ لـfor the purpose of,” plus a noun. The preposi-
tion ِ لـbecomes َ لـif followed by a pronoun.
MaSdars in this construct are indefinite accusative, ending with tanwiin, as 
in the following:
لِـامذا أَقاموا احلَفْلَةَ؟
Why did they hold a party?
.ِأَقاموا احلَفْلَةَ تَكْ ريامً لِلزّائِرِ اجلَديد
They held the party in honor of the new visitor.

Why did the student travel to Beirut?
.ِوت طَ لَباً لِلعِلْمْيرَسافَرَ الطّ الِبُ إِىل ب
The student traveled to Beirut in pursuit of learning.
On the other hand, if the verb from which the maSdar is derived is intransitive, 
the maSdar must be followed by the preposition that is most often associated with 
the intransitive verb. For example, the verbs َ َر“ اِسْ تَفْسto inquire” and َ“ بَحَ ثto 
search” are generally followed by the preposition ْ“ عَنabout,” as in the following:
لـِامذا هاتَفوا بَيْتَ العائِلَةِ؟
Why did they telephone the family’s house?
.ُهاتَفوا بَيْتَ العائِلَةِ اِسْ تِفساراً عَنْه
They called the family’s house to inquire about him.

Why were many advertisements published?
.َت إِعْالناتٌ كَثريَةٌ بَحْ ثاً عَنْهُمِرنُش
Many advertisements were published in search of them.
Additionally, maSdars in this construct can be made definite by the use of  الـor 
by the second definite term of IDhaafa preceded by the preposition ِ“ لـfor, for the 
purpose of,” thus rendering the maSdar to be in the genitive, as in the following:
لِـامذا اِجتَمَعوا؟
Why did they meet?
.ِّاِجْ تَمَعوا لِلحَ ديثِ يف األَمْرِ اهلام
They met to discuss the important issue.

 عَدَم
 عَدَمprecedes maSdars, thus forming IDhaafa-constructs, to express the inverse 
meaning of the maSdars following it. Its case can vary depending on its func-
tion in the sentence. However, the noun following  عَدَمmust always be in the 
genitive, as in the following examples:
. َعَدَمُ النَّوْمِ يُسَ بِّبُ املَرَض
Lack of sleep causes illness.
ما رَأْيُكُ م يف عَدَمِ الصِّ دْقِ ؟
What do you think of lack of truthfulness?
.ِيُعاين دائِامً مِن عَدَمِ االسْ تِعدادِ لالمْتِحان
He always suffers from a lack of preparation for the examinations.
. ِِبُّ عَدَمَ الصِّ دْقُحال ي
He does not like falsehoods.

In Arabic, a diminutive is a form that a noun takes to convey a distinct char­
acteristic of smallness. The diminutive of a noun can be used for a number of 
reasons. One such reason is simply to provide a more accurate representation of 
the entity described. For example, to describe a mountain lacking the scale of a 
big mountain, the diminutive noun ٌ“ جُ بَيْلa little mountain” is used instead of 
ٌ“ جَ بَلa mountain.”
Diminutive nouns are also used to express endearment, as in َّ“ يا بُنَيO, my 
dear [little] son!”, “ يا بُنَيَّتيO, my dear [little] daughter!”, or “ يا أُخَ يَّتيO, my dear 
[little] sister!” In addition, diminutive nouns may be used to express contempt, 
as in ٌ“ عُ وَيْلِمa little scholar,” to describe someone pretending to be ٌ“ عالِـمa 
scholar,” but who has not attained, in reality, the stature of a recognized scholar, 
or ٌ“ شُ وَيْعِرan insignificant poet,” instead of ٌ“ شاعِرa [recognized] poet.”
The most commonly used pattern to form diminutive nouns is ٌ .فُعَيْلAs a 
general rule, the first consonant in this pattern is followed by a Dhamma, the 
second by a fat-Ha, then by a yaa’ not followed by a vowel and the last con­
sonant of the noun. Thus, from ٌ“ كَلْبa dog,” we obtain the nouns ٌ كُلَيْب
“a little dog, a puppy,” and from ٌ ْر“ قَصa palace,” ٌ ْر“ قُصَ يa small palace.”
Feminine nouns are derived according to the pattern  فُعَيْلplus the feminine 
marker, the taa’ marbuuTa, i.e. ٌ .فُعَيْلَةThus we obtain ٌ“ دُوَيْلَةa small state,” from 
ٌ“ دَوْلَةa body politic,” ٌ“ قُفَيْفَةa little basket,” from the noun ٌ“ قُفَّةa basket,” and 
ٌَةْر“ شُ جَ يa little tree,” from ٌ“ شَ جَ رَةa tree.”
Other diminutive feminine nouns may end with an ’alif  maqSuura, as in 
 ,سُ لَيْمىSulayma, a woman’s name, from the name  سَ لْمىSalma, or they may 
end with a regular ’alif followed by a hamza, as in اءْرَيُم ,حfrom ْراءَم ,حalso a 
woman’s name but now archaic.
Diminutive noun forms are used in names of people, both masculine and 
feminine (some such names are historical; others are outmoded), and in the 
names of ancient, as well as extant, Arab tribes, cities, and other localities, as 
in the following examples:

Diminutive nouns
333
Diminutive nouns of quadriliteral (four consonant) nouns in Arabic can 
also be formed according to  ,فُعَيْعِلas in ِمْه“ دُرَيa little coin,” from “ دِرْهَمa 
monetary unit, Gk. drachma.” The diminutive form ِمْه دُرَيis often used in the 
plural, i.e. ِامتْه ,دُرَيto express the notion of a small amount of money, as in the 
following example:
.ٍِامتٍ قَليلَةْهى أَرْضَ بَيْتِهِ بِدُ رَيَراِشْ ت
He bought the land of his house for little money.
Another pattern used to generate diminutives from quadriliteral nouns is  ,فُعَيْعيل
which produces “ قُنَيْديلa little lamp,” from “ قِنْديلa lamp.” Some of these 
quadriliteral and cinqueliteral [i.e. five consonant] nouns were borrowed into 
Arabic from Greek, Latin, and Persian.
Diminutives can be formed from certain adverbs of time and/or place  
according to the  فُعَيْلpattern. Thus, we obtain َ“ قُبَيْلa little before” from َ قَبْل
“before” and َ“ بُعَيْدa little after” from َ“ بَعْدafter,” for both time and place. 
Examine the use of these diminutives in the following sentences:
.ِسافَروا قُبَيْلَ الظُّ هْر
They traveled a little before noon.
.ِوَصَ لوا قُبَيْلَ الفَجْ ر
They arrived a little before dawn.
.مَشَ يْنا حَ تّى بُعَيْدَ مَرّاكِش
We walked until a little [distance] after Marrakesh.
.ِوَقَفوا يف الطَّ ريقِ بُعَيْدَ الـمَدينَة
They stopped on their way a little [distance] after Medina.
Verbs, pronouns, attributes of God, days of the week, interrogative words, and 
conditional words cannot be formed in the diminutive.

27.1 The Func ion o  Adjec ives
The primary use of adjectives in languages is to modify nouns, in order to add 
more information about them. In Arabic, modifying adjectives are placed 
after nouns and exhibit total agreement in form. In other words, they agree with 
the nouns they modify in gender (masculine or feminine), number (singular, 
dual or plural), case (nominative, accusative or genitive), and, finally, in deter­
mination (definite or indefinite). The following examples illustrate these points:
.ُوَصَ لَتِ الطّ الِبَةُ اجلَديدَةThe new student (F) arrived.
. َّ ِيشاهَدَ الطّ الِبُ الـمُ عَلِّمَ الفِرَنسThe student (M) saw the French  
teacher (M).
.ٍحَ صَ لَ عَىل كِتابٍ جَ ديدHe obtained a new book.
The adjective ُ اجلَديدَةin the first sentence modifies ُ الطّ الِبَةand agrees with this 
noun in definiteness, gender, number and case. Similarly, َيسْ( الفِرَنor ّيسْ )الفَرَن
in the second sentence agrees with َ الـمُ عَلِّمin these four aspects: definiteness, 
gender, number and case. In the last sentence, there is also complete agreement 
in case, gender, number and determination between the noun ٍ كِتابand its 
modifier ٍ.جَ ديد
In addition to modifying nouns and adding information about them, adjec­
tives can also be used as predicates of equational sentences. Adjectives func­
tioning as predicates agree with the subject nouns in gender, case and number 
only but must always be indefinite, as in the following examples:
.ٌالطّ الِبَةُ جَ ديدَةThe student (F) is new.
.ٌالـمُ دَرِّسُ مَشْ هورThe instructor (M) is famous.
APT R 27
Comparative adjectives أَسْ امءُ التَّفضيل

Note that ٌ جَ ديدةas predicate in the first sentence agrees with the subject ُ اَلطالِبة
in number, gender and case. It is indefinite because it is no longer used as an 
adjective to modify ُ .الطالِبةIt is used as predicate of the sentence. In other words, 
this indefinite adjective is used not to modify ُ الطّ الِبةbut to complete the sentence. 
ٌ مَشْ هورin the second sentence functions in the same way as ٌ جَ ديدةin the first.
27.2 
om
ive Adjec ives
Adjectives can not only modify nouns (see Chapter 4 on adjectives) but can be 
used to compare two nouns with respect to some shared feature or features. 
When we compare two cities with respect to size, for example, the form of the 
adjective used assumes a different shape from the regular degree. This use of 
adjectives is referred to as the comparative degree. Examine the following 
sentences:
.ٌالقاهِرة كَبريَةCairo is big.
.ُ مِن دِمَشْ قَرالقاهِرة أَكْبCairo is bigger than Damascus.
Note that in the first sentence, the feminine adjective ٌ كَبريَةfunctions as a 
predicate of the subject  .القاهِرةIn the second sentence, we obtain another form 
of the adjective, related phonetically and semantically to ٌ .كَبريIt is used in the 
comparison of “ القاهِرَةCairo” and “ دِمَشْ قDamascus” with respect to their 
sizes. The comparative form of adjectives is characterized by the following:
1.
They are always derived according to the ُ أَفْعَلpattern. The derived adjec­
tive form must always be followed by the preposition  مِنwhen comparing 
two entities. Thus, the comparative adjective of ٌيلَم“ جbeautiful” is َلُ مِنْم أَج
“more beautiful than,” and so on.
2.
In adjectives that have identical consonants such as ٌ“ عَزيزdear,” ٌ“ جَ ديدnew,” 
and ٌ“ لَذيذdelicious,” the comparative degree of such adjectives is derived 
according to the ُ أَفْعَلpattern by geminating the duplicated consonants. In 
other words, one consonant is doubled in pronunciation. Only one con­
sonant is used in the orthography, marked by the use of a shadda. Thus, 
we obtain ُّ“ أَعَزdearer,” ُّ“ أَجَ دnewer,” and ُّ“ أَلَذmore delicious.” Examine 
the following sentences:

.صَ ديقي أَعَزُّ مِن أَخي
My friend is dearer [to me] than my brother.
. ِهذا القَميصُ أَجَ دُّ مِن ذلِكَ القَميص
This shirt is newer than that one.
.غَرِرالكَ بابُ أَلَذُّ مِن اهلامْب
Shish kebab is more delicious than hamburger.
3.
Adjectives derived from defective verbs always end with a tanwiin. For 
example ٍ“ عالtall,” ٍ“ دانnear,” ٍ“ سامsublime, noble,” etc. are derived from 
the defective verbs “ عَالto ascend, go up,” “ دَناto become nearer, closer,” 
and “ سَ امto become higher, more sublime,” respectively. The comparative 
forms of such adjectives always end with an ’alif  maqSuura in the writing 
system, as in “ أَعْىل مِنtaller than,” “ أَدْنَى مِنnearer than,” and  أَسْ مَى مِن
“nobler than.” Consider the following examples:
.جَ بَلُ الشَّ يْخِ أَعْىل مِن جِ بالِ عَجْ لون
Mount Hermon is taller than the Ajloun mountains.
.حَ لَب أَدْنى إىل أنْطاكْية مِن دِمَشْ ق
Aleppo is closer to Antioch than Damascus.
.ِاحلُرِّيَةُ أَسْ مى مِن العُبودِيَّة
Freedom is more noble than slavery.
Because of the final ’alif  maqSuura in these adjectives, the case is not marked; 
in other words, the adjectives maintain their form regardless of the case used.
4.
The comparative degree adjective form is invariable, regardless of the  
gender or number of the noun or nouns used in the comparison. However, 
 أَفْعَلform adjectives change case depending on their function in the sentence. 
In other words, the  أَفْعَلform of adjectives can be nominative, accusative 
or genitive. Examine the following examples, and note the case markers of 
the comparative adjectives in them:
.دِمَشْ ق أَقْدَمُ مِن القاهِرَةDamascus is older than Cairo.
.َ مِنْ دِمَشْ ق

It is important to note that no matter how many nouns the subject may 
include, the comparative form is always invariable, as in the following example:
.وت أَقْدَمُ مِن الرِّياضْيرَدِمَشْ ق وَبَغداد وب
Damascus, Baghdad and Beirut are older than Riyadh.

Comparing two or more things in terms of their color requires the use of the 
color’s maSdar preceded by one of two adjectives in the َ أَفْعَلpattern: ُ أَكْثَرfrom 
ٌ“ كَثريmany,” and ُّ أَشَ دfrom ٌ“ شَ ديدstrong,” or ُّ أَقَلfrom ٌ“ قَليلa little.” The case of 
these adjectives is either nominative with one Dhamma, or accusative with one 
fat-Ha, depending on the antecedent noun. The case of the color maSdar must 
always be accusative and indefinite (see Chapter 25, section 25.1.4 for maSdars 
of colors; Chapter 4, section 4.1.2 for color adjectives). The following examples 
are illustrative:
.َِ ةً مِنْ تِلْكَ الشَّ جَ رَةْرهذِهِ الشَّ جَ رَةُ أَكْثَرُ خُ ض
This tree is greener than that one.

ive Adjec ives
In addition to modifying nouns and providing a basis for comparison between 
two nouns that share some feature(s), adjectives can also be used to compare 
an entity with more than two others, with respect to some shared feature or 
features and to identify which entity has the most of this feature. Adjectives 
used to provide this comparison are in the superlative, and their forms are derived 
according to the ُ أَفْعَلpattern. This function can be accomplished in two ways:
1. أَفْعَلforms can be followed by a singular noun which is always both in­
definite and genitive, thus forming an IDhaafa-construct. Like comparative 
adjectives,  أَفْعَلform adjectives are always invariable but the case of the 
adjective forms can vary, depending on their function in the sentence. These 
adjectives can be in the nominative, accusative, or genitive cases. Examine 
the following examples:
.ٍدِمَشْ ق أَقْدَمُ مَدينة
Damascus is the oldest city [in the world].
.ٍزُرْنا أَقْدَمَ مَدينة
We visited the most ancient city [in the world].
.ٍسافَروا إِىل أَقْدَمِ مَدينَة
They traveled to the most ancient city [in the world].
Note that the adjective in the first sentence is in the nominative case, as it 
is the predicate in the equational sentence ٍ .دَمَشْ ق أَقْدَمُ مَدينةThe same adjec­
tive in the sentence ٍ زُرنا أَقْدَمَ مَدينةis in the accusative because it is the direct 
object of the verb  .زُرْناAnd, finally,  أَقْدَمin the last example is in the 
genitive because it is preceded by a preposition.
2. أَفْعَلcan be followed by a plural noun. This noun is always definite and 
also genitive, thus forming an IDhaafa-construct. The preceding examples 
in (1) above are duplicated below, using the plural form of ٌ:مَدينَة
دِمَشْ ق أَقْدَمُ الـمُ دُ نِ.
Damascus is the oldest city. (lit. “the oldest of cities”)

They traveled to the oldest city. (lit. “the oldest of cities”)  
  [in the world]
In addition to the ُ أَفْعَلcomparative pattern, there is a small set of adjectives 
in Arabic that follows a different rule, namely using لْ ,فُعa feminine adjective 
form, to generate the superlative form of the adjective. These feminine  
forms are invariable in case, number, and gender, as illustrated in the table below:

The following two sentences have the same meaning:
. ُِ البَناتَرمَرْيَم أَكْبMaryam is the oldest of the girls.
. َِى البَناتْرمَرْيَم كُبMaryam is the oldest of the girls.
The meaning of these two sentences can also be conveyed by placing  أَكْبor 
َىْر كُبafter the noun. Adjectives in this case must be in the definite, as in the 
examples below:
.ُ َرمَرْيَم البِنْتُ األَكْبMaryam is the oldest girl.
.ىْرمَرْيَم البِنْتُ الكُ بMaryam is the oldest girl.

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar

Adjectives in the َىْر كُبform are used with feminine nouns and always remain 
invariable in any case, as in the following examples:
. َِى البَناتْرمَرْيَم وَهِنْد وَلَيْىل كُب
Miryam, Hind and Leila are the eldest daughters.
. ِى البَناتْررَأَيْتُ كُب
I saw the eldest daughter.
. ِى البَناتْرسافَرْتُ مَعَ كُب
I traveled with the eldest daughter.
With masculine nouns, the comparative ُ أَفْعَلform is used, as in the following 
example:
.َِ الرِّجالَررَأَيْتُ أَكْبI saw the oldest man.
Some adjectives in the لْ فُعpattern have come to collocate with certain nouns, 
especially names of countries or regions, to make a proper noun. Examine the 
following:
آسيا الصُّ غْرىAsia Minor, Turkey
آسيا الوُسْ طَ ىCentral Asia
بَريطانيا العُظْ مَىGreat Britain
ىْر الدُّ وَلُ الكُ بor الدُّ وَلُ العُظْ مىThe Superpowers
Finally, the word ُ“ أَوَّلfirst” has the feminine form  .أَُوىلExamine the following 
sentences:
. ُجورج واشِ نْطُ ن هُ وَ الرَّئيسُ األَوَّل
George Washington is the first president.
. ِمَرْيَم هِيَ أُوىل البَنات
Maryam is the first of the daughters.
.مَرْيَم هِيَ البِنْتُ األُوىل
Maryam is the first daughter. (i.e. the eldest daughter)

In comparing three items in terms of color, the appropriate comparative form 
ُ أَكْثَرor ُّ أَشَ دor ُّ أَقَلis used in addition to the maSdar of the color word. The 
item that is more distinguished in color is listed as well as the other two com­
pared items. This applies to the primary color words like ُ“ أَسْ وَدblack,” َُرْم أَح
“red,” etc. Consider the following example:
.شَ عْرُ لَيْىل أَكْثَرُ سَ واداً مِنْ شَ عْرِ هُ دى ومِنْ شَ عْرِ سَ لْمى
Laila’s hair is more black than Huda and Salma’s hair.
Secondary colors like ٌّ“ بُنِّيbrown,” ٌّ“ زَهْرِيpink,” etc. follow a different struc­
ture, as in the following:
.ثَوْبُ فاطِمَة زَهْرِيٌّ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَوْبِ سامِية ومِنْ ثَوْبِ عالِيَة
Fatima’s dress is more pink than Samia and Alia’s dresses.

There are two types of plural nouns in Arabic: (1) regular and (2) irregular. 
The former is known in Arabic as  ,اجلَمْع املُذَكَّر السّ الtranslated as “sound or 
regular plural.” The latter is known by the Arabic name ْع التَّكسريَم“ جbroken 
plurals.” In the following sections, we shall discuss regular plurals of masculine 
and feminine nouns, followed by irregular plurals and other plurals of various 
nouns.
28.1 Regula  Masculine Plu als اجلَمْع الـمُ ذَكَّر السّ ال
Singular masculine human nouns are changed into their plurals by attaching 
the suffix َ ون-uuna to the end of those nouns. These noun categories follow a 
regular pattern in their pluralization. It should be noted that َ ون-uuna as a 
plural marker of nouns is used to mark the nominative case only. َ ون-uuna 
changes to َ ين-iina when nouns are in either the accusative or the genitive case, 
as in the following examples in which َ مُسْ تَقبِلونis the plural of ٌ:مُسْ تَقْبِل
وَصَ لَ الـمُ سْ تَقْبِلونَ .
The greeters/welcomers arrived. (nominative)
.َشاهَدْنا الـمُ سْ تَقْبِلني
We saw the greeters/welcomers. (accusative)
.َجاءوا مَعَ الـمُ سْ تَقْبِلني
They came with the greeters/welcomers. (genitive)
Nouns that follow this pattern are especially those active or passive participles 
derived from َ فَعَّلverb forms (Form II) through َ( اسْ تَفْعَلForm X) that represent 
human entities. Examples are provided in the table below.

28.1.1 َ( فَعَلForm I) active participle plurals
Active participles derived from َ فَعَلverbs (Form I) present a different, yet  
interesting, way of forming plurals. In general, active participles derived from 
tri-consonantal verbs according to the pattern ٌ فاعِلcan be made plural by the 
use of the suffix َ ون-uuna. Yet some of the active participles derived from this 
form exhibit different plurals in the language. For example, from the verb َ كَتَب
“to write,” we obtain the active participle ٌ“ كاتِبwriter,” the plural of which 

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
344
is ٌ“ كُتّابwriters.” However, the forms َ كاتِبونand ٌ ,كَتَبَةboth meaning “writers,” 
also exist in the language. What is the difference, then, between ٌ كُتّابon the 
one hand, and َ كاتِبونand ٌ كَتَبَةon the other? ٌ كُتّابtends to be used in the sense 
of “[creative, or professional] writers.” Thus, if one were to make a list of 
novelists, essayists, short story writers, journalists, etc. one would use the  
plural ٌ .كُتّابOn the other hand, َ كاتِبونand ٌ كَتَبَةare used to mean just “writers,” 
without the specific and specialized meaning of ٌ .كُتّابFor example, ِ كاتِبو الطَّ لَبات
and ِ“ كَتَبَةُ الطَّ لَباتapplication writers,” convey a special group of writers.
Another example is the active participle ٌ طالِبderived from the verb َ طَ لَب
“to request, seek, order.” The plural forms ٌ طُ الّبand ٌ طَ لَبَةare used to mean 
“students.” We should note that ٌ طُ الّبis more current than ٌ .طَ لَبَةThe regular 
plural form َ طالِبونis used, however, to denote “seekers” or “those who place 
demands in pursuit of a goal,” as in ِّ“ طالِبو احلَقseekers of rights,” and so on.
28.1.1.1 Hollow verbs ُاألفْعالُ اجلَوْفاء
There is a tendency for active participles from hollow verbs to follow the regu
lar pattern of pluralization. Recall that active participles derived from hollow 
verbs substitute a hamza for the missing middle consonant (see Chapter 23  
on active participles). For example, the active participle of َ“ عادto return” is 
ٌ“ عائِدa returner.” The plural follows the regular pattern of having َ ون-uuna 
suffixed to the singular form, as in َ.عائِدون
Not all active participles from hollow verbs follow the pattern of sound 
plurals, however. For example, the plural of ٌ“ زائِرa visitor” could end with 
-uuna, as in َ“ زائِرونvisitors.” The irregular ٌ زُوّارis also an attested, commonly 
used plural form. The question then arises as to which one to adopt, since both 
are accepted and have the same meaning. The answer is quite simple: both are 
seen in writing; however,  زُوّارhas more currency as far as we can ascertain. 
The use of َ زائِرونmay represent a tendency by language speakers toward 
regularization of forms—such tendencies are present in many languages.
28.1.1.2 Defective verbs األفْعال الـمُ عْتَـلَّة اآلخِ ر
Recall that the active participle from the verb “ دَعاto invite” is ٍ“ داعinviter,” 
and from “ مَشىto walk,” we derive ٍ“ ماشa walker” (see Chapter 23 on active 
participles). These active participles tend to have two plural forms, one regular 

Plural nouns
345
and the other irregular. Thus, from ٍ داعwe obtain َ داعونand ٌ دُعاةand from ٍ ماش
we derive َ ماشونand ُ .مُشاةBoth plurals are used, although they convey different 
nuances of meaning. َ ,داعونfor example, as in ٍ ,داعونَ إىل حَ فْلَةis used in the 
sense of mundane “inviters, hosts,” whereas ٌ دُعاةhas a loftier meaning, as 
in ِ“ دُعاةُ  العَدْلadvocates of justice,” or preachers; َ ماشونdenotes “walkers,” 
whereas ٌ مُشاةconnotes “pedestrians,” and also infantry in the army.
Note that the plural of such words results in the dropping of the yaa’.  
This is because of the impossibility of combining two different vowels in  
Arabic. Thus, the plural forms of  الـاميشand  الدّاعيare َ الـامشونand َ الدّاعون
respectively.
28.1.1.3 Doubled verbs ُاألفْعالُ الـمُ ضَ عَّفَة
Masculine plurals of active participles derived from this verb category are made 
regular by suffixing َ ون-uuna in the nominative case and َ ين-iina in the accusa-
tive and genitive cases. Recall that the doubled, geminated consonant at the 
end of Form I doubled verbs produces a final consonant in the active participle 
which is also doubled and geminated. In the writing system, this is indicated 
by writing the consonant in question with a shadda. Active participles from the 
verbs َّ“ عَدto count” and َّ“ شَ كto doubt” are ٌّ“ عادone who counts” and ٌّ شاك
“a doubter,” respectively, and are rendered plural in the nominative as َ عادّون
“those who count, counters” and َ“ شاكّونdoubters,” and as َ عادّينand َ شاكّني
in the accusative and genitive, respectively.
28.1.1.4 Regular masculine plural nouns in IDhaafa
The nuun at the end of these plural nouns, regardless of their case, is dropped when 
they are used as a part of an IDhaafa-construct, as in the following examples:
.ِوَصَ لَ مُعَلِّمو الـمَدرَسَ ة
The schoolteachers arrived.
.ِشاهَدْنا مُعَلِّمي الـمَدْرَسَ ة
We saw the schoolteachers.
.ِسافَرَتْ مَعَ مُعَلِّمي الـمَدرَسَ ة
She traveled with the schoolteachers.

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
346
If suffix pronouns are attached to plural nouns ending with a nuun, the nuun 
is dropped before attaching the suffix pronouns, as in the following examples:
.وَصَ لَ مُعَلِّموناOur teachers arrived.
.شاهَدْنا مُعَلِّميكُ مWe saw your (M, Pl) teachers.
.سافَرَت مَعَ مُعَلِّميهاShe traveled with her teachers.
28.2 Regula  Fe
inine Plu als اجلَمْع الـمُ ؤَنَّث السّ ال
Thus far, we have been examining regular masculine plural nouns, with an 
occasional reference to feminine nouns. We now turn to examining the forma-
tion of regular plural feminine nouns. Feminine nouns show more regularity 
than their masculine counterparts in plural formation. Feminine sound plurals 
are formed by suffixing to the feminine singular noun -aatun ٌ اتin the nomina-
tive, and -aatin ٍ اتin the accusative and genitive.
One way to pluralize feminine nouns is by dropping the taa’ marbuuTa of 
singular feminine nouns and replacing it with ٌ .اتAnother way of pluralizing 
is to replace the fat-Ha preceding the taa’ marbuuTa with an ’alif (essentially 
elongating it) and then changing the taa’ marbuuTa to a regular “open” taa’. 
Thus, ٌ“ مُعَلِّمَةa teacher (F),” becomes ٌ“ مُعَلِّامتteachers (F),” and ٌ“ طالِبَةa student 
(F),” becomes ٌ“ طالِباتstudents (F).”
Consider the following examples:
. ٍشاهَدْنا مُعَلِّامتWe saw teachers (F).
. ٍجاءَ مَعَ مُعَلِّامتHe came with teachers (F).
. ِشاهَدْنا الـمُ عَلِّامتWe saw the teachers (F).
. ِجاءَ مَعَ الـمُ عَلِّامتHe came with the teachers (F).
The preceding feminine plural nouns all indicate human nouns. Non-human 
feminine singular nouns form their plurals in this regular way as well. For 
example, the plural of ٌ“ طاوِلَةa table” is ٌ“ طاوِالتtables,” and the plural of 
ٌ“ جامِعةa university” is ٌ“ جامِعاتuniversities,” and so on.
A word of caution, however, is in order. It does not follow that every noun 
ending with a feminine marker is made plural by suffixing ٌ ات-aatun. For 

Plural nouns
347
example, the plurals of ٌ“ مَدْرَسَ ةa school” and ٌ“ جَ ريدَةa newspaper” are ُ مَدارِس
“schools” and ُ“ جَ رائِدnewspapers.” Such irregular forms are learned through 
exposure to the language and frequent usage.
28.3 
egula  (B oken) Plu als ُِوعُ التَّكْ سريُمج
ُوعُ التَّكسريُِم“ جbroken plurals” are formed in four ways:
1.
By internal vowel change in the singular form. For example, ٌ“ كِتابa book” 
becomes ٌ“ كُتُبbooks” in the plural.
2.
By doubling a consonant in the singular noun, in addition to internal vowel 
change. For example, the plural of ٌ“ طالِبa student” is ٌ“ طُ الّبstudents.” 
ٌ طَ لَبَةalso exists but may be used less frequently.
3.
By using a prefix, usually a hamza plus a fat-Ha َ ,أin addition to the internal 
vowel change. For example, ٌ“ وَلَدa boy, offspring” becomes ٌ“ أَوْالدboys, 
children” and ٌ“ بابa door” becomes ٌ“ أَبْوابdoors.”
4.
By adding the prefix hamza and a suffix, also a hamza, in addition to internal 
vowel change. For example, the plural of ٌ“ صَ ديقa friend” is ُ“ أَصْ دِقاءfriends” 
and ٌ“ قَريبa relative” is ُ“ أَقْرِباءrelatives.”
It is not possible to establish one master rule about the formation of  
broken plurals. Learners eventually become acquainted with these plural  
forms through practice and exposure to the language, written or spoken. We 
provide below the most commonly used broken plural patterns. Singular  
nouns are provided with their irregular plurals in parentheses, along with their 
meanings:

Note that we have marked some of these patterns with asterisks for good  
reason. Such plural nouns end only with one Dhamma in the nominative case 
and cannot have a tanwiin. In the genitive and accusative they take one fat-Ha. 
This will be explained in more detail in Chapter 29.
Finally, we should cite at least one example where the plural noun does 
not resemble its singular. The plural of ٌ مَرْأَةand ٌ ,اِمْرَأَةboth meaning “a woman,” 
is ٌ“ نِساءwomen.” This phenomenon of lacking phonetic similarity between related 
words such as in ٌ مَرْأَةٌ / اِمْرَأَةand ٌ نِساءis called suppletion. This phenomenon 

Plural nouns
351
occurs in many languages. For example, there is no phonetic similarity between 
the English verb “go” and its past tense “went,” or between the cardinal num-
ber “one” and its ordinal form “first.” It should be mentioned that ٌ نِساءas a 
plural form of ٌ اِمْرَأَةis genetically related to the nouns ٌ“ إِنْسانhomo sapiens,” ٌ إِنْس
“humankind,” ٌ“ آنِسَ ةyoung, unmarried lady, miss,” and ٌ“ ناسpeople, human 
beings.”
28.4 Place 
oun Plu als ُْعُهَماِسْ مُ الـمَكان وج
Plural nouns are also regularly formed in the case of place nouns, i.e. nouns 
derived from tri-consonantal verbs to denote places. There are two patterns 
that can be used to generate singular place nouns in Arabic, namely ٌ مَفْعَل
with a penultimate fat-Ha and, in a limited number of nouns, ٌ مَفعِلwith a 
penultimate kasra. In some other nouns we also encounter the feminine coun-
terparts of those patterns, namely ٌ مَفْعَلَةand ٌ .مَفعِلَةThus, from َ“ كَتَبto write,” 
we obtain ٌ“ مَكْ تَبoffice, bureau,” according to the ٌ مَفْعَلpattern, and we obtain 
“ مَدْرَسَ ةa school” from َ“ دَرَسto study,” according to the ٌ مَفعَلَةpattern. The 
following place nouns can be put in the plural according to the ُ مَفاعِلpattern. 
Note that these plural nouns end with only one Dhamma; they never end with 
a tanwiin.
Also note that ٌ“ مَكْ تَبَةa library, a bookstore” is a place noun derived from 
the verb َ“ كَتَبto write,” according to the feminine place noun pattern ٌ .مَفعَلَة
Its plural, however, follows the regular pattern of suffixing ٌ ات-aatun, as in 
ٌ“ مَكْ تَباتlibraries, bookstores.” On the other hand, ٌ“ مَكْ تَبoffice, desk” is also 
a place noun derived from the verb َ ;كَتَبyet its plural follows the ُ مَفاعِلpat-
tern, thus obtaining ُ .مَكاتِبThis is indeed an interesting phenomenon in the 
language. The addition of the taa’ marbuuTa to ٌ مَكْ تَبgenerates ٌ .مَكْ تَبَةPerhaps 
this is a way to distinguish the two place nouns, derived from the same root, 
from each other and indicate their different meanings. It is also interesting to 
note that historically, the place where books were stored or housed was referred 
to as “ دار الكُ تُبhouse of books.”  مَكْ تَبwas used to denote what is now re-
ferred to in Modern Standard Arabic as “ مَدْرَسَ ةschool.”

The previous section treated nouns that denote places derived from tri-
consonantal verbs. Plurals of such nouns tend to follow rules. This section will 
introduce another type of noun in Arabic, nouns that denote instruments, 
which are also derived from tri-consonantal verbs. Plurals of these nouns also 
follow regular patterns.
There are three patterns used to generate singular instrument nouns in 
Arabic: (1) ٌ ,مِفْعَلَة2  ٌ ,مِفْعَلand (3) ٌ .مِفْعالNote that ٌ مِفْعَلَةhas a feminine end-
ing. Thus, from َ“ فَتَحto open” we derive ٌ“ مِفْتاحa key, an instrument that 
opens,” according to the ٌ مِفْعالpattern. From َ“ بَرَدto file (metal)” we obtain 
ٌَدْر“ مِبa file,” according to ٌ .مِفْعَلAnd, finally, from َ“ كَنَسto sweep” we obtain 
ٌ“ مِكْ نَسَ ةa broom,” according to ٌ.مِفْعَلَة
Instrument nouns derived according to ٌ مِفْعالare made plural according to 
the ُ مَفاعيلpattern. For example, the plural of ٌ“ مِفتاحa key” is ُ .مَفاتيحNote 
that this plural form does not end with a tanwiin (see Chapter 29 on indeclin-
able nouns). On the other hand, plural nouns derived according to ٌ مِفْعَلand 
ٌ مِفْعَلَةpatterns are made plural according to one pattern, namely ُ .مَفاعِلThus 
the plural of ٌَدْر“ مِبa file” is ُ“ مَبارِدfiles”; the plural of ٌ“ مِكْ نَسَ ةa broom” is 
ُ“ مَكانِسbrooms.” Plural nouns according to the ُ مَفاعِلpattern do not end with 
a tanwiin (see Chapter 29 on indeclinable nouns).

plural forms, and their meanings:

In recent years, the Arabic language academies (in Amman, Baghdad, Cairo 
and Damascus) have sanctioned words derived according to the ٌ فَعّالpattern, 
the more commonly used feminine pattern ٌ فَعّالَةand their plural forms accord-
ing to ٌ فَعّاالتas means of deriving instrument nouns. Examples in these pat-
terns are provided below:

We should note that while ٌ“ طَ يّارَةairplane” is derived according to this pattern 
and is commonly used in daily speech, the form ٌ طائِرَةhas been sanctioned as 
a loftier lexical item used in more formal situations, as in formal writing. On 
the other hand, common usage has popularized the use of ٌ“ مُنْخُ لa sieve,” 
instead of the expected ٌ.مِنْخَ ل
In addition, common usage has created doublets in the language. Examples 
include ٌ خَ الّطand ٌ“ خَ الّطَ ةa mixer,” ٌ خَ رّاطand ٌ“ خَ رّاطَ ةa turner,” ٌ مِقْرَضand 
ٌ“ مِقْراضscissors,” and ٌ َر مِسْ بand ٌ“ مِسْ بارexplorer.”

ُاَألَسْ امءُ اخلَمْسَ ة
The following five singular nouns, known by the Arabic name  األَسامءُ اخلَمْسَ ة
“the five nouns,” are marked by a waaw in the nominative case, an ’alif in the 
accusative, and a yaa’ in the genitive. Some grammarians include a sixth noun 
which is, in essence, rarely used; therefore, we will restrict the discussion here 
to the following five only.
Nominative

The long vowels for the three different cases are assumed only under two  
conditions:
1.
When these nouns are in the IDhaafa-construct, as in the examples below:
. ِوَصَ لَ أَبو الطّ الِبِ أَمْسThe student’s father arrived yesterday.
. ِشاهَدْنا أَخا العَريسWe saw the bridegroom’s brother.
يكِ ؟َمهَلْ تَكَ لَّمَ مَعَ حDid he speak to your (F) father-in-law?
2.
When they have a suffix pronoun attached to them, which is, in fact,  
a form of IDhaafa, as in the following examples:
يا مَرْيَم، أَيْنَ أَبوكِ ؟Maryam, where is your father?
هَلِ السَّ يّارَةُ مَعْ أَخيكَ ؟Is the car with your (M) brother?
Two things should be mentioned about these five nouns. First, there exist  
in the language four “counter-nouns” to the five nouns above. There is no 

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
358
counterpart to “ ذوowner of.” Instead of the long vowels, these counter nouns 
end with Dhamma in the nominative case, with a fat-Ha in the accusative and 
with a kasra in the genitive when the definite article  اَلـis prefixed to them. 
Thus, for example, for ُ“ اَألَبthe father,” َ اَألَبand ِ اَألبare realized. When 
these nouns are indefinite, the case markers are duplicated, thus resulting in a 
tanwiin written on a dummy ’alif in the accusative only, as in the table below:
Nominative
Accusative
Genitive
Meaning
ٌأَب

ٌأَخ
أَخاً
أَخٍbrother
ٌحَ م
اًَمح
حَ مٍin-law
ٌفَم
فَامً
فَمٍmouth
Second, “ فوmouth” is obsolete and is rarely used except in frozen phrases. ٌ فَم
is more frequently used instead. وَم“ حfather-in-law” is seen only in highly liter-
ary styles. The following sentences illustrate how these nouns are used:
.ٍسافَرَ األَبُ قَبْلَ ساعَةThe father left an hour ago.
هَلْ سَ تُقابِلُ األخَ ؟Will you meet the brother?
. ِاألَلـَمُ يف الفَمِ ولَيْسَ يف الرَّأْسThe pain is in the mouth, not in the head.
The plurals of these five nouns are irregular, as shown below:
(ٌآباء ٌأَبfathers
( ٌإِخْ وان ، ٌإِخْ وَة ٌأَخbrothers
(ٌاءْمأَح ٌحَ مin-laws
(ٌأَفْواه فوmouths
(ذَوو ذوowners of
The plural of ٌ“ فَمmouth” is ٌ“ أَفْاممmouths,” a noun that is not commonly used. 
ٌ أَفْواهenjoys more currency and is used in frozen structures as in the  
following:

Plural nouns
359
!خُ ذوا احلِكْ مَةَ من أَفْواهِ املَجانني
Seek wisdom from the mouths of fools.
Additionally, “ ذوowner of, holder of” has a feminine counterpart, namely 
 ,ذاتas in the example below:
.ًتِلْكَ الـمَرْأَةُ ذاتُ الشَّ عْرِ األَسْ وَدِ تَعْمَلُ طَ بيبَة
That woman with black hair works as a physician.
Finally,  ذاتhas the plural  ,ذَواتas in phrases such as ِ النِّساءُ ذَواتُ الـاملِ الكَ ثري
“women of abundant means, who have lots of money.”  ذَواتalso connotes 
those who are well-placed in society, as in ِ“ أَبْناءُ الذَّواتchildren of the upper 
crust [in society].”

A reference to one instance of collective or mass nouns can be expressed by 
making the collective noun into a feminine singular by suffixing a taa’ marbuuTa, 
the feminine marker. For example, we obtain ٌ“ خَ شَ بَةone piece of wood”  
from the mass noun ٌ“ خَ شَ بwood,” and ٌ“ وَرَقَةone piece of paper” from ٌ وَرَق
“paper.”
Unit nouns can be made plural to indicate a number of distinct individuals 
of collective nouns. This is accomplished by the addition of the regular femi-
nine plural marker ٌات-, as in, for example:
ٍسَ بْعُ دَجاجاتseven chickens
ٍُ وَرَقاتْرعَشten sheets of paper
Often a noun expressing a “unit” or “measure” is used with instances of  
collective nouns. For example, ٌْمَةَلح “a piece of meat” is more appropriately 
expressed by the use of ْ“ قِطْ عَةٌ مِنa piece of,” as in ِ“ قِطْ عَةٌ مِن اللَحْ مa piece of 
meat.” Other words are used to express the unit noun, as in the following:

ٌَةْر كِسa piece, as in ٍَةُ خُ بْزْر كِسor َِةٌ مِنَ اخلُبْزْر كِسa morsel of bread
Other measure nouns such as ٌ“ فِنْجانa cup of,” ٌ“ كَأْسa glass of,” or ٌ مِلْعَقَة
“a spoon of” are often used with mass or collective nouns, as in the  
following:
ٍ فِنْجانُ قَهْوَةor ِفِنْجانٌ مِنَ القَهْوَةa cup of coffee
ٍ كَأْسُ ماءor كَأْسٌ مِنَ الـامءa glass of water

This noun form expresses a single occurrence of a generic action. It is often 
formed by the addition of the feminine marker such as a taa’ marbuuTa to  
the maSdar, the verbal noun. To form this single-occurrence noun, the verbal 
noun of َ فَعَلverbs (Form I) is constructed according to the  فَعْلpattern. Thus, 
the maSdar from the verb َ“ أَكَلto eat” is ٌ“ أَكْلeating, act of eating,” and one  
instance of eating is ٌ . أَكْلَةFrom the verb َ بَر“ ضto hit” we obtain the maSdar 
ٌْ بَر“ ضact of hitting, hitting.” The noun of a single occurrence is ٌْ بَةَر ض
“one hit.”
Hollow verbs form this single occurrence noun in the same manner.  
From ُ“ قامَ  /  يَقومto stand up, to rise” we obtain ٌ“ قَوْمَةuprising,” and from  
ُ“ صاحَ / يَصيحto shout” we obtain ٌ“ صَ يْحَ ةone shout, one crying out.”
Single-occurrence nouns are formed from defective verbs in the same  
manner. From “ غَزا  /  يَغْزوto invade, to raid,” for example, we obtain ٌ غَزْوَة
“one invasion, one raid” and from “ رَمى/ يَرْميto throw” we obtain ٌ“ رَمْيَةone 
throw.”

MaSdars of َ( فَعَّلForm II) through َ( اِسْ تَفْعَلForm X) verbs are used to form this 
type of noun in a similar fashion. While some nouns of single occurrence can 
be formed according to these rules, it should be emphasized that not many of 
them are actually used in the singular. Their plurals, however, are common.

Note that if the maSdar ends with a taa’ marbuuTa, the word ً“ مَرَّةone time, 
one occurrence” or ً“ مَرَّةً واحِ دَةone occurrence” is used. Thus, instead of using 
the maSdar, such verbs are used with the word ً ,مَرَّةas in the following:

Nouns that indicate performers of a trade or a profession are usually formed 
from tri-consonantal verbs according to the ٌ فَعّالpattern. Thus, from َ“ طَ بَخto 
cook” we obtain ٌ“ طَ بّاخa cook,” and from َ“ صَ بَغto paint, to dye” we obtain 
ٌ“ صَ بّاغpainter, dyer,” etc. Additionally, profession nouns are derived from  
regular nouns. From the noun ٌ“ سَ مَكfish” we obtain ٌكّماَ“ سfisherman,” i.e. 
the person connected to fish, be he the seller or catcher of fish. The following 
are some common nouns of profession derived from nouns:
ٌ حَ دّادblacksmith, from ٌ حَ ديدiron
ٌ عَطّ ارperfume maker, from ٌ عِطْ رperfume
ٌ لَـحّ امbutcher, meat seller, from ٌ لَـحْ مmeat
The following are common nouns of profession derived from verbs:
ٌ خَ بّازbread maker, from َ خَ بَزto make bread, or to sell it
ٌ رَسّ امdrawer, draftsman from َ رَسَ مto draw, draft
The plural of such nouns is regular by the suffixing of َ ون-uuna in the  
nominative, and َ ين-iina in the accusative and genitive. These and other  
nouns denoting profession or trade are commonly used in Arab family names, 
parallel to the English family names Painter, Cooper, Thatcher, and so on. 
Below are a few sentences that illustrate how profession nouns are used in the 
plural:
.ِيَصْ نَعُ العَطّ ارونَ العُطورَ مِنَ الزُّهور
Perfume makers make perfumes from flowers.
.َالبِالدُ بِحاجَ ةٍ إِىل خَ بّازينَ ولَـحّ امني
The country is in need of bakers and butchers.
We should also add that other forms of profession nouns exist in the lang
uage beyond the preceding patterns. There are, for example, nouns derived 
according to  ,اِسْ مُ الفاعِلthe active participle, as in ٌ“ مُصَ وِّرphotographer,” and 
the like.

We mentioned in a previous section that active participles derived from tri-
consonantal verbs according to the  فاعِلpattern are used primarily as nouns 
and secondarily as adjectives. Some of these active participles generate, accord-
ing to the ٌ فَعّالpattern, nouns indicating intensity. Thus from ٌ“ كاذِبa liar,” 
which is derived from ُ“ كَذَبَ / يَكْ ذِبto tell lies,” we obtain ٌ“ كَذّابhabitual 
liar, one who is known for his [repeated] lies,” and from ٌ“ ناظِمa lyric writer,” 
we obtain ٌ“ نَظّ امa prolific lyric writer.”
The pattern ٌ فَعولalso conveys intensity or excess, as in ٌ“ أَكولa gluttonous 
eater,” or ٌ“ كَذوبa habitual liar.” Furthermore, nouns derived according to the 
 مِفْعالpattern also convey this sense of a person performing actions in height-
ened degrees. Thus we realize “ مِقْدامa man with a high level of courage,” 
“ مِفْضالa man who performs generous deeds,” “ مِزْواجone who marries  
frequently,” and so on.
Forms that indicate intensity may end with a taa’ marbuuTa. Thus, from 
ٌِم“ عالa savant, a learned person” (derived from َ“ عَلِمto know”), we derive ٌ عَالّمَة
“a very learned person.” Other nouns in this pattern include ٌ“ رَحّ الَةan avid 
traveler,” ٌ“ نَسّ ابَةa famous genealogist,” ٌ“ فَهّامَةextremely capable of understand-
ing,” etc. Despite the fact that these nouns end with a taa’ marbuuTa, they are 
masculine in their syntactic behavior. The plurals of such nouns are made 
regular by suffixing َ ون-uuna, as in the following:
.ٌٌّ مَشْ هور

nite, as in the following examples:
. َوَصَ لَ الـمُ درِّسونَ الـمَشْ هورون
The famous professors (M, Pl) arrived.
. َقابَلَ الـمُ ديرُ الـمُ دَرِّسنيَ الـمَشْ هورين
The principal met with the famous teachers.
Certain adjectives do not assume the regular plural marker َ ونin the nomina-
tive or َ ينin the accusative and genitive when used with masculine plural human 
nouns. Examine the following list of adjectives in the singular and plural:

To illustrate how they modify regular plural nouns, examine the following sentences:
.َُ الـمُ عَلَّمونَ اجلُدُ دَرحَ ضThe new teachers arrived.
.َسَ وْفَ نُشاهِدُ الـمُ سافِرينَ الصِّ غارWe shall see the young passengers.
.َُ الـمُ وظَّ فونَ الكِبارَرحَ ضThe top-ranking employees arrived.
.ِنَتَكَ لَّمُ عَن الكُ تّابِ العِظامWe talk about the famous writers.

Plural nouns

The above adjectives, however, assume the regular feminine ending when used 
with regular feminine plural human nouns, as in the following:
. َُ تِ الـمُ عَلِّامتُ اجلَديداتَرحَ ضThe new teachers (F, Pl) arrived.
. ِسَ وْفَ نُشاهِدُ البَناتِ الصَّ غرياتWe shall see the young girls.
. ِنَتَكَ لَّمُ عَنِ الكاتِباتِ العَظيامتWe talk about the famous  
writers (F, Pl).
Adjectives for non-human plural nouns must be in the feminine singular, as in 
the examples below:
.َُ تِ السَّ يّاراتُ اجلَديدَةَرحَ ضThe new cars arrived.
.َقَرَأَ الكُ تُبَ اجلَديدَةHe read the new books.
.َزاروا الـمُ دُ نَ الكَ بريَةThey visited the big cities.
One encounters examples where plural (instead of singular) adjectives are used 
with non-human nouns, such as:
.ًأَقاموا يف هذِهِ البِالدِ سَ نَواتٍ طِواالThey resided in this country for  
many years.
Nisba adjectives modifying regular masculine or feminine human nouns show 
agreement with such nouns. For example, the nisba adjective derived from  أَمريكا
is ٌّ .أَمريكِيThis adjective has regular endings in the plural, as in the examples 
below:
. ََ الـمُ دَرِّسونَ األَمْريكيّونَرحَ ضThe American teachers (M) came.
. َُ تِ الـمُ دَرِّساتُ األَمْريكيّاتَرحَ ضThe American teachers (F) came.
If this same adjective modifies a non-human plural noun, however, the adjec-
tive form must be in the feminine singular, as in the following example:
.َُ تِ السّ يّاراتُ األَمْريكيَّةَرحَ ضThe American cars arrived.

ollec ive/Mass 
ouns اِسْ مُ اجلِنْس / النَّوْع
Nouns representing entities that form a class of their own, such as chickens, 
oranges, or a mass such as bread or wood, are a class of nouns called  
ِ اِسْ مُ اجلِنْسor ِ اِسْ مُ النَّوْعin Arabic. Here is a list illustrating this noun group:
ٌ خَ شَ بwood
ٌْمَلح meat
ٌ خُ بْزbread
ٌ دَجاجchickens
ٌ بُرتُقالoranges
ٌ وَرَقpaper
Such nouns are always masculine and singular in their syntactic behavior, as 
illustrated in the following examples:
.ِاخلَشَ بُ مُسْ تَعْمَلٌ يف البِناءWood is used in construction.
. َّأُحِ بَّ الدَّجاجَ الـمَشْ وِيI like grilled chicken.
.ِْتُقالُ مُفيدٌ لِلصِّ حَّ ةُرالبOranges are beneficial to health.
Also some of these nouns relate to unit nouns (see above). From ٌ بُرْتُقال
“oranges” we obtain ٌ“ بُرْتُقالَةone orange,” and from ٌ“ وَرَقpaper” we have  
ٌ“ وَرَقَةa sheet of paper.”

Nouns exhibit different endings according to their function in sentences. The 
majority of nouns have three cases (see Chapter 2 on nouns). Singular definite 
common nouns take three case endings: a Dhamma in the nominative case, a 
fat-Ha in the accusative, and a kasra in the genitive. The case marker is doubled 
in indefinite singular nouns in the orthography; in pronunciation such nouns 
are pronounced with an -n sound, called a tanwiin in Arabic terminology.
Dual nouns exhibit two endings for these three cases: the nominative  
is marked by ِ انand the accusative and genitive by ِ .يْنSimilarly, regular mas-
culine plural nouns exhibit two endings for the three cases: َون- in the nomina-
tive, and َين- in the accusative and genitive. Regular feminine plural nouns 
exhibit two endings: ٌات- in the nominative and ٍات- in the accusative and 
genitive.
Some nouns and adjectives are marked at their end with only one Dhamma 
in the orthography in the nominative case. In the accusative and genitive, they 
end with only one fat-Ha. A tanwiin, in other words, is not applied in the pro-
nunciation of such words, nor is it applied in their writing. Such nouns are 
said to be indeclinable nouns or diptotes. Arab grammarians use  الـمَمْنوعُ مِنَ الصرَّ ْ ف
for such nouns and adjectives. These nouns include most commonly the fol-
lowing, among others: (1) plural nouns of a certain pattern as presented below, 
(2) proper compound nouns, (3) comparative adjectives and color adjectives, 
both masculine and feminine, and (4) proper nouns of foreign origin as well 
as indigenous ones. The following examples illustrate the three cases of ُ مَدارِس
“schools” in the indefinite:
.ٌيف الـمَدينَةِ مَدارِسُ كَثريَةThere are many schools in the city.
.ًزُرْنا مَدارِسَ كثريَةWe visited many schools.
.ٍدَرَسوا يف مَدارِسَ كَثريَةThey studied in many schools.

Indeclinable nouns or adjectives exhibit a regular form when they are definite, 
however. Recall that nouns can be made definite either by:
1.
prefixing the definite article ;الـ
2.
attaching a possessive suffix; or
3.
using them in an IDhaafa-construct.
Examine the following sentences in which ُ مَدارِسis definite:
.ٌالـمَدارِسُ يف هذِهِ الـمَدينَةِ كَثريَةSchools in this city are numerous.
.َشاهَدْنا الـمَدارِسَ الكَ ثريَةWe saw the numerous schools.
.ِدَرَسوا يف الـمَدارِسِ الكَ ثريَةThey studied in the numerous schools.
.ِدَرَسوا يف مَدارِسِ احلُكومَةThey studied in the public schools.
Indeclinable nouns of the following patterns were listed in Chapter 28. We cite

The comparative adjective forms of the pattern ُ ,أَفْعَلas in ُ َر“ أَكْبbigger,”

are according to this pattern, as in َُرْم“ أَحred,” ُ“ أَزْرَقblue,” and so on. Such 
adjectives do not take a tanwiin in pronunciation, nor do they take two 
Dhammas in orthography.

The feminine form of the ُ أَفْعَلpattern is obtained according to the ُ فَعْالء

The grammar of numbers in Arabic is believed by some to be daunting. Many 
speakers of Arabic educated in the language commit errors in using the forms 
of numbers, both in speaking and in writing. Still, knowledge of some basic 
rules of the grammar of numbers is essential to learners of Arabic. In the 
following sections, we will introduce rules that will gradually guide the learner 
through these seemingly complex aspects of the language. The focus of the 
discussion here will be cardinal numbers—those numbers that are used to 
count objects or entities as in, for example, “three books” or “five women.” 
Ordinal numbers, i.e. numbers that indicate the order of objects or entities, 
such as “the fourth house,” will also be addressed in this chapter.
30.1 “One”  واحِ دand “Tw ” اِثْنان
The numbers “one” and “two” behave as adjectives in Arabic. In other words, 
“ واحِ دone” and “ اِثْنانtwo” must follow counted nouns in sentences and agree 
with them in gender and case. The number is referred to as ٌ“ عَدَدnumber,” and 
the counted noun is ٌ“ اِسْ م مَعْدودcounted noun.” Examine the examples related 
to  واحِ دbelow:
. ٌوَصَ لَ طالِبٌ واحِ دOne student (M) arrived.
.ٌوَصَ لَتْ طالِبَةٌ واحِ دَةOne student (F) arrived.
.ًشاهَدَ األُسْ تاذُ طالِباً واحِ داThe teacher saw one student (M).
.ٍَد مَعَ طالِبَةٍ واحِ دَةْمرَجَ عَ أَحAhmad returned with one student (F).
Note that in the first sentence ٌ واحِ دagrees with the preceding noun in gender 
(masculine) and also in case (nominative). Similarly, in the second sentence, 
ٌ واحِ دَةagrees with the feminine noun preceding it in both gender (feminine) 
and case (nominative).
CH PT R 30

373
In the third sentence, the noun ً طالِباis masculine and accusative due to its 
function as object of the verb َ .شاهَدThis explains why ً واحِ داis also both mas-
culine and accusative. On the other hand, the feminine noun ٍ طالِبَةin the fourth 
sentence is preceded by the preposition َ ,مَعwhich explains why it is in the 
genitive. Therefore, the number  واحِ دin this sentence must be both feminine 
and in the genitive case.
The behavior of ( اِثْنانM) and ِ( اِثْنَتانF) exactly mirrors the behavior of  واحِ د
in Arabic grammar, as explained above. ِ( اِثْنانM) becomes ِ اِثْـنَـيْـنin the  
accusative or genitive; and ِ( اِثْـنَـتـانF) becomes ِ اِثـْنَـتـَيـْنin the accusative or 
genitive. These forms are similar to the way dual nouns are derived from their 
singular counterparts. ( اِثْنانM) and ِ( اِثْنَتانF) must follow counted nouns and 
agree with them in gender and case. Examine the following examples and note 
the agreement of ِ اِثْنانor ِ( اِثْنَتانnominative) and their variants ِ اِثْـنَيْـنor ِ اِثـْنـَتـَيـْن
(accusative or genitive) with the nouns that precede them:
.ِرَجَ عَ طالِبانِ اِثْـنانTwo students (M) returned.
.ِشاهَدْنا طالِبَـيـْنِ اِثْنَـيْـنWe saw two students (M).
.ِرَجَ عوا مَعَ طالِبَيـْنِ اِثْنَـيْـنThey returned with two students (M).
.ِرَجَ عَت طالِبَتانِ اِثْنَتانTwo students (F) returned.
.ِشاهَدْتُّ طالِبَتـَيـْنِ اِثْنَتَـيْـنI saw two students (F).
.ِرَجَ عوا مَعَ طالِبَتَـيـْنِ اِثْنَتَيـْنThey returned with two students (F).
 واحِ دor ِ اِثْنانare used after nouns to emphasize and clarify the number of  
entities expressed in sentences. Their use can be redundant as the singular and 
dual forms of nouns already indicate number. However, the use of  اِثْنانafter 
the noun can help in avoiding confusion in differentiating between the dual 
and plural forms of nouns like “ بَلَدcountry,” as in ِ“ بَلَدانِ اِثْنانtwo countries” 
and “ بُلْدانmany countries.” The use of “ واحِ دone” helps in discerning one 
distinct thing as opposed to a simple indefinite noun, as in ٌ“ كِتابٌ واحِ دone 
book,” for example, versus ٌ“ كِتابa book.”

The numbers ٌ“ ثَالثَةthree,” ٌ“ أَرْبَعَةfour,” ٌْسَ ةَم“ خfive,” ٌ“ سِ تَّةsix,” ٌ“ سَ بْعَةseven,” 
ٌ“ ثَامنِيَةeight,” ٌ“ تِسْ عَةnine,” and ٌَةْر“ عَشten” precede and can also follow the 
counted nouns. The numbers themselves are subject to certain rules that we 
shall discuss below. The counted nouns following the numbers “ ثَالثَةthree” 
through َةْر“ عَشten” are also subject to certain grammatical requirements. We 
will first present the conditions put on the counted noun ( )االِسْ مُ الـمَعْدودthat 
occurs after the numbers “ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten.” It is important to 
note that there is a slight phonological change in the word َةْر“ عَشten.” When 
it is used before masculine nouns, it is pronounced َُةَر ;عَشbefore feminine nouns, 
it becomes ُ ْر.عَش
30.2.1 The counted noun from “three” to “ten” for  
indefinite nouns
1.
The counted noun ( )االِسْ مُ الـمَعْدودmust always be in the plural.
2.
It must always be in the genitive case as it is in the IDhaafa-construct.
3.
The counted noun must always be indefinite, thus ending with a tanwiin 
“nunation.”
The following examples illustrate the preceding grammatical requirements of 
the counted noun:
. ٍسافَرَ ثالثةُ طُ الّبThree students (M) traveled.
. ٍَ طالِباتْرشاهَدْنا عَشWe saw ten students (F).
.ٍمخْسَ ةِ رِجال َذَهَبَ مَعHe went with five men.
Now, we turn to examine the conditions put on the numbers from “ ثَالثَةthree” 
through َةْر“ عَشten.”
1.“ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten” vary in terms of case depending on their 
function in the sentence. In other words, “ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten” 
may be in the nominative (subject of a sentence), in the accusative (direct 
object of a transitive verb), or in the genitive (preceded by a preposition).

Numbers
375
2.
The numbers “ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten” vary in gender from the 
counted noun following them. If the singular form of the counted noun is 
masculine, the numbers “ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten” must be feminine. 
If the singular form of the counted noun is feminine, “ ثَالثَةthree” through 
َةْر“ عَشten” must be masculine. This is often referred to as gender polarity. 
In brief, the number is opposite in gender from the gender of the singular 
form of the counted noun.
Examine the following sentences:
. ٍسافَرَ ثَالثَةُ طُ الّبThree students (M) traveled.
Or, in the accusative (object of a verb), for example:
. ٍشاهَدْتُّ ثَالثَةَ طُ الّبI saw three students (M).
Or, in the genitive (preceded by a preposition), as in the following:
. ٍسافَرَ األُسْ تاذُ مَعَ ثَالثَةِ طُ الّبThe professor traveled with three  
students (M).
Note that “ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten” maintain the feminine marker when 
the singular form of the noun following these numbers is masculine. On the 
other hand, these numbers drop the feminine marker, the taa’ marbuuTa, when 
they are followed by feminine nouns, as in the following:
. ٍوَصَ لَ ثَالثُ طالِباتThree students (F) arrived.
. ٍْسَ سَ يّاراتَمشاهَدَ األُسْ تاذُ خThe professor saw five cars (F).
. ٍوَصَ لَ صَ ديقي مَعَ سَ بْعِ أَُستاذاتMy friend arrived with seven professors (F).
“ ثَامنِيَةeight,” when followed by a masculine noun, behaves in a regular fashion, 
as in the following:
. ٍرَجَ عَ ثَامنِيَةُ طُ الّبEight students (M) returned.

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
376
ٌ ثَامنِيَةexhibits a slightly different ending when followed by a feminine noun. It 
becomes  ثَامينin the nominative and genitive, as in the following examples:
.ثَامين طالِباتٍ رَجَ عْنَ أَمَسEight students (F) returned yesterday.
. ٍاألُستاذُ مَعَ ثَامين طالِباتThe professor is with eight students (F).
However, it becomes َ ِ ثَامنيin the accusative, as in the following example:
. ٍَ طالِباتِشاهَدَ ثَامنيHe saw eight students (F).
Arabic has a word specifically used when counting from three to nine (or ten, 
as some grammarians state), namely ُ“ بِضْ عseveral, some.” Like the numbers 
three to ten, ُ بِضْ عmust be followed by a plural noun in the genitive case and 
it differs in gender from the noun following it. For example, ُ بِضْ عremains 
in the masculine when it is followed by feminine, plural nouns, as in the  
following:
. ٍهَؤُالءِ بِضْ عُ طالِباتThese are several students (F).
.بِضْ عُ طَ بيباتٍ يَعْمَلْنَ يف هذا املُسْ تَشْ فىSeveral physicians (F) work in this 
hospital.
When ُ بِضْ عis followed by a masculine or a non-human plural noun, its gender 
changes into the feminine, as in the following:
. ٍهَؤُالءِ بِضْ عَةُ طُ الْبThese are several students (M).
. ٍهذِهِ بِضْ عَةُ كُتُبThese are several books.
. ٍقَرَأَ املُتَدَرِّبونَ بِضْ عَةَ مَقاالتThe trainees read several articles.
Additionally, ُ بِضْ عchanges case, depending on its function in the sentence as 
the examples below illustrate:
.َدَرَّسَ األُستاذُ بِضْ عَةَ طُ الّبٍ أَمْريكيّنيThe teacher taught several American 
students (M).
. ٍتَقابَلْنا مَعَ بِضْ عِ طالِباتٍ زائِراتWe met with several visiting students (F).

Thus far, we have presented examples where the numbers three to ten precede 
the counted noun and show disagreement in gender between the number word 
and the singular form of the counted noun. As has been stated earlier in this 
chapter, three to ten can also follow the counted noun. As in the previous 
examples, the number word must be opposite in gender to the singular form 
of the counted noun, as in the following examples:
. ُعادَت الـمُ وَظَّ فاتُ اخلَمْسThe five employees (F, Pl) returned.
.ُعادَ الـمُ وَظَّ فونَ اخلَمْسَ ةThe five employees (M, Pl) returned.
Recall that non-human plural nouns are always treated as feminine singular, 
regardless of the gender of those nouns in the singular. For example,  كِتابin 
the singular is masculine whereas its plural form  كُتُبis treated as feminine 
singular. ٌ ,وَثيقةthe feminine singular noun, and its plural form  وَثائِقare 
both treated in the same way with respect to gender. Examine the following 
examples:
. َقَرَأْنا الوَثائِقَ األرْبَعWe read the four documents.
. ٍَيْنا ثَالثَةَ كُتُبَراِشْ تWe bought three books.
.َْسَ ةَ عَصافريَمشاهَدْنا خWe saw five birds.
Cardinal numbers from three to ten function as adjectives when placed after 
the counted nouns. The rule of opposites in gender must apply. The number 
and the nouns they modify must be identical in case. Examine the following 
pairs of sentences in the nominative, accusative and genitive, respectively:
.ُرَجَ عَ الطُّ الّبُ اخلَمْسَ ةThe five (F) students (M) returned.
. ُرَجَ عَتِ الطّ الِباتُ اخلَمْسThe five (M) students (F) returned.
.َشاهَدْنا الـمُ عَلّمنيَ الثَّالثَةWe saw the three teachers.
. َشاهَدْنا الـمُ عَلِّامتِ الثَّالثWe saw the three teachers (F).

30.4 “ leven” and “Twelve” َ َرَ وَاثْنا عَشَرأَحَ دَ عَش
The number َ َر“ أَحَ دَ  عَشeleven” is used before masculine nouns. Its variant  
ََةْر إِحْ دَى عَشis used before feminine nouns. These numbers are invariable with 
respect to case. Both of their components always end with a fat-Ha. The counted 
nouns ( )االِسْ مُ الـمَعْدودfollowing these numbers are always (1) singular, (2) in
definite, and (3) accusative, as in the following examples:
.ًَ طالِباَروَصَ لَ أَحَ دَ عَشEleven students (M) arrived.
.ًَةَ طالِبَةْروَصَ لَت إحْ دى عَشEleven students (F) arrived.
Similarly, the number َ َر“ اِثْنا  عَشtwelve” is used with masculine nouns.  
Its feminine counterpart ََةْر اثْنتا عَشis used with feminine nouns. These forms  
َ َر اِثنا عَشand ةْر اِثْنَتا عَشare used in the nominative case. Examine the following:
.ًَ طالِباَروَصَ لَ اِثْنا عَشTwelve students (M) arrived.
.ًَةَ طالِبَةْروَصَ لَتِ اِثْنَتا عَشTwelve students (F) arrived.

The numbers َ َرَةَ / ثَالثَةَ عَشْر“ ثَالثَ عَشthirteen” through َ َرَةَ / تِسْ عَةَ عَشْر تِسْ عَ عَش
“nineteen,” like َ َر“ أَحَ دَ  عَشeleven” and َ َر“ اثنا  عَشtwelve,” must be followed  
by singular, indefinite, and accusative nouns. Additionally, these numbers  
are always invariable with respect to their endings, which is always a fat-Ha  
on both parts. However, the first element of these numbers is always in the 
gender opposite to that of the counted noun. If the gender of the singular form 
of the counted noun is masculine, the first component of “thirteen through 
nineteen” is feminine, and vice versa. This condition is similar to what was 
mentioned previously about the numbers “ ثَالثَةthree” through َةْر“ عَشten,” i.e., 
the gender polarity discussed earlier. However, the second term of the number, 
namely َ َر“ عَشten,” has the same gender as the counted noun. Examine the 
following:
.ًَ طالِباَروَصَ لَ ثَالثَةَ عَشThirteen students (M) arrived.
.ًَةَ سَ يّارَةْرشاهَدْنا تِسْ عَ عَشWe saw nineteen cars.
.ًَةَ طالِبَةْرْسَ عَشَموَصَ لَتْ مَعَ خShe arrived with fifteen students (F).
With definite nouns, gender polarity applies; both terms of the numbers are in 
the accusative. The nouns in the preceding examples are changed into the 
definite plural to illustrate the use of numbers with definite nouns:
.َ َروَصَ لَ الطُّ الّبُ الثَّالثَةَ عَشThe thirteen students arrived.
.ََةْرشاهَدْنا السَّ يّاراتِ التِّسْ عَ عَشWe saw the nineteen cars.

30.6 T e Tens (“Twen y,” “T i

.) ِأَلفاظُ العُقود
The number “twenty” is formed from the word َةْر“ عَشten” by omitting the taa’ 
marbuuTa  ةand attaching the regular masculine plural nominative suffix َون-. 
Note that the vowel following the first consonant changes from a fat-Ha in َةْر عَش
to a kasra in ونْر.عِش

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar

“Thirty” through “ninety” are formed by dropping the taa’ marbuuTa  ةat 
the end of the cardinal numbers “three” through “nine” and attaching َون-, 
thus resulting in the following numbers:
َثَالثونthirty
َسَ بْعونseventy
َأَرْبَعونforty
َثَامنونeighty
َْسونَمخfifty
َتِسْ عونninety
َسِ تّونsixty
َونْر“ عِشtwenty” through َ“ تِسْ عونninety” are invariable with respect to the 
gender of the nouns following them. However, they change with respect to 
case. Note that the counted noun following these numbers must be singular 
and accusative. Examine the following:
.ًسافَرَ ثَالثونَ مُعِلِّامThirty teachers (M) traveled.
.ًسافَرَت ثَالثونَ مُعَلِّمَةThirty teachers (F) traveled.
The regular masculine plural suffix َ ـونchanges to َين- in the accusative and 
in the genitive case. This is similar to the behavior of regular plural nouns. 
Examine the following:
.ًْسنيَ طالِباَمشاهَدْنا خWe saw fifty students (M).”
.ًْسنيَ طالِبةَمرَجَ عَ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ مَعَ خThe teachers (M) returned 
with fifty students (F).

« َونَ إِىل «تِسْ عٌ وَتِسْ عونْرواحِ دٌ وعِش
“Twenty-one” through “twenty-nine” are formed by conjoining the cardinal 
number “ واحِ دone” through “ تِسْ عَةnine” with the word َونْر ,عِشusing the 
conjunctive particle َ ,وas in the following masculine forms:

Numbers
381
َونْرواحِ دٌ وعِشtwenty-one
َونْراِثنانِ وعِشtwenty-two
َونْرثالثَةٌ وعِشtwenty-three
etc.
The same rule applies to the other tens, as in the following illustrative 
examples:
َْسَ ةٌ وسَ بْعونَمخseventy-five
َتِسْ عَةٌ وتِسْ عونninety-nine
and so on.
Recall that the number “ واحِ دone” and its feminine form ٌ واحِ دَةor  ,اِحْ دَى
and ِ“ اِثْنانtwo” and its feminine form ِ اِثْـنَتـانin the nominative or ِ اِثْـنَـتَـيـْنin 
the accusative or genitive, agree with the counted noun in gender. Examine the 
following examples:
.ًونَ مُديراْرسافَرَ واحِ دٌ وعِشTwenty-one directors (M) traveled.
.ًونَ مُديرَةْرسافَرَتْ إِحدَى وعِشTwenty-one directors (F) traveled.

.ًونَ مُديرَةْرسافَرَتْ اِثْنَتانِ وعِشTwenty-one directors (F) traveled.
On the other hand, the cardinal numbers “ ثَالثَةthree” through “ تِسْ عَةnine” 
must be the opposite in gender from the counted nouns. This gender polarity 
requires that the counted noun be in the gender opposite to that of the number. 
Examine the following examples:
.ًسونَ طالِباَمسافَرَ تِسْ عَةٌ وخFifty-nine students (M) traveled.
.ًْسونَ طالِبَةَمسافَرَتْ تِسْ عٌ وخFifty-nine students (F) traveled.

30.8 Hund ed(s) ٌمِئَة / مِئات
“ مِئَةٌhundred,” pronounced as mi’at-un as the orthographic components  
indicate, is also written less commonly with an ’alif as ٌ .ماءَةRegardless  
of which spelling one adopts, ٌ مِئَةis invariable with respect to the gender of 
the noun following it. The case marker of ٌ مِئَةchanges, however, depending 
on its function in the sentence. In other words, it can be in the nominative, 
accusative or genitive case. The counted noun following ٌ مِئَةmust be singular, 
indefinite and genitive, thus forming an IDhaafa-construct, as in the following 
examples:
. ٍوَصَ لَ مِئَةُ طالِب
A hundred students (M) arrived.
.ٍدَرَّسَ الـمُ ـعَلِّمُ مِئَةَ طالِبَة
The teacher (M) taught a hundred students (F).
. ٍسافَرَ الـمُ ـعَلِّمُ مَعَ مِئَةِ طالِب
The teacher (M) traveled with a hundred students (M).
30.8.1 “Two hundred” ِمِئَتان
 مِئَةٌtakes on a dual form by attaching the nominative masculine dual suffix ِان-. 
The addition of the dual suffix results in the writing of the taa’ marbuuTa as a 
regular taa’, resulting in ِ .مِئَتانThis nominative form has accusative and genitive 

Numbers
383
counterparts, as in ِ .مِئَتـَيـْنThe counted noun following ِ مِئَتـَيـْنis always  
singular, indefinite, and genitive, thus forming an IDhaafa-construct, just like 
ٌ مِئَةabove. If ِ مِئَتانis the head noun in the IDhaafa-construct, its final nuun must 
be dropped, as in all dual and plural nouns ending with nuun, when forming 
a part of IDhaafa. Examine the following examples:
. ٍوَصَ لَ مِئَتا طالِبTwo hundred students (M) arrived.
.ٍقَرَأْنا مِئَتَيْ مَقالَةWe read two hundred articles.
. ٍِيَسْ كُ نُ الطُّ البُ يف مِئَتَىْ بَيْتThe students live in two hundred houses.
“Three hundred” through “nine hundred” are expressed by the intended  
cardinal number, which is always in the masculine, followed by the noun  مِئَة
in the singular and genitive. This formation amounts to an IDhaafa-construct 
in which the second noun is indefinite, genitive and singular. This structure  
is represented in two ways in the orthography (as we see in the list below); 
both orthographic representations are equally acceptable. The dropping of the 
’alif, however, is more common:
ٍ ثَالثُامئةor ٍ ثَالثُمِئَةthree hundred
ٍ أَرْبَعُامئةor ٍ أَرْبَعُمِئَةfour hundred
ٍْسُ امئةَم خor ٍْسُ مِئَةَمخfive hundred
ٍ سِ تُّامئةor ٍسِ تُّمِئَةsix hundred

ٍ ثَامنُامئةor ٍثَامنُمِئَةeight hundred
ٍ تِسْ عُامئةor ٍتِسْ عُمِئَةnine hundred
Recall that the first term of IDhaafa varies in case depending on its function. 
When the second term in this IDhaafa-construct, namely  ,مِئَةis followed by 
another noun in an expanded IDhaafa-construct,  مِئَةloses its tanwiin. Examine 
the following examples:

The director (F) went with three hundred students (M).
30.9 T
usand(s) ٌأَلْفٌ / آالف
“ أَلْفٌone thousand” always assumes the masculine form. However, its case can 
vary depending on its function in the sentence. The counted noun following 
ٌ“ أَلْفthousand” must be singular, genitive and indefinite. In other words,  
 أَلْفforms an IDhaafa-construct. Examine the following examples:
. ٍوَصَ لَ أَلْفُ طالِبA thousand students (M) arrived.
.ٍوَصَ لَت أَلْفُ طالِبَةA thousand students (F) arrived.
. ٍعَلَّمَت األُسْ تاذَةُ أَلفَ طالِبThe teacher (F) taught a thousand students.
.ٍيَسْ كُ نُ الطُّ الّبُ يف أَلفِ غُ رْفَةThe students live in a thousand rooms.
30.9.1 “Two thousand” ِأَلفان
“ أَلْفٌone thousand” has a dual form generated by attaching the nominative 
masculine dual suffix ِ ,انas in ِ ;أَلفانand by attaching the accusative and genitive 
form ِ ,يـْنas in ِ .أَلفَيْـنThe counted noun following the dual form ِ أَلفانor ِ أَلفَيْـن
is always singular, indefinite and genitive. ِ أَلفانor ِ ألفَيـْنthus form an IDhaafa-
construct, causing the nuun to drop, as in the following:
. ٍوَصَ لَ أَلْفا طالِبTwo thousand students (M) arrived.
.ٍوَصَ لَت ألْفا طالِبَةTwo thousand students (F) arrived.
. ٍعَلَّمَتِ األُسْ تاذَةُ أَلْفَيْ طالِبThe teacher (F) taught two thousand students.

30.9.2 Thousands and dates ٌ آالفor ٌأُلوف
“Three thousand” through “ten thousand” are expressed by the intended car-
dinal number, which is always in the feminine, followed by the noun  آالفin 
the plural. This formation amounts to an IDhaafa-construct in which the second 
noun is plural, indefinite, and genitive, as in the following:
ٍثَالثَةُ آالفthree thousand
ٍسَ بْعَةُ آالفseven thousand
ٍأَرْبَعَةُ آالفfour thousand
ٍثَامنِيَةُ آالفeight thousand
ٍْسَ ةُ آالفَمخfive thousand
ٍتِسْ عَةُ آالفnine thousand
ٍسِ تَّةُ آالفsix thousand
ٍَةُ آالفْرعَشten thousand
The first term of IDhaafa varies in case depending on its function. When the 
second term in this IDhaafa-construct, namely  ,آالفis followed by another noun 
in an expanded IDhaafa-construct, the word  آالفloses its tanwiin. Examine 
the following examples:
. ٍوَصَ لَ ثَالثَةُ آالفِ طالِب
Three thousand students (M) arrived.
.ٍعَلَّمَت األُسْ تاذَةُ سَ بْعَةَ آالفِ طالِبَة
The teacher (F) taught seven thousand students (F).
. ٍْسَ ةِ آالفِ بَيْتَمتَسْ كُ نُ العائِالتُ يف خ
The families live in five thousand houses.
The word ٌ أَلْفis very handy in reading dates in formal spoken or written 
Arabic. Thus, reading a date begins with the mention of the word for year  
as the first item of the IDhaafa-construct, followed by the word ٌ“ أَلفthousand” 
in the genitive case (or its dual for the present calendar), then the hundreds  
of years, then any other number of years. For example, the year 1967 is read 
as follows:
َيف سَ نَةِ أَلْفٍ وتِسْ عِامئَةٍ وسَ بْعٍ وسِ تّني
in the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
386
Note that the word  سَ بْعin the preceding date is in the masculine, opposite in 
gender to the feminine word “ سَ نَةyear.”
The phrase ِ“ يف سَ نَةin the year of” in the preceding example can be replaced 
by another equivalent phrase to mean the same thing, namely ِ“ يف عامin the 
year of.” Because “ عامyear” is masculine,  سَ بْعin the preceding date must be 
used in the feminine. The above date can be read in the following way:
َيف عامِ أَلْفٍ وتِسْ عِمِئَةٍ وسَ بَعَةٍ وَسِ تّني
in the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven
We should mention that ٌ أُلوفis another plural form for ٌ .أَلْفThis plural form 
is restricted in use: it is not used with cardinal numbers as ٌ آالفis. In addition, 
it is generally followed by the preposition “ مِنfrom,” as in ِ أُلوفٌ مِن الطُّ الّب
“thousands of students,” to express a large unspecified number of entities.
30.10 
illi n(s) مِلْيونٌ / مَاليي
The word ٌ“ مِليونmillion,” borrowed from a western European language, has 
as its plural form ُ“ مَالينيmillions.” This plural form is always masculine. 
However, the plural form varies in case, as in the following examples:
. ِتَظاهَرَ مَالينيُ األَشْ خاصMillions of people demonstrated.
. ِشاهَدْنا مَالينيَ األشْ خاصWe saw millions of people.
. ِاِسْ تَمَعْنا إِىل مَالينيِ األشْ خاصWe listened to millions of people.
 مِلْيونis used as a first noun in the IDhaafa-construct, thus making the noun 
that follows it genitive, singular, and indefinite, as in the following:
.تَظاهَرَ مِلْيونُ عامِلٍ يف شَ وارِعِ القاهِرَة
A million workers demonstrated in the streets of Cairo.
Like, ٌ“ أَلْفthree million” through “ten million” are expressed by the intended 
cardinal number, which is always in the feminine, followed by the noun  مَاليني
in the plural. This formation amounts to an IDhaafa-construct. Examine the 

Numbers

following:
ثَالثَةُ مَالينيthree millionسَ بْعَةُ مَالينيseven million
أَرْبَعَةُ مَالينيfour millionثَامنِيَةُ مَالينيeight million
ْسَ ةُ مَالينيَمخfive millionتِسْ عَةُ مَالينيnine million
سِ تَّةُ مَالينيsix millionَةُ مَالينيَرعَشten million
The numbers ٌ“ ثَالثَةthree” through ٌَةْر“ عَشten” before “ مَالينيmillions” are 
always in the feminine. In other words, since the singular for  مَالينيis the 
masculine  مِلْيونor “ مَلْيونmillion,” the gender polarity rule applies. The counted 
noun after such numbers is always in the singular and genitive, forming a part 
of IDhaafa, as in the following:
. ٍيف مَكْ تَبَةِ اجلامِعَةِ ثَالثَةُ مَالينيِ كِتاب
There are three million books in the university library.
.ٍيف الـمَكْ تَبَةِ ثَالثَةُ مَالينيِ وَثيقَة
There are three million documents in the library.
Instead of IDhaafa, the use of ْ مِنplus the noun can express the same meaning. 
The above sentences can be expressed by the following:
. ِيف مَكْ تَبَةِ اجلامِعَةِ ثَالثَةُ مَالينيَ مِنَ الكُ تُب
There are three million books in the university library.
.ِيف املَكْ تَبَةِ ثَالثَةُ مَالينيَ مِنَ الوَثائِق
There are three million documents in the library.
The number “ مِلْيارbillion” has been introduced in Arabic, a borrowing from 
French. Occasionally, one hears the English “ بِلْيونbillion” as a synonym, from 
individuals trained in the English-speaking world and in the United Nations’ 
New York Headquarters.

(َةْرتيبِيَّةُ لألَعْدادِ مِنْ واحِ د إِىل عَشَّراَألعْدادُ الت )
 أَوَّلis the ordinal number of  واحِ دin the masculine. The feminine form is  .أُوىل
Note that the ordinal number for “ واحِ دone” is phonetically dissimilar to the 
consonants that comprise  .أَوَّلThis is not surprising in comparison with several 
languages. The cardinal numbers are different from the ordinals in many west-
ern European languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian, among 
many others. Consider, for example, the English “one” and “first,” and “two” 
and “second.” Ordinal numbers function as adjectives. They follow the nouns 
they modify and agree with them in gender, case, and determination (definite/
indefinite). Examine the following sentences:
. ُجورج واشِ نْطُ ن هُ وَ الرَّئيسُ األَوَّلGeorge Washington is the first president.
. َجورْج واشِ نْطُ ن كانَ الرَّئيسَ األَوَّلGeorge Washington was the first president.
.هذِهِ اجلامِعَةُ هِيَ اجلامِعَةُ األُوىلThis university is the first university.
. َقَرَأْتُ الكِتابَ األَوَّلI read the first book.
.قَرَأْتُ اجلَريدَةَ األُوىلI read the first newspaper.
 األُوىلis invariable with respect to its case. Moreover,  األُوىلis not used to tell 
time in the same way as the other ordinal numbers (الثّاين والثّالِث، والرّابِع ) are 
used. For example, in time-telling in formal spoken or written Arabic, ُ السّ اعة
“ الثّانِيةtwo o’clock,” “ السّ اعَةُ الثالِثَةthree o’clock,” etc. are used. However, for 
“one o’clock,” only  السّ اعةُ الواحِ دةis used.
Ordinal numbers for “ اِثنانtwo” to َةَر“ عَشten” are derived according to the 
pattern  .فاعِلFor instance from “ ثَالثَةthree” we obtain  ;ثالِثfrom “ سَ بعَةseven” 
we obtain  سابِعand so on. The numbers “ اِثنانtwo” and ة
َّ
“ سِتsix” present interest
ing phonetic forms. From  اثْنانwe obtain ٍ .ثانHowever, when ٍ ثانis made definite 
or feminine, a yaa’ is retrieved, thus we obtain ( الثّاينM) and ( الثانيةF), respectively.
On the other hand, the number  سِ تَّةshould yield  ساتِتaccording to the 
 فاعِلpattern, a word that is not used in the language. Because of phonetic 
processes, or the original root of this number in the language, we obtain  سادِس
instead. A table illustrating cardinal and ordinal numbers is provided at the 
end of this section.

Numbers
389
The ordinal numbers generated by the  فاعِلpattern are used as adjectives, 
with all the conditions required of noun–adjective phrases. The examples below 
are illustrative:
. ُتوماس جَ فَرْسون هُ وَ الرَّئيسُ الثّالِثThomas Jefferson is the third president.
. َشاهَدْنا الفِلْمَ اخلامِسWe saw the fifth movie.
.ُالسَّ يِّدَةُ سوزان هِيَ األُسْ تاذَةُ الرّابِعَةSusan is the fourth professor.
.ِتَكَ لَّمَ الطالّبُ مَعَ األُسْ تاذَةِ السّ ادِسَ ةThe students spoke with the sixth teacher.
In addition, ordinal numbers are used in reading dates in formal spoken or 
written Arabic. For example, in reading the date “sixth of April,” for example, 
the following is used:
.أبريل عامَ ألْفٍ وتِسْ عِامئةٍ وتِسْ عني يف السادِسِ مِنْ شَ هْرِ نيسان
Or
.أبريل عامَ أَلْفٍ وتِسْ عِمئِةٍ وتِسْ عني يف اليَوْمِ السّ ادِس مِنْ شَ هْرِ نيسان
30.12 O dinal numbe s as

The ordinal numbers generated by  فاعِلcan also be used as adverbs. In this case, 
the ordinal number forms must be in the accusative and written with a tanwiin. 
Recall that adverbs are used to modify verbs, as in the following examples:
.ًقَرَأْتُ الكِتابَ أَوَّالI read the book first.
These adverbial forms of the ordinal numbers, i.e. ً ,أَوَّالً / ثانِياً / ثالِثاcan be used 
to enumerate a list of actions performed. Examine the following discourse:
كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُ القَهْوةَ العَرَبِيَّةَ؟
How do you make Arabic coffee?

With the exception of “ نِصْ فhalf,” fractions are formed according to the ٌ فُعْل
pattern for the numbers three to ten. Thus, from ٌ“ ثَالثَةthree” we obtain ٌ“ ثُلْثone 
third,” from ٌ“ أَرْبَعَةfour,” ٌ“ رُبْعone quarter,” and so on. ٌ“ سِ تَّةsix” presents an 
interesting case. According to the ٌ فُعْلpattern we obtain ٌّ ,سُ تwhich is not a 
true word in the language. As a result of some phonetic processes, mainly 
voicing and forward assimilation, the real word for one sixth is ٌ.سُ دْس
These fractions are treated as nouns in Arabic. They can be definite or 
indefinite, can be changed into the dual and plural, they can change their case 
endings according to their functions in sentences, etc. Thus, we obtain ِ نِصْ فان
“two halves,” ٌ“ أَنْصافhalves,” ِ“ سُ دْسانtwo sixths,” ٌ“ أَسْ داسsixths,” etc. As 
nouns, these fractions can be counted by the use of the cardinal numbers, 
forming an IDhaafa-construct. Thus, we obtain, for example, ٍ“ ثَالثَةُ أرْباعthree 
quarters,” ٍ“ أَرْبَعَةُ أَعشارfour tenths,” etc. It is interesting to note that the plurals 
of two fractions in particular, namely ٌاسْم“ أَخfifths” and ٌ“ أَسْ داسsixths” com-
bine to form the commonly used saying ٍاساً يف أَسْ داسْمَ بَ أَخَر“ ضto be at one’s 
wits’ end,” to express a state when a person racks his or her brain to find a

solution to a dilemma encountered. We should note that the tense of the verb 
ََ بَر“ ضto multiply,” can be heard in the present tense.
Fractions are frequently used in statistical literature, in pricing items, and 
also in time telling. The fractions “ نِصْ فhalf,” “ ثُلْثthird,” and “ رُبْعquarter” 
are frequently used in these cases.
In pricing items, the question word “ بِكَ مhow much” is followed by the 
item to be purchased, or the weight unit used, as in the following:
بِكَ م هذا القَميصُ ؟How much is this shirt?
.ٍَةِ دَنانريَ ورُبْعْرهذا القَميصُ بِعَشThis shirt is (for) ten dinars and a quarter.
بِكَ م كيلو التُّفاح؟How much are the apples (by kilogram)?
. ٍ الكيلو بِدينارٍ ونِصْ فA dinar and a half for the kilo.
In asking the time, the question word “ كَمhow much?, how many?,” is used 
followed by the word for hour or time, as in the following:
كَم السّ اعَةُ؟What time is it?
.السّ اعَةُ اآلنَ الواحِ دَةُ والثُّلْثIt is now one o’clock and twenty.  
(lit. “one o’clock and a third”)
كَم الوَقْتُ اآلنَ ؟What is the time now?
.ًالسّ اعَةُ اآلنَ اخلامِسَ ةُ إالّ رُبْعاIt is quarter to five now. (lit. “five except/
minus a quarter”)
Furthermore, these fractions also become verbs according to the َ( فَعَّلForm II) 
pattern. We obtain ََّسَم“ خto increase fivefold,” َ“ سَ بَّعto increase sevenfold,” etc. 
From such verbs, “ اِسْ م فاعِلactive participle,” “ اِسْ م مَفْعولpassive participle,” 
and “ مَصْ دَرverbal nouns” can be derived. For example, from ََّسَم“ خto increase 
fivefold” we can derive ٌَمِّسُخ“ مone who increases something fivefold,” ٌَمَّسُخ م
“something that is turned into five parts,” and ٌْميسَخ“ تthe act of increasing 
something fivefold.”

Quantifiers are words that express how much of an entity or group is under dis­
cussion, for example, َّ“ كُلall,” “ بَعْضsome,” يعَم“ جall,” “ مُعْظَ مmost,”  عِدَّةٌ مِن
“a number of.” Quantifiers function mainly as nouns in Arabic and are used 
as determiners of other nouns in IDhaafa-constructs. Quantifiers can add  
emphasis to a statement. For discussion of emphasis see Chapter 38. Each of 
these quantifiers is discussed in some detail below.
31.1 ّكُل
31.1.1 ّ كُلplus indefinite singular nouns:  
“each and every”
ّ كُلcan be followed by indefinite, singular nouns, forming an IDhaafa construct. 
In this case, ّ كُلmeans “each and every.” ّ كُلcase varies depending on its func­
tion in the sentence, as the following examples illustrate:
. ٍوَصَ لَ كُلُّ طالِبEach and every student (M) arrived.
.ٍوَصَ لَت كُلُّ طالِبَةEach and every student (F) arrived.
. ٍشاهَدَ األُسْ تاذُ كُلَّ طالِبThe teacher (M) saw each and every student (M).
. ٍسافَرَ األُسْ تاذُ مَعَ كُلِّ طالِبThe teacher (M) traveled with each and every  
student.
31.1.2 ّ كُلplus definite singular nouns: “the whole of”
In addition, ّ كُلcan be followed by a definite singular noun to mean “the whole 
of, all of.” This applies only to nouns that are divisible and broken into parts.

Quantifiers  
ٌيع، مُعْظَ م، كِال، كِلْتا، عِدَّةَمكُلّ ، بَعْض، ج

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar

The noun following ّ كُلmust be in the genitive case, forming an IDhaafa  
construct. Examine the examples below:
. ِ هذا هُ وَ كُلُّ الكِتابThis is the whole book.
.ِ هذِهِ هِيَ كُلُّ املَقالَةThis is the whole essay.
. ِقَرَأْتُ كُلَّ الكِتابI read the whole book.
. ِهذا السُّ ؤالُ يف كُلِّ الكِتابThis question is in the whole book.
Note that nouns like ٌ كِتابand ٌ ,خُ بْزunlike nouns like ٌ طالِبand ٌ ,أَُستاذcan be 
divided into portions or parts. In other words, the following asterisked sentences, 
while technically grammatically correct, are semantically odd:
. ِ**شاهَدَ كُلَّ الطّ الِبHe saw the whole student.
.ِ**وَصَ لَ مَعَ كُلِّ األُستاذHe arrived with the whole teacher.
31.1.3 ّ كُلplus definite plural nouns: “all of”
ّ كُلcan also be followed by definite plural nouns to mean “all of,” forming an 
IDhaafa-construct. The case marker of ّ كُلvaries depending on its function in 
the sentence, as the following sentences illustrate:
. ِوَصَ لَ كُلُّ الطُّ الّبAll the students arrived.
. ِهَؤُالءِ كُلُّ الطُّ الّبThese are all the students.
. ِشاهَدْنا كُلَّ الطُّ الّبWe saw all the students.
. ِوَصَ لَ سامي مَعَ كُلِّ الطُّ الّبSami arrived with all the students.
31.2 “ بَعْضsom  of”
Like ٌّ ,كُلthe noun “ بَعْضsome” can form an IDhaafa construct. Its case can 
also vary, depending on its function in the sentence. Examine the following 
examples:

Quantifiers
395
. ِهذا بَعْضُ األَكْلThis is some of the food.
. ِأَكَلْتُ بَعْضَ األكْلI ate some of the food.
. ِالبَطاطا يف بَعْضِ األكْلThere are potatoes in some of the food.
 بَعْضcan be followed by plural nouns, forming an IDhaafa construct, as in the 
following:
. ِهَؤُالءِ بَعْضُ الطُّ الّبThese are some of the students.
. ِشاهَدَ الـمُ ديرُ بَعْضَ الطُّ الّبThe director (M) saw some of the students.
. ِوَصَ لَ الـمُ ديرُ مَعَ بَعْضِ الطُّ الّبThe director (M) arrived with some of  
the students.
31.3 يعَم“ جll of”
يعَم“ جall of” must be followed by a plural noun. This quantifier functions as 
the first term of an IDhaafa construct. Its case also varies depending on its 
function in the sentence, as in the examples below:
. ِيعُ الطُّ الّبَمهؤُالءِ جThese are all of the students.
. ِيعَ الطُّ الّبَمشاهَدَ األُسْ تاذُ جThe professor (M) saw all the students.
. ِيعِ الطُّ الّبَموَصَ لَ الـمُ ديرُ مَعَ جThe director (M) arrived with all  
the students.
31.4 “ مُعْظَ مmos  of”
“ مُعْظَ مmost of” can be followed by a divisible noun, such as ٌ كِتابor ٌ .أَكْلLike 
the preceding quantifiers, it forms IDhaafa constructs; its case can vary, depend­
ing on its function in the sentence, as in the following examples:
. ِهذا مُعْظَ مُ األَكْلThis is most of the food.
. ِأَكَلوا مُعْظَ مَ األَكْلThey ate most of the food.
.اَلبَطاطا يف مُعْظَ مِ األَكْلPotatoes are in most foods.

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
396
As  مُعْظَ مhas the meaning of “most of,” this logically implies a larger group of 
entities and, therefore, can be followed by plural nouns, as in the following 
examples:
. ِهَؤُالءِ مُعْظَ مُ الطُّ الّبThese are most of the students.
. ِشاهَدْنا مُعظَ مَ الطُّ الّبWe saw most of the students.
. ِسافروا مَعَ مُعْظَ مِ الطُّ الّبThey traveled with most of the 
students.
31.5 “ كِالbo
”
 كِالis used with dual masculine nouns. It remains invariable when it precedes 
nouns and forms an IDhaafa construct, as in the following examples:
.ِوَصَ لَ كِال الـمُ وَظَّ فَيـْنThe two employees [both] arrived.
.ِشاهَدْنا كِال الفِلـميـْنWe saw [both of] the two films.
 كِالcan also follow the noun. In this case, it adds affirmation or emphasis. It 
also agrees with the noun preceding it in case. The dual suffix pronoun اُم ه
must attach to  .كِالExamine the following:
.اُموَصَ لَ الـمُ وَظَّ فانِ كِالهBoth of the two employees arrived.
.شاهَدْنا الفِلْمَـيْـنِ كِلَـيْـهِامWe saw both of the two films.
هَلْ هذا النَّصُّ يف الكِتابَيْـنِ كِـلَـيْـهِام؟Is this text in both of the two books?
31.6 “ كِلْتاbo
”
 كِلْتاis used with dual feminine nouns, and behaves in the same way as  .كِال
When it precedes the noun,  كِلْتاremains invariable and forms an IDhaafa
construct, as in the following:
.ِوَصَ لَتْ كِلْتا البِنْتَـيـْنBoth girls arrived.
.ِشاهَدْنا كِلتا السَّ يّارَتَـيـْنWe saw both cars.

Quantifiers
397
When  كِلتاfollows the noun, it must agree with the feminine noun in case. 
Examine the following:
.اُموَصَ لَتِ البِنْتانِ كِلتاهBoth girls arrived.
.شاهَدْنا السَّ يّارَتَـيْـنِ كِلْتَيْهِامWe saw both cars.
.هذِهِ األَخبارُ يف اجلَريدَتَـيْـنِ كِلتَيْهِامThis news is in both papers.
31.7 ٌ“ عِدَّةm ny, 
 numb
 of”
ٌ عِدَّةis used with plural indefinite nouns, both masculine and feminine. It func­
tions as the first noun in an IDhaafa construct. Its case can vary depending on 
its function in the sentence. Examine the following examples:
.ََ االِجْ تِامعَ عِدَّةُ مُوَظَّ فنيَرحَ ض
A number of employees attended the meeting.
.ٍقابَلَ صَ ديقي عِدَّةَ زُوّار

The quantifiers introduced in this chapter can be used as adjectives, i.e., they 
follow nouns to add emphasis. However, two conditions must be met: (1) The 
quantifiers must be followed by suffixal pronouns identical in number and 
gender to the nouns they modify; and (2) the quantifiers must agree with the 
preceding nouns in case, as in the examples below:
.ُ قَرَأْنا الكِتابَ كُلَّهWe read the book, all of it.
.شاهَدْنا األَفْالمَ كُلَّهاWe saw the movies, all of them.
.يعُهُمَم رَجَ عَ الطُّ الّبُ جAll of the students (M) returned.
. َّيعِهِنَمتَقابَلَتِ األُستاذَةُ مَعَ الطّ الِباتِ جThe professor (F) met with all of 
the students (F).

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
398
This construction is known as apposition (see Chapter 37). The preceding sen­
tences, in which يعَم جand ّ كُلare used as adjectives, are equivalent in meaning 
to the following sentences, where يعَم جand  كُلform a part of the IDhaafa-
construct:
. ِقَرَأْنا كُلَّ الكِتابWe read the whole book.
.ِشاهَدْنا كُلَّ األَفالمWe saw all of the films.
. ِيعُ الطُّ البَمرَجَ عَ جAll of the students returned.
. ِيعِ الطّ الِباتَمتَقابَلَتِ األُستاذَةُ مَعَ جThe professor (F) met with all of  
the students (F), all of them.
The difference between these structures is only a stylistic variation.

 ,احلالa “circumstantial clause,” provides information about the circumstance 
or condition of the action expressed in the main verb of the sentence. This 
structure answers the question of “how” the event took place. There are often 
two events happening simultaneously, the main event expressed in the main 
clause, and another, subordinate clause, that describes the circumstance under 
which this action takes or took place.  حالclauses can be expressed in the fol-
lowing five ways:
32.1 A Nomi

A nominal sentence must be conjoined to the main clause by a waaw referred 
to as Haal-waaw,  .واو  احلالThis Haal-sentence must have as its head an  
independent pronoun that refers to the subject of the verb in the main  
clause. The tense of the verb in the main clause can vary. The verb in the 
subordinate clause is usually in the present tense, as in the following sentences 
in the singular:
. َوَصَ لتِ الطّ الِبَةُ وَهِيَ تـَحْ مِلُ الكُ تُب
The student (F) arrived [while she was] carrying the books.
. ُتَرَكَ صَ ديقي البَيْتَ وَهُ وَ يَضْ حَ ك

This structure amounts to two verbal sentences conjoined without the presence 
of  واو احلالand without the presence of the independent pronoun in reference 
to the subject of the main sentence. The verb in the subordinate sentence, 
however, must always be in the present tense.
The three preceding sentences in 32.1 above are replicated below with the 
necessary changes to illustrate this structure:
. َوَصَ لَتِ الطّ الِبَةُ تَـحْ مِلُ الكُ تُب
The student (F) arrived carrying the books.

The  حالclause could also be expressed by the use of an equational sentence. 
The main and subordinate clauses must be conjoined by  .واو احلالIn add
ition, the subject of the subordinate equational sentence must begin with an 
independent pronoun referring to the subject in the main clause. Examples 
below will include sentences in the singular, dual, and plural in the masculine 
and feminine:

Active participles, passive participles, or regular nouns can also be used to 
express  ,احلالin other words, the circumstance in which the action in the main 
clause was performed. These elements must always be accusative and indefinite. 
They must also agree with the subject of the main verb in number and gender. 
Consider the following examples in the singular, dual, and plural:

a certain event has happened as expressed by the verb in the main clause. 
Examine the following examples:

The children (M, Pl) met the members of the family with immense 
eagerness.
32.6 Neg tio
 of Haal 
l u e نَفْي احلال
Present tense verbs in Haal clauses are negated by the use of the negative par-
ticle  الplaced immediately before the verb in the subordinate clause, as in the 
following examples:
. َوَصَ لتِ الطّ الِبَةُ وهِيَ ال تَـحْ مِلُ الكُ تُب
The student (F) arrived [while she was] not carrying books.
. ُتَرَكَ صَ ديقي البَيْتَ وهُ وَ ال يَضْ حَ ك
My friend left the house [while he was] not laughing.
If the Haal clause is an equational sentence, the negative form of the verb َ كان
is used. This is done in two ways, either (1) by the use of the negative particle 
 ماwith the past tense of َ كانor (2) ْ َم لwith the present tense of َ كانin the jus-
sive. Examine the following two pairs of sentences in which the first sentence 
is in the affirmative, the second in the negative:
.ٌرَجَ عَتِ البِنْتُ وهِيَ غاضِ بَة
The girl returned angrily (lit. “and she was angry”).
.ًرَجَ عَتِ البِنْتُ وما كانَت غاضِ بَة
The girl came back (while she was) not angry.
. َرَجَ عَ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ وهُ مْ غاضِ بون
The teachers returned angrily (lit. “and they are / were angry”).
.َْ يكونوا غاضِ بنيَمرَجَ عَ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ وَل

The examples of Haal clauses in verbal sentences from 32.2 had verbs in the 
present tense. Haal clauses can also have verbs in the past tense. However, the 
use of the particle  قَدfollowed by a past tense verb is obligatory in this case 
(see Chapter 19 on past perfect tense). Examine the following examples:
. ِجاءَ األُسْ تاذُ إىل اجلامِعَةِ وَقَد اجْ تَمَعَ مَعَ الرَّئيس
The professor came to the university having met with the president.
.ًِبوا كَثرياَرعادَ األَصْ دِقاءُ مِنَ احلَفلَةِ وقَدْ أَكلوا وَش
The friends returned from the party having eaten and drunk a lot.

Tamyiiz, “accusative of specification,” is a construct using the indefinite and 
accusative form of a noun to add specification to a sentence by narrowing its 
terms. This structure is used in declarative sentences, or in reported statements 
introduced by verbs such as َّ“ قالَ إنhe said that,” َّ“ ذَكَرَ أنhe mentioned that,” 
َّ“ تَقَرَّرَ أنit was affirmed that,” and so on.
33.1 Comparisons Using Tamyiiz
Tamyiiz may be used to compare two or more entities in one or more respect(s), 
as in the following example:
.ًالقاهِرَة أَكْثَرُ مِن دِمَشْ ق سُ كّ انا
Cairo is more than Damascus population-wise.
The use of ً سُ كّ اناsingles out the specific, shared feature that is used as the point 
of comparison between Cairo and Damascus.
Recall that comparative adjectives  اِسْ م التَّفضيلcan also be used to make 
comparisons between two or more entities (see Chapter 27):
.سُ كّ انُ القاهِرَة أَكْثَرُ مِنْ سُ كّ انِ دِمَشْ ق
The population of Cairo is larger than the population of Damascus.
A tamyiiz construct may have a comparative form of an adjective expressing 
quantity or quality, followed by a noun that is always accusative and indefinite. 
Consider the examples below:
.ًدِمَشْ ق أَعْرَقُ مِنْ الرِّياض تارخيا
Damascus is more deep-rooted in history than Riyadh.

numbers), which are considered part of the tamyiiz structure in Arabic. The 
counted noun must be indefinite and singular, as in the following examples:
.ًَ طالِباَرسافَرَ أَحَ دَ عَشEleven students (M) traveled.
.ًسنيَ طالِبَةَمقابَلْنا خWe interviewed fifty students (F).
.ًَةَ مُوَظَّ فَةَرَ عَشِيرَجَ عَت ثَامنEighteen employees (F) returned.
.ًقَرَأَوا تِسْ عَةً وتِسْ عنيَ كِتاباThey read ninety-nine books.
33.3 W ig
s, 
as r s, and Tamyiiz
Materials that are explicitly conveyed in units of weight or measure may be 
expressed in a tamyiiz construct in the accusative, following the unit of weight 
or measure. Terms expressing weight include ٌ“ رَطْ لpound” and the newly- 
introduced “ كيلوغرامkilogram,” ٌّ“ طَ نa thousand kilograms,” the classical ٌ قِنْطار
“a varying weight, kantar.” Terms that express measure include ٌ“ ذِراعcubit, length 
measure,” or newly-introduced foreign word ٌ ْر“ مِتmeter,” “ كيلو مِتkilometer,” 
“ ميلa mile,” “ يارْدِةa yard,” “ هِكتارa hectare,” and the Egypt-specific “ فَدّانa 
land measure.” These nouns form the tamyiiz construct, as in the following:

Tamyiiz
407
.ًَيْنِ قُطْ ناْرَيْتُ مِتَراِشْ تI bought two meters of cotton.
.ًْراَمباعَنا ثَالثَةَ أَرْطالٍ تHe sold us three pounds of dates.
.ًيَمْلِكُ هِكْ تاراً أَرْضاHe owns a hectare of land.
Thus the nouns following the measure or weigh words ً“ قُطناcotton,” ًْراَم“ تdates,” 
and ً“ أَرْضاland” in the preceding sentences must always be indefinite and ac-
cusative. They specify the substances of the measure and weight unit nouns 
that precede them.
Weights and measures can also be expressed by an IDhaafa-construct (see 
Chapter 8 on IDhaafa). The preceding examples can be expressed by the use 
of an IDhaafa structure as follows:
.ٍَيْ قُطْ نْرَيْتُ مِتَراِشْ تI bought two meters of cotton.
.ٍباعَنا ثَالثَةَ أَرْطالِ تـَمْرHe sold us three pounds of dates.
. ٍيـَمْلِـكُ هِكْ تارَ أَرْضHe owns a hectare of land.
The weights and measures in the preceding examples can be expressed by the use 
of the preposition  مِنfollowed by the noun expressing the materials, as follows:
.َِيْنِ مِنَ القُطْ نْرَيْتُ مِتَراِشْ تI bought two meters of cotton.
.ِباعَنا ثَالثَةَ أَرْطالٍ مِنَ التَّمْرHe sold us three pounds of dates.
. ِيـَمْلِكُ هِكْ تاراً مِنَ األَرْضHe owns a hectare of land.
This last pattern is more common in Modern Standard Arabic.
33.4 ْ“ كَمo
 m
,” “Ho
 many” and Tamyiiz
Nouns following the interrogative word ْ كَمare always in the singular, indefinite, 
accusative. These nouns are considered to be a tamyiiz construct. Examine the 
following:
كَم كِتاباً قَرَأَْتَ ؟How many books did you read?
ِكَةُ؟َّركَم بَيْتاً بَنَتِ الشHow many houses did the company build?

Several particles are used to express exception in Arabic, the notion that some 
entity is singled out as a non-participant in the performance of an event or as 
its only participant. These include: ّ“ إِالexcept,” ُ ْر“ غَيother than,”  سِ وى / عَدا
 / ما عَدا / ما خَ الand  – حاشاall meaning “except,” or “except for.”  ما خَ الand 
 حاشاappear more in classical texts; they are not as frequently used in Modern 
Standard Arabic.  عداhas another equivalent preceded by the negative particle 
 ماto express the same meaning.  ما  خَ الon the other hand is invariable and 
always preceded by the negative particle  .ماHowever,  حاشاis never preceded 
by the negative particle  .ماEach of these particles will be presented separately 
in the following sections:
34.1 ّإِال
This particle is used in affirmative sentences to indicate that someone or some 
entity is not a participant in an event performed by several others. The noun 
following ّ إالin this case must be in the accusative and indefinite (marked by 
tanwiin), as in the following:
.ًسافَرَ الطُّ الّبُ إالّ طالِباThe students traveled except one.
.ًتَكَ لَّمَتِ الـمُ عَلِّامتُ إالّ مُعَلِّمَةAll the teachers spoke except one.
The accusative noun following ّ إِالcan be definite by virtue of its being a part 
of a definite IDhaafa-construct, as in the following:
.َِ الـمُ دَرِّسونَ إِالّ مُدَرِّسَ العَربيَّةَرحَ ض
All the instructors came except the Arabic instructor.
CHAPTER 34
Exception ناءْتِثْاالس

Exception
409
ّ إِالcan be used before nouns in sentences negated by one of the negative  
particles سْ / لَن / لَيَْ م .ال /  ما /  لThe case of the noun following ّ إِالcan be  
accusative or nominative, as in the following:
.ً يُسافِرِ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ إِالّ مُعَلِّامً واحِ داَْ مل
The teachers did not travel except for one.
. ٌ يُسافِرِ الـمُ عَلِّمونَ إِالّ مُعَلِّمٌ واحِ دَْ مل
The teachers did not travel except for one.
In sentences where the  فاعِلis not explicitly stated, the case of the noun follow
ing ّ إِالdepends on the verb used. If the verb is intransitive, the noun following 
it must be in the nominative, as in the following:
.ِ إِالّ طالِبانْ يَفُزَْ مل
None succeeded except two students.
.ٌ إِالّ مُدَرِّسونَ ثَالثَةْحَ كْ يَضَْ مل
No one laughed except (for) three instructors.
On the other hand, if the verb whose  فاعِلis not explicitly stated is transitive, 
the noun following ّ إِالis treated as a direct object marked for the accusative 
case, as in the following:
.ًامً واحِ داْما شاهَدوا إِالّ فِل
lit. “They did not see but one film.” or “They only saw one film.”
.ِنْ إِالّ كِتابَيـْرَأْ يَقَْ مل
lit. “He did not read but two books.” or “He only read two books.”
34.2 ما عَدا
The noun following  ما عَداmust be in the accusative. Examine the following 
sentences:
.ًشاهَدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّمَةُ كُلَّ الطُّ الّبِ ما عَدا طالِباً واحِ دا
The teacher (F) saw all the students except (for) one student.

.ًوَصَ لَت كُلُّ املُدَرِّساتِ ما عَدا مُدَرِّسَ ةً واحِ دَة
All the teachers (F, Pl) came but one.
34.3 عَدا
A variation of  ما عَداis  عَداwithout the negative particle  .ماThe noun fol
lowing this particle can be either in the accusative, as in the following  
example:
.ًشاهَدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّمَةُ الطُّ الّبَ عَدا طالِباً واحِ دا
The teacher saw the students except (for) one.
Or it can be in the genitive, as in the following:
.ٍشاهَدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّمَةُ الطُّ الّبَ عَدا طالِبٍ واحِ د
The teacher saw the students except (for) one.
34.4 ُ ْرغَي
This particle can be used in affirmative or negated sentences. It functions 
as the first term of the IDhaafa-construct; the noun following  غَيis in the  
genitive.  غَيis in the accusative in affirmative sentences, as in the following 
example:
.ٍسافَرَ كُلُّ الطُّ الّبِ غَيرْ َ واحِ د
All the students traveled except (for) one.
.َ الطُّ البُ غَيرْ َ خالِدَرحَ ض
The students all came except Khaled.

Exception
411
Following transitive verbs, ُ ْر غَيis marked for the accusative case, as in the  
following:
.ٍتاذَةُ غيرْ َ طالِبٍ واحِ دْما شاهَدَتِ األُس
The teacher (F) did not see (anyone) except (for) one student.
.ٍما زاروا غَيرْ َ مَدينَةٍ واحِ دَة
lit. “They did not visit but one city.” or “They only visited  
  one city.”
Following prepositions,  غَيends with kasra, the genitive marker, as in the  
following:
.ٍمَرّوا بِغَيرْ ِ مَدينَة
They passed through more than one city.
Following a negated intransitive verb  غَيis in the nominative, as in the  
following:
.ٍريُ طالِبٍ واحِ دَما سافَرَ غ
No one traveled except (for) one student.
34.5 سِ وى
This invariable particle must be followed by a noun in the genitive, thus form-
ing an IDhaafa-construct. The noun following this particle can be indefinite or 
definite, as in the following examples:
.ٍسافَرَ كُلُّ الطالّبِ سِ وى طالِبٍ واحِ د
All the students traveled except (for) one.
.ِسافَرَ كُلُّ الطُّ الّبِ سِ وى الطّ الِبِ اجلَديد
All the students traveled except the new one.
.زاروا اجلامِعاتِ سِ وى جامِعَةِ حَ لَب
They visited (all) the universities except Aleppo University.

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
412
In addition,  سِ وىcan have a suffixal pronoun attached to it. This pronoun is 
usually a referent to someone previously mentioned in the discourse:
.ما سافَرَ أَحَ دٌ سِ واها
None traveled except for her.
.ُ سِ واهْ نُقابِلَْ مل
We did not meet anyone except him.
In the sentence above, the pronoun refers to a female who has been previously 
mentioned by discourse participants; in the second the pronoun refers to a 
person previously introduced.
34.6 ما خَ ال
This particle, infrequently used, is invariable; its behavior is similar to that of 
 ما عَداintroduced above. In other words, the noun following  ما خَ الmust be in 
the accusative, as in the following:
.ًشاهَدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّمَةُ كُلَّ الطُّ الّبِ ما خَ ال طالِباً واحِ دا
The teacher saw all the students except (for) one.
.«ناطَ ةْرَسَ ةَ غَرْنا الـمَدارِسَ ما خَ ال «مَدْزُر
We visited (all) the schools except Granada School.
34.7 خَ ال
A variation of  ما خَ الis  خَ الwithout the negative particle  .ماThe noun follow-
ing this particle can be either in the accusative, as in the following example:
.ًشاهَدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّمَةُ الطُّ الّبَ خَ ال طالِباً واحِ دا
The teacher saw (all) the students except (for) one.
Or it can be in the genitive, as in the following:
.ٍشاهَدَتِ الـمُ عَلِّمَةُ الطُّ الّبَ خَ ال طالِبٍ واحِ د
The teacher saw (all) the students except (for) one.

34.8 حاشا
This particle is invariable; it cannot be preceded by the negative particle  .ما
The noun following  حاشاcan be either in the accusative, as in the following:
.ًَ الـمُ ديرونَ حاشا مُديراَرحَ ض
The directors came except for one.
Or it can be in the genitive, as in:
.ٍَ الـمُ ديرونَ حاشا مُديرَرحَ ض
The directors came except for one.
The particles that are not preceded by the negative particle  ,ماnamely  عَدا / حاشا
and  ,خَ الexhibit identical behavior in that they are followed by either accusa-
tive or genitive nouns.
34.9 ِناءْتِثْباِس
The notion of exception can be expressed by the use of the invariable pre
positional phrase ِناءْتِثْ ,باسwhich consists of the preposition  بِـand the maSdar 
تِثناءْ .اِسIt may be used with affirmative or negated sentences. This phrase could 
be the first noun in the IDhaafa-construct, as in the following example:
.ٍتِثناءِ طالِبٍ واحِ دَْ كُلُّ الطالّبِ بِاسَرحَ ض
All the students came except (for) one student.
.ٍما سافَرَتِ الـمُ عَلِّامتُ باستِثناءِ مُعَلِّمَةٍ واحِ دَة
The teachers (F) did not travel except (for) one.
.ٍناءِ صَ فٍّ واحِ دْتِثْدَخَ لَت كُلَّ الصُّ فوفِ باِس

The vocative structure is the means of calling for an addressee’s attention. The 
most commonly used vocative particles,  حُ روف النِّداءin Arabic, are the following: 
 ياfollowed by  أيهُّ اand  .أيَّتُهاThere are less commonly used particles that include 
 أَياand ُّ .أَيEach of these particles is restricted in usage. In addition, each has 
an impact on the case and determination (definite/indefinite) of nouns follow-
ing it. Each particle is presented separately.
35.1 يا
 ياis commonly used to address a specific person or specific persons directly. 
Masculine or feminine nouns can follow this particle.  ياcan be followed by:
1.
A proper noun, such as َد، مَرْيـَمْم ,أَحas in َدْم يا أحor يا مَرْيَم
2.
A common indefinite noun or title of a person familiar to the interlocutor. 
The noun in this instance must be in the nominative case without the tan-
wiin “nunation,” as in the following examples:
ُيا أُسْ تاذO, professor
ُيا طالِبO, student
ُيا سَ يِّدَةO, madam
ُيا آنِسَ ةO, miss
3.
An IDhaafa-construct. The noun following  ,ياin this case, i.e. the first noun 
of the IDhaafa, must be in the accusative without the tanwiin, as in the 
following examples:
. . . ِّيا أُسْ تاذَ األَدَبِ العَرَيبO, professor of Arabic literature
. . . يا مَلِكَ البِالدO, your majesty
CHAPTER 35
Vocative الـمُ نادى

. . . يا أَخا العَرَبO, dear friend
. . .  ِّيا مُعَلِّمَ الصَّ فO, teacher
. . . ِيا طالِبَ اجلامِعَةO, university student
. . . َيا أَمريَ الـمُ ؤْمِننيO, the commander of the faithful
Dual nouns in the accusative can follow this particle. In the IDhaafa-
construct the nuun in dual or plural nouns must be dropped, as in the 
following:
. . . ِِكَةَّرْ الشَييا مُهَنْدِسO, you (D) engineers (M)
. . .  ِّيا طالِبَتَيْ الصَّ فO, you (D) students (F)
. . . ِْ اجلامِعَةَييا أُسْ تاذَتO, you (D) university professors (F)
Similarly, plural nouns can also follow this particle. Regular masculine 
plural nouns in the IDhaafa-construct lose their nuun, as in the following:
. . . ِيا مُعَلِّمي اجلامِعَةO, you (Pl) university professors (M)
…. ِِكَةَّريا مُديري الشO, you (Pl) company directors (M)
. . .  ِّيا طالِباتِ الصَّ فO, you (Pl) students (F)
… ِِكَةَّريا مُهَنْدِساتِ الشO, you (Pl) engineers (F)
4.
A common indefinite noun. The noun in this instance must be indefinite, 
accusative with the tanwiin. This construction is used when the addressee 
is not known or familiar to the speaker, as in the following examples:
!ِيا رَجُ الً ال تَرْمِ الوَرَقَ يف الشّ ارِعSir, don’t throw paper in the street!
! ْيا طالِباً، اُدْرُسْ تَنْجَ حO, student (M), if you study, you  
will be successful!
!يا سَ يِّدةً، اِرْجَ عي إىل الوَراءِ مِنْ فَضْ لِكMadam, please go back!
5.
A derived adjective, whether ِ“ اِسْ مُ الفاعِلactive participle,” or ِ اِسْ مُ الـمَفْعول
“passive participle,” or a regular adjective, as in the following:

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
416
!ََ ّلهيا ظالـِامً، اِتَّقِ الO, you oppressor, fear God!
ِ! ِيا كَسوالً حانَ وَقْتُ العَمَلO, you lazy one, time to work!
! ٍيا مَظْ لوماً، الفَرَجُ آتO, you oppressed, relief is near/coming!
!ِْسِ ناً ال تَبْخَ لْ عَىل الفُقَراءُحيا مO, you charitable one, don’t be  
tight-fisted with the poor!
It is possible to drop the vocative particle  ياin addressing a person or per-
sons familiar to the caller. The structure is an IDhaafa-construct with the 
first noun in the accusative, as in the following examples:
!ِصَ ديقَ العُمْرO, my lifelong friend!
! ِّطُ الّبَ الصَّ فStudents!
! ِزَيْنَ الشَّ بابYou, the handsomest of men!
However, the deletion of  ياis not possible with “ اللGod,” as in the following:
!يا الO, God!
The use of  ياas a vocative particle denotes a stylistic variation known  
in Arabic grammar as “ اِسْ تِغاثَةinvocation for help.” The use of  ياin this 
case is obligatory and must be followed by َ لـin specifying the problem, as 
in:
!ِيا لَلْحُ رّاس لِلنّارO, guards, fire!
! ِيا لَلنّاسِ لِلْمُ صابO, people, the injured one!
Moreover,  ياexpresses exclamation when a person witnesses an awe-inspiring 
phenomenon or event.  ياcan be followed, in this case, by َ لـor ِ لـattached 
to a definite noun, as in the following, expressing exclamation about an 
awe-inspiring event or person:
!ِ يا لَلْحُ سْ نor !ِيا لِلْحُ سْ نWhat a beauty!
! ِ يا لَلْغُروبor ! ِيا لِلْغُروبWhat a sunset!

Vocative
417
The preceding exclamation can be expressed without َ لـor ِ ,لـthus making 
the nouns accusative, as in the following:
!ًيا حُ سْ ناWhat a beauty!
!ًيا غُ روباWhat a sunset!
The phrase “ يا إهليOh, my God!” is not so much a call to God for help 
as it is an expression of wonderment and surprise as a result of observing 
some event or phenomenon. Whereas the phrase  يا إِهليuses the vocative 
particle  ياthis particle is dropped in the use of َّ ,اللّهُمas in:
!َ ْراللّهُمَّ ، أَعْطِنا الصَّ بGod, give us patience!
!ُاللّهُمَّ ، مِنْكَ العَفْوُ والـمَغْفِرَةGod, we seek forgiveness from You!
35.2 “ نُدْبَةl m n
ion”
Another form of the vocative is what Arab grammarians refer to as “ نُدْبَةlam-
entation,” which is often used to express sadness, impatience, or a feeling of 
impending or manifest disaster, or one that has happened. Two particles are 
used in nudba, namely  ياor  .واHowever, the use of  ياis less common than  ,وا
which is often followed by the name of a person or a place in the nominative 
to whom a disaster has befallen, as in the following:
!َمَّدُحوا مO, Muhammad!
!وا فاطِمَةO, Fatima!
The noun following  واoften has the suffixal pronoun for third person masculine 
singular appended to it, namely  ,هby which someone bemoans the fate of a 
person or thing dear to his/her heart. Consider the following:
!وا لَيْالهO, my Laila!
!وا قُدْساهO, what befell Jerusalem!

FUNDAMENTALS OF arabic grammar
418
The nudba particle can be followed by the IDhaafa-construct, in which the first 
noun must be in the accusative, as in the following:
!ِوا مُصْ لِحَ الوَطَ نO, reformer of the land!
!َِ العِلْمِروا ناشO, promulgator of knowledge!
35.3 أيهُّ ا
 أَيهُّ اis used in public speeches with masculine nouns, or with a mixed group of 
males and females. In modern Arab societies, this particle is often used to 
introduce radio or television programs, or speakers in a public speech setting. 
Nouns following this particle must have the definite article  الـand must be in 
the nominative. Nouns following singular, dual, or plural nouns can follow  .أَيهُّ ا
Consider the following examples:
! ُأَيهُّ ا األَخُ الكَ ريمMy dear friend!
! َِأَيهُّ ا األَخَ وانِ الكَ ريامنMy dear friends (M, D)!
!أَيهُّ ا اإلخْ وَةُ الـمُ واطِنونMy countrymen (M, Pl)!
!ُأَيهُّ ا األَساتِذَةُ الكِرامDistinguished professors (M, Pl)!
!ُأَيهُّ ا السِّ يداتُ واآلنِساتُ والسّ ادَةُ الكِرامEsteemed ladies and gentlemen  
(F/M, Pl)!
35.4 أَيَّتُها
 أَيَّتُهاis used with feminine nouns to address an all-female group. The noun 
following  أَيَّتُهاmust be in the nominative, as in the following:
! ُأَيَّتُها السَّ يِّداتُ الكَ ريامتGracious ladies (F)!
! ُأَيَّتُها الـمُ عَلِّامتُ الفاضِ التHighly esteemed teachers (F)!
! ُأَيَّتُها ااخلِرّجياتُ النَّجيباتDistinguished graduates (F)!

Vocative
419
35.5 يا أَيَّتُها / يا أَيهُّ ا
In Quranic Arabic  ياand  أَيهُّ اare combined in one vocative particle  ,يا أَيهُّ اas 
in:
. . . يا أَيهُّ ا اَلَّذينَ آمَنواO, believers . . .
. . . يا أَيهُّ ا النّاسO, people . . .
 أَيَْتُهاand  ياare also combined to address feminine nouns, as in:
يا أَيْتُها النَّفْسُ املُطْ مَئِنَّةO, [thou] soul in complete satisfaction . . .
 يا أَيهُّ اand  يا أَيَّتُهاare heard in Modern Standard Arabic, especially in formal 
speeches.
35.6 أَي
The vocative particle ْ أَيis used less frequently in Modern Standard Arabic. 
This particle is likely to be encountered in elevated styles of written Arabic, 
usually followed by a definite diminutive or proper noun, typically a son or a 
daughter. Its usage expresses emotional closeness to the addressee, as in the 
following:
! َّأَيْ بُنَيO, my [little] son!
!أَيْ بُنَيَّتيO, my [little] daughter!
!محَدَأَيْ أO, Ahmad!
The word ّ بُنَيis the diminutive form of “ اِبْنson.” On the other hand,  بُنَيَّتيhas 
the diminutive form ٌ بُنَيَّةderived from ٌ“ بِنْتdaughter, girl,” plus the possessive 
suffix “ يmy.”

Several forms are used to express exclamation, wonderment, a sense of awe 
or disgust.
36.1  ماplus Comparative 
dje tives
One method is by the use of the particle  ماfollowed by a comparative form of 
an adjective expressing a state. The comparative adjective must always be in 
the accusative case, ending with one fat-Ha. Following  ماplus the comparative 
adjective form, a noun in the accusative case must be used. Consider the  
following examples:
!َما أَجمْ َلَ السَّ امءHow beautiful the sky is!
! َما أَلَذَّ الطَّ عامHow delicious this food is!
! َبْظَ عَ هذِهِ احلَرْما أَفHow horrible this war is!
With basic color words such as ُ“ أَحمْ َرred,” ُرَقْ“ أَزblue,” and others formed 
from َّعَلْ اِفverbs (Form IX), the preceding paradigm does not apply. Instead, 
the accusative comparative forms of adjectives which express the intensity of 
color such as َّ( أَشَ دfrom ٌ“ شَ ديدstrong, intense”) and َمَقْ( أَغfrom “ غامِقdeep 
in color”) are used (see Chapter 4 on color adjectives). This adjective form is 
followed by the maSdar for colors in the accusative. The noun following the 
maSdar is in the genitive, essentially forming the second noun of the IDhaafa-
construct. Examine the following examples:
!ِهارْرَةَ األَزُْ مما أَشَ دَّ حHow deep the redness of flowers is!
!َِ ةَ الشَّ جَ رْرمَقَ خُ ضْما أَغHow deep the verdancy of trees is!
CH

Similarly, the expression َّ“ ما أَشَ دhow intense,” or others expressing degrees of 
intensity such as َثَرْ“ ما أَكhow much,” or َّ“ ما أَقَلhow less, few,” for example, 
are used with maSdars derived from intransitive verbs, such as ٌ“ غَضَ بanger,” 
from َ“ غَضِ بto be angry,” and ٌمْ“ نَوsleep,” from َ“ نامto sleep.” This also applies 
to maSdars such as ٌّ حُ بderived from the transitive verb َّ“ أَحَ بto love, to like.” 
Examine the following:
!ما أَشَ دَّ غَضَ بَهاHow deep her anger is!
!ُمَهَْ عَ نَوْرما أَسHow fast he goes to sleep!
!ِّمَقَ حُ بَّ األُمْما أَعHow deep is a mother’s love!
!ُثَرَ إِيامنَهْما أَكHow deep his belief is!
A nominal relative clause can follow the exclamatory  ماplus the comparative 
adjective form. Such a clause may begin with ْ أَنfollowed by a verb in the 
subjunctive, as in the following:
!ٍسانُ يف بيئَةٍ جَ ديدَةْـلَـمَ اإلِنْ يَتَأَقْعَبَ أَنْما أَص
How difficult for people to adapt to a new environment!
!ُِبُّ األَخُ أَخاهُح يْوَعَ أَنْما أَر
How wonderful for people to love one another!
ْ أَنplus the subjunctive verb can be replaced by a maSdar derived from the verb 
following ْ أَنproducing an IDhaafa-construct. The previous two examples can 
be expressed as follows:
!ٍسانِ يف بيئَةٍ جَ ديدَةْلُمَ اإلِنْعَبَ تَأَقْما أَص
How difficult for people to adapt to a new environment!
!َِخيهِلأ ِوَعَ حُ بَّ األَخْما أَر
How wonderful for people to love one another!
36.2 ما  . . .   ماplus 
erbal 
rases
Another type of exclamatory clause begins with the exclamatory  ماplus a 
comparative adjective, followed by  ماand a verb in the present tense indicative, 
as in the following:

!َُ عَ ما يَفورُ غَضَ بُهْرما أَسHow fast his anger boils!
Again, accusative maSdars of the verbs following the second  ماin the preceding 
sentences can replace  ماplus the indicative verb to convey the same meaning, 
as in the following:
!ٍما أَشَ دَّ مُقاساتَهُ مِن آالمHow intense are his pains!
!ِرَةَ غَضَ بِهَْ عَ فَوْرما أَسHow fast his anger boils!
36.3 ِ بـْعِلْأَف
Another less frequently used way of expressing exclamation in Modern Stand-
ard Arabic is by constructing verbs from adjectives according to the عِل  بِـْ أَف
pattern. Such verbal patterns must adhere to the following conditions: the verb 
from which the adjective is derived must be tri-consonantal in the active voice, 
not preceded by a negative particle. Additionally, these adjectives must express 
characteristics that allow comparison. Thus, the adjective “ كَريمnoble, gener-
ous,” is based on “ كرمto be generous, noble.” The exclamatory form according 
to  بِـْعِلْ أَفis, therefore, رِم بِـْ .أَكFrom ٌ“ حَ سَ نto be good,” the form  بِـْسِنْ أَحis 
derived. In discourses, one hears the following:
!ٍ رَجُ لْد مِنْ بِزَيْرِمْأَكWhat a noble man, Zayd!
!ٍ صَ ديقْ بِهِ مِنْسِنْأَحWhat a good friend he is!
36.4 َيا لـِ / لـ
Exclamation can also be expressed by the use of the vocative particle  ياfollowed 
by a noun in the genitive case that must begin with the preposition  لِـor َ .لـ
Examine the following examples:
!ِأَةْيا لـِجَ املِ هذِهِ الـمَرHow beautiful this woman is!
!ِأَةْيا لَـجَ املِ هذِهِ الـمَرHow beautiful this woman is!
!ِيا لِغَرابَةِ هذا السُّ ؤالHow strange this question is!
! ِيا لَغَرابَةِ هذا السُّ ؤالHow strange this question is!

Exclamation
423
The preceding exclamatory phrases form an IDhaafa-construct. The exclama-
tory  ,ياhowever, can be followed by a single noun with the preposition  لِـor َ لـ
prefixed to it. Examine the following:
! ِيا لِلعَجَ بHow strange this is!
!عَجَ بْيا لَلHow strange this is!
!ِيا لِلزَّمَنlit. “Woe to time!” [Times have changed!]
!ِيا لَلزَّمَنlit. “Woe to time!” [Times have changed!]
 ياcan be followed by َ لـwith a pronoun suffix attached to it, as in the following:
!ٍ رَجُ لْيا لَهُ مِنWhat a man!
!ٍ سَ يِّدَةٍ فاضِ لَةْا مِنَهيا لWhat a gracious lady!
Finally, the following commonly used phrases are considered a part of  
exclamation:
!حانَ الْسُ بPraise the Lord!
!ما شاءَ الAmazing!
!يا إهليO my God!
!يا سَ المGood heavens!
!بْالهلّ ُ أَكWhat a wonderful thing!
36.5 ْكَم
ْ“ كَمhow much, how many,” was introduced in Chapter 6 as an interrogative 
particle and mentioned as a particle used in tamyiiz (see Chapter 33 on tamyiiz). 
It can also be used to express exclamation, as in the following examples:
! ٌّ هُ وَ غَبِيْكَمHow stupid he is!
!ٌيلَةَم هِيَ جْكَمHow beautiful she is!
! ٌسُ رائِعْ هذا الطَّ قْكَمHow wonderful this weather is!

36.6 َمْ نِعand َسْبِئ
There are two fossilized lexical items not considered part of exclamation, the 
subject of study in this chapter. These two items are used to extoll someone’s 
or something’s virtue, or to disparage or derogate someone or something: one 
positive َمْ“ نِعhow good,” and the other negative َسْ“ بِئhow awful.” These can 
be followed by nouns in the nominative or clauses beginning with  ,ماas in the 
following examples:
! ُمَ الرَّجُ لْنِعWhat a good man he is!
!ِمَ ما أُالقي مِن كَرَمٍ يف هذِهِ البِالدْنِعHow wonderful, what I encounter 
of generosity in this country!
! ُضاعِْكَ األوْ تلْسَ تْبِئHow awful these situations are!
!ٍ هُ راءْسَ ما قالَهُ مِنْبِئHow awful, what nonsense he said!

The literal meaning of  بَدَلis substitution. The accepted term among  
grammarians is “apposition,” or “appositional noun,” or “noun in apposition.” 
Some traditional grammarians of Arabic have called this grammatical structure 
“explanation,” “clarification,” or “repetition.”
Structurally, this amounts to juxtaposing a noun or noun phrase to another 
noun to reinforce the former and to provide more complete information, or to 
remove possible ambiguities. Generally, there is agreement between these two 
nouns in case, number, gender, and determination (definiteness/indefiniteness). 
Nouns of apposition, or substitution, are of four kinds:
37.1 Sub titution of a noun for the whole
Examine the following examples:
. َكَلَّمَني أَحمْ َد أخوكAhmad, your brother, talked to me.
.ِنا عَن عُ مَر، اخلَليفَةِ العادِلْقَرَأWe read about Omar, the just Caliph.
In these sentences, َ“ أَخوكyour brother” can totally substitute for the noun  أَحمْ َد
and the phrase “ اخلَليفة العادِلthe Just Caliph” can substitute for “ عُ مَرOmar.” 
They are in agreement with these nouns in case, in addition to number, gender, 
and determination.
Repetition of nouns or noun phrases for further descriptive purposes is 
often encountered, as in the following examples:
.َطافنيَْةِ بالـمُ صِمدَحْنا يف الشَّ وارِعِ، الشَّ وارِعِ الـمُ زْمَشَ ي
We walked in the streets, the streets full of tourists.
!نا اجلِبالَ العالِيَةَ، وأَيَّ جِ بالْتَسَ لَّق
We climbed the high mountains, what mountains!

Apposition البَدَل

FUNDAMENTALS OF ARABIC GRAMMAR
426
37.2 Sub titution of a art for the whole
In this case, the noun in apposition must have attached to it a suffix pronoun 
that agrees in number and gender with the antecedent noun, as in the following:
.ُفَهْتُ الكتابَ نِصْقَرَأI read the book, one-half of it.
.سَ ثُلُثَهاْتُ الكَ أِْبَرشI drank the glass, one-third of it.
37.3 Com rehen ive 
ub titution
The noun in apposition agrees with the substituted noun in case, and it must 
also attach to a suffix pronoun agreeing in number and gender with the sub-
stituted noun. Examine the following example:
.ُُهْرجَ بَني الـمُ ديرُ صَ بْأَعThe director pleased me, his patience.
37.4 Corre ting one elf
Finally, a noun is said to be in apposition to another noun when a speaker 
corrects himself or herself by mentioning a noun unlike the one which he or 
she uttered erroneously. Thus, if one intends to state that one read a book, but 
slipped up and mentioned another object of reading, one repeats the intended 
noun. Examine the following example:
.ًتُ رِسالَةً، كِتاباْقَرَأI read a letter, a book.
Thus ً“ كِتاباa book” in the preceding example is in apposition to ً“ رِسالَةa 
letter.” Note that these words share the same case marker and determination.

The quantifiers ّ كُلand “ جمَ يعall of,”عْضَ بand مَ“ مُعْظmost of,” were presented 
in Chapter 31. Their use in sentences can indicate emphasis of nouns.  
Additionally, the use of َّ“ إِنindeed” at the beginning of equational sentences 
(see Chapter 21) was indicated to add emphasis to propositions expressed in 
sentences. In what follows, two more elements that indicate emphasis of nouns 
will be presented, namely فْسَ نand يـْنَ ,عـboth with the meaning of “same 
[himself/herself].”
38.1 فْسَيـْن / نَع
يـْنَ عand فْسَ نmust follow the nouns intended for emphasis. However, the use 
of these two elements in positions before nouns is becoming increasingly wide-
spread in Modern Literary Arabic. When they follow nouns, فْسَ نor يـْنَ ع
function as adjectives (see Chapter 4 on adjectives). However, فْسَ نand يـْنَ ع
are invariable with respect to gender. When either فْسَ نor يـْنَ عfollow a noun, 
the masculine, singular suffix pronoun ُ( هor ِ هwhen preceded by a kasra or a 
yaa’) or the feminine, singular pronoun  هاmust attach to فْسَ نor يـْنَ ,عas in 
the following examples:
.ُيْنُهَ الـمُ ديرُ عَلَصَوThe director (M, Sg) himself arrived.
.يْنُهاَةُ عَت الـمُ ديرَلَصَوThe director (F, Sg) herself arrived.
يـْنَ عand فْسَ نassume the same case of the noun preceding them. Consider 
the following:
.ُهَفْسَ نَلْنا الـمُ ديرَقابWe met the director (M, Sg) himself.
.هاَفْسَ نَةَلْنا الـمُ ديرَقابWe met the director (F, Sg) herself.

38.1.1 فْسَيـْن / نَ عin the dual
When فْسَ نor يـْنَ عfollows a noun in the dual, two options are available: Either 
the singular forms of these words are used, or their dual forms ِفْسانَ نand ِيْنانَ ,ع
respectively. The dual forms are invariable with respect to gender; however, 
they must agree in case with the preceding noun. Examine the following  
examples, in which the first pair is in the singular, the second in the dual:
.فْسُ هُامَ الـمُ ديرانِ نَرَسافThe two directors (M) themselves left.
.فْسُ هُامَتانِ نَتِ الـمُ ديرَرَسافThe two directors (F) themselves left.
.اُمفْساهَ الـمُ ديرانِ نَرَسافThe two directors (M) themselves left.
.اُمفْساهَتانِ نَتِ الـمُ ديرَرَسافThe two directors (F) themselves left.
Recall that the nuun of ِفْسانَ نis dropped when the dual suffix اُم هis attached, 
essentially forming an IDhaafa-construct.
The noun emphasized in the following two sentences, i.e., ِـيـْنَتَ ,الـمُ ديرis 
in the accusative case. In the first sentence يـْنَ عis in the singular; in the second 
it is in the dual.
.هُامَيْنَيـْنِ عَتَلْنا الـمُ ديرَقابWe met the two directors (F) themselves.
.يْهِامَيْنَيْـنِ عَتَلْنا الـمُ ديرَقابWe met the two directors (F) themselves.
38.1.2 فسَيـْن / نَ عin the plural
The plural of فْسَ نor يـْنَ عis formed according to the pattern فْعُلَ أgenerating 
نْفُسَ أor عْيـُنَ .أThe appropriate masculine plural suffix pronoun ْ ,هُ مor the 
feminine plural suffix pronoun َّ هُ نmust attach to نْفُسَ أor عْيـُنَنْفُس.أَ أor 
عْيـُنَ أare invariable with respect to gender; however, they must agree in case 
with the noun preceding them, as in the following examples:
. َّنْفُسُ هُنَلِّامتُ أَتِ الـمُ عَلَصَو
The teachers (F, Pl) themselves arrived.
. َّهُنَنْفُسَلِّامتِ أَلْنا الـمُ عَقاب
We met the teachers (F, Pl) themselves.

Emphasis
429
. ْنْفُسِهِمَ أَ الـمُ ديرينَعَبوا مَكاتَت
They corresponded with the directors (M, Pl) themselves.
Recall that the accusative marker of feminine plural nouns ending with  اتis 
always a kasra, not a fat-Ha.
With non-human plurals such as ٌ“ مُدُ نcities” or ٌ“ كُتُبbooks,” for example, 
only the singular form فْسَ نor يـْنَ عcan be used. The suffix pronoun attached 
to these words must be the feminine singular form  ,هاused in reference to 
non-human plural nouns, as in the following examples:
.هاَفْسَ نَةُ الـمُ دُ نَتِ الصَّ ديقَزار
The friend (F) visited the same cities. (lit. “the cities themselves”)
.هاَفْسَ نَ الطُّ البُ الكُ تُبَأَرَق
The students read the same books. (lit. “the books themselves”)
38.2 “ ذاتs lf”
In Modern Standard Arabic, the word “ ذاتself” is often used for emphasis. 
Thus, one frequently encounters sentences like the following:
.ُهَ ذاتَيرَنُقابِلُ الـمُ دَس
We shall meet the director himself.
.اِهةِ ذاتَزيرَ الـوَعَمِعُ مَجْ تَكُلَّ أُسْ بوعٍ ن
Every week, we meet with the minister herself.
38.3 Em
sis by P onoun R
i ion
Emphasis can also be indicated by the repetition of an independent pronoun 
in reference to a suffixal pronoun mentioned in the sentence. This suffixal 
pronoun functions as antecedent to the independent pronoun used. Examine 
the following sentences:
.َهُ هُ وَعَلَّمْنا مَكَ وتَلْنا الـمُ ديرَقاب
We met the director and we spoke with him.

. ِبرياً للحِ زْبَاً كْرصَ نَى كانَـنْفَ الـمَ مِنَرُجوعُ ها هِي
Her return from exile was a big victory for the [political] party.
The independent pronouns َ“ هُ وhe,” َنْتَ“ أyou (M),” and َ“ هِيshe” in the preced
ing sentences add emphasis to the referents that preceded them in these  
sentences.
