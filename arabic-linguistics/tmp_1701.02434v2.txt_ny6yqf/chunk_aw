Fig 39. Naively expanding a trajectory until a dynamic termination criterion is satisﬁed is not suﬃcient to
ensure reversibility and hence the validity of the resulting Markov chain. When expanding trajectories mul-
tiplicatively, for example, if the termination criterion is satisﬁed by any sub-tree, for example the trajectory
beginning at z2 and ending at z3, then both T(t | z2) = 0 and T(t | z3) = 0 despite T(t | z0) ̸= 0. To avoid
this pathology we have to reject any trajectory expansions that contain such pathological sub-trajectories.

Fig 40. (a) In an additive expansion scheme we have to check the termination criterion for all sub-
trajectories between each point in the old trajectory and the single point in the new trajectory. (b) In a
multiplicative expansion scheme, however, we need to check the termination criterion across only the binary
sub-trees of the new trajectory.

to build it to completion.
A.4.2 Dynamic Termination Criteria Now we can ﬁnally consider explicit termination
criteria that can, to varying degrees of success, identify when a trajectory is long enough
to yield suﬃcient exploration of the neighborhood around the current energy level set. In
particular, we want to avoid both integrating too short, in which case we would not take full
advantage of the Hamiltonian trajectories, and integrating too long, in which case we waste
precious computational resources on exploration that yields only diminishing returns.
The ﬁrst criterion of this form was a heuristic introduced in the No-U-Turn sampler (Hoﬀ-
man and Gelman, 2014) that considered only the boundaries of a trajectory. Let z−(t) and
z+(t) be the boundaries of the trajectory t that can be reached by integrating backwards
and forwards in time, respectively (Figure 41). Similarly, denote q±(t) and p±(t) as the
position and momentum at each boundary. On Euclidean space we can then write the

Fig 41. The No-U-Turn termination criterion considers only the boundaries of a trajectory. The negative
boundary, z−(t), refers to the boundary that can be reached by integrating backwards in time, while the
positive boundary, z+(t) refers to the boundary that can be reached by integrating forwards in time.

Fig 42. (a) When the No-U-Turn termination criterion is not satisﬁed, expanding the trajectory in ei-
ther direction typically extends the trajectory further across the energy level set (grey) towards unexplored
neighborhoods. (b) When the No-U-Turn termination criterion is satisﬁed, however, further expansion typi-
cally contracts the boundaries of the trajectory towards each other and neighborhoods that have already been
explored. Stopping when the No-U-Turn termination criterion is just satisﬁed typically ensures that each
trajectory eﬃciently explores about half of the energy level set. Although this can be too aggressive, it works
well empirically and is far superior to any scheme with only a static integration time.

p+(t)T · (q+(t) −q−(t)) < 0
AND p−(t)T · (q−(t) −q+(t)) < 0.

This termination criterion is satisﬁed only when the momentum at both ends of the
trajectory are anti-aligned along the line connecting the positions at each boundary. In
this case we would expect further integration in either direction to bring the ends of the
trajectory closer together, which typically happens only when the trajectory has already
expanded across the width of the energy level set (Figure 42).
Unfortunately, the original No-U-Turn termination criterion is well-deﬁned only for Eu-
clidean manifolds where we can rigorously deﬁne subtraction between points, and hence is
inapplicable for non-Euclidean kinetic energies. Fortunately, however, the criterion can be
readily generalized. First note that on a Euclidean manifold

where T(t) is the integration time needed to reach the positive boundary of the trajectory,
z+(t), from the negative boundary, z+(t). Substituting this into (3), for example, allows us
to write the ﬁrst term of the No-U-Turn termination criterion as
